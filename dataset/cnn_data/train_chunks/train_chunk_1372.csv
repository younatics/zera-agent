"Ed Miliband delayed the start of the Iraq war inquiry by voting ‘again and again and again’ against it being set up, David Cameron said yesterday. The Prime Minister said the report’s conclusions would have been published ‘years ago’ had it not been for Labour MPs blocking the plans. Mr Miliband personally voted against an inquiry on four occasions. The issue erupted in the House of Commons after it emerged that Sir John Chilcot will not report until after the election. Scroll down for video . Criticism: David Cameron (left) accused Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) of delaying the start of the Iraq war inquiry during Prime Minister's Questions at the House of Commons in London yesterday . Despite the row dominating news bulletins all day, Mr Miliband skated over the issue at Prime Minister’s Questions – dismissing it in two sentences. The Labour leader did not even ask Mr Cameron about the issue, saying only that he agreed the report should be ‘published as soon as possible’. Labour MPs opposed a series of proposals for an inquiry in the Commons until one was ordered by Gordon Brown. Mr Miliband personally voted against starting an inquiry on four occasions as an MP, first in October 2006, then in June 2007, once more in March 2008 and again in March 2009. Several former senior Labour figures, including Mr Miliband’s brother David, will come under scrutiny when the report is finally published. At the start of Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Miliband said: ‘Let me start by saying, on the Iraq inquiry, that it was set up six years ago and I agree with the Prime Minister that it should be published as soon as possible.’ PMQs: The issue erupted in the House of Commons yesterday after it emerged that Sir John Chilcot will not report until after the election . Former prime minister: Labour MPs opposed a series of proposals for an inquiry in the Commons until one was ordered by Gordon Brown (above) He then moved swiftly on to the economy. The PM countered, saying the report would have been published ‘years ago’ had Labour MPs voted in favour of setting up the inquiry earlier. ‘So perhaps he could start by recognising his own regret at voting against the establishment of the inquiry,’ he said. Mr Miliband replied: ‘The inquiry was established six years ago, after our combat operations had ended, and frankly, my views on the Iraq war are well known and I want this inquiry to be published.’ Unlike his brother, Ed Miliband was not an MP in 2003 in the run-up to the war. At the time he was at Harvard University in the US. During his campaign for the Labour leadership he said the invasion was a ‘profound mistake’ and claimed to have opposed it in private. But according to reports, his brother dismissed this claim, saying that the only candidate for the leadership who could say they were against the war at the time was Diane Abbott.","Labour MPs prevented report being published 'years ago', claims PM .

"Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa denied Brazil victory with a performance that hasn't been seen by the host nation since Gordan Banks' famous save against Pele. Ochoa pulled off a succession of physics-defying stops as Mexico held out for a 0-0 draw against the tournament favourites in Fortaleza, leaving both teams level on four points in Group A. The Mexico No 1's most memorable stop resembled Banks' save during the group stages of the 1970 World Cup... and came against the heir to Pele's throne, Neymar. Scroll down for video...

Guillermo Ochoa's save resembled Gordan Banks' stop against Pele at 1970 World Cup . Stunned: Pele admits he 'couldn't believe' the ball didn't go in against England in Mexico '70 . How did he do that? Neymar can't believe his shot didn't go in as Brazil are held to a 0-0 draw with Mexico . The young Brazilian thought he had scored after directing a bullet header towards the bottom left corner only for Ochoa to prevent him with an incredible reflex save.

"A cash-strapped couple are hoping to fund their lavish wedding by auctioning off places at the ceremony to random strangers. Patsy O'Connor, 39, and fiancée Radina Hadshieva, 28, who live in Sofia, Bulgaria, plan to tie the knot in an extravagant Las Vegas on March 16, the day before St Patrick's Day. But when the potential cost spiralled to just less than £12,000, they quickly devised a way to grab some extra income. Patsy O'Connor, 39, and fiancee Radina Hadshieva, 28, who live in Sofia, Bulgaria, will wed in March . The pair are now auctioning off six seats to their nuptials, which will see winning bidders attend the ceremony and the reception, complete with free bar. After dancing the night away the strangers will then be free to join the happy couple and their other guests at the following morning's celebrations. Patsy has opened up the bidding at $300 (£198), which will rise in increments of $50 (£33) per bid. The fun-loving Irishman, who runs a web design business, said: 'Funding weddings is always an issue and there are a lot of websites where guests and friends can donate to help. Patsy has opened up the bidding at $300 (£198), which will rise in increments of $50 (£33) per bid . 'I'm always coming up with different and wacky ideas. This just popped into my head one morning. 'Radina was the first person I spoke to, she thought the idea was excellent and said, ""Go ahead and do it"". 'She doesn't mind if there's random strangers at our wedding. 'The only twist is the strangers have to bid for the chance to come. 'The other guests love the idea. I don't think they really care at all, if they are any random strangers. They are quite fun and outgoing people and they think the idea is brilliant. They said to definitely go for something big and wacky.' Patsy, of Cork, Ireland, and Bulgarian Radina met through friends three years ago but only became a couple eight months ago. The pair who live in Sofia, Bulgaria, began planning their wedding in Las Vegas after attending a friend's do in the same place. 'A Vegas wedding is a once in a lifetime experience I totally recommend,' Patsy added. 'If anyone had told me a year later I would be in Vegas for my own wedding, I wouldn't have believed them.' One morning, as the pair started planning their wedding, Patsy woke up with the idea to auction off seats to his wedding. He woke his future wife and excitedly told her the plan. Incredibly, she agreed. Patsy has now created a website where strangers can log on and bid, in an attempt to join the celebrations. Patsy, of Cork, Ireland, and Bulgarian Radina met through friends three years ago . The couple are set to wed on March 16 2015, before celebrating St Patrick's Day in Fremont Street in downtown Vegas with the entire wedding party the day after. Guests will have to make their own way to the American gambling capital however, and arrange their own accomodation. Patsy said: 'We will pick them up at a Las Vegas central location and they get transport to the wedding and back, with an open bar. 'They'll get the ceremony, the reception and the St Patrick's Day celebration the day after. 'Radina is Bulgarian and she is not your traditional woman, she wouldn't be agreeing to this otherwise, she is a little bit mad. We're a pretty good match.'

"A middle-class couple who pocketed £750,000 in a business con spent the money on luxury skiing holidays, shopping trips to Harrods and a £1.6million country manor. Philip Murray-Shelley, 45 and then-wife, Margaret Jean, 43, siphoned off cash from their own business to fund their life of luxury - and continued even as the firm was falling into serious financial difficulty. When the company went bust they turned their backs on staff and refused to pay out any compensation. Police said that employees were told they were being made redundant without pay-offs at the same time Mrs Murray-Shelley was on a skiing holiday paid for with company cash. The couple were jailed on Friday for more than seven years. Scroll down for video .

Former company boss Margaret Jean Murray-Shelley drove a Porsche 911, sent her children to public schools and kept horses at stables near her manor home in Brecon, Mid Wales. She took winter ski breaks to the Alps and went on expensive shopping trips to Harrods, funded by company cash. An earlier court hearing heard the 43-year-old received up to £1,000-a-day in company cash, even when her employees' jobs were at risk. Her former husband, who masterminded the fraud, also operated from a separate address in Gatcombe Road, London. The couple were jailed at Newport Crown Court along with two others after a three-year undercover investigation by police into the complex fraud behind their luxury lifestyle. Philip Murray-Shelley was sentenced to more than five years after admitting conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Sentencing, Judge Tom Crowther told him: 'This was your scheme. This was a sophisticated fraud that required constant attention and work.'

Above, their Porsche 911 . Margaret Jean was jailed for two years and six months after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. The couple, who have since divorced, ran MJL Group Ltd from Enterprise House at Navigation Park in Abercynon, south Wales. MJL Group provided professional services to other small firms. It operated by setting up agreements with a credit company for firms needing cash to complete deals. These small firms then arranged for the credit company to pay MJL in full and would pay the money back to the credit company in installments with interest. But MJL conned the credit company by creating a series of bogus business contracts to claim extra money. Not only did the credit company suffer a loss up to £750,000, but the employees of MJL also lost their jobs as money was stolen from company accounts to pay for the lavish lifestyles. Accountant Wayne Pulman, 63, from Swansea, was also part of the company scam and used his knowledge to hide the fraudulent activity. He was jailed for three years and six months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation, fraudulent trading and conspiracy to steal. Andrew Wallace was given a 20 month jail term, suspended for two years, for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Fraud: Margaret Murray-Shelley took winter ski breaks to the Alps and went on expensive shopping trips to Harrods, pictured, funded by company cash swindled during the complex financial con . Detective Sergeant Jamie Holcombe, of South Wales Police's Economic Crime Unit, said outside court: 'During the investigation company director Jean Murray-Shelley was found to be living in a large manor house in Brecon, valued at £1.6m, driving a Porsche 911, sending her children to public school and keeping several horses. 'At the same time MJL employees were being told they were being made redundant with no payment, Mrs Murray Shelley was on a skiing holiday paid for by funds taken out of the company. 'They continued to trade as a company whilst knowing their company was in serious financial difficulty, giving no notice to their employees of its foreseen closure.' He added: 'Following a three year investigation all four people were brought before the courts – such was the weight of evidence against them that Andrew Wallace and Philip Murray Shelley entered guilty pleas. 'Mrs Murray-Shelley and Wayne Pullman were subsequently found guilty by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court.' 'This case shows that crime is not only reserved to within streets or homes, but also within the business community by persons who portray a substantial level of professional credibility.'","Philip and Margaret Jean Murray-Shelley siphoned cash from their firm .

Dr Michael Mosley introduced the concept of intermittent fasting two years ago . Also known as intermittent fasting, the 5:2 diet was introduced by Dr Micheal Mosley in 2013. He says: 'One of the main things that intermittent fasting seems to do is switch on repair genes — genes whose job it is to keep the various bits of your body in good shape. 'The reason this happens is not fully understood; however, the evolutionary argument goes something like this. As long as we have plenty of food, our bodies remain in constant ‘go-go’ mode; it is like driving a car with your foot constantly on the accelerator. When you fast, the body’s initial reaction is one of shock. Signals go to the brain reminding you that you are hungry, urging you to find something to eat. But you resist. The body decides there must be a famine, so there is little point wasting energy on growth: instead, it gets cracking on some of the urgent maintenance tasks that it might have been putting off. As part of this repair process, the body breaks down and recycles old and tired cells (in a process called autophagy or ‘self eat’) getting rid of damaged or ageing parts to keep everything else in good working order. Fasting, it seems, also sparks the production of new cells. Recently, Professor Valter Longo of the University of Southern California published a study showing, for the first time, that fasting can switch on stem cells and regenerate the immune system. This has significance in the fight against cancer. Being able to create new white cells and build a more powerful immune system not only keeps infections at bay but also means mutating cells that might turn into a cancer are destroyed by the immune system long before they can multiply. There were initial concerns among the scientific community that fasting could harm the immune system, because when you starve, your system tries to save energy by recycling damaged immune cells. In the long run, this would be harmful, making you more vulnerable to infections. But Professor Longo discovered that if you fast for a very short period, and then eat, you get a re-bound effect, with the creation of new, more active cells. ‘We could not have predicted that fasting would have such a remarkable effect,’ he says. I am now convinced that intermittent fasting could have a game-changing effect on the nation’s health.'","Feast on lamb and salmon at The Balcon in St James, London .

"Dr Sally Norton warns a study that concluded most cases of cancer are the result of bad luck rather than unhealthy lifestyles could be detrimental to people's outlook on the disease . Most cases of cancer are just 'bad luck', not the result of an unhealthy lifestyle, diet or faulty genes inherited from our parents. That at least, is the conclusion of a recent study. Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine found that for two out of three cancer victims, the cumulative effect of random mistakes in genes is to blame for the disease - rather than poor choices about how they lived their lives. In the past, studies have estimated that 30 to 40 per cent of cancer cases would be avoided if a people improved their lifestyle. Here, one doctor argues that blaming cancer on just bad luck will encourage an unhealthy outlook on the disease for many people. Below, Dr Sally Norton, an NHS consultant specialising in weight loss and upper gastrointestinal surgery, aims to shed some light on the study... ........................................................................ Recent reports seem to have dubbed cancer as just down to ‘poor luck’ – something I personally think could be really quite detrimental to many people’s outlook on the disease. That’s just the media slant. However, I’m hoping I might be able to shed a little bit of light onto this matter. Firstly, the reports that you have seen will have been based on a recent study from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center in Baltimore. The study claims that as many as two thirds of cancer cases are the result of ‘bad luck’. But what does this really mean? The study looked at the rate of random mutations in stem cells of various body tissues, as they can be drivers of cancer. These mutations are errors that occur in our DNA during cell division and replication – the more that these mutations occur, the higher our chances of cancer. The researchers looked at 31 types of cancer, analysing the number of stem cell divisions in each type, to work out how much of a risk cell mutations caused. For two out of three cancer patients, the cumulative effect of random mistakes in genes is to blame, scientists at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine found . What they found was that 65 per cent of the cancers they analysed could be attributed to cell division, while the other 35 per cent could be put down to hereditary or environmental factors. However, the study was looking at tissues, not real people, and used computer models to extrapolate the results. It wasn’t able to categorically say how much lifestyle could actually affect the rate of these mutations – or indeed whether the mutations would go on to cause cancer. Cancers caused by bad luck: . Cancers caused by lifestyle: . For me, this information isn’t too shocking. We’ve all heard of, or known people whose cancer diagnosis was met with disbelief, because of their enviably healthy and active lifestyle. Put simply, cancer may indeed strike at random, or as the recent news stories have put it, seem to be ‘down to bad luck’. But it’s not quite that simple. Something many of the news stories have skipped over, is the fact that there are also many types of cancer that can be attributed to other factors – and in some cases, prevented by our own actions. We know that if we smoke like a chimney, our chances of getting lung cancer are at a much greater risk, or that excess alcohol can increase our risk of liver cancer. We know that viruses transmitted during unprotected sex can increase cervical cancer – which is why we are immunising teenage girls. We are hearing more and more often how a diet high in vegetables or fibre can reduce the risk of certain cancers and we know very clearly that obesity increases the risk of cancer too. So there are many types of cancer that are clearly influenced by lifestyle. What’s more, I have heard the leading researcher in this study say that he still believes that lifestyle is a very important factor in affecting your cancer risk, as a poor lifestyle could actually increase your risk of those cancer-causing mutations happening. So to sum up, while some cancers can be attributed to random DNA mutations (or just plain ‘bad luck’), there are many others that can in fact be helped by your efforts to stay fit and healthy. My advice to you? While nobody can guarantee that your healthy lifestyle will safeguard you entirely against cancer, the fact is that by keeping yourself fit and healthy you are helping to not only reduce your risk of getting certain cancers, but you’re helping to prevent numerous other diseases and illnesses, and helping to give yourself a healthier, more positive and energetic life to boot.","Dr Sally Norton says recent study blaming two in three cases of cancer on bad luck is detrimental to people's view of the disease .
Scientists in the US found in 65% of cases random mistakes in genes is to blame for the disease rather than poor lifestyle choices .
But Dr Norton argues while some cancers do strike out of the blue, ensuring you live a healthy lifestyle, getting plenty of exercise, is still key ."
"Thirteen years ago, on my 60th birthday, I decided to go clothes shopping. It's not a pastime I've ever particularly enjoyed, finding it boringly time-consuming, but my husband Michael is always encouraging me to treat myself, so off I went. I'd been feeling a little low about hitting this particular milestone birthday. Not many women like the sound of 'sixtysomething'. But as I fingered the rails at the British Designers Sale, a fantastic London-based club who hold a  knock-down sale at Chelsea Town Hall, I spotted them almost immediately. There they were - tight-fitting snakeskin trousers, the sort that would look more at home on a Kate (Moss) or a Victoria (Beckham). Daring to wear: Sandra in dungarees and a patterned dress as she has become more bold in her 70s . Certainly not the sort one would associate with a sexagenarian. But I had not come shopping with the intention of allowing age to let me slip into sartorial obscurity. I had come to make a statement, and I would be making it with leather, printed leather. They slid on and fitted perfectly and, after a cursory check of my rear view using my trusted compact mirror, I handed over £100 - far more than I am usually comfortable spending on a single item, but what the hell! I showed them to my husband who thought they were great fun, and I felt on top of the world. I couldn't help but smile. And I smiled again when I saw 55-year-old Emma Thompson on the red carpet last week, positively radiating confidence. Arriving at the premiere of her new film Walking On Sunshine in a vibrant red dress and patterned scarf, she was anything but conventional - but she looked glorious. Approval: Sandra's husband Michael Howard is a fan of her fun fashion choices . Oscar-winner Emma tends to play rather prim roles. This outfit was anything but. Cut down to the ankles, it looked feminine and the scarf was cut on the bias, adding an even more eccentric feel. She teamed those with a multi-coloured chain necklace and patent bronze heels, as well as black glasses. Her blonde hair was scraped back off her face. As she shot the photographers a wide grin and then went to greet her fans, I thought she looked marvellous. It's not that long ago that women of a certain age had to conform to a rigid style canon which set out skirt length (below the knee)  and appropriate evening wear (never trousers). My own mother, like most wartime women, wore the same clothes all her life - plain wool skirt, plain blouse or jumper. It was simply expected. Now, things are different. We can wear jeans to red carpet events. Clashing colours are considered stylish. Why shouldn't that freedom extend to women over 50? Since that day with the snakeskin trousers, I look for clothes that make me stand out. Rifling through my drawers you'll find a pair of shocking pink sunglasses bought in Spain for one euro that I wear all the time. Fab fashionistas: Sandra admired Emma Thompson's recent red carpet look, left, and always thinks Judi Dench looks good . There are emerald green jeans by Apanage I bought at the Designer Sale. I wear them to all kinds of events, including cruises. I have sparkly white jeans and a splashy LK Bennett black-and-white dress I wear for book talks. It never fails to make me feel wonderful - especially when I team it with bright orange toenails. It seems that I'm in great company when it comes to shattering convention in my later years. Judi Dench, who is nearing 80, looks terrific in everything. Although Helena Bonham Carter is a mere 48, I can't imagine her clothes will become any less outrageous as she hits her 50s. Indeed, many of my friends believe that fashion gets more fun as you get older. I have one incredible barrister friend in her 60s who regularly wears sparkly cowboy boots and wild headbands. Another friend, Rosa Monckton, is instinctively stylish and throws together wonderfully exotic and original clothes. Of course there are moments when I think, 'Oh... dear.' But if I'm in doubt, I canvass the opinion of one of my two sons, Sholto, 51, or Nick, 38. They either say: 'Yes, mum you look great', or 'No, you can't be seen in that'. I'm happy to discard something on  their advice. It might seem like a double standard, but the key - I believe - to carrying off an outrageous look is feeling confident. And that means knowing when to say no. Accessorise: Sandra got lots of compliments when she wore this chunky necklace recently . When I was 70, I did a shoot for a woman's magazine and they produced a pair of really tight skinny jeans. I said I couldn't possibly wear them as they'd make my hips look huge. The stylists then produced a long flowing grey top and a crocheted silver-threaded cardigan to lay over them - and I felt incredible. There are times when I hold back. There comes a point in every woman's life where your upper knees and arms are no longer a thing of beauty and there's nothing you can do about it. Many is the time I've tried on a sleeveless dress or a skirt that is just a little too short and it's come straight off again. But even then, when a style has really suited me, I've broken my own rules. I've got a fantastic black leather dress which I adore and that has no sleeves. Jeans can be particularly cruel, so when you find a pair that suit, treasure them. I have several. There is another myth about fashion and growing older. Some women claim that they no longer need to dress to impress, but to that I say, poppycock! We still want to turn a head or two,  even though we can claim a  bus pass. Some people might accuse me of being disingenuous. Being a slim size 10 - or a size 12 on some days - and a former fashion model means I've always been a bit of a clothes horse. But that's missing the point. I know plenty of people who are wide, small, fat, thin and can wear wonderfully outrageous clothes. It's not about size. My advice to any woman wanting to break the fashion mould is to start off small, perhaps by accessorising an outfit with some offbeat clunky jewellery and just see how many compliments you pick up. Michael is always buying me bits of over-sized jewellery. I wore a fabulous chunky colourful necklace to the Costa Book Awards recently and so many people told me how terrific it looked. Focus on your best feature. I have a small waist so wear clothes that show that off. But I hate my legs and prefer to draw attention away from those - wearing cut-off trousers with orange toenails peeping through distracts wonderfully. Get your colours 'done'. I went to a charity coffee morning a few years ago where a few friends and I had it done and was told that I suited zingy oranges and brilliant yellows. I could immediately see the difference, these colours 'lifted' me and I wear them regularly now. But most of all, be brave. When you look in the mirror and you're not sure if those jeans or that top are suitable for your age, say  those four magic words 'To hell with it' and walk out into the world. I promise, you'll look fantastic - just like Emma!","Model thinks women shouldn't fade away as they age .

"'Potatoes, thank goodness! That's a good start,' former Mythbusters host Grant Imahara says as he goes on to reveal the 13 other ingredients contained in a humble McDonald's fry. The TV personality traveled to the fast food chain's potato processing plant in Idaho to see the production process from start to finish. During his investigation he found that there are two rounds of frying. He also discovered that dimethylpolysiloxane - a form of silicone found in Silly Putty - is used in the making of McDonald's fries along with a petrol-based chemical called tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ). Scroll down for video . Learning curve: Mythbusters host Grant Imahara traveled to the fast food chain's potato processing plant in Idaho to see the production process from start to finish . However, he reassures viewers that these are both safe additives used for perfectly good reasons. Dimethylpolysiloxane, which Imahara struggles to pronounce, is added for safety reasons to prevent cooking oil from foaming. While tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) is applied as a food preservative. Imahara explains that there are numerous steps involved in the creation of McDonald's fries. First potatoes are harvested from fields before being peeled, cut and blanched. They're then fired through a cutter at up to 70 miles an hour into thin sticks. After being chiseled into the perfect shape, the strips of potato are sauced with a blend of canola oil, soybean oil, hydrongenated soybean oil, natural beef flavor, hydrolyzed wheat, hydrolyzed milk, citric acid and dimethylpolysiloxane. Raw product: First potatoes are harvested from fields before being peeled, cut and blanched . Multi-step process: Here they are seen on a conveyor belt at the factory in Idaho . Getting the right shape: The washed potatoes are then fired through a cutter at up to 70 miles an hour into thin sticks - here Imahara holds up the fry slicer . Dextrose - a natural sugar - is sprayed on the batons to help them maintain a golden fried color. Sodium acid pyrophosphate is also added to prevent the fries from going grey. Last but not least, salt is sprinkled on for flavor. The fries are then flash frozen at the Simplot factory and transported to McDonald's outlets across the country. Once they are at restaurants, the potato sticks are fried for a second time. The oil blend is similar to the factory mix, with the addition of tertiary butylhydroquinone  and hydrogenated soybean oil - a manufactured form of trans fat. And voila! McDonald's World Famous Fries are served. Finishing touches: After they are sliced the potato sticks are sauced in an oil blend, coated in dextrose to maintain their golden fried color and sprinkled with salt . Almost there: The fries are flash frozen before being shipped to restaurants where they are fried for a second time - they are not vegetarian or gluten free . Your meal is served: A large serving of the finished product contains 510 calories, 6gms of protein, 24gms of fat, 67gms of carbs and 290mgs of sodium . A large serving of the finished product contains 510 calories, 6gms of protein, 24gms of fat, 67gms of carbs and 290mgms of sodium. The recipe for McDonald's French Fries differs greatly in the UK where it does not include the Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Canola Oil and, notably, the Dimethylpolysiloxane, according to a study by 100daysofrealfood.com. McDonald’s digital series 'Our Food. Your Questions' comes as the company fights to boost its performance in the U.S., where sales slid at established locations in the last quarter of 2014. In addition to increased competition, McDonald's is trying to keep up with changing tastes, with places such as Chipotle marketing their food as more wholesome alternatives. To improve the image of its food, McDonald's recently rolled out chicken wraps with sliced cucumbers and the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches. It also plans to eventually let people swap out the French fries in value meals with options like salad or vegetables. Do you use real potatoes for your fries? Yep. The most common ones we use include the Russet Burbank, Ranger Russet, Umatilla Russet and the Shepody - varieties known for producing a flavorful fry that's crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. How do you make your fries? The potatoes we use for our World Famous Fries are made from varieties including Russet Burbank, Ranger Russet, Umatilla Russet and the Shepody. The suppliers we work with first peel, cut and blanch the potatoes. They then dry, partially fry and flash freeze the fries for our restaurants. Once in our kitchens, we cook them in our Canola blend oil so you can have them crispy and hot - just the way you like them. Do you add any type of flavor when preparing your fries? Yes. When our suppliers partially fry our cut potatoes, they use an oil blend that contains beef flavoring. This ensures the great-tasting and recognizable flavor we all love about our World Famous Fries. The fries are finally seasoned with salt after they’re cooked in our kitchens and served hot to you. What kind of oil do you use to cook your fries? We use an oil blend made from four different kinds of oils: canola, corn, soybean and hydrogenated soybean. This ensures the savory flavor and crispy texture of the World Famous Fries you love so much. How much salt do you add to your fries? We add a small amount of salt to our fries after we've cooked them in our kitchen. Can I order fries without added salt? Sure. You can still enjoy the great taste of our World Famous Fries without salt. Just ask for no salt when placing your order and we'll be happy to prepare a batch for you. Please understand it's possible a small amount of salt may be transferred from the bin or the scoop. Are your fries vegetarian friendly? At this time, none of our menu items are certified as vegetarian or vegan. The oil our suppliers use to partially fry our World Famous Fries has a natural beef flavoring, which also contains hydrolyzed milk as a starting ingredient, added to enhance the taste. It’s important to note that, despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation equipment, areas and utensils, and there is a possibility for your food items to come in contact with other food products. Are the fries at McDonald’s gluten-free? Currently, we don’t offer a gluten-free menu. The oil our suppliers use to partially fry our fries has a small amount of flavoring that uses hydrolyzed wheat as one of its starting ingredients. We also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations could involve some shared cooking and preparation areas, equipment and/or utensils. Bottom line: we know all of our customers may have different needs. So, talk to your health care provider for possible meal options. How would you recommend reheating your fries once they're cold? Our World Famous Fries are best enjoyed when they’re served fresh and hot. For that reason, we don't recommend any specific reheating method.","Mythbusters host Grant Imahara traveled to the fast food chain's potato processing plant in Idaho to see the production process from start to finish .

"Forensic experts and archaeologists are desperately trying to discover the origins of a 132-year-old rifle found propped up against a tree in the Nevada wilderness. The .44-40 calibre Winchester rifle was found frozen in time on a remote rocky outcrop in the heart of the Grand Basin National Park. Archaeologists discovered the gun, which was manufactured in 1882, leaning against a juniper tree while they were carrying out surveys. Now they are poring over old newspaper cuttings and historical texts to try and identify its original owner, while forensic experts are taking what clues they can from the gun itself to try and understand how it came to rest against the tree. The rusted and decaying butt of the rifle reveals it was let exposed to the elements for more than 100 years . The gun barrel (pictured) was heavily rusted, indicating it had sat exposed to wet weather for a long period of time . Archaeologist Eva Jensen removes dirt from around the butt of the Winchester rifle, found as it is pictured propped up against a tree . Experts do not yet know for certain how long it had been there, but with its wooden base discoloured and partially buried and the metal barrel rusted, it is possible the rifle could have been undisturbed for more than a century. Archaeologist Eva Jensen, whose research party discovered the rifle, is now intent on solving the mystery. She has begun poring over the newspapers printed at the time - the Ward Reflex and White Pine County Record - which both covered the area's then-mining industry, looking through historical bills of sale, as well as family histories, the Los Angeles Times reported. She said: 'One thing we all assumed was that someone here had a very bad day. One of the staff said, ""Why do you set your gun down and forget where you put it? That just doesn't happen"".' The Washington Post reports that the Great Basin was a mining site at the time the gun was manufactured, but that farming was also common in the area and the rifle may also have been used for game hunting. In 1882, 25,000 Winchester rifles of that make were produced costing about $25 each, indicating that they were in plentiful supply. The newspaper quotes Basin National Park chief of interpretation Nichole Andler as saying: ‘It looked like someone propped it up there, sat down to have their lunch and got up to walk off without it. Discovery: The .44-40 calibre Winchester rifle  was found frozen in time in the heart of the Grand Basin National Park . The rifle, known as 'The gun that won the West' is one of the most popular selling rifles in US history . Archaeologists discovered the gun, which was manufactured in 1882, leaning against a juniper tree while they were carrying out surveys . ‘It probably has a very good and interesting story, but it probably is a story that could have happened to almost anyone living this sort of extraordinary existence out here in the Great Basin Desert.’ Experts are scouring local archives in a bid to piece together the history of the weapon, which was found unloaded in November. A statement on the National Park's Facebook page says: 'The park will provide a viewing opportunity for the community before sending the rifle to conservators to stabilize the wood and apply museum conservation techniques. 'The treatment will keep the gun looking as it was found and prevent further deterioration.' John Wayne with a Winchester rifle in the 1961 Western, The Comancheros . Winchester Model 1873 rifles hold a prominent place in America's history, having been the most successful of the gun-maker's products. They are often referred to as 'the gun that won the west' thanks to its popularity with Western settlers in the 1800s. According to the Great Basin National Park Facebook page, 720,610 were manufactured between 1873 and 1916 when production finally came to an end. In 1882 alone, over 25,000 were made and their accessibility meant prices plummeted from about $50 when they first came out to just $25 in 1882. They were so widely used that they became known as 'everyman's' rifle and became an important part of life on the frontier. A lever-action breech mechanism allowed users to unleash a number of shots before having to reload. Typical guns weighed about 9.5lbs and were nearly 50ins long with a barrel length of 30ins. Winchester went on to produce three variations of the Model 1873: the rifle, carbine, and musket. Production of the earlier Model 1866 had started in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1867. Its prominent role in the nation's history is reflected in its use in a series of Hollywood Westerns including 'Stagecoach' with John Wayne and 'Winchester '73' starring James Stewart.","Weapon was found leaning against juniper tree in Nevada's Grand Basin .

"Support for the Greens has doubled since the Labour party set up a special unit to counter threat from the smaller party, a new poll revealed today. A YouGov survey put the Green party on 10 per cent and Labour slumped to 30 per cent, its lowest rating with the pollster for five years. Labour's Sadiq Khan admitted that since being put in charge of the anti-Green unit more people had begun 'flirting with the minor parties'. A new YouGov survey puts the Greens on 10 per cent, up from 5 per cent when the Labour party set up a unit designed to tackle the threat of the minor party . The Green party has been boosted by the row in recent weeks over its exclusion by the broadcasters from the planned TV debates. The party boasts that its membership had reached 44,175 in England and Wales, higher than the 41,943 claimed by Ukip last week and almost level with the 44,526 issued by the Liberal Democrats in November. While the Tories have long feared the loss of support to Ukip, the Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously. In October, Labour announced it had set up a unit to tackle the threat posed by the Greens appealing to left-leaning voters. Party sources described how Mr Khan was 'well placed to reach out to a group of voters who lie to the left of most of the public and who were alienated during the New Labour years'. At the time the party was securing around 5 per cent in YouGov opinion polls. Today's survey puts the Greens up to 10 per cent, while Labour are down to 30 per cent, having been on 38 per cent on the start of October. Labour's Sadiq Khan admitted support for the Green party had risen since he was put in charge of a unit designed to stop voters switching to the minor party . Appearing on BBC Two's Daily Politics, Mr Khan said today: 'There are a number of people who are currently flirting with voting Green' Challenged about who was responsible for ensuring Labour does not haemorrhage support to the Greens, he eventually admitted. 'I'm in charge of the Green work.' Presenter Andrew Neil noted that since being put in charge of tackling the Green threat, support for the party had doubled. Mr Khan conceded the work had failed so far: 'You can draw a graph, and there is a link... There are a number of people flirting with the minor parties and our job is to persuade them to vote Labour.' Green party leader Natalie Bennett this week predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics'. Data from the 2010 general election shows the extent to which support for Labour has fallen dramatically . She said it was vital for her party to be included in any TV debates to provide balance as voters are moving away from the 'old boys' club' of Westminster. Ms Bennett was speaking at the launch of a poster campaign aimed at the leaders of the main parties, entitled 'What are you afraid of, boys?', to challenge broadcasters to include the Greens in any televised debates between party leaders. A separate poll by Lord Ashcroft puts the Greens on 11 per cent. The Tories were ahead on 29 per cent and Labour on 28 per cent. Ukip was on 15 per cent, and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. One in five people saying they would back the Greens voted Lib Dem in 2010, precisely the people Labour needs to woo to win.","YouGov survey puts Greens on 10%, up from 5% in October last year .

"Some beauty products are centuries old — virtually unchanged since 19th-century apothecaries came up with the formulation, and still on our chemists’ shelves. But do they stand the test of time when pitted against modern counterparts? We put some bestsellers to the test... 1911 Nivea Creme, £3.50 . 2013 Nivea Cellular Anti-Age Skin Rejuvenation Day Cream with SPF 15, £14.99 . An emulsifying agent named Eucerit was the basis for Nivea, a product that its makers claimed was ‘the first stable water-in-oil skin cream’. Last year, the brand launched the Cellular Anti-Age range, ‘to boost the skin’s surface cell renewal for a more youthful look’. Nivea Cream in 1911 (left) and 2013 Nivea Cellular Anti-Age Skin Rejuvenation Day Cream with SPF 15 (right) The Verdict: There doesn’t seem much evidence to substantiate claims for cell renewal, but the newer product did feel superior. It smelt like a slightly more perfumed version of classic Nivea, went on more easily and was more quickly absorbed, which Harley Street cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting put down to the shea butter it contains. However, five minutes after I’d applied them there was little to choose between the two. ‘The addition of sunscreen filters gives the updated version a clear advantage,’ says Dr Bunting. ‘But for those with very dry skin, plain old Nivea is excellent value for money. Just don’t skimp on sunscreen afterwards.’ The Winner: Original — it’s less than a quarter of the price and can be used night and day if you put an SPF on top. 1953 Max Factor Creme Puff, £5.99 . 2007 Max Factor Miracle Touch Liquid Illusion Foundation, £12.99 . Although normally used these days as a powder on top of foundation, the Creme Puff was launched as an all-in-one base and powder. More than 50 years later, Miracle Touch, which ‘transforms on contact with the skin from a solid foundation into a lightweight supple liquid’, was launched. The Verdict: Both products gave a matte finish but the Creme Puff didn’t offer as much coverage and left skin looking flat and powdery. I know a lot of people love its retro smell but I’m not a fan. The Winner: New — as a foundation Miracle Touch definitely wins, but the Creme Puff is good for removing shine on the go. 1953 Max Factor Creme Puff (left) and 2007 Max Factor Miracle Touch Liquid Illusion Foundation (right) 1863 Bourjois Little Round Pot Blush, £7.99 . 2013 Bourjois Little Round Pot Cream Blush, £7.99 . When Parisian actor Joseph-Albert Ponsin started making stage make-up, he created a blusher by mixing powder with water and mother-of-pearl, then baking it in a mould. Little Round Pot Blush has been in production ever since. In 2013, it was reinvented as a cream-to-powder formulation. The Verdict: The packaging of the newer blush is about half the size as it doesn’t contain a brush or applicator — you just use your fingers. But it lacks the original’s sweet rose scent and has a similarly powdery finish. The Winner: Original — it comes in 12 shades, smells divine and is as blendable as the new version. 1863 Bourjois Little Round Pot Blush, £7.99 (left) and the same product in 2013 (right) which is the same price . 1930 Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream Skin Protectant, £26 . 2009 Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream Intensive Daily Face Moisturiser SPF15, £30 . 2009 Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream Intensive Daily Face Moisturiser SPF15, £30 . This blend of lanolin, petroleum jelly and paraffin got its name from a customer who claimed that the cream helped to heal her son’s scraped knee in eight hours. Almost 80 years later, a moisturiser was launched promising moisturising for up to eight hours as well as protection from extreme weather and sun. The Verdict: Eight Hour Cream is a thick, waxy balm with a strong, almost medicinal scent that people either love or hate. You wouldn’t normally apply it over your whole face but it’s undeniably good for dry lips and cuticles. I find it too greasy to use as hand cream. The new moisturiser has a lighter, fresher scent and absorbs easily. Dr Bunting warns that the combination of sun filters might not protect you all day. The Winner: Original — if you don’t mind the smell, it will help to lock in moisture. 1960 Elnett Hair Spray, from £2.39 . 2014 Elnett Volume Excess, from £2.39 . Before Elnett, which was designed to be strong enough to fix hairstyles yet allow movement, hair lacquer was exactly that — it set hard. In 1969 a micro-diffusion cap was added to give a finer spray. The latest version, Volume Excess, contains particles that give texture and lift to mimic a backcombed effect. A 1960s UK L'Oreal magazine advert for Elnett (left) and 2014 Elnett Volume Excess hairspray, £2.39 (right) The Verdict: True to its promise, the original holds but brushes out easily. The newer version also holds and, according to trichologist Philip Kingsley, does so more effectively. Volume Excess is designed to be used like dry shampoo — sprayed in and brushed out, leaving behind particles that create volume and grip. The Winner: New. Unless you really don’t want volume, the new one offers all the hold of the original, plus extra oomph. And as we wash our hair more frequently now, who cares if it doesn’t brush out as easily? 1870 Vaseline Original Petroleum Jelly, £2.80 . 2014 Vaseline Intensive Rescue Moisture Locking Cream, £3.29 . Vaseline was developed after a chemist noticed workers on an oil rig using a refinery by-product to heal cuts and burns. The latest version is a body lotion infused with micro-droplets of the original petroleum jelly. In clinical tests, it was shown to provide twice as much moisture as E45 cream. The Verdict: Both products are fragrance-free but while the original is thick and waxy, the cream soaks quite easily into the skin. ‘Plain old Vaseline will lock in moisture,’ says Dr Bunting, ‘but it will make a mess of a blouse, so apply only to lips and ultra-dry areas such as heels or elbows at night.’ The Winner: New — just as moisturising but far more practical. An advert for Vaseline the 1910s shows how it came in a tube (left) while Vaseline Intensive Rescue Moisture Locking Cream, £3.29, (right) now comes in a plastic tub. The recent product is deemed 'far more practical' 1950 Olay Beauty Fluid, £4.99 . 2014 Olay Regenerist Replenishing Cream, £21.99 . Beauty Fluid was devised by a South African chemist whose wife was frustrated by thick, greasy creams. The latest Olay launch, Regenerist Replenishing Cream, contains ingredients that claim to give firmer, younger-looking skin. The Verdict: Both products are easily absorbed, although the Beauty Fluid left skin feeling a little sticky in comparison, and smelt slightly old-fashioned. But according to Dr Bunting, it’s the ingredients that count. ‘High levels of niacinamide, known to boost barrier function and even out skin tone, make the new cream a hugely improved formulation.’ The Winner: New — why wouldn’t you pick a more sophisticated moisturiser with proven antiageing ingredients? An advert in the 1950s for Olay shows how products came in a round tub (left) while the 2014 Olay Regenerist Replenishing Cream, £21.99, is packaged in a box. The new product is deemed the 'more sophisticated' 1967 Rimmel London Hide Blemish Concealer, £3.99 . 2012 Rimmel Wake Me Up Concealer, £5.49 . This waxy concealer was a Sixties bestseller — but concealers evolved from stick to cream formulations and in 2012 Rimmel launched its Wake Me Up product, which promises an ‘instant anti-fatigue effect’ under the eyes and complete coverage for spots and other blemishes. The Verdict: The original feels greasy and cakey and doesn’t blend easily into the skin. Its coverage didn’t seem great unless it was applied and then set with powder. The new formulation goes on smoothly and has a finish that isn’t so shiny that it makes spots stand out. The Winner: New — the Sixties version feels inferior. 2012 Rimmel Wake Me Up Concealer, £5.49 (left) and Johnson’s Baby Easy Rinse Foaming Shampoo (right) 1954 Johnson’s Baby Shampoo, £3.35 for 500ml . 2013 Johnson’s Baby Easy Rinse Foaming Shampoo, £3.13 for 250ml . This was the first product formulated to be as mild to a baby’s eyes as water — hence ‘No more tears’. The latest shampoo, which comes in a pump dispenser, was launched last year. The Verdict: The original shampoo is simple and effective. Its smell is unremarkable, unlike the new one which has a fruity, apple fragrance. According to trichologist Philip Kingsley, though, the formulations aren’t that different. The Winner: Original — it’s about half the price of the new product and just as effective.","Some beauty products are centuries old and are still being updated .

"A schizophrenic Queens man who last year pleaded guilty to stalking Anderson Cooper told a Manhattan judge yesterday the CNN anchor's partner has been terrorizing him via the internet. Alex Hausner, 40, told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Charles Solomon that Cooper's longtime boyfriend,  Benjamin Maisani, has threatened his life online and that he feels 'in danger'. The psychiatric patient said that 'acquaintances' and 'surrogates' of the nightclub owner 'have possibly contributed to this' and that 'they use their cellphones to follow me around'. Scroll down for video . Alex Hausner told a Manhattan judge that Anderson Cooper's longtime boyfriend, Benjamin Maisani, has been threatening his life online . Hausner said that Maisani (left) has put his life 'in danger' but he will 'always have feelings' for CNN host Cooper (right) If Hausner avoids having any contact with Cooper (right) and Maisani (left) he'll avoid jail and be sentenced to five years of probation . While addressing the court, Hausner rambled about Maisani and his connection to 'scumbag society', according to the New York Daily News. 'I am under the impression that some of the people, various people from various places, might actually be some sort of surrogate for Mr Maisani. 'Again there are many different facets of scumbag society.' Hausner pleaded guilty to felony menacing and harassment charges last April and received no jail time as part of the deal. On Tuesday, he confirmed he was complying with   psychiatric treatment the court ordered him to undergo after stalking Cooper, 47. That was the judge's primary focus during the hearing and he said Hausner's claims against Maisani, were 'problems to deal with separately'.

"Manchester United are dealing with a mice infestation at Old Trafford. A hygiene report, seen by Sportsmail, reveals United are working with pest-control contractors to sort out problems with rodents in the North and South stands. And it is understood that the vermin problem has spread to other parts of the ground, with rodents even spotted in staff offices. VIDEO Scroll down to watch MOUSECHESTER DERBY: Mouse on the pitch at Old Trafford . Manchester United have an infestation of mice  Old Trafford and have called in pest control . The rodents have been reported in the North and South stands of the ground . Mice, one pictured here at Old Trafford in November 2013 vs Arsenal, have even been spotted in staff offices . In 2006, Burton Albion players (left) complained after their FA Cup defeat at United that mice were on the pitch . United won the match 5-0 but the rodents were evident on the hallowed Old Trafford turf during the game . Mice were also seen during United's 3-0 Premier League win against West Ham in August 2010 . On the back of the news that there is a mouse infestation at Old Trafford, here's our Rodent squad... Goalkeeper: Andy Nibble . Defence: Razvan Rat, David Lu-cheese, Mouse Mats Hummels, Thomas Vermin-aelen, Ashley Hole . Midfield: Vasyl Rats, Mickey Mouse Thomas, Rat Nevin, Edam Hazard, Mathieu FlaMini-Mouse, Curtis Woodmouse . Strikers: Lionel Mousey, Kevin 'Mighty Mouse' Keegan, Roy Rat Race . Manager: Giovanni Trapattoni . ‘They’re a nightmare and they are struggling to get rid of them,’ a source said. The problem is thought to be linked to the famous stadium’s canalside location. In 2012, a similar report identified issues with mice in the staff canteen at the Stretford End while in 2010 a mouse was pictured scurrying over the pitch during United’s victory over West Ham. Six years earlier, Burton players complained that there were mice all over the pitch during their FA Cup clash with United. The hygiene report, carried out last year, tells staff to ‘continue to act on the recommendations of the pest-control contractor in connection with the mice activity’. It also advises them to make sure no food or waste is left out. United say they carry out weekly checks and implement ‘immediate and appropriate action’ if mice are spotted. A club spokesperson said: ‘Manchester United implements a robust pest-control system throughout Old Trafford. As the report acknowledges, weekly checks are made in all catering areas and stringent measures are taken to ensure high levels of hygiene and cleanliness wherever food is stored, prepared and served. If incidences of this nature do occur at the stadium, immediate and appropriate action will be taken.’ United's last match at Old Trafford saw them fall 1-0 to Southampton due to a Dusan Tadic strike . The midfield playmaker took his shirt off in celebration after his second-half strike at Old Trafford . Sportsmail has also obtained the latest two hygiene reports from each Premier League ground in which a number of issues are reported, although most clubs were given top marks. Mould was found in ice machines at Aston Villa and Swansea while Villa were advised that they did not have enough female stewards working on matchdays and told to keep an eye out for female fans smoking in the Holte End toilets. Both reports, however, gave the West Midlands club a 5/5 rating. At Anfield, inspectors found probe thermometers — used to check the temperatures of pies — were not being cleaned effectively between use and Liverpool were told to provide wipes. Arsenal were told that some concessions staff at the Emirates Stadium were not changing gloves as often as they should, while at Leicester inspectors found droppings in the walk-in chiller. The club was told to remove them and disinfect the floor and the latest report gave them a clean bill of health and a 5/5 rating. United's next match at home is against Leicester City in the Premier League on January 31 . Kevin Keegan was nicknamed 'Mighty Mouse' at Hamburg during his three years at the club between 1977-80 . Stoke were found to be using the same vacuum packer for raw and cooked foods at the Britannia Stadium. The Potteries club were warned about cross-contamination. West Brom were also informed of the same problem. At Crystal Palace, inspectors said an ill-fitting kitchen door could allow pests inside and asked the club to fix it. At Tottenham, a 2012 report said inspectors found paintwork in a kitchen to be in a ‘poor condition’ while ventilation grills were in need of more regular cleaning. But the most recent report, in 2014, gave Spurs a clean bill of health. Other than a broken oven door and slight damage to a wall, there were no issues at Hull.

"US Border Patrol agents escort a group of undocumented immigrants into custody as they try to cross the Rio Grande - a hotspot for illegal immigration on the Mexican border with Texas. Rio Grande Valley arrests rose 65 . per cent last year and they hit 16,000 in March alone, fuelled by human smugglers who pay tax to drug cartels. Attempts to cross the border alone are met with violence. About 70 bodies were found in the area in the six months from October, more than twice as many as the same period in the previous year. Border Patrol agents escort a group of undocumented immigrants in the Rio Grande Valley . Three sets of remains wait to be picked up and examind after they were exhumed in Falfurrias, Texas . Just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas, stands a dormitory-style shelter filled with people recently deported and other migrants waiting to cross the border. The long rows of bunk beds offer immigrants a place to rest on their long journey. But the shelter is no safe haven in a town controlled by the Gulf cartel. Armed men once showed up and took away 15 men, who were probably put to work as gunmen, lookouts or human mules hauling bales of marijuana into the United States. As Congress takes up immigration reform, lawmakers may have to confront the reality of this place and others like it, where people say the current system of immigration enforcement and deportation produces a constant flow of people north and south that provides the cartel with a vulnerable labor pool and steady source of revenue. 'This vicious circle favours organised crime because the migrant is going to pay for safe passage', said the Rev. Francisco Gallardo, who oversees immigrant-assistance efforts for the Matamoros Catholic diocese. The cartel controls who crosses the border and profits from each immigrant by taxing human smugglers. At the shelter, the cartel threat was so alarming that shelter administrators began encouraging immigrants to go into the streets during the day, thinking they would be harder to round up than at the shelter. There have been record numbers of deportations in recent years and tens of thousands landed in Tamaulipas already this year, the state that borders Texas from Matamoros to Nuevo Laredo. Arizona is often singled out as the busiest border crossing for immigrants entering the US, but more and more migrants are being caught in the southernmost tip of Texas, in the Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector. The Rio Grande snakes westward, forming the border between Mexico, left, and the US near Havana, Texas . Members of Baylor University forensic team exhume body of an unclaimed illegal immigrant in Falfurrias, Texas . The Rio Grande Valley area has become the busiest sector for illegal immigration on the US-Mexico border . Those arrested, pictured, are part of a 50 per cent increase in illegal immigration in the last year . Apprehension statistics are imperfect measures because they only capture a fraction of the real flow, but the arrest numbers are definitely shifting. Arrests in the Tucson, Ariz., sector dropped 3 per cent last year, while Rio Grande Valley arrests rose 65 percent. The makeup of the immigrants apprehended here is changing, too, driven by people flowing out of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The Border Patrol made 94,532 arrests of non-Mexican immigrants along the south-west border last year, more than double the year before. And nearly half of those came in the Rio Grande Valley sector. The Border Patrol is responding by redirecting personnel, sending most new graduates from its academy to the Rio Grande Valley, according to senior Border Patrol officials. When immigrants from Central America and Mexico arrive in Matamoros ahead of their trip to America, they are met by smugglers who have to pay the cartel tax for every person they take across the border. Attempts to cross alone are met with violence. Some immigrants are kidnapped and their families extorted by the organisation. Reported murders in Tamaulipas, the state that borders Texas from Matamoros to Nuevo Laredo, increased more than 250 percent in the past four years, according to the Mexican government. Official statistics are generally thought to undercount the real toll. Soldiers recently killed six gunmen in a clash in Matamoros. And yet, even with the high-degree of danger for immigrants crossing this part of the border, they keep coming. Members of University of Indianapolis archeology and forensics laboratory dig up the casket of an illegal immigrant at the Sacred Heart Burial Park in Falfurrias, Texas . The Rio Grande, which forms the border, is a hotspot for illegal immigration . Tracks left by the US Border Patrol await immigrant footprints in a field near the border . Central American migrants continue to use the route up the Gulf Coast side of Mexico and through Tamaulipas because it's the shortest to the US, said Rodolfo Casillas Ramirez, a professor at Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales in Mexico City. The smugglers choose the route, and even if immigrants have heard about the violence in Tamaulipas, 'they trust that the premium they've paid includes the right of passage,' he said. They continue to leave their home countries for economic reasons. Although the US economy has provided fewer jobs for immigrants during the Great Recession and a long, slow recovery, opportunities south of the border have been even more limited, Casillas said. That's why the Rev. Alejandro Solalinde, a Roman Catholic priest who founded a shelter for immigrants in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, said the answer is in regional development, not increased border security. 'This situation has grown because ultimately the migrants are merchandise and organised crime profits in volume,' he said during a recent visit to Matamoros. Filemon Vela, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee whose district includes Brownsville, said the immigration-reform debate has so far left out discussion of the security and economic development in Mexico. 'The incentive for people to cross over illegally from Mexico will never subside until these individuals feel safe and until they are able to feed themselves and their families,' Vela said. At the 150-bed shelter, more than half of the immigrants have just been deported from the US, Gallardo said. The others are immigrants preparing to cross. He said shelter workers constantly chase out infiltrators who are paid by smugglers to recruit inside. At Solalinde's shelter in southern Mexico, threats from organised crime forced them to bring in four state police officers and four federal ones, who have lived at his shelter for the past year as protection. Solalinde now travels with bodyguards after having fled Mexico for a couple of months last year following threats. One immigrant at the Matamoros shelter was a 48-year-old man who would only give his name as 'Gordo' because he feared for his safety. He said he had arrived two days earlier after traveling from Copan, Honduras. Gordo said he had lived in Los Angeles for 10 years but had been in Honduras for the past four. He was trying to make it back to California, where he has a 15-year-old daughter. Asked about his prospects for successfully crossing the river, he said: 'It's difficult, not so much for the Border Patrol'. His chief concern being the cartels.","Arrests up 65 per cent on Mexican border with Texas as drug cartels drive lucrative human smuggling trade .

"A New York journalist  famed for his reporting from China wrote that the state-run newspaper China Daily faked an editorial under his byline after interviewing him.

Peter Hessler (pictured) says he didn't write the piece posted on China Daily's website a day earlier titled - US observer: Comparing Egypt with China . China Daily is a state-run newspaper in China . The resulting editorial repeats Communist Party talking points, lauding China's stability and education system while counseling that any changes in China are 'likely to be subtle, incremental, and coming from the top.' After living in Egypt, the editorial reads, 'I think I have a better understanding of how essentially stable the Chinese system is.' The article continues: 'It reminds me that in China, even in a tiny village, there was a great deal of government activity. The villagers were very clearly connected to the larger political systems and issues of the country.' Hessler, however, wrote on Facebook that he was asked mainly about his reflections on the past year and that the piece misrepresented his larger points. 'It omitted crucial parts, including the most important point: that I believe it's harder to make a political change in China, where the system is deeper rooted than in Egypt, and thus the flaws are also more deeply rooted,' Hessler wrote. 'I said that this is the reason why the current anti-corruption campaign will be a failure, because China is not addressing its systemic flaws.' A China Daily editor said Wednesday she didn't have details about the dispute but would make inquiries. The newspaper removed the online piece in English, but it remains available in state media in Chinese. On Facebook, Hessler wrote he asked the China Daily for a retraction but the paper refused. Having worked in China for about a decade until 2007, Hessler wrote extensively about the country, producing four popular books about his experiences there.

"Warning: Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman (pictured) said women should 'beware' of Ukip . Labour's leading feminist has launched a provocative attack on Ukip as a party led by 'Neanderthal sexists'. Deputy leader Harriet Harman said women should 'beware' of Ukip, which tolerated 'appalling' anti-female remarks and offered a policy platform that was 'bad for women'. Some 90 per cent of candidates selected so far by the Eurosceptic party for the General Election are male, as are 81 per cent of its 360 councillors and 71 per cent of MEPs, according to a new Labour analysis. Miss Harman criticised those women Ukip does have in senior roles – such as communities spokeswoman Suzanne Evans – for representing a party that she said wanted to take their sex 'backwards'. Miss Evans, Ukip's deputy chairman, accused Miss Harman of a 'vicious and completely uncalled for outburst' and branded her 'Harpie Harman'. Labour's attack represents its latest attempt to counter the threat from Ukip in many of its northern seats by going after its weakest flank. Mr Farage admitted late last year that his party has a women problem in terms of its appeal to voters, saying that Ukip could at times come across as a bit 'blokeish'. But he compounded the problem by making what was condemned by critics as another sexist comment, asking: 'What do you want me to do? Go sell flowers?' Evidence from polls ahead of the Heywood and Middleton by-election early in October suggested Ukip was ahead of Labour by 41 per cent to 38 per cent among male voters, but trailing with just 21 per cent support from women. Labour went on to take the seat. Miss Harman said: 'Women should beware of Ukip. It's a backwards party run by dinosaurs who clearly expect men to be running the show and women to be obeying them. 'It's clear from their policies and what they say, and what they do that Ukip is bad for women. 'It's not just the Neanderthal sexist comments, and their overwhelmingly male team of candidates -- their policies show no recognition that half the people in this country are women and that women expect, and are entitled, to be treated on equal terms to men. It's a party frozen in time.' Labour cited remarks by Stuart Agnew, an MEP, who claimed women 'don't have the ambition to go right to the top because something gets in the way… it's called a baby'. Former treasurer and party donor Stuart Wheeler questioned the performance of women in business and sport, claiming: 'Chess, bridge, poker – women come absolutely nowhere. I think that has to be borne in mind… it may be that women are not as competitive.' Slammed: Miss Harman criticised senior women in Ukip – such as  Suzanne Evans (right) – for representing a party that she said wanted to take their sex 'backwards'. Left, Ukip leader Nigel Farage . Mr Farage, meanwhile, has said women in the City are worth 'far less to the employer' if they have a child 'and take two or three years off work' and made controversial remarks about 'ostentatious' breastfeeding in public places. Miss Harman also cited Ukip's call for deeper public service cuts, which she said would hit women hardest, and criticised the party's alliance with the EFDD group in the European Parliament. Members include Robert Ivashkievich, from the Polish New Right Party, whose leader until a few weeks ago was Janusz Korwin-Mikke. He has said women 'should not have the right to vote' and claimed that 'when women say no, they don't always mean it'. Comments: Former Ukip treasurer and party donor Stuart Wheeler (pictured) questioned the performance of women in business and sport . Labour's analysis of Ukip Parliamentary candidates shows that 344 of 383 selected candidates are male. A Ukip candidate is more likely to be called 'Dave', 'Steve' or 'John' than be a woman.

If Ukip was sexist, I wouldn't be deputy chairman and handed the huge responsiblity of delivering the general election manifesto. 'We wouldn't have seven female MEPs, all of them selected to stand by our members. And we certainly wouldn't have more frontbench spokeswomen than any other national party. 'Our spokeswomen have gritty roles too - transport and business, for example, not the usual fluffy 'women's issues' roles that other parties have so patronisingly handed out on many occasions. 'Like other women in Ukip, I can be confident I'm doing the job I'm doing because I was chosen to do it on merit, not because of ridiculous and demeaning quotas that mean I tick the right equality box. That's what Labour's policies have reduced women to and it infuriates me. 'They've put women out of work; forced down wages for women because of mass uncontrolled migration, they've raised our taxes, helped make childcare the most expensive in the world, and not properly addressed the issue of women suffering appalling cultural crimes like female genital mutilation.'","Labour's Harriet Harman said Ukip tolerated 'appalling' anti-female remarks .

"A couple who secretly converted a crumbling pigsty into a four-bedroom home have been ordered to move out after losing a battle against planning chiefs. In a bid to outwit planners the  owner's made sure the outhouse looked like any other farm building, made of grey concrete blocks with big sliding doors and no windows. But inside it had four bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and bathroom facilities and flourescent lighting and radiators. Planners say the occupants 'deliberately concealed' the property and the only clues to its use were a letterbox on an entrance gate and a satellite dish on a wall away from the road. In a bid to outwit the planners the owner's of the former pigsty made sure the outhouse looked like any other farm building from the outside . The owners, named on documents as David Younger and his wife Elizabeth, had previously lived in the adjacent farm which they sold in 2008 and then bought the pigsty and other agricultural buildings. The 3,293sq/ft shed, named Heathacre Barns, stands in the middle of the Norfolk Broads surrounded by farmland and waterways. The local Broads Authority said the owners failed to get any planning permission to covert it into a house. They became locked in a dispute with the local authority after they began to investigating in November 2012, when they were refused access to the site. Inside the couple created four bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and bathroom facilities, without securing the necessary planning permission . Planning chiefs became suspicious about the outbuilding and launched an investigation after they were refused access to the site . Four months later the council ordered the owners to get out and return it to its former use. A last ditch attempt to overturn the council's decision failed and they have been told they must move out this weekend. The couple had tried to claim to the government's planning inspector they had obtained planning permission after living in the building for more than four years. However, the rule only applies when concealment is not used. During the two day-hearing the inspectorate heard that the previous owners as a store for 'wood and domestic items'. He also said the barn looked like 'an old utilitarian agricultural building' complete with concrete walls and roof covered with a corrugated material. The report states: 'There was a wide sliding door in the front wall of the building formed from old plywood and a domestic size door set back in a passageway some 2m from the front wall of the building. 'Together with its neighbouring shed, the former pig rearing buildings of Heathacre Barns have a run-down and low-key presence although a few items, which could be described as domestic in nature, such as a gazebo, a carpet, some garden plants and shrubs, and some small solar lights, were visible from the public footbath. After losing their last ditch attempt to keep their home the couple have been ordered to move out and return it to its former state . 'There was also evidence of cars regularly being parked within the site. There was a caravan in a poor state of repair and used to store household and garden items at the rear of the Barn.' It also added that there was 'no natural light' in the building and it was mainly lit by 'striplighting with florescent tubes'. The report also dismisses the couples claims that they had lived in the property for four years after buying the barn in 2005. It was completed by 2008 but the Inspectorate ruled that they did not move into the building when they sold the neighbouring residential property the next year. After the couple move out, the outbuilding will go under the hammer and is expected to fetch between £20,000 and £40,000 at auction . Instead they moved to a house in Loddon, Norfolk, while further work was carried out to make the barn habitable. But the report did add that even if they had lived their for more than four years they would have no grounds of appeal on the basis that they had concealed the barn's use as a residential dwelling from the authorities. Mr Younger told the hearing that he had never been covert about his work at the Barn and had not 'wilfully deceived anybody nor falsified any record to make his case'. As a result of the ruling they have put the pigsty up for auction with a guide price of just £20,000 - and a warning that it cannot be used for residential purposes. They will have to strip out all the furniture and fittings and return the barn to its original state. As the couple deliberately concealed the home, circled in this aerial picture, they were unable to apply for retrospective planning permission . A report by a council planning officer said: 'It should be noted that it is considered that there has also been a deliberate attempt at concealment of this development.' A Broads Authority spokesman said they were made aware of the property after a neighbour reported a 'vermin infestation.' 'Planning regulations apply to everybody to ensure we are all protected from unlawful development. 'This development did not meet building regulations and was first brought to the attention of South Norfolk Council and the Broads Authority because of neighbours' reports of a vermin infestation. 'We realise planning is a complex issue and will always try to work with applicants to help them find solutions to any hurdles. They will have to strip out all the furniture and fittings and return the barn to its original state before it is inspected by council officials at the weekend . 'But in this case a decision made by the planning inspectorate found the couple, who are experienced property developers, 'embarked on a complex, well thought out and interlinked series of actions over time to deliberately conceal their intentions from the Authority, and South Norfolk Council, after they moved out from the guesthouse they owned to the next door piggery.'' The spokesman explained that the couple took the case to the independent planning inspector, who ruled in the authority's favour. 'They have to be out by Saturday and we will be inspecting the building to make sure they have removed the kitchen, bathroom and everything else they put inside. 'It can only be used as an agricultural building, which is why it is only £20,000.' The couple own a second barn on the site in Chedgrave and previously owned a nearby house which they split into two properties and sold on. Until they find a more permanent home they will be renting a room from the neighbours they sold their property to. An enforcement order published by the Broads Authority in 2013 says the local planning authority started investigating the 'former piggery' in November 2012. Robert Hurst, who is due to auction the building, said he did not believe the owners spent a 'huge amount of money' converting it . It says the building has a 'shallow pitched roof and no windows' and that the conversion is 'not of high quality'. The enforcement also referenced a pile of cages outside the building which had been used to house chinchillas. It claimed the owner had advertised the pets on the internet but that they were 'not an agricultural animal' was a 'development which requires planning permission'. Robert Hurst, from Auction House, said the property will go under the hammer with a guide price of £20,000 to £40,000. 'The idea was to try and keep it concealed as a barn and because they converted the inside and didn't change the outside they got away with it for years,' he said. 'They concealed it, so even if they lived there for 20 years you couldn't then get any retrospective permission or anything like that. 'I think they have had held their hands up and admitted they are at fault. 'They have owned it for years because they used to live in the house next door before they bought the barn. 'They have done a lot of the work on the building themselves but I don't think they have spent a fortune on it. 'It doesn't have central heating and it has got electric plug-in heaters. I wouldn't have thought they spent a huge amount of money.' It is being sold at Dunston Hall Hotel in Norwich on February 18 at 11am.

"Baring her breasts and winking at the camera, ‘Nicole from Bournemouth’ today brought to an end speculation that Page 3 had been killed off. It had been widely thought the controversial segment in The Sun newspaper had been dropped after 44 years - and Government ministers welcomed the move. The newspaper had not published pictures of topless glamour models since last Friday, instead advising readers the pictures would be available on its website. Scroll down for video . Topless photos: Among the most famous Page 3 models is Katie Price (pictured), formerly known as Jordan . Stars in the Sun: Ex-Page 3 models Kathy Lloyd (left) and Karen White (right), pictured in the late Nineties . But under the headline ‘Clarifications and Corrections’ on page three today, the paper published a topless photograph of the 22-year-old model. It stated: ‘Further to recent reports in all other media outlets, we would like to clarify that this is Page 3 and this is a picture of Nicole, 22, from Bournemouth. ‘We would like to apologise on behalf of the print and broadcast journalists who have spent the last two days talking and writing about us.’ The No To Page 3 campaign group, which had all but declared victory in their battle to have the feature axed, admitted that its war was not yet won. Black and white days: Other former Page 3 models include Samantha Fox (right) and Linda Lusardi (left) Protest: The No More Page 3 campaign group was founded in August 2012 by actress Lucy-Anne Holmes . A spokesman said on Twitter: ‘So it seems the fight might be back on. Thanks to The Sun newspaper for all the publicity they've given the campaign. See you tomorrow.’ After reports the paper had decided to quietly drop the feature, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Liberal Democrat women's and equalities minister Jo Swinson were among those to express their delight at the apparent change. Despite claims earlier this week in The Times newspaper, owned by Rupert Murdoch who also owns The Sun, that the feature had been dropped, the tabloid had refused to confirm the move. Its head of public relations Dylan Sharpe stated on Twitter last night: ‘I said that it was speculation and not to trust reports by people unconnected to The Sun.’ Pleased: Former Page 3 pin-up turned bodybuilder Jodie Marsh (pictured), 36, said she was 'happy' that the feature had seemingly been reinstated . Said they were pleased: Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Liberal Democrat women's and equalities minister Jo Swinson were among those to express their delight at the apparent end of Page 3 topless photos . Former Page 3 pin-up turned bodybuilder Jodie Marsh, 36, last night said she was ‘happy’ that the feature had seemingly been reinstated. Rupert Murdoch: The News Corp boss signalled last year that he was considering dropping the feature . Writing on Twitter to the No More Page 3 group she said: ‘May I humbly suggest that you now put your time & effort into something that actually matters like campaigning against FGM...’ Page 3 girl Rhian Sugden, 28, said earlier this week: ‘It's only a matter of time before everything we do will be dictated by comfy shoe-wearing, no bra-wearing, man-haters.’ The Page 3 pin-ups were introduced by the Sun in 1970, less than a year after Rupert Murdoch bought the title. But the News Corp boss signalled last year that he was considering dropping the feature. He asked his Twitter followers: ‘Aren't beautiful young women more attractive in at least some fashionable clothes?’ Mr Murdoch went on: ‘Brit feminists bang on forever about Page 3. I bet never buy paper. I think old fashioned but readers seem to disagree.’ Sarah Vine wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday that the demise of Page 3 being celebrated by the likes of Harriet Harman and No More Page 3 movement founder Lucy-Anne Holmes was 'no victory for feminism'. The columnist said: 'Twenty years ago, I might have joined these ladies in their chorus of celebration. But the truth is, in the 21st century it has almost no significance whatsoever.'","Segment in The Sun was believed to have been dropped after 44 years .

"We’ve seen the vampire facial and Botox is old news - so what are women now doing to turn back the clock in their desperate quest for youth? The latest anti-ageing treatment taking the cosmetic industry by storm is the ‘puppet facelift’, which experts claim can help women beat wrinkles without going under the knife. Earning its nickname from the use of strings, or threads, to lift and volumise the cheeks and lower face, the puppet facelift is proving popular with women in their 30s seeking to reduce the first signs of ageing. Former beauty queen, Rachel Howard, 34,   before (left) and after (right), says the procedure has given her a boost in confidence, making her happier and feeling more feminine . Indeed, the non-surgical treatment, which costs £1,650, saw a 1,065 per cent rise in enquiries at the start of the year. The treatment takes an hour or two and involves ‘strings’ being threaded through the face, under the skin to lift the muscles on the face. Speaking about the cosmetic craze, Dr Sarah Tonks at Knightsbridge-based medical spa, Omniya London, said: 'The puppet facelift has been gaining popularity at a rapid rate, particularly with ladies in their 30s - and with good reason. 'Our 30s represent a transitional time, particularly for women. While the skin isn’t sagging enough to warrant a surgical facelift, the signs of ageing have started to set in - particularly around the jaw and cheeks. 'The thread lift can help improve the appearance of skin laxity, giving patients a more volumised look.' Dr Tonks explains that the treatment offers patients a subtle facial lift that looks natural, meaning they avoid the ‘wind tunnel’ look often associated with surgical facelifts. The treatment takes an hour and involves 'strings' being threaded  under the skin to lift facial muscles . Thread lifting is being offered as a way of tightening jawlines and boosting cheek volume . 'It makes  them look refreshed rather than different,' she added. 'No one wants to look like they’ve had work done, especially in their 30s, so this treatment offers the best solution. 'It could be the end of the scalpel - the results are that good.' Former beauty queen, Rachel Howard, 34, who was crowned Miss UK in 2012, underwent a puppet lift last year. She says the procedure has given her a boost in confidence, making her happier and feeling more feminine. 'Like many women my age, I found the transition into my early 30s a distressing time,' she explained. Rachel, 34, before (left) and after (right)  thinks her face looks fresher but not 'overdone' since the procedure . 'Being a former beauty queen, I’m very aware of my looks and ageing, and when I started to see the skin around my eyes becoming lax, making me look like I had eye bags, I decided to approach a professional for help. 'Dr Tonks recommended I try it and it’s changed my life. The idea of the ""puppet lift"" is quite strange to start with, especially when you see the strings poking through the skin. 'But it lifts the muscles and skin making sure the face looks fresher but avoids the ""overdone"" look I associate with plastic surgery and facelifts. 'I look and feel more youthful, and I love that my family and friends keep asking me how I look so fresh, rather than asking me what I’ve had done.' Under local anaesthetic, the threads - made of an extra-strong polymer and inserted with a fine needle at  the hairline around the temples - are  attached at the jowls and the folds that run from the nose to the corner of the mouth. There may be bruising or swelling in the days after the treatment and patients are advised not to smile for a week or so to let the threads settle. The body's scar tissue  keeps the threads in place and results are effective for five to seven years. Former Miss UK Rachel says she looks and feels more youthful thanks to the one-hour treatment . Carole Brennan, meanwhile, is one of the clinic's older clients. The 57-year-old from London underwent the non-surgical facelift after being scared to opt for surgery. 'I came to Dr. Tonks last year when I started to feel gradually more unhappy with the sagging skin on my face and my eye bags,' she said. 'I felt like my face was ageing me, but I didn’t feel a facelift was the right option for me. The idea of scalpels and invasive surgery made me shudder, but  the idea of threads  sounded perfect for me. 'Before the treatment I looked like I was in my 60s or worse, but now I’ve had people say I don’t look a day over 45. 'My confidence has never been higher, and I feel like a new woman - this treatment turned back the clock ten years for me.' Carole Brennan, 57, underwent the non-surgical facelift after being scared to opt for surgery. She says that before the treatment (left) she looked like she was in her 60s but now (right) people say she looks  45 .

"A former beauty queen embroiled in a divorce battle with a Laura Ashley boss has been criticised by a High Court judge for demanding £135,000 a year to spend on holidays. Pauline Chai, who was Miss Malaysia in 1969, has asked for £85,000 a month from her estranged husband Khoo Kay Peng. The figure includes £135,000 a year to cover first-class flights, suites at five-star hotels and chauffeurs. Former beauty queen: Pauline Chai, 67, wanted £130,000 a year for holidays from her estranged husband as part of their divorce battle at the High Court. She is pictured at home in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire . But Mrs Justice Roberts said Miss Chai’s claims were ‘hardly frugal’ and ‘in excess’ of what she was likely to spend. The judge had been asked to decide how much Dr Khoo, 76, the non-executive chairman of Laura Ashley Holdings, should give to Miss Chai to cover her living expenses pending a final decision on their battle over an estimated £200million fortune. Miss Chai, 68, had asked for ‘interim maintenance’ of more than £85,000 a month to cover her ‘needs’, including holidays. Lawyers for Dr Khoo described the budget as ‘staggering’. Mrs Justice Roberts, who analysed arguments on interim payments at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, has concluded that Dr Khoo should pay £50,000 a month. Miss Chai’s lawyers said she had ‘suffered reductions’ since the separation. Couple: Khoo Kay Peng (left) and former Miss Malaysia Pauline Chai, right, were married for 43 years until the union fell apart last year . They said she had stopped physiotherapy treatment, had started to ‘cut and dye’ her own hair, had not been going on holidays and had stopped her ‘expensive’ hobby of renovating doll houses. Mrs Justice Roberts said Miss Chai could not be left ‘high and dry’ or given ‘carte blanche’. But she rejected her claims of a ‘frugal existence’, adding: ‘The wife, in her written evidence, speaks of the measures she has been obliged to take in order to economise in recent months. ‘She says she has had to sell jewellery and borrow from friends. She explains that she can no longer afford trips to her hairdresser in central London but instead has to cut and dye her own hair. ‘Her budget for such expenses is £450 a month, or £5,400 per annum. ‘I am slightly surprised that this economy has had to be made given the sums she is claiming in respect of other living expenses. Argument: Miss Chai says they moved their home to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, before separating last year, and she wants decisions made in an English court . Berkhamsted property: Dr Khoo, who is based in Malaysia, says the marital home was in Malaysia and he wants a judge in Malaysia to make decisions about the division of money . Dr Khoo is non-executive chairman of Laura Ashley Holdings. One of its stores in London is pictured . ‘I am unable to accept the picture which she paints of a somewhat frugal existence. I view the sums claimed as being in excess of what she is likely to spend while she is so deeply enmeshed in this on-going litigation.’ She said she thought payments of £45,000 a month ‘reasonable and fair’. In mid-2013, Miss Chai was given an interim lump sum of £1.85million, said Mrs Justice Roberts. She added that between May 2013 and February 2014, Miss Chai had spent £950,000 on ‘living expenses and outgoings’. In October, Miss Chai told another hearing that she owned 1,000 pairs of shoes. Dr Khoo and Miss Chai both come from Malaysia and have five children. They married in December 1970 and separated after 42 years together. Miss Chai wants to fight the court case in England, while her husband wants the hearings to be held in Malaysia. He says his former wife wants to fight in England because an English court will be more generous.","Pauline Chai, 68, and Khoo Kay Peng, 76, split after 43 years of marriage .

"Public health officials are urging the public to spend short bursts in the sun from April to October to ensure they get enough Vitamin D. NICE, the health watchdog, has issued guidance which says Vitamin D is crucial for protecting the bones, yet figures show that 1 in 6 adults are deficient. The guidelines do not specify how long but previously experts have recommended that 13 minutes between 11am and 3pm in summer would be sufficient. Health watchdog NICE now advises people to go out for short bursts in the sun from April to October, to ensure they get enough Vitamin D for strong bones. One in six adults is deficient in Vitamin D, NICE warns . Professor Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive and director of health and social care at NICE, said: ‘Although exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays for too long can increase your risk of developing skin cancer, being out in the sun can be good for you too – it provides both a good source of vitamin D and the opportunity to be physically active. ‘A balance needs to be struck. This depends on a number of factors including geographical location, time of day and year, weather conditions, natural skin colour and time spent in the sun.” ‘Those likely to be at higher risk of skin cancer include people with lighter skin who may burn more easily, as well as babies and people who work outside. ‘People at higher risk of having low levels of vitamin D, include those with darker skin, pregnant women, children, older adults, and people who don’t get much sun exposure.’ Sarah Williams, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘It’s important to enjoy the sun safely, by striking the right balance between making vitamin D while not increasing the risk of skin cancer. ‘Most people should make enough vitamin D during the UK summer through short, regular exposures to the sun, without getting sunburnt. 'But everyone’s skin reacts differently to the sun, so there isn’t a one size fits all recommendation.’ Conversely, the watchdog is also urging the public to avoid using phrases such as ‘healthy tans’ and ‘escaping to the sun’ as they undermine the dangers of skin cancer. Conversely, NICE is urging people to avoid using phrases such as 'healthy tans' and 'escaping to the sun' as they undermine the dangers of skin cancer. People assume they are fully protected by suncream when this isn't the case, particularly if cream isn't applied to all areas of the skin or washes off after going swimming . It has issued guidance calling for better awareness of the risks posed by spending even short periods in the sun. Officials are particularly worried that adults and teenagers who sunbathe here or abroad assume they are fully protected by suncream. This isn’t the case – the watchdog points out – particularly if cream isn’t applied to all areas of the skin or washes off after going in the pool or sea. Rates of the most deadly form of skin cancer have quadrupled since the 1970s, partly due to the popularity of package holidays and sunbeds. There are 13,300 new cases in the UK every year leading to around 2,100 deaths. The guidance states that adverts or pictures in newspapers and magazine should avoid references to ‘healthy tans’ or ‘escaping to the sun.’","NICE now advises short bursts in the sun between April to October .

"If you struggle to squeeze in daily chores and make time to entertain your friends, life could be about to get much easier. This because the home of the future will be stuffed with time-saving gadgets such as wardrobes that clean your clothes and robotic vacuum cleaners that keep you safe, enabling families to spend more time together and less time doing menial tasks. While mood-changing wallpaper and ‘cyber mirrors’ may sound like they belong in a sci-fi film, such technology has been developed and could be in your home in a matter of years. An infographic created by furniture retailer trueinterior.com shows the array of gadgets that we may see in our living rooms and bedrooms, including floating beds with holograms, self-cleaning wardrobes and hi-tech gadgets to make keep the house clean a breeze (all shown) An infographic created by furniture retailer trueinterior.com shows the array of gadgets we may have to get to grips with in the next few years. We could be sleeping on magnetic smart beds that float in mid-air and there would be no need to change the sheets regularly, because it would include self-sterilisation technology to blitz bacteria. London-based design scientist and futurist Melissa Sterry designed a conceptual bed whose sheets can respond to changes in a sleeper's temperature and could also beam a holographic companion to soothe them to sleep. No more washing clothes? The LG Styler wardrobe (pictured) is fitted with LG's Clothes Care System, designed to refresh clothes without water or detergents using its TrueSteam technology. This consists of hot steam spray technology, which LG uses in washers and dryers, and is said to get rid of 99.9 per cent of the germs and bacteria . The design is based on the results of a study carried out by The Sleep Council, which found that 47 per cent of people would like clean, bacteria-proof sheets. Homeowners will also hang their clothes in a wardrobe, which will clean clothes stored in it, meaning no more separating whites and colours and laboriously hanging clothes up. This technology is already here and was shown off at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week. Made by LG, the wardrobe is fitted with the South Korean firm’s Clothes Care System, designed to refresh clothes without water or detergents using its TrueSteam technology. This consists of hot steam spray technology, which LG uses in washers and dryers, and is said to get rid of 99.9 per cent of the germs and bacteria. By way of bedroom entertainment, screens placed above the bed could let dreamers gaze at stars and systems could monitor their health while they sleep. London-based design scientist and futurist Melissa Sterry designed a conceptual bed whose sheets can respond to changes in a sleeper's temperature and could also beam a holographic companion to soothe them to sleep. The design is based on the results of a study carried out by The Sleep Council, which found that 47 per cent of people would like clean, bacteria-proof sheets . Interactive holograms of parents could be used in children’s' rooms so they are always around to read a bedtime story, for example, while smart windows in bedrooms mean that homeowners could wake up to any view they like every morning. In the house of the future, there will be no need to wait an eternity to get a hot shower or bath, and you could keep up to date with the news while brushing your teeth. A futuristic 'Arc' shower could recycle warm water, while the pressure and temperature would be controlled using a touchscreen on the arc-shaped appliance. Similarly, smart baths will allow workers to run a bath on their way home via a smartphone app. A warming feature will ensure the water never goes cold and a self-clean function means that the days of back-breaking scrubbing will soon be over. Bathroom mirrors may replaced with cyber equivalents that double as TVs and show the news and social media feeds as people brush their teeth. Life is about to get easier for struggling cooks, because the Inspiro Oven uses sensors to work out what will be cooked and set the temperature and time required to cook a dish perfectly. Electrolux’s oven has unconventional settings so users can choose a category, such as 'roast' and then set whether they want their meat rate, medium or well done, instead of working out the time and setting the temperature. The LG Styler wardrobe (pictured) is part of a range of household appliances and gadgets unveiled by the South Korean firm . The LG Styler wardrobe is part of a range of household appliances and gadgets unveiled by the South Korean firm. It is fitted with LG's Clothes Care System, designed to refresh clothes without water or detergents using its TrueSteam technology. This consists of hot steam spray technology, which LG uses in washers and dryers, and is said to get rid of 99.9 per cent of the germs and bacteria. Tests carried out by Intertek found the LG Styler also eliminates approximately 92 per cent of Perchloroethylene - a chemical left on clothes after dry cleaning. A Quick Refresh button keeps clothes smelling fresh, while Moving Hanger Action gently shakes steamed items to remove everyday wrinkles. There is also an Easy Pants Crease Care feature, which refreshes and irons trousers with a ‘perfect crease’ in half an hour. The LG Styler additionally features a built-in heat pump. This generates and maintains warm air at a low temperature to keep clothing from shrinking or being damaged while drying. Plus, the Odor Removal feature uses steam to help remove smells left behind by smoke, food and sweat, and depending on individual tastes, users can choose between two different aroma sheets. In homes of the future, people will unroll their TVs and possibly control them by blinking. LG has already unveiled a roll-up 18 inch Ultra HD TV, which uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow it to be turned into a scroll.The flexible OLED panel has a high-definition class resolution of 1200 X 810 with almost 1 million mega-pixels and can be rolled up to a radius of 3cm without affecting the function of the display . A water-free dishwashing cupboard, which currently a concept, would not only save space in the kitchen, but put an end to the tedium of washing up as well as unloading a conventional dishwasher. It would use carbon monoxide to remove traces of food and grime from plates and cutlery. An energy-saving fridge filled with gel could be used to preserve food. Russian designer Yuriy Dmitriev came up with the idea for the Bio Robot Refrigerator. His concept suggests that shoppers could simply place their sealed groceries into the cavern of odourless and non-sticky gel to keep it cool without even having to open a door. And they could make coffee and other drinks remotely, using a smartphone, while robotic bar tenders, which have already been invented, could prove a hi-tech alternative. A Wi-Fi Coffee Machine by British firm Smarter will go on sale in March for £129 and will make coffee from scratch, grinding the beans and boiling water using set recipes that can be tweaked to suit the owner’s taste. The machine can be controlled by an app and work with a range of other devices, such as smartbands and watches too. The Wi-Fi Coffee Machine by Smarter (left) can be triggered, via a smartphone, to not only make you a hot drink tailored to your individual taste but have it ready for you before you even wake up. As well as smart drinks machines, homes of the future may have fridges full of gel to keep food cool and fresh. A conceptual image is shown right . With no need to vacuum thanks to robotic vacuum cleaners, which are already on the market, homeowners will have more time to spend with their families and friends. A dining pod could take the headache out of dinner parties, because it unfurls like a flower complete with mood lighting for an evening, before folding away the next day. Afterwards, a tired host could relax on a magnetic floating sofa and watch a roll-up TV by changing channel at the flick of an eyelid. LG unveiled a roll-up 18 inch Ultra HD TV in July, which uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow it to be turned into a scroll. The flexible OLED panel has a high-definition class resolution of 1200 X 810 with almost 1 million mega-pixels and can be rolled up to a radius of 3cm without affecting the function of the display. Meanwhile, a Chinese brand called Haier has built a TV controlled by a person's eyes. The prototype uses an eye tracking unit so a user can control an on-screen cursor just by looking at it and blink to select an option. Wallpaper will also change colour and pattern to suit a person’s mood. With so many smart devices that are connected to the internet in the home of the future, owners will need a gadget to control them easily. The company behind a 'smart home automation system' called NEEO is seeking investment on Kickstarter for its technology, claiming that it's 'the simplest way to connect and control all devices in your home'. A Californian company has created the Neeo remote control (pictured) that can be used to control smart appliances in the home, with the help of a 'brain' unit. The remote will recognise a user's hand when they pick it up to select the correct profile and display favourites and playlists for audio gadgets, for example . It comprises a cylindrical 'brain' that communicates with various smart appliances, and a remote control, enabling a home owner to control them. The brain will have a database of more than 30,000 devices that it could connect to and control, including support for Apple TV, Roku and Philips Hue lights, as well as being able to work with all major AV products produced in the last 10 years. The rechargeable aluminium remote will recognise a user's hand when they pick it up to select the correct profile and display favourites and  playlists for audio gadgets, for example. Homeowners will also be able to use an app, if they are not nearby the remote control. The two gadgets together are available to pre-order for $199 on Kickstarter.

Fun for the family: Fox's ice rink measures 20 x 40 feet and is a hit with children . '2 x 10s and then 2 x 8s hold in everything together,' he explained in an interview with the affiliate station. 'And then it's basically one big tarp you put all that on and then fill up with water and then let it freeze.' WGN reported that there is foam around the 20 x 40 foot rink's wall, rubber mats for entering and exiting - plus overhead lights hanging outside. 'We got lights up in the trees and one over there in the swing set, and yeah, so the kids come out here after school and they skate all they want,' Fox told the affiliate station.

'Zamboni': This homemade device helps resurface the ice on Tom Fox's backyard rink . The father revealed his homemade 'Zamboni' meant to smooth the ice in the rink, telling WGN that the 'Zamboni is a nice little feature.' Fox explained 'It's basically a garbage can, and then I plumbed it up with PVC pipe and filled it up with warm water, and just drag it around the rink and it resurfaces it.' Speaking about the ice rink, Fox also said 'It already actually drained once, so it's a little hole. We tried to fill it up before Christmas and there was a hole in the liner and it all drained out so it never froze, so then the day after Christmas I filled it back up. 'I haven't seen the water bill,' he continued while laughing. 'Don't want to see the water bill.' Six-year-old Sydney, meanwhile, told WGN that her favorite thing while using her ice skates is to 'Play hockey with my dad.'

"Officials in Newtown voted Wednesday night to tear down the home where Adam Lanza lived before he carried out the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The vote by the Newtown Legislative Council approved a proposal by the board of selectmen to raze the 3,100-square-foot home and keep the land as open space. First Selectwoman Pat Llodra said she expects the Lanza house will be razed once winter is over. The 2-acre property was given to the town in December by a bank that acquired it from the Lanza family. Scroll down for video . Residence: Officials in Newtown voted Wednesday night to tear down the home where Adam Lanza lived before he carried out the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School (2012 file photo) Neighbors had been pleading with town officials to tear down the house of the mass murderer, with one resident saying it's 'a constant reminder of the evil that resided there.' Inside the large yellow house with green shutters on Yogananda Street is where Lanza shot his mother to death Dec. 14, 2012, before killing 20 first-graders and six educators at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School. He then committed suicide. Amy DeLoughy, whose house sits across the street, wrote to the council that her children's bus stop had to be moved because it was too scary for the kids to wait near the house. Shooter: Inside the large yellow house with green shutters on Yogananda Street is where Adam Lanza, pictured shot his mother to death before killing 20 first-graders and six educators at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School. He then committed suicide. Ian and Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son, Dylan, died in the shooting, have said they moved out of the neighborhood because seeing that house across the way was too painful for them. Neighbor Dave Ackart wrote, 'Not only is the property a constant reminder of the evil that resided there — those of us who walk, run, drive, ride or otherwise must pass it multiple times a day, are having a hard time moving on.' Llodra was unsure how much demolition would cost, but estimated it could be around $27,000. Legislative Council member Phillip Carroll said a Sandy Hook fundraiser that brought in $1.2 million still has about $260,000 left. 'The money for the demolition can come from this fund,' he said. Llodra has asked town attorneys to write something into the deed that will prohibit the town from profiting from any future sale or development of the land. 'Any proceeds, should the property ever be developed, would be for the benefit of the victims,' she said. The Lanza family moved from southern New Hampshire and bought the new house in 1998. It has been sitting vacant since the shooting. Everything inside, including rugs and lighting fixtures, have been removed and incinerated so nothing could become memorabilia. But neighbors say it has become a destination for macabre tourists 'who still drive by and pause and take photos on a regular basis,' Ackart wrote. Llodra said she polled the victims' families and neighbors, and most support the plan to tear the house down. But not everyone likes the idea of leaving the space open. DeLoughy said she would rather the property be sold and a new home built on the property. 'Leaving the property to nature would mean there is still a sense of darkness in our neighborhood,' she said. 'Love and light that a new family would bring would help heal some of the very deep wounds we are still tending to.'","Officials in Newtown voted Wednesday night to tear down the home where Adam Lanza lived before he carried out the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School .

"Over 1,000 people have been left homeless after a massive fire ripped through a 400-unit luxury apartment complex in New Jersey starting Wednesday evening. Authorities said everyone in the four-story building—where a two-bedroom with views of Manhattan would set you back around $3,000 per month—was able to flee to safety. The fire gutted 240 of the 408 units. Now authorities in Edgewater must piece together how the five-alarm blaze began in very spot where, 14 years prior, a similar 5-story complex under construction was totally destroyed along with several neighboring homes. Scroll down for video . Blaze: Part of the New York City skyline peers through smoke rising at an apartment complex the morning after flames engulfed the building in Edgewater, New Jersey . Homeless: Over 1,000 residents are now effectively homeless following the blaze, which broke out in the city with sweeping Manhattan views around 4;30opm Wednesday . Gutted: Firefighters continued to douse the smoldering ashes as the sun rose early Thursday morning. The fire gutted 240 of the 408 units . Desperate: Everyone escaped to safety from the 400-unit building but now many residents must scramble to find new homes . State of emergency: Edgewater Mayor Michael McPartland declared a local state of emergency. He said schools would be closed on Thursday and access to roads would be restricted until further notice. Hampered by winds and frigid temperatures, firefighters battled the huge fire Wednesday night at the Avalon apartment complex, home to New York Yankees announcer John Sterling and a thousand others. The enormous fire sent flames sky high and left smoke still visible from Manhattan in the early hours of Thursday. Residents in parts of New York City could not only see the thick smoke coming from across the Hudson, but they could smell it, as well. Residents were ordered to evacuate and many were sheltered at a nearby school. As the fire continued to rage, hundreds who lived at the complex wondered what would be left of their homes. By morning, the true extent of the disaster was revealed as smoke billowed from the once gleaming complex's ashes. 'I was wondering what I was going to do for clothes,' Sterling said in an interview with the New York Daily News. 'But then I started thinking about all the stuff, all the memories, whether it be music, books, and a lot of other stuff. 'You know I was planning on moving to a new apartment complex and felt I was going to throw a lot of that stuff out. Now I hope I haven't lost it.'

Plumes of thick, black smoke issued from the blaze and residents in Manhattan and the rest of New Jersey were still overcome with the smell of the fire on Thursday morning. Edgewater Mayor Michael McPartland declared a local state of emergency, according to NJ.com. He said schools would be closed on Thursday and access to roads would be restricted until further notice. 160 people are being sheltered at a local community center but he said he was just relieved there had been no loss of life. 'To have no loss of life and so many people displaced, we actually feel fortunate and thankful,' he said. 'Everyone got out…You can always rebuild.' Hours after the fire started, the entire building was engulfed in flames, The Bergen Record reported.

"Danika France, 18, broke into a bedroom while friend Leah Trevena, 19, was in there with a man following a night out and filmed her . A teenager posted a revenge porn film on Facebook of her best friend having sex, a court was told yesterday. Danika France filmed Leah Trevena without her consent while she was in bed with a man following a night out. When Miss Trevena protested, 18-year-old France promised she would delete the video. But a month later the pair fell out and France posted the 15-second film on her own Facebook page. Miss Trevena, a 19-year-old college student, reported her to police, saying she felt ‘hurt, humiliated and suicidal’. ‘I felt my stomach drop and I felt sick,’ she told officers. ‘Since that day I have felt awful and have not stopped crying.’ The incident happened in October after the pair had been out together in Newcastle. They met two men and later went back to their digs where France took the sex footage with her mobile phone. Debbie Byrne, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendant opened the bedroom door and filmed her friend in bed with a man. ‘The video shows that she was laughing as Leah was protesting. 'Leah didn’t give permission to be filmed and asked the defendant to immediately delete the video.’ France failed to do so and soon their friendship fell apart to the extent that she told Miss Trevena to ‘jump off a bridge and do everyone a favour’. Later she sent the video to a friend, Charles Hall, asking him to put a screen shot online. The 21-year-old did so on November 14, with the comment: ‘I’ve got the video if anyone else wants it.’ Three days later, France posted the video in full on Facebook. Defence lawyer John Gallagher, said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of why I hate social media. For someone of Miss France’s age it is what they are brought up with. 'They don’t think about the consequences of some of their actions.’ The incident occurred last October after the pair had been out together in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. But just one month later the pair fell out and a friend posted a screenshot of the illicit film to Miss Trevena's Facebook page. France herself then posted the video in full onto her own Facebook page . Leah Trevena from Macclesfield, Cheshire, said she was upset at the lenient sentence her former friend has been given . France, of Macclesfield, Cheshire, admitted an offence under the Malicious Communications Act. Magistrates in the town yesterday imposed a 12-month community order with an order to wear an electronic tag. She must pay Miss Trevena £100 in compensation. France, who is on benefits after losing her job as a carer, also admitted a separate offence of assaulting a girl during a night out. For this she was given a 7pm to 7am curfew and told to pay a further £210 in costs. Magistrates said it was a 'very serious matter' but said France (pictured outside court) pleaded guilty at the first opportunity . The court heard Miss Trevena began to distance herself from France over the incident and the pair fell out over a rumour circulating amongst their friendship group . France (right) who is currently on benefits also admitted an unrelated offence of an assault by beating on another girl during a night out in Macclesfield . Magistrates in Macclesfield heard how France told Miss Trevena (both pictured) to 'jump off a bridge and do everyone a favour . Hall, of Bollington, Cheshire, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to posting the screen shot. He was given a three-month curfew with £145 in costs. A spokesman from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘No one should have to suffer the hurt and humiliation of revenge pornography. ‘Prosecutors are being asked specifically to consider the impact on the victims involved.’ A specific offence relating to the crime is being discussed by Parliament. Following the case Miss Trevena said: ‘I’m pretty disappointed at the sentence. She has already posted messages on social media saying she is celebrating because she isn’t going to jail.’","Danika France, 18, broke into room while Leah Trevena, 19, was having sex .

"A 'treatment tax' should be imposed on alcohol bought in shops to turn round soaring levels of drink-related hospital admissions, a think tank close to Iain Duncan Smith has said. The Centre for Social Justice said wine, beer and spirits bought in off-licenses and supermarkets should be subject to a levy of a penny per unit to fund rehabilitation for alcoholics. It would mean that a the price of bottle of wine, which contains around 10 units, would rise by 10p. A pack of four beers would rise by a similar amount - with pints of low-strength beer going up by 2p. The Centre for Social Justice said wine, beer and spirits bought in off-licenses and supermarkets should be subject to a levy of a penny per unit to fund rehabilitation for alcoholics . The think tank, which was set up by the Work and Pensions Secretary before the election, said action was needed because the number of alcohol-related hospital admissions have risen to more than 1.2million a year. New figures reveal that admissions in England rose by more than 5 per cent over the space of two years. But critics will question why ordinary responsible drinkers should be hit in their pockets to fund treatment for the irresponsible. Christian Guy, the director of the CSJ, said: 'Alcohol abuse can rip into families, make communities less safe and entrench poverty. 'This is a growing problem but for years effective treatment has been the preserve of the wealthy. It's time to break this injustice wide open and fund a new generation of rehabilitation treatment.' The CSJ said the figures show alcohol abuse is an increasing burden on society and public services – and called for a new 'treatment tax' to be levied on off-licence sales to fund rehab. The think tank - which is close to Iain Duncan Smith - said there had been a surge in alcohol-related hospital admissions . Data shows the number of admissions rose from 1,168,266 in 2010/11 to 1,232,464 in 2012/13, the latest statistics from the Department for Health highlight. Analysis from the CSJ has found that, going on recent trends, the number of cases could reach as much as 1.5 million by the time of the election. Public spending cuts since the election mean that residential treatment – the most effective form of 'rehab' treatment – has suffered from reductions in spending. The think tank said these cuts should be reversed, and said the 'treatment tax' would be an effective way to afford this. The levy would be added to off-licence alcohol sales to fund rehab for people with alcohol and drug addictions. Under the scheme, a tax of a penny per unit would be added by the end of the next Parliament to fund recovery services to the tune of £1.1billion over five years. The CSJ was also critical of a lack of prosecutions of individuals serving alcohol to people who are drunk. There were only 29 convictions in England over the five years from 2009 to 2013. In the last recorded year there were five. The think tank called for Police and Crime Commissioners to put more resources into cracking down on those who sell alcohol to drunks. Around 1.6million people are estimated to be dependent on alcohol in England and one in five children live with a parent who drinks hazardously. Every year alcohol is said to cost society £21billion. The CSJ said that as much as 70 per cent of accident and emergency visits in the early hours are alcohol related, and 40 per cent of A&E attendances at weekends are caused by alcohol.","New proposal for 1p per unit surcharge to fund rehabilitation for alcoholics .

"With her perfectly coiffed locks, smart, tailored dresses and Mulberry handbags, Kim Sears always look immaculately stylish when she watches fiance Andy Murray play at Wimbledon. But the 26-year-old showcased a more dressed-down look when she watched him win his second round match against Marinko Matosevic on day three of the Australian Open. The artist from Surrey looked casual in a cropped T-shirt with the slogan 'I Shih Tzu Not' yesterday. Scroll down for video . Casual Kim: She wore shorts and a T-shirt with the slogan 'I Shih Tzu Not' on day three of the Australian Open . Budget buy: The dog-themed T-shirt is £16 from online retailer ASOS . The fiancee of Andy Murray still showed their wealth with a £895 Bayswater Mulberry on her arm . Sparkler: Her diamond engagement ring is estimated to be worth £200,000 . She teamed her Tee, which is available from ASOS for £16, with white shorts and flat roman sandals. Given the temperatures in Australia at this time of year can rise to 40 degrees, it's not surprising that Kim, who is expected to marry Andy in October, opted for cool, summery clothing. But it's a far cry from her usual look when she takes to the family box at Wimbledon to watch Andy, 27, play. Wimbledon winner: Kim wore this £925 dress by Victoria Beckham when Andy won the tournament in 2013 . The designer dress was worn as pictures of Kim were beamed around the world after Andy's historic victory . High end High Street: On day one of Wimbledon 2014, Kim this white lace sleeved Reiss 'Jennifer' dress, £225 . Designer day: Kim wore this pink fitted £440 dress from Goat, Burberry wedges and a £1395 Aspinal Marylebone tote bag to the Wimbledon quarter finals in 2014 . On those occasions, she has chosen to wear a number of fitted, pretty dresses from a mix of High Street and designer stores. She's often accessorised with a belt to cinch in her waist and worn heels or Burberry wedges to elongate her figure. Her favourite High Street retailers include the more expensively priced Hobbs, Ted Baker, Zara and Reiss - stores also favoured by another English style icon, the Duchess of Cambridge. Kim's most expensive outfit worn to Wimbledon was a mint, £925 crochet dress by Victoria Beckham which she wore when Andy won the grand slam in 2013. Smart: For the Wimbledon final in 2012 she looked like she could be headed to the office in this high-waisted skirt, white blouse, wedges and Mulberry Bayswater bag . Pretty print dresses: At the fourth round of Wimbledon 2013 in a £49.99 Zara dress, left, and a £129 swallow print dress from Hobbs at the 2014 tournament, right . On the seventh day of Wimbledon 2014 in a pink leopard dress by Whistles and her Aspinal tote . At the final the year before, when the outcome had been quite different for Andy as he lost to Roger Federer, she had dressed smartly in a fitted high-waisted skirt and white blouse with leopard print wedges. She's never without her collection of designer handbags as she either has her £895 Bayswater Mulberry, £1,500 Mulberry Willow Tote or £1,100.00 Mulberry Alexa on her arm. At Wimbledon last year, she was rarely seen without her Aspinal Marylebone tote bag - which costs an eye-watering £1395. The tailored looks contrast to Kim's more laidback appearance down under yesterday - perhaps chosen as she feels she isn't as much in the lime light when her fiance isn't playing in front of a home crowd. Bright and breezy on day three of Wimbledon 2013 in a yellow dress by Ted Baker . Another dress from Hobbs, the £129 'Ada' worn to the Wimbledon semi finals in 2013 . Her outfit still had a hint of glamour thanks to her carrying her Bayswater Mulberry and dazzling engagement ring, thought to be worth £200,000. Kim shared a picture of her T-shirt on her Instragram account with the caption: 'My current clothing obsession #shihtzu #asos.' She usually uses the account to show off her own drawings of dogs as she works part-time doing pet portraits. At Wimbledon 2012, she wore this long sleeve navy dress with co-coordinating belt and Mulberry bag .","Kim looked casual in 'I Shih Tzu Not' T-shirt from ASOS and shorts .

"At just two-years-old, a California boy called Tegan has made a name for himself online thanks to a series on videos showing him busting out some incredible dub step dance moves. But the clips have also raised some eyebrows as to whether they are authentic, amid questions they may have been doctored to seem more impressive than they are. Not so, says the creators of the YouTube videos, one of whom is Lino Morin, the father of Tegan and a dancer himself. Sensation: California toddler Tegan has developed a large online following, but are the moves his own? Busting out: Despite some questions over Tegan's dancing, the creators of the video said they are authentic . Tegan, of Grass Velley, in northeast of Sacramento, appears in more than 10 of the group's videos, which are filmed around their neighborhood. His father and another man, Vincent Pezzi, are the other two dancers. They perform under the name ProFlo. The first video of Tegan appeared online on October 3. 'Anyone (doesn't believe they are real) can just look on YouTube,'  Pezzi told The Daily Mail Online. 'We have alot more videos. There's one titled Prodigy and others where we dance as a group.' Pezzi invited any skeptics to come along and watch the trio dance. A video uploaded in December then hit back at what appeared to be detractors who called out some of the moves as fake. 'No Photoshop. We Do This,' was the title of one video, which showed Tegan dancing in the rain. Tegan dances alongside his father in many of the clips. Like father, like son: Lino Morin (right), a dancer and the father of Tegan, appears in many videos with his son . Tegan's most popular clip features him dancing to to Adventure Club's remix of 'Crave You' by Flight Facilities. That video has been viewed near four million times. It was filmed dancing outside his home in northern California. Calls for comment to reach the creators of ProFlo by The Daily Mail were not immediately returned.

"Digna Love, 34, was arrested and charged with child neglect and driving under the influence accompanied by a person under 18 . A pregnant Florida woman dropping her five-year-old daughter at school was arrested and charged for driving under the influence after police found she was four times over the legal limit. Digna Love, 34, was pulled over in a parking lot in Jupiter, Florida, at around 8.15am on November 5 by police responding to a report of reckless driving. The police said that Love's eyes were glassy, her speech was slurred and her breath smelt of alcohol. Love took a volunteer blood alcohol test and police said the samples showed levels of .363 and .360. Florida's legal driving limit is .08. She was charged with child neglect and driving under the influence accompanied by a person under 18, according to CBS 12. Love, who told officials she was six weeks pregnant, said that she had started drinking before leaving her house because she was 'unhappy.' The incident comes just weeks after a video of a Florida man showing step-by-step instructions on how to avoid a DUI arrest went viral and outraged viewers. The video posted on New Year's Day, one of the most dangerous days for drunk driving, showed a Levy County, Florida man preparing to enter a DUI checkpoint by putting his license, insurance and a flyer in a plastic bag. The flyer detailed the driver's rights and read: 'I remain silent, no searches, I want my lawyer'. As the man pulled up to the DUI checkpoint, an officer read the flyer and sent the driver on his way. Love was pulled over in a parking lot and police said she had glassy eyes, slurred speech and the smell of alcohol on her breath .","Digna Love was dropping her daughter at school when she was pulled over .

"A female veteran found a nasty note  left on her car criticizing her for parking in a spot reserved for veterans outside of a grocery store in North Carolina. Mary Claire Caine, who served in the Air Force and spent time stationed in Kuwait, found the note attached to the front passenger window of her SUV outside the Harris Teeter grocery store in Wilmington, North Carolina. The note, written in sharpie, read: ‘Maybe [you] can’t read the sign you parked in front of. This space is reserved for those who fought for AMERICA… not you. Thanks, Wounded Vet.’ As a veteran Caine could not believe what she had read. Scroll down for video . Mary Claire Caine (pictured) served in the Air Force for four years as an avionics technician at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. As a veteran she is entitled to use reserved parking spots at her local grocery store . She returned to her car after a routine trip to the Harris Teeter store in Wilmington, North Carolina, to find a note criticizing her use of the reserved veterans' parking spot signed simply 'Wounded Vet' ‘The first thing I felt was confusion that there was a mistake, and that I had to talk to this person and ask them why they were so quick to assume I wasn't a veteran and that I was taking privileges that didn't belong to me,’ she told WECT. Her confusion turned to anger when she found herself questioning her eligibility to use the special parking spots, marked: ‘Reserved Veteran Parking’. ‘For a split second I thought, “Am I a worthy enough veteran to park in this spot?” And, then I got very angry at myself for even considering that.’ She waited by the car in the hope that the note’s author would return and she could set the record straight and correct their apparent hurtful conclusion that as a woman she was unlikely to be a veteran. Caine waited by the car in the hope that the note's author would appear and she could confront them about the assumption that she was not a veteran. Unfortunately they did not return . ‘I think they took one look at me when I got out of my car and saw that I was a woman and assumed I wasn't a veteran and assumed I hadn't served my country.’ ‘They have this image of what today's American veteran is and honestly if you've served in the United States military, you know that veterans come in all shapes and sizes. I question whether the person who left the note was fully aware of that.’ Caine served from as an avionics technician at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, from 1996 to 2000, where she worked on the on the flight line of the F-117 Nighthawk. She comes from a military family, her father was a Vietnam era Marine Corps officer, and both of her brothers also joined the marines. Caine enlisted in the Air Force at the age of 21. After a four-year tour she left the Air Force as a senior airman. Caine then moved to North Carolina, earned a college degree, and became a realtor. Caine comes from a military family, having followed both her father and her brothers into service. 'Veterans come in all shapes and sizes. I question whether the person who left the note was fully aware of that' she said . Caine suspects that the note’s author partly jumped to the conclusion they did because her realtor contact details are prominently displayed on the back of the SUV she drives. She also speculated that perhaps the person who wrote the note assumed the special parking spots were only for wounded veterans, even though the signs do not say that. ‘I want them to know they owe me and every other female service member who's fighting now and who's fought in the past, an apology for jumping to conclusions,’ Caine told WECT. ‘It's true what the soldiers missing in action slogan is: “All gave some and some gave all.” And, I think that's very important that sacrifice is sacrifice and I earned the title as a veteran and I'm proud of that.’ Caine speculates that the display of contact details for her current career as a realtor on the back of her car, pictured here outside the Harris Teeter grocery store where the incident occurred, may be partially to blame . Caine, does not always park in the veteran spots, and only makes a point of doing so when her 10-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter are with her, though on the day in question she was alone. Both of her children are proud of their mother for serving in the military. Harris Teeter grocery chain spokesperson Danna Jones said in a statement: 'Harris Teeter shoppers write, call, tweet and post to us that they love these spaces, and we were disappointed to learn what occurred with Ms. Caine.' 'Our teams are in the process of reaching out to Ms. Caine, so we can offer her a token of our appreciation as well as thank her for her service and for shopping at Harris Teeter.' Caine has said that she while appreciates people offering her gifts, she would prefer if people instead consider donating to the Wounded Warrior Project.","Mary Claire Caine served for four years in the Air Force but returned to her car to find a note criticizing her use of a veterans-only parking spot .

"Four of celebrity chef Marco Pierre White’s pubs have gone into administration as accounts reveal he is owed more than £1 million. Disgruntled staff have spoken out claiming suppliers have been let down and bills are unpaid, and administrators have confirmed they have been appointed as a result of the ‘businesses experiencing short term cash flow problems’. The Wayford Bridge Inn and the Acle Bridge Inn on the Norfolk Broads and the Chequers Inn and The Lifeboat Inn in Thornham, Norfolk are set to be sold off. For sale: Marco Pierre White's Wayford Bridge Inn on the Norfolk Broads went into administration on Monday . Chequers Inn: The chef's pub in Thornham will be sold off after the business experienced 'short-term cash flow problems' Restructuring specialists Zolfo Cooper confirmed today that the four pubs went into administration on Monday. The pubs are part of Horatio Inns Limited, which owns just the four venues, and Mr White is listed as one of the directors of on Companies House website. The most recent set of accounts on Companies House reveals the chef is owed more than £1 million, although it is not known whether this outstanding balance has since been settled. A Zolfo Cooper spokeswoman said: ‘The administrators were appointed as a result of the businesses experiencing short term cash flow problems arising from the recent challenging economic environment.’ She said trade will continue at the restaurants, adding: ‘The venues are very popular and have a healthy number of existing bookings which the administrators fully intend to honour.’ Nick Cropper, a partner in restructuring services at Zolfo Cooper, said: ‘We believe the businesses are attractive to a range of potential buyers and we welcome expressions of interest from third parties to acquire any or all of the sites. ‘We would also like to thank the staff for their continued support and professionalism during this process.’ An employee at another of his venues, the Carnarvon Arms in Highclere, Berkshire, which is the former coach house to neighbouring Highclere Castle, better known as TV’s Downton Abbey, said it was up for sale. Trade continues: The Acle Bridge Inn on the Norfolk Broads will remain open and administrators intend to honour existing bookings . A member of staff at the Lifeboat Inn in Thornham said: 'The bills have not been paid for ages, there are a lot of local suppliers who have been let down' The worker at Carnarvon Arms said staff have known the restaurant has been up for sale since October, but they were only told officially in January. Since then, they say furniture and fittings, including sofas and curtains, have been taken from the venue. Zolfo Cooper is not dealing with with the Carnarvon Arms. A member of staff at the Lifeboat Inn, who asked not be named, said: ‘We had no warning, the administrators just walked in on Monday. ‘Everything has been transferred over to the administrators, they are dealing with everything now. ‘Marco had quite a big role in the business but I think he knew something was wrong. ‘The bills have not been paid for ages, there are a lot of local suppliers who have been let down. ‘We have all been told that we are safe and that the administrators are dealing with everything and that they will keep the business running.’ Celebrity chef: One of Mr White's gastro-pubs was sold last year amid reports it was boycotted by locals . The pubs are part of Pierre White’s Wheeler’s of St James’s group. Workers at the Frogmill in Cheltenham, Gloustershire and the Rudloe Arms in Wiltshire - part of the group - said as far as they were aware they are not closing. It has not been possible to contact The Horse & Groom near Malmesbury in Wiltshire and the Black Boy Inn at Milton near Banbury, Oxfordshire. Craig Clark, 20, worked as a restaurant supervisor during the majority of Mr White’s tenure at The Angel pub in Lavenham, Suffolk. It was bought from the Hell’s Kitchen chef in November last year. He said: ‘This isn’t part of the Marco Pierre White group anymore. ‘I have also been told that the Carnarvon Arms is going up for sale, the Wayford Bridge Inn is being stripped and The Lifeboat is heading that way too.' Last year, Mr White sold one of his gastro-pubs amid reports it was boycotted by locals and subject to a mass staff walkout. The celebrity chef bought the Pear Tree Inn in Whitley, Wiltshire in 2011, but quickly came under fire from locals for charging high prices and apparently converting it into a posh London-style eatery. Downton: An employee at Mr White's Carnarvon Arms in Highclere, Berkshire, which is the former coach house to neighbouring Highclere Castle, better known as TV’s Downton Abbey, said it was also up for sale . In August, it was also claimed that just a single manager was left at the gastro-pub after a ‘mass walkout’ by ‘frustrated’ staff who were fed up with White’s allegedly ‘bossy’ management style. Mr White owns a string of steakhouse and Italian restaurants and pubs, and was dubbed the first ‘celebrity chef’. He has trained top chefs including Gordon Ramsay and was the youngest person to be awarded three Michelin stars. In November, it was announced Mr White’s colourful journey from a council estate in Leeds is to be made into a Hollywood film by the British film director and producer Sir Ridley Scott. The chef sold the rights to his bestselling autobiography, The Devil In The Kitchen, to Sir Scott, whose films include Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Blade Runner and Thelma And Louise.

"These errie pictures show how a once-magnificent  orphanage backed by stars of the silver screen has been left to rot for a decade after plans to turn into a clinic for paedophiles were blocked by the local community. Grade Two listed  Silverlands was once an orphanage home to 60 destitute children and supported by the likes of Noel Coward, Sir Laurence Olivier and Richard Attenborough. The ornate chandeliers that hangs precariously from the ceilings and the mahogany panelling now are the only hints of the house's former grandeur. Despite,its glamours past the property in Chertsey, Surrey, now has boarded up windows and mould growing on the walls, as nature threatens to reclaim it. A chandelier still hangs over the impressive oak staircase and landing inside Silverlands in Chertsey, Surrey, that has been left to rot . 'I wanted to photograph an abandoned orphanage because of the idea behind it,' said online blogger Stacey Louise, 21, who explored the abandoned property with her partner Tim Barber, 31. 'I liked the fact that the place children were left at has now been left itself - almost as if the building has become an orphan. The Neo-Georgian entrance hall has survived the years of neglect and the staircase leads to what were once the bedrooms of the orphans house there . 'A place that once was filled with children and some happy times now alone and lost, hidden from people and forgotten.' Silverlands was originally built in 1814 by Surrey brewer Robert Porter, before being largely rebuilt by its second owner Vice Admiral Sir Henry Hotham. The three storey home was extended by its third owner Sir John Brunner, who lived here between 1907-8 and 1919, and was believed to have added the grand Neo-Georgian panelled entrance lobby and library. It became home to the Actors Orphanage in 1938, who aimed to board, clothe and educate destitute children of actors and actresses. The Fund's first President was the eminent actor, Sir Henry Irving. Two years later the children were evacuated to New York following the outbreak of World War II. The orphans, thanks to Noel Coward, were sent to the Edwin Gould Foundation in New York, where they stayed for the entire conflict. Rubble now litters the floor of the once the grand dinning room at Silverlands that was believed to have hosted the likes of Noel Coward and Sir Laurence Olivier . IN 1945, the Actors Orphanage Fund returned to Silverlands after the Germans surrendered to Allied forces. In the early 1940s a nursing school was also established at the site to train staff for nearby hospitals. In 1956 Laurence Olivier took over as president of the Fund and Richard Attenborough served as his deputy. Together the pair introduced many changes at the home. They instigated changes, including the old dormitories being partitioned into individual cubicles each furnished with a new bed, small bureau and mirror. The children were divided into 'family groups' each containing a mixture of boys and girls of different ages and placed under the supervision of house parents. Each group had its own sitting room and dining room. The children were also allowed to choose some of their own clothes, listen to pop music, and hold or attend Saturday night dances. The Ministry of Justice had planned to turn Silverlands into a clinic for paedophiles in the late nineties, but were forced to abandon their plans following opposition from local people . In 1958 facing rising repair costs the orphanage closed its doors, but the nursing school remained until the 1990s. The site lay empty until the late nineties when the Ministry of Justice announced plans to turn it into a clinic for paedophiles and sex offenders. The proposal was met by strong opposition from the local community and the proposals were eventually abandoned in 2002 after a series of candle light vigils. A decaying toilet inside the former orphanage that was home to up to 60 children for 20 years, between 1938 and 1958 . Silverlands has been left to rot ever since. The entrance hall to Silverlands, dates back to the early 20th Century and is in a Neo-Georgian style, with full height panelling . Despite years of neglect the elaborate early 20th Century Neo-Georgian entrance hall, with fall height panelling, remains, as does the main stair case, which features carved oak balustrades. One ground floor rooms has an Adam-style plastered ceiling and columns dating back to around 1845, another has early 20th Century dado panelling, doorcase. A thick layer of dust covers the stone floors, capets and every surface inside the building which has been left to rot . 'I tried to visit the abandoned orphanage a couple of years ago and ended up being chased out by security guards and the police,' said Mr Barber, who captured the images in the middle of the night. 'Going back was always on the cards, this place has always been on the 'to do' list because of what it was and what it once had meant to so many people and families. The walls inside one of the gathering rooms have started to crumble after years of neglect. Mould appears to be growing on the walls of this hall. Photographer Tim Barber said: 'To me, these pictures capture a time that has been long forgotten.' 'What was particularly astonishing was the centrepiece of the building where the huge grand oak staircase stood with beautiful ornate chandeliers hanging over it. 'The inside was very grand and, in its day, would have been very impressive. 'To me, these pictures capture a time that has been long forgotten. Staff quarters: An internal staircase inside the grand orphanage. Photographer Stacey Louise said the 'building has become an orphan' The main corridor inside Silverlands that was once walked by children and staff who lived in the orphanage in Chertsey, Surrey . 'The people who walked the corridors and stairs have long since left and nature has started to consume what is left of the building. 'I see a place whose purpose has become void and now is destined to be forgotten by the world.' Silverlands has been left rotting ever since. 1814 - The original large country house was built by local brewer Robert Porter. 1820 - Silverlands was rebuilt by Vice-Admiral Sir Frederick Hotham and Silverlands was the Hotham family home until around 1887. 1896 - The Actors' Orphanage was started by Kittie Carson at Croydon and was established as the Actors' Orphanage Fund in 1912. 1915 - The orphanage moved to Langley Hall, Berkshire, and in 1934, Noël Coward became President of the charity . 1938 - The charity moved its orphanage to Silverlands in Chertsey, Surrey. 1940 - The children living in the home were evacuated to the Edwin Gould Foundation in New York, USA. 1941 - Some of the buildings became a female nurse’s school for the nearby Botley Park Asylum and St Peter’s Hospital. 1945 - The children returned to Silverlands after the end of World War II. The orphanage ran alongside the nures's school. 1956 - Sir Laurence Olivier took over as President of the charity with Richard Attenborough as his Deputy. 1958 - The cost of major repairs needed to the building, the declining numbers of children at the home resulted in a decision to close Silverlands as an orphanage. 1990 - Silverlands Nursing School amalgamated with other schools of nursing to become the Francis Harrison College of nursing and midwifery. Late nineties - The probation service was looking at taking over Silverlands as a clinic for paedophiles.The proposals were met by strong opposition from local people who organised a candle lit vigil in protest. 2002 - The Ministry of Justice announced that Silverlands was no longer being  considered for the clinic.","Silverlands was built as a large country house in 1849 by local brewer Robert Porter in Chertsey, Surrey .

"An ancient carnivorous reptile with teeth shaped like steak knives has been named. Nundasuchus roamed the Earth 240 million years ago and had bony plates on its back like a crocodile, with legs underneath its body like a dinosaur. The skeleton, which has taken more than 1,000 hours to reconstruct, may help experts to fill in gaps in the ancient reptile family tree. What a find! Palaeontologists have discovered an ancient carnivorous reptile with teeth shaped like steak knives. Nundasuchus roamed the Earth 240 million years ago and was heavy-bodied with limbs under its body like a dinosaur. An illustration of the 9 ft (3 metre) reptile is shown . The nine foot (three-metre) reptile was one of the larger reptiles that lived before dinosaurs roamed the planet. ‘The full name is actually Nundasuchus songeaensis,' Sterling Nesbitt, an assistant professor of geological sciences at Virginia Tech explained. The name means ‘predator crocodile’ with ‘unda’ meaning predator in Swahili and ‘suchus’ a reference to a crocodile in Greek. A distant relative? The ancient reptile had bony plates on its back like a crocodile (a stock image is shown) with legs underneath its body like a dinosaur. Its name means ‘predator crocodile’ with ‘unda’ meaning predator in Swahili and ‘suchus’ a reference to a crocodile in Greek . Name: Nundasuchus songeaensis . Meaning: Predator crocodile, with 'unda' meaning predator in Swahili and 'suchus' a reference to a crocodile in Greece. The later part comes from the town, Songea, where the bones were found. Age: The reptile lived 140 million years ago . Distinctive features: It had bony plates on its back like a crocodile, with legs underneath its body like a dinosaur, as well as teeth that have been likened to steak knives. Skeleton location: It was found in Songea, south west Tanzania. Importance: The bones may help experts to fill in gaps in the ancient reptile family tree. 'The ""songeaensis"" comes from the town, Songea, near where we found the bones,' Professor Nesbitt said. ‘The reptile itself was heavy-bodied with limbs under its body like a dinosaur, or bird, but with bony plates on its back like a crocodilian.’ The 32-year-old academic has discovered seven reptiles and dinosaurs in the past decade, and was involved in naming 17. He discovered the partial skeleton in 2007 when he was a student but it has taken years to piece the bones together, which were in thousands of pieces. While a large number of skeleton bones were found, most of the skull was not recovered. Nundasuchus was discovered close to a town in southwestern Tanzania while Professor Nesbitt and a team of researchers were looking for prehistoric relatives of birds and crocodiles. ‘There's such a huge gap in our understanding around the time when the common ancestor of birds and crocodilians was alive - there isn't a lot out there in the fossil record from that part of the reptile family tree,’ he said. ‘This helps us fill in some gaps in reptile family tree, but we're still studying it and figuring out the implications.’ Nundasuchus was found  while Professor Nesbitt (pictured) and a team of researchers were looking for prehistoric relatives of birds and crocodiles. Here, he collects bones at the site . The bones were collected in Songea, southwestern Tanzania (shown on the map) in 2007. Its skeleton was found in thousands of pieces and took more than 1,000 hours to reconstruct . Professor Nesbitt said that he realised very quickly what he had found. ‘Sometimes you know instantly if it's new and within about 30 seconds of picking up this bone I knew it was a new species. ‘I had hoped to find a leg bone to identify it, and I thought, “this is exactly why we're here” and I looked down and there were bones everywhere. ‘It turns out I was standing on bones that had been weathering out of the rock for hundreds of years - and it was all one individual of a new species.’ The reptile was recorded in the Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology. Prehistoric crocodiles were able to run around like dogs to escape the jaws of predatory dinosaurs. This is according to a study published last year that showed, for the first time, how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world. Today, most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish, but their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales. Today, most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish. But their ancestors (pictuerd) were very different creatures, with some running around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales . The study, by Bristol University, revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments. The team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the Mesozoic - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years. The study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the Jurassic seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey, such as fish. Sample of jaws from the Mesozoic crocodile record . The research also found that variation peaked again in the Cretaceous period- 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food. The research also found that variation peaked again in the Cretaceous period- 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food. After the devastating end-Triassic extinction event, crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish. They also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the Cretaceous Period - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs, including eating plants. Surprisingly, the lower jaws of Cretaceous crocodiles did not have a huge amount of variation. Instead, the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy, such as armadillo-like body armour.","Nundasuchus songeaensis had bony plates on its back like a crocodile .

"Fuel bills will soar as green targets leave Britain reliant on expensive imported gas, the energy regulator warned yesterday. Alistair Buchanan, chief executive of Ofgem, also raised the spectre of 1970s-style blackouts because 10 per cent of coal and oil-fired power production is being shut down next month. The chance of large power cuts – those that hit more than a million homes – will be 300 times more likely by 2015, he warned. 'Rollercoaster': Ofgem chief Alistair Buchanan issued a stark warning to consumers and businesses to prepare for higher prices as power plants close, foreign gas supplies shrink and demand increases . He claimed ministers were banking on low-carbon energy from nuclear power and wind farms which do not yet provide enough power to keep the lights on. Mr Buchanan said: ‘We have to face the likelihood that avoiding power shortages will also carry a price. 'If you can imagine a ride on a rollercoaster at a fairground, then this winter we are at the top of the circuit and we head downhill – fast.’ An average dual fuel bill is now more than £1,300 a year, a 160 per cent rise on 2004, leaving more families in fuel poverty and choosing between heating and eating. The Ofgem chief, who will retire this year, told an audience in central London that attempts by the Government to reform the electricity market had come too late to avert price hikes. Outlook: With coal and oil-fired power stations closing earlier than expected to meet environmental targets, about 10 per cent of current generation stock goes next month (file picture) There had been a ‘car crash’ when the Labour government’s huge investment in renewables and decision to phase out coal met the financial crash, he said. From 2015 he predicted a ‘double squeeze’ on both supplies and prices as suppliers scramble to invest in new resources. Mr Buchanan said the financial crisis is largely to blame for the squeeze on energy supplies, making companies less keen to invest in costly new nuclear plants and renewable technology. Coal and oil supply 30 per cent of Britain’s power but an EU directive means older power plants must install expensive technology to reduce emissions or shut down by 2015. It has now emerged that one in ten will close early, at the end of March, and more could follow. Mr Buchanan also blamed UK green taxes – a new carbon tax on industry comes in from April – as well as global trends in coal and gas prices. Going up: This graph shows fuel price indices in the domestic sector in real terms from 1990 to 2011. The prices paid by domestic customers for all fuel and light rose by 8 per cent in real terms from 2010 to 2011 . The Ofgem chief said the amount of electricity coming from gas – currently 41 per cent – will have to rise to over 70 per cent within seven years. But planned new gas power stations have not even been built and many are closing due to rising costs. Spare power in the system to cope with sudden spikes in demand such as a freezing winter has dropped from 14 per cent to below 5 per cent. ‘That is uncomfortably tight’, he said. Firms will ‘have to go shopping around the world’ for costly imported gas which is also in demand in Asia and across Europe, where all nations must cut emissions. ‘The big worry about gas for all consumers is what price will we have to pay to get it?’, he said. ‘Because just when we need more gas, world demand for gas is set to rise while our own supplies are predicted to fall.’ Ann Robinson of uSwitch said customers could not take a bigger squeeze on bills. She added: ‘The Government needs to pause and consider the impact large scale investment is having on consumers and the affordability of energy. We need some renewables but maybe not as many as people say. ‘We are investing in onshore and offshore wind, 40 new gas power stations in case the wind doesn’t blow and we are going to have to pay to compensate them if they don’t run all the time. This needs thinking through again.’ Keeping warm: The Government said it was acting to prevent any possible 'looming energy gap' (file picture) A new generation of eight nuclear power stations is planned but they will not produce energy until the 2020s. Drax switches to wood chips.jpg . Plans . trumpeted by energy secretary Ed Davey to ‘capture’ emissions from coal . power stations to stop them being released into the atmosphere are also . at a very early stage. Fracking for shale gas has ‘exciting’ potential but is also at least five years off, he said. The risk of power cuts for more than a million homes, as seen during the three-day week crisis in the 1970s, is currently put at 1 in 3,300. But it could drop to one in 12 by 2015, Ofgem said. Jeremy Nicholson, of the manufacturers association EEF, confirmed there was a real risk of blackouts in two years. He added: ‘Even before that our members will experience very high peak prices for electricity, possibly gas prices too, which will could see companies have to temporarily or God forbid permanently stop production when they are trying to be engines of economic growth.’ A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: ‘We cannot afford to be complacent and may face a looming energy gap. ‘The reforms we are introducing to the electricity market are aimed at plugging this gap in order to keep the lights on ... guard against blackouts and ensure there is sufficient supply when margins get right.’","Ofgem chief executive Alistair Buchanan issues big warning to consumers .

"Police have not opened a kidnapping investigation into Robert Allenby's case despite his claims, while authorities also have a surveillance video of a man on a $10,000 spending spree with Allenby's stolen credit card in Waikiki, Hawaii. 9 News reported on Thursday that Hawaii News Now investigative reporter Keoki Kerr said police have not opened a kidnapping investigation, only a robbery case and an unauthorised use of credit card case. However, he said that police believed there was not even sufficient evidence to pursue the robbery case. ‘The investigation is still ongoing but we have opened a robbery and fraudulent theft and credit card investigation. That is all,’ Michelle Yu of the Honolulu Police Department told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Kerr claimed that the same man was also caught on surveillance camera going around stores using Allenby's credit cards to buy more than $10,000 worth of merchandise. Scroll down for video . Toa Kaili claims that he found Robert Allenby passed out on the pavement before he and a friend woke the golfer who accused them of stealing his wallet and phone . Allenby says he can't recall two and a half hours after he was abducted, robbed and dumped in a park . 'The one thing police are certain of is that somebody was using his credit cards and wasn't authorised to do so. That's why they're pursuing that credit card case,' Mr Kerr said. He also said authorities did not believe Allenby's wounds were consistent with an assault, and that it looked like a scrape suffered from a fall. Mr Kerr made it clear that kidnapping is very rare in Hawaii as it has a very low violent crime rate, and that kidnapping usually involves people who know each other. 'It's usually a husband and wife, a girlfriend and boyfriend, or a drug dealer and someone who owes him money,' he explained to 9 News. 'It almost never happens in the case of someone who is just trying to steal some money, credit cards or an iPhone from a tourist. That would be a lot of effort to go through.' Mr Kerr reiterated that there was still no evidence that Mr Allenby was lying, but that 'there's a healthy scepticism about parts of his story'. Since the Australian golfer claimed he was knocked unconscious, placed in a boot and dumped 10km from his hotel after missing the cut at the Sony Open on Saturday, holes have appeared in his story. In yet another twist to the mystery, a homeless man has also come forward claiming he knows where Robert Allenby was for the two and a half hours that the golfer says he can't recall following his alleged abduction. Toa Kaili says he stumbled across the pro golfer passed out on a sidewalk in Waikiki, in Hawaii, at 11pm on Saturday and when he and his friend tried to help Allenby he accused them of stealing his wallet and phone. About two hours later, Mr Kaili says he returned  to find the golfer still unconscious on the pavement but now with a bloodied face – the man claims the Australian was injured from falling over and hitting his head on a rock. 'Then he’s accusing me and my friend 'you guys stole my wallet and phone – alright the gig is up just hand it over' so I was like 'brother we are the ones who woke you up - we are the ones just helping you,' Mr Kaili told Channel 9 News. 'He was saying 'you don’t know who I am'.' Although Mr Kaili denies stealing Allenby's possessions - someone has been having a fine time with the golfer's credit card. Honolulu detectives are following the spending spree on Robert Allenby's stolen credit card, as they try to solve the mystery surrounding his alleged abduction last week. Investigators have also been door-knocking businesses throughout the city for video surveillance footage that might help them piece together what happened to the Australian golfer on the night he was bashed and robbed. The new witness says when he returned two hours later Allenby was still unconscious but with a bloodied face from hitting his head on a rock and accused them again of robbing his possessions . Four days have passed since Robert Allenby's attack. As yet local police have made no arrests and are still seeking more surveillance video to help with their investigation. Authorities believe the spending spree on his stolen credit card is their best chance of an arrest . Robert Allenby is disputing reports regarding conflicting details provided by a female witness to the aftermath of his alleged kidnapping, robbery and bashing on Saturday morning. He said the injuries he suffered are proof . An emotional reunion. Robert Allenby meets the homeless woman, now identified as Charade Keane, at the park in Honolulu where she came to his aid at the weekend . 'Thank you for looking after me,' Allenby said to Ms Keane when they were reunited . 'It’s such a shame that people are focusing on whether the story is true,' Robert Allenby is believed to have said in text messages to the Golf Channel. 'I say you only have to look at me to see the truth.' 'Detectives are reviewing witness statements and gathering security video footage,' Yu said. 'They are also looking into recent charges made on Mr Allenby’s credit card. No arrest has been made.' But other CCTV is being sought from the strip around the wine bar where Allenby was last seen. 'The (extra) video will be very helpful,' Honolulu Police Department Captain Rade Vanic said. Staff at the wine bar in which Allenby, 43, was last seen at about 11pm on Friday said 'we can't say anything about that', when contacted by Daily Mail Australia and asked if they had seen anything untoward on the night. With varying stories from Allenby and Charade Keane, the woman who helped the dazed and bruised Australian in the early hours on Saturday morning, detectives are trying to reconstruct the incident. They are believed to be already in possession of vision which shows Allenby leaving the Amuse Wine Bar at about 11pm on the Friday, with two, as yet unidentified men, and a woman. And more CCTV footage of two men buying alcohol, apparently with the golfer's credit card, has been taken from a store at Waikiki. Ms Keane 'dragged' Allenby to safety as he was arguing with two men in the park telling him 'you have to leave or they will kill you' The spot where Allenby was found 'dazed and confused'. 'Honolulu Police say 'we do have video from various retail establishments, so we are looking into it' The Amuse Wine Bar in Honolulu where Allenby was dining with friends before being bashed and robbed . The Amuse Wine Bar is inside the Honolulu Design Centre. It's where Allenby and friends were before the golfer was beaten and robbed . Robert Allenby missed the cut at the Sony Golf Open in Honolulu . Allenby said he couldn't remember much in the hours after being assaulted and robbed. Capt Vanic said not only were detectives attempting to find more surveillance footage of what Allenby described as a Hollywood-style attack and kidnapping, but they were now seeking video from stores where the culprits might have used his stolen credit cards. Police said they could publicly release video of suspects in the hope of identifying the thieves. 'We do have video from various retail establishments, so we are looking into it,' Capt Vanic said. 'Of course, if it does show individuals who are possible suspects, we will do our best to identify them and may even put it out with our Crime Stoppers information. 'But it is still very early on in our investigation.' Capt Vanic said Keane gave police a statement and they would interview her again if needed. Allenby was drinking with friends at the upmarket Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Friday night and believed he was drugged, bashed in the face with a fist or baseball bat, tossed in the boot of a car, robbed and then dumped in a park 10 kilometres away. The drama began when Allenby was separated from his friends in the bar, caddie Mick Middlemo and Anthony Puntoriero. An image of the intersection where Charade Keane found Robert Allenby slumped in the gutter, bashed and trying to fend off two men . Australian golfer Robert Allenby was bloodied and bruised and without his wallet and phone before being placed in a taxi back to the Kahala Hotel by two good Samaritans, an ex-military officer and Charade Keane . The confusion over what happened to Robert Allenby includes his belief that he was found two and a half hours after he left his friends and some 10 kilometres away from where he was dining and Charade Keane's claim that it was just 50 metres from the Amuse Wine Bar . 'I didn't think I was going to survive this one,' Allenby said. 'I was separated from my friend in the bar after we had paid the tab at 10:48pm and he went to the bathroom and next thing you know I'm being dumped in a park miles away. 'I only know this part because a homeless woman found me and told me she saw a few guys pull up and throw me out of the car. 'That is where I got the scrapes above my eye, from the side-walk.' The homeless woman he referred to is believed to be Ms Keane, who said she found and helped Allenby a short distance away from the bar, perhaps 50 metres down the road, at about 1.30am - some two and a half hours after he disappeared. Bizarrely Allenby had an emotional reunion with the homeless woman, just hours after he accused her of being paid to spread false stories about what happened that night. Allenby, whose face was badly cut and bruised, announced on Tuesday he would not play in this week's PGA Humana Challenge event in La Quinta, California, on the advice of his doctor. 'This will enable me to ensure I am fully recovered prior to rejoining the PGA Tour,' he added . The golfer embraced and kissed Ms Keane, as they greeted each other back at the spot where she said they first met, across the road from the Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Saturday morning. 'I really appreciate what you did,' Allenby told her. The reunion came a few hours after the multi-millionaire pro-golfer reportedly speculated in text messages to Golf Central that Keane was was 'getting paid' to relay details of the incident to the media.","Hawaii News reports says police haven't opened kidnapping investigation .

"A group of tourists who ran up the 'Rocky' steps in Philadelphia got a knockout photo at the top - a selfie with Rocky himself. Peter Rowe said he and two friends had just finished racing up the staircase at the Philadelphia Museum of Art on Saturday when they saw Sylvester Stallone. 'He said to us, ""Man, you guys are fast. You're making me look bad!""' Rowe said. Peter Rowe (right) takes a selfie with friends Jacob Kerstan (left) Andrew Wright (third from left) and actor Sylvester Stallone on the famous 'Rocky' steps in Philadelphia . Stallone then posed for a selfie with the trio, putting up one fist. 'Look tough, guys!' he said, according to Rowe. Stallone made the art museum's steps famous in his first turn as fictional boxer Rocky Balboa, who used them as part of his training regimen. Thousands of people now visit the steps each year to re-create the run and to take pictures with a Rocky statue, which originally was a prop in 'Rocky III.' Rowe's friends, Jacob Kerstan and Andrew Wright, were visiting him from Azusa Pacific University in greater Los Angeles. Rowe recently graduated from the university and moved to the Lancaster area, about 60 miles west of Philadelphia. Yet in all the time spent in L.A., Rowe said, they never saw a famous person. 'What are the chances of meeting him, that celebrity, right there?' he said of the Stallone encounter, calling it 'an unreal experience.' Stallone is in Philadelphia for the shooting of 'Creed,' the latest installment in the series. It stars Michael B. Jordan, who appeared in 'Fruitvale Station,' as the grandson of early Rocky foe Apollo Creed. A representative handling casting for the Stallone movie did not immediately reply to a message asking about the photo on Tuesday.

"Melonie Joyce Martin, 44,  faces prison time after allegedly biting another basketball coach in the eye and nose . A female high school basketball from Georgia faces prison time after allegedly biting another coach in the eye and nose. Melonie Joyce Martin, 44, who heads up the South Cobb Eagles girls team, reportedly got into a profanity-laced argument with Tyrone Harris of Campbell High School on January 9. According to her arrest warrant, an assistant principal and two other coaches watched on as she threw a chair at Harris and threatened to burst his 'grill' while they came head-to-head. 'I’m about to beat your [expletive] and stomp you, and I’ll beat your [expletive] and knock your teeth out of your face,' Martin allegedly said. Authorities say the confrontation happened inside a school office after the South Cobb girls team lost to Campbell High School. Police issued an arrest warrant for Martin on January 13 and charged her with simple battery, a felony, misdemeanor and terroristic threats. She was released from jail after around seven hours on a $7,500 bail. It is unknown if she will be back on the court sidelines for an upcoming game next Tuesday. S. Carlton Rouse, Martin's attorney, tells WSB-TV that she denies touching Harris and never threatened his safety. He added that Martin intends to vigorously fight the charges. '[She] will continue to do what is in her power to protect her clean reputation for excellence in the classroom and in athletic programs within the school.'

"A building society illegally ramped up interest rates for thousands of its buy-to-let customers on a ‘whim’ to boost its coffers, a court heard yesterday. West Bromwich Building Society is accused of ripping off landlords with tracker mortgages by increasing their rates by two percentage points without warning. Tracker mortgages are supposed to follow the Bank of England’s base rate, which has remained at an historic low of 0.5 per cent for almost six years. West Bromwich Building Societyhave been taken to High Court (pictured) accused of illegally ramping up interest rates for thousands of its buy-to-let customers . But the building society shocked customers when they ramped up their rates in December 2013, pushing some from 1.99 per cent above the base rate to 3.99 per cent. Customers were told their rate had been hiked because of ‘market conditions’ and to ensure it was running its business ‘prudently efficiently and competitively’. But property investor Mark Robert Alexander, who took out a mortgage with West Bromwich in 2008, objected and has now taken the case to the High Court on behalf of 350 other disgruntled landlords. The changes are believed to have affected 6,200 customers, but the outcome of the court case could have implications for tens of thousands of buy-to-let landlords on similar contracts with other lenders. Mr Alexander said their tracker rates should be protected under the terms of their mortgage agreement. But the building society said they were able to override these ‘personalised’ terms and activate their standard mortgage offer conditions which, they claim, granted them the right to vary a tracker rate if they felt it was necessary. West Bromwich Building Society is accused of ripping off landlords with tracker mortgages by increasing their rates by two percentage points without warning . An avalanche of complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service followed and 356 of the building society’s customers, including Mr Alexander, formed the Property 118 action group and commenced legal proceedings. Yesterday, Mark Smith, representing the claimants, told Mr Justice Teare that the building society’s actions were unfair and that the clauses in the mortgage contracts used to justify the rate hikes are ‘inconsistent’. The court heard that when Mr Alexander, an investor with a string of buy-to-let properties, entered into the mortgage, he believed it was a fixed rate of 6.29 per cent for four years, followed by a tracker at base rate plus 1.99 per cent until the end of the mortgage term. He was shocked when he received the letter telling him the 1.99 per cent rate would go up to 3.99 per cent and outraged when they referred him to a clause in their standard mortgage conditions, stating any unfixed mortgage rate ‘may be varied by (us) at any time’, in a similar way to a standard variable rate. Mr Smith said the so-called standard terms now relied upon by the building society had been merely ‘grafted on’ to the personal terms of the offers, and should not now be allowed to carry more legal weight. Outside court, Mr Smith warned that if the building society won the case, it could give them the green flag to do the same to residential mortgages. Mark Smith, representing the claimants, warned: ‘They are saying they can just move the rate to make themselves solvent, and residential mortgages will be next.’ But the building society said consumers were not subject to the same terms and conditions and insisted this would not happen. The West Bromwich claimed it had only used its discretion to vary the tracker rate for customers who own a portfolio of three or more buy-to-let properties. Raymond Cox QC, for the building society, defended the decision to up the rate for Mr Alexander, 47, and his wife Svetlana, 41, plus thousands of others. He said the building society’s right to vary the interest rate ‘was repeatedly made clear in the documents sent to Mr Alexander’. The barrister also said the move had been reviewed by the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) which had so far backed the building society in every complaint from the action group. He insisted that the claimants are not trapped in their mortgages, as they have the option to pay their loans off early at any time, with one month’s notice . ‘The mortgage could be terminated early either by the claimant or the defendant... if the claimant did not like the margin as varied,’ he said. But he confirmed outside court that millions of others could potentially endure similar ‘whimsical’ rate increases from their own providers should the West Bromwich win the case. Mr Cox said after the hearing: ‘If we win our case then, going forward, if people have tracker mortgages under the same terms, then other mortgage providers could do the same as us.’ The court heard that the interest rate hike has now been reduced from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent. The hearing continues.","Building society illegally ramped up rates for buy-to-let customers .

"She's the poker-faced fashion designer who intrigued and fascinated the world. And then Victoria Beckham took part in Vogue.com's 73 Questions series where she gave us a flavour of the quick-witted personality her friends know and love. Posing in an all-white outfit from her collection, Victoria welcomes the Vogue team into her pristine Dover Street store and reveals 73 things about herself, including her favourite drink, best fashion secret and why she never smiles. And now, a comedian has gone and created a spoof of the former Spice Girl's short film - and it's bound to make even Victoria crack a smile. Comedian Holly Burn has recreated a spoof version of Victoria Beckham's Vogue 73 questions video . Dressed in a similar outfit to the star - although probably a much cheaper version - actress and writer Holly Burn invites the camera into a corner shop and begins her tongue-in-cheek video. The video opens with her striding through the corner shop - and she has Victoria's mannerisms down to a T. She then greets the corner shop owner in the exact same tone of voice as Victoria does in hers. In the Vogue video, the first question is: 'What's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?,' to which the 40-year-old responds: 'I check on my kids.' In her video, however, Holly responds: 'I have a Poptart.' During Victoria's interview, she led the Vogue team around her Mayfair store wearing a chic white coat . Holly, meanwhile, shows her camera team around a corner shop, greeting the store's unimpressed owner . While Victoria goes on to reveal that she works out at 6am daily, sunset orange is her favourite colour and 12 Years A Slave is the film that makes her cry the most, Holly cites water as her favourite flavour, nik nak crisps as her preferred spice and see-through as her most cherished colour. Victoria used the Vogue video as a chance to show off her flagship store, pointing out her favourite pieces as she struts through, as well as debuting her new sunglasses range. Holly, meanwhile, chooses a Gillette shaving foam as her 'favourite item' in the store and showcases the shop's latest cheese offerings. When asked what superpower she would have, she responds: 'I would like to be able to count again'. When asked the final question, she simply storms out of the shop without replying. She made the film with producer and writer, Amy Dallmeyer. During the interview with Vogue Victoria shows off her favourite new pieces from her collection . Holly selects a shaving foam as her top pick from her corner store in the spoof video . The actress has the fashion designer's mannerisms down to a T and even has a near-similar outfit . Victoria was the latest in a long line of celebrities to be asked Vogue's 73 Questions. The questions change depending on the celebrity and the location of the shoot is always specific to the person. When Sarah Jessica Parker took part in the interview they spoke to her at her New York home while Blake Lively's interview involved making cupcakes as she's a keen baker. Victoria, who seems to be floating around her shop in the film, is asked what her worst question to be asked is and says it is, 'Why don't you ever smile'. Amused? Victoria even tweeted a link to Holly's video with a smirking emoji . She then jokes that she's smiling on the inside and the reason she never breaks into a grin is because: 'I feel that I have a responsibility to the fashion community.' Victoria opened her first store in September having launched her fashion empire in 2008. Since then the business has gone from strength to strength. It has previously been reported that following the success of her UK store Victoria has hopes to open stores in America and Japan.

"Rising Australian star Nick Kyrgios may be through to the third round of the Australian Open - but he's attracting the ire of fans after what many perceived to be arrogance in his post-match interview on Wednesday night. Kyrgios, 19, made several cheeky if not snippy remarks after defeating 'giant' Croatian Ivo Karlovic in five tough sets at Melbourne Park - and many took to social media to express their disappointment. Some even compared Kyrgios to fellow Australian tennis player Bernard Tomic, who has a reputation for his diva antics. He was particularly criticised for what some perceived as a sarcastic remark during his on-court interview when he was asked about being pushed into a final set. ‘Yeah that’s usually what happens when you lose a fourth set, you go into the fifth one,' he fired back. Scroll down for video . Nick Kyrgios paid tribute to his late grandmother when he triumphed over Ivo Karlovic in their round two clash .

Kyrgios is through to round three after toppling 'the giant' Ivo Karlovic who is the tallest player in the comp at 208 centimetres . When asked about the loud shirt his father always wears to matches, Kyrgios was quick to shoot his supportive father down. 'Yeah, Dad’s got his lucky shirt on, I don’t know why he does that, I mean I’m not big on karma or superstition so I don’t know why he does that,' he said, without a trace of a smile. Many took to social media to comment on his demeanour. 'What is it with young aussie tennis players being arrogant smart arses,' tweeted Adrian Gissara.\ . '‏Tomic and Kyrgios need to grow up you're not superstars yet.' Dannielle agreed, tweeting: 'Kyrgios seems so much cockier and arrogant this year at the #AusOpen .

Nice guy: Kyrgios takes to Twitter with a heartfelt thank you for their messages of support throughout, promising to read every single one of their tweets . However, many defended his behaviour, saying that he was just misunderstood. Nick Kyrgrios showed a more down-to-earth and appreciative side when he took to Social Media to interact with his supporters. 'So many great messages, I can't like and comment back to all but I read EVERY SINGLE ONE of them, thank you. #NoWords #Pumped,' he wrote . An hour after Kyrgios' success, the second half of the Super Ks Thanasi Kokkinakis, 18, was knocked out of the tournament – losing to fellow Aussie, World. No. 75 Sam Groth. Groth, 27, is championed for having the world's fastest serve. Tomic also had success against 22nd seed Philipp Kohlschreiber. Unseeded Tomic came from behind after losing the first set to the German, taking out match after four sets. It will be another All-Australian competition when Groth and Tomic face off in Round Three.

Sam Groth was overcome with emotion, wiping tears from his eyes as he claimed victory in the fifth set . 19-year-old Kyrgios secured his win over 35-year-old Karlovic in four swift sets. Karlovic is the ATP tour's tallest ever player at 208cm, whilst Kyrgios is only 193 centimetres tall. Yet despite towering over the young Aussie, Karlovic was only able to steal one set off the home-grown hero. The brightly-dressed teen is just one win away from facing off against second seeded Roger Federer in round four. The Swiss has won the Australian Open four times. Meanwhile, 27-year-old Sam Groth from Narrendera NSW was the stronger competitor, winning the five-set playoff against a clearly-disappointed Kokkinakis. The two Aussies had two sets apiece when Groth grabbed the win 6-1 in a blitzing final set. ‘The crowd was split but they were definitely fair on both of us,’ Groth said after winning the All-Aussie playoff. ‘It’s probably the best atmosphere I’ve ever played in, and I’d say I’m at career-best form.’ Contrarily, Kyrgios claimed victory swiftly and without the dramas that riddled his round one clash against Argentina’s Federico Delbonis. He kept his cool, whereas round one was marked by an on-court tantrum that ended in smashed tennis racquet. Kyrgios played without any discomfort, after he was given treatment for back pain in round one. Speaking at a post-match conference, he said he enjoyed the atmosphere from the crowd, who supported him with great enthusiasm. The Australian contingency of the crowd were torn watching the match between two home-grown heroes . Nick Kyrgios took to Twitter to thank his supporters who inundated him with messages of congratulations .

"They're the street girls from Afghanistan who are taking up skateboarding to save their lives. Hundreds of young girls in the war-torn country have signed up with charity Skateistan to get off the streets and back into school. The chaos and destruction of 30 years of war in Afghanistan have created a country where children have few role models - and instead see dangerous fanatical figures and murderous war lords as the leaders of society. But the charity are now working to create a new generation of leaders in the country, and recently opened their first outdoor skatepark in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. Scroll down for video . Here come the girls: at Skateistan's new facility in Mazar-e-Sharif, more than 40 per cent of their pupils are girls. Founder Ollie said: 'We want the girls to see one another as role models instead of the war lords who would drive around town with a car load of men who are waving guns around' Inspiration: Skateistan 'use skateboarding as a tool for empowering youth, to create new opportunities and the potential for change'. They are giving new hope to a new generation of children in Afghanistan . Opportunity: The charity want to inspire the children on to greater things. 'Skateistan is about creating opportunities for the kids so that they can see that it is possible for them to have a chance to do what they want for their lives', said Ollie . Skateboard star: Halifa, 16, is one of Afghanistan's best skaters. She said: 'When I came to Skateistan, my life changed so much, because when I was working on the street, people would harass me' Hanifa, 16, was selling tea on the streets and in the parks of ravaged Kabul when she first visited one the charity's skateparks in 2010. Now she is one Afghanistan’s most talented skaters and has become an inspiring teacher and role model for other young girls and has even joined Skateistan’s staff in the city as an instructor. The teenager said: 'When I came to Skateistan, my life changed so much, because when I was working on the street, people would harass me. 'Now I feel good because I'm at Skateistan and I'm teaching the students. When the students call me teacher, it makes me very happy. I think by becoming a good skater, I'll create a better future for myself.' Hanifa has enrolled in the charity's Back To School programme, and is hoping to return to public school with her friends. Challenging: the charity's new outdoor facility in Mazar-e-Sharif features an outdoor classroom and skatepark obstacles for students to tackle . The charity was set up by Ollie Percovich, who believes that the 800 children he is working with across the country are determined to build a better future for themselves, . Ollie, from Melbourne in Australia, said: ‘We want the girls to see one another as role models instead of the war lords who would drive around town with a car load of men who are waving guns around. ‘It’s important that they have role models, and we want their role models to be other Afghan kids who are healthy and happy. The girls can see that they now have opportunities and options in their lives that may have not been there before. ‘Skateistan is about creating opportunities for the kids so that they can see that it is possible for them to have a chance to do what they want for their lives.’ Children in Afghanistan have lived amongst conflict for more than 30 years and the country was named by charity Unicef as the worst place in the world to be born. But Skateistan staff are contributing to a new sense of hope in the country, and Ollie said: ‘We want to help create a new generation of leaders in Afghanistan that can tackle the problems that they face in society. ‘People might come to Afghanistan and say ‘Your political system is corrupt’ or ‘Your education system is not good enough’, but rather than tell them how to fix it, we want the kids to understand that what they consider to be important issues are the things that they can help change. ‘There are issues with drugs, such as opium and heroin abuse. Other things such as self-immolation, forced marriages and policemen taking bribes can be a problem. ‘We want to create a situation where they can stand up and tackle these problems in society as young Afghan people who want to make their country a better place.’ The charity started in 2007 with just three skateboards and a motorbike to transport them around ravaged Kabul but investment meant they were soon able to open their own skate park for budding boarders. The new outdoor facility in Mazar-e-Sharif has been designed to feature pathways with skatepark obstacles, an outdoor classroom, trees for shade, grass areas for outdoor sports, gardens and a greenhouse. Founder: Ollie first visited Afghanistan in 2006 and established Skateistan the following year. He said: 'We want to help create a new generation of leaders in Afghanistan that can tackle the problems that they face in society' Ollie, 40, said: 'This is the first outdoor skate facility in the country, so it represents a big step forward for us. It was really exciting for us to be able to work on the design which has been made to look like a traditional Afghan garden. 'This is a unique space in Afghanistan, where opportunities to safely skateboard outside are rare – especially for female students. We have about 550 students in Mazar-e-Sharif and just under half of those – around 47 per cent – are girls. ‘We have the capability to host a lot more than that, so we are currently in the process of building up our number of teachers and hopefully getting more buses to help transport the students to the facility.’ The challenges faced by Ollie and his team remain difficult, and in 2012 they were heartbroken when one of their teachers and three students were brutally murdered during a suicide attack on international military base in Kabul. Recent estimates claim that there have been more than 21,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan due to war in the last 11 years alone. Ollie and his dedicated team work daily to get kids off the streets and back into the education system through their learning programmes and projects. ‘We have three different groups that they join, depending on their age and circumstances: Skate And Create, Back To School and Youth Leadership’, he said. Wheel-y great: The outdoor space in Mazar-e-Sharif has been designed to feature pathways with skatepark obstacles, an outdoor classroom, trees for shade, grass areas for outdoor sports, gardens and a greenhouse. No obstacle: the young girls love tackling the ramps on the skatepark, and are also learning how to overcome Afghanistan's wider society problems in the classroom as well . New hope: skateboarding is giving a new lease of life to the street kids in the country, which has a population of approximately 31 million people . ‘Skate And Create is a session where they are encouraged to use their creative ability alongside practising their skateboarding. ‘Back To School is a very important one as that is where we take the street kids who have dropped out of the education system and put them on an accelerated course to get back into school. ‘And Youth Leadership is for the slightly older students where we give them opportunities to become more responsible leaders amongst their peer groups, as well as get involved in creative elements such as photography and blogging and so on. ‘The courses are designed very much as a springboard so that the students can use take the opportunity to improve themselves and enjoy skateboarding sessions as well.’ For more information on Skateistan, visit: http://www.skateistan.org/ . Bright future: Skateistan offers hope to the young girls in the war-torn country, where there are estimated to have been more than 21,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan due to war in the last 11 years alone . Colourful: Skateistan are open six days per week and offers single gender classes to keep boys and girls separate while they skate . All smiles: Women can't ride bicycles in Afghanistan, but skateboarding is novel enough to be open to women and has attracted them in droves to the school and skateparks where classes are free . Success: One of the world's poorest and most conservative countries seems a strange place to set up a skateboarding school, but the founders say it has proved a remarkably successful way to reach out to marginalized children, particularly girls .","Skateistan tackling social problems by offering skateboarding and school lessons to street kids .

"Members of Congress waved pencils in the air on Tuesday night as they paid tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo terror attack during President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. Speaking to a joint session of Congress, Obama, 53, declared that America stands 'united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists', including the 17 recently slain in France. At the same time, dozens of people in the House chamber raised unsharpened yellow pencils into the air in a show of support for free speech following the brutal January 7 attack on the magazine. Four hundred pencils had been brought to the address by Rep. congresswoman Gwen Moore, who believed Congress had an opportunity on Tuesday to condemn the massacre with one voice. Scroll down for videos . Showing their support: Members of Congress waved pencils in the air on Tuesday night as they paid tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo terror attack during President Obama's State of the Union address . Taking part: Democraats Sheila Jackson Lee (left) and John Lewis (right) hold up pencils during the speech . Standing united: Speaking to a joint session of Congress, Obama, 53, declared that America stands 'united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists', including the 17 recently slain in France . The Wisconsin Democrat 'held up a yellow pencil' herself 'to honor those who lost their lives in the pursuit of open ideas and free expression,' her spokesman, Eric Harris, told DailyMail.com. Speaking before the speech, Mr Harris said he hoped the number of those involved in the display would be 'in the hundreds', saying:  'We've invited all our Republican colleagues.' He added: 'The congresswoman will have pencils with her on the floor. We're bringing 400. The gesture is not meant to insult Muslims nor is it an attack on Islam.' There are 534 members of Congress, including the 100 senators who shoehorned themselves into the crowded hall. (One seat was vacant after former New York Rep. Michael Grimm's resignation.) At 4pm on Tuesday, Mr Harris said that nearly three dozen members of Congress had confirmed they would be participating in the Charlie Hebdo salute, which was broadcast live on television. However, it is currently unknown exactly how many members of Congress ended up doing so. The pencils were deliberately unsharpened due to security concerns. Getting involved: As Obama spoke, dozens of people in the House chamber raised unsharpened yellow pencils into the air in a show of support for free speech following the brutal January 7 attack on the magazine . Grand plan: Four hundred pencils had been brought to the address by congresswoman Gwen Moore (center), who believed Congress had an opportunity on Tuesday to condemn the massacre with one voice . Striking: The yellow pencil has become a symbol of free expression across Europe follong the attack . Twelve people, including two police officers and five Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, were gunned down when two Islamist gunmen stormed the magazine's offices  and opened fire. The following day, a French policewoman was shot dead in France's capital. And on Friday, four hostages were killed when another Islamist terrorist seized a Jewish grocery store. Addressing Congress, Obama, whose wife, Michelle, was seated in a box with nearly two dozen specially-invited guests, said: 'We stand united with people around the world who’ve been targeted by terrorists – from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. 'We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we’ve done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies.' But he acknowledged that America has 'learned some costly lessons over the last thirteen years.' Speaking to DailyMail.com before the address, Mr Harris explained that French citizens have turned ordinary pencils into protest implements in the weeks since the Charlie Hebdo attack. Holding a pencil above ones head is now an internationally recognized disapproval of censorship. Where was Potus? A January 11 rally of millions in Paris went off without President Barack Obama, who was reportedly watching football; he will likely try to express his solidarity in his State of the Union address . Erasers: Muslims in Pakistan and elsewhere have rallied to condemn the Paris magazine for showing cartoons ofMuhammad . From Paris to Barcelona to London, pencils lifted skyward have carried a message of support for what Charlie Hebdo stands for – an irreverent and unapologetic mocking tone toward anyone and anything of importance. 'We'd like to do it every time the president refers to the victims, and every time he refers to freedom of speech or expression,' he said. The idea for a pencil protest began as a Democrats-only stunt, passed in secret from press secretary to press secretary. Then an email from Mr Harris to his colleagues was leaked to National Journal. Suddenly it was a bipartisan idea, open to both sides of the aisle. European Union: As far away as the UK and Turkey – this woman demonstrated in Ankara – people have held pencils aloft to signify the defense of free expression in the face of religious extremism . 'This is something we just planned to do privately, and then it would just be a surprise during the State of the Union,' Mr Harris told DailyMail.com. 'But because my email was leaked – that's just how it goes. I should have just put ""confidential"" on top of it,' he joked, 'and made sure it leaked in about ten seconds.' Separately, the House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday officially condemning the Charlie Hebdo attack and a separate deadly act of terror at a Paris kosher supermarket. 'Seventeen innocents lost their lives, and this resolution carries our condolences to their loved ones,' House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. 'With this condemnation also comes a commitment to stand with France and our allies in confronting the grave threat radical Islam poses to our security and way of life,' he said.","Members of Congress waved pencils in air during State of Union address .

"The richest 80 people in the world have been revealed... and 35 of them are American. According to a new report from Oxfam International, the combined wealth of the 80 richest billionaires is the same as that of the bottom 50% of the Earth's population - 3.5 billion people. The report, 'Wealth: Having It All and Wanting More,' was released as the World Economic Forum begins this week in Davos, Switzerland. Oxfam's report explained that it calculated figures from Credit Suisse and based its list of wealthiest figures off Forbes' billionaires list, which was published in March 2014. 'By 2014, the 80 people who top the Forbes rich list had a collective wealth of $1.9tn,' the charity's report said. According to the Forbes list, the five wealthiest people in the world are Bill Gates (net worth $76 billion), Carlos Slim Helu (net worth $72 billion), Amancio Ortega (net worth $64 billion), Warren Buffett (net worth $58.2 billion), and Larry Ellison (net worth $48 billion). Scroll down for video . Rich: (From left to right) Bill Gates's 2014 net worth was $76 billion, Carlos Slim Helu's $72 billion, and Amancio Ortega's  $64 billion, per the Forbes list published in March 2014. Eight of the top ten wealthiest billionaires are American . The combined wealth of the 80 richest billionaires is the same amount as that of the bottom 50% of the Earth's population - 3.5 billion people - Oxfam said in a new report . Rounding out the top ten are brothers Charles and David Koch (whose net worth was tied at $40 billion), Sheldon Adelson (net worth $38 billion), Christy Walton (net worth $36.7 billion) and Jim Walton (net worth $34.7 billion). 492 people out of the 1,645 billionaires on the 2014 Forbes list are US citizens, Oxfam pointed out. Aside from Slim Helu and Ortega - who are from Mexico and Spain, respectively - all the billionaires in the top ten are Americans. Oxfam found that 388 billionaires had the same amount of money as the bottom 50% of the Earth's population in 2010. The charity's report also said that the richest 1 percent of the population will own more than half the world's wealth by 2016. Oxfam said the world's richest people saw their share of global wealth jump to 48 percent last year from 44 percent in 2009. Wealthy: (From left to right) Warren Buffett's 2014 net worth was $58.2 billion and Larry Ellison's net worth was $48 billion . Brothers: Charles Koch (left) and David Koch (right) each had a 2014 net worth of $40 billion according to the Forbes billionaires list . Rising inequality is holding back the fight against global poverty as the world's biggest companies lobby the U.S. and European Union for beneficial tax changes at a time when average taxpayers are still paying the bill for the financial crisis, Oxfam said. 'Do we really want to live in a world where the 1 percent own more than the rest of us combined?' Winnie Byanyima, Oxfam's executive director, said in a statement. 'The scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering, and despite the issues shooting up the global agenda, the gap between the richest and the rest is widening fast.' While world leaders such as President Barack Obama and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde have talked about tackling extreme economic inequality 'we are still waiting for many of them to walk the walk,' Byanyima said. The healthcare and financial services industries spent almost $900 million to lobby the U.S. government for favorable legislation in 2013, and more than $200 million was spent on lobbying in the EU, Oxfam said. At the same time, one in nine people don't have enough to eat and more than a billion people live on less than $1.25 a day, Oxfam said, ticking off statistics that paint a grim picture for all but the world's richest. The charity is calling for a crackdown on tax avoidance by corporations and rich people, as well as increased investment in health and education and equal pay legislation. Among the wealthiest: (From left to right) Sheldon Adelson's 2014 net worth was $38 billion, Christy Walton's was$36.7 billion, and Jim Walton's was $34.7 billion .

"A woman who was served ‘raw’ chicken when she visited McDonald’s for the first time in nearly two years says she will never dine at the fast food chain again. Describing the moment she took 'two huge mouthfuls' of the wrap because she was starving, Gizela Tahuri told Daily Mail Australia: 'I thought this is really really soft and pulled out the chicken strip inside and I thought “oh my god that is actually raw”.' The shocked personal trainer posted a disgusting image online of the uncooked chicken she found inside her McWrap when she visited a McDonald’s store at Deception Bay, a suburb 32 kilometres north of Brisbane, in Queensland. ‘So much for healthy choices McDonald's when you serve RAW chicken. I haven't eaten McDonalds for nearly 2 years and now I know why. Mmm I'm not loving it,’ she wrote on Facebook. Scroll down for video . 'So much for healthy choices': Gizela Tahuri bit into this raw chicken at a McDonald's store in Queensland . After the experience made her feel ‘really queasy sick’ she vowed that she won’t eat McDonald’s again: ‘I definitely wouldn’t eat there, I would make sure I have food in my bag.’ Tahuri, a personal trainer from Brisbane, usually avoids eating McDonald’s but caved in because she was on holiday and en route to visit her mum’s house. ‘I have two kids and thought we’d go just for a treat and I was raving hungry. The only thing I could eat was from healthy choices menu and I get sick if I don’t eat,’ Tahuri said. ‘As a PT I can’t be seen eating a Big Mac and I can’t stomach that anymore,’ she added. Tahuri, 32, first noticed something was wrong when they got to her mum’s house and took two large bites. ‘Luckily I didn’t catch anything or fall sick.’ The mother of two who runs her own business PT Giz said that while her children, aged 6 and 8, are fans of the chain she will now ‘double check the food each time’ before handing them any burgers. ‘I’m a bit hesitant,’ she added. Gizela Tahuri, 32, hadn't eaten at McDonald's for nearly two years when hunger struck and she decided to buy a 'healthy' wrap with her children as a treat . The experience made her feel 'really queasy sick' she vowed that she won’t eat McDonald’s again . Tahuri says she did not have time to go back to McDonald’s and complain because she had to go straight to work. She believes the raw food was ‘an isolated incident’. But warned: ‘I really hope it doesn’t happen to anyone else, especially pregnant ladies.’ A McDonald’s spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We are disappointed that this has happened. 'We take food safety very seriously and have strict processes and systems in place. An investigation is currently underway with the restaurant, and we encourage the customer to contact us to help us to investigate fully.' The chicken McWrap is advertised as boasting 'a strip of succulent, marinated and crumbed chicken'. It is accompanied by 'fresh Australian lettuce and creamy mayonnaise' and is 'carefully' hand wrapped in a tortilla.

"During the incredible building boom of early 20th century, it was said that crew foremen could expect one man to die for every $1million spent on a skyscraper. In these heady early years - when industry barons raced each other to see who could get their towers built first - workers had few protections. They wore no hard hats or safety ropes. But even inches from peril, some men managed to laugh in the face of death. These incredible pictures show construction workers goofing off as they built some of America's most iconic skyscrapers. The most famous of these, of course, is Charles C. Ebbets infamous shot 'Lunch atop a Skyscraper,' snapped in 1932 of 11 workers having lunch on an exposed steel beam 840 feet above the ground. Scroll down for video . Dinner with a view: These workers atop the frame of the Waldorf-Astoria in 1930 enjoyed some of the hotel's legendary five-star service before construction was even complete . Here, a worker defies death as he walks a plank between two girders while blindfolded in 1925. This took place more than 20 stories in the air . Hanging out: This worker takes a break 30 stories above the New York City streets . Hello there! In this image from 1931, a worker leans out over the city as he works on the Empire State Building. Five men died during the construction of the iconic skyscraper . However Ebbets also snapped a worker practicing his golf swing on the same 70-story construction site - the RCA  Building, now knows as the GE Building or 30 Rockefeller Plaza. A 1930 photograph reveals that the Waldorf Astoria began offering its legendary first-class service well before it even opened. Two bow tie and jacket-clad waiters are pictured serving a gourmet lunch to a pair of workers on a girder high above Park Avenue. Another photo, from 1925 shows a blindfolded worker walking between two girders 20 stories above the street. One photo shows a workers climbing up a wrecking ball while working on the Empire State Building in 1930. The stunts are no laughing matter. Five men died in accidents during the breakneck construction of the Empire State Building. An estimated 27 workers perished during the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, which was completed in 1883. 'Building skyscrapers is the nearest peace-time equivalent of war. In fact, the analogy is startling, even to the occasional grim reality of a building accident where maimed bodies, and even death, remind us that we are fighting a war of construction against the forces of nature,' work foreman William Starrette was quoted as saying . Daredevils from the Jones Family carried out a sword fight on the edge of the Times Square Hotel in 1925 as part of a stunt . Death-defying: The performers may have climbed this skyscraper for publicity, but construction workers thumbed their noses at loftier heights every day as part of their job . Hanging in: Workmen had near fear of swinging high above the city - with nothing by a few ropes and chains between them and oblivion . Taste of his own medicine: A 1900s cameraman looks a bit unsteady as he hovers one foot over the hedge while walking across steal girders of a skyscraper . A magazine reporter who wrote about the high-flying construction workers in 1908 - at the start of the skyscraper boom - dubbed the men 'cowboys of the skies.' Ernest Poole recalled several examples of men being killed while just going about their daily jobs - being blown off girders by high winds, losing their footing and slipping to their deaths, being smashed by steel as it was being hoisted hundreds of feet into place. But he also documented stories of silly, risk-taking recklessness. He described how a hapless foreman at the Singer Building - then the tallest structure in the world - . 'Time again on returning, he would find some delighted man monkey high up by the big brass ball taking a loot at the sea.' The daredevil Gladys Roy balanced on a rooftop high above Los Angeles in 1925 for a stunt . These four men are hoping to pass a test to get jobs as painters at the Brooklyn Bridge. Their first task was to climb to the top of one of the pillars. An estimated 27 workers died building the bridge .","During the early era of skyscraper construction, it was said that one worker died for every $1million spent on the building .

"When two famous Czech actors agreed to pose as disabled police officers and stop people for 'speeding',  it seemed like an innocent enough prank. But the charity video went horribly wrong when one of the men they flagged down suffered a heart-attack, upon hearing it was a candid camera stunt. The men have since claimed they intended to gauge people's reactions to being pulled over by disabled policemen, in a bid to raise awareness. Scroll down for video . Prank: The two famous Czech actors dressed up as disabled police officers (pictured) to gauge people's reactions to being pulled over for speeding . Horror: The stunt went horribly wrong when one man had a heart-attack, upon hearing it was a prank . Good intentions: Petr Ctvrtnicek told an appeal court: 'The aim was to help disabled people and we did it in good faith' One was in a wheelchair while the other used crutches, in the video organised by charity Konto Bariery. Jan Potmesil, 48, and Petr Ctvrtnicek, 50, were given suspended sentences in October last year for their involvement in the prank. A district court in the Czech capital Prague has since acquitted the actors of the crime of impersonating a police officer. Mr Potmesil told the appeal court: 'It was not our aim [to harm someone] and I am really, very sorry about it. 'I thought that we were doing something good and we thought that everything would be all right.' Fellow actor Petr Ctvrtnicek said: 'I agree. The aim was to help disabled people and we did it in good faith.' The charity video, which was filmed in 2012 in Prague, was due to air on Czech national television. The court in Prague initially found both actors guilty of using impersonating the police because they wore uniforms and were carrying out police activities.

"A British student survived for eight nights on a mountain in Turkey by eating insects and sheltering in a cave. David Mackie, 21, went missing with two Dutch friends after the trio became lost in bad weather and flooding, during what was supposed to be a one-day hiking trip on January 11. Mr Mackie and fellow students Frisko De Vries and Merije De Groot, all 21, finally managed to get a signal on his mobile phone five days later and made an emergency call to summon help. By then, the handset had just two per cent battery left. Scroll down for video . David Mackie, 21, went missing with two friends after they became lost in bad weather  during a hiking trip on a Turkish mountain on January 11. Pictured: Mr Mackie reunited with his family after being rescued this week . Marije de Groot, 21, from the Netherlands, received a hug from a relative after the trio were taken to the Kemer district of Antalya, Turkey, following their rescue. They survived a week on the mountain without any food . Dutchman Frisko De Vries, also 21, also looked relieved to be reunited with loved ones after the trio were brought back to safety. They were rescued after eight days on the mountain after finding mobile phone signal . Briton David Mackie (above), from Nottinghamshire, said finding phone signal 'probably saved our lives'. He said the trio survived on the mountain for a week by drinking water from the springs and eating insects . The trio were last seen in Turkey's touristic long-distance footpath The Lycian Way, which is approximately 540km long and stretches from the Aegean Sea coast to the Mediterranean region. Pictured: Frisko De Vries . The group were taken to hospital following their rescue but all were released without any serious injuries . Briton David  Mackie (right) and Dutch citizens Friso  De Vries (left) and Marije De Groot (centre) pictured after their rescue. They became friends while studying together in Istanbul and travelled to Turkey for the hike trip . The trio, who were studying in Istanbul, were rescued and airlifted to safety on Monday in a mission captured on head cam. Speaking afterwards, Mr Mackie, from Nottinghamshire, said: ‘That phone call probably saved our lives.’ The group had survived on rainwater as they attempted to follow a dry river bed to safety, before retreating to a cave when the riverbed suddenly flooded and nearly washed them away. Mr Mackie was taken to hospital following the drama on the Lycian Way long-distance path in Antalya. He suffered no serious injuries and has now been discharged. The student told reporters in Turkey the trio chose to fly to Antalya because the local area offered some of the best hiking routes in the country. He added: ‘We got to a point where a valley stopped us from going any further. We tried to turn back but the riverbed was full because of the rain, so we couldn’t turn back. ‘After that, it was a matter of trying to cross the river, trying to eat what we could. Mr Mackie (right) said the ordeal left them all ‘extremely hungry and exhausted,' but they are now recovering . They were located by a coastguard helicopter after managing to find mobile phone signal five days after going missing. It took rescuers a couple of days to trace them before they were rescued from the mountain . Mr De Vries clutches a bottle of water and chocolate bar as he is stretchered off the rescue helicopter . The group became lost in bad weather  during a hike on The Lycian Way (Likya Yolu)  in Antalya, Turkey . ‘This was seven days without (proper) food. We ate a few ants and things like that and drank spring water from the mountains.’ He said the group could hear traffic and the call to prayer from a nearby town, but were ‘so high up that there was no way down.' The ordeal left the trio ‘extremely hungry and exhausted’, he added. His parents, Christopher and Alison, both 54, had also raised the alarm after Mr Mackie had failed to catch a flight back to Istanbul. Their son was finally able to make the emergency call on Friday, five days after the group set out on the hike. Searches began in a bid to locate the group, with hundreds of local people joining the rescue effort, but it was not until Monday that the friends were finally located. By then, Mr and Mrs Mackie had flown out to Turkey. Friends and family flew to Turkey to await news of the rescue, before being told the good news (pictured) Parents of the rescued hikers thanked the Turkish authorities for the 'absolute dedication' in finding them . Friends and family of the trio embraced each other as the helicopter returned to them with their loves ones . The family are expected back in Radcliffe-on-Trent, near Nottingham, today. His sister Hannah Mackie, 22, told the BBC the family were still in shock over what happened. She said: ‘It’s been the worst week of my life... we’re so relieved, we’re still in disbelief. ‘You don’t think it’s going to happen to you.’ Her father has thanked the Turkish authorities ‘for their absolute dedication in finding’ his son.","David Mackie went missing with two friends during January 11 hiking trip .

He had told the court he initially had issues with the clothing of Australian women but had always been taught to respect people. Mohebbifar approached the 19-year-old woman on the Anzac Bridge early on January 16. She initially managed to brush off his questions and walk away, but soon after heard his footsteps quickening into a run towards her. Despite her screaming and protests, he pushed her into a bush and sexually assaulted her, Judge Woodburne said. He unzipped his pants but suddenly stopped and left.

Police later discovered Mohebbifar 'hiding under a car, sweating profusely and breathing heavily'. 'To be accosted, seized and dragged off the street by a complete stranger must have been terrifying,' Judge Woodburne said on Wednesday during his sentencing. 'She was doing nothing more than peacefully going about her business walking along public streets to go home.' The court heard Mohebbifar had felt excluded, depressed and socially isolated in the lead-up to the attack and did not know why he carried it out. 'I wasn't myself and I'm truly sorry,' he said. Mohebbifar had told the court he initially had issues with the clothing of Australian women but had always been taught to respect people (file photo) He said he had stopped the assault after unzipping his pants because 'it was like suddenly my conscience woke up'. 'He wanted a girlfriend but was not sure how to make contact,' Judge Woodburne said. Mohebbifar cried as he was sentenced to a minimum of six years and a maximum of eight. 'The fact that he will or might be deported is irrelevant to this sentencing exercise,' Judge Woodburne said. He will be eligible for parole in January 2020.","Amir Mohebbifar, 27, was sentenced to six years in jail for sexual assault .

"A millionaire car dealer is about to begin his third trial on charges that he murdered his wife - but his children are insisting that he is innocent. Calvin Harris, 53, is accused of bludgeoning his wife Michele, 35, to death in their home in Spencer, New York on the night of September 11, 2001 as they went through a bitter divorce. But Harris, whose third trial will start this week after his two previous convictions were overturned, continues to maintain his innocence - and his four children, aged between 15 and 20, agree. 'I believe in him,' his son Tanner, 15, told People magazine. Back to court: Calvin Harris, pictured left in court in 2009, is heading back to court this week for his third trial for the murder of his estranged wife, Michele, pictured right, who vanished in September 2001 . His daughter, Cayla, 19, added: 'He might not have gotten along with my mom toward the end, but I know he loved my mom very much, and he tells me all the time she was a beautiful person, a great mother, and he would never do anything to hurt the mother of his children.' Cayla, whose father has been in and out of prison throughout her life, says if her father is convicted again she will stay at home during her first few years of college to care for her younger siblings. Harris heads back to court this week for jury selection. This trial has been moved 140 miles away from his home to Schoharie County, after attorneys feared he would not get a fair trial in his own county. 'I'm just fighting to survive for these kids,' Harris told People. 'Nobody on the face of this earth deserves to be treated as I have.' At the time of his wife's disappearance, he and Michele were living separately under the same roof as they brought up their children and hashed out the details of their separation. Family: They are pictured with their children, who were between two and seven when she went missing . Support: Harris is pictured with his children, (from left) Taylor, 20, Jenna, 17, Cayla, 19, and Tanner, 15. The four teenagers have said they believe their father is innocent of killing their mother . After Mrs Harris filed for divorce in January 2001, her husband had an estimated worth of $5.4 million - and she rejected an initial statement offering her primary child custody and $740,000. At the time she went missing, a trial had been scheduled to reach a deal. Prosecutors said Harris' motive for killing his wife was to keep his hands on his fortune. Her hairdresser testified that she had heard Harris tell his wife in a phone call: 'Drop the divorce proceedings. Do you hear me? I will [expletive] kill you. I can make you disappear.' On the night she went missing, she went out for drinks with friends before stopping at her boyfriend's apartment. Her minivan was found at the end of her home's drive the following morning. Calvin Harris called the babysitter around 7am on September 12, 2001 to say that his wife had not returned from a night out so he needed help getting the children ready. Her body was never found and investigators also failed to turn up a murder weapon, but they did find tiny splatters of her blood in the home, although their date was not determined. Emotional: In 2014, they appeared with their father as they appealed for information about the disappearance . By his side: Harris, pictured with Jenna, left, and Cayla, right, is currently out on bail after his conviction was overturned for the second time in 2012. He had previously been convicted of murder in 2007 and 2009 . Investigators also noted that there were no signs of struggle in the home and that Harris did not have any marks on his body indicating his wife had fought him. Four years after she went missing, Harris was charged with murder and - after his indictment was initially thrown out - he was re-charged and convicted of her killing in June 2007. But just a day later, a witness came forward to say he had seen Michele arguing with a man near to the couple's driveway and the case was re-opened. After spending five months in prison, Harris was freed and a new trial was ordered. But he was found guilty in the second trial in October 2009 and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. During the first two trials, District Attorney Gerald Keene argued that Harris was the only logical suspect in the case, the Press & Sun Bulletin reported. He argued that Michele was struck with an object at least twice in the home's kitchen and that, sometime between 11pm and 7am, he managed to dispose of her body and the weapon. But in 2011, a judge in an appeals court said evidence in the case was insufficient to convict him, and it was sent to New York's Court of Appeals. In court: Harris is pictured in court in Tioga County July 2005 ahead of his first indictment in the case. This third trial will leave the county and be held 140 miles away in an attempt to make proceedings fair . Scene: Prosecutors say Harris hit his wife twice across the head with an object on the night of September 11, 2001 at the home they still shared, pictured, before disposing of her body before 7am the next day . The court also found problems with the second trial - such as one of the jurors having pre-conceived ideas about the case - and threw out his conviction for a second time. He was freed again in October 2012 on the $500,000 bail he had posted back in 2007 and is now awaiting his third trial, which is due to begin this week. Harris and his attorney argue that since the start of the investigation, he has been the only person authorities focused on. 'They have fixated on Cal from the beginning of this, and they are just not going to admit they got it wrong,' said his attorney Bruce Barket. The attorney suggested that they know of another person who could be responsible for the murder, but he did not name them. Michele's family told People that they stand by his convictions.","Michele Harris, 35, vanished from Spencer, New York on September 11, 2001 but her body or a murder weapon have never been found .

"Darren Wilson isn't expected to face civil rights charges over the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last August after an F.B.I. investigation found no evidence to support charges, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday. The Justice Department has yet to make any official announcement, but sources close to the department have said such a prosecution would be unlikely, in part because of the extraordinarily high legal standard federal prosecutors would need to meet. Wilson was cleared in November by a state grand jury in the August 9 death of Michael Brown, a shooting that touched off protests in the streets and became part of a national conversation about race relations and police departments that patrol minority neighborhoods. Scroll down for video . Darren Wilson isn't expected to face civil rights charges over the fatal shooting of Michael Brown last August after an F.B.I. investigation found no evidence to support charges . Attorney General Eric Holder visited Ferguson in the days after the shooting to calm tensions and meet with Brown's family and law enforcement. Wilson, who shot Brown after a scuffle in the middle of the street, told the grand jury that reviewed the case that he feared for his life when Brown hit him and reached for his gun. Some witnesses have said Brown had his hands up when Wilson shot him. To mount a federal prosecution, the Justice Department would need to show that Wilson willfully deprived Brown of his civil rights. That standard, which means prosecutors must prove that an officer knowingly used more force than the law allowed, is challenging for the government to meet. Multiple high-profile police-involved deaths, including the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo in New York City, have not resulted in federal charges. Attorney General Eric Holder visited Ferguson in the days after the shooting to calm tensions and meet with Brown's family and law enforcement . Protests in Ferguson: A separate, broader Justice Department-led investigation into the practices of the Ferguson police department remains open . Wilson, who had been on administrative leave since the shooting, resigned days after the grand jury decision. A separate, broader Justice Department-led investigation into the practices of the Ferguson police department remains open. That investigation, which will examine potential racial bias among officers, has the potential to have more sweeping consequences than any individual criminal prosecutions, experts say. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Justice Department lawyers were preparing a memo recommending against prosecuting Wilson, but that the memo was not yet complete and that Attorney General Eric Holder — who is expected to leave his position within weeks — had not yet made a decision. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Brown's family, said in a statement that the family would not address speculation from anonymous officials and was waiting for an official Justice Department announcement. Wilson was cleared in November by a state grand jury in the August 9 death of Michael Brown, a shooting that touched off protests in the streets . Neil Bruntrager, an attorney for Wilson, said Wilson's lawyers had received no communications from the Justice Department and would not comment until there was a final determination. 'We don't believe he has done anything that would merit any kind of a prosecution or any kind of civil rights claims and we are just awaiting the outcome like everybody else,' Bruntrager said in a telephone interview.","Wilson isn't expected to face civil rights charges over the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last August .

"A solicitor who knocked himself unconscious on his stag do after plummeting down a flight of stairs dressed as a nurse believes it was the quick-thinking of air ambulance medics that saved his life. Andrew Croft tumbled down the stairs at the Round House pub in Covent Garden, London while celebrating his impending nuptials last March. The 29-year-old was knocked unconscious and an ambulance was called. London's Air Ambulance responded, sending a crew to the scene in a rapid response car, with an ambulance following. A doctor immediately gave Mr Croft an anaesthetic - the act he believes saved his life. Andrew Croft, 29, from Kennington in south London, fell down a flight of stairs while dressed as a nurse on his stag do in Covent Garden . But thanks to the quick actions of London's Air Ambulance, the solicitor's life was saved and he walked down the aisle six weeks later to marry his girlfriend Fiona . The air ambulance crew, who arrived at the pub in a fast-response car, administered a rapid sequence induction (RSI) anaesthetic to put him to sleep and reduce the risk of brain damage. Mr Croft, of Kennington, south London, said he can't remember anything about the incident. But he was able to recover and walked down the aisle six weeks later. 'I'm really lucky to be back to normal with no long term ill effects,' he said. 'I was told that if I'd been left in the position that the air ambulance medics found me I might not have made it through. 'I left work to go to the stag do last March, and I don't remember anything about it after that. 'I think it's the accident. Because of hitting my head it just wiped out my memory.' Watching Mr Croft recovering in hospital, his fiance Fiona, 29, agonised over whether to cancel the May wedding. She and his family remained at his bedside at the Royal London hospital for four days, and while he recuperated at St Thomas's hospital. 'We were lucky - we didn't have to rearrange the wedding,' Mr Croft said. 'My wife just decided we were going to go ahead with it at a time my prognosis was a bit uncertain. That gave me something to focus on. 'I was still recovering with my tiredness, but because of the day and all the excitement I managed to keep going. 'If anything, my family felt the worst of the incident more so than I did because I was out of it and unaware of what was going on. 'With head injuries, it's hard for doctors to give a clear prognosis until at least a week after the event, so there was a lot of uncertainty for them about whether I'd even be able to get married.' He credits the actions of the air ambulance crew with saving his life. A doctor gave Mr Croft an anaesthetic as soon as he arrived at the scene at the Round House pub. It put Mr Croft into an induced coma . Inducing a coma takes the pressure off the brain and reduces the risk of brain damage. Mr Croft is pictured left, recovering in hospital with his father, and right with his wife Fiona . Mr Croft, pictured with his father and best man brother Darryl, said if it weren't for the air ambulance team he wouldn't have survived. He is supporting a campaign to help the London Air Ambulance fund a second helicopter to help more patients in the capital . Mr Croft said if it weren't for the London Air Ambulance, he wouldn't have made it down the aisle. 'I'm massively grateful for the fact they came and treated me,' he said. 'I'm pretty sure it had a significant impact on me being able to recover so quickly. They are so used to dealing with these sorts of injuries. 'I had to have four months off work as a result and I realised that life is quite fragile. 'It has made me more pro-active and made me want to live life while I can.' He is speaking out in support of the air ambulance's new campaign, launching next month to buy a second helicopter. He said guests at his wedding in Wymondham Abbey, Norfolk, laughed when they heard what he had been wearing when he was found by medics. He added: 'My brother, Darryl, was my best man.

"A woman has lost nearly 8st after motivating herself to stick to a diet by taking selfies and posting them online. Eva Rut Gunnlaugsdottir, 35, from Reykjavik, Iceland, weighed 19st 2lb in January last year when she finally tackled her weight gain after the birth of her two children. The mother-of-two felt so bad about how she looked in the images that they spurred her to carry on eating healthily and keep documenting the results. Scroll down for video . Eva credits taking regular selfies with helping her drop from 19st 2lb (left) to 11st 4lb (right) Eva says that while she finds it painful to look back at earlier selfies (left), she is much more confident now . Eva felt constantly embarrassed by her self-portraits but used that shame to stay on course. She said: 'I posted the first one almost as a joke. I felt really bad about myself and looked bad and I felt if I could start to see the change it might help me to carry on. 'But in fact I was also so embarrassed about the images that it was something that made me determined to carry on.' Her diet before consisted mainly of takeaways, fast food, ready meals, lots of cheese and sandwiches laden with fatty fillings. She also snacked on chocolate, biscuits, crisps and high calorie snacks. Determined to shed the pounds she revamped her her diet, eating healthy homemade meals such as soups, lots of fruit, vegetable, lean meats and salads. She also cut out certain food categories including wheat, sugar and starch. Eva says her friends soon noticed the change in her appearance, with every successive selfie . The first posting that she had posted online had included the message: 'just a joke, selfie no. 1.' 'I've always had trouble controlling my diet and have been immensely overweight since I was 18 years old,' she said . Although many of the selfies are just of her face, the difference in her size as she loses weight is obvious . The first snap  she posted online included the message: 'Just a joke, selfie no.1.' On the worst days when she felt desperate for chocolate, she only needed to scroll back over the previous selfies to remind herself what it was all about, and get the energy to carry on. She said: 'My friends were the ones who pointed out the difference between then and now pictures, and that kept me on the diet.' Eva says a major reason she wanted to lose weight was to have energy for her children Agust, left, and Eva . When temped to reach for chocolate she  scrolled back through the pictures to see how far she had come . By the end of the year she had managed to shed 7st 12lb. 'I felt fantastic. In fact I felt fantastic after the first few days and that feeling just continued,' she said. The first picture she posted online had included the message: 'Just a joke, selfie no.1.' But despite its jokey nature, the snap did encourage her when she realised she did not want to look like that any more. 'After I had my children almost seven years ago, I completely lost control of everything and put on quite a lot of weight.' If she was tempted by chocolate, Eva scrolled back through her pictures as reminder of how far she'd come . An added factor was the fact that she did not have the energy for her children, Eva and Agust, any more. She would prioritise easy access to food over being active and physical with them on the weekends. 'It was like I didn't do anything unless I got to eat at the same time,' she admitted. Eva measured her year-long slimdown which she documented with her 'embarrassing' selfies . As the weight dropped off, Eva's brother was even able to pick her up for the first time since she was 18 . 'For me, food was a drug. I never ate just one little chocolate piece, it was always something more. 'The first two or three days of the diet were a bit difficult, but since then I've been so stable, floating around on a pink cloud. 'I was more energetic and could easily get up in the morning. The mental recovery was so much that I thought I had already lost 60 kilos (9st) in February, even though it was still a long way to go. 'I felt better as all kinds of physical pain disappeared.' She added that she is no longer anxious about going abroad, when she was always wondering if she would fit into the airplane seat or if she'd need a seatbelt extension. 'I still find it painful to look at the first few selfies from last year, but I always feel better looking at the end of the year.' Eva's diet involved cutting out certain food groups like wheat, and she posted snaps of her meals online .","At 19st 2lb, mother-of-two from Iceland had no energy for her children .

"Since Google began in 1998, it has become the most popular search engine in the world, launched the ubiquitous Android software, and even offers its own superfast broadband network. And along the way it has also spent billions on technology startups and websites. A designer has created an infographic showing the firm’s most expensive acquisitions, and the strategy behind these purchases - as well as predicting which companies the tech giant could buy next. The graphic (pictured) plots Google’s 10 most expensive acquisitions and the year the purchase was made. The cheapest, relatively speaking, was for  SkyBox Imaging, in June last year. In ninth place is Dropcam, bought for $555 million (£366 million) also in June 2014 . The graphic was designed by Bedford-based website developers Aptitude. It plots Google’s top 10 acquisitions, from the least to the most expensive, the year the purchase was made, and how the technology complements Google’s existing products. Over the past 16 years, Google has spent $24.5 billion on 10 companies alone – and that doesn’t include smaller purchases, as well as investments. The cheapest acquisition, relatively speaking, was for satellite imaging experts SkyBox Imaging, in June last year. The deal was said to be worth $500 million (£330 million) and Aptitude believes Google bought the company to obtain accurate and up-to-date images for its Google Maps and Street View services. In ninth place is Dropcam, bought for $555 million (£366 million) also in June last year. The SkyBox Imaging deal was said to be worth $500 million (£330 million) and Aptitude believes Google bought the company to obtain accurate and up-to-date images (pictured) for its Google Maps and Street View services . In eight place on the top 10 list is Postini. This email and web security service cost Google $625 million (£413 million) in July 2007. ITA Software was Google’s seventh most expensive acquisition, at $700 million in July 2010. It develops software for the travel industry. At six, Google bought mobile platform AdMob in 2009 . SpaceX announced today that is has raised $1 billion (£659 million in funding from Google and Fidelity Investments. The firms own just under 10 per cent of Elon Musk's space exploration firm. The deal values the company at $10bn. Elon Musk said the money would go towards innovation in space transport and satellite manufacturing. The video monitoring and security company was bought to complement another of Google’s top 10 acquisitions - second place NestLabs. NestLabs cost Google $3.2 billion (£2.1 billion) in January last year. The company makes smart themostats and smoke detectors and was set up by Tony Fadell, dubbed ‘the father of the iPod.’ Nest and Dropcam both help Google develop its strategy to connect people’s smart homes. In eight place on the top 10 list is Postini. This email and web security service cost Google $625 million (£413 million) in July 2007. Google had previously used the service to help secure its Gmail service. In September 2011, Google announced plans to retire Postini, and many of the services were added to Google Apps from August 2012. The service officially shutdown last year, but all existing customers will transition over by 15 March this year. GPS navigation app Waze was Google’s fifth priciest purchase, in June 2013. Waze (app pictured) reports now automatically appear on Google Maps’ traffic layers. It cost Google $966 million (£637 million) One of the most famous brands  Google has bought is YouTube. Bought back in 2006, the video sharing service now has more than 1 billion unique users each month, and more than 6 billion hours of video are watched a month on the site. It cost $1.65 billion (£1 million), but is said to make four times that a year . ITA Software was Google’s seventh most expensive acquisition, at $700 million in July 2010. It develops software for the travel and airline industry and was said to be ‘heavily relied’ upon by Google rival Bing. At six, Google bought mobile advertising platform AdMob in late 2009, although the deal wasn't fully complete until early 2010. Apple was also said to have been interested in buying the platform for its iOS software. GPS navigation app Waze was Google’s fifth priciest purchase, in June 2013. Waze reports now automatically appear on Google Maps’ traffic layers. The most expensive acquisition was made in 2011 for Motorola. Google was said to have wanted the firm’s patents. The deal cost  $12.5 billion (£8.2 billion), but in January 2014, Google sold it to Lenovo for $2.9 billion (£1.9 billion) - although did keep patents. NestLabs was in second place in 2014, worth $3.2 billion (£2 billion) Google was said to have wanted Motorola's patents to help design its own range of Nexus phones and tablets. The Nexus 6 (pictured), for example, is designed and made by Motorola . Looking to the future, Aptitude predicts Google could make a play for either Spotify, Netflix or both. Spotify is the largest music subscription based music service in the market. Meanwhile, Netflix has 50 million subscribers, but could end up costing Google $23 billion (£15 billion), based on its market value . It cost Google $966 million (£637 million). One of the most famous brands  Google has bought, and subsequently developed, is YouTube. Bought back in 2006, the video sharing service now has more than 1 billion unique users each month, and shows more than 6 billion hours of video a month - almost an hour for every person on Earth. It cost $1.65 billion (£1 million), but is said to make Google almost four times that a year in revenue. Another advertising company on the list is DoubleClick. Google bought the software, as well as its relationships with web publishers and other agencies as part of a deal said to have been worth $3.1 billion (£2 billion). Google could use Spotify (pictured) to bolster its music offered from Google Play. Spotify's music industry contacts, and relationships in particular, could prove useful. Google owns Songza and Spotify could rival this . Aptitude believes Netflix (picutred) could expand Google's video services, alongside YouTube . But, the most expensive acquisition was made in 2011 for phone manufacturer Motorola. Google was said to have wanted the firm’s patents to help design its own range of Nexus phones and tablets. The Nexus 6, for example, is designed and made by Motorola. The deal cost Google $12.5 billion (£8.2 billion), but in January last year Google sold it to Lenovo - although did keep a number of the patents. Looking to the future, Aptitude predicts Google could make a play for either Spotify, Netflix or both. Spotify is the largest music subscription-based music service in the market and Google could use it to bolster its current music offerings from Google Play. Google already owns Songza, and Spotify could rival this. Meanwhile, Netflix, with its 50 million subscribers and mobile reach, could be another good fit for Google. It is valued at $23 billion (£15 billion), which would make it Google’s most expensive acquisition to date. During the two years prior to 2014, Google spent more on acquisitions than five of its closest rivals put together, including Apple and Facebook. Google services 3.5 billion searches per day which equates to 1.2 trillion searches a year worldwide.","Since 1998, Google has spent $24.5 billion (£16.2 billion) on 10 companies .

"This is the dramatic moment that a gang used a 4X4 to ram-raid a Formula 1 team's headquarters and escaped with a haul of trophies. CCTV footage has been released by police of the crooks' using their car to reverse through the entrance of the Red Bull factory. Six masked raiders, some armed with shovels and sledgehammers, are then seen grabbing trophies from cabinet shelves before fleeing. Scroll down for video . This is the moment that ram-raiders used their car to smash their way into the headquarters of Formula 1 team Red Bull . Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner branded the theft at around 1.30am on December 6, 'a pointless crime.' The ram-raiders escaped with haul of around 60 trophies after crashing through the team's glass display cabinet. During the footage one of the raiders is even seen throwing throwing one of the trophies on to the floor. At the time of the raid a source close to the team revealed that many of the trophies were made of plastic and of no value. This meant that the thieves were not able to melt them down or sell them for scrap metal. The crooks reversed their Mercedes vehicles, using foreign number plates, to reverse through the entrance . Around 20 of the trophies were recovered after a member of the public spotted them dumped in Horseshoe Lake near Sandhurst, Berkshire. Officers from Thames Valley Police are due to make an appeal for information about the break-in on BBC1's Crimewatch programme tonight. Mr Horner, who is engaged to former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, said: 'It was a pointless crime, the value of which for these trophies is minimal in terms of raw material. A total of six masked men were behind the early morning break-in at the factory . 'But the emotional value is huge and it would be great to see those trophies back in their rightful home in Milton Keynes.' The Austrian team won the F1 constructors’ championship and drivers’ title from 2010 to 2013, while Sebastian Vettel won the drivers' championship for each of the four years. However the ram raiders, who used vehicles with foreign number plates, failed to get away with these trophies  as they had been passed on to this season's title winners Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton. Thieves were armed with shovels and sledgehammers and smashed their way into the floor to ceiling display cabinets . Red Bull staff were said to have been “absolutely devastated” by the theft of the trophies following years of work. Mr Horner has previously warned that the team would have to limit access to the site in future, accepting the move would disappoint fans. Raiders can be seen in the short clip throwing around the team's prized trophies as they emptied the display cabinet . One masked thief, pictured wearing all black, can be seen holding one of the team's gongs aloft . Red Bull team principal Christian Horner branded it a 'It was a pointless crime,' he said the value of the trophies was 'minimal in terms of raw material.' A picture taken at the scene shows the damage left by a 4x4 which smashed through the entrance of the factory . He said at the time: 'The actions of these men mean it's likely that we will have to make our site less accessible in the future, which will be unfair on the hundreds of fans that travel to visit our factory each year to see our trophies and our Formula One car. 'We would like to appeal to anyone who knows any information on the whereabouts of these trophies or the offenders involved to contact Thames Valley Police.'

"A teenager has used pieces of Lego to replicate models of Hitler and scenes of the Holocaust as part of a Second World War school history project. The 16-year-old pupil, from St Helens, Merseyside, decided to use the toy pieces to build a timeline of events of the war, instead of creating a simple poster. Upon finishing his creation, which was part of a GCSE history project, he uploaded a photograph of it to Reddit, where it has received more than 250,000 views and 1,000 comments. Scroll down for video . The 16-year-old pupil, from St Helens, Merseyside decided to use Lego to build a timeline of events of the Second World War, instead of creating a poster, for a GCSE history project to 'remember the holocaust' The unique Lego creation depicts various key events in the Holocaust and the rise and fall of Hitler and the Nazis. It starts in January 1933 with a depiction of Adolf Hitler being appointed the Chancellor of Germany . Upon finishing his creation, the teenager uploaded a photograph of it to Reddit, where it has since received more than 250,000 views and 1,000 comments. Pictured: Hitler is given emergency powers in February 1933 . Of his creation, the pupil said: 'As I'm not a very good drawer I thought why not do something I'm good at?' The student, who wished to remain anonymous, said the response had been overwhelming. He said: 'My history teacher set us a task to create something that will help people remember the Holocaust, as every history GCSE student in the country has to study it. 'I decided not to make a poster, but to make a timeline of events. This would help me to remember the dates better. 'As I'm not a very good drawer I thought why not do something I'm good at?' The Lego creation depicts various key events in the Holocaust and the rise and fall of Hitler and the Nazis. The timeline starts in January 1933 with a picture showing Adolf Hitler being appointed as Chancellor of Germany. He stands in front of a crowd of people with a Swastika behind him made out of red and white Lego bricks. This is followed by a scene from February 1933 which has the caption '40,000 SS and SAS men are sworn in as auxiliary police'. Another scene is captioned: 'The Reichstag is burned, probably by the Nazis'. Among other pieces in his unique creation are a depiction of the D-Day landings and the opening of Auschwitz. Upon finishing his creation, which was part of a GCSE school history project, the teenager uploaded a photograph of it to Reddit, where it has since received more than 250,000 views and 1,000 comments . He said his Lego project 'helped him remember dates of the war'. Pictured: Germany invading Poland in 1939 . One particular scene in his Lego creation is captioned: 'The Reichstag is burned, probably by the Nazis' Among other pieces in his creation are a depiction of the D-Day landings and the opening of Auschwitz . The boy's headteacher said his work had not yet been formally assessed but said the school was impressed with his 'Lego building' skills and the time he committed to the project. His work will be marked in due course . The timeline ends with a Lego model of Hitler lying on a Swastika with the caption: 'Hitler commits suicide'. The pupil has also included a photograph alongside his creation, showing the desk he used while piecing together all of the Lego scenes. After completing it, he uploaded it to online site Reddit with the heading: 'I made a Lego timeline of the Holocaust for a school history project.' It quickly prompted more than 1,000 comments and hundreds of thousands of views. He said: 'I'm pretty overwhelmed by the reaction online; there's been a huge variance in what people think about it. 'Usually my photos and creations get a few hundred views, so it was certainly a surprise to wake up to 275,000 views.' The pupil, who wishes to remain anonymous, said : 'My history teacher set us a task to create something that will help people remember the Holocaust. I decided to make a timeline.'

"Long-term use of hormonal contraceptives can double the risk of brain cancer, a study has found. But scientists stressed that the likelihood of any individual woman developing the disease was in reality extremely small. Researchers used health data from Denmark to compare 317 women diagnosed with glioma, a type of brain tumour, and 2,126 who were free of the disease. All were aged 15 to 49, and therefore young enough to be using contraceptives. Women who had ever used an oral contraceptive or hormone-releasing intra-uterine device (IUD), or coil, were 50 per cent more likely to develop brain cancer than those who had not. Risk: Long-term use of hormonal contraceptives can double the risk of brain cancer, Dutch scientists say . The difference in risk increased to 90 per cent, just under double, for women who had used one of the contraceptives for five years or more. Progestagen-only contraceptives were most strongly associated with glioma, raising the risk almost three-fold. In terms of cancer type, the risk was greatest for gliobastoma multiforme, the most aggressive type of primary brain tumour. Danish lead researcher Dr David Gaist, from Odense University Hospital and University of Southern Denmark, said: 'It is important to keep this apparent increase in risk in context. 'In a population of women in the reproductive age, including those who use hormonal contraceptives, you would anticipate seeing five in 100,000 people develop a glioma annually, according to the nationwide Danish Cancer Registry. 'While we found a statistically significant association between hormonal contraceptive use and glioma risk, a risk-benefit evaluation would still favour the use of hormonal contraceptives in eligible users.' The findings are reported in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. The hormone progesterone is known to increase proliferation of high-grade glioma cells called astrocytomas in the laboratory. It is also thought to raise levels of growth factors, natural substances that stimulate cell growth. But the scientists said it was impossible to form any conclusions about how progesterone-containing contraceptives might influence brain cancer development. Experts commenting on the results emphasised the importance of keeping them in perspective. Sir David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University, said: 'Glioma is fortunately very rare. Hormones: Women who had ever used an oral contraceptive or hormone-releasing intra-uterine device (IUD - pictured), or coil, were 50 per cent more likely to develop brain cancer than those who had not . 'Even if oral contraceptives did increase the risk to the extent suggested by this study, it would only mean one extra glioma each year for every 50,000 women taking the pill. 'Suppose, however, all these women changed to a less effective form of contraception and 10,000 of them got pregnant: we would then expect one extra mother and 40 extra babies to die.' Statistician Professor Kevin McConway, from The Open University, said: 'Previous scares about possible increased health risks from contraceptive pills have had bad consequences for public health. 'On hearing that taking the Pill might lead to an increased risk of certain diseases, some women switched away from the Pill to less reliable forms of contraception, or none at all. 'That increased numbers of abortions, and exposed the women to health risks from pregnancy and abortion that were generally far greater than any reduction in risk from the diseases in the scare. 'Brain tumours are not at all common. 'So even if long-term pill use does double the risk, well, twice a very small risk is still a very small risk.' Cancer: In terms of cancer type, the risk was greatest for gliobastoma multiforme (pictured), the most aggressive type of primary brain tumour . Paul Pharoah, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Cambridge, said: 'It is important to remember that association does not necessarily imply causation. 'This type of study is particularly prone to bias as it relies on routine data and information on other possible risk factors was not available. 'It may be that pill use is simply correlated with another important risk factor. 'Moreover, the findings are somewhat contrary to the findings of other studies which have reported either no association or a small reduction in risk of brain tumours associated with oral contraceptive pill use.' He added: 'Even if the results are taken at face value the findings have limited implications for women who take the pill. 'The chance of a woman developing a brain cancer in he lifetime is approximately 5 in 1000. This would be increased to just 8 in a thousand. 'The oral contraceptive pill has many other beneficial effects. 'For example, a 20-year-old woman who takes the oral contraceptive for ten years will reduce her chance of getting ovarian cancer by about 15 in 1000. 'A much bigger reduction than any possible increase in the risk of brain cancer. 'Women should not base their decision on whether or not to take the contraceptive pill on the results of this study.'","Women who'd ever used an oral contraceptive or hormone-releasing intra-uterine device (IUD), or coil, were 50% more likely to develop brain cancer .

"To look at her, Scott Engstrom would appear to be just a white-haired elderly woman, a grandmother to nine - and the last person in the world you’d expect to cross the world chasing a dream. That was until the day two years ago when a chance glimpse at a TV programme made her jump out of her chair. Scott, 71, is horse-mad, and has been fascinated with  one particular breed since she was a little girl: the Appaloosa, descendants of the horses ridden by  the Nez Perce tribe of American Indians. Scroll down for video . Scott Engstrom, 71, traveled across Asia in search of the Appaloosa horse, a rare breed with mottled skin . Appaloosas are beautiful, famed for their myriad coat patterns, mottled skin, striped hooves, eerily human-looking eyes, and a graceful one-foot-on-the-ground gait, known as the Indian shuffle. It was thought that there were fewer than 200 true Appaloosas left in the world as cross-breeding has threatened their integrity. On her ranch in New Zealand, Scott has been breeding the real McCoy since 1996. But on one fateful Sunday in 2012, Scott settled down to watch what she thought was going to be an old movie, Around The World In 80 Days. Instead it  was a repeat of Channel 4 series, Around The World In 80 Trades, in which former City analyst Conor Woodman travelled the globe buying and selling local commodities. The series, which first aired six years ago, showed him horse-trading in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan. Conor Woodman joined Scott on her quest after she saw him horse-trading in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan on the Channel 4 program Around the World in 80 Trades . ‘And then I stood up in my lounge and screamed my head off...’ recalled Scott. For the horse that Conor had bought and called Martin was surely an Appaloosa. ‘He had everything an Appaloosa should have. I was sure of it.’ Most breeders would say that Appaloosas arrived in Mexico with the Spanish conquistadors and made their way north. But American-born Scott always believed they came from Asia across the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia, and that’s why there were so many in the Pacific North West, the home of the Nez Perce tribe. ‘I thought, “I’ve got to get hold of this guy! I’ve got to convince him that he needs to go with me to Kyrgyzstan and find that horse.”’ A flurry of emails followed. ‘I’m not crazy,’ Scott assured Conor, who lives in London. ‘I’m just trying to keep a wonderful breed alive – I need to find Martin.’ If they succeeded,she argued, then DNA tests might prove her theory about the breed’s origins. Conor was intrigued. So that was how Scott came to be flying to Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, before setting off across Central Asia to make a film, Secret Horse: Quest For The True Appaloosa, shown on BBC4 tonight. Scott is looking into importing horses from Kyrgyzstan to New Zealand where she lives . She hadn’t met Conor until she arrived, but she didn’t have a moment’s trepidation. ‘I was just so excited, so ready to go!’ Her family, however – three grown-up daughters and a son – thought differently. Her youngest daughter Canada, 28, said, ‘How can you even think about it? You have grandchildren who will never know their grandmother!’ She said: ‘The last words I heard at the airport from my grandson – he’s the son of my other daughter, Summer – were, “Auntie Canada says you’re going to die!”’ But Scott is fiercely individual. Five-times married (her first marriage lasted only a day, number four lasted three months) refuses to stand any nonsense from husbands. ‘I wish I’d married a cowboy,’ she said. ‘I’m so horsey and none of my husbands were.’ Nor was this her first big adventure. Scott was in her 50s when she moved from her remote home in Idaho to New Zealand. She was accompanied by two daughters, three horses including an Appaloosa mare, two old English sheepdogs, a boat, a pick-up truck and a horse trailer. ‘We came to New Zealand sight unseen. So that was an adventure!’ Filmmaker Conor hadn’t a clue that Martin was special when, as one of his 80 Trades, he bought him for the equivalent of £610 from local breeder Munarbek Kuldanbaev. After an unsuccessful day trying to hack it as a horse dealer, he sold him on to a farmer for £500. But when Conor and Scott tracked down that farmer, with Munarbek’s help, it turned out Martin had been sold a month later to a man in the same village. Then he’d been sold again, this time at market to an unknown buyer. An Appaloosa horse with its distinctive black spotted white coat in a farm in Wexford, Ireland . They’d reached a dead end. ‘I was so upset, I cried for three days,’  Scott said. Appaloosas in the US cost up to $100,000 (£64,000). Scott has  refused an offer of $150,000 (£99,000) for her stallion Eagleheart. But this wasn’t about money. Her dream was that by breeding from the purest Appaloosas in the world, she could strengthen the bloodline. They had a stroke of luck when they attended an ancient horse game called kok-boru, Kyrgyzstan’s national sport. Like polo, highly skilled riders compete to drag a goat carcass into goal. There they learned about a remote valley where there were horses that sounded like Appaloosas. They spent three days driving, then onwards on horseback, sleeping rough in wolf country. At 4,200m Scott was clearly suffering from altitude sickness, though she insists it was just the flu. But then came the moment that made it all worthwhile: the first sighting of a herd of what were clearly Appaloosas.  ‘It was so wonderful. I was so relieved to know they existed,’ she said. Locally, the horses are known as chaar, which means spotted. Their nomadic owners said that during the Soviet regime, the Russians tried to eradicate them by cross-breeding; but in this remote valley they survived. Their owners let them be DNA tested, but Scott was already convinced, ‘I thought, “Here’s the true Appaloosa!”’ Her instincts were confirmed when Conor turned up in New Zealand with the DNA results. True Appaloosa, indeed. ‘I knew it!’ said Scott. But she isn’t done yet. She’s looking into importing horses from Kyrgyzstan to New Zealand. ‘Spending the kids’ inheritance,’ she said cheerfully. ‘I want to go back and pick out three good mares. I’ve got 20 more years in me, at least.","Scott Engstrom 71, traveled to Kyrgyzstan in search of rare horse breed .

"An 11-year-old boy with a rare brain disease has come one step closer to fulfilling his dream of meeting Pirates of the Caribbean character Captain Jack Sparrow. At the London premier of his latest Hollywood blockbuster, Mortdecai, Johnny Depp was heard wishing Jed Baker, who was diagnosed with Moyamoya, a disease that causes the blood vessels in his brain to constrict, to: 'get well soon, brother.' When asked if the pirate obsessed fan from Ravenshoe in far north Queensland could come visit his Gold Coast film set for the fifth movie in the series, Depp responded 'Absolutely, it's easy!'. Scroll down for video . Captain Jed: An 11-year-old boy who suffers from a rare brain disease, dreams of meeting his idol Johnny Depp . In a recent red carpet appearance for the blockbuster Mortdecai, Depp issued Jed Baker a 'get better' message and when asked if the boy could visit his Queensland film set, said 'absolutely, it's easy' Jed's mother Nicola Baker told Daily Mail Australia that her son was so excited by the footage that he 'watched it four times in a row and went into a 'pirate frenzy' so far that I had to draw a mascara moustache on him that he refused to wash off'. The mother-of-three said her eldest son's love for Captain Sparrow grew during the long hours he spent in hospital recovering from multiple surgeries to treat his rare condition. At only 11-years-old, Jed has undergone a renal artery bypass and three separate brain surgeries in which four sections of his brain were operated on. 'His prognosis now is that he's palatable - that doesn't mean he's going to die, but it means there are no other surgical interventions they can do,' Ms Baker said. Jed's mother, Nicola Baker (pictured with her three children) started a social media campaign to spread awareness for Moyamoya and help her son meet his idol . She said her eldest son's love for the actor grew during his long stint in hospital, recovering from multiple surgeries. Jed repeatedly watched the Pirates of the Caribbean series during his recovery . 'He believes in his mind that he is Jack Sparrow. He has a Black Pearl and he can sit on it and it has Captain Jed written on it,' Ms Baker said . 'If he has another bleed or a stroke, then there's a very real chance Jed won't be with us. We are hopeful that he reaches adulthood, but we understand that he might not.' At only 11-years-old, Jed has undergone a renal artery bypass and three separate brain surgeries in which four sections of his brain were operated on . Jed first suffered a stroke when he was only 11-months-old, sending his parents into panic. 'It was horrible; we didn't know what was going on. He started to twitch down the side of his face and body and it turned into one side of his body having a level of paralysis. His face was droopy, his arm wouldn't work and he could barely walk,' Ms Baker said. 'After another 12 months the twitch happened again and we found out that the brain disease had gotten to his kidneys as well, so he had a double whammy.' In an effort 'to make every day more awesome' for Jack, who Ms Baker described as a happy boy who laughs daily and loves playing with his dog and pet goat, she began a social media campaign to help her pirate-loving child meet his idol. 'We spent hours watching Jack Sparrow, Jed has always been very fixated on pirates. He believes in his mind that he is Jack Sparrow. He has a Black Pearl and he can sit on it and it has Captain Jed written on it,' Ms Baker said. 'I started the Facebook page because of the announcement that the Pirates franchise was going to be filming two hours away from my house– I try to make magic happen for my kids wherever I can and I thought ""his idol is going to be right on my doorstep – I have to grab this opportunity with two hands!"". 'I started the Facebook page because of the announcement that the Pirates franchise was going to be filming two hours away from my house– I try to make magic happen for my kids wherever I can and I thought ""his idol is going to be right on my doorstep – I have to grab this opportunity with two hands!"",' Ms Baker said . MS Baker said her son was so excited by the footage that he 'watched it four times in a row and went into a 'pirate frenzy' so far that I had to draw a mascara moustache on him that he refused to wash off' 'Jed's illness is very lonely and isolating for us as family, but also disheartening for friends because there's nothing tangible they can do to help, so I used the group as a way to involve family and friends.' The group's members have started the hashtag #‎piratejedtomeetpiratejack and have been emailing and tweeting celebrities in an effort to raise awareness for Moyamoya disease and possibly get Jed closer to meeting Depp. It has attracted the attention of supporters overseas including a man calling himself Tell Tale Turtle, who attends red carpet events to advocate for sick children around the world and managed to get a quick video clip of Depp greeting Jed and wishing him the best for his health.

"Police have released nearly 200 images of looters who ransacked a Ferguson grocery store the night it emerged that a grand jury would not indict the officer who shot dead Michael Brown. The photographs and footage showing 180 suspects were released by St Louis County police on Wednesday to ask the public for help identifying the people inside the store. The group descended on Dellwood Market on December 24 after authorities announced that Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson would not be charged over killing Brown, 18, in August. The decision sparked protests and widespread looting across the area, with some people setting fire to vehicles and businesses and raiding their shelves for items. Scroll down for video . Looters: Police in Missouri have released images showing people breaking in to a St Louis-area store in November after authorities announced that Darren Wilson would not be indicted for killing Michael Brown . Do you know them? Images clearly show the people breaking into the convenience store on November 24 . Destruction: The group broke in after smashing down a flimsy wall and pouring into the store . In the footage, a small group of people can be seen trying to break into the store by yanking the handle and then by using a crowbar to bust down the door. After two minutes of failing to get into the store, some males smash through a flimsy wall - and suddenly crowds of looters stream inside. For several minutes, they rush into the store and crowd the aisles, grabbing items and pushing past each other before leaving the store with their arms full. While some of the looters covered their faces with  masks and others hid behind hoods or hats, many of them are clearly identifiable in the footage. It is the third time police have released photos and surveillance video in an effort to track down those responsible for looting in and around Ferguson. Earlier this month, they released surveillance images from Phillips 66 and so far the public has helped identify five of the suspects, KSDK reported. Hidden: Some of the looters hid behind hoods or masks as they entered the convenience store . Wreckage: The store was targeted three times by looters and the owner has said he will not re-build again . Taking their time: Looters stroll into the store after the group smashed down the thin wall, seen right . Thieves: Some of the looters filled their arms with goods before fleeing and now police are looking for them . About a week later, they released surveillance images from looting at Crazy Deals and Rehoboth Pharmacy. A dozen Ferguson-area businesses were destroyed in fires and many other businesses were damaged in looting in the hours following the announcement. It was the third time that Dellwood Market was hit amid the uproar over Brown's killing. It was also targeted in August when looters shot off the locks, entered the store and started a fire. The store's owner, Mumtaz Lalani, told Fox that he was looted twice in August and it cost him between $50,000 and $100,000 to rebuild after each incident. He said that following the November attack, he would not be rebuilding his store.

"He's already spent £125,000 on his quest for the perfect face and body but despite having had liposuction, multiple nose jobs and a set of pec implants, Rodrigo Alves, 30, is still not satisfied. Now the Brazilian flight attendant has revealed that he is to have rhinoplasty for the fourth time - but will have to travel to the Middle East to have the operation after being unable to find a surgeon closer to home. Alves, who describes his nose as 'totally botched', will travel to Dubai for the surgery which will be performed by a doctor from Iranian capital, Tehran. Scroll down for video . More work: Rodrigo Alves, 30, is to have his fourth nose job but will have to travel to Dubai for the operation . 'There is lots wrong with my wrong with my nose,' says the London-based 30-year-old. 'It's totally botched.' But, after failing to find a doctor in his usual surgery destinations London, Miami and LA, he was pleased and surprised to find an alternative in Iran. 'I have found this amazing doctor based in Iran,' he says excitedly. 'Apparently Iran is the country where people do the most nose jobs. 'He guaranteed that he could give me my dream nose and said he can perform the surgery in Dubai which is much better because, as you know, I do most of my shopping in Dubai.' Alves is no stranger to surgery and has already had 24 cosmetic operations at a total cost of £125,000. Along with regular Botox injections, he has spent £30,000 on three nose jobs, £20,000 on a surgical six pack and £3,000 on having his calves reshaped. Botched: Alves says his nose is 'botched' after the three operations he has already had failed to deliver . Extensive: Alves, a flight attendant, has spent the last decade remodelling his body . Not happy: Alves, pictured before his transformation, says he felt unattractive and was left miserable . He has also spent £8,000 on having self-designed pec implants put in place and another £9,000 on two rounds of liposuction. Just before Christmas, he splashed out another £5,000 on a hair transplant designed to fix his receding hairline. The latter, however, doesn't really count according to Alves, who says looking like he does requires 'continuous maintenance'. 'There was always going to be a need for continuous maintenance once I started on this journey,' he explains. 'There's always going to be things that you need to get topped up and done.' Work: Alves has become something of a champion for surgery and appears on Channel 4's Bodyshockers . Painful process: Alves says having so much surgery is all part of his journey and part of who he is . Expensive habit: On top of surgery costs, Alves spends £200 a month on lotions, gadgets and pills . Alves' quest for the perfect face and body began 10 years ago when he moved to London and felt himself to be unattractive in comparison with the people he met. 'I was surrounded by beautiful and trendy people but I felt like I wasn't welcome in their circles,' he explains. 'I am completely aware that I am far from perfection. I'm not deluded and I know I'm not the most good-looking guy. I'm just aiming to be the best that I can possibly be.' Luckily for Alves, a massive inheritance from his grandfather provided the funds to set about achieving his aim, beginning with a nose job. Since then, the 30-year-old has completely remodelled his body, although he admits that his bulging biceps and sculpted six-pack could have been created by exercising. 'Basically I don't like going to the gym,' he explains. 'I just don't like it. My time is valuable and I need it to catch up on my sleeping and do other things. 'I do my muscle toning in my spare time when I'm here in my bedroom lounging or watching a film.' Alves, who spends £200 a month on pills, gadgets and lotions, also owns a tooth whitening machine and happily admits that everything about him is artificial. 'I'm artificially made,' he says cheerfully.  'If you look at my chest it’s all made of silicone.' Not all of his procedures have gone to plan however, most notably a recent bid to have his biceps boosted, that left him in agony after he developed an infection. 'I was lucky to be alive,' he says. 'I regretted [that operation] badly. I was crying all day. It was traumatic... It was really was very bad.' Nevertheless, with another operation planned, the experience doesn't seem to have put him off cosmetic surgery. 'I don't think that I will really regret anything in the future,' he says. 'I really believe that everything I've done to myself was an investment. 'It is exhausting, it is expensive, it is time consuming but it is who I am and it is a long journey. Once you start, stopping is very difficult.'","Brazilian Rodrigo Alves has spent £125,000 on 24 cosmetic surgeries .

"Former Minnesota Gophers quarterback Philip Nelson has agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge stemming from a fight that left another former football player with a serious brain injury, his attorney said Tuesday. Nelson had been charged with two felonies relating to the May 11 fight with former Minnesota State, Mankato, linebacker Isaac Kolstad. But Nelson will now enter a guilty plea to fifth-degree assault, which carries a maximum jail sentence of 90 days, his attorney James Fleming said. No date has been scheduled for the plea hearing. Former Minnesota Gophers quarterback Philip Nelson has agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge stemming from a fight that left another former football player with a serious brain injury, his attorney said Tuesday . Nelson will now enter a guilty plea to fifth-degree assault, which carries a maximum jail sentence of 90 days, his attorney James Fleming said. No date has been scheduled for the plea hearing . Fleming said three doctors had reported a 'lack of medical certainty' as to whether Nelson's kick caused Kolstad's critical brain injury, so Fleming filed a motion for dismissal of the charges. Instead, a plea agreement was reached and the two felony assault charges will be dismissed, Fleming said. A forensic pathologist hired by the defense said an initial punch allegedly thrown by another defendant most likely caused Kolstad's injuries. Witnesses told investigators that Nelson shoved Kolstad, a 2013 graduate, after mistaking him for a bouncer who had kissed his girlfriend. Kolstad knocked Nelson to the ground, but as he walked away, a third man punched Kolstad in the head. Surveillance video shows Kolstad dropping to the ground and his head smacking the pavement. Nelson then kicked Kolstad in the head. Trevor Shelley, of St. Peter, is accused of punching Kolstad in the head and is charged with assault. Kolstad suffered from a severe brain injury that required emergency surgery. Doctors once feared he wouldn't live, but he spent months recovering at Mayo Clinic and a specialized rehab facility in the Twin Cities. A forensic pathologist hired by the defense said an initial punch allegedly thrown by another defendant most likely caused Kolstad's injuries . He has returned home to Mankato, attends outpatient therapy and is able to walk, run and form complete sentences. He hopes to eventually return to work at Fastenal, where he was a sales representative. Nelson, 21, said in a statement Tuesday that he's remorseful. 'I still don't remember what happened that night after I was hit in the head, but I recognize that I let down my family and friends by my actions. I offer my sincere apologies to everyone involved, and I wish Isaac Kolstad the best as he continues in his recovery,' Nelson said. Nelson didn't respond to a message left with his parents Tuesday. In an interview with WCCO-TV that aired Monday, before the plea agreement was announced, Nelson said he had been working out with a trainer in hopes of resuming his football career. Kolstad declined comment through his attorney Kenneth White, who said the Kolstad family was disappointed with the plea agreement. 'This case is not simply about a kick in the head. It's a series of decisions Mr. Nelson made,' White said, including underage drinking, becoming intoxicated and 'accosting Mr. Kolstad.' White said he expected civil lawsuits to be filed in the future against the defendants.","Former Minnesota Gophers quarterback Philip Nelson had been charged with two felonies relating to the May 11 fight with former Minnesota State, Mankato, linebacker Isaac Kolstad .

"A primary school teacher kissed a 15-year-old girl in a classroom cupboard and engaged in sex acts with her and another teenager in his car, a court heard. Jonathan Norbury, 33, is accused of sexually touching two teenage girls as well 'inciting' the pair to perform sex acts on him. Swansea Crown Court was told he would sneak the 15-year-old, who can not be named for legal reasons, into his classroom after school and take her into the stationery cupboard where he asked to see her underwear. Jonathan Norbury, pictured arriving at court with his wife, is accused of sexually touching two teenage girls as well 'inciting' the pair to perform sex acts on him . As well as letting the secondary school student into the classroom through the fire exit, the girl claims she would creep out of her house in the middle of the night, where they would perform sex acts on one another. The girl, who is now an adult, said: 'We would go into the cupboard, he would normally ask me to show him my underwear which I would. 'Then he would say something sexual, and then we would start kissing.' The girl claims her sexual relationship with Norbury started not long after she turned 15 when he allegedly texted her to say she looked 'hot'. Recalling the message, she said: 'I was quite shocked to start with but also quite pleased....pleased because I thought he was good-looking and an older man.' The woman said she had bought a second phone to keep in contact with Norbury, and would send Norbury photographs of herself in her underwear. During their secret meetings in his car, she said they would kiss and touch each other's genitals. Swansea Crown Court (pictured) was told Norbury would sneak the 15-year-old into his classroom after school and take her into the stationery cupboard where he asked to see her underwear . 'After I turned 16, it seemed that he sort of lost interest,' she said. The pair later kept in touch via phone, with a jury hearing that Norbury told his future wife about his relationship with her. The witness said: 'I told him ""I bet you didn't tell her how old I was"". I then heard what sounded like crying. I never heard from him again.' During cross-examination, defence QC Elwen Evans questioned the witness's account of the text message Norbury allegedly sent. The court heard the woman had written about the alleged text on her personal organiser - and the note was dated. But Miss Evans asked whether you could put any date in the organiser and 'backdate it'. The witness agreed that this was possible to do. Norbury admits having mutual sexual relations with both girls, but denies the charges against him, insisting that the relationships took place only when the girls were aged 16 or over . After telling the jury she had used the organiser off and on for around a year, Miss Evans asked why there were only two entries on it. 'There were all sorts of things that you said Jonathan said and did after that ... none of which you have noted on your organiser,' Miss Evans said. The QC also asked the witness: 'Did you want some form of revenge (on Norbury)?' She replied: 'No. I have got no reason to.' Another alleged victim claims she was also in a relationship with Norbury when she was 15 - with the teacher taking her to beauty spots in his car, where they would have 'sexual contact'. She alleges that she and Norbury, a devout Christian, continued their relationship until she was around 19, but she agreed to keep their trysts a secret as it might affect Norbury's respected position at a local church. She says she lost her virginity to Norbury a few weeks after her 16th birthday, having met him in early 2005, but said they had engaged in sexual contact before then. However, she told the court she could not remember exactly when the relationship had started, or when the sexual activity began. She also said Norbury contacted her in 2012 to apologise 'for everything that happened' ahead of him getting married. Earlier in the trial, she told the jury that her decision to break her silence was not motivated by jealousy. During cross-examination, the woman was asked how she felt when their relationship ended. She said: 'Did I accept the relationship was over? No. I would phone him and text him. 'Do I accept that I would text him 30 or 40 times a day? I could have done. 'Two years after the break-up was I still trying to get back with Jonathan? Yes.' But the woman insisted it was the police who contacted her about Norbury after detectives began investigating allegations involving him and the other 15-year-old. She said: 'My job is working with vulnerable children under the age of 16. The reason why I brought this up (to police) was if I thought one of my children were being sexually abused or groomed by an older man, then I would want something done about it. That's the reason why I brought this (up to police). 'I would have never have brought the case against him... it was the police who approached me.' Norbury admits having mutual sexual relations with both girls, but denies the charges against him, insisting that the relationships took place only when the girls were aged 16 or over. Neither of the women were his pupils. Neither the church Norbury was a member of and the primary school he was working at the time of the alleged offences can be revealed for legal reasons. A judge has also issued an order preventing the media from naming the address where Norbury currently resides. The case continues.

"Microsoft was left red-faced over Christmas when its Xbox One service was infiltrated by hackers, and now its facing a similar problem. Reports on a German website claim that a list of 1,800 Microsoft-owned Minecraft's usernames and passwords have been published online. With access to these details, a security expert warns that criminals could break into accounts, change settings and buy virtual items. The hack was reported by Heise Online, and many of the verified accounts (selection pictured) are believed to belong to German gamers. It is not known how the hackers got their hands on the credentials, but security analyst Graham Cluely wrote : 'Possibilities range from phishing attacks, malware, or even a security breach' The hack was reported by Heise Online, and many of the verified accounts are believed to belong to German gamers. It is not known how the hackers got their hands on the credentials, but security analyst Graham Cluely wrote on the Hot for Security blog: 'Possibilities range from simple phishing attacks, keylogging malware stealing players’ details as they log into the game, or even a security breach at Minecraft itself. 'Let’s hope it’s not the last one - because the game has over 100 million registered users.' However, a Microsoft spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can confirm that no Mojang.net service was compromised. 'Normal industry procedures for dealing with situations like this were put in place to reset passwords for the small number of affected accounts.' Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a character is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.' They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape. Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available. He added that when the company discovers lists gamertags, usernames and passwords posted online, it takes 'immediate action to protect  customers by reviewing valid credentials and resetting account access when necessary.' Based on the huge number of registered users, the hack is relatively small. But, as Mr Cluely pointed out: 'If unauthorised users exploited the exposed email addresses and passwords they could not only log into other people’s gameworlds, but also download a full version of the game which normally sells for €19.95 Euros ($26.95 or £17.95).' Plus, once a cybercriminal has access to a person's email address they could use it hack other accounts, send spam or spread malware. Mr Cluely additionally said there is no guarantee that the hacker who released this current list also doesn't have more 'in their back pocket.' Microsoft bought Mojang in September in a deal said to be worth $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion). The game is available on PCs, Android, iOS and Windows Phone, as well as games consoles including the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. However, a Microsoft spokesman told MailOnline that no Mojang.net service was compromised. Although the number of released details is a small percentage of the game's 100 million user base, Mr Cluely said there is no guarantee the hacker who released this current list doesn't have more 'in their back pocket' At the start of the game, a character is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.' They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape. Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials. More than 16,645,000 people have bought the game, so far, and it is an online phenomenon.

"Labour MP Jim Dobbin died in September this year after drinking too many shots during an alcohol-fulled dinner while on a political trip in Poland . MP Jim Dobbin died after drinking a huge quantity of shots during an alcohol-fuelled meal while on a political trip to Poland, an inquest has heard. The stalwart Labour politician was at a banquet laid on as part of a Council of Europe trip to Slupsk when he was invited to drink a shot of spirit with every course. The practice - said to be a Polish tradition - caused the 73-year-old to be five times over the legal drink-drive limit. After the lavish evening meal, Mr Dobbin - a former microbiologist who had served an an MP since 1997 -  complained of feeling ill. He went to bed after being told by colleagues to 'sleep it off'. But, when his wife Patricia was unable to wake her unconscious husband, she raised the alarm. The father-of-four, who also had eight grandchildren, was taken to hospital just after midnight on  September 7 last year, but died less than one hour after being admitted. The Council of Europe trip had been to mark the town being awarded the council's 2014 Europe Prize for 'promoting the European ideal'. Other British politicians on the trip included former Deputy PM John Prescott and Labour MP Alan Meale. At an inquest into his death in Rochdale, the court heard how Mr Dobbin had died with food in his lungs. He also had a blood alcohol level of 399mg per 100ml -the legal limit is 50mg. The inquest heard how the MP, who represented Middleton and Heywood, never drank alcohol at home and only did so socially. When he did, he usually preferred beer rather than spirits. But Mrs Dobbin, who had been married to Mr Dobbin for 50 years, told the hearing how her husband had been invited to consume a shot of Polish spirit with each course - a tradition which was apparently customary for the occasion - by their hosts. Mrs Dobbin told how after the meal she went up to their room while her husband went to speak to Mr Meale. She said: 'He saw the MP Alan Meale and said he wanted to go over to him – so I went upstairs back to the hotel room. 'While he was downstairs he told some friends he began to feel dizzy so they brought him upstairs to the room at around 10.30pm. The stalwart backbencher, pictured with his wife Patricia at the 3005 Heywood and Middleton general election . 'Alan and two colleagues were with him and he (Jim) said ""What's all this about?"". His colleagues told him he just needed some sleep so I took off his tie and his shoes and was soon asleep.' During the inquest, Coroner Simon Nelson gave the cause of death was alcohol toxicity with food aspiration, which occurs when food blocks the body's respiration. He also recorded a conclusion of death by misadventure. Paying a warm tribute to Mr Dobbin, he said: 'When the Coroner's system was undergoing change a few years ago, he was one of a few MPs who responded to a letter I sent out – and when I met him I found him every bit as engaging as has been described. 'The area could not have wished for a more appropriate person to serve their needs. 'I believe he will be irreplaceable and I can't imagine any finer attributes than those described by those who knew him.' Mrs Dobbin added: 'He loved it (the visit to Poland) as he knew one or two people there who were involved with the pro-life movement as he was. He was having the perfect day.' She added: 'He never stopped – he was always busy and after he died, I had 940 cards of sympathy from all over the world. 'He was very sociable and outgoing and everything he set out to achieve in life, he achieved.' Mr Dobbin (left), who had served as an MP since 1997, pictured outside Downing Street with newlyweds Rhys and Esther Curnow (centre), David Burrows, Fiona Bruce, Dr Sharon James and Colin Hartm as part of the Coalition for Marriage (C4M) campaign . The MP, who had two daughters and two sons, was elected as a councillor to the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale council in 1983, where he became group leader in 1994. He was also a committed Roman Catholic and was made a papal knight by Pope Benedict in 2008. In parliament, Mr Dobbin chaired the Pro Life Committee and was also a member of the Involuntary Tranquillizer Addiction Group. He also sat on the Transport Scrutiny Select Committee. Some of his key moments in parliament included calling for integrated healthcare for the developing world to help prevent diseases spreading and to improve sanitation. He also voted against the same-sex marriage bill, commenting that MPs who voted for the change would 'rue the day' that they did so. Mr Dobbin was part of a delegation which had travelled to Slupsk (pictured) to mark the town being given the Council of Europe's 2014 Europe Prize for 'promoting the European ideal' Mr Dobbin was the local MP for Fusilier Lee Rigby, the soldier who was murdered in Woolwich, south-east London, last year. He said at the time that the death had ‘absolutely traumatised’ people in Fusilier Rigby's home town of Middleton, Greater Manchester. Mr Dobbin, the son of a coal miner, was born in Kincardine, in Fife. He went to Napier College, Edinburgh, where he studied bacteriology and virology, before working as a microbiologist for 33 years, 22 of which were for the Royal Oldham Hospital . At the time of Mr Dobbin's death, Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said it was a 'sad day for Parliament,' adding that Mr Dobbin was a 'dedicated public servant'. He had said: 'I will miss Jim's good friendship and decency. 'On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer our sincere condolences to his wife, Pat, and their children. We will all miss him.'","Labour MP was on political visit arranged by Council of Europe in Slupsk .

'Look,' he said, 'the person who is going to – and, and Secretary Clinton is really competent, capable person, and a friend – the person who is going to be the next President of the United States is the one who's going to be able to articulate the clearest vision to the American people of where they're going to take the country.' 'I think this is wide open on both sides,' he insisted. Biden ran for the presidency in 2008, announcing his candidacy by this point in the cycle eight years ago. But this time around he said he's in no hurry to declare. 'I don't think you have to make up your mind until the summer,' Biden explained, before pivoting back to his main job – promoting Obama's economic agenda in the wake of the annual speech before a joint session of Congress. 'Look, right now my focus is getting implemented what the president talked about last night – nail down this recovery, and get the middle class back in the game.' The vice president will resume his duties a White House cheerleader-in-chief Wednesday afternoon when he hosts a 5:00 p.m. conference call with supporters. The call, billed as an 'off the record' discussion but likely to be a freewheeling altar call for Obama, is being promoted by Organizing For Action, the group that was called Obama For America until after the president's re-election. Biden is 'going to discuss the plans President Obama laid out in the State of the Union last night,' the group said in an email to its list of millions, 'and give his take on what we can all do to help make progress this year.' He won't likely discuss his own presidential ambitions, however. ALSO ON THE BACK-BENCH: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a populist 'liberal's liberal' who insists she won't run, polls higher than Biden in some surveys . Biden is a bigger long-shot for the Democrats' nomination than most of the Republican field opposing them. In mid-December a Monmouth University poll put his national support in a primary fight at just 2 per cent. He hasn't polled higher than 14 per cent among Democrats – that was in a single late-December ABC News poll – and usually hovers in the high single-digits. The most recent major poll, from CNN and Opinion Research Corporation, puts him at 8 per cent, a single percentage point behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Clinton, however, wipes the floor with both of them: She attracted the support of 66 per cent of Demcorats in the poll.","Biden hasn't polled higher than 14 per cent among Democrats when they're asked to pick a horse for 2016 .

"Michelle Dodd (pictured) was convicted of assault for throwing water over her neighbour and her 'noisy' children . It started as a feud between two neighbours over the noise of children playing on a trampoline. Now the row has ended up in court – after one of the women threw water from an upstairs window which splashed over her neighbour’s children. Michelle Dodd, 38, was charged with assault following the long-standing dispute with next-door neighbour Afshan Iqbal. It began when Dodd complained about Mrs Iqbal’s four young children making too much noise while playing on a trampoline in the garden of their home in Reddish, Stockport. A court heard Dodd threw water out of her bedroom window three times, and on each occasion some of it landed on Mrs Iqbal, 33. Dodd denied assault, claiming she was bed-ridden with illness and was emptying a bowl of water put out for her cat, not intending to hit anyone. However, she was found guilty of all three counts. After the trial, she said: ‘It’s disgusting but there’s nothing I can do. I thought the court would laugh and sue the police for wasting everyone’s time.’ Stockport Magistrates’ Court heard the dispute began in December 2013 over noise made on the trampoline. Dodd argued that the garden toy should have been kept further away from her house. Both neighbours complained about the other, and the police had been called out before the water incidents, which happened last May. Speaking through an interpreter, Mrs Iqbal said some of the water hit her son, now aged three, which she claimed turned his dry skin condition into eczema. She said the trampoline had been moved after Dodd complained about the noise. But she added: ‘I can’t stop my two-year-old shouting or being loud. They are only children, they do what children do. I feel very sad.’ Dodd told the court: ‘I probably did shout at the kids to shut up, they were constantly shouting, screeching and throwing things.’ Chairman of the bench Jeffrey Stones gave Dodd a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered her to pay £280 costs. He told her: ‘You threw water out of the bedroom window not caring where it went.’ Last night, neighbours of the two women said they were shocked the matter had been taken to court and called for common sense to prevail. One, a 69-year-old man, said: ‘It’s absolutely preposterous that someone should be charged with assault and be given a criminal record for a dispute that simply got a bit out of hand. Dodd, who lived on this street, denied three counts of assault, claiming she was bed ridden with illness and was emptying a pan of water put out for her cat, not intending to hit anyone . ‘Throwing water is hardly like throwing a punch. Children are noisy and it is up to parents to ensure they don’t disturb the entire neighbourhood. ‘In this case that simply did not happen and they caused a lot of grief. ‘This lady should not have reacted the way she has, but police have been called on several occasions to keep the peace and now it has resulted in this.’ Another neighbour, a retired woman, said: ‘When three or more children get together they always cause such a din and these were no different. ‘But to charge someone with assault for throwing some water is plainly ridiculous and giving this woman a criminal record is only going to make matters worse. I think the council need to intervene and try to keep the peace between them. ‘Now she’s got a real grievance against her neighbour and I’m sure this is not going to be the last we hear of this matter.’ No one at Stockport Council was available yesterday to discuss the dispute. Dodd refused to comment last night, with a friend saying: ‘She doesn’t want to talk about it.’","Michelle Dodd, 38, was embroiled in dispute with Afshan Iqbal, 33 .

"A college student is still missing after he vanished in the middle of the night while on a surfing trip with friends. Scott Fippinger, 20, of San Diego, California, was at a campsite near campsite near Rosarito Beach in Mexico, just south of the American border, when he got up and left the tent at around 3:30a.m. last Wednesday morning. That is the last time anyone saw the young man. Vanished: Scott Fippinger (above) went missing while on a Mexican surfing trip with friends . Now, Scott's father, Eric Fippinger, is revealing that he and his wife believe their son likely fell to his death off one of the steep cliffs in the area. 'We are assuming that he went over the cliff, into the ocean and got swept out by the tide,' Eric told U-T San Diego. A friend says he saw Scott's light go on when he left the tent, and assumed the young man was going to the bathroom. The following day his phone and a piece of clothing possibly from his pajamas was found in the area between the tent and a nearby cliff. Assuming the worst: Scott's parents (Dad Eric and mom above) believe the young man may have fallen to his death off a cliff . There were unusually high winds that evening, and dirt on the side of the cliff seemed to show an impact spot the next day. High tide happened at 3:38am that morning as well, meaning Scott's body, had he fallen, would have quickly been taken out to sea. Now, his parents are just holding out hope that they can find their son's body. 'We are basically using all the resources we can and relying heavily on all the fishermen and local population to keep an eye out,' said Eric. A former pilot, Eric has now begun searching for his son from an aircraft.","Scott Fippinger of San Diego, California, vanished from his campsite at around 3:30am last Wednesday .

"A 33-year-old woman gave birth to a baby girl on a flight bound to New York from Jordan. A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says a nurse and doctor on the flight helped deliver the baby. Vera Jaber, a 32-year-old Jordanian, gave birth to the 6-pound, 5-ounce girl with nearly three hours left to fly before arriving at JFK airport, said Port Authority Spokesman Joe Pentangelo. Above the Atlantic: A woman aboard Jordanian Royal Airlines gave birth to a baby girl nearly three hours before landing at JFK airport  Tuesday evening . The birth happened over the Atlantic aboard Royal Jordanian Flight J261 at around 5 p.m. Tuesday. Mother and baby were taken to Jamaica Hospital in Queens after the aircraft landed at John F. Kennedy Airport around 7:30 p.m. Both appeared in good health though it was unclear how far along Jaber was in her pregnancy. Pentangelo says the woman is a citizen of Jordan and was traveling alone. This isn't the first time a woman has given birth aboard a flight in recent months. Just this past December, a Southwest Airlines flight from San Francisco to Phoenix had to make an emergency landing after a woman went into a labor and gave birth to a baby just minutes after takeoff. The flight was diverted to Los Angeles International Airport after the heavily pregnant mother began having contractions at 10,000 feet. An emergency room nurse and a doctor who happened to be aboard the flight delivered the child - with the help of a very rattled flight attendant. There were 111 people aboard the plane at the time. The woman, 32-year-old Vera Jaber, had been traveling alone. She and her little girl were rushed to Jamaica Hospital in Queens around 8pm.

"A 20-year-old student has been charged with setting fire to a classmate in his dorm then singing as he filmed her waking up engulfed in flames. Jaime Castano is said to have admitted to police that he took a video on his phone showing his drunk victim asleep in his bed as flames licked across her body. According to court papers, the video showed Castano singing as the 19-year-old woke up in agony and desperately tried to put out the blaze which had spread across her body. Charges: Former New York University student Jaime Castano has been charged with setting fire to a fellow student who fell asleep in his dorm room, then filmed and sang along to the moment she woke up in flames . The teenager suffered 'painful burns and scarring to her torso', it was alleged in a criminal complaint seen by the New York Daily News. Castano was arraigned yesterday on charges of assault and reckless endangerment in connection with the incident last August. He was held on a bond of £50,000 or $25,000 cash bail. The victim, a fellow student of Castano's at New York University, claims she and a third person were with Castano at his dorm room on Lafayette Street when she fell asleep at about 11pm on August 23, CBS New York reported. At around 6am the following the morning she woke to find holes and burn marks on her bed and blankets, burns on her clothes, and painful burns on her body, prosecutors told the broadcaster. But she wasn't aware of what caused the fire until she saw Castano's video, which he had shared with the photo-messaging application Snapchat, it is claimed. The victim reported the attack to university officials but they did not alert police until October 27 - more than two months after it allegedly occurred. An NYU spokesman would not comment on the delay when asked by the the New York Daily News, but did tell the paper that Castano was expelled in September over the alleged attack. The victim's identity has not been made public. Castano is due back on court on Friday to learn if he has been indicted.","Jaime Castano said to have shared mobile phone clip on Snapchat .

"North Korea's national airline is the world's only carrier to be awarded just one star - for the fourth time in a row. Air Koryo came last in a list of the world's 600 carriers, ranked on in-flight meals, the skill of staff, aircraft age and efficiency. The dismal performance comes despite North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attempting to revitalise the country's national airline and even rumours claiming the dictator wants cabin crew to wear skimpier uniforms. Scroll down for video . The terrible rating of North Korean's national airline Air Koryo will likely mean Kim Jong-un pushes ahead with aviation improvements . Air Koryo has been ranked as the worst airline in the world for 2014 in Skytrax's recent research, for the fourth consecutive year . The research carried out by Skytrax, a UK-based consultancy providing airline and airport reviews and rankings, gave the airline low ranking for its aging aircraft and outdated practices. With no new aircraft purchased for over 20 years, a fleet of 64 obsolete planes that date back to the 1960s, it seems the urgings of the Supreme Leader have fallen on deaf ears. The fleet flies to 14 airports in six countries; the most popular destinations are Beijing and Shenyang in China. As expected, in-flight entertainment is restricted to magazines and films detailing the great works of North Korea's leader Jong Un. Due to the age of the aircraft, the cockpit is behind the times with no digital assistance . Luggage is still weighed by hand on old fashioned scales in the deserted airport customs lounge. The cabins look like something out of a museum, and the in-flight meals are constantly criticised by flyers. The findings were based on the skill-set of staff, standard of in-flight meals and entertainment, and quality of aircraft . The aircraft for Air Koryo can be dated back to the 1960s and are in urgent need of modernisiation if the fleet is to rise from one-star level . tHE fleet flies to 14 airports in six countries; the most popular destinations are Beijing and Shenyang in China . Perhaps what will irk Kim Jong Un even more is that six of the seven five-star airlines are all based out of the Far East. Japan's ANA All Nippon Airways, South Korea's Asiana Airlines, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways, Indonesia's Garuda Indonesia, China's Hainan Airlines and Singapore Airlines are all top of the tree, along with Qatar Airways. Photographer Aram Pan from Singapore gained unprecedented access to the Soviet-era planes still used in North Korea by the nation’s civil carrier, Air Koryo, plus cargo transporters and helicopters, after joining a tour for aviation enthusiasts inside the communist enclave. From the photos, the airline, which was founded in 1950 as a joint North Korean-Soviet partnership to connect the capital Pyongyang with Moscow, appears to be stuck in a time warp. Photographer Aram Pan was greeted by smiling Air Koryo flight attendants dressed in smart navy blue outfits before he boarded an Ilyushin Il-18 plane, a large turboprop airliner. The Soviet aircraft was first flown in 1957 . Inside the cockpit of the Ilyushin Il-18 things looks very different to modern planes, there is not a digital screen in sight . The cockpit in the Ilyushin Il-18 plane, a large turboprop airliner that first flew in 1957, is a long way from digital. Astonishingly, the flight’s communication officer appears to sit in the passenger seating area and listens in to air traffic control on an ancient pair of headphones. While the Ilyushin Il-18 is known for its durability, with many planes achieving over 45,000 flight hours, there is a bold contrast in its appearance to modern aircrafts. In March 2006, due to safety and maintenance concerns, Air Koryo was banned from flying into the European Union. In March 2010, the airline was allowed to resume operations  but only with their TU-204s aircraft. ‘At first I was a little nervous about flying,’ Mr Pan, who was on his third trip to North Korea, told Daily Mail Australia. However, he said after his first flight in a historic plane ‘it wasn’t scary at all’. Six of the top five-star airlines are in the Far East, which will more than likely anger Kim Jong-un even more . Baggage check-in is a lot more old fashioned at Samjiyon Airport, a military airport near Samjiyon County, Ryanggang Province, North Korea . An Air Koryo flight to Pyongyang Sunan International Airport, the main airport serving North Korea, shows its ready for boarding. Mr Pan flew from Kuala Lumpur into Pyongyang with Air Koryo on the August 25 . The new modernised Pyongyang International Airport is nearing completion and looks set to open in this year . 'I was constantly looking forward to the next joyride. Besides… there were 48 other members of the tour group and everyone was like a kid in the candy store. I couldn’t possibly be nervous with everyone so psyched up about every ride,’ he added. Mr Pan flew out to North Korea with UK based company Juche Travel, who have been running DPRK aviation tours for the past three years. ‘The DPRK is now the only country in the world where you can reliably fly on all major Soviet era aircraft in one place,’ their website informs. From the 11-20 September, the flyers experienced eight different aircraft types on both scheduled international and internal charter flights. Inside the Ilyushin Il-18 there are blue chairs and blue carpet. Curtains draw across the windows and overhead luggage is stored less securely than in modern planes . Not enough leg room? Seats on the Ilyushin Il-18 all fold down. But entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their DPRK dramas and documentaries, Mr Pan revealed . The in-flight meal featured rice and chicken and fruit cocktail for desert. 'The food is better than I expected,' Mr Pan commented . In Mr Pan’s revealing photos, he shows the empty airport customs area at Pyongyang, the main airport serving North Korea, as well as a glimpse at the revamped International Airport which looks set to open in 2015. A new airport isn’t the only update North Korea is making to its airline. In 2013, Air Koryo appeared to be making efforts to update its image to the outside world, changing the uniforms worn by flight attendants from red and white to navy blue with a white studded trim. Flight attendants smile in the smart outfits in Mr Pan’s photos, their black hair swept back into chic buns. 'The air stewardess are polite and soft spoken. From what I understand, they never leave the plane to change shifts at Kuala Lumpur,’ Mr Pan said after his international flight. Inside the plane, entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their DPRK dramas and documentaries but the seats do fold down for extra leg room. In the services area of the Ilyushin Il-18, a steward prepared the meals metal containers. Unlabelled bottled water was stored in a tub . The female flight attendants served drinks from plastic cups. In 2013 some of the attendants' uniforms changed from red and white to navy blue with studded white trim . Life vests are stored under the seats of the Ilyushin Il-18 in case of emergencies. The toilet area features an old fifties interior . Mr Pan has previously visited North Korea twice, and in 2013 he witnessed bustling markets, men and women enjoying themselves at a Western looking water park and miles and miles of crops ready for harvest, shattering all of his illusions about what a holiday to North Korea would entail. This time he said his trip was 'a very different experience' because he wasn't on his own with just official guides to keep him company. ‘I ended up being the odd one out… it was like I attended a Star Trek convention and everybody was speaking Klingon. These guys absolutely love and know their planes,’ Mr Pan said of joining the aviation fans. ‘The tour group were all over the runway, happily snapping away at the planes. And the North Korean government didn’t even mind one bit,’ he said. In one of Mr Pan’s videos the tour group is seen running across the runway in a dash to get the best seats on the plane. And despite North Korea being known as highly-secretive, the photographer believes his latest tour shows things are becoming more open. ‘It's a huge leap forward in terms of relaxing the rules. Everyone was even allowed into the cockpits to take photos,’ he said. The communications officer on the flight sat outside the cockpit in the passenger area and listened in with an ancient looking pair of headphones . The old green seats in the Ilyushin Il-18 cockpit are covered with beige material. The empty weight of the plane is 35,000 kg . Mr Pan also took a flight on the Russian made Tupolev Tu-204. 'I'm told this particular plane is only four years old,' he said . The safety instructions on board the flights were in both Korean and English . Mr Pan said: 'The air stewardess are polite and soft spoken. From what I understand, they never leave the plane to change shifts at Kuala Lumpur' Toilets in the Tupolev Tu-204 were 'clean' and had 'no foul smell'. Mr Pan flew into Pyongyang again with Air China on September 13 . A red, white and blue Air Koryo shuttle boss transports passengers from the terminal to the planes .

"A police investigator says a Pennsylvania man initially laughed when told that authorities planned to search his property for bodies, then became nervous and repeatedly glanced at the area where police later found two corpses. State police Lt. Richard L. Krawetz testified Wednesday at the trial of Hugo Selenski, who's charged with strangling a pharmacist and the pharmacist's girlfriend in 2002. Krawetz, the trial's first witness, says Selenski denied that any bodies were buried in the yard and even offered to help dig. Nervous? A police officer testified Wednesday that Hugo Seleneski initially laughed when told that authorities planned to search his property for bodies, then became nervous and repeatedly glanced at the area where police later found two corpses . Selenski has pleaded not guilty to killing Michael Kerkowski and Tammy Fassett. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Authorities found at least five sets of human remains in Selenski's yard in 2003. Selenski was acquitted in 2006 of killing two other people but convicted of abusing their corpses. The career criminal brutally beat and strangled a pharmacist and the pharmacist's girlfriend as part of a plot to steal tens of thousands of dollars from the druggist, who had been operating a prescription drug ring and was flush with cash, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday. Hugo Selenski needed about $10,000 to cover a check his girlfriend had written to purchase a house. He got that and far more, Luzerne County Assistant District Attorney Jarrett Ferentino told jurors in an opening statement that portrayed Selenski as greedy, manipulative and extremely violent. The trial opened nearly a dozen years after investigators found at least five sets of human remains buried in Selenski's yard. He is charged with strangling two of the victims: Michael Kerkowski, a pharmacist who had called Selenski his best friend, and Kerkowski's girlfriend, Tammy Lynn Fassett, who prosecutors said was in the wrong place at the wrong time when Selenski and a co-conspirator showed up at Kerkowski's house in May 2002. Victims: Selenski is charged with strangling Michael Kerkowski, a pharmacist who had called Selenski his best friend, and Kerkowski's girlfriend, Tammy Lynn Fassett, who prosecutors said was in the wrong place at the wrong time when Selenski and a co-conspirator showed up at Kerkowski's house in May 2002 . Grim: At least five bodies were uncovered on Selenski's property. He's only been accused of killing two of the. He was acquitted of killing two others and a fifth was never identified . Selenski, 41, has pleaded not guilty to homicide, robbery and related counts. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Ferentino said Selenski and his co-conspirator, Paul Weakley, bound the victims and covered their eyes with duct tape. Kerkowski was beaten with a rolling pin, and he and Fassett were strangled with flex ties. Selenski operated in 'a world of manipulation, a world of violence. You will hear it's a world of greed. You will hear it's a world that leaves its victims bound and broken,' Ferentino said. 'What you hear will shock you. It will horrify you. And it will break your heart. But it happened.' Selenski and Weakley tortured Kerkowski into revealing the location of tens of thousands of dollars he'd hidden in the house, Ferentino said. After the killings, Selenski stole tens of thousands more that Kerkowski had given to his father for safekeeping — at one point pointing a gun at the father and threatening him, Ferentino said. Selenski blew through $100,000 of the pharmacist's money in three months, Ferentino said. Selenski, who is already serving a decades-long prison sentence in a home invasion and robbery, grimaced, shook his head and whispered to his attorneys throughout the prosecutor's presentation. His attorney, Bernard Brown, pinned all the blame on Weakley, who avoided a death sentence by pleading guilty to federal charges in connection with the killings and is scheduled to testify against Selenski. Bury: Selenski allegedly strangled the couple and hid the bodies behind a high school before enlisting the help of an accomplice to bury the bodies on his property in 2002. Sentence: Selenski is currently serving an up to 65-year sentence for robbery. In 2003, his alleged co-conspirator led police to his Pennsylvania home where five bodies were found on the property . Brown told jurors that Weakley's story to police shifted over time, and he contended the evidence points to Weakley as the sole culprit. Kerkowski had pleaded guilty to selling more than 330,000 doses of painkillers without prescriptions and was awaiting sentencing when he and Fassett disappeared. Weakley led police to Selenski's property north of Wilkes-Barre in June 2003. There, they found the corpses of Kerkowski and Fassett in a shallow grave, plastic ties around their necks. Weakley knew the location of the bodies, Brown said Wednesday, 'because he put them there.' Investigators searched the rest of the yard and found additional bodies. Authorities have long said they found at least five sets of human remains, and maybe more, but only four victims have ever been identified. Prosecutors took an initial crack at Selenski in 2006, when he stood trial in the slayings of the other two victims who were identified.

"The Duchess of Cornwall has revealed that she regularly cuddles up with her grandchildren to tell them bedtime stories - and also wants to encourage 17-month-old Prince George to read. Launching a creative writing contest with Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans yesterday, Camilla recalled how her own passion for reading and writing was inspired by her late father. He, said the Duchess, would perch on the end of her bed at night telling 'fabulous' tales that would leave her imagination reeling. Hands up! A little boy thinks of a story idea during today's visit from the Duchess of Cornwall . 'I have a step-grandson called George and while he is too little to enter now, I hope one day he will,' she added. 'If you can read and tell stories you can sit in an empty room and take yourself into all sorts of exciting worlds. 'It's something my father taught me and then I went on to read to my children and now grandchildren. 'Sadly I am at least 100 and far too old to enter, but I hope everyone who can will.' While Prince George might be too young to enter a writing competition, he certainly isn't averse to books and was spotted clutching what looked like a copy of Curious George as he was driven into Buckingham Palace for the Queen's annual Christmas lunch in December.

By the time the second book in the series, Curious George Takes A Job, was published in 1947, the monkey had his name back and Curious George has remained Curious George ever since.

Camilla suggested a story about a shell washing up on a deserted treasure island, which led to the children excitedly pitching in with their own ideas. 'What wonderful stories,' she said. She also asked the Horrid Henry author: 'When I was at school about 100 years ago, I was taught to write a beginning, middle and end. Where do you start?'

"At an hour long, the State of the Union is a good chance to catch up on some shut-eye. Or at least Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg thought - because it appears she nodded off during Obama's address on Tuesday night. Cameras caught the moment that the 81-year-old justice's head dropped just after 10pm as the president neared the end of his speech, which clocked in at 59 minutes and 57 seconds. Ginsburg, who has been caught snoozing at speeches in the past, was saved by colleagues Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy, who repeatedly tried to keep her awake. Scroll down for video . Having a snooze: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg apparently fell asleep during the State of the Union address on Tuesday night - leaving her colleague Anthony Kennedy, left, to give her a nudge . Struggle: Ginsburg, 81, apparently battled to keep her eyes open during the almost hour-long address . Kennedy elbowed her at one point, the Washington Post reported, while Breyer nudged her as many as eight times and repeatedly looked at her to make sure she was awake, it added. But their quick-thinking didn't stop viewers spotting her apparent snooze. 'We are all Ruth Bader Ginsburg now,' conservative blogger Michelle Malkin wrote on Twitter. 'zzzzzzzzzzzz.' Writer Marc Wilmore said: 'Last person to leave the chamber please place a blanket over Ruth Bader Ginsberg before turning the lights out.' 'Ruth Bader Ginsberg was not napping!' comedy writer Caissie St Onge added. 'She is very small and that statement necklace is heavy!' Before the speech, Ginsburg had looked excited to be there.

Fan: Obama greets Ginsburg, whom he once called 'one of my favorite people', on Tuesday night . When Obama approached the stage ahead of his speech, she embraced him in a tight hug. 'She is one of my favorite people,' the president told The New Yorker in 2014, after she was taken to hospital for a blocked artery. Ginsburg, the oldest sitting judge on the Supreme Court, was appointed as a Supreme Court Associate Justice by President Clinton in 1993. After her heart surgery, she dismissed suggestions she should step down. 'Anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they’re misguided,' she told Elle.com.

"A 61-year-old grandmother who brought up seven children on benefits says she wants an eighth with her 34-year-old fiancé - which would make her the oldest natural mother in the world. Sandra Gallagher said she fell in love with Richard Broom while dating his uncle and says 'none of my exes' have treated her like he has. The pair want to marry in June and have a child - but their plans have stalled after they were evicted for not keeping up with the reported £115-a-month contribution to their £500-a-month rent. Scroll down for video . In love: Sandra Gallagher, 61 (right) would like to have another child with her fiancé Richard Broom, 34 (left) Together: Miss Gallagher and Mr Broom will appear in a documentary about people on benefits tomorrow . They and Richard's mother Ida are now reportedly living in a homeless B&B costing taxpayers £588 a month, where they continue to receive £733 a month in other benefits, according to The Sun. But despite the course of love not running smoothly, the couple told how they are determined to begin their new family life once they find a permanent home. 'I didn't want any more kids before because of the people i was with, but now with Richard I don't mind,' Miss Gallagher told the Channel 5 documentary Benefits: Can't Work, Won't Work. 'I'd prefer to have one with him because I really care for him. 'I didn't think he would go with me because I'm older but he has been with another older person before me. Not quite as old as me, but I thought that's nice, I might have a chance.' If she succeeds Miss Gallagher, who has been out of work for 40 years due to health problems including kidney stones, would be two years older than the world's oldest mother not to use IVF. She already has seven children spanning two relationships, the oldest of which is 41 and the youngest is 29. Career ambition: Mr Broom during a session to take casting photos at an actors' studio in London . Mr Broom said: 'I wouldn't say I can't work, because I can. I guess it's just my laziness really'. According to the Channel 5 programme, he was evicted but later found full-time work on the railways . Mr Broom, a former road cleaner, was unable to find work for two years but has not given up his dreams - he said he wants to be an actor like those in Hollywood or EastEnders' Danny Dyer. Although his only screen offer so far was £5,000 for a part in a porn film, the programme showed him travelling to London to have casting photos being taken in a bid to be employed. 'It's my passion to become a Hollywood star,' he told the show. 'To become like Danny Dyer, to bring more money in, to help my mum out. We're just struggling but we try to make up the payments. 'Mostly I play on computer, Facebook, games and stuff like that, dossing around doing nothing. I normally check Facebook every ten minutes when I'm sitting there thinking of nothing. 'I wouldn't say I can't work, because I can. I guess it's just my laziness really.' The couple have been on holiday together to Blackpool and have been together for two years. Miss Gallagher told The Sun the couple's sex life had improved three years ago when she had a labiaplasty - commonly known as 'designer vagina' surgery - costing £2,500 on the NHS. Tough: The couple reflected on their time together immediately after they were evicted from their Kent home . Abuse: The couple had already moved in with Mr Broom's mother to make ends meet when they were filmed . She said she went in with a gynaecological complaint and was surprised to be given the surgery, but since then the results had been 'wonderful'. The pair will appear tomorrow night on the Channel 5 show Benefits: Can't Work, Won't Work, the third in a four-part series looking at the long-term unemployed. It follows in the footsteps of Channel 4's Benefits Street, which prompted a national debate pitching those shocked at benefits 'abuses' against those who said the 'stars' had been exploited. When the Channel 5 show was filmed the couple had already moved in with Mr Broom's mother to make ends meet, and were on emergency measures after having their benefits suspended. It showed them arranging their whole lives on a shoestring, including the wedding, for which Mr Broom bought a suit for £30 from eBay. The situation unraveled further when it was discovered the household was £5,000 behind on rent. By the end of the programme they had been evicted - though it said Daniel had since found full-time work on the railways. Even though the programme has not yet aired, the couple said they have already received abuse from people they know for appearing on it. Benefits: Can't Work, Won't Work airs tomorrow at 8pm on Channel 5.","Sandra Gallagher fell in love with Richard Broom while dating his uncle .

"Coronation Street actress Claire King says she had to have a facelift to get work again because TV bosses only give roles to 'women of a certain age'. The frank admission by the 52-year-old, who plays new character Erika Holroyd in the soap, will spark the debate about the struggles facing  older women on TV. She was a fixture on television for 20 years but once she hit her 40s, work started to dry up. Claire King, pictured, left, in 2014 as Coronation Street's Erika, said she had to get a mini facelift to boost her career. Work dried up for the TV actress, pictured right in 2012, when she hit her 40s . Claire appeared on Stitch Me, Lift Me on Sky Living in February, 2013, and talked about the 'one stitch' mini-facelift she had at Harley Street Skin Clinic on Daybreak with Lorraine Kelly . The actress, who played Emmerdale villain Kim Tate for ten years, told Closer magazine: 'Things slowed down for me. 'I'd always played quite sexy characters, but TV bosses generally don't find women of a certain age sexy, so the jobs weren't there.' She started seeing friends with 'new faces' and began to think about how a procedure might boost her career. In early 2013 she appeared on a Sky Living programme called Stitch Me, Lift Me, featuring the Harley Street Skin Clinic and was filmed having a mini-facelift, or a French lift. She admits that her career has since flourished. 'I've been working pretty much non-stop ever since.' Claire -  who's back in the soap fold playing cougar Erika, who's having an affair with Nick Tilsley in Corrie - has also gone on a health kick and given up her 60-a-day cigarette habit. Claire, pictured here in October 2013, says TV bosses don't find women of a 'certain age' sexy . Claire's Corrie character Erika is enjoying a romance with toyboy Nick Tilsley, played by Ben price, pictured . Of her facelift, she said: 'I'll admit I was nervous, but the doctor assured me it wouldn't make me look different - I'd just look like myself again. 'It was done under local anaesthetic and it wasn't painful - I was back in my hotel room an hour and a half later.' She also says it gave her confidence which has also helped. 'The procedure gave me a boost mentally, and people pick up on that positivity. Life's definitely begun again at 52.' The actress says she doesn't plan to have any more cosmetic surgery. Claire shot to fame as Emmerdale's vampy villain Kim Tate, here in 1999, and acted in the soap for ten years . Claire is best known as  Emmerdale's Kim (left), but also appeared in award-winning drama series Bad Girls . Claire isn't the first famous face to raise the issue of employment on screen over the age of 40. Former BBC presenter Miriam O'Reilly successfully sued the corporation for age discrimination after she was dropped from hosting Countryfile. She said middle aged women were not wanted by BBC bosses.","Claire King, 52, rose to fame as businesswoman Kim Tate on Emmerdale .

"President Barack Obama's favorite restaurant is Alan Wong's in Honolulu, Hawaii, based on the number of times he's eaten there since taking office, an analysis of his dining habits revealed. The president has dined at the high-brow eatery on every winter vacation since taking office, making it his most-visited food establishment,Time discovered. Boasting a four and a half star rating on YELP and four dollar signs, Alan Wong's, established in 1995, is no run-of-the-mill dinner spot. A single meal there once ran Obama and friends $75 a person before taking into account the cost of wine, which brought the price up to $105 each. President Barack Obama waves as he departs Alan Wong's Restaurant in Honolulu, Hawaii, after a visit there on December 29, 2010.  The president has dined at the high-brow eatery on every winter vacation since taking office, making it his most-visited food establishment . According to one YELP user who ate there earlier this month, the banana cream pie, left, comes 'with shavings of edible 24k gold.' Obama's favorite dessert, right, is 'The Coconut,' a haupia sorbet in a chocolate shell, tropical fruits and lilikoi sauce. When Obama eats at Alan Wong's , he almost always orders the twice cooked, soy braised and grilled 'Kalbi' style short-braised ribs, the restaurant's namesake says . According to one YELP user who ate there earlier this month, the banana cream pie there comes 'with shavings of edible 24k gold.' The banana cream pie was not listed on the restaurant's menu online, but it confirmed to DailyMail.com that the YELP review was accurate and the pie, a new item, is donned with gold leaf shavings. When Obama eats there, he almost always orders the twice cooked, soy braised and grilled 'Kalbi' style short-braised ribs, the restaurant's namesake told Honolulu Magazine. During one visit Wong said Barack and Michelle Obama also ordered as appetizers the seafood cake, a tomato with li hing mui dressing and his 'soup and sandwich,' which is listed on the menu as 'chilled tomato soup' with 'grilled Hawaii Island Goat Dairy mozzarella cheese, foie gras and Kalua pig sandwich. For dinner they had the Keahole lobster lasagna with crab cioppino sauce and saffron braised vegetables and ginger-crusted onaga long tail red snapper with miso sesame vinaigrette, hamakua mushrooms and corn, in addition to the ribs. Obama's favorite desert, Wong said, is the 'The Coconut,' a haupia sorbet in a chocolate shell, tropical fruits and lilikoi sauce. So often does Obama eat there, he has a favorite table and seat, which Wong once described as the 'feng shui' seat to reporters travelling with the president. 'Every time, it's a chicken skin moment,' Wong told the magazine of his experiences cooking for the president. Wong also catered a luau for congressional leaders at the White House for Obama's first year as a resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. At that event Wong served lawmakers Manila clams, pork butt, tilapia, goat cheese flown in from Hawaii Island Goat Dairy, sake and sweets from Waialua Estate Chocolate in Oahu, according to Hawaii Magazine.

"A 20-year-old blew his head off after apparently trying to play Russian roulette on his own. Bryan Javier Aguilera Soto had taken a Taurus .38 revolver and gone to visit a friend in Coquimbo, a city in the western Chilean province of Elqui, where he proposed playing the lethal game. His friend unsurprisingly turned down the offer before walking out of the house. Moments later he heard a shot ring out as Mr Aguilera shot himself in the head. Reckless: Bryan Javier Aguilera Soto, 20, who blew his own brains out playing Russian roulette on his own . He was rushed to the San Pablo de Coquimbo hospital but despite the best efforts of doctors was pronounced dead at 11.50pm on Saturday, hours after firing the fatal shot. Russian roulette is a potentially lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against his head, and pulls the trigger. With a six-shooter revolver, players have in theory a one-in-six chance of blowing their brains out; but in practice the force of gravity will probably make the full chamber come to rest at the bottom of the cylinder, altering the odds in favour of the player. The term 'Russian roulette' first appeared in a story of the same name by Georges Surdez, which describes Russian officers playing it in Romania in 1917, although it is claimed the game had been widely known in Russia since the early 19th century. Facebook pictures: Mr Aguilera had taken a Taurus .38 revolver and gone to visit a friend in Coquimbo, a city in the western Chilean province of Elqui, where he proposed playing the lethal game . Mr Aguilera's death came as the Coquimbo region's chief of police, Colonel Julio Gordon, warned of the danger of having guns in homes precisely because they could fall into the hands of the young and reckless. Days before Mr Aguilera's death he had launched a firearms amnesty in the city, asking any citizens with firearms to 'surrender your weapon' anonymously and with no legal repercussions. Since Mr Aguilera's death it has emerged that the revolver he used was stolen from a neighbour, who was registered to own it. A police spokesman said they are looking into the matter.","Bryan Javier Aguilera Soto's death came as police held gun amnesty .

"A carer was caught red-handed stealing cash from a dementia-suffering grandmother after her suspicious family installed a spy camera. Edward Helps, 61, and his wife Susan, 60, rigged up the hidden device and concealed it inside a DVD player to catch Leeanne Edwards, 38, in the act. They became suspicious after Susan's frail mother Irene Goody, 85, repeatedly asked for more money and cash kept disappearing last March. But after police reportedly told them they were 'too busy' to investigate, the family were forced to gather evidence themselves. Scroll down for video . Leeanne Edwards was caught on camera stealing from dementia sufferer Irene Goody, 85, after Mrs Goody's family became concerned that money was going missing and set up a CCTV camera in her flat . Mr Helps bought a secret recording device from the internet and set it up at the sheltered flat in Droitwich, Worcestershire. The camera then captured Edwards brazenly rifling through drawers for cash. Mr Helps handed the evidence over to police and Edwards was arrested in May last year and charged with theft. She pleaded guilty to stealing £120 at Worcester Magistrates Court yesterday and was told she could face jail when she is sentenced next month. After the case, Mr Helps told how the family were forced to investigate the matter and gather evidence themselves when West Mercia Police refused to help. The company director said: 'We were sure something was up because my mother-in-law kept asking for more money and was confused as to what she had spent it on. 'This kept happening over a period of weeks and it was starting to really upset her. Hundreds of pounds was going missing. 'When I contacted the police with our concerns they said they couldn't help because they were too busy and did not have enough staff. 'They told me without evidence they couldn't do anything - but surely it's their jobs to at least look for evidence.' The family said Mrs Goody trusted and liked Edwards and was shocked when she saw the footage . Mr Helps added: 'They [police] just said ""we've got more serious crimes to worry about"". I could not believe it. 'I decided we'd have to sort this out ourselves so I bought a hidden camera and set it up at the flat. 'After about a week of the camera being in there I was able to see Leeanne. If my mother-in-law wasn't in the room she went through the drawers. 'On one occasion she took my mother-in-law to the toilet and then went straight to her handbag, covering her hands so she didn't leave any fingerprints. 'But shockingly the police still didn't want to help. Eventually I said if you're not going to do anything then I'm going to go round and sort it out. Within an hour they had arrested her. 'My mother-in-law's trust in carers is totally shot now. She loved this girl. When she saw the footage she couldn't quite believe it. 'The amount of money is insignificant, it is the principal that counts and people need to know what she has done to our family.' Edwards, pictured with her T-shirt stuck in a draw, admitted theft in court yesterday and could now be jailed . The court heard Edwards had been privately employed by the family of Mrs Goody - who is in the early stages of dementia - to visit her every evening. She was entrusted with making sure the retired seamstress, who has eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, had taken her daily medication and had everything she needed before bed. Prosecutor Claire Linehan said the family first noticed something was wrong when money started going missing last March. She added: 'Going through the CCTV it was quite apparent she (Edwards) had entered the property and gone through a few items and looked through them. 'It was even seen she was wiping down the drawers to remove any fingerprints.' Kate Oliver, defending, added: 'She knows you will not be impressed at all that his is a vulnerable victim'. The thefts took place at The Heriotts sheltered housing in Worcestershire where Edwards had been privately employed by the family to come in and help Mrs Goody. The home's managers assisted the investigation . A West Mercia Police spokesman said Mr Helps could contact them if he wished to complain about the incident. He added: 'West Mercia Police is committed to providing a professional service at all times and when a complaint is received it is always investigated thoroughly and robustly. 'If it is felt conduct fell below our usual high standards it will be dealt with appropriately.' Clare Huyton, executive director for Fortis Living, who run the sheltered complex, said management had met with Mr Helps to discuss his concerns. She added: 'Mr Helps asked it was kept a secret from staff and other residents as he didn't want the carer to know about the surveillance.' Edwards, from Droitwich, will appear before the same court for sentencing on February 6.","Family became suspicious when money went missing from sheltered flat .

"On trial: Victorino Chua, 49, from Stockport, believes he has been made a complete scapegoat . A male nurse accused of murdering three patients by tampering with saline drips has been made a ‘scapegoat’ because someone had to ‘carry the can’ after a massive police hunt, a court heard yesterday. A jury has already heard how Victorino Chua, 49, also left another patient brain damaged by secretly injecting insulin into drips, turning them into ‘ticking timebombs’ to be used by unwitting colleagues. The prosecution alleges that Chua became the prime suspect after maliciously altering patients’ prescription charts six months later in January 2012 in a bid to trick colleagues at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport into giving them potentially fatal doses. Yesterday, however, Chua’s barrister claimed he had been ‘plucked’ out of a ‘huge number’ of people who could all have been the poisoner, and it had merely been his ‘misfortune’ to be working on the ward on the night the prescriptions were falsified. ‘The police put huge resources into investigating what happened at Stepping Hill Hospital with a vast number of officers,’ Peter Griffiths, QC, said. ‘Can they end up at the end of the day saying “I don’t know who did it?” Somebody at the end of the day has to carry the can. ‘The defence say, when you look at it, this man is a scapegoat. He is being blamed when it could have been anyone.’ Mr Griffiths told Manchester Crown Court there was no evidence linking Chua to the tampered records. He said Chua ‘had the misfortune to be one of a number of people on duty’ that night, and as a result, ‘whoops, the finger of suspicion goes back on him’. Victims: Tracey Arden, 44 and Arnold Lancaster, 71, died at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport in 2011. Chua is accused of their murders . Possible victim: Alfred Derek Weaver . After ‘a couple of years on bail’, he said, ‘they decide to charge him and he ends up here’. Should the jury conclude that the insulin contamination and the altered prescriptions were not the work of the same person, the prosecution case would be ‘like a ship that has been holed’, he added. Mr Griffiths said the defence would argue that whoever did contaminate medical products with insulin, did not necessarily want to harm patients. Instead the poisoner could have wanted to cause ‘hassle’ and create extra work for senior staff, he added. He said the defence would also argue that the insulin was not a significant factor in the deaths of the patients – but stressed that Chua denies being responsible. Filipino-born Chua, a married father of two, faces a total of 36 charges including the murders of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83. He denies all the charges. The case continues. Scene of crime: Chua had been working at Stepping Hill since 2009 when the deaths occurred. The court was told it was 'a lottery' which patients were harmed by the contaminated bags .

"The family of James McNair, the comedian killed in the New Jersey Turnpike crash that also seriously injured Tracy Morgan, have settled a wrongful death claim with Wal-Mart. The adult children of the 62-year-old comedian are said to be 'happy' with the undisclosed figure awarded for the accident on June 7 when a Wal-Mart 18-wheeler hit a limo carrying Morgan and his friend. 30 Rock star Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in the accident and his own lawsuit against Wal-mart is pending, while criminal charges against truck driver Kevin Roper are yet to be heard. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The family of comedian James McNair, (left and right) who was the mentor to 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan received a payout from Wal-Mart today . Pleased with the result of the case: Jamel and Danita McNair, the children of James McNair, are interviewed in New York on Wednesday about the outcome of their wrongful death suit against Wal-Mart . Attorney for the McNair family, Daryl Zaslow, told the Associated Press that terms of the settlement will be not be released. Walmart 'accepted their responsibility by making this family more than whole,' said Zaslow. 'They caused extensive damage to this family and more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family. Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs.' He added, 'No amount of money can replace what they've lost, but what they've got will take care of them and allow them to move forward, and their father would be happy for that.' Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company and the family worked closely to reach an agreement and that Wal-Mart was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident. 'We know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to Mr. McNair,' Buchanan said. 'We will continue to work to conclude all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident and we're committed to doing what's right.' Deadly: James McNair was killed when the limo van he was traveling in was struck by an 18-wheeler on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7 . Pending: The charges against driver Kevin Roper are still pending and he is facing four counts of assault by auto and one count of death by auto . The out-of-court settlement between the company and the estate of James McNair is the first stemming from the June 7 crash in which a Wal-Mart truck slammed into a limo van carrying Morgan and the others home from a show in Delaware . The attorney added that McNair's children, 19-year-old Danita and 26-year-old Jamel have so far not made any public comments to the media since their father's death, until an interview with the Associated Press Today. The settlement agreed between the McNair's and Wal-Mart allowed the Arkansas supermarket behemoth to admit no liability for the crash. Roper, the truck driver, has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto for the summer crash in New Jersey. The police allege that Roper had been driving his vehicle for more than 24 hours before the fatal crash. In addition, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving up to 65 mph in a 45 mph zone just seconds before the crash. Traumatic brain injury: Morgan, a former ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""30 Rock"" star, suffered a traumatic brain injury in the accident, according to his lawyer, and his lawsuit against Wal-Mart is proceeding in federal court .","James McNair, 62, died in car crash on June 7 after truck hit limo van .

"As temperatures plummet, hats are the fashion must-have. But is slinging on a bobble hat as effortless as Victoria Beckham makes it look? How do you know if Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s fedora will suit your face? And who can carry off pompoms? Mandie Gower, a 38-year-old mother of two, road-tested the hottest styles to find out. TRENDY BEANIE . Pompom beanie, £10, very.co.uk . I’ve seen so many people wearing bobble hats that I’m convinced they must suit everyone. Heck, even Victoria Beckham relaxed her cocktail-party-ready style to endorse the trend. Her grey felt bobble number whispered laid-back luxury, and there’s no doubt I could do with a bit of that on the school run. Yet my first thought is ‘tea cosy’. My second, ‘Well, now I know what I’d look like bald’. I think the bobble is best left to the oval or oblong faces. Mine is just too round. Am I too old for this look? Well, if you look like you might have knitted it yourself, it’s one to avoid. SUPER CHIC BERET . Leopard beret, £15, johnlewis.com . Within seconds of trying the beret, I realise that there’s no right way to wear it. Pinch it to one side for a classic French look, plonk it on the back of your head, or pull it over your ears when it’s really cold. It’s one of the few hats that suits cropped styles as well as longer tresses, as it will always reveal some hair, and it’s refreshingly low maintenance; at the cinema, I simply roll it up and stick it in my bag. It’s hard to imagine a time when the beret won’t seem chic. And at just £15, it’s a great investment. CUDDLY COSSACK . Cossack hat, £36, rubyanded.co.uk . The Russians know a thing or two about bone-chilling winters, so where better to take inspiration now that biting Arctic temperatures and snow have arrived on our shores? The Cossack sits securely on my head, covers my ears, and heats me up faster than an electric blanket. It also goes with everything — transforming my scruffy Puffa cover-up to something that could grace Klosters ski slopes. Even better, it’s one of those rare finds that looks equally appropriate whether your style icon is Cressida, Camilla or, erm, the Queen. FABULOUSLY FLOPPY . Burgundy floppy hat, £20, asos.com . A good option for long, oblong faces, which sadly precludes me. A pity, because I can imagine swooshing around the shops in this with a poncho — it feels playful and on-trend. The brim is cleverly cut to give coy glimpses of your eyes without compromising your vision. Fifteen years ago I’d have played up the Seventies vibe with a maxi dress, but now I’d stick to a leather jacket. Would I wear it in another 15 years? Probably not — I fear it would look too ‘girly’. BRIMMING WITH STYLE . Wide-brimmed hat, £28,  riverisland.com . The widebrim  hat is  guaranteed to turn heads, so you won’t be surprised to learn that Kim Kardashian is a fan. I love the drama of it, I love the suits everyone but under-used grey/blue colour. However, I can’t figure out when I would wear one. It would take only the slightest puff of wind to send it into orbit. That said, you’d make an impressive entrance at a party —  but one where you didn’t want to talk to anyone, as the brim constantly flops. CLASSIC CLOCHE . Navy cloche hat, £49, jacques-vert.co.uk . Say cloche hat, and I envisage ingenue types like Audrey Tautou — big, wide eyes peering up innocently from low-riding brims — both dramatic and demure. Yet the image in the mirror isn’t alluring; it’s me in my dotage. The heavy brim shrouds my face and the cloche’s dome shape pushes down on my eyes. I daren’t go into the Post Office in case they offer me my pension. Never mind asking ‘am I too old for this?’ Everyone is too young to wear this. Still tempted? Ask yourself ‘Am I a Downton Abbey dowager in a funeral scene?’ If the answer’s no, move on. CHEEKY TRILBY . Grey felt trilby, £39, jigsaw-online.com . This style of hat is the equivalent of a provocatively arched eyebrow, and Jigsaw’s trilby is a cheeky little number. At first glance the grey tweed and classic shape seem as British as a pinstripe suit, but when I pop it on, it’s quite the attention seeker. The stiff, curved brim makes it impossible to wear at anything but a jaunty angle, and peering out from under it at my builder feels downright flirty. In fact, I reckon it would help you sail past the snootiest of doormen. And unlike some of the other styles, it requires zero fiddling. FUNKY FEDORA . Pale pink fedora, £25, marksandspencer.com . This could be my secret weapon on bad wardrobe days. A fedora seems to work with everything and everyone, you just need a little attitude to pull it off. I love the way the wide brim elongates round and heartshaped faces like mine, not to mention how the blush pink colour flatters almost every skintone. The secret to wearing it is simple — you just plonk it straight on. As it frames my face so well, I’d be reluctant to wear it without make-up. And the shallow crown encourages good  posture — I immediately stand taller. Just don’t forget to pull your hair forward to avoid your ears poking out like elves from The Lord Of The Rings.","The temperature is set to dip this weekend and we'll all be digging out the winter woollies .

"Just wizard: J.K. Rowling will co-produce a new play based on her Harry Potter tales, which is set to open in the West End within the next two years . Truly it’s beyond wizard. I can exclusively reveal that a play based on J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter tales will open in the West End within two years. Rowling will not write the stage piece — however, she will co-produce and collaborate with a playwright. Rowling’s seven-volume Harry Potter series began with The Philosopher’s Stone, published in 1997. All told the books have sold well in excess of 450 million copies and been translated into 77 languages. Eight . movies were made featuring Daniel Radcliffe as the boy wizard with the . thunderbolt scar on his forehead, and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, as . Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, his best pals at Hogwarts School of . Witchcraft and Wizardry. But . the play, to be steered by prominent London and New York producers . Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, will mine (according to a statement . sent to me, as a mudblood, by Owl Post yesterday) ‘the previously untold . story of Harry Potter’s early years as an orphan and outcast’. Although the statement didn’t . spell it out, I understand that Warner Bros, the studio behind the . Potter pictures, will be involved in the development of the theatre . show, just as it was with the Sam Mendes musical version of Roald Dahl’s . Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which is running at the Theatre . Royal, Drury Lane. Harry Potter’s theatrical adaptation will seek to ‘offer a unique insight into the heart and mind of the now legendary young wizard. A seemingly ordinary boy, but one for whom destiny has plans...’ Rowling noted the numerous approaches she has received about putting Harry Potter on the stage, but the vision put forth by Sonia and Colin ‘was the only one that really made sense to me, and which had the sensitivity, intensity and intimacy I thought appropriate for bringing Harry’s story to the stage. After a year in gestation, it is very exciting to see this project moving onto the next phrase.’ Early years: A young Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. The new show will focus on the previously untold story of Harry Potter's early years as an orphan and outcast . A theatre has yet to be negotiated, but with a show of this quality — almost a licence to print money if all involved get it right — hopefully the right spell will deliver a theatre exactly when the show’s ready to go in 2015. Friedman is one of the producers behind The Book Of Mormon and the current hit Mojo, which co-stars Potter alumnus Rupert Grint, while Callender produced, with Richard Price, the TV version of the Royal Shakespeare Company’s landmark adaptation of Nicholas Nickleby and landed Tom Hanks on Broadway this past season with Lucky Guy. Such classy operators ought to be able to assemble an A-list creative team, and a writer and director will soon be contracted to begin developing the play. The model has to be David Heyman, the movie producer behind Gravity, who acquired the rights to the Potter series and ensured that only the very best of British (and one or two from beyond our shores) were entrusted to make the movies. Backing: It is understood that Warner Bros, the studio behind the Potter pictures, will be involved in the development of the theatre show, just as it was with the Sam Mendes musical version of Roald Dahl¿s Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which is running at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane .","Author Rowling will collaborate with a playwright for the West End show .

"A defiant President Obama used his sixth State of the Union address to offer a litany of Democratic priorities that centered on tax increases on the wealthy intended to fund new social programs benefiting everyone else. Unconcerned that he was addressing a Congress under full Republican control for the first time, the president danced around the outlines of his tax plan, dubbed a 'Robin Hood' approach by outraged Republicans that amounts to 'class warfare'. Obama said: 'As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. Scroll down for video . Republicans, including House Speaker John Boehner (right), won't warm to Obama's plan to raise $320billion in new taxes to redistribute to poorer Americans . Obama launched his tax-grab plan in an address to a Congress under full Republican control for the first time . 'They've riddled it with giveaways the super-rich don't need, denying a break to middle-class families who do. 'Let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one per cent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth,' the president demanded. 'We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college. 'Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?' he asked later in his address, 'or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?' Obama first wants to hike the capital gains rate on couples making more than $500,000 annually, from 20 to 28 per cent. The White House has tried to sell the plan to the American people - and the Republicans - by pointing out that GOP standard-bearer Ronald Reagan once accepted the same tax rate for capital gains. But Obama neglected to add that the deal Reagan struck with congressional Democrats during the 1980s also set the top marginal income tax rate at 28 per cent. The top rate today in the United States is 39.8 per cent – a rate Republicans have long sought to bring down by arguing that lower tax rates encourage investment and job creation. The president also wants to change the way taxes are calculated when an investor dies and bequeaths stocks to someone. Under current law, anyone who inherits stock is liable for taxes based on its original cost - not what it was worth when the original investor died. That, Obama's economic advisers insist, should change. The difference could be devastating for the children of America's smartest and most patient investors. Stock bought decades ago for $10,000 and worth $200,000 at the time of death, for instance, would create a capital gains tax liability that's 20 times bigger under Obama's proposal – and heirs have to pay that tax when they inherit the stock. The White House's plan also slaps a one-time fee on about 100 large U.S. investment banks and other giant financial firms with assets of $50billion or more. The suggested fee on big banks is meant to discourage financial institutions from engaging in the risky behaviors that led to the 2008 crash, the White House says. Obama hopes the new tax plans will raise $320 billion over 10 years – and wants to spend it right away. His social program agenda includes a new $500 tax credit for many two-income households, an expanded tax credit for families who pay for child care, and an ambitious plan to pay for community college tuition in its entirety. That plank of Obama's platform alone could cost $60 billion in its first decade, but some analysts claim the cost but even higher since community colleges could raise tuition fees as more government money enters the system. Republican lawmakers sat on their hands as the president proposed a massive tax hike on investors and other wealthy Americans . Republicans declared the tax plan dead on arrival before Tuesday night's speech, even though it won't have a formal unveiling until the president's budget hits their desk on February 2. 'This is not a serious proposal,' Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee chairman Paul Ryan, told the Washington Post. 'We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler, flatter tax code, not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending.' Wisconsin Republican Ryan slammed Obama on Fox News, accusing him of using 'class warfare rhetoric'. 'That's not presidential,' he said. Virginia Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock told DailyMail.com that Obama's tax proposals will go nowhere. 'I think it's pretty clear that that’s a non-starter, and I think the president knows that,' Comstock said. 'Those kind of tax increases would just be devastating to the economy. And you know we still have a very fragile economy.' In a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also levelled the 'class warfare' charge at the president. Hatch has set his sights on reforming the tax code in a different way. Obama's plan 'appears to be more about redistribution,' he said, which 'is unfortunate, because we’re going to need real leadership from the White House – not just liberal talking points – if tax reform is going to be successful.' House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan slammed Obama afterwards for 'class warfare rhetoric' Sen. Ted Cruz said Obama's 'more taxes' mantra was reminiscent of the Saturday Night Live 'More Cowbell' sketch featuring Christopher Walken . Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor who is weighing up a third run for the White House, slammed the president for 'ignoring the fact that the country has elected a Congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes'. Romney's main competitor for Republican front-runner status, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, vented on Facebook. 'It’s unfortunate President Obama wants to use the tax code to divide us – instead of proposing reforms to create economic opportunity for every American,' he said. 'We can do better.' Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading Democrat in line for Obama's job after 2016, tweeted that he had 'pointed way to an economy that works for all. Now we need to step up & deliver for the middle class.' But Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz had mockery in mind. He said on Fox News that Obama's reliance on the expansion of government social programs – and the tax hikes that go with them – was a modern political version of the classic Saturday Night Live sketch that featured actor Christopher Walken demanding 'more cowbell' as a solution to every problem faced by a rock band. 'For President Obama, ""More cowbell"" is ""More taxes, more government; more taxes, more government"",' Cruz said.","President aims to raise $320 billion over a decade for new social programs including universally free community college tuition .

"House Speaker John Boehner said today Congress would discuss giving the Obama administration new authority to fight Islamic State militants - just as soon as the president sends over a request in writing. 'I expect the president is going to send an authorization to the Congress. I expect that we will have hearings on that, and that we will in fact have a debate and a vote on it. Timing has yet to be determined,' the Ohio lawmaker said today during a press conference following a closed-door meeting with his Republican colleagues. President Barack Obama vowed in his State of the Union address Tuesday to relentlessly hunt down terrorists from 'Pakistan to the streets of Paris,' then called on Congress to authorize his administration to keep using military force against extremists. We're still waiting: House Speaker John Boehner said today the House would begin its debate on a resolution giving the president new authority to fight terrorists - just as soon as the president clarifies in writing exactly what powers he's asking for . President Barack Obama called on Congress last night to pass a new authorization of military force agreement so that his administration can legally go after ISIS but did not tell them what to put in it . Obama is pictured here shaking hands with outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, right, after his State of the Union address. The president, in consultation with his military advisers, usually tells Congress what he needs in an AUMF, not the other way around . Obama argued that U.S military leadership in Iraq and Syria is stopping the Islamic State's advance, but asked lawmakers 'to show the world that we are united in this mission' with a vote permitting the U.S. to go to war with the extremist group. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly said they are prepared to work with him to pass such a measure if he sends a proposal up to Capitol Hill. Typically, the president tells Congress what military authority he wants and needs, not the other way around, they have argued. And in their response to Obama's address, given by Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst last night, they urged him to come up with a 'comprehensive' plan to defeat the group. Obama said America learned 'some costly lessons' in the fight against terrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and they are guiding his approach to fight the Islamic State extremists. 'Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group,' Obama said in remarks prepared for delivery. 'We're also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed.' Obama said he believes in moving forward with 'a smarter kind of American leadership' that combines military power with strong diplomacy. 'That's how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve,' Obama said. 'When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world,' he said. 'That's what our enemies want us to do.' Obama said the United States stands in solidarity with people who have been targeted by terrorists, mentioning attacks in recent weeks on a school in Pakistan and across Paris. 'We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we've done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies,' he promised.","Obama asked lawmakers last night 'to show the world that we are united in this mission' with a vote to authorize war against the extremist group .

"Fighting back: A group of prominent Hispanic women want an apology from ABC following remarks made by 'sources' on The View about Rosie Perez . The View has come under attack from a group of prominent Hispanic women who say the recent treatment of reportedly ousted panel member Rosie Perez has been both racist and sexist. The actress is the center of much talk at the moment that she was fired as a present on The View after less than one season. She is currently on hiatus to perform in Broadway's Fish in the Dark, but insiders say she never adjusted to either the show's signature hard news/soft news chat format or reading a teleprompter. A source on the set of the ABC show also told The New York Daily News: 'She’s constantly correcting herself because she’s constantly screwing something up. She’s not the sharpest tool in the shed.' Those remarks drew the ire of a group who call themsevves #YoSoyRosie. The group have put out a letter defending Perez against the criticism that has been heaped upon her. The letter, which was obtained by TMZ, said that 'questioning a woman's intelligence is an old stereotype that is sexist and in this case also racist'. The letter also said that 'when you disparage the only Latina on The View, you disparage all Latinas'. Among the group members are New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and NY Secretary of State Lorraine Cortes-Vazquez and best selling author Esmeralda Santiago. Rosie is scheduled to appear on The View Thursday to address the comments. Perez was added to the show last minute and joined two other incoming hosts--Rosie O'Donnell and politico Nicolle Wallace. The shakeup came amid plummeting ratings and after show creator Barbara Walters' retirement. Demands: The letter, which was posted to Twitter, demands ABC apologize for the on-set leak . Tough times: Perez's reported departure comes at a tumultuous time for The View, which insiders have said  may not be back for a 19th season . While ratings stabilized, sources told Variety that Perez never properly settled in, and network insiders revealed to Daily Mail Online that the long-running talk show could end after this season, amid struggling ratings and infighting among the talk show hosts. The show is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with its new team of Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez. Now under the umbrella of ABC News, the network is considering the possibility of ending the show and replacing it with an extended version of 'Good Morning America.' 'The brass at ABC feels like they've tried to do everything possible to breathe new life into this show,' said the insider. They moved it from ABC Entertainment Daytime to the ABC News division, that was having so much success with Good Morning America. But in spite of the changes, nothing seems to be helping the sluggish ratings for the show. 'They're ready to abandon ship at this point,' the source told Daily Mail Online. When contacted by Daily Mail Online, a show spokesperson denied any plan by ABC to end the show. The show is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with its new team of Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez . The way they were: The show originated with Walters, Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos.It went on to have Sherri Shepherd, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Lisa Ling and Jenny McCarthy join the panel series. O'Donnell signed on to moderate the show in 2006, but departed the show after a heated on-air altercation with Hasselbeck in 2007 . ABC News is winning in the morning show wars with GMA and the network hoped that the magic of that team could rub off on The View. Despite multiple changes to the set, a new show introduction, a shift to softer topics and adding guest co-hosts to the show, ratings still have still declined. 'ABC feels it's exhausted their options with The View and now it's time to expand the existing franchise, GMA. They feel that since GMA is already beating NBC's Today during the first two hours of the broadcast, why not extend the morning broadcast,' the insider revealed. In 2012, following the cancellation of talk show The Revolution, ABC launched a test show called Good Afternoon America, the network's first extension of GMA. The temporary summer series hosted by Lara Spencer and former GMA anchor Josh Elliott performed well in the ratings for ABC and the network said then that it would consider bringing it back. 'The idea to bring back Good Afternoon America is something that's strongly being considered. They believe the success of GMA could carry over right into that 11am slot that The View currently holds,' another insider said. Spencer, who previously hosted the news magazine series The Insider, has been itching to do that show again because she likes the pop culture-oriented format. There's internal talk that ABC would use one of the newer GMA contributors Ryan Smith or T.J. Holmes as her co-anchor on the re-launched show. 'They plan on shooting some test shows in the coming weeks to freshen up the Good Afternoon America concept. They plan to shoot a few pilot episodes following GMA going off air and retooling the show just in case they need to have it ready for a late summer launch,' the source revealed. GMA squared: Lara Spencer and former GMA anchor Josh Elliott performed strong in the ratings for ABC when they tested Good Afternoon America and the network said then that it would consider bringing it back. There's internal talk that ABC would use one of the newer GMA contributors Ryan Smith (left)or T.J. Holmes as her co-anchor on the re-launched show. Canceling The View would be costly for ABC, as Goldberg has one more year remaining on her contract and her pay-or-play agreement would require she be compensated her $5 million a year salary whether the show aired or not. 'Whoopi is the winner either way. She's wanted out of this contract for years and begged to be let go during the show overhaul last summer. To get paid to just go home would make her very happy,' the source offered. The View launched in 1997 and became successful in the 11am time slot on ABC, a time period that no other morning show had been able to perform well in. The show originated with Walters, Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos. It went on to have Sherri Shepherd, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Lisa Ling and Jenny McCarthy join the panel series. O'Donnell signed on to moderate the show in 2006, but departed the show after a heated on-air altercation with Hasselbeck in 2007.","The 50-year-old actress was reported to have been fired from The View for 'failing' to settling in after one season .

In a video, titled 'Destination: Moon', the agency outlines its plans for making a home on the hostile terrain that covers the far side of the lunar surface. Scroll down for video . In a video, titled 'Destination: Moon', the agency outlines its plans for making a home on the hostile terrain that covers the far side of the lunar surface. Pictured is an area known as the South Pole-Aitken basin . 'In the future, the moon can become a place where the nations of the world can come together to understand our common origins, to build a common future, and to share a common journey beyond,' the video says. The moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means its near side always points towards our planet. Until now, researchers have debated why this near side has an abundance of features - such as the 'man on the moon'. The man on the moon is in fact, dark maria, or seas – large flat areas of basalt on the moon’s near side. No such features exist on far side of the moon . 'In the future, the moon can become a place where the nations of the world can come together to understand our common origins, to build a common future, and to share a common journey beyond,' the video says . While parts of the moon are shrouded in darkness, its huge mountainous peaks are bathed in near-constant sunlight. Esa wants to send robots to these peaks, and eventually humans (artist's impression pictured) The dark side, meanwhile, contains one of the largest impact crater in the solar system, dubbed the  which is believed to have formed four billion years ago. The general consensus on the moon's origin is that it probably formed shortly after Earth and was the result of a Mars-sized object hitting Earth with a glancing but devastating impact. This giant impact hypothesis suggests that the outer layers of Earth and the object were flung into space and eventually formed the moon. Earth and the impact object did not just melt; parts of them vapourised, creating a disk of rock, magma and vapor around Earth. The moon and Earth loomed large in each others skies when they formed. The geometry was similar to the rocky exoplanets recently discovered very close to their stars. The moon was 10 to 20 times closer to Earth than it is now, and the researchers found that it quickly assumed a tidally locked position - where the same side always faces our planet. The same real estate on the moon has probably always faced Earth. Tidal locking is a product of the gravity of both objects. Its diameter is roughly 1,550 miles (2,500 km), making it stretches across nearly a quarter of the moon. While parts of the crater are shrouded in perpetual darkness, its rim features huge mountainous peaks that are bathed in near-constant sunlight. Esa wants to send robots to these peaks, and eventually humans. It says the crater's rim is an ideal place to land humans because they have 'the potential for near continuous solar power and a spectacular view over the rugged and cratered landscape below.' 'Here we will put into practice the lesson from years on the International Space Station, to establish a facility akin to those that we see in Antarctica today,' it adds. In 2009, Nasa's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite analysed the chemical composition of the material below the moon's South Pole and discovered traces of frozen water. Esa is hoping to find out if water exists elsewhere on the moon, and if so, they want to understand where it came found. If the moon has huge stores of water, future colonies could use the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to create rocket fuel. '[This could] propel us further into the solar system and onto the next destination of our journey into the cosmos,' the video says. Future missions could also use the far side of the moon as a shield against radio signals coming from Earth in order to look farther into space.

"Cruise holidays are becoming more popular than ever and companies hve an ingenious way of squeezing in extra passengers. Instead of building new ships, at huge cost, cruise lines such as MSC are simply cutting their ships in half and adding extra sections, before 'sewing' them back up again. These incredible photographs show how the MSC Sinfonia is taken apart almost like Lego, and a new section is fitted in the middle at the Fincantieri shipyard in Palermo, Sicily. Scroll down for video . MSC Cruises has begun work to transform the second of its four Lirica-class ships with the arrival of MSC Sinfonia . To increase the size of the ship, it is literally cut in half and a new extension is added to the centre, as these photographs show . The works will continue into the night to ensure the ship is 'sewn' back together in a 10-week time frame . A look at each section might confuse the onlooker as to what is being constructed, but the finished article will be sure to impress. The work to lengthening and refit the vessel  will now include the addition of dedicated kids' club areas sponsored by - rather fittingly - Lego and Chicco. The huge project is only expected to take 10 weeks in total, extending the ship in time for trials before it starts carrying passengers again in November. The £150 million (€200 million) 'Renaissance project' is part of a huge scale upgrade to the fleet - adding 79ft midsections to four different ships. Fincantieri's world-class marine engineers have carefully bisected MSC Sinfonia's hull, after which the two halves of the ships were slowly drawn apart. The interior of the cruise ship is there for all to see after the incision sees the ship cut into two in Palermo, Italy . The work to lengthening and refit the vessel over the next 10 weeks will now include the addition of dedicated kids' club areas . MSC Cruises will refit and renew much of the ship's interior, bringing an enhanced sense of comfort and space . The ship's MSC Aurea Spa will also be enriched with additional massage areas, and a new outdoor spray park will be added on deck 13 . This week they will insert a 2,200GT, 79ft midsection containing 193 extra cabins. Then they will refit and renew much of the ship's interior, bringing an enhanced sense of comfort and space. Before MSC Sinfonia's arrival, Fincantieri's preparations were already well under way for the work on board and in the shipyard. On January 9, the new midsection was floated into the shipyard and hauled into the dry-dock area where MSC Sinfonia will remain for the duration of its stay. Once the work is complete and sea trials completed, the larger, smarter MSC Sinfonia will weigh anchor from the shipyard on March 25 for Genoa, from where it will begin for a maiden cruise to Ajaccio, Barcelona and Marseille. Once the work is complete and sea trials completed, the larger, smarter MSC Sinfonia will weigh anchor from the shipyard for Genoa . The project is expected to take 10 weeks in total, extending the ship in time for trials before it starts carrying passengers again in November . These photographs show how quite literally the ship is split in two to prepare for the new section that will mean more passengers paying on . MSC Cruises executive director UK and Ireland Giles Hawke said: 'Everyone at MSC Cruises loves our partnerships with LEGO and Chicco – they are two fantastic internationally-renowned brands. It is great news that we are giving families even more opportunity to enjoy these facilities by adding them to MSC Sinfonia.' MSC Cruises currently carries roughly 40,000 guests per day, but by 2022 will double its capacity to 80,000 guests a day – 3.4 million per year – once the Renaissance Programme is completed and the last of seven planned ships is delivered.","MSC Cruises has begun work to transform the second of its four Lirica-class ships with the arrival of MSC Sinfonia .

"Victim: Dr. Michael Davidson has died after he was shot twice on Tuesday morning . The cardiologist shot twice  by a gunman at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday morning has died. Dr. Michael Davidson was killed outside an examination room on the second floor of the Carl J. and Ruth Shapiro Cardiovascular Center. Stephen Pasceri, 55, appeared to deliberately target heart surgeon Davidson after asked for the doctor at the desk of the world renowned hospital's heart unit before opening fire. Davidson had treated the shooter's mother before she passed away in 2014. 'Dr. Davidson was a wonderful and inspiring cardiac surgeon who devoted his career to saving lives and improving the quality of life of every patient he cared for,' said a statement issued by the hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. 'It is truly devastating that his own life was taken in this horrible manner.' Pasceri, who is married and has children, then turned the gun on himself in an examination room and ended his life. He was licensed to carry a gun and police have said that his family had no idea he would ever have planned to commit murder. One of Pasceri's friends told WHDH that the family 'are in shock and say he was the nicest guy.' His mother, Marguerite Pasceri, died on November 15, 2014 and was reportedly treated at one point by the cardiologist who is also an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Scroll down for video . Response: Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief William Gross, (center left), walks through a revolving door as he departs the Shapiro building at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday after the shooting . Her obituary wrote that she 'died surrounded by the family she had loved so much in life. A light has gone from the world that can never be replaced.' In the same obituary, it added that she will be deeply missed by her children, Stephen, Angela, Matthew, Andrew and Rebecca. The Massachusetts Public Notices advisory states that Stephen Pasceri was also the executor of his mother’s will and estate. The suspect entered Brigham and Women's Hospital, affiliated with Harvard Medical School, sometime before 11 a.m. Tuesday and requested the doctor by name, Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said. Evans said police were on the scene at Brigham and Women's Hospital within seconds after getting the first calls about the shooting. Officers conducting a room-by-room search found Pasceri dead from a self-inflicted wound in an examination room. His gun was also found. Evacuation: Medical personnel walk past law enforcement officials, (right), as they depart the Shapiro building after the cardiologist was shot and critically wounded . Security: The hospital has a well-drilled evacuation procedure for an active shooter situation and put that plan into action on Tuesday . Global reputation: Brigham and Women's in Boston is world renowned for its emergency surgeries and facial reconstructions . Boston police had at one stage mistakenly tweeted that Pasceri had been apprehended and was in custody. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said that because the doctor was surrounded by colleagues medical help was administered immediately. 'We are looking at a possible motive. We know (the gunman) came into the hospital on the second floor looking for this particular doctor. There was a reason he targeted this doctor,' Evans said according to WMUR.Com. 'Our prayers go out to the doctor's wife,' Evans said. Police have said the situation was declared resolved at around 11.54am, but earlier there was a confusing situation. Crime scene: Boston Police officers, including Commissioner William Evans (C), work inside the building where a shooting occurred at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, Massachusetts . 'There has been a shooting in the Shapiro building, and the suspect has been apprehended. The Shapiro center has been locked down, and all staff are asked to remain in place,' the hospital said in a statement. One witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene. 'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB. Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building. In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event. 'I am extremely proud of the way our staff responded,' said hospital president Dr. Elizabeth Nabel according to the Boston Globe. Multiple agencies: The FBI, Boston Police Department and the ATF all arrived at the hospital after the incident on Tuesday morning . Checks: A man in medical scrubs ducks under crime scene tape as he leaves the building at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday morning . Police said the situation, which unfolded around 11 a.m. at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was 'under control' and they had recovered a gun .","Shooting happened inside world renowned hospital 11.07am on Tuesday .

"A fast food takeaway has been forced to reprint its menu after it accidentally offered its customers Aborigines as a pizza topping on its vegetarian option. The blunder happened due to a production error when somebody mistook Aborigine for aubergine and unfortunately, thousands of flyers were distributed with the embarrassing typo to houses across Southend-on-Sea, Essex. Super Pizza, who produced the leaflet admitted that the inclusion of the unusual antipodean ingredient was 'a mistake'. The popular takeaway was forced to reprint thousands of menus after the unfortunate typo was spotted . Super Pizza, pictured, in Southend-on-Sea mistakenly offered baked Aborigine as a topping following a typo . The flyer offered customers the chance to buy a 19-inch pizza which they claimed was the largest on offer in town for £10,99. A spokesman for the shop said: 'It was a mistake. We don't want to comment any further.' Following the embarrassing blunder, the shop has reprinted a new version of the menu with the correct spelling of aubergine - which, despite being a type of fruit, is commonly used as a vegetable. One diner Richard Coombes, 27, from Rochford, Essex, said: 'I couldn’t believe it when I saw it. 'I’ve heard of typos but this takes it to another level. 'I had to ask my girlfriend to check if I was seeing things.' The Aborigines, also known as Aboriginal Australians, were the original inhabitants of Australia before the British colonized the country in the late 18th Century. The new version of the menu has replaced Aborigines with aubergines making it acceptable to vegetarians . Mr Coombes added: 'We definitely steered clear of the vegetarian option after that. 'I love the Aussies but I wouldn’t want to eat them on a pizza.' Staff at Super Pizza, in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, have since explained the odd topping had been an innocent typo and should have read aubergine. A spokesman for Super Pizza Ltd explained individual branches are responsible for their own leaflets. JUST EAT, which provides access to the company for online orders, declined to comment.","Super Pizza in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, offered baked Aborigine topping .

"Arnold Prieto was executed in Texas on Wednesday night for his role in a 1993 triple murder . A Texas man has been executed by lethal injection for a triple murder committed in 1993. Arnold Prieto's execution started at 6.11pm on Wednesday and he was pronounced dead 20 minutes later after a lethal dose of pentobarbital began flowing into his veins. Asked by the warden if he had a final statement, Prieto replied: 'There are no endings, only beginnings. Love y'all. See you soon.' As the lethal injection started, Prieto said 'I can smell it.......Whoa' before he took several sharp breaths and then all movement stopped. Texas has stopped the tradition of offering a last meal and so Prieto had the prison meal of barbecue chopped beef, carrots & pinto beans with a choice of tea or water. Prieto was barely out of his teens when he and two friends, brothers Jesse and Guadalupe Hernandez, murdered Rodolfo Rodriguez, 72, his wife, Virginia, 62, and Paula Moran, 90, whom Rodolfo and Virginia cared for at their home. Up until his death Prieto had maintained his innocence in the deaths of Virginia and Moran, although he had admitted to killing Rodolfo by stabbing the man to death with a screwdriver. The Houston Chronicle reports that in a statement to police after the murders, Prieto admitted that the boys had been doing cocaine on the night before the murders, and that it was Guadalupe's idea to drive to the Rodriguez home and kill the three in order to steal $10,000 he believed they had for a check cashing business they ran from their home. When they arrived at the home in the middle of the night, Virginia made the boys a breakfast of tortillas and eggs, and after they finished eating Prieto claims Guadalupe stabbed the woman to death with a screwdriver. After that, Prieto stabbed Rodolfo to death and and Jesse killed Moran. They left with some jewelry and $300 in cash, and were eventually apprehended when a ring belonging to Prieto was found at the scene of the crime. Jesse was just 16-years-old at the time and is serving a life sentence, having been too young to be eligible for the death penalty. He had told police that Prieto was responsible for all of the killings. Guadalupe, who even police identified as the mastermind behind the murders, eventually had all charges against him dropped and served no time behind bars. Prieto was offered a plea deal of life in prison if he testified against the other two men, but he refused to do so. 'As you can see, the cards are stacked up against me,' wrote Prieto recently on the popular death penalty blog Minutes Before Six. 'Nothing new really, since they have been stacked from the very beginning. … Where is the dangerous killer and monster (jurors) foresaw??? … Maybe the crystal ball was cloudy during those days or maybe they did not shake the ball hard enough.' No late appeals were filed in the courts to try to halt his punishment. Prieto spurned a plea deal for a sentence of less than life in prison if he would testify against one of his companions. 'There was a way out,' one of Prieto's trial lawyers, Michael Bernard, recalled last week. 'We just couldn't get there.' This will be the first death by lethal injection in Texas this year, with two more scheduled for next week.","Arnold Prieto was to death in Texas on Wednesday by lethal injection .

"Con: Daniel Burgoyne (pictured) compared himself to a character from The Wolf of Wall Street . Posing with a fat cigar and a flute of champagne, he compared himself to the Wolf of Wall Street. Daniel Burgoyne, 24, who boasted of being a ‘real diamond geezer’, persuaded dozens of people to entrust their savings to him for investments in carbon credits, gem stones and wine. But in fact, he was merely a former butcher with an NVQ in business studies who lived with his mother. And despite claiming to run his business from a prestigious address in the City, he was based on a business park in the Kent seaside town of Folkestone. Yesterday, the conman was branded the ‘Fox of Folkestone’ as he was jailed for two years for cheating investors out of £75,000. Like his idol, whose life was made into a Martin Scorsese film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Burgoyne lived a lavish lifestyle. Police discovered the Rolex-wearing criminal was not the financial high-roller he pretended to be among his friends and family. He posted pictures on Facebook of a BMW, piles of cash and of him holding a magnum of champagne. Yet far from having any financial acumen, he had tricked 18 people into giving him their money. Prosecutor Jim Harvey said he tricked people into thinking they were investing in wine or diamonds and offered unrealistic returns. One investor spent almost £33,000 on a diamond and was told it would increase in value by 1.9 per cent every month but would be kept in Switzerland for tax reasons. Canterbury Crown Court heard how Burgoyne operated through his two companies Elite Broker Company and Elite Commodity Markets. Burgoyne's lawyer said he was 'dazzled by all the glamour he saw around him' in the financial world . Boast: Photos online showed a black BMW. It is thought he blew more than £56,000 before being caught . Flash: The 24-year-old conman posted a photo on Facebook showing off about a Rolex watch . Detectives found evidence that he blew more than £56,000 on the ‘high life’ until he was caught, including £2,130 on wine, £1,500 on gambling and £1,115 dining out. Police seized £27,427 from his account before it could be spent. His barrister Anthony Abell said Burgoyne gained two A-levels with poor grades and did not go to university but worked as a butcher in his teens. He said Burgoyne claimed he had been ‘headhunted’ by a company trading in carbon credits and when it went bust he started his own company. Mr Abell added: ‘He was a rather ambitious young man who was dazzled by all the glamour. But he is genuinely sorry for his lies which he made to close deals.’ Judge Simon James said that Burgoyne’s photographs laid bare how he spent ‘considerable amounts’ on a ‘lavish lifestyle’. He said: ‘This was a sophisticated deception in which just £10,000 of the £80,000 you received was actually invested – and even then not in anything which would produce proper returns for the investors.’ Comparison: Under this photo (right) a friend said Burgoyne's selfie could have been a still from The Wolf of Wall Street (left), the film about conman Jordan Belfort - to which Burgoyne replied: 'It was' Wad: Burgoyne's online life showed off about his riches while investing just £10,000 of the money he took . After he was jailed, friends poked fun at Burgoyne, who had previously posted pictures of DiCaprio online and referred to himself as imitating the Wolf of Wall Street. One wrote on Facebook: ‘A tragic tale of the Fox of Folkestone.’ Another added: ‘The Fraudster of Folkestone.' Burgoyne admitted 18 fraud charges and was banned from being a director of a limited company for seven years. Showoff: Burgoyne posted pictures of himself on Facebook holding huge bottles of Champagne . Unmasked: Despite his claims Burgoyne was a former trainee butcher who was lodging with his mother . Wealth: Burgoyne showed off about gambling in a Malta casino and eating oysters in a restaurant .

"A mother-of-two who fell desperately ill on Christmas Eve had to have her lower legs and fingers amputated after being hit by pneumonia. Tracy Ralph, of Hawkwell, Essex, is a keen runner who was training for a half marathon when she reported feeling short of breath of December 24. She was found to be suffering from pneumonia and her condition rapidly deteriorated over the following days. After being put into a medically-induced coma on Christmas Day, she has since battled multiple organ failure, meningitis, septicaemia, blood clots and bleeding on the brain. Scroll down for video . Tracey Ralph had to have her lower legs and fingers amputated after suffering multiple organ failure and developing septicaemia after coming down with pneumonia shortly before Christmas . Tragically, the 34-year-old, who has two sons aged four and 19-months, had to have her fingers and legs amputated below the knee. She came out of her coma on New Year's Eve, but is still in intensive care in St Thomas's hospital, London. Tracy's sister-in-law, Amanda Ralph, said: 'Tracy doesn't have any underlying medical conditions so this came completely out of the blue. 'She was suffering from flu-like symptoms just before Christmas but we thought nothing of it as it is so common at that time of year. 'The first we knew anything was seriously wrong was when she couldn't breathe and she had to be rushed to Southend Hospital in an ambulance on Christmas Eve. She's now at St Thomas's, since they transferred her there in the early hours of Boxing Day. 'We have been living through it, it has almost been an out of body experience, there has been no good news at all. 'We were close to losing her before she got transferred to London, the doctors said she might not make it at one point.' The mother-of-two's family, including husband Brad and sons Miller and Hudson, didn't realise just how ill she was before she was suddenly rushed to hospital on Christmas Eve . Tracy's husband Brad, 37, has been at her side throughout the ordeal, but he has kept their children, four-year-old Miller and 19-month-old Hudson, away until their mum is up to seeing them. She came out of her coma on New Year's Eve and doctors at St Thomas Hospital are hopeful Tracy will be well enough to be transferred to Southend hospital next week, but she is still battling a potentially fatal blood clot. Pneumonia is a swelling of the lung tissue, usually caused by an infection. Early symptoms include a phlegmy cough, fever or difficulty breathing. Mild cases can be treated with antibiotics but more serious cases, which can be exacerbated by underlying health problems, can lead to more serious complications. If left untreated, oxygen levels in the heart and brain can fall, leading to confusion, coma and organ failure, which can  be fatal. Pneumonia can also lead to septicaemia, which can in turn mean amputations are needed. Her devastated family have now set up a fundraising page to pay for her rehabilitation and the prosthetic legs and feet they fear she will eventually need. They have so far raised nearly £25,000. Her sister-in-law added: 'It's really humbling, we were up to nearly £18,000 in less than 24 hours. 'It just proves that Tracy is such a beautiful, lovely and caring person that so many people want to help her out. 'We have had people who didn't even know Tracy contributing and those saying they can't afford much but giving what they can. 'We know that when she comes out of hospital she is going to need a lot of help. 'Every penny will help Tracy and we are so grateful to everyone who has donated, we are raising the money for her rehab and ultimately the best prosthetic feet we can buy.' Tracy, who works for Clarins at Debenhams in Southend, had been training to run the Southend Half Marathon later this year and had been training with the Essex Ladies Running Club before becoming ill. A fellow member has now taken her spot and will donate everything she raises to Tracy's cause. To donate to visit youcaring.com .

"They usually create delicious dishes in their kitchen, but on today's This Morning they mixed up ingredients for something quite different - a vagina facial. The ITV show welcomed Lisa Palmer, 41, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, who shared her recipe for a achieving a more youthful vagina that costs less than £5. Three brave women agreed to try the treatment live on the show and feedback their views. Scroll down for video . Three women including Abigail, far left, agreed to try the vagina facial developed by Lisa Palmer (stood  next to intrigued This Morning presenters Christine Bleakley and Phillip Schofield) The three women test out the lotion developed by 'trial and error' by Lisa, far left, live on TV . Abigail, 74, said she wanted the treatment to impress her 30-year-old boyfriend . Juel said the 'vagacial' was a new experience but she didn't want to neglect the area anymore . Lisa said of the vagacial: 'The haggard looking vaginas of Britain need some natural remedial help to achieve a youthful vagina by using my DIY vagi-facial recipe once a week. 'Women are pressurised to have a youthful face at all ages yet we forget about the appearance of our vaginas.' The professional matchmaker became more conscious of how the years had aged the appearance of her own vulva following the end of her long-term marriage. As she began dating younger men, she wanted to improve the appearance of her private parts to boost her confidence and improve her sex life. Lisa shows Phillip and Christine how to mix up her lotion that costs less than £5 . She explains: 'We tend to forget our nether region, thinking a Brazilian wax is enough. When I was dating my first 'cub' or younger man I looked downstairs to realise it was bit wrinkly and dry compared to when I was younger. 'Paying more attention to the appearance and feel of our vaginas can do wonders for self-esteem and sexual pleasure.' Drawing on techniques from the Far East, Lisa said she found the perfect way to improve the appearance and feel of her vagina without plastic surgery. First, it involves steaming the vagina for 20 minutes. To do this, she recommends 'using a facial steamer - although it can be awkward to squat over - or one that you can hold over that area'. The women gave mainly positive reviews afterwards to the bemusement of many viewers . The three women, from left Abigail, Juel and Nadine, reveal what they thought of the beauty treatment . The women giggle as Juel reveals the treatment made her feel 'like she'd just had sex' Next her natural mix of ingredients must be applied - coconut oil (one teaspoon), Vitamin E cream (one teaspoon), honey (one teaspoon) and egg white (from one egg). She mixed up the potion - which she said has been developed by 'trial and error' using herself as the 'guinea pig' - on today's This Morning while being interviewed by an intrigued Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley. She said of the process to develop the perfect recipe: 'It is a sensitive area so you have to be careful, if something doesn't feel right, stop it. 'I tried using onions as they are meant to be good for the skin but they stung and smelt.' Asked if the lotion had been approved by doctors, Lisa replied: 'Doctors haven't said anything, it's just me. I have tried it over period of time and it has worked for me, it genuinely makes a difference.' Abigail is ready to try Lisa's recipe which contains natural ingredients like honey . Lisa explains the benefits of the treatment to Christine as Abigail waits to try it . Christine asks Lisa to talk through her recipe which she developed herself . The 41-year-old said she's proof it works as she has been told her vagina 'looks like a 25-year-old's' She said that women who apply the lotion regularly will notice the difference in three to six months. Three women volunteered to try the vagina facial on today's show. One of them was Abigail, 74, who has a boyfriend 44 years her junior at 30-years-old. She said she was looking for something to perk up her nether region after her GP was unable to help. She said: 'I went to my doctor and asked for oestrogen cream but she said it could give me a stroke at my age.' Speaking after being steamed and while the lotion was on for the recommended 10-15 minute period, Abigail said: 'To be perfectly honest, I'm feeling slightly warm where I'm not usually - so it's certainly doing something.' Afterwards, she said that she would 'reserve judgement' on whether it has worked till the next time she does the 'horizontal tango' with her 'dance partner.' Juel, who also tried it, admitted: 'It's a new experience, it's an area we constantly ignore, we need to love our vaginas.' She added: 'I feel a bit like I've had sex, a bit damp, am I allowed to say that on TV?!' The third tester, Nadine, owns a waxing salon and said she thinks it would be a treatment she could offer her clients in the future. 'I think they would like it,' she said. The feature prompted a number of reactions from viewers from the bemused to the critical. Taking to the This Morning comments section, Ann Johns-Johnson wrote: 'This is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!!!!!' Kelly Marie Speed agreed, she wrote: 'I had to look @ this post twice! Really? This has to be a joke how crazy? What's wrong with a wax and a nice warm shower with ph balanced wash.....seriously I've heard it all?????' It's not the first time This Morning have broadcast risque features relating to usually private matters - they have previously broadcast footage of a woman having a smear test and a man having a rectal examination for prostate cancer. 'Paying more attention to the appearance and feel of our vaginas can do wonders for self-esteem and sexual pleasure,' says the 41-year-old dating coach . Lisa, pictured with past-life regression expert Nicolas Aujula, first started focusing on the appearance of her vagina following the end of her as she started dating younger men and felt self-conscious . Begin with a Vagi-Facial for seven days in a row, then repeat once a week. INGREDIENTS . Coconut oil - Can kill bacteria and moistures the skin (one teaspoon) Vitamin E - Conditions the skin prevents signs of anti ageing (one teaspoon) Honey - Antibacterial and contains antioxidants to slow down ageing and boosts skin (one teaspoon) Egg white - Tightens skin and improves texture (one egg white) METHOD . Start with steaming the vagina for 20 minutes. Mix all the ingredients and pre-heat in microwave for 20 seconds leave on for 15 minutes then rinse off with rose water. Incorporate tightening exercises, clamp down as if you're stopping your urine flow, hold for 10 seconds, then release. Do 2 sets of 10 to 20 a day. Lisa promised that as a result of doing the 'vajacial' once a week, women will notice the difference. She said she's proof it works: 'I'm 41 and younger men say I have the vagina of a 25-year-old!' Lisa, who works as a dating coach, says it's the ideal solution for combating vaginal dryness, tightness and elasticity that become more apparent with ageing. It can also help mothers who may be a little stretched following childbirth. As well as steaming and applying the lotion, she also recommends women do pelvic floor exercises once a day (squeezing the muscles as if trying to stop the flow of urine). Lisa said: 'As we age and especially during the onset of the menopause, oestrogen production slows and then eventually stops, where the vagina can become dry and thinner. Childbirth and age can often leave us feeling loose that it's important to regularly exercise the pelvic floor muscles.' According to Lisa, the vajacial will cleanse, tone, and nourish your cervix, uterus, and vaginal tissues and help prevent bladder and yeast infections. She also said it has increased her self-confidence and self-esteem, enhanced the feelings of sexual gratification and even caused her to drop a dress size as she can wear tighter clothes now she's more toned. She said: 'When I tried my first vagi-facial it did feel weird as I'm not used to paying such close attention to that area but you get used to it and now I actually enjoy the experience of pampering my nether regions. 'I can't believe I neglected that area for so many years whilst married. 'Now my vagina hasn't felt and looked so good in years. 'The real proof in the pudding is the reaction I've had from guys that I have the vagina of a 25 year old. I've also gone down a dress size which has helped to further tone the skin around my vagina.' She revealed that she plans to work on a version for men next.","Lisa Palmer, 41, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, appeared on This Morning .

"If only dogs could talk - Connor would have endless tales about his wild adventure fending for himself in the harsh Australian outback over the past seven months. Although Haydn Roeger, his partner Sally and sons Henry,7, and Samuel ,5, never gave up hope of finding their beloved pooch - discovering that Connor was alive and would finally be a part of their family again is still sinking in for the elated family. The cute canine went missing near the family's hobby farm in Moodiarrup, about 250km south of Perth in June last year. Scroll down for video . Samuel (left) and Henry (right) when they were first reunited with Connor after seven months apart . Connor survived the harsh Western Australian outback for an incredible 210 days . Haydn Roeger was over the moon to have his beloved pet back home again . Haydn momentarily stopped the ute on the way back to the family home in Perth and was unaware that Connor somehow manged to come free of his harness that he was regularly tied up to on the back of the vehicle. 'He must have got spooked - it's weird I don't know why he did what he did,' Sally told Daily Mail Australia. 'Haydn even went back and camped overnight at the spot we lost him.' On their trips down to the farm over the past seven months, the two boys were told to look out for their precious pet because you 'just never know'. 'We never entertained the idea that he would have died,' Sally said. 'He is so strong and has such a beautiful temperament and he loves his family more than anything in the world.' Connor had lost nine kilos and his paws and ears were covered in grass seed wounds . Home sweet home: Connor's first night back in his comfy beanbag . A phone call at about 10.30pm last Saturday proved the loyalty and determination of Connor when farmers Hayden and Robyn Lubke found him on their 5,000 acre property, near Darkan, about 40km north from where he went missing. 'At first they thought it was a feral pig but luckily they went down to have a look and he took off into the bush but their Kelpie circled him like a sheep.' Hadyn and Sally told their sons that they had to pick up some sheep that had escaped from their farm but got the most the most unexpected surprise when they got to their destinaton. 'When Sam walked towards the back of the ute he stopped still and said ""Mum that looks like Connor: and I said ""Sam, it is Connor"" and then I burst into tears - the boys were delighted', Sally said. 'Connor jumped straight off the ute and ran over to us and we brought along his doggy wife Molly for cuddles and kisses as well. 'Sam said ""my best friend is home - I love him and missed him so much"".' Connor may have lost nine kilos and his paws and ears were covered in grass seed wounds but his tail has not stopped wagging since he got home. 'It's like he never left - it's weird - he's back on duty again patrolling around the pool while the kids are swimming,' Sally said. 'It's a just nice story of a family that loves their dog and a dog that loves their family.' It's like Connor has never left the Roeger family home in Perth, Western Australia .","Dog named Connor went missing near family's farm in Moodiarrup, about 250km south of Perth in June last year .

"Labour leader: The party is facing more embarrassment over Ed Miliband's plans for a mansion tax . Labour faces more embarrassment over its mansion tax plans after an independent report found council tax reform would be ‘fairer’ and raise four times as much. Ed Miliband claims his flagship policy will raise £1.2billion a year for the NHS on homes worth more than £2million. But the Centre for Economic and Business Research says it is ‘improbable’ that they would raise so much. Instead, it claimed that tweaking council tax bands, which have not changed for 25 years, would be a more ‘progressive’ way to raise revenue. Adding three extra brackets for high-end properties would generate an extra £4.7billion a year, it said. Critics say a mansion tax would target pensioners on low incomes whose property has soared in value in recent decades, while also disproportionately hitting people in London and the South East. The CEBR said that if politicians reformed council tax instead, existing discounts and exemptions would ‘mostly shield’ those on low incomes. It said: ‘Unlike the proposed mansion tax, a reformed system of council tax does not punitively over-tax a certain group of home owners – those whose homes are valued above £2 million – or a particular region of the country.’ The major new report will undermine the policy further and put pressure on the party to consider ‘sensible’ alternatives. Howard Cox, founder of the Fair Home Tax campaign, which commissioned the study, said the findings showed that Labour was ‘ignoring a fairer approach simply to score ill-informed public support’. Mr Cox said: ‘Our report reveals that Labour’s proposed mansion tax is a far less effective revenue raiser compared with a sensible reassessment of the council tax bands. ‘This fairer, more progressive approach to property taxation compared with the proposed Mansion Tax would provide a shot in the arm to local services and the NHS through existing channels, rather than adding more red tape. ‘This report demonstrates that a revised system – with those living in the most valuable houses paying more – would yield billions for local services and the NHS, while reducing the council tax burden for those living in the least expensive properties.’ Former Labour home secretary Charles Clarke has already branded mansion tax an ‘absurd proposition’, while Dame Tessa Jowell said she was ‘concerned’ about the effect on the asset-rich but cash-poor. Senior party figures: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls (left) was forced to deny criticism by Labour grandee Lord Mandelson (right) that people would be 'clobbered' by the tax on homes worth over £2million . Labour grandee and former business secretary Lord Mandelson has also backed council tax reform over mansion tax, saying: ‘It will take longer to introduce, that’s true, but it will be more effective and efficient in the long term than just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude, short-term mansion tax.’ Every property in England is in one of eight council tax bands – A to H – based on house valuations from 1991. But since then house prices have escalated. Currently, band A is for homes under £40,000, of which hardly any remain, while Band H is for homes over £320,000. The CEBR has proposed bands set from A to K, with the lowest band for homes under £85,000 and the highest band for homes over £4million. Those in band K would be charged £4,493 a year, almost £1,500 more than they pay now, while the average homeowner would pay £167 a year more. Affected by the plans: A road in Fulham, south-west London, which has more than a dozen properties valued at more than £2million according to Zoopla . It means the largest homes would be billed four-and-a-half times more than the cheapest, compared to just three times more now. If politicians wanted to raise a more modest £1.2billion, they could exempt everyone in band A and give discounts to those in bands B and C. Labour claims the £2million threshold will rise in line with prime property prices. They also insist that low-income homeowners would not have to pay up front and could instead wait until the property changed hands. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, and chair of the influential Public Accounts Committee, cautiously welcomed the report, but was reluctant to criticise the party’s key election proposal. She said: ‘All political parties have, in an absurd and cowardly way, failed to review council tax bands since 1991. Labour MP Margaret Hodge (pictured), chair of the Public Accounts Committee, cautiously welcomed the report . ‘It is ridiculous that somebody whose house is worth £30million is in the same council tax band as someone whose home is £320,000.’ Asked if Mr Miliband should consider council tax reform rather than controversial mansion tax, she added: ‘As we develop our proposals around property taxation we should look in detail at other proposals like this.’ Sir Malcolm Rifkind, Conservative MP for Kensington, said last night: ‘Mansion tax is absurd and ridiculous. It is morally and intellectually indefensible. ‘Even half the Labour party have identified it as a foolish and unworkable. ‘Unlike mansion tax, the proposed reforms to council tax would use an existing system which we already understand and which we know is workable. ‘I do not want to see an increase in taxation in any area because I believe in low taxes. But if it is necessary to do something, then adjusting council tax bands is infinitely more sensible means of doing it than mansion tax.’ He added: ‘It certainly deserves to be looked at whoever wins the election.’ Since council tax was introduced in 1993, ‘property values around England have shifted drastically’, the CEBR said. A revaluation in England was planned for 2007 but was postponed in 2005 by the Labour government and not looked at again by the Coalition. Politicians have been reluctant to change council tax bands because it could mean higher bills for homeowners, but the CEBR said it should be revisited. They claim their proposals would ‘shift part of the tax burden to occupants of very high value properties’ in a fair way. They estimated that the revaluation of properties across the UK would cost £257million to implement. Labour claims the £2million threshold will rise in line with prime property prices. They also insist low income homeowners would not have to pay mansion tax up front and could instead wait until the property changed hands.","Ed Miliband claims policy will raise £1.2bn for the NHS on home worth £2m .

"The lone survivor of a 1985 Reno airplane crash that killed 70 people who were returning from a Super Bowl junket says he can't bring himself to attend a memorial on the 30th anniversary of the disaster. George Lamson Jr. was 17 when Galaxy Airlines Flight 203 crashed in a field in south Reno on January 21, 1985. Rescuers responding to the fiery wreckage found him strapped in his seat in the middle of a street. Scroll down for video . Then and now: Gregory Lamson Jr. (pictured recently at left and as a senior in high school at right) was the sole survivor of the Galaxy Airlines Flight 203 crash that killed 70--including Lamson's father--in 1985 . Miraculous: Lamson was was discovered still strapped into his seat after the plane broke in half just in front of him and an explosion sent him flying behind a ball of fire into the middle of a street . 'I don't want to be remembered as the boy who survived this accident. I want to be remembered as the man that lived,' Lamson, 47, told the Reno Gazette-Journal this week. 'Life is a gift for which I am always grateful for. Thank you to all that have helped me along in my journey.' Washoe County officials plan to unveil a new memorial plaque on Wednesday after the original was stolen two years ago near the campus of the University of Nevada, Reno. Though Minnesota native Lamson moved to Reno way back in 1990--to the place he spent the last unscarred day of his youth and last saw the father he so greatly admired--he says he can't bear to attend the memorial re-dedication. But he said he recently visited the new memorial and was pleased with the plaque, which is embedded in a granite boulder and surrounded by pine trees that were planted in memory of the plane's passengers and crew. Lamson, his father, George Sr., and 64 other football fans from Minnesota had traveled on a charter flight from Minneapolis to Reno. Too emotional: A previous memorial plaque was stolen near the campus of the University of Nevada. The new was to be rededicated this week--without the only survivor in attendance . Moved near to his nightmare: Lamson would not attend the rededication despite living in the very city where it sits. The Minnesota native moved to the city where his life turned upside down--Reno, Nevada--in 1990, a decision he attributes in a documentary to the city making him feel closer to his dad . Some of the group went by bus to Stanford, California, to attend the Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and the Miami Dolphins. Others traveled to Lake Tahoe and watched the game at Caesars Tahoe. The group reunited late Jan. 20, 1985 at then-Reno-Cannon International Airport. Galaxy Airlines Flight 203, a Lockheed Electra 4-engine turboprop, took off just after 1 a.m. A minute after takeoff, the co-pilot notified the tower of a severe vibration and requested an immediate return. The plane crashed and broke in half just in front of the row where Lamson and his father were seated. A huge fireball followed, catapulting Lamson onto a street. His life would never be the same. 'I came from St. Paul, Minnesota,' he said. 'I grew up in a neighborhood where I was the paperboy. I was the kid that cut your grass, shoveled your sidewalk, the altar boy at Mass. I identified myself as the son of George Lamson Sr. I played hockey. I was a Boy Scout. I was an all-Minnesota kind of boy.' Lamson struggled to fit into society after the crash, for which he would receive a sizable settlement after the pilot was found to be at fault. Eventually, he would marry and have a daughter, Hannah . Lamson now works as a dealer at a Reno casino. The 47-year-old father appears in the CNN documentary Sole Survivor, which follows him and others who escaped death in major crashes that killed all their fellow passengers, which airs Thursday at 6pm . Like many in his unimaginable situation, Lamson would go on to suffer from survivor's guilt--much of it stemming from his feeling that others would judge him for the way he lived his life following his brush with death. He told the Gazette-Journal earlier this month that for years he longed to share the story of his life after the crash. He got that opportunity in the form of a documentary called Sole Survivor. The film follows Lamson and others in his position, including a young French girl and a pilot from Colorado. 'It was a wonderfully warm and enriching experience,' Lamson said of the first screening of the film. 'After the film was over, I got up to walk to the front of the theater and was given a long standing ovation.' Sole Survivor makes its national premier on Thursday's 30th anniversary of the Galaxy crash at 6pm on CNN. Seventy passengers and crew members perished when Galaxy Flight 203 went down and exploded shortly after takeoff from Reno-Cannon International Airport, since renamed Reno-Tahoe. It was a charter flight operated by Galaxy Airlines. 'We saw it crash,' said Floyd Arterburn, who still lives with his wife, Jeanne, near the accident site. 'My boy and I ran out to South Virginia Street. Somebody was screaming out in the field.' A fire department snorkel hovers over the still smoldering Galaxy Airlines Flight 203 wreckage south of Reno. The lone survivor of the crash that killed 70 people who were returning from a Super Bowl junket says he can't bring himself to attend a memorial on the 30th anniversary of the disaster . The plane crashed south of the airport runway in a field on the east side of South Virginia. The pilot was trying to return to Reno-Cannon for an emergency landing after reporting a severe vibration, possibly caused by an open service-access door under one wing. The National Transportation Safety Board report said the plane went down when the pilot, Allen Heasley, reacted to the vibration incorrectly by ordering an engine power reduction.

"The family of a Rochester real estate mogul and his wife whose private plane crashed near Jamaica in September says the plane’s wreckage has been recovered from the ocean depths. Larry and Jane Glazer, both 68-year-old experienced pilots, were flying from Rochester to Naples, Florida, on September 5 when air traffic controllers lost contact with their single-engine turboprop. The 'ghost plane' flew on its own for 1,700 miles before running out of fuel and slamming into the sea. In a statement released Wednesday, the Glazer family said they hired the Eclipse Group of Maryland to search for the plane and their parents’ remains. Finally retrieved: Larry and Jane Glazer were killed in September when their private plane went down off the coast of Jamaica. Their bodies were not recovered until this week . 'Due to the circumstances surrounding the crash, (including a water depth in excess of 3,000 meters), this goal proved extremely challenging,' wrote the family. They said the search was successful as of Wednesday and the remains would be brought home. 'It is with great relief that we will be bringing our parents home. We also recovered significant portions of the aircraft itself and we are hopeful that, in time, this will provide us with answers as to exactly what happened that day,' the said in the statement signed by the couple's children Mindy MacLaren, Rick Glazer and Ken Glazer. The husband and wife both had their pilot's license. Authorities believe they likely fell unconscious after a dangerous loss of cabin pressure mid-flight . On September 5, 2014, the aircraft carrying our parents crashed in the ocean north of Jamaica. Since that day, we have been resolute in our goal of bringing our mother and father home to Rochester. Due to the circumstances surrounding the crash, (including a water depth in excess of 3,000 meters), this goal proved extremely challenging. After the tireless efforts of many, we were able to commence a search earlier this month. We employed the services of the Eclipse Group, Inc. out of Maryland to plan and conduct a search for our parents and any remains of their plane. That search was a success, and so it is with great relief that we will be bringing our parents home. We also recovered significant portions of the aircraft itself and we are hopeful that, in time, this will provide us with answers as to exactly what happened that day. We are grateful for the expertise available to us, as well as the care brought to this situation by all parties. Our family would like express our heartfelt gratitude to Steve Saint Amour and his team at the Eclipse Group for making this possible. Without their expertise and tireless efforts, we would not have been able to bring our parents home. We also want to send a special thanks to the Government of Jamaica, particularly the Maritime Authority of Jamaica and the Civil Aviation Authority of Jamaica, for going above and beyond the call of duty in order to help our mission succeed. Knowing we did all that could be done to bring our parents home provides us with the possibility for closure and eventual healing. We appreciate all of the support we have received from the Rochester Community throughout this time. Thank you. Mindy MacLaren, Rick Glazer, and Ken Glazer . Experienced pilot: Glazer, 68, a father-of-three and a grandfather, is pictured in front of another small plane. Both he and his 68-year-old wife were licensed pilots . Ghost plane: The plane flew some 1,700 miles on its own before finally crashing into waters north of Jamaica . Their father, Larry Glazer, was seen slumped over the controls by a fighter jet sent to escort the plane. He and his entrepreneur wife Jane, both died in the crash. Their plane, which took off from New York on the morning of September 5, sparked panic when the pilot stopped responding to radio calls about an hour after take-off and passed its destination of Naples, Florida. It continued flying south for several hours at an altitude of 25,000 feet before entering Cuban airspace and heading towards the Caribbean, eventually crashing 14 miles North East of Port Antonio. A pilot who intercepted the Glazers said he believed Mr. Glazer was still alive, but unconscious. 'I can see his chest rising and falling,' he said in a recording of his dispatch. 'Right before I left...we could see that he was actually breathing.' The plane also had 'frosted windows', an indication of a sudden loss of cabin pressure and officials said they suspected hypoxia - a deprivation of oxygen - could have caused them to pass out. Search party: Jamaican Marine Police return to the Port Antonio Marina after a fruitless search for the plane that wouldn't be recovered for months . The pilot of an F-15 fighter would report that Mr. Glazer appeared to be unconscious but still breathing in the aircraft as it cruised toward the Caribbean on its own . According to ABC, the pilot requested to fly lower during two calls to air traffic control. However, when they asked if he wanted to declare himself in a state of emergency, he said no. The plane was flying at 28,000 feet at 10 am when Glazer asked to descend to 18,000 feet because of an issue with the plane, ABC reported. He was cleared to drop to 25,000 feet but then asked to go lower. Air traffic control denied the second request because of the traffic traveling below Glazer. They said if he made a left turn he could bypass the traffic and descend. He made the turn, but then stopped responding. The plane went down 14 miles north of Jamaica went it ran out of fuel.  Investigators will now use wreckage to try and determine what caused the tragedy .","Larry and Jane Glazer of Rochester, New York died--likely after passing out from oxygen deprivation--in the September 5 crash .

"When Anoop Kapitan left his home in South Africa to come to the UK in 1970, he had no idea it would be the last time he would see his brother for more than four decades. Anoop moved to Glasgow aged 20 to study at Strathclye University, but just a few years later his elder brother Karan moved to Australia, where he set up an accountancy firm. The pair kept in touch via letter, and then email, but had not seen each other face to face for 44 year until they met in Melbourne in December. Anoop had virtually given up hope of seeing his relative again after being diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1999, when doctors told him he only had ten years of normal life left. Scroll down for video . Anoop (left) and Karan Kapitan embrace as they meet each other for the first time in 44 years after they both moved away from the family home in South Africa to opposite sides of the world . Anoop studied in Glasgow before settling in Yorkshire, while Karan moved to Melbourne. When Anoop was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1999, he virtually gave up hope of seeing his brother again . Mr Kapitan said: 'My elder brother is in his late seventies now. He emigrated to Australia where he lived his life, and I lived my life in the UK. 'We both led very hectic lives – I travelled a lot with my job as a troubleshooting engineer for a big company, whilst Karan was busy establishing a successful accountancy firm in Melbourne. 'Up until this point, neither of us had the time to reconnect. 'I have travelled to 49 countries around the world including North Thailand and Turkey, so this landmark trip to Australia marked my fiftieth country.' Anoop grew up in his family home in Johannesburg where his parents ran the famous Kapitan's restaurant which was visited by Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie. Aged 20 he left to study in Glasgow, before settling in Holmfirth, Yorkshire, where he raised a family and now has two children.

A few years after he departed South Africa his brother Karan also left the family home, but he went the opposite way, travelling to Melbourne where he started a business. In 1999, while Anoop was only in his Forties, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and given just ten years to live a normal life, so he never expected to see his relative again. But Qatar Airways and Manchester Airport arranged a flight for him to Melborne, where the pair were tearfully reunited in December last year. Anoop added: 'I longed to be with family again. I don't know what kind of man I will find when I get to Australia, but I will do my utmost to win his heart again. 'I was apprehensive before meeting Karan and felt nervous and a bit overwhelmed, but when I saw him standing there at the arrivals gate all my worries just disappeared.

About 1,000 volunteers had spent four days scouring an area of more than 50 square miles in Southern California looking for Terry Dewayne Smith Jr, who disappeared July 7. His half-brother has since been charged with the boy's murder. Terry’s remains were discovered buried in a shallow grave in the backyard of his mother’s Menifee home last Wednesday after Orange County medium Pam Ragland isolated the location of the body. Accompanied by an off-duty firefighter, Ragland drove out to the Menifee home on the evening of July 9. After making the horrific discovery, the firefighter called 911 to report that they had found Terry. 'OK, we believe we may have found a human head,' the man could be heard telling a dispatcher on the call. 'We're out searching for a little boy, Terry Smith,' the local station KESQ reported. The firefighter goes on to tell the 911 operator that the 'lady' he is with 'smelled something,' and that is how they ended up finding the child's remains. Scroll down for 911 call . Charged: Skylor Atilano, 16, attends his first court appearance after being charged in the murder of his 11-year-old brother. 'He's scared,' said mom Shawna Smith . Waiting game: A judge will determine in September whether the teenager, pictured in this courtroom sketch, would be tried as a juvenile or as an adult . The dispatcher responded by telling the caller that police do not want him to disturb anything in the area, or continue their search. On Monday, Terry's 16-year-old half-brother, Skylor Atilano, attended his first court appearance after being charged last week with the murder of the 11-year-old boy, NBC Southern California reported. During the hearing at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta, Atilano's detention hearing was postponed until September 17, at which time a judge will determine whether the teenager would be tried as a juvenile or as an adult. Judge Timothy Freer said that Skylor had a 'history of violent outbursts' and that he had violated the terms of his probation. He would not elaborate on the nature of the teen's previous run-in with the law. Seated next to his lawyer wearing a yellow jumpsuit, with his mother and a number of his friends in the audience behind him, the 16-year-old showed little emotion and spoke quietly. Troubled past: A judge noted that Skylor has a history of violent outbursts and that he had violated the terms of his probation . Speaking outside the courtroom about the murder, Miguel Diaz, 15, Skylor's close friend from high school, insisted that the teen was not capable of 'doing this by himself,' according to Murrieta Patch. Kira Nichols, 16, who has been friends with Skylor since middle school, described him as an 'amazing person' who also had a smile on his face. Atilano was ordered to remain in jail ahead of his next court appearance. It is expected that the positive identification of the body found in the backyard of the Manifee residence will take anywhere from two to six weeks using DNA evidence, according to the Riverside County Coroner's Bureau. Meanwhile, a private memorial service for the slain boy will take place Saturday at Revival Christian Fellowship in Menifee. Riverside County Sheriff's Detective John Powers confirmed to a local radio station last week that Ms Ragland played a pivotal role in helping them find Terry's body following a grueling search. Powers said Ragland called a tip line about her vision, and was invited to join the search. He explained that Ragland and her children came to the house without knowing it was the boy's, walked on to the property and right to the partially buried body. Vision: Pam Ragland was volunteering during the search for the missing boy and had a 'knowing' of where she should go to look for the body . Near home: The boys lived with their mother and her partner in the home center right, and Terry's body was found in a shallow grave by the tree back to the left, only 100 feet away . Mr Powers added that he searched the area previously himself without seeing it. This . revelation came the same day that the boy's father, who lives in West . Virginia, said that Terry was not autistic and that he had spoken to him . before he disappeared when the boy asked him if he could go visit. The . 11-year-old had lived with his father, Terry Smith Sr., in West . Virginia up until 2001 when he went to live with his mother Shawna in . California. Shawna now lives in Menifee with her longterm lesbian . partner, Denise, and her son, Skylor, from a different relationship. Police have not released any official . motive for the alleged murder, but psychic Pam Ragland said that she had . a bad feeling about the half-brother. Ms Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles, was driving around Menifee with her . children in the car as they helped look for the missing boy. She told NBC Los Angeles that she had a very specific dream about the boy's whereabouts. 'I . had this knowing that he was in a certain direction and whichever way I . would turn I would know which direction to go,' she said. Arrested: Terry's half-brother, seen here, has not been publicly identified but was taken in by police on Wednesday on suspicion of Terry's murder. He was formally charged with the crime on Friday . 'That's . the building I saw in my vision, and it was very distinctive and it was . like this- it's giving me chills to even think about it now- it was . like this open tack shed.' They . went towards a fenced-in area near a tree behind the family's home and . she 'something that smelled dead'. Minutes later they spotted the top of . Terry's head poking out of the shallow grave. 'Everybody . has known Terry, if they're lucky, for five minutes; we've known him . for 11 years and we have 11 years of grieving to do,' Shawna's partner . Denise said. Reeling: Denise (pictured), Terry's mother's longterm lesbian partner, said that the family is grieving . Heartbroken: The boy's father, Terry Smith Sr (pictured), is a retired truck driver who lives in West Virginia and he said that- in spite of Shawna's claims- he did not believe his son was autistic . Shawna initially described Terry Jr. as an autistic boy who took special medication and answered only to his nickname, 'JuJu.' His father, however, insisted that his son was not autistic, saying he was a normal kid who loved video games and baseball, he said. 'He was a very bright, well-adjusted child, at least he was when he left here,' said Smith Sr., a 62-year-old retired truck driver. 'He pushed buttons and would aggravate you. But, other than that, it was just the typical way... of a typical boy trying to get his way.' Tragic: The psychic said that she knew she was close when she smelled 'something dead' In danger: Terry is pictured here, in photos sent out during the massive manhunt that ended with a psychic finding his dead body July 10 . Smith Sr. also helped raise the half brother accused in the case, even though he was not his biological father, he said. The teen, whose name has been publicly released, moved from West Virginia to California after his mother abruptly pulled him out of school, he said. 'I taught him how to walk. I helped him when he was on the baseball team here,' he said, recalling that he called the half brother 'little Spider-Man.' Investigators told Smith Sr. that Terry Jr. died after a hit to the head but declined to say more, saying he didn't want to jeopardize the investigation. 'I think him and (the half brother) got into it and it went too far,' said Smith Sr.","Terry Dewayne Smith Jr.'s mother realized her son was missing Sunday morning after his teenage half-brother babysat the night before .

"Families throw away enough food to make six meals a week, claims a damning report into waste.The average household could save up to £400 a year if everything bought was eaten . Families throw away enough food to make six meals a week, claims a damning report into waste. The average household could save up to £400 a year if everything bought was eaten rather than sent to the tip. In a stark indictment of the UK’s throwaway culture, MPs reveal in a report today that the nation as a whole dumps food worth £12.5billion a year. But a booming global population will put food supplies under severe pressure in the near future, experts claim, and there is an urgent need to tackle waste if Britain is to be kept fed. The report, compiled by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, estimates that of the 15million tons of food wasted nationally, nine million tons is completely edible. Anne McIntosh, Tory chairman of the committee, said: ‘Nine million tons of food goes into bins each year, yet a considerable proportion is fit for consumption. ‘This level of waste is unacceptable economically, socially and environmentally.’ With the global population set to hit nine billion by the end of the century, ensuring everyone has affordable, healthy food is a ‘growing challenge’, MPs on the committee warned. They said more people must be encouraged to buy British food, in order to reduce imports from abroad which can often be unreliable. But food is wasted at every stage of the food chain, the MPs’ report said. Misshapen fruit and veg is left rotting in farmers’ fields, meat quickly passes its sell-by date on supermarket shelves, and ton after ton of uneaten food is taken out of household fridges and put in the bin. The report said: ‘Half the UK’s food waste (around seven million tons) occurs in the home, with the average household throwing away the equivalent of six meals every week at a cost of £250–£400 a year.’ Farmers and other food manufacturers waste four million tons – 27 per cent of the nation’s waste. And retailers and food distributors throw away 0.4million tons – just under 3 per cent. Joanna Blythman, a food writer and expert on the British food chain, said a major part of our wasteful habit is caused by the weekly shop. She told the Daily Mail: ‘For decades, supermarkets have been encouraging us to get all of our food for a whole week in the one store. It means we stock up, but it means we throw more away. The report said: ‘Half the UK’s food waste (around seven million tons) occurs in the home, with the average household throwing away the equivalent of six meals every week at a cost of £250–£400 a year' ‘People who shop more frequently and regularly are less likely to buy food that they don’t need.’ MPs said despite the amount being thrown away, others are going hungry. The report said: ‘Food donations were used to meet the food needs of an increasing number of people. ‘The Trussell Trust estimated that some 913,000 people had received foodbank support in 2013–14. Oxfam estimates that one in six parents have gone without food themselves in order to feed their family.’ A Government spokesman said: ‘It is wrong that anyone should go hungry at the same time as food is going to waste. ‘We support industry’s action on this, and want to help them build on progress to date. This follows on from publication last year of guiding principles and research to encourage the redistribution of surplus food fit for human consumption.’ Food minister George Eustice told the committee that the Government has tried to reduce waste by changing advice on best-before dates.","Average households could save £400 a year if they ate all they bought .

"A designer has won a dispute with angry neighbours who complained about the pink door on her new fashion school. Jacqui Burke, 50, wanted to give the building in Dunbar, East Lothian, a unique touch by painting the front door in an eye-catching colour after she moved in last September. She chose a bright fuchsia pink to highlight her new working space - but it was a move that attracted a fierce backlash from locals who branded the new front as ‘absolutely vile’. Scroll down for video . Pretty in pink? Jacqui Burke (left), 50, wanted to give her fashion school in Dunbar, East Lothian, a unique touch by painting the front door (right) in an eye-catching colour after she moved in last September . And the complainers told council chiefs that Ms Burke - who has dressed singers Cher and Gloria Estefan - had ‘spoiled’ the historic B-listed Castellau House, which is in a conservation area. But, after a lengthy dispute, East Lothian Council has now told her she will not have to change the colour of her door on the building, which is the former home of the town's library. One resident said: ‘I didn't complain to the council personally as I am all for new businesses coming into the town, but I feel they have just spoiled what was once a stunning building. The local, who who wished to remain anonymous, added: ‘Any colour would have done apart from that disgusting bright pink - it is really an eyesore and not a good advert for the town.’ But Ms Burke said: ‘The reason we painted the door pink was because that colour is our brand identity. You can keep it: East Lothian Council has now told her she will not have to change the colour of her door . ‘When we moved in last year the front door was really needing done up as the paint was peeling off - but I did not expect any of this bad feeling for simply painting the entrance in a bright colour.’ Ms Burke added that a volunteer was approached by a ‘pompous’ man while she was painting the door, who was ‘very rude to her, saying that it was an absolutely vile colour’. But she insisted there had also been a lot of support in the local community. Ms Burke said: ‘I have had overwhelming public support from our community and beyond, and it was trending on our community website Heart of Dunbar. ‘There were over 300 positive comments ranging from how it made them smile when they passed it, it brightened up the town and how it is a lovely creative space where students of all ages can come and express their creativity.’ Darker colour: The door of Castellau House, which is in a conservation area, before it was painted pink . After speaking to the council, with planners even threatening to paint the door dark brown themselves, Ms Burke was pleased they decided to allow her to keep the colour. She said: ‘I am so happy that we have the support of our council, and they are moving with the times, listening to what the people actually want. ‘The complaint about the pink door has actually shown me what love and support we have in our community and how people want change. ‘It is a lovely building with a history, but it deserves some new life in it so that future artists and designers can make their own history, rather than letting yet another old building stay empty and deteriorate. ‘The building is council-owned and the fashion school is on a six-month pilot, but hopefully these complaints will not affect the final decision to allow us to stay here.’ Stars: Fashion designer Ms Burke has dressed singers Cher (left) and Gloria Estefan (right) An East Lothian Council spokeswoman said: ‘East Lothian Council received a complaint about the colour of a door on a building in Dunbar which was formerly the town's library. Jacqui Burke is from Dunbar and showcashed her designs at fashion weeks in Munich, Japan, Paris and London in the 1990s. The mother-of-three was in a charge of a 12-man design and production company and ran her own retail outlet in Kensington,  London. She has designed clothes for singers Cher and Gloria Estefan, as well as for Scottish electronic dance band The Shamen. ‘We have advised the business owner of this complaint but will not be asking for the colour to be changed.’ Her establishment, which is called ‘Fashion School’, offers 30-week courses in fashion design, teaching students design, pattern cutting and tailoring. It is a social enterprise, run with volunteers and accepts people of all ages, including those struggling to find work. Ms Burke worked as a fashion designer for a number of years, with her collections appearing on catwalks and in shops around the world, including Selfridges.","Jacqui Burke, 50, wanted to give unique touch to the building in Dunbar .

"A former Liberal Democrat peer who fell out with Nick Clegg, has put up a £600,000 fighting fund to help Ed Miliband become prime minister. Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay resigned last year after he was accused of plotting against his leader by paying for private research showing Mr Clegg would lose his seat. Last night it was revealed that the peer, who sits in the House of Lords as an independent, has bankrolled 30 Labour and 15 Lib Dem candidates to boost the chances of a Left-wing Coalition government. Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay (pictured) resigned last year after he was accused of plotting against Nick Clegg - he has now put up a £600,000 fighting fund to help Ed Miliband become prime minister . He confirmed he had donated £300,000 to Labour candidates – who received £10,000 each; and another £300,000 to 15 Lib Dem candidates, including eight current MPs contesting their seats again. Finally, he handed £10,000 to the office of the Green Party’s only MP, Caroline Lucas. The money, which has gone to candidates fighting marginal seats, is intended to halt a ‘Tory government cringing to Ukip’ and avoid a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. Lord Oakeshott said he wanted to help create a ‘Labour led government headed by Ed Miliband as prime minister’ and praised the Labour leader for resting the clamour for a vote on the EU. Lord Oakeshott  resigned last year after he was accused of plotting against his leader by paying for private research showing Nick Clegg (pictured) would lose his seat . A former close friend of business secretary Vince Cable - who he hoped would take over as party leader – the peer was a long-term thorn in the side of Mr Clegg. He was forced to step down as a Treasury spokesman in 2011 for attacking a government deal with the banks - aimed at increasing lending and reducing bonuses – as ‘pitiful and incompetent’. Since then, he repeatedly called for Mr Clegg to be sacked and the Coalition to be broken up. Last May, when he stood down from the party after the polling was revealed, he left with a parting shot accusing the Deputy Prime Minister of presiding over a ‘cash for peerages’ scandal. Mr Cable was forced to apologise for breaking parliamentary rules for not disclosing that the private polling – which cost £6,000 – had been done by his wealthy friend. Lord Oakeshott was a one-time Labour party member who stood for election in 1974 before defecting to the SDP in 1981, standing unsuccessfully for another seat two years later. Instead, he became a director of Warburg Investment Management before setting up his own property investment company. The peer has bankrolled 30 Labour and 15 Lib Dem candidates to boost the chances of a Left-wing Coalition government - creating a total £600,000 fighting fund to help Ed Miliband (pictured) become prime minister . He told the Financial Times last night that he is now a ‘non-party social democrat’ and wants to build a ‘progressive alliance’ among Labour, the Lib Dems and the Green Party. ‘Many Lib Dem and Labour candidates tell me the Tories have spent over £100,000 campaigning against them, even before the official election campaign started in December’, he said. ‘I’ve taken a leave of absence from the Lords and am just a non-party social democrat now, but I want to help save our country from a Tory government cringing to Ukip.’ The donations have been given discreetly over the past two months but are due to be made public shortly by the Electoral Commission. Lord Oakeshott said he is now a ‘non-party social democrat’ and wants to build a ‘progressive alliance’ among Labour, the Lib Dems and the Green Party . None of the Lib Dems Lord Oakeshott is bankrolling are in senior positions in the party – although ministers Danny Alexander, Jo Swinson and David Laws are likely to struggle to keep their seats. He has handed £20,000 each to eight sitting MPs in marginal seats on the left wing of the party such as John Pugh – the only Lib Dem MP to openly call for Mr Clegg’s resignation, and Norman Baker who resigned as a home office minister. A further seven candidates have received £20,000 each. Mr Cable is not one of them. He is funding Labour candidate Will Straw, the son of Jack Straw who is standing in the marginal Rossendale and Darwen seat held by Tory MP Jack Berry. Also the Labour candidates in Hastings and Rye, where Conservative Treasury minister Amber Rudd is defending a slim majority, and Great Grimsby, in Lincolnshire where veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell is standing down and Ukip have been tipped to win the seat. ‘Britain stands on the edge of a cliff with the general election only 105 days away’, he said. ‘Will we vote Tory or Ukip for Euro referendum chaos, lasting two years at least and putting thousands of businesses, millions of jobs and our long term peace and security at risk? ‘Or will Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green and all progressive voters come together in the marginal seats that matter to elect a Parliament for progress and reform and a Labour-led Government with Ed Miliband as prime minister? ‘He has stood firm against the clamour for a referendum with considerable courage and nous. Scotland shows how referenda, even with 55-45 vote, can settle nothing, just open a can of worms.’ A Lib Dem source last night said: ‘It’s not surprising, Lord Oakeshott has been on a path to destruction since he resigned. 'He has apparently left politics but clearly couldn’t help himself. 'Money can get you so far in politics, but only if you have a leader who connects with people and the right policies in place.’","Lord Oakeshott was Liberal Democrat peer until he fell out with Nick Clegg .

"A Reverend who was dumped in a vacant lot when she was a baby has been reunited with the police officer who rescued her more than 50 years on. Toni DiPina was abandoned by her parents among rusting cars and appliances on a disused patch of ground in St Louis, Missouri, when she was nine months old. Today, no-one has ever come forward to claim her and, for decades, all she knew of the day that  changed her life forever was a report by officer George Leuckel who was called to collect her. Now, for the first time, they have enjoyed an emotional reunion to share the unique bond they had carried with them during their very separate lives. Emotional reunion: Reverend Toni DiPina meets retired St Louis police officer George Leuckel for the first time since he found her abandoned in a St Louis parking lot more than 50 years ago . Mr Leuckel, now 79, said he seriously considered adopting her, but felt it would not be possible to take in a black baby in the deeply segregated St Louis of 1963. 'The thought had crossed my mind to take her home, but there was no way you could do that back then,' he told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Mrs DiPina, now 51, was discovered by two boys in a vacant lot off Bell Avenue on May 26, 1963. What wasn't mentioned in the official police reports was the immediate connection that was forged when Mr Leuckel first scooped her up. Close bond: Mr Leuckel, now 79, said he seriously considered adopting Mrs DiPina after finding her, but felt it would not be possible to take in a black baby in the deeply segregated St Louis of 1963 . Detailing the encounter in full for the first time, Mr Leuckel said the baby stared at him quietly without crying and then clutched him when he took her to be assessed at the nearby hospital. She was later taken to an emergency foster home and they lost contact. After a troubled upbringing, Mrs DiPina went on to become a nanny with a respectable family in central Massachusetts, going on to gain a college degree and bringing up a family of her own. She later became a pastor. Mrs DiPina, now 51, was discovered by two boys in a vacant lot off Bell Avenue (above) in St Louis in 1963 . In 2008, she read a report in the St Louis Post-Dispatch of a boy who was abandoned in very similar circumstances. She came forward to tell her story in the hope it might encourage someone to come forward for the boy and herself, but neither did. Then, last year, she decided to launch another appeal on Facebook - and called Mr Leuckel for the first time. They finally met on January 3 at the Oakville condominium Mr Leuckel shares with his wife Barbara and their daughter, named, coincidentally, Toni.","Toni DiPina was dumped among rusting cars by her parents in 1963 .

"A former Miss Turkey could be jailed for two years for posting a satirical poem on social media that criticised her country's president. The arrest of Merve Buyuksarac, 26, follows a crackdown in the country on critical media in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris as well as a increasing curbs on press freedoms in the country. Miss Buyuksarac is the latest person to face trial for insulting Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who recently said women are not equal to men - amid fears that the country is in danger of coming under authoritarian rule. Emre Telci, who is representing the former Miss Turkey, said an Istanbul prosecutor is demanding that Merve Buyuksarac be prosecuted on charges of insulting a public official. If she is convicted she could face a two year prison sentence. Facing trial: Former Miss Turkey Merve Buyuksarac (left) has been arrested for posting a satirical poem on social media that criticises the country's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan (right) Her case comes amid further controls being placed on people in Turkey - with curbs on press freedoms and social media posts. Hundreds of people who have taken part in mass protests against the government have also been prosecuted. Armed Turkish police last week stopped delivery lorries leaving a newspaper's offices to make sure that they had not included a section of the French satirical magazine  that might be offensive to Muslims. Although officially Turkey is secular, 99.8 per cent of the population are registered as Muslim and there has been heated debate over freedom of expression in the wake of the Paris massacres. Now it appears the Turkish crackdown is extending not just to monitoring the media, but also to its readers. Miss Buyuksarac, an educated young professional who works as an industrial designer and writer, was detained last month for sharing a satirical poem on her Instagram account, and has denied insulting the president. The 26-year-old ended up in court in the Caglayan neighbourhood of the western city of Istanbul. Looking nervous and flanked by armed police, she told prosecutors that she 'may have quoted a poem' from the weekly humour magazine Uykusuz. But she said she deleted it soon afterwards when one of her friends warned that such messages could result in a criminal procedure from Turkish officials. 'Found it funny': Buyuksarac (pictured, right, with a friend) told prosecutors she 'may have quoted a poem' from weekly humour magazine Uykusuz, but said she deleted it soon afterwards over fears it may be a crime . She said: 'I shared it because I found it funny. I had no intention to insult the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.' The Master's Poem, which was shared by Buyuksarac, satirically criticises Erdogan through verses adapted from the lyrics of Turkey's national anthem. The case is continuing and prosecutor Vedat Yigit demanded 'judicial control' for Buyuksarac before the next hearing, which obliges a suspect to regularly go to a police station to sign in. The judge, however, ruled to release Buyuksarac unconditionally, pending a date for the trial set to take place later in the year. Anger: Dozens of protesters gathered to vent their fury earlier this month at the Cumhuriyet newspaper in Turkey, which included cartoons and articles from Charlie Hebdo's latest 'survivor' edition . It came as a high school student who was jailed last month for allegedly insulting Turkey's leader was released from custody on Friday after his arrest caused uproar and intensified fears that Turkey was lurching toward more authoritarian rule under Erdogan. Turkey last week blocked access to the web pages of some online news portals for republishing the cover of the Charlie Hebdo magazine's latest issue that portrays the Prophet Mohammed, labelling it provocative. Deputy Prime Minister Yalcin Akdogan also lashed out at cartoons featuring the Prophet, saying that targeting the sacred values of Muslims and publishing portrayals of the Prophet was an 'open provocation'.

"She is the daughter of one of the most notorious dictators in the world, and a woman who has openly pledged her support for ISIS. But that doesn't mean Raghad Saddam Hussein doesn't have an eye for design, as she hopes to prove with her new jewellery range - complete with pieces unshamedly inspired by her despot father, as well as the husband he had murdered. Sold in one of Jordan's finest jewellery stores, the rings, bracelets and necklaces even feature a £1,000 pendent in the shape of Iraq, MailOnline can reveal. Exactly why the 46-year-old - known as 'Little Saddam', for her similarities to her father - has decided to move into the jewellery business is unclear. But the boastful interview, in a Jordanian sales brochure, has emerged as new controversy rages over the delaying of the Iraq Inquiry in Britain. Scroll down for video . Raghad Saddam Hussein has decided to turn her hand to jewellery with a nostalgic collection, featuring pieces inspired by her father and late husband . Raghad (top centre) has been a vocal defender of Saddam (front, next to wife Dajiba in November 1988) since he was captured, and later executed . This £1,320 turquoise bracelet is modeled on one Raghad had made using a precious stone her father gave her as a gift. She said: 'My dad Saddam Hussein gave me this turquoise many years ago and I kept it safe until three years ago' Raghad explains: 'Baghdad is the heart of Iraq. I chose to place a diamond in its place and you can chose to change the location of the stone' The publication of the Chilcot Report has been delayed until after the British general election in May after those criticised were given the opportunity to respond. Among the 10-piece collection is a £1,320 turquoise bracelet designed to match one she created from a gift Saddam had given her. 'My dad Saddam Hussein gave me this turquoise many years ago and I kept it safe until three years ago,' revealed Raghad in a sales brochure for her wares. 'I chose to place it in this bracelet and create a similar design for those who like this design and want to keep it.' And, if the jewellery is an insight into what Raghad values, then there is one other piece which seems to have special significance: a pendant in the shape of Iraq. 'Baghdad is the heart of Iraq. I chose to place a diamond in its place,' she revealed. Also among the collection - on sale at an exclusive jewellers in Amman, Jordan, her home since the end of the Iraq war - is a pair of earrings Raghad created, originally, for her daughters from a ring her late husband Hussein Kamel al-Majid gave her. She said: 'I designed this earing for one of my daughters, and it was taken from a ring that my late husband Hussein gave me long time ago. I decided to change to from a ring to an earring and then I created this design for those who like its shape.' The fact both men are included in this rather nostalgic collection is an odd decision. After all, Saddam had Hussein killed back in 1996, having promised his son-in-law forgiveness on his return to Iraq after he defected to Jordan in 1995. Raghad had divorced him days before; it is said he has been edited out of family pictures. But this is one of many contradictions in Raghad's life. Raghad modelled this pair of earrings on a pair she had made for her daughter, using a ring she was given by her late husband Hussein Kamel al-Majid (pictured with Raghad, left) - a man her father had killed . Despite the fact Saddam had her husband killed, Raghad (pictured here as a young girl with her father) found it in herself to forgive him . Raghad is Saddam's oldest daughter. By the time she was ten years old, Saddam was president of Iraq - a position he would hold until she was forced to flee in 2003. Raghad - who is said to be an avid reader of Hello! magazine - had her first child, a boy named Ali, by the age of 16, having married Hussein, then supervisor of Saddam's Republican Guard, in 1983. By the age of 26, she had had four more: boys Saddam and Wahej, and girls Haris and Banan. She is, by all accounts, a woman used to the finer things in life: her extravagent lifestyle while living in Jordan has raised some eyebrows. Her love of designer labels is legendary: she is said to pay for Gucci handbags and £400 Sergio Rossi boots with a thick wads of crisp US dollars. A falcon ring, to represent 'simple of strength and beauty', and a 'special ring, to be given to the best the most precious people in our lives' A snake bracelet in gold and silver and Raghad's favourite piece as 'it was done as a model for my work'. The letter L, she explains, can be changed upon request . Flower-inspired bracelets in white and blue will mkae a pretty gift, while the simple rectangular pendant is designed to be given to a loved one and engraved appropriately . 'She buys shoes by the sack load,' a woman close to Raghad's tight circle of friends told the Daily Mail in 2006. But it is not just her clothes Raghad likes to spend money on: she is also famous for her love of plastic surgery, and is said to have had extensive work done with one of the top surgeons in Jordan. Her daily regime - during which she is chauffeured around - is said to include a trip to the gym, beauty parlour and, of course, the shops. Indeed, when the news of her father's failed appeal, and imminent execution reached her, she was apparently sat in an Amman beauty parlour awaiting a hot stone beauty scrub. However, exactly where this money comes from is not known. Some in Jordan - where she has lived as a 'guest' of the royal family since leaving Iraq - believe she is being funded by her hosts, much to their annoyance. Saddam and his family: Raghad is pictured third right, next to her brother Uday (centre). He and Qussay (far right) were both killed in 2003, before Raghad fled with her family to Jordan . Saddam with  Raghad's oldest son Ali, when he was aged two. Raghad has raised her children to respect the memory of their grandfather . But recently, it is a more devout image she has been keen to portray to the wider world. For Raghad has seen a way back to her beloved Iraq - and that way is ISIS, despite the fact she is far from the extremist group's idea of an ideal woman. Veterans of Saddam's Baathist party are said to see the militants as allies of sorts, and Raghad would very much like to follow in her father's footsteps. Baathists have even been helping ISIS take control of towns in northern Iraq. She expressed delight after militants captured Tikrit, her father’s hometown, last year, telling Jordanian newspaper Al-Quds: 'These are victories of my father’s fighters and my uncle Izzat Al-Douri.' It isn't the first time Raghad has been linked to terrorism. In 2010, Interpol issued an arrest warrant, accusing her of funding terrorism in her native Iraq. Raghad has been vocal in her support of ISIS, speaking to a Jordanian newspaper of her 'delight' when the militants took Saddam's home town of Tikrit . She was also ranked number 16 on the American's most-wanted list in 2007, while her mother was number 17. Both times, the Jordanian royal family refused to give her up. And while she may not practice the overt violence her two older brothers, Uday and Qusay, would become known, Raghad is known for her sharp tongue. 'The store owners are wary of her because she can be a difficult customer and nothing is ever good enough for her,' the Mail's source said in 2006. 'There's a shop in Amman called Boutique de Francais that she goes to frequently where the staff are terrified of her.' Raghad is also not a woman who is happy to stand in the shadows - something which has upset her wider family at times. It was Raghad who took the helm of the family after her older brothers' deaths in 2003, securing the lawyers who would fight for her father in court from exile in Jordan. She became known for her impassioned defence of Saddam, who was captured by American troops in December 13, 2003. Raghad appeared on television invited the world's press into her home as she continued to defend her father - the man who, just seven years before, had had her husband killed. 'He was a very good father, loving, had a big heart, loved his daughters, sons, grandchildren,' Raghad told CNN in 2003. 'He was the one we always go to.' Ragdad's son Ali, who has been living in exile with his mother in Amman, in Jordan . Raghad is known for her extravagant lifestyle, and appeared to spare little expense for her daughter Banin's wedding last year . In an interview with The Telegraph the next year, it was revealed her home had been turned into a 'shrine' to him. 'Visitors ushered through the front door by a Filipina maid find themselves staring at a painting of the deposed dictator,' it noted. It was Raghad who fought to have her father's body buried in Yemen until Iraq was 'liberated' from American forces. Women who met Raghad at the school gate were also surprised at how openly she spoke of her beloved father. One revealed to the Mail in 2006: 'I remember telling her that I was taking one of my kids out of the school and moving her to the British international school because she was struggling with English. 'I asked how her children were getting on with English and she said they were doing great. 'Then she said something extraordinary: ""Can you really imagine the grandchildren of Saddam Hussein not being able to speak English?"".' Her admiration for Saddam has clearly not diminished in the years since his death, as the jewellery clearly shows. As for what that might mean for the country of her birth, time will only tell.","Raghad Hussein's  collection also includes pieces inspired by Iraq .

"Police in Minnesota are investigating if a man wheeled his dead mother into a bank to withdraw funds in her name just hours before he reported her deceased. Up until her death two weeks ago, Caryl Vanzo, 90, had been living with her son David at his home in Plymouth. But just seven hours before he called local police to report his mom's death, the pair took a taxi to a local branch of Wells Fargo where they withdrew $850. David Vanzo denies that his mother was already dead when he took her to the bank and claims the $850 was from a joint account. He was arrested for elderly neglect after his mother's death two week ago . Bank employees recalled seeing Caryl's feet dragging under the wheelchair and were unsure if she was breathing. A search warrant citing the employees says she 'did not move' and employees 'couldn't tell if she was breathing.' A neighbor who saw them leave in the taxi also wondered if Caryl was dead. 'I don't know if she was unconscious, or not alive,' the neighbor told FOX 9. Police responding to David's call that his mom was dead arrived at the home to find Caryl in bed, wearing a robe and fur coat. They reported that she smelled of urine and her boots were covered in human feces.

"The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the watchdog responsible for preventing the use of chemical weapons. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), is working to destroy Syria's massive chemical weapons stockpile after a sarin gas strike in the suburbs of Damascus killed more than 1,400 people in August. The Pakistan Taliban have said they are 'delighted' that Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old schoolgirl they tried to kill, missed out on the award after being widely tipped to win. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Damascus agreed to destroy all its chemical weapons after Washington threatened to use force in response to the killing of hundreds of people in a sarin attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 . Malala Yousafzai, 16, was shot in the head on a school bus by the Taliban for championing women's right to education and was widely tipped to win the award . Spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said the campaigner for women's education had done nothing to deserve the Nobel. He said: 'We are delighted that she didn't get it. She did nothing big so it's good that she didn't get it. 'This award should be given to the real Muslims who are struggling for Islam. Malala is against Islam, she is secular.' The 16-year-old who moved to Birmingham after she was shot in the head by the Taliban for championing girls' right to education. A petition for Malala to be short-listed attracted more than half a million signatures from across the globe. On . Thursday, the teenager was awarded the European Union's highest human . rights honour, the Sakharov Award, whose previous recipients have . included past Nobel prize winners the former South African president . Nelson Mandela and Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi. Malala has earned plaudits across the . world for her bravery and determination since recovering from a failed . assassination attempt by the Pakistani Taliban in October last year in . which she was shot in the head as she travelled with classmates on a . school bus. Only because . of emergency medical treatment in Pakistan, and an airlift to the Queen . Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, did she survive the attack. Since . the age of 11, Malala has campaigned for the right to education for . girls in her country - something the Taliban has strongly opposed. Despite the attempt on her life, she has continued to champion children's access to the classroom. She now claims that her ambition is to become Prime Minister after her dreams of winning the Nobel Prize were quashed. Elsewhere more furious critics have branded the decision an 'award to Assad' saying the prize is supporting the regime accusing the judges of being premature. One Twitter activist called Shami Witness said: 'They are insulting the martyrs, intentional humiliation of the victims. This is an award to Assad and Putin.' The OPCW is tasked with upholding the Chemical Weapons Convention which prohibits the production and use of chemical weapons . Meanwhile human rights workers . pointed out that the organisation had been given the award in the one . year during its 16-year existence when chemical weapons had been used on . a mass scale. Nadim Houry, director of the Beirut office of Human Rights Watch, said: 'I would have thought 2013 would have been a year for soul searching at OPCW, not accolades.' In August the world was shocked by images of thousands of pale bodies, many of them children, beamed across the globe following a sarin nerve gas attack in Damascus. Warheads landed in the suburbs of Ain Tarma, Zamalka and Jobar just before dawn, meaning many of the victims died in their beds. Since then the Syrian rebels and government have pointed the finger of blame at one another, while Russia and the US have agreed a peace plan which will see the destruction of President Assad's chemical weapons stockpile. The OPCW have been handed the task, which they say could take months to complete. It is not the first time in the prize's history that it has courted controversy. In 2009 the committee drew criticism after deciding to give the award to US President Barack Obama as a calling to make sure his Presidency lived up to the high standards set during his first election campaign. Since then, much to the ire of activists, Guantanamo Bay prison has remained open, drone strikes in Pakistan have intensified and America has maintained a military presence in Afghanistan.","Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has won prize .

"He is the legendary fashion designer who this week icily declared: 'I have no family.' Multi-millionaire Karl Lagerfeld said that he saw his entourage of male models as his real 'family' - and that although he had a sister in the United States, he suggested they had no relationship. But in fact the Daily Mail Online can reveal the Chanel designer has a sister living in rural Connecticut who dotes on the fashion icon, and is ready to pop out to get his favorite Coca Cola if he comes to visit. Christiane Johnson, 83, treasures her younger brother, and although she has not seen him since the 1970s, follows his career with affection - and keeps his achievements in pride of place in her modest home. The grandmother-of-six pores over magazines for news of his successes and collecting photos and cuttings about his jet set lifestyle. Scroll down for video . Family: Baptiste Giabiconi, Karl Lagerfeld, and Brad Kroenig at a French AIDS benefit in 2010. Lagerfeld says his entourage of young male models is his real family - especially his longterm muse, Kroenig, of St Louis, MO . Real family: Christiane Johnson, of Portland, Connecticut, lives modestly but is actually Lagerfeld's closest family member - and keeps in touch with him while following his brilliant fashion career . Paris-based Lagerfeld, 81 - worth an estimated $125 million - told The New York Times last week that he prefers his entourage of male models to his relatives. He said: 'I see them like family. I have no family at all, so it's good to have, like, sons but without the unpleasant problems sons can create. 'It's a choice, it's not an obligation. There's a big difference. I have a sister in America who I haven't seen for 40 years. Her children never even send me a Christmas card.' But for his sister, it is just how the brother she is proud of is - and she is not taking it as a slight. Mrs Johnson, 83, remains hopeful that her brother will one day visit her blue collar hometown of Portland to meet his great nieces and nephews for the first time. Speaking from her two-bed $260,000 home beside the Connecticut River, Mrs Johnson told Daily Mail Online: 'I enjoy looking through the magazines and looking at the clothes - I've never worn any of them. 'I haven't seen him since the 1970s but people bring me articles and I keep them all. 'I'm not angry, I know he's really busy. He lives over there and I live here - it's just one of those things. 'I have the phone number for his kitchen but that doesn't do me any good. Then there's the six-hour time difference. Distant but close: 'He lives over there and I live over here,' says Christiane Johnson of her brother, Karl Lagerfeld, whom she has not seen since the 1970s . Treasured: Christiane Johnson remains fiercely proud of the brother she has not seen for 40 years or so and keeps letters and other souvenirs from him, saying he is just 'busy' Pride of place: Artifacts from her brother's life in fashion cover the walls of Christiane Johnson's Connecticut home and she looks forward to him visiting again, saying she would get him his favorite Diet Coke . 'He's knows I've got grandchildren. My children don't remember too much about him. They would like to meet him again - we all would.' The two siblings grew up in the German city of Hamburg, where their father, Otto Ludwig Lagerfeldt, worked for a milk firm and their mom, Elisabeth, was reportedly a lingerie saleswoman. Mrs Johnson remembers her brother as a precociously-talented young artist who preferred to paint quietly in the family attic rather than play with other children. 'As soon as he could hold a pencil he would paint,' she recalled. 'He would love to find old pictures and paint on the other side of the canvas. 'He liked to read, he was intelligent and thoughtful. He would be up in the attic painting while I was playing in the street. 'He was obviously artistic but to me he was just a kid brother.' Lagerfeld left Germany to study at the prestigious Lycée Montaigne in Paris and was hired as Pierre Balmain's assistant after winning the coat section of a 1955 competition sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat. Glamor: At 81 Lagerfeld enjoys the trappings of success, including a private jet. His godson, on whom he dotes, is Hudson Kroenig, right the son of model muse Brad, and the boy calls the designer 'Uncle Karl'. But Lagerfeld has never met his great-nephews and nieces, once of whom is four, a year younger than Hudson . Center of fashion world: Cara Delevingne and Georgia May Jagger plant a kiss on Karl Lagerfeld at Fendi's Spring Summer 2015 collection in Milan last Septemner . He would go on to design for fashion houses including Chloe, Fendi and Chanel, becoming as recognizable for his trademark white ponytail, starched collars and dark sunglasses as his pioneering clothes. 'The first pictures I saw of his designs were when his coat was in the papers after the contest,' added Mrs Johnson. 'He would come back and visit but after he became known in Paris I would see less and less of him.' Mrs Johnson herself moved to the US in 1957 and became an au pair for a family in Seattle. There, she met her late husband Robert, a WWII Navy veteran and tax inspector. The couple relocated to the East Coast to start a family in smalltown Portland, which has a population of 9,000. They had four children, Caroline, Roger, Paul and a third son - named Karl after his uncle - who died tragically at 18 when he fell off his motorbike. Mrs Johnson last saw her brother in the late 70s when he flew to the US and swept into tiny Portland in the back of a black limousine, sporting his now trademark dark glasses. 'That was the time when limousines were a bit special,' she recalled. 'The whole town saw a limousine come through - that was really something. I think he had his glasses on. Small town: Portland, CT, has just 9,000 inhabitants - but back in the 1970s welcomed Karl Lagerfeld, who stepped out of the back of his limousine and turned heads as he visited his sister . Welcome: Christiane Johnson, 83, says her brother Karl Lagerfeld would be welcome at any time at her modest home in Connecticut, and she would be happy to get in his favorite Coke for when he comes . The family resemblance, despite their different lives and long separation, is undeniable - especially in the mouth . Souvenir: Last August Lagerfeld sent a letter which included a signed photograph of him with his pet cat . In touch: Despite saying he has no family, Lagerfeld wrote to his sister last year . 'He stayed just for the afternoon. I went over to visit him a couple of years later, I think. But it's so long ago now I can hardly recall it. 'Things are complicated. You have to have an airplane to go to France and when they come here it's so programmed that he doesn't have time for anything. 'He's very busy - how else do you make that sort of money? You can only do so much.' Mrs Johnson and her brother occasionally exchange letters, most recently in August, when the designer posted her a large portrait photo and a note, handwritten in German and headed with his silver embossed 'KL' initials. But when her husband of 54 years Robert died aged 92 on Christmas Eve she did not invite Lagerfeld to the funeral because she doubted he would be able to interrupt his schedule to attend. Lagerfeld's productivity is renowned within the fashion industry and despite his old age he still designs 17 collections a year for Chanel, Fendi and his own Karl Lagerfeld line. He hinted at it in the letter he sent his sister last summer, writing: 'I just cannot believe that you will be 83 and I will soon turn 81. 'Yet I am busier and more successful than ever. That is really incredible. Normally, people like me are retired for a long time but all of my deals (Chanel, Fendi etc.) are for life.' His inner circle includes long-term muse Brad Kroenig, a married 35-year-old model from St Louis, Missouri - whose son Hudson is Lagerfeld's godson - the British model Jake Davies, 34, and Baptiste Giabiconi, a 25-year-old from France. Kid brother: Lagerfeld's career begin in Paris in 1954 and since then he has become one of the world's most successful designers - to the pride of his Connecticut sister . Way he was: Lagerfeld as he was in 1973, close to the time he and his sister last met. He is holding a glass which appears to contain his favorite Coke - which Christiane Johnson says she would be happy to serve him . The pile of Karl souvenirs is treasured in her home . Mrs Johnson would love him to share some of his time  with her beloved grandchildren - Jessica, 19, Collin, 17, Andrew, 14, Jonathan, 13, Anthony, five and Alyssa, four. But she refutes any suggestions of bitterness and says her brother is welcome to pop by anytime for a glass of his favorite drink - Diet Coke. 'I read the stories about him in the papers but I don't pay attention to the negative things,' she said. 'He's my brother and I'm proud of his success. 'I know that he only drinks Coca Cola. I will make sure I go get some if he comes to visit.'","German-born designer, 81, told New York Times his entourage is his real family and were 'sons, without the unpleasant obligations sons create'

"Falling asleep on a stranger has been named as the 'most awkward' situation on board a plane. It's one of those incidents where if it's you using your neighbour's shoulder for a nap there's deep embarrassment, but when others do it, it's a platform of entertainment. New research by a flight comparison website in the UK has discovered the top 10 most awkward scenarios that Britons have encountered or witnessed whilst travelling by air. Scroll down for video . If you woke up yourself to find someone asleep on you, it would certainly be rather awkward . And falling asleep on a random stranger on-board the same flight tops the list of most commonly seen or experienced. As many as three quarters of Britons have come across an awkward situation during a flight before, research from flight comparison website www.Jetcost.co.uk has revealed. 1. Falling asleep on a stranger - 65% . 2. Dropping overhead luggage/items onto the passenger sat below - 61% . 3. Arguments/confusion over seat allocations - 54% . 4. Falling onto a fellow passenger accidentally - 50% . 5. Embarrassing bodily functions (breaking wind, burping) - 49% . 6. Dribbling whilst asleep - 48% . 7. Lovers’ tiff/couple arguing - 36% . 8. Walking in on someone on the loo (or being walked in on) - 29% . 9. Screaming/misbehaving children - 22% . 10. Travel sickness - 14% . Almost 2,500 Britons aged 18 and over, all of whom stated that they had flown at least once in the past two years, were quizzed about any embarrassing encounters or experiences they may have had or witnessed whilst flying. All respondents were asked if they had ever encountered any particularly awkward situations during a flight (either that they had witnessed or experienced themselves), to which just over three quarters admitted that they had. When provided with a list of possibly awkward scenarios and asked to select all those they'd witnessed or experienced, the most common, awkward in-flight scenario was seeing a passenger fall asleep on a stranger. Not far behind in the ranking table was dropping items on a passenger (61 per cent), followed in third by arguments over seating (54 per cent). According to the poll, when witnessing an awkward situation, almost three fifths of respondents, 61 per cent, admitted that that they couldn't help but 'watch as the incident unfolded', with the remaining respondents stating they either 'shared awkward glances with fellow passengers' (21 per cent) or tended to 'awkwardly look away, pretending not to notice what's going on' (18 per cent). A screaming child on a plane, not surprisingly, makes the list of the most awkward situations . Wanting to determine if Britons encountered more awkward situations than others from within Europe, 1,000 respondents in total from France, Germany, Italy and Spain were quizzed about their experiences, with an even 25 per cent split from each country. All respondents were asked 'Have you encountered or experienced any particularly awkward situations during a flight before?' Like the British, 64 per cent of Spanish respondents had encountered or experienced awkward or uncomfortable situations on-board a flight, whilst only 21 per cent from Germany, 18 per cent from Italy and nine per cent from France had been so unfortunate. Couples arguing has been spotted by 36 per cent of plane travellers, who often listen on for laughs . Antoine Michelat, co-founder of Jetcost.co.uk, said: 'We're a little shocked that a couple of instances of arguing and fighting made it into the top ten, but then when you're a long flight with limited space for movement it's no surprise that tempers can flare. 'It's always wise to remember where you are though and how much trouble you can get into for becoming a nuisance – it wouldn't be the first time a pilot has had to divert a plane to remove a nuisance passenger. 'No matter how embarrassing, sometimes we just can't help but watch as others are put into awkward situations, just to see how it plays out – there's no better place to do this than on a flight where you're confined to a limited space with lots of random strangers. 'However, it is undoubtedly a completely different story when you find yourself stuck in one of these situations and you have tonnes of eyes peering out at you.'","Dropping luggage and falling into seated people also make top 10 list .
But these awkward situations provide entertainment if not involved .
Stats show that the French experience the least awkward plane journeys ."
"Comedian Larry Wilmore didn't pulling any punches when he launched into a scathing attack on Bill Cosby and the growing number of sexual assault allegations against him in the second episode of his new show. Wilmore, host of The Nightly Show which has just replaced Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central, began Tuesday's episode by telling viewers that the show would be all about Cosby. 'Tonight we are talking about Cosby,' Wilmore said. 'We're answering the question, did he do it? The answer will be yes.' Scroll down for more . Comedian Larry Wilmore didn't pulling any punches when he launched into a scathing attack on Bill Cosby and the growing number of sexual assault allegations against him in his new show . 'There's a statute of limitations on the charges, but there's no statute of limitations on my opinion, and I'm telling you, that motherf***** did it,' he added. Wilmore joked about Cosby's ill-advised decision to name his tour Far From Finished and then posed a question about the allegations that has baffled him the most. 'Why aren't people listening to these women?' he asked. 'Is it because most of this allegedly happened so long ago? Is it because some of them went into Cosby's hotel room alone? Is it because there are no Polaroids? Is it because he's so famous? Or is it just because they're women?' Wilmore said 35 women have since come forward to allege Cosby had sexually assaulted them. Wilmore joked about Cosby's ill-advised decision to name his tour Far From Finished . 'Really folks, how many do we need?' the 53-year-old late night host asked. 'Let's understand this number. That's like if Bill Cosby drugged and raped every single U.S. president from George Washington to John F. Kennedy!' The Emmy-winning writer also said he felt it was in 'poor taste' for Cosby to continue with his tour. 'The worst place for him to address these allegations is the stage,' said Wilmore. Wilmore then ran a clip of Cosby getting heckled during one of his recent shows in Canada. From the stage Cosby can be heard meekly answering back: 'Stop it. Stop it. That's right…shh…shh. No clapping, nothing. That's all right.' 'Are you trying to quiet a heckler or is that your pillow talk?' joked Wilmore. Nightly Show contributor Mike Yard then joined in. 'I've been doing comedy for 20 years. I've seen a lot of alleged criminals on stage. That doesn't mean your act has to be sloppy,' said Yard. 'If you can't handle a Canadian heckler, it's time to get out of the game.' Wilmore also took a moment during the show to reflect on the possibility that the allegations against the entertainer could be false. 'Let's consider for a second that Cosby didn't do it,' he said. 'OK, we're done.'","Wilmore launched a scathing attack on Bill Cosby and the growing number of sexual assault allegations against him .

"There is little to differentiate the two orange-suited men kneeling alongside each other in ISIS's latest hostage video. But a closer look at the Japanese nationals reveals one thought he was the reincarnation of a cross-dressing Japanese princess - while the other is a Christian convert who some fear felt he needed to save him. Journalist Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa both appeared in the latest ISIS video, in which the terror group warns they will be beheaded unless their government pays a $200million ransom by Friday. But as the men wait to hear their fate, a picture of two very different people thrown together in war-torn Syria by chance a little less than a year ago has started to emerge. Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa both appeared in the latest ISIS video, where a man - believed to be Jihadi John - threatened to behead them if Japan did not pay a $200million ransom for their safe release . Yukawa, 42, was the first to be captured sometime after July 21, the date of his last blog post, having arrived in Syria earlier in the year. His arrival in the Middle East followed a number of difficult years, which appeared to begin in 2005, when his business failed, leaving him in debt and, at one point, reportedly homeless. By his own account, he had changed his name to the feminine-sounding Haruna, and attempted to kill himself by cutting off his genitals in 2008, likening the act to the ritual suicide of a samurai. 'I thought if I failed I would live as a woman and leave the rest to destiny,' he wrote later. He was saved by his wife, who died of cancer two years later. Yukawa would also come to believe his was the reincarnation of a cross-dressing Manchu princess, who had spied for Japan in World War Two. By late 2013, Yukawa had begun a flirtation with Japan's extreme right-wing politics and cultivated a new persona as a self-styled security consultant, according to his Facebook page and blog posts, though he never did any work as a consultant. Yukawa, pictured here preparing to fire an AK47, has previously claimed to be the reincarnation of a cross-dressing princess, who spied for Japan during the Second World War . Yukawa - who tried to commit suicide by cutting off his genitals in about 2008 - traveled to Syria after 'his life reached its limit', according to his father . He borrowed money to travel to Syria and dreamed of providing security to big Japanese companies in conflict areas like the coast of Somalia. The Syrian civil war was a new start – and his last chance to make a success in life, he told friends and family. Later this year, he planned to head to Somalia 'where the danger factor will be amped up'. 'He felt his life had reached its limit,' said Yukawa's father, Shoichi, 74. Yukawa had hoped Private Military Company would be a success, but Nobuo Kimoto, a retired former local assembly who also served as an adviser to Yukawa's business, had reservations. 'His idea sounded interesting at the beginning, but he had no money or experience,' said Kimoto, who described Yukawa as a 'gentle, likable person'. It seems Goto also picked up on his lack of experience when the pair met last April, after Yukawa had been caught and detained by an anti-government militant group  Free Syrian Army, or FSA. After that first meeting, Goto - an experienced reporter who have covered many war zones - described Yukawa as 'hapless'. He had set up a company, but those who met him - including Goto - felt he lacked experience . 'He needed someone with experience to help him,' Goto told Reuters in August. It is said his subsequent abduction haunted Goto. ""I need to go there at least once and see my fixers and ask them what the current situation is. I need to talk to them face to face. I think that's necessary,"" Goto said, referring to locals who work freelance for foreign correspondents, setting up meetings and helping with the language. Goto, 47, was in Syria with his video news company Independent Press, which mainly covered conflicts, poverty, refugees and children in war zones. He also worked with UN organizations including UNICEF and the UN refugee agency. But unlike Yukawa, it was not the glamour of war which attracted him to Syria. Friend Toshi Maeda, also a freelance journalist, said:'Children, the poor and the needy, those are where he is coming from. 'He just wants to meet children in conflicted areas and tell the rest of the world their suffering. Goto is a devout Christian who worried about Yukawa after meeting him in Syria in April . 'As he follows their stories, he ends up in war zones.' His former pastor Hiroshi Tamura said the fatherof-two is motivated in his work by his Christian faith, describing Goto as a journalist who always stood on the side of little people in dangerous areas. Friends now fear Goto may have gone looking for Yukawa during a trip to Syria in late October - the trip he never returned from. Maeda revealed he said nothing about looking for the captured Yukawa, but he now wonders if his friend did try to find Yukawa while he was in the area as reported by some Japanese media - and was captured in the process. However, what does seem likely is that Goto will be turning to his faith in captivity. The devout Christian, who converted in 1997, has previously spoken openly about his religion. 'I have seen horrible places and have risked my life, but I know that somehow God will always save me,' the father-of-two said in a May article for the Japanese publication Christian Today. He told the same publication he never risked anything dangerous, citing a passage in the Bible, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test'.","Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa threatened with beheading in ISIS video .

"An adventurous photographer, Kent Mearig, couldn't resist scaling a 50-foot deep ice crevasse - simply because it lay within the city limits of his hometown. With an ice axe in hand, the 33-year-old local resident drove, kayaked and trekked the 10 miles from his home in Alaska's capital, Juneau, to the Mendenhall Glacier, so that he could enjoy the simple thrill of exploring one of nature's most spectacular phenomena. 'The images show a massive moulin, which is a glacial feature that is the result of flowing water carving its way down through weaker points in the ice,' Mearig said. Adventurous photographer, Kent Mearig, scaled the 50-foot crevasse on the Mendenhall Glacier to experience its frozen beauty . The glacier is only 10 miles from his home - in Juneau, Alaska - and Mearig has long been exploring the icy natural wonders . ''We visited the Mendenhall Glacier because it is unbearably easy to access its incredible features, like the one in the photos, only a couple of hours from our homes. 'There are times, especially when the sun is in the sky, that you just can't justify not going exploring on the ice... and this was one of those times. 'Sometimes the openings point straight down to the bedrock under the glacier, and other times, they turn and run horizontally for awhile. 'That was the case for this particular feature - it contained a passage that curved around a couple bends and was quite long.' With an ice axe in hand, guide Corey Denton explored the moulin, a feature resulting from water carving its way down through weaker points . Mearig especially enjoys exploring the glaciers when the sun is high in the sky and seeing the stunning reflections off of the ice . To assist him with his trek, Mearig enlisted the help of Corey Denton (left) and Dawn Riley (right), who are experienced glacier guides . Home to just 32,000 residents, Juneau was founded in 1881 by American miners who came to the land after Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867. Now, it's a modern city that must contend with nature, like in 2008, when an avalanche damaged the local power supply leaving the city without mains power or when last year's earthquake disrupted telecommunications. The city of Juneau is adjacent to the Juneau Icefield, so it is surrounded by a glacial landscape that includes islands, fjords, u-shaped valleys, sculpted mountains, and of course the glaciers themselves. While sometimes glacier openings point straight down to the bedrock underneath, other times, they turn and run horizontally (pictured here) Mearig admits that it's difficult to describe just how much he loves the Mendenhall Glacier, as it's been part of his life since he was 10 years old . Kent visited the most accessible local glacier with experienced local guides Corey Denton and Dawn Riley. 'Corey and Dawn are both glacier guides with extensive training and experience on the Mendenhall,' Mearig explained. 'But there's always a degree of danger inherent in glacier travel and climbing in general. 'It's difficult to describe how much I love the Mendenhall Glacier. 'Views of the glacier have been a part of my daily life since I was ten years old, and I've been enjoying its beauty up close for more than a decade. 'It is constantly changing as it retreats further and further up its valley, but it consistently takes my breath away.'","Kent Mearig, 33, from Juneau, Alaska, has long been a fan of the nearby Mendenhall Glacier .

"It hasn't moved in three years, but the symbolic Doomsday Clock's minute hand could be about edge closer to midnight. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) will host a live international news conference on Thursday to reveal its latest decision regarding the minute hand of the  clock. The last time the clock's minute hand was adjusted was in January 2012, when it pushed ahead one minute, from six to five minutes before midnight. Scroll down for full timeline . Tick tock: Here Kennette Benedict, executive director of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS), is shown unveiling the New Doomsday Clock during a news conference in 2007. The BAS has said it will host a live conference tomorrow to reveal the Science and Security Board's decision regarding the clock's minute hand . The conference will begin at 4pm GMT (11am EST) on 22 January 2015. It is expected that key topics to be discussed at the event will include evidence of accelerating climate change, terrorism and nuclear modernisation. The BAS was founded in 1945 by University of Chicago scientists who had helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The physicists set up the Doomsday Clock in 1947 after their atomic bombs hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. Their Clock was created to convey threats to humanity and the planet. Midnight represents Doomsday, or when these threats will peak and cause a global catastrophe.

Climate threats: It is not known whether tomorrow's announcement will specifically relate to the threat posed by nuclear weapons, or other trends, such as climate change. This graphic from last year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows observed examples of climate change worldwide . The decision to move the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock is made by the Bulletin's Board of Directors in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 18 Nobel Laureates. The Clock has become a universally recognised indicator of the world's vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons, climate change, and emerging technologies in  life sciences. Since it was set up, the hand on the clock has moved 18 times, and each move represents how the scientists view the world's chances of survival in the face of these threats. This graphic details key changes and movements of the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock since 1947 . 2012: FIVE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 2010:SIX MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 2007: FIVE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 2002: SEVEN MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1998: NINE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1995: 14 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1991: 17 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1990:  10 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1988: SIX MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1984: THREE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1981: FOUR MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1980: SEVEN MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1974: NINE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1972: 12 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1969: 10 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1968: SEVEN MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1963: 12 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1960: SEVEN MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1953: TWO MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1949: THREE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . 1947: SEVEN MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT . Source: Bulletin of Atomic Scientists . When the hand was moved to five minutes to midnight in 2012, the BAS said it believed the world had entered a 'second nuclear age'. The first nuclear age ended with the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty in 1991 by the US and Russia. However, according to the BAS, both countries have more than 26,000 nuclear weapons combined, that could be launched at a moment's notice. At the time, the BAS criticised nuclear watchdogs around the world for failing to take a stand on these weapons and national policies. Soaring global temperatures: Noaa's data revealed that 2014 was the hottest year since records began. This map is made up of provisional data from 2014 up to October. Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8°C (1.4°F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years . Terrorist threats: Recent  attacks in France, following the publication of a a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad in Charlie Hebdo (pictured), could feature among the reasons for moving the Clock's minute hand . Food shortages are expected to get worse . Last year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report claimed increases in crop yields have slowed over the last 40 years. Some studies now point to dramatic declines in some crops over the next 50 years - especially wheat and corn. Violent conflict may be triggered as a result . Climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees. Fights over resources, like water and energy, hunger and extreme weather will all go into the mix to destabilise the world. Gap between the rich and poor to widen . Poor people are going to bear an unfair burden of climate change, the report said. Climate change is going to exacerbate existing inequalities, and it is going to make it harder for people to fight their way out of poverty. It is not known whether tomorrow's announcement will specifically relate to the threat posed by nuclear weapons, or other trends. During 2014, for example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report said there was evidence of accelerating climate change, and criticised the world's efforts to curb greenhouse emissions. Global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880, according to US scientists. Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8°C (1.4°F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years. The Met Office had previously announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the UK in records dating back to 1910. Last year, President Barack Obama  revealed his country's 30-year plan to modernise its nuclear program. The modernisation is expected to cost almost $1 trillion, according to the Centre on Nuclear Security. Recent terrorist attacks in France, following the publication of an anti-Muslim cartoon in Charlie Hebdo, could also feature among the reasons for moving the minute hand. There is, however, also the possibility the Clock's hand could be moved back.","Symbolic clock was established by Manhattan Project scientists in 1947 .

"Waiting times for cancer treatment and other operations are at their highest for six years as the crisis in A&E has infected the rest of the health service. Experts warned that hospitals are now ‘stretched to the limit’ and said the situation is ‘critical’. Some 13 hospitals across England declared major incidents earlier this month as they were unable to cope with the numbers arriving in A&E. New figures show just 83.5 per cent of cancer patients were treated within 62 days of urgent referral from their GP, when the target is 85 per cent (file picture) They were forced to cancel other operations and had to create makeshift emergency wards out of areas normally used for day surgeries or kidney dialysis. Now a report by health think-tank The King’s Fund has found waiting times for tests and surgeries for non-emergency patients are at their worst level since December 2008. More than 39,400 people – some 12.5 per cent of patients – waited more than 18 weeks for hospital treatment in November, the latest figures show. And just 83.5 per cent of cancer patients were treated within 62 days of urgent referral from their GP, when the target is 85 per cent. This means that 5,500 patients waited longer – also the worst rate for six years. The King’s Fund said the financial squeeze and the pressure caused by overwhelmed A&E units are increasing waiting times even further. John Appleby, chief economist at the charity, said: ‘While recent attention has focused on the problems faced by A&E units, performance against waiting time targets and other indicators has continued to worsen. Some 13 hospitals across England declared major incidents earlier this month as they were unable to cope with the numbers arriving in A&E (file picture) ‘With financial problems also endemic among hospitals and staff morale a significant cause for concern, the situation is now critical.’ Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association’s council, said the A&E crisis is ‘directly linked to pressures across the NHS’. He said: ‘Every part of the system – from general practice, to hospitals, to community care – is struggling to keep up with demand, leaving some patients facing unacceptable delays.’ He added that some patients have operations cancelled even as they are about to be taken to theatre. Jamie Reed MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Minister said: ‘The A&E crisis is intensifying and spreading to other parts of the NHS. This is down to the Government’s failure to get a grip on it.' A Department of Health spokesman said the NHS is ‘busier than ever’ and that it has given almost £1billion this year to pay for more doctors, nurses, beds and treatments.","Waiting times for non-emergency tests and surgeries at worst since 2008 .

The former Staffordshire miner, who suffers from Parkinson's Disease, said he was now desperate to thank Nottinghamshire-born Westwood. He told the Birmingham Mail: 'If there is a power looking over us, I hope he takes note and delivers three Majors to this kind and gentle human being. 'I have Parkinson's disease so to enter the sea was foolhardy or stupid. 'As soon as I entered I realised I was in trouble. My legs wouldn't move, and my wife Laurae was out of earshot. 'The family next to us on the beach heard my cry and within a second a muscular male grabbed me and, with tremendous but gentle care, got me back to my lounge bed.'

"Another police killing is stirring anger in another town, this time in New Jersey, where a tense traffic stop captured on video ended with a passenger shot to death as he stepped out of a car with his hands raised at shoulder height. The newly released footage from a police dashboard camera shows Bridgeton officers Braheme Days and Roger Worley in a December 30 stop that escalates quickly after Days warns his partner about seeing a gun in the glove compartment of the Jaguar. Days screams over and over at the passenger, Jerame Reid, 'Show me your hands!' and 'If you reach for something, you're going to be f------ dead!' Scroll down for video . Hands up: Dashboard camera footage shows that passenger Jerame Reid had both of his hands up while police officers shot him to death . Fatally shot: Jerame C. Reid, 36,  was fatally shot by Bridgeton police officers Tuesday, December 30 and video footage reveals that he raised both his hands to surrender before being shot . The officer appears to reach into the car and remove the gun. But the brief standoff ends with Reid disregarding Days' order to not move, stepping out and getting shot. The shooting has touched off protests in Bridgeton, a struggling city of about 25,000 people — two-thirds of them black or Hispanic — 35 miles from Philadelphia. The case came after months of turbulent demonstrations and violence over the killings of unarmed black men by white police officers in New York and Ferguson, Missouri. Days is black, his partner white. The passenger was black, as was the driver. Both officers have been placed on leave while the Cumberland County prosecutor's office investigates. Hands up: Video show the men inside of the car with their hands out to surrender to police . On the ground: Following his friend being shot, the driver of the car got out of the vehicle and onto the ground so that the police could arrest him . Activists are calling on the prosecutor to transfer the case to the state attorney general. County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McCrae has disqualified herself from the case because she knows Days. First Assistant Prosecutor Harold Shapiro would not comment on the investigation Wednesday. 'The video speaks for itself that at no point was Jerame Reid a threat and he possessed no weapon on his person' said Walter Hudson, chair and founder of the civil rights group the National Awareness Alliance. 'He complied with the officer and the officer shot him.' Reid, 36, had spent about 13 years in prison for shooting at New Jersey State Police troopers when he was a teenager. He was also arrested last year on charges including drug possession and obstruction; Days was one of the arresting officers then. Officers: Video shows officers Braheme Days (left) and Roger Worley (right) shooting at a black man who appears to be surrendering with his hands up . The video was released through open records requests from the South Jersey Times and the Press of Atlantic City. The officers had pulled over the Jaguar for rolling through a stop sign, and the encounter starts friendly. But Days suddenly steps back, pulls his gun and tells the men, 'Show me your hands.' Days tells his partner there is a gun in the glove compartment and then appears to reach in and remove a handgun. The driver, Leroy Tutt, is seen showing his hands atop the open window on his side of the car. It's not clear what Reid is doing, though Days repeatedly warns him not to move during the standoff of less than two minutes. 'I'm going to shoot you!' Days shouts, referring to Reid at one point by his first name. 'You're going to be ... dead! If you reach for something, you're going to be ... dead!' 'I ain't got no reason to reach for nothing, bro. I ain't got no reason to reach for nothing,' Reid says as Days continues to yell to his partner that Reid is reaching for something. Someone then says,'I'm getting out and getting on the ground,' but Days yells at Reid not to move. The passenger door pops open and Reid emerges. His hands are at about shoulder height and appear to be empty. As he steps out, the officers fire at least six shots.

"Russian police have captured an on-the-run nanny who was recorded on a hidden camera beating an 11-month-old baby and throwing him around the room. Businessman Mark Tikhonov, 43, hired 53-year-old Larissa Ulyanova online and asked her to look after his son in Chelyabinsk, a city in central Russia's Chelyabinsk Oblast region. He said that when they were around she had seemed attentive and caring for the baby boy but he became suspicious because the child seemed distressed every time he was handed over to her. Scroll down for video . The nanny was captured on camera throwing the baby onto the couch (pictured) as she tried to dress him . Hidden camera footage also revealed the moment the nanny appeared to strike the baby boy (pictured left) In another scene caught on camera, she dangled him upside down as she puts on his clothes . Mr Tikhonov said: 'I didn't for a second think she was abusing him, and I even took two weeks off work to try and help the pair of them get to know each other better. 'When I was around she was always caring and attentive.' But after his son's distress continued he decided to install a hidden camera, which captured shocking images of the boy barely able to walk being picked up and flung onto the sofa, slapped on the face or having his legs knocked out from under him to force him to fall back down into his baby chair. After the footage was handed to police, they launched a search for the woman who has now been tracked down and arrested. A medical test of the baby has now been completed that showed he was suffering from damaged vertebrae, although it was not possible to confirm that this was at the hands of his nanny. Larissa Ulyanova, 53, was caught when police issued an arrest warrant after having seen the footage . However prosecutors have given the go-ahead now to charge the woman, who faces up to seven years in jail for the violent attack on the child. The slaps and the aggression were clearly designed to cause distress to the boy but at the same time not to leave marks that would make the parents suspicious. After seeing the footage of the abuse, the furious dad had confronted Ulyanova when she turned up for work and she fled the apartment and went on the run. The parents filed a complaint with police who confirmed they had tracked her down and later arrested her over child cruelty. Mr Tikhonov said: 'My little boy is now nervous and afraid and is going to need a lot of love and care to get over his ordeal.'","Russian police capture nanny who was recorded hitting 11-month-old baby .

"Isaac Nash, aged 12, from Highburton in West Yorkshire, who drowned after being swept out to sea during a family holiday off the coast of Anglesey . The grandfather of a boy of 12 who drowned after being swept out to sea on a family holiday broke down in tears yesterday as he described his desperate attempts to rescue his grandson. Paul Nash, 62, recalled the moment he lost his grip on Isaac Nash as they were forced on to jagged rocks by strong waves. The sporty schoolboy had been swimming with his brother Xander, ten, when they were dragged into a strong current near a river estuary off Anglesey in North Wales. Their father, Adam Nash, helped Xander to shore, but Isaac was swept away and his body was never found. Mr Nash Sr, a businessman, told an inquest: ‘I swam after the boys and when I got to them they were screaming and shouting. ‘I screamed at them “swim”. Isaac was seriously panicking, he was disappearing under the waves and shouting that he couldn’t breathe. ‘I got hold of him, two or three times, but a big wave bashed us against the rocks. I hurt my head. ‘I turned to try and find Isaac, I was fighting against the waves and I lost him at that point. I was being knocked on to the rocks and back into the water and was screaming “Isaac, Isaac”, but I couldn’t see him and got no response. I hauled myself out on to the rocks but I couldn’t see any sign of him. ‘The next thing I knew I was stuck out on a rock, clinging on with waves hitting me, that’s when help came.’ Isaac died last August 29 during a family camping trip, the inquest in Llangefni, Anglesey, heard. The day before, he had run up the 3,560ft Mount Snowdon with his father and brother. The Nashes were due to return home to High Burton, in West Yorkshire, that afternoon. As they walked along Aberffraw Beach, Mr Nash Jr, 35, a creative designer, shouted to his sons to stay in shallow water away from the estuary of the River Ffraw. But the court heard they were quickly swept out of their depth. Strong winds and a high spring tide created a fast current along rocks next to a deep underwater trench. Scroll down for video . Grandfather Paul Nash, left, with Isaac's parents, Adam and Zoe Nash, far right, and Michael RobertS, a dog walker who witnessed the tragedy, arrive at the inquest . Aberffraw beach, Anglesey  where Isaac went missing in August last year after being swept out to sea . Through tears, Mr Nash Jr said he took the decision to go after his younger son, who was being carried out to sea away from his brother. ‘I heard my son Isaac calling out, it was more of a shriek,’ he said. ‘They were being swept around the side by the rocks. I ran in, I didn’t have time to take my trousers off. ‘As I got towards Xander he was struggling to breathe, the waves were coming over his face. The waves were so frequent I couldn’t keep hold of him for long.’ Eventually, Mr Nash Jr helped Xander back to the beach where his wife Zoe and daughter Greta, two, were waiting. Xander was blue with cold and told his mother: ‘I didn’t think I would make it.’ Despite searches by lifeboats, an RAF helicopter and underwater teams, Isaac’s body was not found. Mr Nash today described his grandson as a 'mischievous and fun-loving' boy who 'pushed the limits' Mr Nash Sr, who had visited the beauty spot for 55 years, said he knew the estuary was dangerous and had warned the boys. But they were having fun in the waves and drifted too close. By the time the family realised they were in danger, it was too late. Mr Nash Sr added: ‘When I was a child, a boy from the village who was a strong swimmer died in the same place. I am fully aware it can be very dangerous.’ Coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones recorded a verdict of misadventure and said he would be writing to Anglesey Council to recommend permanent signs warning people not to swim near the estuary. Mrs Nash, 35, a teacher, said Isaac was a good swimmer who was ‘one step off competition swimming’.

"A man has died after jumping from a burning building in Brooklyn last night after flames blocked his only route of escaping the fire. Hundreds of firefighters tackled the blaze which ripped through a hardware store and a set of apartments in Prospect Heights. Police say the fire broke out just before 3.40am at the four-story building on Flatbush Avenue. Scroll down for video . The hardware store as well as the apartments above it were left gutted in the huge blaze . Firefighters attempt to evacuate residents of the upper floors of the apartment building . More than 160 firefighters were on scene to help extinguish the blaze (pictured) Emergency services work at the scene of the blaze in which seven people were injured and one died . Among those injured were two police officers who suffered smoke inhalation, a person left critically injured, two with serious burns and two others that suffered minor injuries, NBC New York reported. The street was closed as more than 160 firefighters from 39 units tackled the fire and helped evacuate residents, while 30 people were left displaced by the raging fire. The man who died when he leapt from the building owned a deli in the area and was on the floor above the hardware store when the fire broke out, it was reported. Struggling to reach the fire escape due to thick smoke and huge flames, he decided the best option was to jump, his sister-in-law said. 'He tried to get out from the fire escape, the flames were too big,' she told the New York Daily News. Christopher Nation, the owner of Flatbush Hardware, told the paper he woke up, looked out his window and saw his business on fire.

"An electronic gadget that alerts insurance firms of people's driving habits could be used by hackers to control the car, it has been claimed. Experts say the Snapshot, which Progressive Insurance has used  in more than two million vehicles since 2008, is simple to hack. By gaining access to it hackers could theoretically affect steering or braking, a security expert has claimed. The SnapShot (right) simply plugs into a car's diagnostic port - but contains virtually no security measures, a leading expert has claimed. A SnapShot user manages to work out how the gadget communicates with the car, and found that he was able to access certain functions of the car's CAN bus - a standard system which allows various computers and components inside a car to talk to each other. The SnapShot connects to the car via this system, and by gaining access to it hackers could theoretically affect steering or braking. Corey Thuen, who works as a security expert at consultancy firm Digital Bond, reverse engineered the software included on the SnapShot and found that he was able to access certain functions of the car's CAN bus - a standard system which allows various computers and components inside a car to talk to each other. The SnapShot connects to the car via this system, and by gaining access to it hackers could theoretically affect steering or braking. 'The firmware running on the dongle is minimal and insecure,' he told Forbes. 'It does no validation or signing of firmware updates, no secure boot, no cellular authentication, no secure communications or encryption, no data execution prevention or attack mitigation technologies… basically it uses no security technologies whatsoever.' Thuen said the results could be disastrous. 'A skilled attacker could almost certainly compromise such dongles to gain remote control of a vehicle, or even an entire fleet of vehicles. 'Once compromised, the consequences range from privacy data loss to life and limb. Progressive hit out at the claims, and the way they were revealed - the flaw was presented last week at the S4x15 hacking conference in Miami. 'If an individual has credible evidence of a potential vulnerability related to our device, we would prefer that the person would first disclose that potential vulnerability to use so that we could evaluate it and, if necessary, correct it before the vulnerability could be exploited,' the company told Forbes. The gadget is plugged into the car's diagnostic port - and sends information to insurance firms. 'While it's unfortunate that Mr. Thuen didn't share his findings with us privately in advance, we would welcome his confidential and detailed input so that we can properly evaluate his claims.' Thuen reportedly contacted the manufacturer of the SnapShot device, Xirgo Technologies, to inform it of the security vulnerability, but heard no response. Progressive Insurance says on its website that Snapshot 'notes information like the distance, time of day and how you drive, including any hard brakes. 'Snapshot personalises your insurance rate based on your actual driving. 'The better you drive, the more you can save.' David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, warned 'This is just another example of how, as our cars become increasingly connected, we open the door to threats that have long existed in the PC and smartphone world. 'As well as gaining remote access to the vehicle, by compromising USB dongles cybercriminals could potentially exploit features such as self-parking, active lane control, pre-collision systems and adaptive cruise control, all of which require some level of communication between a sensor and the brakes, acceleration or steering, usually over Bluetooth or some other radio signal. 'As vehicles become increasingly connected and autonomous, we can only expect to see more attacks of this nature.'","Snapshot used by Progressive  in more than two million vehicles .

"An American TV presenter who turned up at an English country house to film wearing a dress and high heels was forced to change into a tweed outfit by the owner who took exception to her appearance. CNBC presenter Susan Li visited North Cadbury Court in Wincanton, Somerset to film a travel piece about the 1,500-acre estate's Downton Abbey-style holidays. But after showing up to begin filming wearing a fitted white dress and heels, Miss Li was asked to change after the owner Archie Montgomery called her outfit 'more appropriate to Kensington and Chelsea' than a traditional English estate. Scroll down for video . CNBC host Susan Li visited North Cadbury Court in Wincanton, Somerset to film a travel piece and was shown around the estate by owner Archie Montgomery . However, Mr Montgomery took exception to Miss Li's outfit of a white dress and heels, left, and forced her to change into a tweed outfit, complete with a flat cap and Wellington boots, right . Staff at the estate were then forced to hastily gather a selection of clothes for Miss Li, which included a thick cashmere jumper, a gilet, Wellington boots and a flat cap. Mr Montgomery said: 'Susan arrived, looking gorgeous, wearing a white jersey dress and heels that were more appropriate to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. 'She was beautifully made up. We rather thought this may be the case. 'I said ""Really, we need to dress you a bit more appropriately"". 'We got a selection of clothes laid out. The amazing thing was that we managed to have everything fit her, down to the smart Wellington boots. 'She was very relaxed. She looked terrific in the tweed, so I think she was very happy.' Miss Li, one of the best-known faces on American TV and the co-anchor of CNBC's flagship show Squawk Box visited North Cadbury Court as part of the channel's luxury travel show First Class . Miss Li is one of the best-known faces on American TV and co-anchors CNBC’s flagship morning programme Squawk Box. She jetted into the UK to film a piece on North Cadbury Court for the channel’s luxury US travel show First Class. Downton Abbey is a huge hit in America - drawing 10 million viewers - and has sparked a boom in US tourists seeking the authentic English country experience. After her wardrobe change, she indulged in the many traditional activities available on the estate, including clay pigeon shooting and golf. Mr Montgomery said: 'She hit a clay with her second shot, which we all thought was rather stunning. High fives all round. She was very game-on. She was up for anything.' And in a bid to avoid similar sartorial faux pas by future guests, he offered a tips for dressing appropriately in a country pile. While at the country estate Miss Li took part in some quintessentially British country activities including clay pigeon shooting, pictured . Miss Li takes aim during clay pigeon shooting. Mr Montgomery has suggested people visiting his manor should dress appropriately for the weather . He explained: 'In a British country house I would think mostly wear something warm, as some country houses aren’t as warm as ours. 'I think the whole Downton-esq dressing for the occasion will appeal to the Americans. 'Particularly if you’re engaging in field sports, I think it is not only sensible because the clothing is generally geared for the weather, but I think it is all part of the charm and the respect for the occasion to dress appropriately. 'And if it is a matter of wearing one’s estate tweed, I think that is all part of the occasion - in much the same way people dress up in black tie to go out to dinner.' North Cadbury Court has been described as a modern Downton Abbey and boasts a cellar casino and disco, a heated swimming pool, sauna and pistol range. Miss Li also hit golf balls from the roof of North Cadbury Court as part of filming for the CNBC travel show . Miss Li also enjoyed a horse ride through the 1,500 acre estate as part of her visit . It also has a ballroom that can seat 150 as well as a dining room to feed 96 guests. Mr Montgomery added: 'The house will appeal to Americans looking for a Downton Abbey experience because it is a genuine old English estate. 'But we have got to bring Downton into the modern age a bit. This is Downton Abey with a modern touch. 'In the casino, we have exactly the same lamps that you’ll see in Downton Abbey. And it is all beautiful wall paper in the cellar. 'Lord Grantham would look absolutely the part in his smoking jacket in our poker room. In fact, I might ask him if he wants to come and play.' Miss Li’s feature on the estate will be broadcast on CNBC in March as part of a travel guide to the UK for Americans.","CNBC host Susan Li turned up to film at North Cadbury Court in Somerset .

"Politicians do it, barristers do it, even comedians do it – but for others, being able to speak fluently on a subject can leave them flustered and tongue-tied. Now scientists are trying to find out just what it is that allows some of us to speak without hesitation, deviation or repetition. The study – which is modelled on the long-running Radio 4 series Just a Minute, in which contestants ad lib for 60 seconds – is comparing the brains of comics, barristers and TV personalities with those of ‘normal’ people. The study was modelled on the Radio 4 series Just a Minute, hosted by Nicholas Parsons (left). Comedian Richard Herring (right) was put through his paces by the scientists . Differences in the scans could reveal why some people are silver-tongued in situations that leave others mumbling. Researcher Joe Nercus, of University College London, said: ‘We assume we are all experts in speech but some just seem more natural and fluent than others. 'How come some are born raconteurs while others struggle?’ During the experiment, volunteers must speak as fluently as they can on ten topics while lying in an MRI scanner. Unlike on Just a Minute, they only have 30 seconds to fill – as a minute was deemed too tricky – but they do have to lie perfectly still and put up with the noise of the machine. A second activity – counting out loud – shows how the brain reacts during a task that does not involve improvisation. While this may seem simple, some of the comedians actually found it harder than talking about a topic. The study might show that those with the gift of the gab use the same part of the brain as everyone else, but just put it to better use. Or there may be structural differences in the brain. Two Just a Minute contestants, comedians Richard Herring and Robin Ince, were put through their paces by the scientists. Describing what it was like to have his brain scanned for ‘jolly but still deeply scientific reasons’, Mr Herring said: ‘I was secretly hoping they would discover that my grey matter was special in some way or had some additional little bend or section which enabled me to be so very funny. ‘I don’t want to say that I am the next step in human evolution, that is for science to decide.’ Writing on his blog, he also describes how while he struggled with the counting test, some of the non-professional speakers struggled when asked to talk non-stop on a surprise topic. Mr Herring said: ‘It’s amazing what things can seem simple to one people are so difficult to another.’ Several other unnamed comedians have also signed up. However, the UCL team is particularly keen to see inside the head of Paul Merton, who regularly outshines the other panel members on the Radio 4 show. The researchers hope unlocking the secret of eloquence could help in the treatment of speech problems and Alzheimer’s.","The study was modelled on the long-running Radio 4 series Just a Minute .

"A mother-of-one who became so overweight that she got wedged in a park swing has lost a staggering 14 stone in just under two years. Louise Lister,  weighed 27 stone and was wearing a size 36 this time 18 months ago, but after finding herself in the embarrassing predicament while taking her daughter to the park she vowed to change her ways. The 41-year-old, from Workington, Cumbria, said that she knew something had to be done when just getting around became a daily struggle. At 27st (left) Louise Lister found it difficult to get about but after getting stuck in a park swing the mother-of-one joined Slimming World and dropped 14st in just under two years . 'Being the weight I was I always worried about breaking things and when I sat on the swing I could feel I was stuck - the chains were painfully digging into my sides and I was panicking that it would break. 'It was so embarrassing. I knew I had to do something about my weight. I didn't like being in pain from all the weight I was carrying around - I used to suffer terribly with my joints and back. 'The simplest of tasks made me out of breath and I wanted to be an active mum for my daughter Megan.' Louise says that the simplest tasks would become a struggle and prevented her from becoming an active mother to her daughter Megan . At a size 36 Louise would often struggle to find clothes that fit and had to settle with whatever she could find . Louise is now a svelte size 12-14 and is even hoping to inspire others as a Slimming World consultant . Louise embarked on a radical diet overhaul, swapping her usual fish and chip dinner for home cooked Slimming World meals such as chilli con carne and chicken salads. Louise says that she began to notice a difference almost immediately making her determined to continue with her weight loss. 'As soon as the weight started coming off I immediately felt better. I had so much more energy and was determined to keep going with it.' Louise managed to shed just under half her body weight, dropping 14st and is now a svelte size 12-14 frame. Louise and her husband Peter (pictured) used to live off a diet of greasy takeaways . The pair have since swapped their high calorie dinners for home cooked meals and Peter has lost 10st too . The mother-of-one says that she enjoys shopping for outfits that show off her new figure. 'I am so pleased to finally be able to wear the clothes I want to- not just clothes from specialist plus sized shops. 'It was so hard for me to find anything that fitted at a size 36. 'I brushed it off and tried to pretend that my weight wasn't an issue but looking back now I am so glad I decided to lose the weight and become the healthy active mum my daughter deserves.' Louise has continued her healthy lifestyle and now works out five days a week and loves Kettlercise and circuits. BREAKFAST: Nothing . LUNCH: Crisps, chocolate, pie and chips . DINNER: Takeaway - fish and chips, Mc Donald's or Chinese . BREAKFAST: Porridge, weetabix, yoghurt and fruit . LUNCH: Chicken salad, jacket potato or salad . DINNER: Chilli or steak and diet chips . The mother-of-one now uses her story to help inspire other women in her job as a Slimming World consultant. 'I love exercise now and I can't believe how much fun I find working out. A year ago I couldn't get off the sofa without getting out of breath but now I'm doing circuits. 'I want everyone who wants to lose weight to realise how much Slimming World can change your life. It is such a healthy and effective way of losing weight.' Louise has even manage to help her partner achieve a dramatic weight loss with her new approach to cooking. 'My husband has even lost 10st as well, just by eating my healthy home cooked meals. It's been fantastic.'","Louise Lister, 41 weighed 27st and was a size 36 .

"A beloved surgeon who was targeted and fatally shot by gunman at a Boston hospital on Tuesday was expecting his fourth child with his wife, who is seven months pregnant, it has emerged. Cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Michael Davidson, 44, from Wellesley, Massachusetts, was shot by Stephen Pasceri, 55, on Tuesday morning and passed away late that evening. Pasceri's relatives suggested that he was angry over the death of his mother, whom Dr Davidson had treated. Davidson leaves behind his wife, who is a plastic surgeon, and their three other children, two girls aged seven and nine and a two-year-old son, his father-in-law told the Boston Herald. Four of Davidson's colleagues paid tribute to him during a news conference at the hospital, and remembered him as 'almost always the smartest man in the room'. Scroll down for video . Vendetta? Accountant Stephen Pasceri (left) opened fire on Dr. Michael Davidson (right) at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday. The doctor died  and Pasceri took his own life after the shooting . 'You all should be absolutely assured that Michael Davidson was one of the kindest, best possible men that ever walked on this earth,' colleague Dr. Andrew Eisenhauer said, ABC News reported. 'We knew that and his patients knew that and his family knows that.' His colleagues also recalled his 'silly side' and how he played guitar in a band with other doctors from the hospital. The gunman, an accountant and married father-of-four, had walked into the heart center and asked for Dr Davidson, before shooting him twice and taking his own life in a separate room. On Wednesday, Dr Davidson's heartbroken father-in-law told the Herald how Dr Davidson had yelled for patients and staff to flee before he was shot. 'He was a hero - he told everybody to get out,' he said. 'He started yelling, ""Get out. Get out."" He knew it was coming.' He recalled how much he cared for his patients, and added: 'He loved his family. He loved his kids. He loved my daughter to death.' A fund has been set up for the family here. Left behind: Davidson and his wife Terri, pictured, have two daughters, seven and nine, and a son, two . Mourning: Brigham and Women's Hospital doctors, from the left, Charles Morris, Andrew Eisenhauer,  Daniel Wiener and Pinak Shah appear emotional as they face members of the media to speak about Davidson . Pasceri's family have said they can't understand why he snapped, but they believe he could have been wanting to enact revenge on Dr. Davidson after his mother, Marguerite, died in November. Dr. Davidson had treated Marguerite Pasceri for a cardiovascular condition during her stay at Brigham and Women's last year. She died on November 15, 2014. Pasceri, who was licensed to carry a firearm, may have also been holding a vendetta because of the health care his father Greg received during a fatal hear attack in December 2011. The Worcester Telegram reported that in 2012, Pasceri became so furious that his mother had been left with a $8,000 medical bill, he wrote to Senator John Kerry and US Rep. James McGovern to demand an investigation. However, the newspaper noted that the Pasceri family had no issue with the level of care received by their father at Massachusetts General Hospital. Pasceri's sister said she was stunned that her brother had attacked the doctor. Blame game: Marguerite E. (Olofson) Pasceri passed away on November 15, 2014 and it is thought that her son and executor, Stephen Pasceri blamed Dr. Davidson at Brigham and Women's Hospital for her passing . somber: A memorial and lowering of the the flag took place near the hospital on Wednesday for the doctor . Heartbroken: Administrators and staff at a leading Boston hospital are mourning the death of a cardiac surgeon who was fatally shot at the hospital by a man who then killed himself . Sadness: The hospital's logo flag was lowered to half-staff during a Wednesday ceremony to honor Davidson . Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death. 'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement early Wednesday . 'Everything seemed to be going really well. I have no idea why he snapped like this,' said Marguerite Jolym, according to the Boston Herald. According to Joly, her brother 'deeply loved' his mother and said her 'warm, compassionate, generous and understanding personality was a gift and example to the world'. 'I think it comes down to the fact that my brother thought it was the doctor's fault that my mother died,' Joly said. 'I don't know why my brother would blame him. I really don't know why.' According to the Boston Herald, Pasceri worked as an accountant for Waters Corp, which is based in Milford. Marguerite Joly said her brother served in the military for a time and was honorably discharged and was a married father of four. 'We can't even wrap our brains around this,' she said. 'There was no indication whatsoever that he would ever do anything like this... All his ducks were in a row,' she said. 'This was not a bad, evil man. Something happened, and I don't know what.' Response: Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief William Gross, (center left), walks through a revolving door as he departs the Shapiro building at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday after the shooting . Security: The hospital has a well-drilled evacuation procedure for an active shooter situation and put that plan into action on Tuesday . Evacuation: Medical personnel walk past law enforcement officials, (right), as they depart the Shapiro building after the cardiologist was shot . In the aftermath of Dr. Davidson's death, staff at Brigham and women's entered into a period of mourning according to NECN. Hospital officials said Wednesday they planned to lower a flag outside the hospital to half-staff in honor of Davidson. 'Dr. Davidson was a wonderful and inspiring cardiac surgeon who devoted his career to saving lives and improving the quality of life of every patient he cared for,' said a statement issued by the hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. 'It is truly devastating that his own life was taken in this horrible manner.' Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death. 'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement early Wednesday. Evans said earlier Tuesday that police were talking to witnesses, 'but it's leading us to believe there was something in the past that upset this guy, that made him go in and look for this particular doctor'. Global reputation: Brigham and Women's in Boston is world renowned for its emergency surgeries and facial reconstructions . Multiple agencies: The FBI, Boston Police Department and the ATF all arrived at the hospital after the incident on Tuesday morning . Checks: A man in medical scrubs ducks under crime scene tape as he leaves the building at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday morning . After shooting the surgeon, he went into another room and shot himself. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said officers conducting a room-by-room search found the gunman dead in an exam room with the weapon. Police said Pasceri wasn't a patient of the doctor's and they didn't specify a motive for the shootings. Shortly after the shooting, one witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene. 'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB. Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building. In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event. Crime scene: Boston Police officers, including Commissioner William Evans (C), work inside the building where a shooting occurred at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, Massachusetts . 'I am extremely proud of the way our staff responded,' said hospital president Dr. Elizabeth Nabel according to the Boston Globe. Boston police had at one stage mistakenly tweeted that Pasceri had been apprehended and was in custody. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said that because the doctor was surrounded by colleagues medical help was administered immediately. 'We are looking at a possible motive. We know (the gunman) came into the hospital on the second floor looking for this particular doctor. There was a reason he targeted this doctor,' Evans said according to WMUR.Com. 'Our prayers go out to the doctor's wife,' Evans said.","Dr. Michael Davidson was shot twice by Stephen Pasceri at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston on Tuesday and later died from his injuries .

"This is the poignant moment when a man rescued from the hell he endured at the hands of the Nazis met his saviour and gave him a salute almost 70 years later. Joshua Kaufman first saluted his rescuer Daniel Gillespie. Then he kissed his hand and finally, he fell to his feet, exclaiming: 'I have wanted to do this for 70 years. I love you, I love you so much...'. Kaufman, now 87, was a 'walking corpse' on April 29 1945 when U.S. Army soldier Gillespie, 89, marched in with his comrades to liberate the charnel house that was the Dachau concentration camp near Munich. Gillespie, a machine gunner with the 42nd 'Rainbow Division,' moved to block 11 of the infamous complex which was the first camp built by the Nazis to house its enemies in 1933. Scroll down for video . Salute: Nazi prisoner Joshua Kaufman (left) pays tribute to Daniel Gillespie (right), the American soldier who liberated him from the Dachau death camp . 'I love you so much': It was an emotional reunion for both men. Kaufman kissed the hand of his rescuer and said: 'I have wanted to do this for 70 years. I love you, I love you so much' Thank you: A clearly overwhelmed Kaufman fell at Gillespie's feet in gratitude when the two men were reunited in California for a television documentary . By the time it was liberated more than 35,000 people had been murdered there - in executions, in cruel medical experiments, starved, worked and beaten to death. The first person he saw was Hungarian Jew Kaufman. He was hiding in the latrines with other prisoners, uncertain if the soldiers who arrived were liberators or a Nazi death squad sent to liquidate the camp. 'We were confined to barracks by the guards. This meant most of us were marked for death,' Mr Kaufman said. 'Then I saw the white flag flying from the watchtower and I realised then that the torture was at an end. When the Americans smashed in the door, my heart did somersaults.' Gillespie helped the emaciated prisoner into the daylight and back into the land of the living. Both parted with tears in their eyes - both believed they would never see one another again. Then and now: A youthful Joshua Kaufman is pictured (left) before he was condemned to Dachau concentration camp, and (right) as he is at the age of 87 today . Hero: American soldier Daniel Gillespie pictured (left) as a soldier and (right) as he is at the age of 87 today . My hero: Kaufman thanks Gillespie for saving his life.  Recalling the moment he realised the camp had been liberated, Kaufman said:  'When the Americans smashed in the door, my heart did somersaults' Dachau, near Munich in Germany, was the first concentration camp set up by the Nazis in 1933. It was opened by Heinrich Himmler, one of Hitler's most trusted commanders. More than 35,000 prisoners died there before it was liberated by US forces on April 29, 1945. After liberation, the camp was used by the US Army as an internment camp. It was also the site of the Dachau Trials, for German war criminals, between November 1945 and August 1948. In 2013, Angela Merkel made history when she became the first German chancellor to visit the former concentration camp, where she expressed ""shame"" at the crimes of the Nazi regime. The infamous wrought iron sign reading 'Arbeit Mach Frei' - which means 'Work makes you free' was stolen from the camp's gates in November 2014. Kaufman, who lost most of his family in the Holocaust, made it to Israel where he became a soldier who fought in the Six Day War and the Yom Kippur War. He later emigrated to America where he married, fathered three daughters and became a self employed plumber. Gillespie married, fathered eight children and built a career for himself as a successful salesman. Amazingly, neither knew that they lived within an hour's drive of each other until a German documentary crew arranged their moving reunion on the sand at Hungtington Beach, California. Accompanied by his youngest daughter Alexandra, 34, to the meeting, Joshua said: 'I came out of hell into the light. For that, and to him, I am eternally grateful.' Gillespie, who had fought with his comrades through Europe to reach the gates of the Dachau camp, said: 'It was the most profound shock of my life. Its liberation changed my life forever. 'We could not understand it. I grew up in California where we had everything in abundance. 'We didn't get how people could let other people starve. They murdered them or just let them die. Again and again the questions moved through my head. And at the same time I was just incredibly angry.' Gates to hell: The entrance to the Dachau concentration camp, where more than 35,000 people are believed to have died, bearing the infamous Nazi slogan 'Arbeit Mach Frei' which meands 'Work makes you free' Torment: Pain is etched on the faces of prisoners inside Dachau in a picture believed to have been taken on the day the camp was liberated by American forces . When they were reunited, Gillespie asked Kaufman: 'How did you survive? What kept you alive?' An emotional and overwhelmed Kaufman replied: 'Dying would have been easier. In Dachau we had to tote around 50 kilo cement sacks. The whole day long. 'Whoever broke down was immediately shot. I turned me into an animal. And animals want to survive. I wanted to live.' He described how, to this day, he still sleeps on a thin mattress close to a window so he can gaze out at green grass every day. The meeting, and their stories, will be told in a special for the History Channel Deutschland to be screened on May 31. Kaufman had the last word on the beach when he said: 'I have everything I wanted in life through him. That is the reason for my thankfulness.' Both men are old, both realise they will probably never see one another again. But both said they were humbled by their meeting so many years after Nazism was crushed.

And although dad Tim managed to trap the beast, it ripped off its own leg to escape, sparking a tense hunt as the couple and their two sons, aged seven and eight, fled the house. They were so terrified they couldn’t even spend the night in their own home once the spider had been captured. Tim, who declined to give his surname, said: ‘Although people might think these things are funny, I keep thinking that the spider could have killed me or my son if he had gone to get a banana.’ The Brazilian wandering spider has caused 14 reported deaths, and although an antidote to its powerful neurotoxin has been developed, one pest control expert claimed there was no anti-venom in the UK. Guy’s Hospital in London held stocks, but they expired in 2011. Tim had been cooking breakfast when the supermarket van dropped off their order last weekend. Just as he was unpacking the bananas, he spotted the spider, and, in shock, dropped the bunch into a fruit bowl, trapping the beast by one of its legs. Tim said he had been cooking breakfast when the Waitrose van dropped his shopping off. When the spider was removed they discovered a sac of eggs containing thousands of babies . He took photographs and went online to identify it – discovering it was of a species the Guinness Book of Records calls the world’s most venomous. Tim said: ‘We were terrified. We got ourselves and our kids out of the house straight away.’ He and his wife Lisa called both the supermarket and the RSPCA, which said it was unable to handle such a dangerous animal and advised them to call 999. But police said they, too, could not deal with the spider – whose Greek scientific name translates as ‘murderess’ and whose venom can kill in two hours – and suggested a pest control expert. Waitrose sent a pest expert down to tackle the spider, which he described as 'hardcore' - the creature was eventually locked inside three separate boxes . Meanwhile, a Waitrose worker arrived, armed with just a freezer bag to trap the lethal spider. They went into the kitchen and discovered the creature had disappeared, leaving only its trapped leg behind. Tim said: ‘We had no idea where it had gone.’ And when the Waitrose worker lifted up the bananas, they spotted a sac containing hundreds of spider eggs. It was then that they decided to evacuate the house. Waitrose sent pest expert Steve Trippett to track down the spider he described as ‘hardcore’. He disposed of the eggs – putting them in a freezer to kill them – and, armed with a 3ft stick found the creature at the bottom of the fruit bowl. Rather than scuttling away, the spider became aggressive, standing on its back legs and showing its fangs. Undeterred, Mr Trippett used his stick to manoeuvre it into a heavy plastic box, which was then placed inside two other boxes. It is understood the spider was then taken to a scientific centre abroad. Tim said his family were ‘too traumatised to remain in the house’ so spent the night with friends. Waitrose said: ‘The safety of our customers is our absolute priority. ‘We did everything we could to look after our customer during what was a distressing incident and we’ve apologised personally. Although this is highly unusual, we’re taking it very seriously and will be working with our supplier to minimise the risk of this happening again.’ The supermarket offered the family £150 of shopping vouchers and a family day out in compensation. This is the latest of several incidents of the species finding its way to Britain – which experts say could be down to the trend for organic fruits not treated with chemicals that could kill the spiders. Last month a woman in Essex found eggs in bananas she bought from Tesco. She had to incinerate her vacuum cleaner after using it to clean them up. In March, a family evacuated their Staffordshire home after finding hundreds of hatchlings. Last November, a Tesco store in Kent had to close for several hours after a Brazilian wandering spider was found under a box of bananas. In the same month, a family had their London house fumigated after they bought infested bananas from Sainsbury’s.","Brazilian wandering spider, world's most deadly arachnid, found in bunch of bananas by parents Tim and Lisa .

"Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said SNP MPs elected in May would back Labour’s bid to repeal the Government’s NHS reforms . Scottish National Party MPs will vote on laws which only apply in England, Nicola Sturgeon has revealed. Scotland’s First Minister said SNP MPs elected in May would back Labour’s bid to repeal the Government’s NHS reforms, even though Holyrood is in complete control of the health service north of the border. The revelation, which sparked fury among Tory MPs in Westminster, comes after George Osborne revealed that the Government would bail out Scotland’s ailing oil industry following demands for Westminster support in the wake of collapsing global prices. It will fuel further calls for a ban on Scottish MPs voting on English-only laws. Tory minister Anna Soubry said Miss Sturgeon was putting the Union at risk again. 'I'm absolutely astonished at the complete twaddle she has just spoken,' she told the BBC. 'She doesn't even understand what's happened and this nonsense - and it is a nonsense - that the Conservatives are on some wide-scale privatisation of the NHS. She puts our Union at risk again and plays with dangerous stuff.' Tory MP John Redwood said the SNP was changing its position on English votes for English laws so it could enter into an agreement with Labour after the election. He said: 'This is a piece of political opportunism by the SNP because she wants to reassure the Labour party that if they fall short, if she wins a lot of seats, they might be able to stitch up a deal together. 'Obviously I want the Conservatives to win and hope this doesn’t arise but I think you have to see it in terms of positioning with the SNP riding a lot higher in the polls getting the idea that they might get their hands on the levers of power for the United Kingdom as a whole.' But Ms Sturgeon insisted any vote on the English NHS had knock-on effects in Scotland because the Edinburgh government’s budget is linked to Westminster spending. She said it was necessary to protect the Scottish NHS from the knock on effects of cuts and privatisation in England. The SNP leader told the BBC: ‘We would be prepared to vote on matters of English health because that has a direct impact on Scotland's budget. ‘So if there was a vote in the House of Commons to repeal the privatisation of the health service as has been seen in England to restore the National Health Service we would vote for that because that would help to protect Scotland's budget. ‘If there are decisions taken to further privatise the NHS in England, and I don't think anybody thinks the Tories are progressively privatising the health service in order to increase the public funding of the health service, so decisions are taken, that reduce over time the public funding of the health service in England then that has a direct knock on effect to Scotland's budget.’ Meanwhile, an Ipsos Mori poll for STV News has found 52 per cent of Scots are planning to vote SNP in May. This is the same as in October last year, while support for Labour has increased by one point to 24 per cent. That would give the Nationalists an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out. Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy insisted his party 'is changing' and urged voters to leave referendum divisions in the past. George Osborne has said an English-votes-for-English-laws rule would ‘have to apply on areas connected with the Budget’ Despite Ms Sturgeon’s claim, spending on the English NHS has gone up faster than the Scottish NHS in recent years. Between 2009-10 and 2015-16 NHS Scotland cut spending by around 1 per cent - while the health budget in England increased by 4 per cent. The revelation comes ahead of draft legislation on the devolution of extra powers to Holyrood set to be published on Thursday. Appearing before MPs earlier this week, George Osborne said the sweeping new spending powers reinforced the case for restrictions on the voting powers of Scottish MPs. He said an English-votes-for-English-laws rule would ‘have to apply on areas connected with the Budget’. In a message aimed at Ed Balls, who could find himself in No 11 Downing Street after the election as part of a Labour government relying on the support of smaller parties such as the SNP, Mr Osborne also said the chancellor after the next election should not be ‘beholden on Scottish nationalist votes’. David Cameron, at Prime Minister's Questions, has vowed to introduce English votes for English laws . Labour leader Ed Miliband has rejected Mr Cameron's proposal to ban Scottish MPs voting on English-only laws . Once powers to set income tax have been devolved, Scotland would have to ‘live with the consequences’ of its decisions - including if wealthy individuals flee across the border to escape ‘punitive’ rates, Mr Osborne told the Treasury Select Committee. Mr Osborne said proposals for ‘English votes for English laws’ would be published before the general election, but he insisted that it must be the case that Scottish MPs should have their ability to vote on aspects of future Budgets curbed if powers have been devolved. The cross-party Smith Commission on devolution said the Scottish MPs should continue to vote on the UK's Budget, including income tax. Many aspects of the system would remain UK-wide, Mr Osborne said, including the definition of income and the system of reliefs, so MPs from Scottish constituencies would be able to vote on those. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has revealed that an independent Scotland could have been up to £7billion worse off as a result of falling oil revenue. Mr Osborne lambasted predictions made by the SNP during the referendum campaign about the finances North Sea oil would generate for the nation as ‘wildly optimistic’. He told the Commons Treasury select committee: ‘I took decisions in the Autumn Statement to reduce taxes on North Sea oil, anticipating the pressures that the falling oil price would have on the industry and I'm sure we are going to have to take further steps at the Budget. ‘But we can only do that because we are United Kingdom and we pool our risks.’ The collapse in the price of oil would mean an independent Scotland would now be sacking doctors, nurses and teachers, Danny Alexander claimed. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said Scots had 'dodged a bullet' by rejecting independence in last year's referendum. The Scottish government is now demanding tax cuts to bailout the oil industry, just four months after claiming that booming North Sea reserves would bankroll independence. The oil industry has been plunged into crisis after the price of a barrel of Brent crude halved since June to around $48 . The price of a barrel of Brent crude – the global benchmark – has more than halved since June to around $48 (£31.50). Experts predict it could fall as low as $31 (£20.44) by April. Mr Alexander said: 'Talk about Scotland having dodged a bullet. If we had been independent we wouldn't just be worrying about a very serious situation in the North Sea, the Scottish government would be working out how many nurses and doctors and teachers it would have to make redundant because it would have run out of money for a lot of those things. 'If we were independent right now the effect on Scotland's finances would be utterly catastrophic. Last summer Westminster parties were accused of scaremongering by the SNP for warning an independent Scotland would be vulnerable to a drop in oil prices. 'As it turns out the things that we said were rather mild compared to what actually happened. 'There's still a lot of oil and gas there, we want to make sure we get it out. That's what I've always wanted. 'But it's only because of the strength and stability of the United Kingdom that we have the ability to make those decisions rather than an independent Scotland which wouldn't just be beset by serious problems in the North Sea but by a fiscal crisis as well. 'Because we are part of the United Kingdom we don't have to confront that.' He warned the situation facing the oil and gas sector is 'serious' and further help will be offered in the Budget in March.'","SNP MPs will vote on laws which only affect England, Nicola Sturgeon said .

"Asteroids contain hidden messages in their magnetic fields that could provide clues about the death of our planet. This is according to British scientists who have, for the first time, captured the dying moments a meteorite's magnetic field - a fate that could be shared with Earth. They unravelled the message by looking at tiny 'space magnets' in meteorites which retain a memory of the birth and death of the asteroid's core. British scientists have, for the first time, captured the dying moments a meteorite's magnetic field. The magnetic message contained within could provide clues to Earth's fate billions of years from now. The particular meteorites used for this study are known as pallasites (pictured), mostly made of iron and nickel . The readings, they say, provide a tantalising glimpse into how Earth's magnetic core will behave as it continues to freeze. This is of concern to scientists because the core affects the Earth's magnetic field, which has weakened by 15 per cent over the last 200 years. With a weakened magnetic field, the planet could be exposed to solar winds capable of punching holes into the ozone layer. The impact could be devastating for mankind, knocking out power grids, radically changing Earth's climate and eventually leading to the planet's demise. The magnetic field has weakened by 15 per cent over the last 200 years. With a weakened field, the planet could be exposed to solar winds capable of punching holes in the ozone layer (artist's impression pictured) Using a huge X-ray microscope, dubbed a synchrotron, scientists at Cambridge University decoded the message in meteorites. The Earth's core affects the planets magnetic field. As it freezes, the magnetic field weakens. The process has already begun. Recent research have found that the magnetic field has weakened by 15 per cent over the last 200 years. With a weakened magnetic field, the planet could be exposed to solar winds capable of punching holes into the ozone layer. The impact could be devastating for mankind, knocking out power grids, radically changing Earth's climate and eventually leading to the planet's demise. 'This is serious business', Richard Holme, Professor of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences at Liverpool University told MailOnline. 'Imagine for a moment your electrical power supply was knocked out for a few months – very little works without electricity these days.' The Earth's climate would change drastically. In fact, a recent Danish study believes global warming is directly related to the magnetic field rather than CO2 emissions. Radiation at ground level would also increase, with some estimates suggesting overall exposure to cosmic radiation would double causing more deaths from cancer. If the magnetic field continues to decline, over billions of years, Earth could end up like Mars - a once oceanic world that has become a dry, barren planet incapable of supporting life. 'Observing magnetic fields is one of the few ways we can peek inside a planet,' said Dr Richard Harrison of Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences, who led the research. Many asteroids had liquid outer cores, like Earth's, that gave them their own magnetic fields. Just as Earth will in a billion years, the asteroids then cooled down until their cores were solid, a process which killed their magnetic fields. 'It's long been assumed that metal-rich meteorites have poor magnetic memories, since they are primarily composed of iron, which has a terrible memory – you wouldn't ever make a hard drive out of iron, for instance. 'It was thought that the magnetic signals carried by metal-rich meteorites would have been written and rewritten many times during their lifetime, so no-one has ever bothered to study their magnetic properties in any detail.' The particular meteorites used for this study are known as pallasites, which are mostly made up of iron and nickel, studded with gem-quality silicate crystals. Contained within these unassuming chunks of iron however, are tiny particles just 100 nanometres across – about one thousandth the width of a human hair. These are made of a unique magnetic mineral called tetrataenite, which is magnetically much more stable than the rest of the meteorite, and holds a message going back billions of years. 'We're taking ancient magnetic field measurements in nanoscale materials to the highest ever resolution in order to piece together the magnetic history of asteroids – it's like a cosmic archaeological mission,' said PhD student James Bryson, the paper's lead author. The study changes scientist's perspective on the way magnetic fields were generated during the early life of the solar system. In their meteorites, scientists have been able to capture both the beginning and the end of core freezing. 'It's like a cosmic archaeological mission,' said James Bryson. Pictured is the Gemind meteor shower . These meteorites came from asteroids created in the first few million years after the formation of the solar system. At that time, planetary bodies were heated by radioactive decay to temperatures hot enough to cause them to melt and segregate into a liquid metal core surrounded by a rocky mantle. Tiny particles, smaller than one thousandth the width of a human hair, are trapped within the metal of meteorites. These tiny pieces of metal have retained the magnetic signature of the parent asteroid from its birth in the early solar system. They reveal the process by which the asteroid's core froze, killing its magnetic field. It's a process that is happening on a much larger scale to Earth. In their meteorites, scientists have been able to capture both the beginning and the end of core freezing. The information will help them understand how these processes affected the Earth in the past and provide a possible glimpse of what might happen in the future. Scientists now think that the Earth's core only began to freeze relatively recently in geological terms, maybe less than a billion years ago. How this freezing has affected the Earth's magnetic field is not known. As their cores cooled and began to freeze, the swirling motions of liquid metal, generated a magnetic field, just as the Earth does today. 'It's funny that we study other bodies in order to learn more about the Earth,' said Professor Bryson. 'Since asteroids are much smaller than the Earth, they cooled much more quickly, so these processes occur on shorter timescales, enabling us to study the whole process of core solidification.' Scientists now think that the Earth's core only began to freeze relatively recently in geological terms, maybe less than a billion years ago. How this freezing has affected the Earth's magnetic field is not known. 'In our meteorites we've been able to capture both the beginning and the end of core freezing, which will help us understand how these processes affected the Earth in the past and provide a possible glimpse of what might happen in the future,' said Professor Harrison. However, the Earth's core is freezing rather slowly. The solid inner core is getting bigger, and eventually the liquid outer core will disappear, killing the Earth's magnetic field, which protects us from the sun's radiation. 'There's no need to panic just yet, however,' said Professor Harrison. 'The core won't completely freeze for billions of years, and chances are, the sun will get us first.' Using an intense beam of x-rays to image the nanoscale magnetisation of the meteoritic metal, researchers led by the University of Cambridge were able to capture the precise moment when the core of the meteorite’s parent asteroid froze. The measurements were made by the Bessy II synchrotron in Berlin (pictured)","Scientists have captured dying moments of meteorite's magnetic field .

"It seems Prince George's brother or sister is driving consumer sales and shopping trends even before he or she is born. In an effort to emulate the Duchess of Cambridge's seemingly effortless pregnancy style and grace, mothers-to-be are flocking to have their own pregnancy captured, with a 43 per cent rise in 'bump portraits'. So desperate are they to copy Kate's pre-natal look that some women are even coming into the photography studio clutching pictures of the young royal, hoping to exactly mimic her hands-under-the-bump pose. Scroll down for video . Sabina, from Greenwich, London, is six months pregnant and was inspired to adopt a Kate-like pose as well as emulating her high-fashion maternity wear for her shoot . Women have been inspired by Kate to want to document their pregnancy and continue to dress fashionably, with the highest increase in demand for bump portraits coming from women in her age group  (left is Sazia Samad, 38, from London, six months pregnant) Venture Studios has reported a 43 per cent year-or-year increase in women seeking 'bump portraits' during November, December and the first few weeks of January after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced they were expecting their second child. The photographic styling and age-group representative of this demand also suggests that the increase has been down to the 'Kate effect'. Demand for 'bump portraits' has been particularly marked amongst mothers-to-be in their 30s, with a 57 per cent increase in orders from this age group. Hikaru Kobayashi, 38, who is eight months pregnant, adopts a protective pose such as those loved by Kate . Kate's demure yet elegant maternity fashion has inspired a move away from highly staged Demi Moore reminiscent shots to very natural, traditional portraits, such as the picture of Caroline Wade (left) and Deborah Lally, 8 months pregnant . Kate's fashion choices during her first pregnancy with Prince George were widely praised and expelled the idea that maternity wear meant tent-like dresses and elasticated waist bands. This, coupled with having seen Kate's pregnancy documented on camera at every stage, has inspired other women to make a lasting record of their own maternity journey. This is reflected in the style of portrait requested has also been significant, with a move away from highly staged Demi Moore reminiscent shots to very natural, traditional portraits celebrating mothers' individual looks, similar to the manner that we see the expectant Kate at public events. A number of pregnant women have even arrived at their shoots clutching pictures of Kate and her bump to recreate her specific pose and look. High fashion is now very much embraced by pregnant women (such as Sazia Samad) thanks to Kate's example . A number of women have even arrived at their shoots clutching pictures of Kate and her bump to recreate her specific pose and look (left: Hikaru Kobayashi, 38, who is eight months pregnant) Richard Mayfield, Creative Director for Venture Studios, said; 'Since November we have seen a notable increase in portraits of pregnant women at our studios - especially amongst those in their 30s. 'Women not only want to mark this important moment in their lives, they are also more confident about being themselves and maintaining their individual styles - even with a changing body shape. 'Celebrities such as Kate Middleton who actually incorporate their bumps into their usual glamorous look has perhaps inspired women and reassured them that they can still look amazing and make the most of fashion even when pregnant.' The Kate effect also applies to the Duchess's fashion choices with the £195 'Natasha' coat by Séraphine which the Duchess wore earlier this week having sold out . Caroline Wade, 35, a PR and portrait painter from Muswell Hill in London is four months pregnant and says the Duchess inspired her to have a fashionable pregnancy and to capture it on camera. 'After spending most of my adult life controlling my figure, the fact that your stomach is meant to stick out in pregnancy is an interesting shift in perspective! 'It reminds you that what your body can do is so much more powerful than how it looks. 'I have to say all the coverage of Kate being pregnant and glamorous inspired me to do the shoot. I didn't expect to still feel attractive when I was pregnant but it is still you, just you with a bump. 'It is also easier at this early stage to look good as you can still mix and match your normal clothes with maternity things as Kate has been doing.'","Rise seen since Duke and Duchess announced expecting second child .

Arrested: Joseph Coddington (left) and Quenton harris (right) were arrested on Friday for allegedly tying up Joseph's mother Regina Coddington in attempt to steal her guns . Deputies were called to Regina Coddington's home at around 2 p.m. on Saturday after a neighbor allegedly saw the teens climb in through a storm window. Rockdale County Police say when they arrived that they found the woman tied to her bed by her hands and feet with a purple rope. Regina Coddington told police that her son threatened to kill her if she called for help and that they dragged her around the home and tied her up. Regina Coddington said her son told her, 'We can do this the hard way or the easy way.' Police say that in the dining room of the home they found a locked steel gun case that'd been allegedly hammered at by the teens who were attempting to open it. Police also found a crowbar, a drill, and safety glasses alongside the case.

Arsenal's 4-1 win over Wigan at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night means . that Arsene Wenger's side moved on to 70 points and goal difference of 34 with . goals scored at 71 for the season. On Sunday the Gunners travel to Newcastle, who have nothing to play for. Join the debate, join our Hangout today LIVE at Upton Park from 1pm... This means that if Chelsea were to . draw with Everton at Stamford Bridge on the final day and Arsenal beat Newcastle by one goal and also concede at least one - . so 2-1, 3-2, 4-3 etc - then they will be all square. With third place in the Premier . League qualifying for the group stages of the Champions League rather . than having to go through a qualifier, it means finishing third is a big . advantage. Sportsmail understands that the Premier League are preparing for the possibility of a play-off, should it come to that. The possibility of an end of season play-off has been planned for in the past, back in the 1995-96 season when Manchester United and Newcastle United were fighting it out for the title. Despite being neck and neck for much of the  run-in, United won the league without the need for a play-off. It is understood that if there is a play-off then it would be as soon after the end of season as possible and while there is no location set for an eventual play-off, it is almost certain to be in London. The problem for the Premier League would be when to play such a match - Chelsea have an end-of-season tour to the USA to play friendlies against Manchester City next week, and then there are England friendlies on May 29 against the Republic of Ireland and then in Brazil on June 2. But it is understood the Premier League would want it to be played as soon as possible as neither club would want the season to stretch into June but the play-off regulation is part of PL rules.

"Seven months after revealing she had been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer, former Good Morning America host Joan Lunden has urged all other women suffering from the disease to remain positive about their prognosis. 'I'll tell you. One of the best ways to get through it is with your attitude,' Lunden told the Today show's Matt Lauer about beginning radiation treatment this month. The former TV anchor, 64, appeared on the morning show on Tuesday in order to share an emotional update about her treatment, following the lumpectomy and 16 rounds of chemotherapy she completed in 2014. Scroll down for video . Winning the war: Joan London appeared on the Today Show on Tuesday to share an update on her breast cancer prognosis, seven months after she was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of the disease . Ms Lunden, who is currently undergoing radiation treatment five days a week, admitted that she was hesitant to mention the tremendous amount of support she has received from her husband and older daughters. She explained that fans often write to her to remind her that they have no one and it saddens them to hear about her family's role in her recovery. 'When you say that to me, I cry,' she said of the letters. 'But it's a good reminder for me because I have kind of been thrust out there, in the front of this breast cancer, to be a voice for everyone.' The author and breast cancer advocate said that after finishing her last round of chemotherapy on December 3 she finally feels like she is nearing the end of her battle with the disease. 'This is the very very first time that I have been close enough to the finish line to actually feel like I can see the finish line,' she said of her ongoing treatments. 'You know for me - and everyone is different - radiation is a walk in the park after chemo.' Ms Lunden was in great spirits and jokingly told Mr Lauer: 'You have more hair than I do.

Ms Lunden, who was happy to report that she felt strong enough to travel with her family over the holiday, said it was important to keep a sense of normalcy for both her and her loved ones. 'I want [my children] to be able to get up in the morning and go to school and not thinking: ""Gosh, is mommy going to be okay? Is she going to live?"" I try to be as normal as I can.' She said that she hears from women who are bald and admit that they wear sweats and no longer put on makeup – and she urged them to try and get out and to spend as much time with other people as possible . 'You can kind of get burrowed down in that and become the sick cancer patient,' she said. Ms Lunden added: 'Be with people. Go out to a movie. Laugh, find ways to laugh.' She also advised women to adjust their attitudes so one bad day doesn't turn into a bad month. 'All of a sudden, somebody is woe is me, and it is very easy to let one bad day do that to you,' she said. 'But we have the ability at any moment in time to change your mind about how you are feeling that day.' She noted: 'Even if you are feel a little crummy, just remember that what we are going through that makes us feel crummy one day is killing off all the cancer in our bodies.' After she completes radiation, Ms Lunden said she has to wait three month before getting her first mammogram, ultrasound and MRI checkup.

"A teenager is living a unique double life both as a man - and a woman. Some days Layla Warlow, 18, wakes up and chooses to wear a dress and heels to work, while others she's a man and dons baggy jeans and workmen boots. The youth centre volunteer from Swansea, South Wales, can spend as long as three months as her male counterpart Layton then suddenly switch to Layla for as little as a day. Scroll down for video . Layla Warlow can spend as long as three months as Layton then suddenly switch to Layla (above) Growing up, Layla preferred masculine clothes and originally thought she was transgender - a man born in a woman's body. But, at the age of 16, she realised that she missed the feminine side of herself and gradually realised that she identifies as bi-gender, a term used for people who move between both sexes. Some past employers have done a double take when Layla suddenly turns up for work dressed as Layton. Layla said: 'It is very confusing when I first meet someone. A lot of people just don't understand it as it's something they've never come across before. Layla says she has no control over whether she's going to be Layton (above) or Layla on a certain day . 'It isn't a case of me waking up and choosing to dress a certain way. I've got no control over whether I'm going to be Layton or Layla on a certain day. 'Living as bi-gender is extremely frustrating. 'As Layla, I wear lots of make up and love showing off my cleavage. Yet, when I'm Layton, the sight of my breasts make me cry and I hate my feminine body. 'It's painful but I bind my breasts and often wear a fake facial hair to give me a more masculine look,' she explains. The youth centre volunteer from Swansea, South Wales, identifies as bi-gender . Layla's unusual gender identity doesn't just affect her clothes, it also affects her sexuality. As Layton, she is attracted to women and, as Layla, she is attracted to men. 'Relationships are nearly impossible as I constantly switch between two genders. I've been on dates before and I do get chatted up but it never goes any further as they find it hard to come to grips with my situation,' says Layla. Her mannerisms even change, with friends saying that is she is much quieter and more giggly when she is Layla while Layton is outspoken and fiery. Layton loves football and is a bit of a lad and Layla prefers time alone and hates sports. Growing up with her aunt, Layla first began questioning her sexuality when she was 13, originally identifying as bisexual and then wondering if she could be transgender as she felt uncomfortable with her feminine body. As a child she preferred trousers to skirts and begged her aunt to let her cut her hair short. By the time she turned 16 she was dressing as a male every day for school and, soon after, began living as transgender, binding her breasts and wearing male clothes. Yet after two weeks she realised that she missed being a woman and found the term bi-gender while researching online. Layla says she has no control over whether she's going to be Layton (left) or Layla (right) on a certain day . Layla hopes to raise more awareness for bi-genderism, which has become a gender option on Facebook . She said: 'I found a bi-gender group on Facebook with hundreds of members and suddenly I didn't quite feel so alone. It was an amazing moment. 'I started talking to other bi-gender people from all over the world and at last felt comfortable in my own skin. 'Sometimes I envy people who know which gender they are supposed to be. For me, it's a constant battle. 'I have spent most of my teenage life in turmoil over this. Sometimes, I wonder why I can't wake up as the same person for the rest of my life but I've gradually learned to accept both Layton and Layla.' Being bi-gender has also caused problems for Layla finding work. After finding a bi-gender group on Facebook with hundreds of members shed suddenly didn't feel so alone . 'Most employers aren't very understanding when their feminine worker suddenly turns up dressed as a man. No I work at a youth centre and thankfully they're completely supportive of my gender. They even let me have two name tags depending on which sex I come into work as,' she says. 'I know some people may think it is an act, but it is something that I can't help. It is all subconscious - I even have to have two types of shower gel to please both genders. 'It has taken a while but I have finally accepted that I am bi-gender, it is just something people have to get used to and it is completely natural.' Layla has set up an LGBTQ Facebook group for people to go to for advice . Layla hopes to raise more awareness for bi-genderism, which has recently become a gender option on Facebook. She has set up an LGBTQ Facebook group (called LGBTQ nationwide) for people to go to for advice who may be confused over their sexuality and gender. Layla said: 'Making friends is so hard, they are always really confused when they have known me as Layton for two or three months all of a sudden he has transformed into a woman with no explanation. 'I have to explain myself to everyone and I wish there was more information available to people who have never heard of the term bi-gender - I still haven't met another bi-gender person. 'It has taken years for transgender people to become acceptable in society and I think it will be a long road ahead before people stop understand bi-genderism.'","Bi-gender Layla Warlow, 18, identifies as both sexes .

"A thief who shot a have-a-go hero when the brave man tried to stop his brother from being robbed was lynched to death by furious friends and family. Twenty-two-year-old Alexis Jimenez had returned from giving his girlfriend a ride home early in the morning when he was attacked by two men in the western Argentinian city of Tucuman, the Buenos Aires Herald reported. The young man's brother Cesar, 28, heard the commotion outside his house and went to see what was happening when thief Daniel Gustavo Guerrero pulled out a 9mm pistol and shot him in the neck before fleeing. Thief Daniel Guerrero's was surrounded and attacked by an angry mob of neighbours who had beat him to death for shooting dead Alexis Jimenez in the western Argentinean city of Tucaman . Cesar Jimenez, who worked at the National University of Tucaman and had recently welcomed a new baby daughter, died at the hospital about five hours later. He had previously been the victim of a violent robbery three years ago, when he was shot in the leg. The 5.30am gunfire woke his neighbours to the recent attack, and some of them attended to Cesar while others tracked the thief down in minutes and beat him so badly he later died, Infobae reported. When police arrived they found the battered body of Guerrero lying in a pool of his own blood and surrounded by angry locals. A video shows a man kicking him in the head and police nonchalantly asking him to stop. A friend of the Jimenezes, Bricio Paez, 30, said: 'The scum got what he deserved. 'If you kill one of ours you will get killed too. 'It's the rule of law, our law.' Police said they guarded the body from attackers while waiting for an ambulance, though observers said they stood by and some participated in the beating . Some of the Jimenezes' neighbours said that police also beat Guerrero, who had a long criminal record. However, police said that officers kept guard over the body while neighbours delayed an ambulance's arrival. Guerrero died shortly after being taken to a local hospital. Public lynch mobs in the city and region are commonplace, with this incident on Jan 11 being the second attempted killing this year. Last week a thief who stole a mobile phone was beaten unconscious by local vigilantes but survived. At the end of last year, four other similar incidents took place in the region. When asked last year for a response Governor Jose Alperovich said, 'I don't know how I would react if I was the victim of a crime. 'One has to be in their [the vigilantes'] shoes.'","Daniel Gustavo Guerrero shot Cesar Jimenez, 28, while stealing motorbike .

"Jennifer Ward, 51 (left) and Alistair Lobban, 54 (right) have been ordered to repay more than £700,000 which they pocketed through stealing gift vouchers from Asda . A supermarket accounts worker who stole £400,000 by cashing in Asda vouchers so she could enjoy a champagne lifestyle has been ordered to repay £680,000. Jennifer Ward, 51, from York, used vouchers that she was supposed to destroy to fund a six-year crime spree, which involved frittering away money on lavish holidays, jewellery and designer clothes. When police raided the account manager's home, they also found an Aladdin's cave of expensive electrical items, which had been bought using the money she stole from the supermarket chain. In total, Ward pocketed £680,000 from the scam, by making investments with the money she had stolen. Now the fraudster has been ordered to re-pay the money she made, following a court ruling under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Her 54-year-old partner Alistair Lobban, a former soldier who also made £50,000 from the scheme, must also repay his share of the money. During the hearing at Leeds Crown Court, Recorder Gregory Perrins told the pair: 'After today you will hopefully understand the consequences of what you have done.' The pair were jailed in June 2013 for a total of three years. The court had heard how Ward worked in the cash office at the retail chain, where she was responsible for destroying used vouchers which had been spent in store. She was then supposed to reconcile the accounts. But Ward abused her position of trust and began to steal cash and vouchers which were under her control. She would then falsify the accounts which she sent to Asda's head office, to cover her tracks. Police began investigating Ward after fellow Asda staff noticed her excessive spending. They also said she showed a clear 'protectiveness' in handling the in-store gift vouchers. Investigations soon showed that Ward and Lobban had bought a timeshare week at a holiday cottage in the Scilly Isles costing £30,000, had gone on a £4,000 Caribbean cruise and had also ran up £157,000 on Ward's Marks & Spencer card. When their home in York was raided, police also found a room piled high with boxes of electrical items including widescreen TVs, digital cameras and DVD players and a stack of vouchers. Gift vouchers and £30,000 worth of cash were also discovered. The accounts worker, from York, created an Aladdin's cave of expensive electrical items (pictured) which she bought with vouchers that she was supposed to destroy . Today, Financial investigator for North Yorkshire Police Paul Dowsland told the court that, after Ms Ward's crimes came to light, he combed through her accounts. Describing how Ward earned an extra £280,000 through investments, he said: 'What struck me was the sheer volume of what had been accumulated. 'It wasn't just a case of what was going into the account, but it was mushrooming and growing. The overall balance was increasing as well.' At the time of their sentencing in 2013, the pair were described by a judge as 'ordinary couple motivated by insatiable greed'. When police raided her property, they found more than £200,000 worth of Asda vouchers in her possession . As accounts manager for Asda, Jennifer Ward worked in the cash office at the retail chain. She was responsible for reconciling accounts and destroying used vouchers, which had been spent by customers in store. But, in 2004, Ward began to steal the vouchers which she was meant to destroy. She  also started stealing cash from the office. Ward would then falsify the accounts which she returned to Asda's head office, to make it look as though the vouchers had not been used. Police started to investigate Ward's accounts after fellow Asda staff noticed her excessive spending. They also said she showed 'protectiveness' in handling the in-store gift vouchers. Ward pleaded guilty to charges of theft and possessing or having control of an article for use in fraud on 13 January 2012 at York Crown Court. She got a two-year jail term. Lobban, who denied knowing about Ward's acts but was found guilty of money laundering, was jailed for 12 months . Judge Tom Bayliss told them: 'You are pleasant people but underneath it all you are motivated by insatiable greed. 'This was a gross breach of trust against your employer over a number of years. 'Your lifestyle was all funded by theft from an employer to whom you owed a duty of trust and a high level of responsibility. 'You were taking cash vouchers and rather than destroying them, you were stealing them and recycling them. This went on for many years. 'It may have started on a small scale but it escalated to a huge amount of money and you both enjoyed the fruits of that spending, which was funded by dishonesty. 'You were enjoying a lifestyle unimaginable for your earnings. We have heard that you were spending money like it was going out of fashion, and you were.' The crimes began in 2004 lasting until 2010, when Ward was arrested shortly before they embarked on a £4,000 Carribean cruise.","Jennifer Ward, 51, from York, was accounts worker for supermarket chain .

"A woman charged in a deadly 2012 house explosion in Indianapolis agreed Tuesday to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit arson and testify against her former boyfriend and his brother in the fiery natural gas blast that damaged dozens of homes. Monserrate Shirley, 49, would have to testify against ex boyfriend Mark Leonard and his brother, Bob Leonard, as well as 'any other individuals as yet uncharged' in the Nov. 10, 2012, explosion. Shirley, who had pleaded not guilty after she and the two men were charged in late 2012, appeared before a Marion County judge in a courtroom filled with current and former residents of the neighborhood marked by the blast. Monserrate Shirley is pictured leaving a court hearing after she changed her plea to guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit arson on Tuesday in Indianapolis . Monserrate Shirley would have to testify against ex boyfriend Mark Leonard (left) and his brother Bob Leonard (right) Marion Criminal Court Judge Sheila Carlisle told Shirley she was taking her plea agreement under advisement and that it could be 'months or years' before she decides whether to accept it. Shirley must first fulfill her pledge to cooperate with prosecutors against the other defendants. Under her deal, the 49-year-old would plead guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit arson and prosecutors would drop 52 charges, including two counts of murder. The deal would allow Shirley to avoid a possible sentence of life without parole. Instead, she could face from a minimum 20-year suspended sentence with probation to a maximum 50-year prison term. Prosecutors allege Shirley and the Leonard brothers rigged the blast in her home on Indianapolis' south side as part of a scheme to collect $300,000 in insurance. The explosion killed 34-year-old electronics expert Dion Longworth and his 36-year-old wife, second-grade teacher Jennifer Longworth. The blast damaged more than 80 homes, several so badly that they had to be razed. Prosecutors previously said the trio made one attempt to blow up Shirley's home that failed. But Shirley's plea agreement states that Mark Leonard and 'an uncharged individual' had earlier tried to set the home on fire. Spectators pictured entering the court room for the Monserrate Shirley plea hearing yesterday . Shirley (pictured leaving courtroom yesterday) may not have to serve any prison time under the terms of the deal . Before all three attempts, Shirley made arrangements for her, Mark Leonard and her daughter to stay elsewhere and boarded the family cat, according to court documents filed Tuesday. Marion County deputy prosecutor Denise Robinson said after the hearing that Shirley has provided information that could lead to charges against others and is 'continuing to talk' to prosecutors. Robinson called the deal 'a fair resolution' that ensures Shirley's cooperation. 'From a prosecutor's perspective it means that we have now direct evidence of the crime. In other words, we have someone who was on the inside, who was a party to making certain observations, overhearing certain statements, who's now cooperating with the state,' she said. Shirley's attorney, Jim Voyles, declined to comment following the hearing. Tony Burnett, who lived across the street from Shirley's home, said after the hearing that he was 'angry and disappointed' with the deal because it includes the possibility Shirley could get a suspended sentence. The 2012 house explosion (pictured) damaged more than 80 homes and killed two people . Monserrate Shirley leaves the court hearing on Tuesday after she changed her plea to guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit arson . 'She could walk out with nothing but time served? That doesn't sound right to me in any way — not to mention the deaths of two people,' said Burnett, who moved elsewhere after his home was razed due to the explosion. Robinson said she anticipates arguing for 'a significant sentence' for Shirley. Court documents said Shirley was facing mounting financial woes, including $63,000 in credit card debt. A friend of Mark Leonard's told investigators Leonard said he had lost about $10,000 at a casino weeks before the explosion, according to court documents. Prosecutors have said investigators determined that Shirley's home filled up with gas after a gas fireplace valve and a gas line regulator were removed. A microwave, apparently set to start on a timer, sparked the explosion. Mark Leonard's trial is scheduled to begin June 4 in St. Joseph County. It's unclear when Bob Leonard will be tried. Messages seeking comment left Tuesday for the brothers' attorneys were not immediately returned. Indianapolis defense attorney Bob Hammerle, who is not involved in the case, said Shirley's testimony would have a significant impact on the brothers' defenses. But he also noted the brothers' attorneys can challenge Shirley's credibility, given that she initially claimed to be as much a victim of the explosion as her neighbors.","Monserrate Shirley, 49, would have to testify against former boyfriend Mark Leonard and his brother in the plea deal .

"Claims: Victoria Wasteney (picture yesterday) launched an employment tribunal against the East London NHS Trust, claiming her employers discriminated against her because of her religion . A Christian health worker has told an employment tribunal that the NHS trust she works for did not clear her of bullying a Muslim colleague because it was 'politically incorrect'. Victoria Wasteney, 37, was disciplined for alleged bullying and harassment after Enya Nawaz, 25, told managers that the senior occupational health therapist had tried to convert her to Christianity. Today, Miss Wasteney launched an employment tribunal against the East London NHS Trust, claiming her employers discriminated against her because of her religion. Miss Wasteney accused the NHS of making her look like a 'religious nutcase' and said she never attempted to convert Miss Nawaz. She told the tribunal that she believed she and Miss Nawaz were friends and alleged Miss Nawaz was 'manipulated' into complaining against her by colleagues who had an anti-Christian agenda. Today Miss Wasteney claimed the Trust had failed to clear her of wrongdoing after a nine-month disciplinary process because it would be 'politically incorrect' to find a Christian innocent. The Trust insists the disciplinary hearing was fair and they deny they discriminated against Miss Wasteney. Miss Wasteney told the East London Employment Tribunal that her professional career 'had been jeopardised, her reputation damaged and relations with colleagues ruined. She added: 'I was subjected to an ordeal of persecution dressed as a ""disciplinary action"" for an extraordinarily long time. 'All this was a result of a manifestly false complaint and it was obvious I had done nothing wrong. I was discriminated against because of my faith.' Miss Wasteney, who describes herself as a born-again Christian, was working at the John Howard Centre, a secure psychiatric hospital in Homerton, East London. She said she was always careful about discussing her religion at work because her managers had warned her it could 'get you in trouble'. After Miss Nawaz joined the hospital as a newly qualified occupational therapist in 2012, the two women discussed Islam and Christianity, as well as work done by Miss Wasteney's church to campaign against human trafficking. Miss Wasteney told the Daily Mail this week her colleague had 'definitely initiated' the conversations, before she invited Miss Nawaz to attend church events linked to the anti-trafficking work. She said Miss Nawaz had then come to her in tears because she was upset about health problems. Miss Wasteney said: 'I put my hand on her knee to comfort her and asked if that was okay, and said 'Would you like me to pray for you?' 'She said yes, so I asked for God to bring peace and healing. She left the office afterwards and said she was okay.' Miss Wasteney also gave Miss Nawaz a book, I Dared to Call Him Father, about a Muslim woman who converts to Christianity, but denied it was an attempt to make Miss Nawaz convert. She said she was shocked to learn her junior had made a formal complaint, but said Miss Nawaz had previously told her she had come under pressure from colleagues to do so. The East London NHS Foundation Trust investigated Miss Nawaz's eight-page complaint in June 2013. Miss Wasteney was suspended on full pay for nine months while the investigation was carried out. Gift: Miss Wasteney gave Miss Nawaz a book, I Dared to Call Him Father, about a Muslim woman who converts to Christianity, but denied it was an attempt to make Miss Nawaz convert . A disciplinary hearing dismissed some of the allegations but upheld three complaints related to the book, the invitation to church events and Miss Wasteney's offer to pray for Miss Nawaz. It ruled that the episodes amounted to misconduct. Miss Wasteney was given a written warning, although she was not sacked and continues to work in another area of the trust. The claimant told the court she had been previously investigated by the Trust because of her involvement in the Discover Life Group, a Christian group for service users. She said although the allegations were 'unsubstantiated,' the process had bred ill feeling among other staff members, who tried to warn Miss Nawaz away from her. She told the tribunal the compliant was made against this background. The claimant added: 'There had been a history of pressure being put on her to make a false complaint of this nature by certain people among the staff, probably motivated by religious prejudice.' She was suspended on the grounds of 'gross misconduct' - making her feel as though she was already seen as 'guilty' and her boss had been looking for an excuse to investigate her faith. A hearing was  held in February 2014, during which the claimant was told there had been a breakdown in the 'firewall' between her personal beliefs and her work, which she said made her faith seem as though it was a 'virus.' She was given a final written warning as a result, which was later reduced to first written warning on appeal. The claimant said: 'Despite these concessions, I find the outcome of the appeal unsatisfactory. 'Harassment and bullying are serious allegations, which were made against me but never substantiated. 'Simply put it was felt to be politically incorrect to find that a Christian was innocent. I am innocent of misconduct at work, and the respondent must acknowledge that.' She returned to work in March 2014, but said staff were made to see her as a 'religious nutcase' and the 'hostility' she experienced pressured her into changing roles. Miss Wasteney, who describes herself as a born-again Christian, was working at the John Howard Centre, a secure psychiatric hospital in Homerton, East London (pictured), overseen by the East London NHS Trust . Ben Collins, representing the East London NHS Trust alleged Miss Wasteney used her senior position to pressurise Miss Nawaz into going to services at the Christian Revival Church. He told the  tribunal Miss Nawaz had said: 'I had texts from Miss Wasteney about prayer meetings. It is hard to say no to someone so senior.' He also quoted a series of text messages between the claimant and Miss Nawaz in which she uses the fact she was 'stuck in traffic' as a reason for not being able to make a meeting. Mr Collins told the tribunal: 'You said, “pray God to hurry you”. Could she have been giving excuses for not wanting to come?' But Miss Wasteney said she was inviting Miss Nawaz to attend a social event at the church, which met at the O2 centre in North Greenwich, as she would invite a colleague to an exercise class. Mr Collins told the court after a text message exchange in which Miss Nawaz described how her parents were involved in setting up a mosque in Birmingham, Miss Wasteney had responded: 'Jesus is the one who leads us into truth. I am so excited by what is being stirred in your spirit, making it into His presence is truly life changing.' He said: 'Part of the case against you is that you are proselytising. Going back to the phrase ""Jesus leads us into truth"" you can see how your actions might have that effect.' The tribunal continues.","Christian nurse Miss Wasteney prayed with Muslim co-worker, tribunal told .

"More than seven years after six family members were gunned down on Christmas Eve in a small farming town east of Seattle, the trial began Tuesday for one of two people charged in their killings. In opening statements, King County Senior Deputy Prosecutor Scott O'Toole told jurors at least 16 rounds were fired inside the Carnation home, and there was no doubt the person who committed the crime was Joseph McEnroe. McEnroe and his former girlfriend, Michele Anderson, are accused of shooting her parents, brother, sister-in-law, 5-year-old niece and 3-year-old nephew during a holiday gathering in 2007. McEnroe and Anderson are each charged with six counts of aggravated murder. Murder Trial: Joseph McEnroe and his girlfriend at the time, Michele Anderson, are accused of shooting her parents, brother, sister-in-law, 5-year-old niece and 3-year-old nephew on Christmas Eve 2007 . Massace: Wayne and Judy Anderson (pictured) were the first to be killed by their daughter, Michele Anderson, and her boyfriend at the time, Joseph McEnroe . Erica and Scott  Anderson (pictured) and their children were fatally shot during a holiday gathering in 2007 . Murdered: Theww-year-old Nathan and five-year-old Olivia . Jurors dabbed their eyes as the prosecutor described the killings in graphic detail. Relatives of the victims were present in the Seattle courtroom. O'Toole said jurors would hear a lot of difficult information but nothing to explain the 'callousness' of the slayings, the Seattle Times reported. Defense attorney Leo Hamaji told jurors that McEnroe was coerced by his mentally ill girlfriend into killing the family. Hamaji asked jurors to keep an open mind and said McEnroe lacked the 'psychological wherewithal' to escape Michele Anderson's influence. 'He did not premeditate this,' Hamaji said. The King County sheriff's office said McEnroe and Anderson first shot her parents, Wayne and Judy Anderson, and dragged the bodies from the home to a backyard shed, according to court documents. Standing trial: Officers from the King County Jail lead Joseph McEnroe, left, into King County Superior Court, Tuesday morning January 20, 2015 in Seattle for opening statements in his trial . The two shot Anderson's brother, Scott, his wife, Erica, and their two children soon after when they arrived for dinner. 'In all, at least 16 rounds were fired by the defendants inside the Anderson home,' King County Senior Deputy Prosecutor Scott O’Toole told the court Tuesday, according to The Times. 'There is no doubt the person who committed these crimes is seated in this courtroom, and his name is Joe McEnroe.' As O’Toole discussed McEnroe killing Olivia, 5, and Nathan, 3, while their mother, Erica Anderson, tried to protect them, O'Toole said. 'Nathan climbed into his mother's arms having witnessed his father being shot, his sister being shot, his mother being used for target practice,' O'Toole said, according to King 5. 'He climbed into her arms for safety and this man put a bullet in Nathan's head.' McEnroe and Anderson had been living in a mobile home on her parents' rural property about 30 miles east of Seattle, where the shootings occurred. The mobile home was about 200 yards from the house where the murders occurred. Joseph McEnroe wipes his head as he waits for proceedings to begin in King County Superior Court Tuesday . Anderson's trial was delayed by questions about her competency. It is scheduled for the fall.

"It appears that prison has been no holiday camp for wife killer Drew Peterson as his latest mugshot reveals. The 60-year-old convict appeared to have put on weight and developed deep under-eye bags while his trademark goatee had turned almost entirely gray. The former cop is being held by the Illinois Department of Corrections as he awaits the appeals court's decision on offering him a new trial. Scroll down for video . Wife killer Drew Peterson, 60, appeared more haggard in the latest mugshots released from the Illinois Department of Corrections where he is serving 38 years . The first arguments from his defense lawyers in the appeal are to be held in April at the earliest, according to Radar Online. Peterson was found guilty in 2012 for the murder of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, eight years before. On March 1, 2004, Ms Savio was discovered by a neighbor face down in her dry bathtub, her thick, black hair soaked in blood and a two-inch gash in the back of her head. The  death of the 40-year-old aspiring nurse was initially deemed an accident. After Peterson's fourth wife, 23-year-old Stacy Peterson, vanished in 2007, Savio's body was exhumed, re-examined and her death reclassified as a homicide. Peterson had divorced Savio a year before her death. His motive for killing her, prosecutors said, was fear that a pending settlement would wipe him out financially . He is currently serving 38 years for her murder and is not due to be released until May 2050 when he will be well into his nineties. Questions remain about Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy, who has been missing since 2007 and whose body has never been found. Peterson, a former cop, is serving 38 years for the murder of his third wife, Kathleen Savio (pictured) in 2004 . Peterson revealed in 2013 that he lived in fear of being killed behind bars. According to a letter to his lawyer at the time, he was not adapting well to his new home. 'I’m in a cell the size of a broom closet, peeling paint, rusting fixtures, I have no TV or anything and I haven’t been out since I got here,' he wrote to his former attorney Joel Brodsky in one letter. 'Prison is all the nightmarish things that one would think.' Peterson is incarcerated at the Menard Correctional Center in Chester, Illinois where he is being held in protective custody throughout his sentence because of his former profession as a cop. Drew Peterson's 2012 trial was the first in Illinois history where prosecutors built their case on hearsay thanks in part to a new law, dubbed ‘Drew's Law,’ tailored to the case. The hearsay, prosecutors said, let his wives ‘speak from their graves’ through family and friends. The hearsay - any information reported by a witness not based on the witness' direct knowledge - included a friend who said Savio told her Peterson once put a knife to her throat and warned her: ‘I could kill you and make it look like an accident.’ Savio so feared for her life that she kept a knife under her mattress. Stacy Peterson (pictured) was just 19 and 26 years younger than her husband when they married. She  mysteriously vanished in 2007. Her body has never been found . A former co-worker of Peterson's, Jeff Pachter, testified that Peterson offered him $25,000 to hire a hit man to kill Savio, though he never followed through. Peterson was 26 years older than his fourth wife, Stacy, when they married, only eight days after his third divorce was finalized. Four years later, the 23-year-old went missing in 2007. This disappearance prompted Illinois State Police and the FBI to investigate, and they later had Savio's body exhumed, re-examined and her death reclassified as a homicide. When her sister called the police reporting Stacy's disappearance, Peterson said that she had called him several days before and said that she left him for another man. Her car was found at the airport. One of the biggest aspects in the case of her disappearance was the issue of whether or not he disposed of her body in a large blue container, three of which he bought prior to when she went missing. Stacy Peterson's family hoped a conviction in Savio's murder could lead to charges against Drew Peterson in Stacy's disappearance. Stacy's pastor, Neil Schori, testified she told him that her husband got up from bed and left their house in the middle of the night around the time of Savio's death. Before his 2009 arrest, the glib, cocky Peterson seemed to taunt authorities, suggesting a ‘Win a Date With Drew Contest’ and then, after his arrest, ‘Win a Conjugal Visit With Drew Contest.’","The 60-year-old convict looked fatter, with deep under-eye bags and his trademark goatee was almost entirely gray in new mugshot .

"After child pornography scandals, explicit gore, and a celebrity nude photo leak the creator of 4chan finally decided to step down as the site's administrator. Chris Poole who goes by 'moot' founded the anonymous social site 11 years ago when he was just 15-years-old and announced his difficult decision to quit on Wednesday. Poole published his resignation on the site at 11:00 am that began, 'I founded 4chan eleven and a half years ago at the age of 15, and after more than a decade of service, I've decided it's time for me to move on.' His goodbye states that he's worked over the years to satisfy the millions of webpage visitors and also maintain the finances and resources to keep the site running and that he's succeeded. Stepping down: Chris Poole who goes by 'moot' founded the anonymous social site 11 years ago when he was just 15-years-old and announced his difficult decision to quit on Wednesday . Anonymous sharing: The biggest difference between 4chan and other forums is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously . 'As 4chan's sole administrator, decision maker, and keeper of most of its institutional knowledge, I've come to represent an uncomfortably large single point of failure,' wrote Poole who has decided to pass off his duties to a group of volunteers despite still 'calling the shots.' I'll need time away to decompress and reflect, but I look forward to one day returning to 4chan as its Admin Emeritus or just another Anonymous, and also writing more about my experience running 4chan on my personal blog,' writes Poole who says he may return someday. Poole said that from a user's perspective nothing should change and that his team of experts will help him make the transition as he steps down as administrator. This Friday afternoon Poole plans on hosting a live question and answer session on the site and says he'll be reading all his emails at moot@4chan.org should anyone have any additional queries. 4chan is an anonymous photo sharing site along with a comment board whose greatest strength of anonymity has also become a problem area. Long leadership:  4chan was originally meant to be a forum to discuss Japanese anime and post photos. The image board site soon grew to by much more, and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world . Leaked: Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted to 4chan which then circulated the web . An anonymous individual sparked some scandal this past August after dumping dozens of naked photographs of female celebrities onto the 4chan online forum. Hundreds of leaked photos of celebrities followed. Among those celebrities whose photos were shared were Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Kristen Dunst and Kaley Cuoco, to name a few. Photos of Olympic Gymnast McKayla Maroney were also included on the site and it was later discovered that photos of Maroney were taken while she was underage and therefore qualified as child pornography. A Murderous confession along with photos of a corpse were also shared on the anonymous board. In November, David Kalac was accused of brutally murdering Amber Lynn Coplin in her home in Port Orchard, Washington, before going on the run and leaving her 13-year-old son to discover the body when he came home from school. Child pornography: Photos of Gold medalist USA's Mc Kayla Maroney were also posted on the site but they  were taken when she was underage and were therefore child pornography . Kalac is said to have posted pictured of Colin's naked body on a bed with red marks around her neck on 4chan. 'Check the news for Port Orchard Washington in a few hours,' said a 4chan message, viewed by Dailymail.com . 'Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops. 'I just wanted to share the pics before they find me. I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough. When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicide by cop. 'I understand the doubts. Just check the f***ing news. I have to lose my phone now, ‘said the chilling post. In addition to posting leaked nude images and gruesome murders, 4chan has also been a place for popular memes, celebrity rumors to swirl, and harsh cyber-bullying among other topics. Created in 2003 by a 15-year-old high school student from New York City, Christopher Poole, 4chan was originally meant to be a forum to discuss Japanese anime and post photos. The image board site soon grew to by much more, and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world. The biggest difference between 4chan and other websites however is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously, giving many free reign to do things they would not do otherwise. While this has led to the site producing some amusing and funny pranks, many are horrific and have led to the arrest of the person or persons who created them. LOLCats – The Internet obsession with cats actually began back in 2005 when one 4Chan commenter decided to post as a photo of a cat waiting for Caturday. It all took off from there. Rickroll – In 2007, a fake link to the trailer for the video game Grand Theft Auto IV was posted to the site after the website of the game’s publisher, Rockstar Games, crashed. Instead of seeing a look at the highly anticipated new game, eager fans were instead taken to the YouTube page for the Rick Astley music video “Never Gonna Give You Up.” Steve Jobs Death – In 2008 members on the site spread a false rumor that Steve Jobs was dead, causing Apple stock prices to plummet a whopping 10% in one day. Send Justin Bieber To North Korea – Justin Bieber has long been a target for the site, and in 2010 he wanted fans to tell him where they wanted him to go on his My World Tour. 4Chan users hacked his site, and the overwhelming winner was North Korea. The Canadian did not ultimately make the trip. Jessi Slaughter – In what may have been their most vicious attack to date, members of 4Chan began to cyberbully an 11-year-old girl after claiming she was having a relationship with an older man. They posted her address, called her house, and spread false rumors and reports about her and her family. The threats got so bad that the young girl was put in police protection at one point. Trayvon Martin – In 2012 a 4Chan hacker and white supremacist falsely claimed they had hacked into Trayvon Martin’s email and Facebook accounts after his murder, posting emails and photos that were supposed to back up the false claim that Martin was a drug addict and dealer. Cutting For Bieber – In early 2013, a member of 4Chan created an elaborate Twitter hoax in which they urged fans of Justin Bieber to cut themselves so the pop star would stop smoking weed. Soon, the hashtags #cutforbieber and #cuttingforbieber amassed numerous photos of fans who claimed to have slashed their wrists and forearms over Bieber's drug use. Taylor Swift's Biggest Fan – In 2013 Taylor Swift, like Bieber, wanted fans to help her out with her next contest. She was looking for her biggest fan, and 4Chan made sure the winner was a 39-year-old man named Charles who wanted to ‘sniff Taylor’s hair.’ The contest was ultimately cancelled. Celebrity Nude Leaks – Nothing 4Chan has done has had a bigger impact however than the leaking of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities in 2014, something that eventually led to the FBI getting involved. Victims included A-list stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Gabrielle Union, Kim Kardashian and Rihanna.","Chris Poole who goes by 'moot' founded the anonymous social site 11 years ago  and announced his difficult decision to quit on Wednesday .

"At the age of 90, the international concert pianist Menahem Pressler played Mozart’s piano concerto number 23 to rapturous applause in Oxford’s Sheldonian Theatre last year and, for an encore, a Schubert moment musicale — no printed music score, just memory and perfect co-ordination. It was an astonishing accomplishment for any individual, let alone one in his tenth decade. Yet when I asked Pressler afterwards how he was able to perform such a feat, he told me it all came down to luck — not only luck with his genes, but luck to have ‘music to give my life meaning’. Of course, we cannot all play an instrument to concert performance standard, but we can all find that bit of luck — that meaning in life — which will make our old age a fulfilled and happy one, and thus leave us feeling younger for longer. In the earlier parts of this series, I have explained the importance that health and fitness play in defying the years. But I believe the social and psychological effects of growing old are equally important to address — and are often overlooked by doctors, with the inevitable focus on physical health in our later years. In fact, the older you get, the greater the need for a positive mental attitude and some positive action. After all, a human being is so much more than the sum of all their organs and systems. WATCH YOUR WELLBEING . The World Health Organisation has defined health as ‘complete physical, social and mental wellbeing’ — a state that few people achieve! However, many older people with long-term health conditions are nevertheless in a state of social and mental wellbeing. On the other hand, there are many younger people who have no disease but who do not seem to be in a state of wellbeing at all. Wellbeing, then, is an attitude of mind. Some people appear to be better able to adjust to setbacks and tragedies than others. This is what is called resilience, and probably stems from early childhood, but it is possible to become more resilient and change your life for the better. Try this little auditing process: . As well as being a cause for celebration, it is a reminder of the need to reflect, think, learn, decide and act to live a full and rewarding life. A BUSY LIFE IS A HAPPY LIFE . Retirement comes as a welcome relief to many people, especially those engaged in unsatisfactory or depressing jobs. But even some of them find adjustment to their new life difficult. The Prince of Wales has helped launched an initiative called PRIME: The Prince’s Initiative for Mature Enterprise . For people who have had rewarding jobs in which they gained pleasure from using their skills and experience, and respect and positive feedback from the people they were serving, retirement can be a blow. Pre-retirement education, which is offered by many companies, can reduce the adverse effects, but the best approach is to regard retirement as just another change in occupation, albeit one in which your income drops, dramatically for some people. Yes, part of the time should certainly be filled doing the things you have always wanted to do but have not had the time to do when working. But research has proven that continuing to interact and work with others is very good for you as well as for them — maintaining and improving your intellectual functioning. The way it does this is not clear, but it may stem from the need to argue and defend your point of view as well as the need to organise your thoughts. It may also be the interaction with other people that stimulates the mind, and that the increased motivation and morale which results from this improves how you think and how you feel. Working to boost the wellbeing of others is particularly rewarding. Here are a few suggestions of what you might want to do: . GET TO THE HEART OF DEPRESSION . Depression is a common emotional challenge for many people aged 70 and upwards. Some people will indeed need medication for it, but for many people the solution is to think differently — take more exercise, and become more engaged with other people. This is not simply a case of saying ‘pull yourself together’. It recognises that depressive thoughts are common and sometimes very serious, and that there are both good reasons to be depressed at 70 or 80, and good measures to prevent — and reduce — the problem. Take more exercise, and become more engaged with other people (picture posed by models) The first step is to try to understand the causes of depression, and those that are more common in older age groups. People of any age can be depressed: by medical problems, by loneliness, by loss of the ability to get out and about, or by poverty. All these reasons are more common as age increases, so some part of the work to help people feel less depressed rests not with the treatment of depression but with effective treatment of medical problems. For example, a hip replacement will be much more effective than anti-depressants for someone who is housebound, lonely and unable to sleep because of pain due to arthritis of the hip joint. Of course, for some people loneliness is a consequence of the loss of a partner and the effects of bereavement are still underestimated by those who have not experienced the devastating effects of the loss of a partner or, particularly distressing, a child. The Charity CRUSE does wonderful work in this area. Visit cruse.org.uk to find out what counselling and support services are available in your area or call their national helpline: 0844 477 9400. The problem of poverty is less easy to tackle because it is rooted in the inequalities that persist in almost every society. Every month people are advised to work longer to build up their pension pot, but this is little comfort to people who are already retired or who are not allowed to work past a fixed age. But attitudes are changing — there are now more than one million people aged 65 or older in the workforce — and many firms now actively seek to employ older people, often in jobs that the young can’t be bothered with. AgeUK has excellent advice on finding for work in older age. Just visit ageuk.org.uk and click on ‘work and learning’. LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE . Much of the negative image of old age stems from research that was badly designed — directly comparing people who are 70 or 80 with people who are 20. This is an unfair comparison, because of the advances of diet and healthcare, for example, that make today’s environment so much better for older people. It really is time to say ‘Goodbye to Growing Old’ (picture posed by models) In fact, when researchers follow people through life, the rate of decline and loss of function is much less today, and among the older generation many abilities actually improve. Evidence of this can be found in abundance in scientific journals at the National Library of Medicine near Washington DC — many of which can be accessed online. Put ‘healthy ageing’ or ‘healthy aging’ into the search box of nlm.nih.gov, where more than 23,000 scientific articles are presented. Just a few hours grazing through them can cheer you up no end! If some of it seems a bit technical, then I particularly recommend a recent book called Our Ageing Brain, by André Aleman, Professor of Neuropsychology at the University of Gronigen in the Netherlands, who clearly explains how wrong many of our assumptions have been about the workings of older brains. Here are some of the book’s key positive findings: . Wisdom can be defined as having insight into the major issues of life and the ability to make balanced decisions in uncertain situations. We become wiser thanks to the erosion of our mental faculties: the ageing brain works more slowly, and our responses are therefore more sensible. You may be ageing, then, but with the right attitude, there is so much to enjoy, to celebrate — and look forward to. You see? It really is time to say ‘Goodbye to Growing Old’. As we grow older, many of us find our mood sinking as we spend more time reflecting on and regretting the past and on worrying about the future. One way to achieve a happier and more positive outlook, then, is to spend more time focusing on the present. This is called ‘Mindfulness’ and is a series of exercises that will help you live more ‘in the moment’ and think more about the present. A doctor will sometimes now refer a person who is depressed to a mindfulness group or to some other form of cognitive or psychological therapy instead of prescribing a drug. One of the strengths of mindfulness is that you can do it by yourself at home, without a psychologist in the room, with the help of one of the CDs which are available, for example, The Mindful Way Workbook by John Teasdale, Mark Williams and Zindel Segal. For some people it might be better to start in a supervised group — look for adverts or posters of groups starting in your area. But here is a simple exercise you can practise at home.

"Conor McColl, 16, drowned in a disused quarry in Clophill, Bedfordshire, after swimming over to meet girls on the other bank, after earlier smoking cannabis, and inquest has ruled . A teenage boy drowned in a water-filled quarry after swimming over to meet girls on the other bank after earlier smoking cannabis with friends, an inquest heard today. Conor McColl and his friends had seen videos of the disused quarry in Clophill, Bedfordshire, on social media and decided to visit it because there was an island in the middle you could leap from into the water. A post mortem confirmed that Conor had drowned and revealed the 16-year-old, of Broadway, in Jaywick, Clacton-on-Sea, had been smoking cannabis at the quarry before his death in July last year. When Conor and his three friends arrived they found another eight teenagers already there, swimming and socialising, the inquest heard. After a couple of girls swam across the lake Conor and two of his friends followed them. Detective Sergeant Albert Freer read out statements from Conor's friends, Vaidas Nartautas, 16, Thomas Robertson, 21, and Reece Campbell, 17, at the inquest. The detective said that Vaidas had told him that when he reached the other side he spotted his friend, Conor, struggling in the water. Det Sgt Freer said: 'He was still in deep water when they both heard Conor start to struggle, saying he couldn't breathe and splash in the water. 'Vaidas swam out and tried to hold Conor up in the water but Conor started to struggle and was pulling him down. 'Vaidas lost all his strength. As Conor went down for the last time he gripped Vaidas' leg. Vaidas thought he was going to drown.' Vaidas tried to help Conor, the inquest heard, but his friend dropped below the surface and disappeared, sparking a frantic search by emergency services. Police divers from Nottingham later pulled Conor's body from the tangled weeds five metres beneath the surface in the gravel pit in Jaques Lane. Conor and three of his friends went swimming at the disused quarry, above, after seeing videos of it online . The inquest heard that Conor's friends and made 'heroic efforts' to try and save him before he went under . Det. Sgt. Freer told the inquest that the lock on the quarry's gate had been forced but said there was no evidence it had been broken by Conor and his friends. He said the quarry featured warning signs and was fenced off. Recording a verdict of misadventure, senior coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton Tom Osborne, described Conor's death as a tragic accident and said he hoped it would stop other youngsters from swimming in disused quarries. He said: 'He embarked upon the innocent past time of going swimming but it went horribly wrong. 'Conor entered the water and got into difficulty and depsite the heroic efforts of his friends to try to save him, he went under the water. 'It is particularly tragic. What seemed a frivilous past-time of going swimming in these lakes ended up in his tragic death.' Mr Osborne said the deaths of youngsters in deep water were an all-too-common occurance and warned of the dangers of going swimming in freezing cold lakes, even in summer. 'Even in the height of summer these pools remain extremely cold. They should be avoided at all costs,' he said. 'It's a highly dangerous past-time.' 'The message that should go out from this inquest is do not go swimming in cold water, even in the middle of summer.'","Conor McColl saw videos of the disused quarry in Bedfordshire online .

"These mysterious documents are written in the secret code of Italy's feared 'Ndrangheta. For years the organised crime syndicate from Calabria, in Italy's deep south, has fought rivals and police for control of the drugs trade in Rome. But yesterday law enforcement struck a powerful blow against the group, arresting 26 suspected members and seizing more than half a ton of cocaine and cannabis - as well as these notebooks. Scroll down for video . Cipher: This invaluable document has allowed Italian police to decrypt the secret code of the 'Ndrangheta . Most importantly, included with the encrypted documents was a cipher, which explains how each of the hieroglyphics of the so-called San Luca Code correspondents to letters of the Latin alphabet. Now police have been able to decipher the notebook, revealing what they described as 'the archaic procedural mechanisms regulating the ""initiation rite"" of the 'Ndrangheta,' according to a statement seen by the Ghana News Agency. Elsewhere the documents are said to outline the founding myth of Italy's mafia gangs. The 'Ndrangheta believes itself descended from one of three Spanish knights who saved the honour of their sister by killing a man, but were banished for their crime to the Sicilian island of Favignana. There they wrote the first code of conduct and formulated the law of 'omertà' - the code of silence - before splitting up to form secret societies. One went to Sicily where he formed the Cosa Nostra; another went to Naples where he formed the Camorra; the third went to Calabria where he formed the 'Ndrangheta. 'Good evening wise companions': The left-hand page contains a message about the initiation rites of the mafia gang. Other parts of the document are said to include details of the creation myth of Italy's mafia gangs . 'A beautiful morning of Holy Saturday...' begins this passage from the so-called San Luca code - named after the stronghold of the 'Ndrangheta in Calabria. Its messages are heavy with esoteric symbolism . With Italian businesses struggling to survive six years of on-off recession, mafia groups have found fertile ground to launder their criminal proceeds in Rome and other parts of Italy not normally associated with organised crime. 'The 'Ndrangheta considers Rome an integral part of its criminal project. Some members have said: ""Rome is the future"",' anti-mafia magistrate Michele Prestipino said. 'The Rome marketplace is strategic and helps the clans accumulate criminal and economic power.' Over the past two decades, police and prosecutors have dealt severe blows to the Sicilian Mafia, for decades Italy's most powerful criminal group. But at the same time, on the southern tip of the Italian mainland, the 'Ndrangheta has grown in strength by becoming one of Europe's biggest cocaine importers. On top of the 1,300lb of drugs seized, police said they had documented the trafficking of another 3,300lb of coke and hashish, Reuters reported. Hieroglyphics: The documents and cipher were seized in a raid in Rome yesterday, when police swooped on 26 members of the 'Ndrangheta and discovered more than half a ton of cocaine and cannabis . To extend its reach over the city's drug market, the 'Ndrangheta formed a hit squad to shoot dead a rival mob boss two years ago, police said. When the alleged assassins were tracked down last year, one of them turned state's evidence and provided information vital to Tuesday's arrests, Mr Prestipino said. The group had logistical bases in Genoa, Milan and Turin, and sent representatives to liaise with the most violent Colombian cocaine cartels, Finance Police Commander Cosimo Di Gesu said. Of the 31 wanted suspects, four others were detained in Spain, and only one was still at large. The gang's ambition was to 'monopolise the Roman drug market, establishing itself as the broker for the other criminal groups operating in the same territory', police said. Mr Prestipino said there were no direct links between this mafia group and one run by a former right-wing extremist who was arrested at the end of last year for masterminding a kickback scheme to manipulate Rome's city government.","Coded book and cipher seized in major drugs raid in Rome yesterday .

"One of the victims of the Asiana Airlines crash left a poignant final message on her microblogging account before she joined her classmates on Flight 214 to San Francisco. Wang Linjia, 16, was among a group of injured passengers who were not found by rescuers until 14 minutes after the crash nine days ago. Her final online posting read: 'Give yourself some affirmation, you're stronger than you . think. It's only called youth because it's painful.

Tragic: Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, are two of the three Chinese students killed the crash landing . The three schoolgirls who died following the crash have been described as star students by those back home in Zhejiang province in eastern China. They were on their way to a Christian summer camp in California where they planned to practice their English and improve their chances of getting into an American college. Wang, described by neighbours as quiet, courteous and hardwarking, excelled in physics and calligraphy. Her father proudly displayed her calligraphy and artwork on his office walls, AP reports. Confident and popular, she worked as a student reporter and served as a class monitor for three years. Liu Yipeng, 15, died on Friday after six days in intensive care . Wang and her close friend Ye Mengyuan, also 16, died on the day of the crash at San Francisco International Airport. The girls had been 'inseparable' since middle school, with photographs posted online showing them smiling and mugging for the camera while dressed in their school tracksuits. Ye was a champion . athlete who excelled at literature, playing the piano, singing and . public speaking. She had recently won a national aerobics competition, local media said, and routinely received honors at the school's annual speech contests. After her death, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV released footage showing Ye playing the piano at an event earlier this year. Her given name means 'wish come true' in Chinese. Ye had been badly injured in the . crash and was lying on the runway when she was hit by a fire truck on its way to help rescue efforts. She was hidden under flame-retardant foam that had been sprayed over the runway. It is not yet clear if Ye survived the crash and died from her injuries from being hit by the fire truck. The third victim Liu Yipeng, 15, died on Friday after six days in intensive care. She was rescued from her seat on the Boeing 777 jetliner and was hospitalized with severe head and abdominal injuries. She has been described as a standout student in math, physics and essay writing as well as a fan of video games. Friends have posted pictures of her holding a microphone and speaking to camera on the school's television station.

Their parents were flown to San Francisco after their deaths where the Chinese consulate was caring for them. The crash-landing occurred after the airliner collided with a rocky seawall just short of the runway. Dozens of passengers were hurt. There were 182 survivors taken to hospitals, though most suffered only minor injuries. So . far, an investigation indicates the pilots, a trainee and his . instructor, failed to realize until too late that the aircraft was . dangerously low and flying too slow. Asiana Airlines said today that it would enhance training for pilots seeking to convert to flying new aircraft, part of a series of measures it is undertaking after the fatal crash of an Boeing 777 plane in San Francisco. Miracle: Despite the cabin bursting into flames, only three people have so far been identified as dead . Nothing . disclosed so far by the National Transportation Safety Board . investigators indicates any problems with the Boeing 777's engines, . computers or automated systems. The pilot in charge of landing the plane was in training on the 777, while seated next to him was a co-pilot on his first flight as an instructor. Both were experienced pilots, although they had not flown together before, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said. Currently Asiana pilots have to fly 10 flights and a total of 60 hours on a 777 to complete its training programme. Pilot Lee Kang-kuk, a veteran who had nearly 10,000 hours of total flying experience, had completed eight flights and 43 hours on the Boeing 777, a spokesman said. He had flown Airbus planes before switching to the Boeing 777. The new measures will include enhancing training for visual approach and automated flight and conducting flight inspection on airports which are 'vulnerable to safety.' Panic: As fire trucks rushed to the scene, one may have hit and killed Liu Yipeng, 15, in the chaotic aftermath . The pilots aboard the Boeing 777 made a visual approach to San Francisco airport, and relied on automatic equipment to maintain airspeed. Asiana said it will also seek to improve communications skills among crew members, and introduce a system to manage 'fatigue risk.' Other measures include setting up separate maintenance teams for Boeing and Airbus planes, and enhancing safety management systems. Meanwhile, the carrier said on Monday that it planned to sue U.S. television station KTVU for reporting racially offensive fake names for the pilots of the Asiana flight. 'The KTVU report that not only disparaged Asians in general through the use of racially charged epithets, but also severely damaged the reputation of Asiana Airlines,' it said.","Three Chinese victims attended the same school in Zhejiang province .

"Sue Prickett, 78, was out walking her terrier Suki (together above) in Sherborne, Dorset, when the dog ran off and became trapped down a badger sett . A dog which became trapped down a hole for eight hours was eventually saved after 20 volunteers came to its rescue following a desperate appeal on Facebook. Sue Prickett, 78, was out walking her terrier Suki in Sherborne, Dorset, when the dog ran off and became trapped down a badger sett. Ms Prickett desperately tried to free Suki, along with the help of passer-by Shaun Summerbell, who came to her aid when he noticed her in a distressed state. However, their attempts to free the animal with a spade failed, and Mr Summerbell phoned his wife Julie for help. She quickly posted a message on Facebook asking for people to go and help with the rescue operation. Within 30 minutes of her status update, about 20 people had turned up at the scene, armed with torches, spades and pick axes. One person even took a powerful light on a tripod. The volunteers, who included some off-duty firemen, spent about four hours digging a four-foot deep trench to free the frightened pet. After eventually being released, Suki was handed back to her relieved owner who described the rescue as 'an example of the Great British public really being great.' She said: 'I have been past the hole before and my little dog has never attempted to go in. 'I don't know why she went down this time but she did. 'She came out backwards and I tried to get hold of her legs but she yelped and went back in further. 'I was just hanging around for about an hour hoping she would come out. 'Suki kept crying and whimpering, she's normally a very quiet dog. It was quite frightening because I felt so helpless.' Ms Prickett said she had been out walking both Suki, and her friend's labradoodle Rosie, when the incident occurred. After initial attempts to free her dog failed, she returned home to try and call the RSPCA for help, but she said they told her rescuers couldn't help because it was dark. She added: 'I had to get back because my friend was expecting her dog back and I don't have a mobile phone but I was so worried about leaving her there. After initial attempts to free Suki by Ms Prickett failed, an army of 20 volunteers arrived at the scene thanks to a Facebook plea from a passer-by's wife. The helpers dug a trench (left) to free Suki (right) from the deep hole . The volunteers, including some off-duty firemen, spent about four hours digging a four-foot deep trench to free the frightened pet. Suki was eventually rescued from the hole and returned, rather muddy, to her owner . Ms Prickett, 78, described the rescue as 'an example of the Great British public really being great' and said one person even came out dressed in a giraffe-print onesie to help with the rescue in Sherborne, Dorset . 'When I got home I tried calling people who could help - the vet, some firemen who don't live far from me, and the RSPCA but they said they couldn't come out in the dark. 'I went back to the field and just didn't know what to do. Then this very kind gentleman came past with his dog. 'He called someone and very quickly an enormous amount of people came out of the woodwork. One girl even came out in a giraffe-print onesie. 'Somebody brought a tripod with a light on it and suddenly there were torches, spades and pick axes. Two of the men were off-duty firemen and were very helpful. 'They were digging around where they thought she was and they literally sort of hand-dug her out. 'It was about four foot deep and when she came out her fur was covered in beads of rolled up mud. 'It took me ages to wash it all out and she shook mud all over the bathroom, but I'm so relieved to have her back. Ms Prickett said it took her ages to get all of the mud off her beloved dog, who was uninjured in the ordeal . The pensioner said: 'Suki is very special to me and I am extremely grateful to all those people who helped' 'I don't have the internet and Twitter and these things are all alien to me but it just goes to show you the power of social media. 'It's an example of the Great British public really being great. 'Suki is very special to me and I am extremely grateful to all those people.' Mrs Summerbell, a 50-year-old school dinner lady, said she put out a plea for volunteers on Facebook after her husband - a managing director of a company which designs and produces baby products – phoned for help. She said: 'My husband rang me and asked me to bring him a spade to the field which is about a mile away. 'After an hour he called again and said could I try to get some muscle power up there because he couldn't do it on his own. 'I didn't know what to do so I asked people to help on my Facebook status and it worked, within half-an-hour 20 people had turned up there. 'They had to dig a very big hole, it was about four foot down and four foot across.'","Suki the terrier became trapped in badger sett for eight hours on dog walk .

"Malcolm-Jamal Warner said it was 'painful' to watch Cosby face sexual allegations . Bill Cosby's onscreen son, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, has opened up about the sexual assault allegations mounting against his former co-star, saying it was 'painful' to watch. Warner, 44, was being interviewed by Billboard on Wednesday following his Grammy nomination for his work on Robert Glasper's Black Radio 2 album. The musician and actor, who played Cosby's son Theo Huxtable in the sitcom from 1984-1992, said it was difficult to watch Cosby face allegations 'just as it's painful to hear any woman talk about sexual assault, whether true or not'. Warner didn't directly address the allegations made by at least 15 women, citing a lack of first-hand knowledge. However, he added: ''The Bill Cosby I know has been great to me and great for a lot of people. What he's done for comedy and television has been legendary and history-making. 'What he's done for the black community and education has been invaluable. That's the Bill Cosby I know.' Warner and his mentor Cosby were believed to be close after the comedian wrote the role of Theo Huxtable based on own son Ennis - even incorporating real-life conversations the father and son had into the script. Ennis Cosby, the TV star's only son with whom Warner was also friendly, was shot dead in a car-jacking in LA in 1997. Cosby, 77, has not been charged with a crime and through his attorney has denied allegations, some of them dating back decades, that he drugged and assaulted women. Warner's cautious remarks came soon after a fellow TV star, and former producer of one of Cosby's TV shows, said that the allegations made against Cosby were true. Alan Thicke, who starred in Growing Pains and was a producer on Cosby's variety show Cos back in the 70s, said in a recent interview with the Toronto Star: 'There is no doubt in my mind Bill Cosby was a bad boy.' Bill Cosby receives an award alongside Malcolm-Jamal Warner and fellow Cosby cast member, Phylicia Rashad, and comedian Jerry Seinfeld . That being said, Thicke was also quick to point out that he never once witnessed any of this behavior from Cosby. 'In my history with Bill, I saw absolutely nothing of the controversy around him now,' said Thicke.'I just saw a guy who was doing his job.' Cosby is continuing his North American stand-up tour, seemingly oblivious to the protesters who were gathering outside his shows. Several promoters and venues have canceled performances amid dwindling ticket sales. NBC also said earlier this month that they would not be moving forward with a previously announced show featuring the actor. 'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of,' said NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt. He also said it was 'safe to say' the network would never again work with Cosby in any capacity. In other recent developments, Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer announced last week that he had evidence the actor was in New York City on the night model Chloe Goins accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her at the Playboy Mansion. Goins, who claims she was attacked by Cosby in 2008, is the first woman to come forward whose allegations did not fall outside the statue of limitations.

"There is a delicious type of miniature pancake, the recipe for which dates back to the 16th century, that tourists are offered in the Netherlands. They are called poffertjes and are quite unlike our thin, abstemious Shrove Tuesday version. Looking like puffed-up feather pillows, they are dusted with sugar, glazed with melted butter and drizzled with syrup. On particularly cold days, a measure of brandy might find its way into the batter. These culinary delights were undoubtedly much loved by those generously proportioned women painted by the great Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens — with their creased and creamy flesh, bosoms pulled in and pushed up by corsets, their plump elbows and, above all, their soft, eiderdown bottoms. The fact is that Rubens was not rebelling against a 17th-century Size Six ideal to champion the ‘larger lady’. Back then, there was no Size Six ideal; pictured above is his work, Venus at the Mirror . Indeed, the word ‘Rubenesque’ has come to be used to describe any woman of a certain size and softness. The comedian Dawn French has, self-deprecatingly, joked: ‘If I had been around when Rubens was painting, I would have been revered as a fabulous model. Kate Moss? She’d have been the paintbrush.’ It’s a good line, but it is to misunderstand Rubens if he is seen today as a man who encouraged women to embrace their curves, learn to love their jiggly bits and never say no to a second poffertje. The fact is that Rubens was not rebelling against a 17th-century Size Six ideal to champion the ‘larger lady’. Back then, there was no Size Six ideal. What Rubens revelled in was sheer abundance. He was attracted by wealth, titles, courtly grace, sumptuous fabrics, bounty, beauty, palaces, friends in high places, travel, fountains, sweeping lawns, manicured gardens and banqueting houses. As you can see at a new exhibition, Rubens And His Legacy, at the Royal Academy in London, his enthusiasm for delicious, wantonly plump female flesh was part of this taste for luxury and plenty. Born in 1577 into an affluent, respected family — his father was a lawyer — and brought up in Antwerp, Rubens was appointed a page to a noblewoman, Marguerite de Lalaing d’Arenberg, Comtesse de Ligne, after finishing his schooling. This early association with courtly manners helped to make him a hit with aristocratic and royal patrons after he trained as a painter. Rubens, who served not only as a court painter but also as a diplomat, was dubbed ‘the prince of painters and painter of princes’; still, he is best remembered for his plump and inviting nudes . His client list reads like a who’s who of European society: counts, dukes and archdukes, earls and knights, King Philip IV of Spain and our own King Charles I. Rubens, who served not only as a court painter but also as a diplomat, was dubbed ‘the prince of painters and painter of princes’. Still, he is best remembered for his plump and inviting nudes. We cannot blame the poffertjes alone, for the Low Countries at that time were truly a place of guzzling and gluttony. One historian remarked in 1665 that the land ‘overflows with butter, cheese and milk’. They weren’t the half of it. Sugar arrived on ships from Brazil. Traditional waffles and pancakes, once served plain, were now dusted with sugar and caramelised sauces. Cakes and biscuits were studded with candied fruit, crystallised ginger or molasses. Almond tarts and rosewater flavoured marzipan were served on special occasions. Honey cakes and caramel were daily treats. There were dessert creams made with milk, sugar, cinnamon, eggs, and apples. One chronicler lists 41 types of biscuit, from those made with aniseed to others baked with cherries. Marrons glacés (sugared chestnuts) were imported from France. Whenever gluttons felt sated, they tucked into salads of imported fruits — the rich could afford pineapples, while middle-class burghers made do with melons, oranges and grapes. Any pretence at virtue, however, was undone by a tendency to cover the grapes in treacle. Reubens painting the Massacre Of The Innocents; . Tooth decay was a terrible problem. The artist Rembrandt van Rijn, who saw the older Rubens as his great rival, lost almost all his teeth in later life because of his weakness for sugar. There was even a word for it: lekkerheid — a craving for sweetness or tastiness. A typical day would begin with breakfast — the first of four meals — and it might include three types of bread (a rye loaf, a wheaten one and a sweeter pastry baked with fruits and sugared spices) and five types of cheese. Two varieties of butter would be served along with fish, sliced and salted ox or pork, buttermilk, hot chocolate, tea, and the leftovers of the previous night’s dinner. The wealthiest in society might have had a game or meat pie if they were still feeling peckish. In summer, cherries and berries would be eaten with sweet or sour cream. Everyone drank beer at breakfast — it was thought the most wholesome drink for men, women and children and consumed in vast quantities throughout the day. Lunch was a four-course affair. A soup to start, usually made from vegetables and bacon cooked in milk. For main, a meat or fish dish with salad or fruit to follow. Then pudding proper: waffles, the inevitable pancakes or rice pudding. At 3pm there was bread, cheese, almonds, raisins, a selection of pastries, tea and hot or cold beer. Dinner — even gourmands might begin to groan at this point — was much the same as lunch, with butter, bread, cheese, wine sweetened with cinnamon and sugar, and a milky porridge. One hugely popular dish, sometimes called olipotrigo but given different names across the Low Countries, was a hotpot made with slow-cooked capon, lamb, minced veal, rams’ testicles, beef, calves’ heads, coxcombs, sausage, marrowbone, artichokes, chicory, endive, asparagus and game birds, mixed with four or five egg yolks, wine, vinegar and melted butter, served with roasted chestnuts. Is it any wonder the English botanist and parson John Ray, who travelled in the Low Countries in the 17th century, wrote that men and women he encountered were ‘almost always eating as they travel, whether by boat, coach or wagon’ and that they were ‘for the most part big-boned and gross-bodied’? For his part, Rubens looked on his countrywomen with a more sympathetic eye than Parson Ray. A note on the wall at the Royal Academy exhibition reads: ‘Rubens enjoyed painting buxom nudes.’ This is extreme understatement. No artist painted poffertjes-plumped flesh with the sensuous joy of Rubens. In his double-portrait of the amorous god Pan and the chaste nymph Syrinx (included in the exhibition), he paints an inch-wide crease above Syrinx’s navel. Just enough to be pinched between thumb and forefinger. You can see why the satyr Pan might want to get his hands on this buttermilk-and-beer-fed maiden. Reubens paiting, Cain Slaying Abel above; Reubens And His Legacy is at the Royal Academy from this Saturday until April 10 . The art historian Kenneth Clark, presenter of the sweeping BBC series Civilisation, most elegantly took the measure of Rubens when he wrote in his 1956 book The Nude: ‘Why do we burn with indignation when we hear people who believe themselves to have good taste dismissing Rubens as a painter of fat naked women, and even applying the epithet vulgar? What is it, in addition to sheer pictorial skill, that makes his nudes noble and life-giving creations?’ His answer is simple: ‘The golden hair and swelling bosoms of his Graces are hymns of thanksgiving for abundance, and they are placed before us with the same unselfconscious piety as the sheaves of corn and piled-up pumpkins which decorate a village church at Harvest Festival.’ ‘Hymns of thanksgiving for abundance’ — that is what you must think when you see Rubens’ women with their dimpled thighs, the soft, soufflé folds of their stomachs and their yielding flesh. The last painting in the exhibition is Rubens’ Venus Frigida. A doleful Venus sits hunched and hungry. Her son, Cupid, cowers with neither the will nor energy to pick up his bow and arrow to make his customary mischief. Behind them, a satyr approaches, carrying a cornucopia of wheat and fruit. It was inspired by a line from the Roman playwright Terence: ‘Love withers without food and drink.’ You might say the same about Rubens’ voluptuous and unrepentantly indulgent art. * Rubens And His Legacy is at the Royal Academy from this Saturday until April 10.

"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (pictured) indirectly but 'unlawfully discriminated' against gipsies, the High Court has ruled . Communities Secretary Eric Pickles 'unlawfully discriminated' against gipsies by using his ministerial powers to personally decide whether they should be allowed to settle on green belt land, the High Court has ruled. In a ruling likely to affect many other travellers, a judge found both human rights and equality laws were breached by Mr Pickles and his department for 'calling in' cases which would normally be considered by his planning inspectors. Mr Justice Gilbart, sitting in London, said Mr Pickles was operating a legally flawed policy of 'recovering' for his own consideration appeals by travellers who claim there are exceptional circumstances for allowing them Green Belt sites. The judge said an inspectors' decision was normally received within eight weeks of the end of an inquiry - but it could take six months or more for a decision letter for a called-in case. No attempt had been made by Mr Pickles and his ministers to follow steps required by the 2010 Equality Act to avoid indirect discrimination, and 'substantial delays' had occurred in dealing with the appeals in violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, said the judge. His test-case ruling was a victory for two Romany gipsies- Charmaine Moore, a single mother with three children who is under threat of eviction from a site at North Cudham in the London borough of Bromley, and Sarah Coates, a disabled woman also with three children fighting to live temporarily on Green Belt land at Sutton-at-Hone near Dartford, Kent. Both women wanted to live with their children in caravans on their own green belt land but were refused planning permission by their local councils. Their subsequent appeals were automatically referred to Mr Pickles under the 2013 'calling in' policy, which meant any appeals over planning decisions relating to traveller sites in the green belt were automatically referred to the Secretary of State. The judge found  Mr Pickles had breached the Equality Act 2010 by indirectly discriminating against gipsies and travellers through this policy. Travellers on a sports field in  Staffordshire. Gipsy and traveller leaders have condemned Mr Pickles' 'calling in' policy which they argue enabled him to overturn recommendations to allow site planning appeals . The judge said Mr Pickles' department had 'coined and developed' a practice in 2013-2014 of calling in all, and then a majority, of Green Belt traveller cases - most involving Romany gypsies or Irish travellers - 'which discriminated unlawfully against a racial group'. He was also found to have breached Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights by delaying the women's right to justice. He ruled that the Moore and Coates cases were two such 'unlawful recoveries' and quashed them. Planning Minister Brandon Lewis (pictured) said: 'This Government makes no apologies for seeking to safeguard Green Belt protection and trying to bring a sense of fair play to the planning system' Planning Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'This Government makes no apologies for seeking to safeguard Green Belt protection and trying to bring a sense of fair play to the planning system. 'The Government's planning policy is clear that both temporary and permanent traveller sites are inappropriate development in the Green Belt. Today's judgment does not question that principle.' But the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which supported the gipsies challenge after becoming concerned that the 'call in' policy may be unfair, welcomed the judge's finding of indirect discrimination. An EHRC spokesman said: 'We have a duty to protect everyone from discrimination and ensure that the law is applied fairly, consistently and equally for all. 'We understand the need to be sensitive about Green Belt development but this should not be used to single out individuals for unlawful discrimination. 'Planning decisions should be taken on the merits of an application, not the characteristics of the applicant.' Gipsy and traveller leaders have condemned Mr Pickles' policy which, they argue, has enabled him to predominantly overturn recommendations to allow site planning appeals. They say local councils have consistently failed to earmark land for potential sites in local plans, and many gipsy travellers have bought land, including in the Green Belt, to develop sites for themselves. The Community Law Partnership, which brought the case on behalf of the two women, told The Independent the implications of the judgement were 'enormous' and that around 100 gipsy and traveller planning appeals which were overseen personally by Mr Pickles since July 2013 could now be challenged in the courts.","Mr Justice Gilbart said both human rights and equality laws were breached .

"The spies will wear disguises while giving evidence at the trial of Abid Naseer, who is accused of being behind a failed plot to bomb two Manchester shopping centres . British spies are to be allowed to don wigs and make-up in an attempt to conceal their identity during a trial of an alleged Al Qaeda operative, a judge ruled. The six MI5 agents will wear disguises when they give evidence at the US trial of Abid Naseer, who is accused of being involved in an international conspiracy, targeting Manchester and New York. US District Judge Raymond Dearie approved the unusual request in Brooklyn on Wednesday, after prosecutors explained the agents are still working undercover on sensitive cases,  arguing revealing their identities would 'pose a significant risk to their safety'. The six undercover operatives were part of a team which conducted surveillance on Naseer, 28, while investigating a failed plot to bomb Manchester's Arndale and Trafford shopping centres in 2009. They are all due to give evidence at the trial next month, and will be referred to by number rather than names. The agents are also allowed to wear wigs and 'light make-up', as, papers filed by the prosecution said, 'neither of which will impair the defendant's or the jury's ability to view the witnesses' facial expressions and assess their credibility and demeanor'. Naseer, a Pakistani national who came to the UK on a student visa, was extradited from the UK to New York in 2013, after a High Court judge ruled he 'poses a serious threat to the national security of the UK'. Two other witnesses expected to testify against Naseer — Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay — pleaded guilty in the thwarted plot to detonate homemade explosives in the subways. Prosecutors claim email show all three men were under the direction of the same Al Qaeda handler. They also say documents recovered during the bin Laden raid — now declassified — confirm the terror network's leadership was behind the conspiracy. Naseer has decided to serve as his own attorney at the trial, expected to begin in the middle of February.

"Four men were today charged with helping the terrorist responsible for the murders of four Jews and a policewoman in Paris, as the French Prime Minister revealed there are 3,000 people with ties to France being monitored by anti-terror officers. Three face prison for supplying weapons and other equipment to self-styled IS ‘warrior’ Amedy Coulibaly, who was himself also gunned down earlier this month. It apparently confirms that the 32-year-old Parisian was part of a large cell committed to bringing death and destruction to the capital in the name of radical Islam. Scroll down for video . Three face prison for supplying weapons and other equipment to self-styled IS ‘warrior’ Amedy Coulibaly . This photograph of the inside of gunman Amedy Coulibaly's flat reveals dynamite, guns and tear gas . Those charged have not been named, but are believed to be from the Paris suburbs, and aged 22, 25, 26 and 28. Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins did not give the suspects' full identities, naming them only as Willy P, Christophe R, Tonino G and Mickael A. Molins said ‘three of the individuals were placed in provisional detention overnight’ while legal argument over the fourth’s status continues. All are accused of aiding and abetting terrorism. The first three men were arrested during police raids last Friday, exactly a week after Coulibaly died. The DNA of Mickael A. was found on a revolver in Coulibaly's apartment and on a glove the gunman wore in the supermarket. Molins also said Mickael A had 18 phone contacts with Coulibaly on January 6. Molins said three of the men are believed to have procured weapons and tactical material for Coulibaly, but are not charged with complicity in the attacks. The lawyer for one of those charged said his client was unaware of any terrorist plot and was afraid of Coulibaly. Lawyer Fabrice Delinde told BFM television said the gunman ""terrorized my client"" and intimidated him into helping. He would not identify his client, for his own security. Molins said authorities in France are working with other countries to search for other possible accomplices. They are especially trying to uncover who was responsible for the posthumous video of Coulibaly, which was edited and released days after he and brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi died in standoffs with police. In the video, Coulibaly pledges allegiance to the Islamic State group and details how the attacks were coordinated by the three men. Manuel Valls said the government will spend 425million euros (£325million) on counter-terrorism over three years in response to the attacks, which will include hiring an extra 2,600 counter-terrorism officers. France will also bolster its intelligence apparatus, introducing a measure to make it easier to tap phones, he said. In addition, 3,000 people with ties to France - some at home, others abroad, will be monitored by anti-terror surveillance agents. The number linked to jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq and increased by 130 per cent in one year, he said. Since three police were among those killed by the Paris terrorists, Valls said improving officers' weapons and protective gear was among the top priorities. Coulibaly had been working with the brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, 34 and 32, who carried out a massacre around the offices of the anti-Islamic Charlie Hebdo, which left 12 dead. They were also shot dead by police commandos following a siege similar to the one Coulibaly died in, at a Kosher store in eastern Paris. Three women arrested in the latest raids were freed on Saturday, while five other suspects were allowed home yesterday. New York city mayor Bill de Blasio laid a wreath of flowers on Tuesday at the kosher deli where Amedy Coulibaly killed four people in a terror attack . All of the terrorists had automatic rifles and other weaponry including a rocket launcher – prompting detailed investigations as to where they had come from. It came as Paris police confirmed they had questioned Coulibaly just 10 days before the worst terrorist attacks in France this century. He was driving a rental car on December 30, with his partner Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, in the passenger seat, when traffic officers pulled him over. Coulibaly, who just had a provisional driving license at the time, was listed on the police computer database as a ‘dangerous criminal’ with connections to radical Islam. The officers were advised to question the man without arousing his suspicion, according to the Canard Enchaine investigative weekly. He was not arrested, and nothing more came of the incident. The car was rented in the name of Boumeddiene, who is currently the most wanted female terrorist suspect in the world. She fled to Syria from Paris days before the attacks, and is currently thought to be with IS terrorist forces.","Four from Paris suburbs have been charged with helping Amedy Coulibaly .

"A trainee beautician who is blind in one eye had half of her ponytail hacked off after two boys ran up behind her and hacked at her ponytail with scissors. Emily Wilding, 17, from Northwich, Cheshire, was walking home along a main road at around 5pm after finishing work at a restaurant when the boys ran up behind her. One of them used a pair of scissors to hack at her hair, which was tied in a ponytail, before fleeing into a nearby park. Trainee beautician Emily Wilding, 17, who is also blind in one eye, was attacked as she walked home from her job at a restaurant in Northwich, Cheshire, by two boys who cut her hair with scissors . Mother Karen Wilding said: 'Emily came home and was panicking saying ""mum I think somebody has just cut my hair"" and I said ""don’t be silly"". 'But when I looked a huge chunk came away in my hand. She was devastated. Her hair means so much to her and she’s really conscious of the length of it. She’s always asking me to look at it. According to police Miss Wilding saw the boys, who were wearing hoodies, approach from behind before hearing a snipping sound as they passed her . 'I told her it could have been much worse though because she is blind in one eye already and if she had turned they could have had her other eye and she could have lost her sight completely. 'It has just completely knocked her confidence she’s been on a definite downer since it happened and she just doesn’t want to leave the house.

Emily lives just five minute's walk along main roads from her workplace in Northwich town centre, but this is not the first time she has been approached on her way home. Her mother added that just last year police were called after a man approached her and asked her to go with him, before also running away. Since the latest attack the family have been supported by the local community, with a local hairdresser giving her a free haircut and extensions. Police have appealed for anyone who might have witnessed the incident, which happened last Tuesday, or have information on the two attackers, to come forward. A spokesman for Cheshire Constabulary said: 'The victim was walking along Castle Street when two males approached her from behind. 'As they went past her she heard a snipping noise and later discovered that some of her hair had been cut out. According to Miss Wilding's mother the attack has left her daughter's confidence badly shattered, so she has been given free extensions and a haircut at a local beauty salon . 'One was described as wearing a grey tracksuit with white trainers, the other one was wearing a blue tracksuit with black trainers. 'Both men are white and under five foot tall, and had their hoods pulled up at the time of the attack.' Officers say there is no indication at this stage that Miss Wilding knew either of the attackers. Anyone with information is asked to contact Cheshire Constabulary on 101.","Emily Wilding, 17, was walking home when boys in hoodies approached .

"A hotel in Queensland has had their Gumtree job advertisement removed because it asked for full length photographs of applicants. Ravenswood Imperial Hotel in northern Queensland posted an advert on the classifieds website three weeks ago, prompting moderators to remove the ad. Pub owner John Schluter stands by the employing process, saying that the need for well-presented employees is the same in every industry. ‘We need to know they’re compatible for the pub. If the girls are 4’2 and they can’t see over the bar that obviously isn’t going to work’ he said. Ravenswood Imperial Hotel in northern Queensland posted an advert asking applicants to post full length photos three weeks ago, prompting website moderators to remove the ad . The ad sparked outcry on social media, where some have claimed it encourages discrimination . ‘It’s offbeat to the customers who have just worked 12 hour shifts if the employees are daggy or poorly dressed. We get people here from all over the world.’ While The Fair Work Act does not deny employees the right to ask for a photo, it is considered unlawful to discriminate against employees over their race, colour, sex, age, physical or mental disability or marital status. But Mr Schluter said this has been the hotels employment policy for some time. ‘We’ve been doing this for eight years, and I’m not sure why it’s an issue. We run a careful establishment here and I can’t have anyone looking unkempt,’ he said. ‘This is the real world,’ he said. ‘It’s not about discrimination; we have had plenty of ethnic employees, some of which speak limited English.

Miranda Hamilton wrote on Facebook: 'A photo before an interview provides an opportunity for discrimination on appearance not presentation.' Sinead Hagan wrote: ‘I think its rude to ask for a photo. It just give the employer the opportunity to make judgement without meeting you.’ However some Social Media users have supported the business owner, arguing that it is his right as an owner and being attractive is important in hospitality.

"A memorial to police chokehold victim Eric Garner was damaged by fire on the day which celebrates civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Garner's daughter Erica posted on her Twitter account that the site, which had candles and flowers remembering the 43-year-old Staten Island father, had been burnt down on Monday night. Police said  that 'candles under plexiglass' were the cause of the accidental fire, the New York Daily News reported. The memorial to Eric Garner was burnt down Monday night after a vigil to the late Staten Island father.  Above, the site was full of candles and flowers in early December, after a grand jury refused to indict the police officer that put the 43-year-old  in a chokehold . Twenty-four-year-old Erica posted Monday that she thought the fire had been set by 'evil people' and said the act was 'really sick'. She later said that she wasn't accusing anyone of setting the fire. Ms Garner called for an investigation into the incident and said the setback to the memorial 'only makes me stronger'. A fire department spokesman said the blaze was an accident. Thirty firefighters were able to close it out around 20 minutes after being called at 10:24pm Monday night, the Staten Island Advance reported. Eric Garner's death from a chokehold by NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo in July brought national attention to the relationship between police and black men. Erica Garner (right) visits the rebuilt memorial to her late father Mr Garner (left) whose death sparked national conversation about police brutality . Garner was  pinned to the ground by police in the incident captured on video, in which he can be heard repeatedly saying 'I can't breathe'. His death was ruled a homicide by the New York City medical examiner. A subsequent non-indictment of Pantaleo by a Staten Island grand jury in December sparked a continuing series of protests against alleged police racism. The jury's decision followed on another controversial non-indictment of a white officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. The memorial to Garner, next to where he was confronted by police for selling loose cigarettes, is being rebuilt by his daughter. A sign placed on the site Tuesday says, 'They burnt it down but will never wash the blood spilled.'' Erica Garner has also been involved in leading protests against police brutality under the slogan 'Black Lives Matter'. Erica Garner (centre) led a candle-lit vigil at the site of her father's memorial several hours before it was burnt down . She held a vigil of about 100 people with Rev Al Sharpton to honor her father on a day remembering a leader in African-American rights. Monday's holiday, which falls near the Nobel Peace Prize-winner's birthday, saw protests in numerous US cities repeating Dr King's call for racial equality, including a march of more than 1,000 people in New York. A petition for President Barack Obama to invite Eric Garner's family to the State of the Union address gathered more than 49,000 signatures, though the relatives were ultimately did not attend Congress to see the speech.

"The family of a legally blind inmate who died after falling down a flight of stairs outside Manhattan Criminal Court is suing New York City. Apolinar Solis, 51, fell as he was being taken from a holding pen outside a courtroom to an NYC Department of Correction pen in November 2013. The Harlem resident fractured his skull and was taken to New York Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan Hospital for surgery. Apolinar Solis (left) fell outside Manhattan Criminal Court (right) as he was being taken from a courtroom holding pen to a Department of Correction pen . Solis, who remained conscious afterwards, died from brain swelling and a blood clot two days later. The family has now filed a suit in Manhattan Supreme Court which claims he should never have been allowed to climb the courthouse stairs. The suit, which was filed by Solis' daughter on behalf of his estate, alleges her father needed a wheelchair because of a large ulcer that had developed on his foot while he was in custody. He was blind in one eye, suffered from diabetes and needed regular dialysis for his kidneys. Solis had been arrested in October and was taken into custody because he couldn't make bail. He was held in an infirmary on Rikers Island before coming into the city to appear before a judge on charges of cocaine possession. According to the lawsuit, the emergency workers who treated Solis never applied ice to his head. 'Basic first aid was lacking,' the family's lawyer, Ilya Novofastovsky, told the New York Daily News. The suit, which charges New York City and Rikers health care provider Corzon Health Inc with malpractice, negligence and violating Solis’ civil rights, is seeking unspecified damages. 'The family is looking for answers,' Novofastovsky told Gothamist in 2013. 'What we're trying to get to is transparency from officials. 'The family wasn't even told he was in the hospital until somebody from the hospital tipped them off. 'Their loved one was manhandled and died, and they simply want an explanation and information about what his last moments were like.'

"Army families and MPs last night condemned ‘disgraceful incompetence’ and Establishment meddling for holding up the Iraq war inquiry. John Chilcot yesterday told David Cameron it will be ‘some further months’ before he can publish his report. Launched six years ago, Sir John’s inquiry is expected to criticise dozens of senior figures. Delay: Launched six years ago, Sir John Chilcot's inquiry is expected to criticise dozens of senior figures . The delay means voters will go to the polls in May without knowing the official verdict on one of Britain’s most disastrous military ventures. John Miller, whose 21-year-old son Simon died in a massacre near Basra in 2003, said the delay was disgraceful. ‘It is becoming the biggest cover-up of our generation,’ he said. ‘We simply can’t understand it.’ Tim Farron, a senior Lib Dem, said: ‘It’s about the Establishment protecting themselves.’ The country’s top civil servant, cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood, was also in the firing line for withholding key documents. In a personal attack, former foreign secretary Lord Owen said: ‘I have never known a cabinet secretary to have such a veto. Frustrating hold-up: Prime Minister David Cameron said  the report should have been published years ago . Former PM: Whitehall sources said dozens of the key players in the conflict, including Tony Blair (pictured meeting troops in Iraq in May 2003), are facing criticism in a document expected to run to a million words . ‘It seems to me that he hasn’t had that independence of mind that is necessary. I can only say I am worried about it.’ As Sir John faced calls to appear before MPs to explain the delays: . 'Cover-up': John Miller (with wife Marilyn), whose son Simon (in photo on wall), 21, died in a massacre near Basra in 2003, said the delay was disgraceful . The inquiry was set up by then prime minister Gordon Brown in 2009 and took public evidence from its last witness in 2011. But publication has been held up by wrangling over the release of confidential messages and the so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process by which people who are criticised in the report are given the chance to respond. In an exchange of letters yesterday, Sir John explained to Mr Cameron that he would not be able to report before the May 7 general election. His admission came against a backdrop of increasing Westminster anger over the delays, which were due to be addressed in a Commons debate next week. Personal: Cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood (left) was attacked for withholding key documents, with former foreign secretary Lord Owen (right) saying he had 'never known a cabinet secretary to have such a veto' At Prime Minister’s Questions, the Father of the House, Conservative MP Sir Peter Tapsell, attacked the Chilcot inquiry’s ‘disgraceful incompetence’. Sir Peter asked Mr Cameron: ‘Do you fully recognise the contrast in efficiency between the inquiries into the Crimean war and the Dardanelles campaign when compared to the disgraceful incompetence of the Chilcot inquiry into widely held suspicions that Mr Blair conspired with president George W Bush several months before March of 2003 and then systematically sought to falsify the evidence on which that action was taken?’ Mr Cameron said the hold-up was extremely frustrating and the report should have been published years ago. Mr Blair insisted he was not responsible for the delay, telling Bloomberg: ‘Absolutely and emphatically, this is not to do with me, or as far as I’m aware any other witness. ‘I’ve as much interest as anybody in wanting to see the report published.’ He is understood to have received the final documents from the inquiry only a few days ago. Sir Richard Ottaway, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said there could be ‘no justification whatsoever’ for the process dragging on. He said Sir John had been summoned before his committee to explain. Here is an edited account of the exchange of letters between Sir John Chilcot and David Cameron: . SIR JOHN WROTE: . Dear Prime Minister, . I last wrote to you in November 2013, and to Sir Jeremy Heywood in May 2014, with an update on progress of the Iraq Inquiry. My colleagues and I have made very substantial progress since my last letter. I can confirm that individuals are currently being given the opportunity to respond to provisional criticism of them in the Inquiry’s draft report. That is an essential and confidential process. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on it in detail. We intend to finish our work as soon as it is possible to do so whilst being fair to all those involved. Until we have received and evaluated responses from all those who have been given the opportunity to respond, I cannot give an accurate estimate for how long it will then take to complete our work, but it is clear that will take some further months. I therefore see no realistic prospect of delivering our report to you before the General Election in May 2015. Our report will be based on a thorough and comprehensive account of the relevant events from 2001-2009. We are determined to fulfil the responsibility placed on us to identify lessons to be learned from the UK’s involvement in Iraq. In that context, I am pleased to record that since I last wrote the Inquiry has reached agreement with Sir Jeremy on the publication of 29 of Mr Blair’s Notes to President Bush, subject to a very small number of essential redaction, alongside the Inquiry’s final report. Agreement has also been reached on the detail of what material the Inquiry will publish in relation to records of conversations between Mr Blair and President Bush, consistent with the principles agreed last era. Yours sincerely, . Sir John Chilcot . MR CAMERON REPLIED: . Dear Sir John, . Thank you for your letter of today. As you know, I would have liked to have seen your report published already and certainly well before the forthcoming Election. The Iraq War, the lead up to it and its aftermath were hugely important events in this country’s recent history. It is very important that your Inquiry sets out comprehensively for the British people what happened, and why, so that all the lessons can be learnt. However, it is important that the Inquiry remains fully independent of Government and therefore the timetable and processes for completing your work are entirely for you to decide – not for the Government. So I have to respect your decision. I hope very much that you will be able to [submit the report] shortly thereafter. Had the previous Government established this Inquiry when I first called for it, we would not be in this position today. But that cannot now be undone. Yours, . David .","John Chilcot tells PM it will be 'months' before he can publish report .

"Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis, 42, (pictured) said he was subjected to a 'commuter rage' incident . Consumer champion Martin Lewis has revealed how he was the victim of ‘commuter rage’ on his way to work. The 42-year-old Money Saving Expert managed to incur the wrath of another man by texting on his mobile phone as he walked in the street. Multi-millionaire Lewis claims he was grabbed around the neck, shoved and verbally abused in an attack that left him ‘shaking with anger’. He says that the dispute began yesterday morning as he walked towards Waterloo station. Minutes after the incident, the TV presenter told his 211,000 Facebook followers how he was pushed to one side by a professionally dressed man in his 50s. Lewis wrote: 'While walking to Waterloo station entrance, to get the train for filming a man, and checking my phone - a 50ish, grey haired, heavy set, white man, professionally dressed, carrying a bag, shoved me aside. 'I said (not shouted) quite simply - ""the word is excuse me"". 'He turned around gripped me at the neck by my coat shoved me hard and said getting in my face ""don't text while you walk you t***, on your f****** phone you t***, you should get out of the f****** way'. 'I replied ""you've just assaulted me."" To which he said ""no I haven't I just called you a t***"". 'I then said again very deliberately without aggression or swearing back ""can you let me take a photo of you please so I can report you to the police"". 'He then hurried off round the corner down the steps to the tube - sadly before I could photograph him. 'Not pleasant at all. While I wasn't physically scared, I must admit to now be shaking with anger now that he got away with that type of behaviour. 'It's a very sad state of affairs people think this is acceptable behaviour.' Mr Lewis was in Waterloo Station (pictured) at around 9am after appearing on Good Morning Britain on ITV. He claims he was grabbed around the neck, shoved and verbally abused in an attack that left him ‘shaking' Mr Lewis with wife Lara Lewington at the 2013 Cartier Queens Cup Polo at Guards Polo Club in Berkshire . Lewis concluded: ‘While I wasn’t physically scared, I must admit to now be shaking with anger that he got away with that. It’s a very sad state of affairs people think this is acceptable behaviour.’ However, his retelling of the incident sparked a debate over the rapidly growing numbers who text in the street. While condemning the assault, many said they too found the practice irritating. One wrote on Facebook: ‘Although the way he [the attacker] reacted is totally out of order I can understand how annoyed he was, nothing worse than trying to get somewhere and getting stuck behind someone texting. 'Every time I try to pass texters they seem to have a sixth sense and wobble the way I am trying to go… You should be a little more considerate yourself… Still no reason to ruff [sic] you up though.’ Mike Fisher, director of the British Association of Anger Management, said: ‘Living in big cities like London is becoming more and more stressful and we all might get annoyed by people talking loudly on the phone, or being distracted while texting, but this should not be a reason to lash out. 'This should be a warning to that person to sort themselves out. This won’t be the first time they’ve experienced these feelings.’ The consumer expert said the dispute began as he walked towards Waterloo station while on his phone . Last night a spokesman for Lewis, who had been on his way to film his ITV programme The Martin Lewis Money Show, said he had not yet reported the incident to police. British Transport Police said: ‘We would encourage anyone who has been the victim of this sort of crime to come forward. We would always investigate an incident such as this.’ The spokesperson added that much of the area they are responsible for is covered by high quality CCTV cameras, so it is important that people report incidents quickly so the footage can be secured.","Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis was today accosted at Waterloo Station .

"In the 1980s, Jane Fonda was indisputably the aerobics queen. The Hollywood star released her first exercise video in 1982 and promptly sold 17 million copies - she has been widely credited for launching the fitness craze that spread across America and Britain in the Eighties. Jane, now 77, is celebrating more than 30 years in the business by publishing her entire back catalogue of VHS cassettes as DVDs and digital downloads. Scroll down for video . Jane Fonda is celebrating more than 30 years in the fitness business. She is publishing her entire back catalogue of VHS cassettes digitally. To celebrate FEMAIL looks at the change in workout videos from the 1950s . Jane's wholesome videos are a far cry from the celebrity workouts of the Noughties - where every half-popular soap actress, pop singer or reality star claims they'll be the one to make you thin. The wardrobe has also taken a drastic turn, from leotards, legwarmers and perms to sleek gym gear, spray tans and false lashes . But the changes are nothing compared to the very first aerobics programmes of the1950s. The Jack LaLanne Show of the Fifties was thought to be the very first exercise programme and featured Jack 'at home' taking the viewers through a workout - the series ran from 1953 to 1985. It was followed by The Debbie Drake Show - Debbie was the first woman to get her own exercise show in 1960 and continued in the role until 1978. The shift in the 1970s and 80s was towards skimpier clothing and group exercise in studio or beach settings. Then in the 1990s, the likes of Mr Motivator on GMTV made producers realise that there was money to be had from tying in celebrities and exercise. It resulted in the shedload of DVD's since 2000 that includes anyone from Z-listers to Hollywood stars. But in the last few years, another phenomenon has developed - with TV stars keen to get as many sales as possible of their workout films, they are being convinced to pose in unflattering swimwear or exercise clothes in a public place. Then around six months after the pictures are taken, the star miraculously drops the pounds and credits her new exercise video, which is available to buy in shops. Femail looks at some of the defining exercise videos of the last 65 years: . 1950s - The Jack LaLanne Show . Jack LaLanne presented fitness and exercise advice on television for 34 years, starting out as a 15-minute segment between two news programmes in 1953. He had the longest running fitness show on American television, with it lasting 34 years. 1950s - The Jack LaLanne Show . 1960s - The Debbie Drake Show . Debbie Drake was the first female to have her own exercise show when the first episode aired of the Debbie Drake Show in 1960. She went on to become a huge star, writing fitness books and recording albums including Look Good! Feel Great! and How to Keep Your Husband Happy. 1960s - The Debbie Drake Show . 1970s - Sit And Be Fit . When Mary-Ann Wilson started the show Sit And Be Fit, she could never have anticiapted how popular exercising on a chair could be on television. The idea was to make an aerobics class that would suit the elderly and people with limited mobility. 1970s - Sit And Be Fit . 1980s - Gilad's Bodies in Motion . Gilad's Bodies in Motion was one of the biggest exercise shows of the 1980s, alongside Jane Fonda's shows. It took the concept of group exercise and moved it to exotic locations like Waikiki Beach (pictured below.) Gilad continued to produce fitness programmes until four years ago . 1980s - Gilad's Bodies in Motion . 1990s - Mr Motivator . Fitness trainer Mr Motivator, real name Derrick Evans, first became a household name in 1993 after he was given a slot on ITV breakfast show GMTV. At the time, he was still calling himself by his real name, but after TV star Judy Finnigan referred to him repeatedly as the motivator, he was inspired to take on the title as a stage name. He left the programme in 2000 after his daughter started having health problems and the family relocated to Jamaica. But Derrick regularly returns to the UK for appearances as Mr Motivator and is a familiar sight on the festival circuit, where he often takes a midday slot on the main stage and helps bring hungover festival-goers back to life with a workout. 1990s - Mr Motivator on GMTV with PJ and Duncan . The Noughties - Celebrity workouts . The Noughties saw an explosion in everything celebrity - no TV show, clothing store or perfume house was compete without at least one Z-list endorsement. The exercise video was one of the areas of entertainment most affected by this change -  year on year, more and more stars are claiming they know the way to get fit. Everyone from Big Brother contestants and Strictly dancers to Page Three Girls and even football WAGs has released an exercise programme. The saturation of the market has led to producers having to invent new ways of making the public choose their DVD over the others on the supermarket shelf. One of the solutions appears to be an embarrassing staged photo of the celebrity in question working out in ill-fitting skimpy swimwear and exercise clothing, while at their heaviest. The celebrity then loses their weight in record time and unveils their new body, compared to their old one.

Alan Grayson's wife Lolita Grayson  committed bigamy when she wed the congressman has been delayed because she required emergency breast implant surgery . Invalid marriage: Alan Grayson claims his 24 years of marriage were a lie because his wife never officially divorced her ex husband . The surgery was Monday. 'Due to this medical emergency, wife is unable to prepare for or attend the trial,' her attorney, Mercedes Wechsler, said in a court filing. Lolita Grayson sued her husband for divorce last year after 24 years of marriage. But Alan Grayson says the marriage was invalid because she was never divorced from her first husband at the time of their union in 1990. Lolita Grayson says she was divorced. The delay is the latest twist in the contentious divorce proceedings between the Democratic congressman from Florida's 9th District and his wife. Last year, Lolita Grayson filed court papers alleging Alan Grayson had failed to pay for repairs for the 5,300-square-foot Orlando house where she is living with their four children. The roof was leaking, broken windows were allowing rain to get inside and the house had a significant mold problem because of the moisture, she said. Domestic dispute: Last March, Lolita Grayson was granted a restraining order against the congressman after she said Alan Grayson pushed her against the door of their home but footage show Lolita pushing Alan . Grayson's attorneys denied the allegation, saying the congressman was spending more than $10,000 a month on the home's mortgage, child support, utilities and household expenses. Last March, Lolita Grayson was granted a restraining order against the congressman after she said Alan Grayson pushed her against the front door of their home when he stopped by the house. The Orange County Sheriff's Office investigated the claim and decided there was not enough evidence to file charges. A video of the encounter taken by a Grayson staffer shows the Lolita Grayson pushing her tall husband. In a related matter, Wechsler asked the judge this week if she could withdraw from the case as Lolita Grayson's attorney. Lolita Grayson brought along another attorney last weekend to a mediation session with her husband, and 'it's clear the wife has retained and/or paid other counsel to represent her in this case,' Wechsler said in a court filing. Neither Wechsler nor the other attorney, Tushaar Desai, responded to requests for comment. Grayson's attorney, Mark NeJame, raised doubts about the timing of the surgery. 'Of course, if she has a true medical complication, we want her to take care of it,' NeJame said. 'It is ironic that in all the decades she has had the implants, on the very eve of a hearing in which there is a chance this purported marriage will be invalidated, that this issue surfaces.'","A trial to determine whether U.S. Rep.

"For Christie Newport, life is lived behind firmly closed doors, hidden from the world. She shys away from social gatherings and is confined to her bed  - the slightest movement leaving her in excruciating pain. The 33-year-old was diagnosed with the rare neurological disorder Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome  when she was a teenager. It causes recurring facial paralysis or palsy, and a gradual swelling of the face and lips. Such is the complexity of her condition, Ms Newport has to take a host of medication including steroids, which have caused her to gain weight. Taunts from cruel bullies, who dubbed her 'rubber dingy lips', and the pain she faces each day left her feeling suicidal. Christie Newport, 33, was diagnosed with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome at the age of 18. The rare neurological condition causes facial paralysis, as well as swelling of the face and lips . Ms Newport, pictured with her wife Amy, said the constant medication, including steroids, that she has to take has caused her to gain weight . Various medicines, as well as plastic surgery on her lips, have failed to help. But after speaking to a fellow sufferer of the condition, Ms Newport discovered a new pioneering stem cell treatment, available in California. She and her wife Amy have now embarked on a mission to raise the £12,000 needed to fund the treatment. 'I have one of the worst cases there is and I just don't feel like I have a life anymore,' Ms Newport said. 'It's like it has been stolen by my illness. I'm prepared to do anything to get the treatment because I can't live like this. 'If I could avoid living like this, I would do it tomorrow.' Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare neurological disorder. Patients diagnosed with the condition suffer recurring facial paralysis or palsy, swelling of the face and lips. The condition is often first detected in childhood or early adolescence. After a series of attacks, the swelling is likely to persist and eventually becomes permanent. A sufferers lips can become hard and cracked, with a reddish-brown discolouration. Scientists do not know what causes the syndrome but there is thought to be a familial link, though no gene has been identified yet. Treatment involves various medications to target the symptoms, with anti-inflammatory medication and corticosteroids to reduce swelling. Source: Facial Palsy UK . At the age of 18, Ms Newport, from Ashton-on-Ribble, Lancashire, was told by doctors she was suffering Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The diagnosis came around 10 years after she first started suffering symptoms. 'I was really glad it got given a name and I thought it meant there would be some kind of treatment,' she said. But over the years, her health has worsened - so much so that her airways swell and she has problems with her lungs, leaving her in extreme pain. The condition has progressed to her epiglottis, larynx and face, causing her type 2 steroid-induced diabetes and a paralysed right diaphragm. And the steroids she takes to manage the symptoms have caused her stomach, arms and legs to swell up. Ms Newport, who is unable to have children as a result of the syndrome, said: 'The doctors always said their hope is it will improve as time goes on - but what has happened is the opposite. 'It's spread through my body now and I am lucky if I can get a couple of hours out of bed in the day. 'It has made me realise how limited my life has become.' But after years of coping with the condition, Ms Newport said she is now thrilled there is a treatment  that will reduce the inflammation and hopefully combat her over-active immune system. She said: 'I don't want my condition to get any worse. People don't get it. I feel isolated. Ms Newport, pictured age three, left and four, right, started to show signs of the condition when she was around seven years old, but it wasn't until she was 18 that doctors officially diagnosed her illness . Ms Newport has discovered a new stem cell treatment available in California, with her wife's help is trying to raise £12,000 to fund the stem cell therapy . 'There's times when I have felt ""what is the point?"" I move from the bed to the couch to the hospital. 'It would change my life and it would change the lives of people around me. 'I would do anything to have a life. I would get a career, I would do all the things that I am missing out on. 'But the fact it is in America means it costs money.' Her wife Amy, 25, who was forced to give up her job in a call centre to care for Christie, added: 'It is very hard. 'When we first got together we were always out. Now our excitement is going to her mum's for a brew. 'She will be in bed for most of the day. To people thinking about donating I would say ""do it, it would be amazing"".'

"Sunday night's AFC Championship game wasn't the first time that the New England Patriots have been accused of using illegally deflated footballs. The Indianapolis Colts first made the allegations during their game against the Patriots in November. The NFL said it was away of the problem prior to Sunday night's AFC Championship game. The NFL said it was 'aware' of accusations against New England prior to this weekend. The new report, which comes from ESPN, raises the possibility that the Patriots could have been cheating all season and got away with it until they were caught red-handed this weekend. It has been alleged that 11 of the 12 footballs the New England Patriots in Sunday night's game were inflated 2 pounds per square inch less than league requirements . Referees swapped out the offending deflated balls at the start of the second half after the Indianapolis Colts complained . Now, the Patriots are headed to the Super Bowl to face the Seattle Seahawks on February 1. It is an unprecedented sixth Super Bowl appearance for quarterback Tom Brady and a chance to tie the all-time Super Bowl win record for head coach Bill Belichick. NFL officials told the Washington Post that the deflate-gate allegations were 'very serious stuff' and pledged that the league was acting swiftly to clear up whether the Patriots had used illegal balls. Media reports say 11 out of 12 of the team's footballs were inflated two pounds less than the 12 and a half to 13 and a half pounds per square inch of pressure required by NFL rules. Each team is allowed to bring 12 of their own balls to every game and use those balls . It has not been determined why the balls were deflated - whether this was caused by the temperature and conditions outside or whether the air was deliberately released. However, the NFL said the calls were checked by referees before the game and all 12 were at the legal pressure. Balls with lower air pressure are easier to throw and easier to catch - especially in cold and wet conditions. With the win, Brady is headed to a record-breaking sixth Super Bowl - and has the chance to win his fourth . Nearly all serious sports commentators believe that the Patriots 45-7 trashing of the Colts on Sunday night would not have changed much - or at all - if they had been using regulation balls. However, many fans are furious about the new claims of cheating - considering Belichick has already been caught breaking the rules once before. In 2007, he and the team were fined $750,000 and docked a first-round draft pick after an assistant was caught filming opposing coaches giving signals to their defensive players. ESPN reports that during the Colts' November 16 regular season game against the Patriots, the Indianapolis equipment manager raised the question of whether New England was using illegal balls. Colts safety Mike Adams intercepted two of Brady's passes and gave the balls to the Indianapolis officials, who found that they were 'significantly' deflated, sources told ESPN. Colts officials brought the issue to the attention of NFL officials at that time, according to ESPN. The Patriots won that game 42-20.","Colts reported to NFL that the Patriots were using under-inflated balls during November 16 game in which they lost .

"A giant doorway to another universe may exist at the centre of the Milky Way, and it could be large enough to swallow spaceships whole. This is according to a recent study which claims it would be possible to travel through a wormhole in a similar way to moving through the space-time tunnel in the film Interstellar. Wormholes, allowing instantaneous travel between distant points in space and time, are allowed under Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Scroll down for video . A doorway to another universe,  large enough to swallow a spaceship, may exist at the centre of the Milky Way.  Wormholes (artists's impression pictured) are thought to allow travel between distant points in space and time . But most scientists dismiss the idea of ever building one large and stable enough to pass through, and no natural examples have been detected. The extraordinary new theory, published in the journal Annals of Physics, follows the discovery of what appears to be a super-massive black hole at the centre of our galaxy. According to the Italian authors, the black hole - a region of concentrated gravity that distorts space-time - may be a wormhole in disguise. The scientists, who base their conclusion on complex mathematical models, say the portal could be constructed from dark matter. This is invisible and mysterious material making up around 26 per cent of the universe. A recent study claims it would be possible to travel through a wormhole in a similar way to moving through the space-time tunnel (right) in the film Interstellar. Pictured on the left is the spaceship from the film . The researchers combined the map of the dark matter in the Milky Way with the most recent Big Bang model to explain the universe. Space-time can be warped and distorted. It takes an enormous amount of matter or energy to create such distortions, but theoretically, distortions are possible. In the case of the wormhole, a shortcut is made by warping the fabric of space-time. Imagine folding a piece of paper with two pencil marks drawn on it to represent two points in space-time. The line between them shows the distance from one point to the other in normal space-time. If the paper is now bent and folded over almost double - the equivalent to warping space-time - then poking the pencil through the paper provides a much shorter way of linking the two points, in the same way a wormhole would create a shortcut. The problem with using wormholes to travel in space or time is that they are inherently unstable. When a particle enters a wormhole, it also creates fluctuations that cause the structure to collapse in on it. 'What we get is that our galaxy could really contain one of these tunnels, and that the tunnel could even be the size of the galaxy itself,' said Professor Paulo Salucci, from the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy. 'But there's more. We could even travel through this tunnel, since, based on our calculations, it could be navigable. Just like the one we've all seen in the recent film 'Interstellar''. He said the research was surprisingly close to what was depicted in director Christopher Nolan's movie, for which theoretical physicist Kip Thorne provided technical assistance. 'What we tried to do in our study was to solve the very equation that the astrophysicist 'Murph' was working on,' said Prof Salucci. 'Clearly we did it long before the film came out.' Any wormholes existing in nature have previously been assumed to be microscopic rips in the fabric of space-time. But the one possibly lying at the centre of the Milky Way would be large enough to swallow up a spaceship. Professor Salucci added: 'Obviously we're not claiming that our galaxy is definitely a wormhole, but simply that, according to theoretical models, this hypothesis is a possibility.' Other 'spiral' galaxies similar to the Milky Way - like its neighbour Andromeda - may also contain wormholes, the scientists believe. Theoretically it might be possible to test the idea by comparing the Milky Way with a different type of nearby galaxy, such as one of the irregular Magellanic Clouds. Any wormholes existing in nature have previously been assumed to be microscopic rips in the fabric of space-time. But the one possibly lying at the centre of the Milky Way would be large enough to swallow up a spaceship, according to the latest study. Pictured is an artist's impression . In their paper, the scientists write: 'Our result is very important because it confirms  the possible existence of wormholes in most of the spiral galaxies .. 'Dark matter may supply the fuel for constructing and sustaining a wormhole. 'Hence, wormholes could be found in  nature and our study may encourage scientists to seek observational evidence  for wormholes in the galactic halo region.' The study follows similar research last year in which physicists at  Cambridge University arguedthat some wormholes are capable of staying open long enough to send messages backwards and forwards through time. ‘My calculations showed that if a wormhole is very long compared to how wide it is, you can get negative energy created in the centre of the wormhole,' said Professor Luke Butcher . ‘It’s not quite the right sort to keep the wormhole stable – which is what I’d hoped - but it does mean the wormhole collapses very slowly' The wormhole would be open just long enough, Dr Butcher suggests, to send a photon through to the centre. Because the ends of a wormhole can exist at different points in time, if Professor Butcher’s theory proves correct, a message could be sent through time. Space-time can be warped and distorted. It takes an enormous amount of matter or energy to create such distortions, but theoretically, distortions are possible.In the case of the wormhole, a shortcut is made by warping the fabric of space-time (artist's impression pictured)","If a wormhole exists, it would be large enough to swallow a spaceship .

"Economy seats on airplanes are a tight enough squeeze as it is. And with roughly 64 per cent of adults in the UK classed as  overweight or obese, the size issue is becoming more of a problem on  flights. As seating on flights appears to get smaller, the population is getting larger, prompting one expert to call for airlines to reflect this with their plane layouts. George Hobica says airlines should offer a new class of 'wide' economy seats for those who are larger . George Hobica, founder of airfarewatchdog.com  named 'Best Online Travel Expert' by Money Magazine, has come up with a solution. He's advocated a new class of 'wide' economy seats to accommodate those who take up more space. Rather than changing all seating on flights, Mr Hobica is advocating creating two rows of wider seats for obese passengers. The average economy class airline seat is around 17 inches wide, which Mr Hobica claims can even be too small for people who are of a larger build but don't have a weight issue, causing discomfort for neighbouring passengers. Economy seats measure 17 inches wide although many people, including body builders, surpass that . As policy with more airlines stands, they request 'passengers of size' who can't fully lower the arm rest because of their width, to buy an extra seat (although most don't bother) and in extreme cases crew can refuse to let overweight passengers board flights. George Hobica suggests adding one or two rows of  'economy-class wide' seats to planes instead, similar to the economy comfort seating which is offered by American Airline Delta. The carrier charges up to $75 (£50) extra each way depending on whether the flight is domestic or international. For that fee, customers receive up to four inches more legroom and up to 50 per cent more seat recline. Mr Hobica said: 'Why not install one or two rows - just four or eight economy seats - in a two-by-two configuration with the standard amount of legroom? Most airline's irlines policy says 'passengers of size' should buy an extra seat or might be refused to board . 'No extra perks - no priority boarding, no free snacks - just extra width, and charge the same that airlines now charge for extra legroom.' 'These seats would be about eight inches wider. If no ""passengers of size"" needed or reserved them, then the airlines could give them to their frequent fliers at check-in or to lucky passengers by the luck of the draw. This would be a great status perk and solve the spill-over issue.' In the past, proposals from airline manufacturer Airbus to reduce seat sizes to accommodate new extra-wide seats have enraged passengers. 64% of UK adults are classed as overweight or obese, making the size problem a growing one on flights . Eighty-four per cent of respondents to a recent survey by Skyscanner said the move would be deeply unfair. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary also caused controversy by suggesting introducing a 'fat tax' for obese passengers, forcing them to pay more. The outspoken CEO's idea prompted a flurry of surveys to understand whether passengers were in agreement or against the proposal. Nearly half of the people asked (48 per cent) in a survey by Holiday Extras felt that overweight passengers should be charged extra to board their flight. Men in particular thought those carrying excessive body weight should pay the price, with 51 per cent of men in favour of additional charges compared to 43 per cent of women.","George Hobica, airfarewatchdog.com founder, issues advice for new seats .

"A High Court judge has ordered the name of a woman sent to prison to be kept from the public – despite rules saying no one should be jailed in secret; the practice was thought to have ended n 2013 after Wanda Maddocks, pictured above, was jailed for trying to remove her father from a care home where she thought his life was in danger, against a judge’s orders. The public were forbidden to know her name or any details of her case . A High Court judge has ordered the name of a woman sent to prison to be kept from the public – despite rules saying no one should be jailed in secret. Mrs Justice Roberts defied instructions from Britain’s most senior judges by banning her from being identified. The single mother, who was jailed for seven days for contempt of court, was suspected of planning to flee the UK to stop social workers taking her daughter into care. She was found guilty after failing to surrender her passport and the girl’s on a court’s orders. The High Court judge ruled that European human rights law overrides the British ban on secret imprisonment. She said the mother’s name must be suppressed to protect the privacy of her daughter, who is in the care of social workers in London. Her decision to order reporting restrictions was made despite guidance laid down in the Appeal Court less than two years ago on the authority of the most senior judge, the Lord Chief Justice. Mrs Justice Roberts made her ruling after being reminded by lawyers about the Appeal Court directions. It means the courts have returned to the practice of secret imprisonment that is thought to have ended in 2013 after the Mail revealed the case of Wanda Maddocks. Miss Maddocks was jailed for trying to remove her father from a care home where she thought his life was in danger, against a judge’s orders. The public were forbidden to know her name or any details of her case. Lib Dem MP John Hemming said of the single mother ruling: ‘This is a coup against justice. Civilised countries do not bang people up in secret.’ As the row over her imprisonment grew, High Court officials announced that a new hearing in the case will be held today ‘where the judge will bring the attention of counsel to the mandatory aspect of the 2013 guidance’. The mother was sentenced by Mrs Justice Roberts in London on Tuesday. It took place in open court and those present were able to learn her name. But the judge set down sweeping reporting restrictions meaning no one else is allowed to know. Social workers from Richmond, south-west London, had said they feared the mother might try to take her daughter to Jamaica. The borough’s children’s services staff, who want to take the girl from her mother permanently, said questions had been raised about the woman’s mental health. They called for her name not to be published, to protect the girl. Mrs Justice Roberts said: ‘There is no doubt in my mind these restrictions are appropriate.’ In May 2013, then Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge and President of the Family Division Sir James Munby declared whenever someone is jailed for contempt they should be publicly named, saying: ‘There are no exceptions.’","The single mother was jailed for seven days by Mrs Justice Roberts .

"To most of us, Katie Piper is the brave acid attack victim turned M&S model, dedicated philanthropist and, in recent years, something of a national treasure. But to fans of Channel 4 show Bodyshockers, she's also a presenting pro who manages to keep a straight face even when confronted with the most bizarre of body modifications and DIY tattoo disasters. To those watching as Rodrigo Alves, a flight attendant who has spent £125,000 on surgery, attempts to drum up some sympathy for his cosmetic surgery 'addiction', Piper's sympathetic approach can seem bizarre. Scroll down for video . Unflappable: Katie Piper manages to keep a straight face even when confronted with the most bizarre of looks . After all, here is a woman whose body was modified, if you can call it that, without her having any say in it, chatting to people about their uniformly self-inflicted woes. But Piper, 31, who has done more than most to raise awareness about the plight of acid attack victims, says these people are deserving of a fair hearing - even if that isn't apparent at first. 'We have all done things we regret,' explains the mother-of-one. 'But in most cases we can simply wash out that hair dye or take out those earrings. 'I actually feel really sorry for people like these because whether their appearance was an accident or intentional, it’s horrible to feel trapped in a body that doesn't reflect who you are.' This season of Bodyshockers has so far included Lee, a father of five from Grimsby who got a DIY tattoo on his face using printer ink while drunk and Joel Miggler, a German model who had his cheeks pierced and stretched in the name of art. The latter, says Piper, is one of the few who did make her do a double take. 'He had these holes in his face the size of coke cans,' she exclaims. All change: Stars of this series of Bodyshockers include Callum (left) and Ken lookalike Rodrigo Alves . Distressing: Father-of-five Lee attempted to remove his tattoos using a cheese grater . Proud: By contrast, Callum is so proud of his inkings, he's planning to tattoo the rest of his family . 'He did it all in the name of art but it was just so impractical for talking and eating and swallowing.' Equally shocking in Piper's eyes are the people who have been left so traumatised by their youthful mistakes, they've gone to extreme lengths to fix things. One such person was Lee, who resorted to scrubbing off his tattoos using a cheese grater but was left with scabs all over his face, and a man named Ernesto who took razor blades to his ears. 'He had had ear stretchers as a teenager and had been left with all this gaping flesh,' she explains. 'He had attempted to do a DIY reversal and cut into his own flesh with razor blades he had found in the bathroom - that really did shock me.' Perhaps more shocking though, are those people who say they adore their unusual new look - however bizarre and painful the methods used to achieve it. One is Savannah who won't be dissuaded from her quest to get beach ball sized breasts while a contributor from last year's series is Cherrelle who spent £3,000 on having holes punched in her cheeks in a bid to get dimples like Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's. Others, such as Callum, a tattoo fan from Scotland, have transformed themselves completely by getting tattooed from head-to-toe - something that Piper says is down to wanting to stand out. 'The alternative and underground scene is becoming a lot more popular  and people are having to find new ways to shock,' she explains. 'People tell me it’s quite addictive - not the actual procedures themselves but the attention that they get and in that sense, I think it is quite an adrenaline rush.' Not quite so thrilled are those who get inkings done under the influence - something that is becoming increasingly common. Those to do so include Stefan Owen, 20, from Gloucestershire, who appeared on last year's show with an arm that bore the legend: 'Barry is a T**t' and Holly Aston, also 20 but from Birmingham, who discovered friends had inked a penis on her shoulder during a drunken party. 'People should absolutely not get tattoos while under the influence,' says an animated Piper. 'It is such a bad idea. Oh dear: Holly Aston, 20, from Birmingham, woke up to discover friends had tattooed a penis on her shoulder . New mother: Piper says she would be horrified if baby Belle Elizabeth (pictured) got a tattoo in future . 'To make the sort of decision that has such an invasive and permanent result when you are drunk is obviously never going to end well. 'You would never be allowed to have an operation in that state so why tattoos?' Unsurprisingly, with so many bad examples to choose from, Piper says she would be aghast if her 11-month-old daughter Belle Elizabeth tried to get a tattoo of her own one day. 'If she wanted extreme surgery I would be disappointed and would wonder what I had done wrong,' says a horrified Piper. 'I have always tried to teach her that looks aren’t important.' But, she continues, 'if she wanted a tattoo, I would try and remember that I don’t own her body and she is free to make her own decisions. 'I bet she gets Bodyshockers tattooed across her forehead just to get me back. That’s always the way - if children are told not to do something they  rebel and do it anyway.' If the colourful cast of characters who appear weekly on Bodyshockers are any indication, so, it seems, do adults.","Katie Piper, 31, presents Bodyshockers, a show about weird surgery .

"Carol Vorderman is undoubtedly one of Britain's queens of style reinvention. Since she first shot to fame in 1982 as a mathematical genius on the Channel 4 show Countdown aged 22, the star has had more hairstyles than David Beckham and every member of Take That combined. This week, she made her biggest leap to date though - turning her natural brunette locks blonde for the first time. Scroll down for video . Carol Vordeman, 54, is one of Britain's queens of style reinvention. Since starting on Countdown in 1982 (right), she has had 22 different hair styles but 2015 is the first time she has ever gone blonde (pictured left yesterday) While most women might have looked a little unsure at being papped after such a drastic transformation, Carol, 54, smiled confidently into the lens of the camera. She has a head-start on most of her sex though - over the last three decades, FEMAIL has counted at least 20 hairstyles on the television personality. From dodgy perms to dowdy unlayered long hair with a blunt fringe, Carol's early years as a celebrity were almost reliably frumpy. But in the late nineties, she started to find her follicule footing and edged into fashionable territory, first with her take on 'The Rachel,' then with a mumsy version of Victoria Beckham's styled crop.

The former Countdown star, known for her beauty and her brain in equal measure, certainly looked race day ready as she turned heads upon arriving at the exclusive hotel. Although she's famous for her quick-thinking arithmetic ability, there was only one number Carol was interested in - the figure-hugging black dress she was wearing.

But I think I’ve got the balance right and I think that’s all we can do. ‘Your overall health is terrifically important and I try to remember that. I do like to do a two or three day fasts from time to time after recent research revealed the benefits it has to your system. ‘I take a lot of vitamin supplements and I drink proper juices – not the ones from a carton box. ‘I have eaten at least one avocado a day for as many days in the week as I can. And a bag of salad each day for as many years as I can remember.'","Carol Vorderman is one of Britain's queens of style reinvention .
Since starting on Countdown she has had 24 different hair styles .
But 2015 is the first time she has gone blonde ."
"A social media post helped put a wanted sex offender behind bars when it made its way to the predator's landlord. Wisconsin woman Jess Quilling said she knew something was off about the man her family had rented a room to, but she didn't realize just how right her instincts were until she started investigating him online. Though his mail had been coming in under a variety of different names, they confirmed his real identity was Shawn Anderson when they spotted his name on a wanted poster for child molestation and incest. A social media post helped put wanted sex offender Shawn Anderson behind bars when it made its way to the predator's landlord . 'His lies just kept piling and he couldn't keep track of (them),' Quilling told Fox 59. Upon discovering his real history, she says she was appalled. '(I was in) shock. Disgusted. Rage is a good word,' she said. Jess Quilling said she knew something was off about the man her family had rented a room to . She and her husband immediately turned him over to the authorities. Police said they had been hunting for Anderson since December. 'I’ve seen some of the worst pictures in the world, thinking there was no way anyone (could) identify this person. Then when it gets put on social media, within minutes … we have five tips with the same name,' said Steve Dubois of Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana. Without Quilling's instincts he might very well still be on the loose. Quilling said she's grateful Anderson only stayed a short time but worried what could have happened in the days when such information was not readily available. Though they may have asked him to leave, its unlikely they would have discovered the full extent of his crimes. 'Even 20 years ago, there’s no way we would’ve ever found him. … He was planning on going down south, either to Florida or Kentucky … and it was with a friend that had children,' she said.","Wisconsin woman Jess Quilling said she knew something was off about the man her family had rented a room to, but she didn't realize just how right her instincts were until she started investigating him online .

"Two years ago, aged 18, Tom Pyle made an impulsive decision that has cast a shadow over his life ever since. On a whim he had a large tattoo inked onto his chest depicting two women's faces - one of them with skull-like features - with the wording: 'We must let go of the life we have planned so to accept the life that is waiting for us' scrawled between them. His shocked and devastated parents tried for months to convince him to have the design removed but it was only the negative reaction of his peers on a holiday that finally convinced him to begin laser treatment. Janet, pictured with Tom, was devastated when she discovered Tom had had the massive tattoo . Before: Tom had the  tattoo depicting two women, one of whom appears mutilated, with the wording 'We must let go of the life we have planned so to accept the life that is waiting for us' in between them done on a whim . After: Tom is over half way through a course of intensive laser treatments to remove the massive tattoo . When Tom first expressed a desire to have a tattoo his parents Dave and Janet, from Sandhurst, Berkshire, were strongly against the notion. His mother Janet, 54, said: 'We told him there will come a point where you will regret it.' But despite discussing with Tom at length the permanence of a tattoo he had small designs inked both on his ribs and both his ankles. However, it was his third trip to the tattoo parlor where things went badly wrong. Janet only discovered her son had been inked with the massive design across his chest when she stumbled across a picture he had posted on Facebook. 'My first thought was ""oh my God, they are absolutely awful"",' she explained. 'We didn't understand why he would have chosen that image as it is so at odds with the Tom we know. Tom admits he didn't put much thought into the design, which he initially wanted smaller . 'It was grotesque. I found it disturbing and offensive as well as derogatory to women. One of the women looked like she had been mutilated. 'He is a caring, emotional boy who cares about what people think, and just so different from the image that tattoo portrayed. 'The quote suggested he had had a bad life, when in actual fact he has led a good, happy life. He was born so perfect and to me, now, I felt he was scarred, that he had destroyed his body. 'We were absolutely devastated. I cried constantly for about two weeks. I just couldn't bare to look at it and see what he had done.' Janet and husband Dave (left) were particularly upset as the design did not reflect Tom's character at all . It wasn't until he went on a summer holiday with his friends that Tom realised the impact of what he had done . And despite his outward bravado, Tom admits that he had his doubts about the tattoo almost as soon as it was finished. 'I had just strolled into the tattoo parlour and I saw a design and just picked it. There was no real thought involved. 'I initially wanted it smaller but they said it wouldn't be possible and I was so eager to have it done I just went with it. 'At the time all my friends were getting tattooed and I thought it was the 'thing' to do. We were all about to go on a lads holiday and we all wanted to be inked for the beach. 'The moment I walked out I was gutted. I was think ""what on earth have I done"". 'But obviously I had to pretend I was fine with it.' Although Janet and Dave begged their son to get the tattoo removed he insisted he like it and refused, despite his mothers obvious anguish. It wasn't until he went on a summer holiday with his friends that Tom realised the impact of what he had done. Dave and Janet,  centre, with daughter Laura, 24, far left,  were happywhen Tom (right) agreed to remove his tat . 'I got completely the opposite reaction of what I had expected on the beach. People were actually coming up to me and being like ""what the hell is that on your chest?""' Tom explained. Receiving an increasingly negative reaction Tom began to come round to the idea of removing the tattoo, much to his mother's joy. 'I was overjoyed when he said he wanted it lasered. Just over the moon,' she said. However, Tom still had to undergo the agonizing removal procedure. Speaking of the Cynosure's PicoSure tattoo removal treatment sessions, which he is still undergoing at a leading London tattoo removal studio, The Reset Room, Tom, now 21, said: ''I can't decribe it, it is the worse pain I've ever experienced. 'It is like a red hot elastic band being pinged against you over and over and I could smell my own skin burning. But despite the pain of the treatments, Tom and mum Janet are delighted with the results, although Tom will still need several more sessions to fully remove the tattoo completely. 'The guy before my first treatment was a rugby player and passed out; but the pain is better than the tattoo,' he said. 'I felt really happy after my first treatment and am becoming even more determined to get rid of them as quickly as possible. I definitely won't be getting another.' When asked what advice he would give someone considering a tattoo Tom says: 'I'm definitely not against them all together. But I would definitely say think about it. 'Someone told me, put the design up on your wall for a year or two. If you still like it after that then you're probably ok.'","Tom was 18 when he had  ink scrawled across his chest on a 'whim'

"The world's richest 80 billionaires have been revealed today - but only one of them is British. Indian-born British siblings Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja are the 66th richest people on the globe and are worth an estimated £9.1billion ($13.9billion). Of the top 80 billionaires - a group who will own more than 50 per cent of global wealth by next year according to Oxfam - 35 are from the United States. Rich list: Indian-born British siblings Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, left and right, are the 66th wealthiest people on the globe and are worth an estimated £9.1billion ($13.9billion) At 94 in the world is the UK's richest landlord Gerald Grosvenor - the 6th Duke of Westminster and godfather to Prince William -  who is worth an estimated £7.9billion ($12billion). At 119 in the list are property moguls David and Simon Reuben, right, worth £6.7billion ($10.2billion) Discovery: Oxfam has said that the richest one per cent of the world's population will own more than the combined wealth of the other 99% by next year . According to the Forbes list, the five wealthiest people in the world are Bill Gates (net worth $76 billion), Carlos Slim Helu (net worth $72 billion), Amancio Ortega (net worth $64 billion), Warren Buffett (net worth $58.2 billion), and Larry Ellison (net worth $48 billion). 492 people out of the 1,645 billionaires on the 2014 Forbes list are US citizens. Aside from Slim Helu and Ortega - who are from Mexico and Spain, respectively - all the billionaires in the top ten are Americans. Indian-born brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja top the list of the UK's wealthiest billionaires and the London-based pair run the global conglomerate Hinduja Group. The Hinduja brothers' pursuit of British citizenship embroiled the Labour party in scandal and cost two Blair ministers their jobs. The family have previously been implicated in an arms scandal in India their attempts to get British passports led to the resignation in 2001 of then Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson. He had been accused of lobbying for those passports in return for £1million donations towards the cost of the Millennium Dome. They gave the cash to fund the attraction's Faith Zone. Keith Vaz was also sacked when it emerged he had made representations on behalf of the Hinduja brothers as they applied for British citizenship. Days after he admitted doing so on their behalf in June 2001 he was dismissed. Their global conglomerate has a wide range of interests in businesses including bus manufacturing and banking. The next wealthiest, at 94 in the world, is the UK's richest landlord, Gerald Grosvenor - the 6th Duke of Westminster and godfather to Prince William, who is worth an estimated £7.9billion ($12billion). At 119 in the list is David and Simon Reuben, worth £6.7billion ($10.2billion), who are property moguls. But despite the top 80 richest people only containing one British family - the UK still remains the super-rich capital of the world. A total of 104 billionaires now call Britain home, with a combined wealth of £301billion between them. It means the UK has more billionaires per head than any other country. The Hindujas are competing to be the richest followed by Russian business magnate Alisher Usmanov, believed to be worth £10.65billion. A decade ago, a personal fortune of £700million was needed to be among Britain's 50 wealthiest people. The entry point to the UK top 50 today is £1.7billion, the Sunday Times Rich List found. There are 48 sterling-equivalent billionaires in Moscow, 43 in New York, 42 in San Francisco, 38 in Los Angeles and 34 in Hong Kong. Rich: (From left to right) Bill Gates's 2014 net worth was $76 billion, Carlos Slim Helu's $72 billion, and Amancio Ortega's  $64 billion, per the Forbes list published in March 2014. Eight of the top ten wealthiest billionaires are American . Wealthy: (From left to right) Warren Buffett's 2014 net worth was $58.2 billion and Larry Ellison's net worth was $48 billion . Britain's reputation as a financial capital and its relatively low tax regime have been credited for attracting 'non-dom' residents, keen to invest in property in London and the South East. The country now has one billionaire for every 607,692 residents, compared to one for every 1,022,475 in the US, which has the second highest number of billionaires per capita. Political and business leaders gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos later this week are set to be challenged over the issue of the widening gap between the wealthiest and the rest. A research paper released by Oxfam suggests the richest 1 per cent have seen their share of global assets rise from 44 per cent in 2009 to 48 per cent last year - with an average worth of 2.7 million dollars (£1.8 million) each. Oxfam said the 'very richest' of the top one per cent - the 80 individuals at the top of the Forbes Billionaires list - have seen their total net wealth rise from 1.3trillion dollars in 2010 to 1.9 trillion dollars last year. The report added: 'The wealth of these 80 individuals is now the same as that owned by the bottom 50 per cent of the global population, such that 3.5 billion people share between them the same amount of wealth as that of these extremely wealthy 80 people.' Brothers: Charles Koch (left) and David Koch (right) each had a 2014 net worth of $40 billion according to the Forbes billionaires list . Among the wealthiest: (From left to right) Sheldon Adelson's 2014 net worth was $38 billion, Christy Walton's was$36.7 billion, and Jim Walton's was $34.7 billion . The combined wealth of the 80 richest billionaires is the same amount as that of the bottom 50% of the Earth's population - 3.5 billion people - Oxfam said in a new report . Oxfam's report explained that it calculated figures from Credit Suisse and based its list of wealthiest figures off Forbes' billionaires list, which was published in March 2014. 'By 2014, the 80 people who top the Forbes rich list had a collective wealth of $1.9tn,' the charity's report said. The charity is calling for a crackdown on tax avoidance by corporations and rich people, as well as increased investment in health and education and equal pay legislation.","Eight of the top ten wealthiest billionaires in the world are American .

"Most children have comic book characters as their heroes but for five-year-old Kya Hoad, his hero is his big brother Calyn, 8. Calyn saved Kya's life when the eight-year-old pushed his brother out of the way of a four-wheel-drive travelling at 60km/h on August 30, 2013 in Springwood, south of Brisbane. The big brother got caught underneath the vehicle and sustained serious head injuries, which almost ended his life. Calyn Hoad (centre, pictured here with mum Shanalee, dad Benjamin, brother Kya and sister Ashanti) had his skull cut in half when he ran in front of a 4WD to rescue his younger brother . Calyn has defied the odds and is now walking again, but his parents are hoping he will be able to talk again . Mum Shanalee Hoad told Daily Mail Australia 'the 4WD literally cut [Calyn's] skull in half all the way around'. She said it was a miracle he survived . Mum Shanalee Hoad, 34, was taking her five-year-old daughter, Ashanti, to the bathroom after her dance class when Kya ran off. Quick-thinking Calyn ran after him before Ms Hoad heard the screeching of brakes as she came out. 'The parents around me saw me going into shock and they wouldn’t let me get up to [the accident],' Ms Hoad told Daily Mail Australia. 'Kya was standing on the side of the road just yelling out ""Calyn"". Calyn had gotten under the 4WD. 'I can’t believe he was still alive and still breathing. We waited for the ambulance... [medical staff] induced him into a coma and put ice on his brain to reduce the swelling. Calyn (centre) with his beloved siblings, Ashanti (left) and Kya (right), before his accident . Calyn got caught underneath the vehicle and sustained serious head injuries, which almost ended his life . 'The 4WD literally cut [Calyn's] skull in half all the way around. For someone to survive that was a miracle in itself.' The 4WD had severed Calyn's head, and caused such severe brain injuries that doctors warned Ms Hoad that he might never walk or talk again. In order to ensure that the swelling on his brain didn't spread, surgeons had to remove part of his skull. 'We were told a couple of times that we had to say goodbye to Calyn. Somehow he managed to pull through all of that,' said Ms Hoad. 'We were told the odds for him to walk and talk were very slim.' Calyn spend nearly three weeks in a coma at Brisbane's Royal Children's Hospital, where Ms Hoad and her husband, Benjamin, spent every day. When Kya went to visit his brother in hospital Ms Hoad said her five-year-old called Calyn his 'hero'. Ms Hoad said doctors were told 'a couple of times' their son may not survive his injuries . In order to ensure that the swelling on his brain did not spread, surgeons had to remove part of his skull . 'He would look up at me and my husband and say: ""Calyn's my superhero"",' Ms Hoad said. The eight-year-old eventually came home on Australia Day last year, and has been battling to recover movement in his legs. Calyn has defied the odds and is now walking again, but his parents are hoping he will be able to talk again. 'He still uses his wheelchair but he's enjoying walking, especially when we were told he would never walk again,' Ms Hoad said. Due to the accident, Calyn has at least three fits a day and sometimes his siblings have to catch him before he falls to the ground and potentially hit his head again, which could cause further brain damage. And now instead of his big brother looking out for him, Kya is looking out for Calyn. Ms Hoad said siblings Kya and Ashanti - pictured here with Calyn - all love and support each other . 'When Kya first came into the world, Calyn's always been a caring brother. He would get Kya get dressed in the morning,' Ms Hoad said. 'But now since the accident, the tables have turned. Calyn needs a bit more help, so Kya gives him a hand. 'Sometimes Calyn goes out the front door and it's dangerous for him, so Kya grabs his hand and walks him away from the door. '[Kya] grabs shoes and shirts in the morning to help get [Calyn] dressed and sometimes helps spoon-feed him, and Kya’s always smothers him in kisses and cuddles.' Out of tragedy came extraordinary kindness from strangers who helped the Hoads remodel their home in April 2014 so it was more comfortable for Calyn to live in with his wheelchair, hoist, shower chair and special bed so the family 'don’t have to turn him around every couple hours at night'. 'It's the most beautiful thing to be part of. The human spirit and kindness is so overwhelming amazing. It makes you feel so blessed. In 2014, Calyn was awarded the Spirit of Australia Child of Courage medal for his selfless act of bravery. Kya refers to Calyn as his 'hero' and his parents could not be prouder of their little boy . Calyn was awarded the Pride of Australia Child of Courage medal for his selfless act . 'If not [for the community support], we would be living in our in-laws house. It's great to be home and be a family again.' To help the family out with medical bills, Ms Hoad's sister-in-law, Rebecca, set up a fundraising page. They are hoping to raise money for Calyn to see a speech therapist and get an epilepsy-detecting dog. Ms Hoad said that Calyn is still Kya's hero, and that she was touched by the way her children loved each other. 'We are definitely really proud of Calyn. The children always look out for each other,' she said. 'I think that's really important in our family and we're definitely, definitely proud of our Calyn. It's been a journey so far.'

"A 48-year-old Florida daycare worker has been arrested after being caught kicking a child on a security camera. Linda K. Klemm, a mother-of-four from Tarpon Springs, has been charged with child abuse after the footage captured her attacking a 16-month-old girl who was sleeping on the floor. The incident occurred at the Kids Stop-N-Play day care in Holiday. The victim's mother, Crystal Faggione, 24, said she noticed red marks all over her daughter, Lillian, including one underneath her eye, three on her forehead, and a red, bald patch created when the worker kicked her daughter in the head, according to The Tampa Bay Times. Scroll down for video . Attack: Linda K. Klemm, a mother-of-four from Tarpon Springs, has been charged with child abuse after the footage captured her attacking a 16-month-old girl who was sleeping on the floor . They noticed the marks on Saturday, which was Lillian's third day at the center. Faggione called Stop-N-Play and explained what she' had found, but a worker said if there bruises, they did not come from the center. However after feeding Lillian, Faggione realized there were more marks on her daughter's head she hadn't realized. 'I took her up to the day care, and I said, ''This did not happen in my house. This happened here'',' Faggione told the newspaper. When Faggione took her baby to the hospital, the authorities were called. Police then reviewed the 16 cameras at the center, and found the footage of Klemm. In the video Klemm can be seen kicking the sleeping child - who was on the floor with a blanket and a teddy girl - at least four times. The discovery of the video appalled the local officers. Evidence: Klemm was charged after she caught on camera kicking Lillian, who was asleep . Security footage: The camera caught Klemm kicking the child at least four times .

'I'm appalled. I'm devastated. I've been here 22 years. Nothing like this has ever happened,' Swetland said. 'She has four children of her own.

"A murdered husband has been hailed a hero today by his devastated wife on Wednesday who said that he laid down his life to save the children from her ex-husband. Denise Mattison told ABC that when her ex, Plaxo co-founder Minh Nguyen, broke into her Virginia home last Thursday with a gun, her husband Corey lured him out of the back door and away from their children. Mrs Mattison said that her daughter, Madison, 14, and a younger sibling were able to escape and hide out in the bathroom to call the police. Corey Mattison (left) was allegedly killed by the ex-husband of his new wife Denise (center back). She said his final act of love was to protect her children by leading the gunman away from them at their Virginia home . Mrs Mattison, who married her late husband three months ago, told the network: 'He was my knight in shining armor... he literally laid his life down to save me.' The couple lived together with their five children - Mrs Mattison's three children from her marriage to Nguyen and Mr Mattison's two children from a previous relationship. Minh Nguyen, the 38-year-old co-founder of pre-Facebook social network Plaxo, was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday. Minh Nguyen has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting dead his ex-wife's new husband . He was arraigned on Tuesday and was held without bond. He is due back to court for a January 28 bond hearing. He allegedly shot dead Corey Mattison, a former minor league pitcher with the St. Louis Cardinals, after breaking into the newlyweds' townhouse in Ashburn, Virginia. Two of Nguyen's three children with his ex-wife were present at the time of the shooting at 9.30pm last Thursday, police said. Denise walked in with her third child during the attack, according to a reported from the Londoun County Sheriff's Office. Nobody else was injured in the attack. Nguyen was arrested without incident after being captured by his mother, who held him down and called the police, NBC reported. Officers found the mother and son struggling over his gun. He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bond. Mattison, who had two elementary-school-aged children of his own, was a project manager at a glass construction company based in Washington, D.C., WPBF reported. His colleagues told the station Mattison spent a lot of time with his children as well as Nguyen's. 'Corey and his wife would go to a baseball game with the kids, and [Nguyen] would blow up,' his colleague Rick Knutson said. 'He would try to prevent them from taking the kids anywhere. The guy seemed to be a little unstable.' Nguyen, a major figure in the U.S. technology business, co-founded Plaxo in 2002 with Sean Parker, Facebook's first president. The site has since been bought by Comcast. The social network described itself as the 'world's leading online address book, storing over 50 million address books with 3.7 billion contacts'. But Todd Masonis, a founder of Plaxo who was with the company through its sale to Comcast, said that 'in my nine years working on Plaxo, (Nguyen) wasn't involved in any capacity beyond some initial discussions with Sean (Parker, another Plaxo founder) before the company was incorporated'. Masonis, who is no longer with Plaxo, said Nguyen 'never met or worked with any of our employees, investors, or partners. I only met him socially two or three times. 'Unfortunately, he appears to have overstated his connection to the company. This is a really tragic situation and our hearts go out to his family.' Also, the edit history of Plaxo's Wikipedia page shows that as far back as 2006 a person identifying himself as Nguyen would edit the page to list himself as a founder any time he would be deleted. Court records from Nguyen's 2011 divorce do not indicate that he reaped any kind of lasting financial fortune from his association with the company. Corey Mattison pictured with his new wife Denise. Nguyen has been charged with first-degree murder . The documents said Nguyen was unemployed at the time and had been making less than $50,000 a year in the years leading up to the divorce decree. Papers show that he was ordered to pay only $750 a month in child support for the couple's three children. Nguyen, graduated from George Mason University with a degree in Multimedia Design in 1997, and was based in Washington, D.C. Having started out as an interface programmer at AOL, Nguyen's post-Plaxo career saw him take up advising roles at numerous apps and websites. In 2012, he became the founding CEO of App Press, which provided tools for designers to build, manage and deploy apps. He is currently an advisor to for at least three tech firms and the chairman of Syllabuster, a mobile platform for students and teachers. Tech company founder Nguyen, 38, allegedly broke into his ex-wife's home in Ashburn, Virginia, at 9.30pm on Thursday and shot dead her husband .","Denise Mattison called her late husband 'a knight in shining armor' for leading the alleged gunman Minh Nguyen away from her children .

"Warning alarms in AirAsia flight QZ8501 were 'screaming' as the pilots desperately tried to stabilise the plane just before it plunged into the Java Sea last month, a crash investigator said Wednesday. The noise of several alarms -- including one that indicated the plane was stalling -- can be heard going off in recordings from the black box in the Airbus A320-200's cockpit, the investigator told AFP, requesting anonymity. 'The warning alarms, we can say, were screaming, while in the background they (the pilot and co-pilot) were busy trying to recover,' the investigator said, adding the warnings were going off 'for some time'. Scroll down for video . Indonesian officials examine the wreckage from AirAsia flight QZ8501 after it was lifted into the Crest Onyx ship in the Java Sea, on January 10, 2015 . The investigator, from Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), added that the pilots' voices were drowned out by the sound of the alarms. The revelation came a day after Indonesian Transport Minister Ignasius Jonan said that the plane had climbed abnormally fast before stalling and plunging into the sea, during a flight on December 28 in stormy weather from Indonesia's Surabaya to Singapore. 'In the final minutes, the plane climbed at a speed which was beyond normal,' the minister told reporters. The plane crashed in shallow waters with 162 people on board, but so far just 53 bodies have been recovered. Divers have been struggling for a week against rough seas and strong currents to reach the plane's main body, which was spotted on the seabed and is thought to contain the bulk of the remaining passengers and crew. The two black boxes - the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder - were recovered last week after a lengthy search, and investigators are expected to complete a preliminary report next week. Indonesian divers have retrieved the flight and cockpit voice recorders of Air-Asia flight QZ8501 from beneath the wreckage of the plane that crashed into the Java Sea .

As well as the cockpit voice recorder, the NTSC is examining a wealth of information in the flight data recorder, which monitors every major part of the plane. They are focusing on the possibility of human or aircraft error, after ruling out terrorism following an analysis of the cockpit voice recorder. Committee head Tatang Kurniadi said that the preliminary report into the crash would be completed on Tuesday, a month after the accident. He said the full report would not be released publicly but the media would be told some of its contents. There was a huge international hunt for the crashed plane, involving ships from several countries including the US and China. All but seven of those on board the flight were Indonesian. The foreign nationals were from South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Britain and France.","Warning alarms in doomed AirAsia flight  drowned out pilots' voices .

"A former executive at a New York investor firm has been sentenced to 2½ years in prison for insider trading ran through a gamut of excuses for his behavior before sentencing, going so far as to tell the judge that he only did cocaine because he couldn't drink coffee. Federal Judge Jesse Furman sentenced Michael Lucarelli on Wednesday in Manhattan. He urged Lucarelli to deal with anger he directs at others. 'I didn't take the drugs to get high, I did it because I can’t drink coffee — that’s a painful trip to the bathroom,' he said. Federal Judge Jesse Furman sentenced Michael Lucarelli (pictured in September 2014) to two-and-a-half years in prison on Wednesday in Manhattan after Lucarelli spent almost 20 years recounting struggles with drugs, impotence, family problems, and abandonment by friends . The Daily News reports that it was Crohn's disease that was responsible for his discomfot. 'He turned to it for the pain caused by Crohn’s disease, and working long hours — it gave him a little pep,' his attorney, Patrick McGinley, told reporters. The disgraced investor also admitted to struggles with impotence and a painful family history, claiming he had become a 'leper' to all his former friends. Before Furman spoke, a tearful Lucarelli said he hoped to sue investor relations firm Lippert/Heilshorn & Associates Inc., claiming it cheated him on commissions. He was also ordered to forfeit $955,521.62, the exact amount he was accused of having illegally earned . The judge rejected his explanation that he turned to crime because he felt bosses cheated him. When Lucarelli was first arrested in August, he ran out of his sandals as he fled photographers. His behavior earned him a mocking on a segment of 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.' He was also ordered to forfeit $955,521.62, the exact amount he was accused of having illegally earned. Lucarelli said he will sue his former bosses in response. 'The only problem I had in my 25-year career was when these people started to steal my commissions!' he said. Though now penniless and abandoned by his wife, he says he is now living in North Dakota with a brother. He'd like to become a truck driver. When Lucarelli was first arrested in August, he lost out of his sandals as he fled photographers. His behavior earned him a mocking on a segment of 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart' Though now penniless and abandoned by his wife, he told the court he was now living in North Dakota with a brother and planned to become a truck driver . 'The one thing about trucking, you’re urine tested all the time,” he said. 'If you’re a good driver, which I am, they don’t care about insider trading.' A previously released sentencing memo said he expects 'to be licensed and to drive tractor trailers', according to the New York Daily News. It also said he 'will never again trade another stock or work in any stock related field'. His statements have changed little since his case gained hit the spotlight. In a September hearing he described his crime to U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, Lucarelli apologized and paused briefly to cry. He had used non-public information from drafts of press releases to earn nearly a million dollars. He said long hours at Manhattan-based investor relations firm Lippert/Heilshorn & Associates Inc., where he was director of market intelligence, his failure to take vacation for two years and complications from Crohn's disease that led to a dependence on  cocaine, were in part to blame for his illegal trading over the last year. He said commissions for his work sometimes were not paid in a timely manner. 'Fueled by anger at not getting paid and a dependence on drugs, I made a serious mistake,' Lucarelli said. He added that it was the first time he had run afoul of the law in his quarter of a century in the business. 'I apologize to the court for my decision to trade on material nonpublic information,' he said. 'I wasn't strong enough to resist. I'm very remorseful.' The judge asked several questions about the trades he carried out in the securities of 13 of the firm's clients. 'Because of the physical pain and the dependence on drugs, I can't remember,' he said in one answer.","Federal Judge Jesse Furman sentenced Michael Lucarelli on Wednesday in Manhattan .

"The Republican congressman tapped to deliver a Spanish-language version of his party's State of the Union rebuttal Tuesday night added in a little extra salsa, and it's causing the GOP some Wednesday morning heartburn. Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo's speech was billed as a 'Spanish-Language translated address' offered alongside the higher-profile English delivery of Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst. But he inserted lines about immigration and the White House's new Cuba policy days beforehand. Speaking in Spanish, Curbelo said Republicans should 'work through the appropriate channels to create permanent solutions for our immigration system, to secure our borders, modernize legal immigration, and strengthen our economy.' 'In the past, the president has expressed support for ideas like these,' he said. 'Now we ask him to cooperate with us to get it done.' Ernst didn't mention the contentious topic at all. Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo gave a Spanish-language State of the Union response address on Tuesday night that didn't match the English version in several key respects – adding lines about Cuba and immigration . Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst never mentioned President Obama's revamped Cuba policy, and didn't advocate for changes in US immigration policy, but both items made it into the Spanish 'translation' Curbelo raised hackles in the Republican caucus after his election in November by suggesting that if President Barack Obama were to move unilaterally to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants, it might be perfectly legal. 'Yeah, it can be (legal),' he told The Hill newspaper in November, before Obama outlined his ambitious proposal to guarantee 5 million or more people living in the U.S. illegally that they won't be deported while he's in office. Curbelo added that Obama should keep his powder dry and give the new Congress a chance to act. But he has already voted against legislation to undo Obama's executive actions, indicating that he favors giving many illegal immigrants residency paperwork and work permits. The 34-year-old Floridian also mentioned Cuba on Tuesday night, torching the Obama administration for pledging to reestablish diplomatic ties there and open an embassy in Havana. Curbelo called it 'essential that the United States supports its allies and holds its enemies accountable.' 'We are disturbed by the administration's undeserved concessions to the regimes Iran and Cuba,' he said in his speech. 'Both countries are ruled by cruel dictatorships that decades have tried to harm our country and our allies.' REALPOLITIK: Cuban and US delegations are meeting on Wednesday in Havana to take part in negotiations to restore diplomatic ties between the two countries and eventually normalize relations . Curbelo, 34, has already broken with his party on immigration and opposed a measure  blocking President Obama's executive 'amnesty' for millions of illegal immigrants . Ernst's only mention of the Islamic regime was a soft pledge to 'work to confront Iran's nuclear ambitions.' But she never brought up Cuba. Curbelo is Cuban-American, so his audience would likely have been surprised if he omitted talk of the island nation just 90 miles from Florida. Obama, in fact, gave his rebooted Cuba policy two paragraphs – including four applause lines – in an already crowded State of the Union speech. 'We are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date,' he said. 'When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new.' 'And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere. It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba. It stands up for democratic values, and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.' Most Republicans and a sizable contingent of Democrats have approached the president's policy shift with suspicion, even as formal negotiations got underway on Wednesday between Cuban and American diplomats. Cuban dictator Raul Castro and his ailing brother Fidel are still Public Enemies No. 1 and No. 2 among Cuban emigres living in the United States. And Curbelo was talking directly to them. House Speaker John Boehner's press secretary, Michael Steel, told DailyMail.com that any controversy generated by the two different speeches is much ado about nothing. 'As in previous years' State of the Union responses, Senator Ernst and Congressman Curbelo spoke of the GOP vision of commonsense solutions and greater opportunity for everyone in this country – framed by their unique stories and experiences,' Steel said. Cuban dissident Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, known by the nickname 'Antunez,' was among pro-democracy activists invited to the State of the Union address by House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans . BACK TO WORK: Ernst took her seat in the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing room on Wednesday less than 12 hours after her star turn as the GOP's official Obama-debater . Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus shrugged it off during a Wednesday morning interview on MSNBC. 'I don't think it's that strange to have multiple people giving multiple responses,' he said of the mixed signals. Curbelo himself told Politico that Democrats shouldn't gleefully 'criticize us for each of us having our own priorities and ideas and making them known.' He claimed the Republican leadership was aware of changes he had made and approved.' 'I did not get any pushback whatsoever,' Curbelo said. He told The Miami Herald that party higher-ups 'had no problems. I don't want people to think there was a fight. There wasn't.' However, he said, he didn't add in personal beliefs of his that might be too contentious for many Republicans. The speaker's office doesn't seem concerned that Ernst didn't address Republicans' conflict with the president over his Cuba policy. Boehner's guests at the Capitol on Tuesday night included two leaders of Cuba's resistance movement. Jorge Luis García Pérez spent 17 years as a political prisoner for publicly denouncing Fidel Castro's regime. (He was released in 2007.) His wife, Yris Tamara Pérez Aguilera, founded the Rosa Parks Feminine Civic Rights Movement to help homeless women and children in Cuba. Obama, on the other hand, brought freed Cuban prison Alan Gross as a token of his own negotiating success. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio also brought Cuban dissidents to the speech, as did Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart.","Sen.
