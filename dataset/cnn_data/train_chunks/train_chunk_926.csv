"By . Katy Winter . It is not often a policeman has women throwing themselves at his feet begging to be cuffed. But then Grant Hazell is no ordinary policeman. The 35-year-old police officer, who hails from Suffolk but lives in Perth, Australia, is the doppelganger of Hollywood heartthrob Ryan Gosling. In fact, his incredible likeness to the film star has thrust him into the limelight, with strangers refusing to believe he is not the real deal. Handsome Grant Hazell, 35, makes £200 an hour as a Ryan Gosling lookalike . Ryan Gosling looking tough in the film Only God Forgives . With his trademark chiselled jaw and mesmerising smile, the resemblance sees him attract attention everywhere he goes - and even marriage proposals from women all over the world. One super female fan even refused to believe Grant was not the real life Ryan Gosling when she stopped him in the street. 'She told me she had seen all my movies and that she was in love with me. When I said I wasn't actually him, she didn't believe me. It was a surreal conversation,' Grant joked. 'He's a cool guy and a great actor. It's not a bad thing to look like one of Hollywood's most wanted men.' Grant re-enacting a scene from the film 'Drive', with his wife Caroline, 35 . Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan in a romantic scene from the 2011 movie Drive . Grant (left) has been signed by a US lookalike agency and has modelled for commercial brands and men's fashion magazines earning him up to £200 an hour . Grant was living a normal, albeit slightly charmed, life until May when he finally turned professional.. The handsome father-of-two was snapped up by a talent agency as a Ryan Gosling lookalike after his wife, Caroline, 35, sent off some photographs, convinced that he was a dead ringer for the star. Grant quickly realised his resemblance to the Notebook actor when Gosling burst onto the movie scene with the film Crazy Stupid Love and friends and family commented on the similarities. As Gosling's star rose, Grant too became more popular and has since landed modelling contracts and hundreds of followers worldwide. Grant, 35, said: 'Ryan Gosling has a very contemporary look which is very sought after in both the film and fashion industry. 'I don't find it hard impersonating him. I'm lucky that it comes quite naturally. I frown a lot which helps. Grant (right) started his career as a lookalike after his wife sent his pictures into an agency . 'I've really taken to modelling, it's such good fun and I hope I get to travel the world to do it. 'I'm a very lucky guy to have been given this opportunity.' The doppelganger has perfected Gosling's trademark poses and emulates the smouldering frown and tough guy exterior many people love about the movie star. He's lookalike work has been the talk of his friends and family - even his work colleagues now call him 'Ryan'. Grant added: 'My work mates think it's hilarious and one day when I went into work they'd put my picture up on the most wanted list, saying 'crimes against impersonating a celebrity'. 'I get quite a lot of joke emails from fellow officers and they have posters up of me and Ryan Gosling to show the comparison. 'They call me 'the most beautiful man in the cosmos'. They all find it quite amusing.' One American woman became so obsessed with Grant that she sent him more than 100 raunchy messages on Facebook. Grant says he has really taken to modelling: 'It's such good fun and I hope I get to travel the world to do it' Grant with his two sons Alex, 10 (left) and Sonny, 8 (right), who are very proud of their father . But to his swooning female admirers' disappointment, Grant is happily married to movie make-up artist Caroline and the couple have two sons, Alex, 10 and Sonny, eight. The couple met as teenagers and have been married for 13-years. After working as a mechanic in the army for six years and then a policeman for seven years, Grant opted for a change of scenery and emigrated with his family to Australia five years ago. Caroline, who has no complaints about being married to a hunky lookalike, said: 'At first Grant didn't seem interested in the fact he resembled Gosling and when I surprised him with a DVD of his film Crazy Stupid Love, he wasn't impressed. 'He refused to watch the film and was embarrassed that I suggested he looked like him. I loved the fact that he was the spitting image of Gosling.' Not wanting to see his natural talents go to waste, Caroline sent his photo to a lookalike agency in Melbourne without him knowing. To his surprise, they loved his look and signed him up on the spot. Since then he has been signed by a US lookalike agency and has modelled for commercial brands and men's fashion magazines earning him up to £200 an hour. He has even appeared in a magazine posing as Ryan as well as undertaking personal appearances as the Drive star. Police officer Grant has women falling at his feet begging to be cuffed, but insists he is just a normal guy . Caroline said: 'I've always thought Grant was gorgeous and women often fancied him. But since he's been working as a lookalike. the attention's gone through the roof.' 'The boys are so proud of their dad. 'Despite being a looker, he is very down to earth family man. 'Women propose to him on Facebook and girls even run up to him on the street, screaming with excitement wanting a picture.' Fortunately, Caroline isn't the jealous type and knows Grant only has eyes for her. Even though Grant receives hundreds of propositions from admirers he still keeps his feet firmly on the ground and doesn't let the attention go to his head. He said: 'People think I'm a heartthrob, but I'm not. I wash dishes, bath the dog. I'm a regular bloke. My family at home keep me grounded.'","Grant Hazell, 35, used to be embarrassed about his resemblance to the star .

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for MailOnline . Follow @@riathalsam . There is a statue in the Next Cristiano Ronaldo's living room of himself, allegedly carved from marble and life-size. The Next Roy Keane has just nominated Sir Alex Ferguson to throw ice on himself. It's fair to say Luis Nani and Anderson have made peculiar decisions. But what of Manchester United? The combined outlay for that pair was £42m. This week, Nani has returned to Sporting Lisbon on loan as part of the move that brought Marcos Rojo to Old Trafford. The 27-year-old's annual wages of £4.7m will be covered in their entirety by United. A good deal for Sporting, certainly. But also an indication of where Nani stands at United after seven years at the club. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nani arriving in Lisbon for his move back to Portugal . Fresh faces: Nani (left) and Anderson (right) sit in the stands just after signing for Manchester United in 2007 . Ill-fated: Nani poses with Sir Alex Ferguson (centre) and Owen Hargreaves, whose career was ruined by injury . Anderson recently returned from a loan at Fiorentina and was reportedly told that he, alongside Nani and Wilfried Zaha, could not train or eat with the first-team squad. His contract is up next year and on Thursday morning, Wikipedia, such is its vulnerability, listed his club as Witnisham Wasps. Suffice to say, things have not worked out quite as expected, even if Nani has shown considerably more of his talent than his hungry team-mate, who for a while has been a figure of fun. Last summer, when Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra discussed Anderson during MUTV's Rio Tour Diary, Evra said: 'I bring him his burger at 1 o'clock.' A joke said endearingly about a popular player, of course, but fitness has been an obvious problem for a player who is still only 26. In 70 starts, he has been substituted 51 times and finished only 19 games. He has scored five Premier League goals and never more than two in a season. Belly up: Anderson celebrates with Javier Hernandez after a goal against Reading in the FA Cup last February . Not fit for purpose: Anderson has struggled with injury and concerns over his all-round physical condition . Cheeky: Anderson's Wikipedia page has been changed by those poking fun at the midfielder . It's horribly disappointing for a so-called box-to-box midfielder, a player who Ferguson believed could fill gaps left by Keane and later Paul Scholes. Unlike Bebe, a terrible flop since moved on to Benfica, United did their homework on Anderson. Ferguson wrote in his most recent book about his brother Martin's excitement on a scouting trip to Porto. 'I sent Martin to watch him in every game for four or five weeks,' he wrote. 'Martin said, ""Alex, he's better than Rooney"". '""For Christ's sake, don't say that"", I told him. ""He'll need to be good to be better than Rooney."" Martin was adamant.' Nani's case has been less clear-cut. Like Anderson, he has been saddled with a comparison. It is not something he designed or encouraged, save for his early preference of extra stepovers, but he has been forced to compete against an aura he cannot match. Ronaldo, quite possibly, is the greatest United player that has lived. In that shadow, he has had significant high points. Three years ago he was named the club's players' player of the year award. He was part of the 23-man shortlist for the Ballon d'Or. He also scored United's fifth penalty as they beat Chelsea in the 2008 Champions League final and won four league titles and a league cup. But he was so inconsistent. He's been on the periphery for two seasons and scored only one league goal in that time. He was always more adept at assisting, capable in his work on either wing, but the spark seems to have gone for a player contracted until 2018. He's still only 27, but like his statue, his Manchester United career has stood still. Anderson's never really got going.

"By . Rosie Taylor . Its pencil skirts and cashmere cardigans are firm favourites with the likes of Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie. So British shoppers should have been delighted when J Crew opened its first European flagship store in London yesterday. Instead, they were astonished – because the prices are up to three times higher than in the US, for exactly the same items. Scroll down for video . Fleeced: The difference in price between J Crew's US and UK stores was laid bare as it opened in London . Hundreds of balloons were released as J.Crew, the iconic American retailer, opened its doors to the much anticipated Regent Street store in London . The Regent Street store is the brand's first British outpost and they have plans to open two or three more . The store located at 165 Regent Street will house separate womens and menswear departments along with Crewcuts childrenswear . Almost all the clothes and accessories in the new Regent Street store are on sale for the same amount of pounds as dollars, meaning a $350 (£219) black blazer is retailing at £350 – an increase of 60 per cent. But some are being sold at a far greater mark-up, including a silk shirtdress which is on the US website at a special price of $99.99 (£63) before tax, but in the London shop for more than three times as much at £198. The US prices do not include tax, which varies by state, but it is usually between 5 and 10 per cent of the sale price. Some prices in the Regent Street store at its launch yesterday were even higher than on J Crew’s UK website. A dress from the shop’s Collection range was £450 in store but £375 online – or $375 (£234) from the US site. Yesterday shoppers who queued to be first into the London store were angry to discover they had paid over the odds. American schoolteacher Daphne Shoesmith, 48, had visited hoping there would be UK-exclusive lines but was horrified by the prices. British shoppers were upset to find that they were being charged more than their U.S. counterparts . Some of the items in the London store are more expensive than the same thing on the retailer's British website . ‘It’s shocking that it’s cheaper in the States,’ she said. ‘I’m going to return the shoes I bought and get some when I get back if it’s less expensive.’ One shopper wrote on Twitter: ‘J Crew kids is adorable but same price in £ as it is in $ is a no go for me!’ While another said: ‘J Crew looking nice on Regent Street. Price hike from the States a bit cheeky though.’ But the company defended the prices, saying they reflected the ‘materials and craftsmanship involved’ and the levels of taxes, duties and operational charges. A spokesman said: ‘It is an inescapable fact that these costs in the UK are significantly higher than in the US. There are not many products that don’t vary in price from country to country. It is simply a fact of life.’ Michelle Obama, pictured in Downing Street, is one of J Crew's biggest fans - but a blazer will cost £350 .

"By . Adam Shergold . Louis van Gaal has admitted it would be a 'miracle' if Manchester United won the Barclays Premier League this season. The Dutchman compared the current situation at Old Trafford to when he took over an imbalanced squad at Bayern Munich in 2009. But while Van Gaal did go on an win the Bundesliga during his first campaign with the German giants, he concedes it is unlikely he'll be able to repeat the trick at United.

No repeat: Van Gaal won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich in his first season with the club but he doesn't believe the same thing will happen at United . The scale of his task was underlined last weekend when United were beaten at home by Swansea City on the opening day and they travel to Sunderland on Sunday in desperate need of a win. Asked whether he should be judged on his second season in Manchester as opposed to his first, Van Gaal replied: 'That is always the case. 'What I have experienced is that I was champion in Barcelona and in Germany, so it is possible but it is very difficult. 'When I got to Bayern Munich the [squad] selection was not stable. What we did was a miracle. 'Now here the selection is not in balance. There are five No 9s and six No 10s and so on. And we don't have defenders.'

Positive start: Ander Herrera has impressed since his move from Bilbao but is out injured for Sunderland . Incoming: United signed Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo this week for £16m . Transfer target: United are close to a deal for the Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria . When asked directly if it would take a 'miracle' to win the Premier League this season, he said: 'Yes I think so. It is always possible but it shall be very difficult.' Van Gaal will be with the injured Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw for the trip to the Stadium of Light, while Rafael and Danny Welbeck are doubtful. New £16m signing Marcos Rojo has yet to receive his work permit following his move from Sporting Lisbon and so is unavailable. United are inching closer to the £60m signing of Angel Di Maria from Real Madrid, with further progress expected on Sunday.","Van Gaal says he should be judged on his second season at Man United .

"By . Sophie Borland . Nurses should be banned from chatting loudly at night, wearing squeaky shoes or waking patients up for checks to allow them to properly sleep, according to their union. Members of the Royal College of Nursing are also urging hospitals to install slow-closing doors and bins, display ‘quiet please’ signs and hand round earplugs for patients at night. They say patients deprived of sleep are at higher risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, constant pain, aggression and delayed wound healing. Members of the Royal College of Nursing are also urging hospitals to install slow-closing doors and bins, display 'quiet please' signs and hand round earplugs for patients at night (file picture) Debbie Simmonds, from the RCN’s Suffolk branch said: ‘Sleep is a basic human need and fundamental to the basics of mental and physical health. ‘We know how important it is for patients to get a good night’s sleep yet we know that hospitals are getting busier and the patients we are looking after are getting more poorly. Addressing the RCN’s annual conference in Liverpool, she added: ‘Clinical noise depriving you of sleep creates an increased risk of hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, delayed wound healing, aggressive behaviour and reduced pain control. ‘Common sources of noise reported by patients regularly includes staff conversation, patient alarms and pagers. ‘Other common sources include squeaky drawers, bins, telephones, noisy shoes. ‘Local initiatives have included slow-closing doors and bin lids, use of ear plugs for patients, bleeps set to vibrate and telephones with their volume reduced. ‘There are also simple signs telling people it’s night-time and patients are trying to sleep.’ In March, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals emailed all staff telling them to wear shoes with soft soles at night and to only talk behind closed doors. In March, Royal Sussex County Hospital (above) emailed all staff telling them to wear shoes with soft soles at night and to only talk behind closed doors.

It followed a similar initiative at Western Sussex hospitals the previous year which had resulted in a drop in complaints about noise from patients. Bethann Siviter, a nurse from the RCN’s South Birmingham RCN branch, who suffers from a chronic condition which means she is often in hospital, said: ‘I can tell you the bane of my existence is (nurses saying) ‘you should have seen what they were doing during the day...’, ‘oh the security guards are just coming by we should have a chat with them’ - they’re really loud. ‘How can I trust a nurse to help me with my pain if she is too clueless to know that when I’m sick in bed the last thing I want to hear is ‘if you go down to the canteen can you get me two bacon sarnies?’ - that’s the last thing you want to hear when you are in bed.” Maura Buchanan, the former president of the RCN said: ‘The source of most complaints I ever received as a manager were about nurses talking too loud and even listening to the radio at night, waking patients up for observations, which sometimes you have to do but sometimes you don’t, even waking patients up to give them sleeping tablets. ‘The solution is easy, keep quiet.'","Royal College of Nursing is urging hospitals to display 'quiet please' signs .

"By . Deni Kirkova . Brides on a budget are flocking to a local charity shop after a mystery donor gave them £60,000 worth of new wedding dresses. Staff at the PDSA store in Bournemouth, Dorset, were shocked when they opened several cardboard boxes left for them to find 100 pristine wedding and bridesmaid gowns inside. The garments have a combined retail price of almost £60,000, but the charity shop is selling them for hugely discounted prices. Customers Debbie Johnson, Denise Johnson and Stephanie Bossert wait patiently to try on a wedding dress whilst Amelia Platt tries one on . The average original retail price of a dress is £600, but one spectacular gown worth £1,500 is up for sale for £250. And since the dresses went on sale the shop in Boscombe has been swamped by young women. The small store has just one fitting room but staff had converted a stock room at the back to make a second. They have also brought in extra mirrors for the brides-to-be. The generous donor has not been identified but they are believed to be in the trade. Some of the frocks are ex-display and some are just excess stock. Annie Campbell, an area manager for the PDSA, said the charity stands to raise over £10,000 from the bridal gown bonanza. Amelia Platt from Charminster came to the shop to look through the wedding dresses . She said: 'I knew we were going to get some wedding dresses but had no idea how many and of what quality. 'But they are all new and many still have their tags on. 'There are dresses in varying sizes and styles, from meringue layers to something quite sleek. But they are all modern designs. 'Many of the wedding gowns have recommended retail prices of 500 pounds and upwards. 'We are selling the bridesmaid dresses for about £60 to £70 and the wedding dressed for between £150 to £250. The small store has just one fitting room but staff had converted a stock room at the back to make a second . 'We considered sharing the dresses out around our other stores but thought if brides-to-be are coming to try on dresses they will want as much choice as possible. 'We have had a fantastic response from the public. The phone hasn't stopped ringing with people asking how many dresses we have left and asking where we are. 'Our staff aren't experts but they are being honest in their opinion of whether a particular dress suits a person or fits right.

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Mauricio Pochettino wants to impress the Tottenham fans when he takes charge of his first competitive match at the White Hart Lane helm on Sunday. After an impressive 18-month stay at Southampton, the former Argentina international this summer penned a five-year deal to take charge at Spurs. QPR are the opponents for Pochettino's first competitive home match as Tottenham manager on Sunday, when they will look to build on back-to-back away wins at West Ham and AEL Limassol against former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tottenham train and Adebayor's hilarious Ice Bucket attempt . Leading the way: Mauricio Pochettino is hoping Tottenham can build on their impressive form against QPR . 'I am looking forward to it,' Pochettino said. 'We are looking forward to it, my first official game at White Hart Lane in front of our supporters. 'We hope that would be a good game and always to win. It is important to win and play well and develop our style and improve, which is important in each game. Try to improve. 'We watch a lot of games from them and the last game they played well but in football not always when you play well, you win. Old Guard: Former Tottenham managers Harry Redknapp and Glenn Hoddle are set to return to White Hart Lane . 'But, yes, it is a derby, we expect a very, very tough games.' Pochettino will be without Kyle Naughton for the Hoops' visit through suspension, although Emmanuel Adebayor, Christian Eriksen, Younes Kaboul, Aaron Lennon and Etienne Capoue are available having been rested for the energy-sapping trip to Cyprus. A terrible pitch and temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius made the first leg of the Europa League play-off against AEL a difficult evening for Tottenham. Keeping his distance: Pochettino still feels there's a long way to go before Tottenham develop their style of play . It was a match they looked set to lose until the introduction of Erik Lamela after 72 minutes - a switch which directly led to goals for Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane. The former's strike was a fantastic first-time effort and particularly important given his struggles in front of goal last season, although Pochettino played down the magnitude of the goal. 'Always goals are important for Harry and for Roberto,' he said. 'The strikers always need to score and it is important he scored and Harry scored.

"By . Matt Barlow for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Erik Lamela is painfully aware of the disaster that was his first year in English football. He does not try to hide from it and promises to put in the work required over the next few months to salvage his reputation as one of the brightest young talents in world football. The early signs are promising. Already, in the opening two games, Tottenham’s £30million record signing has shown glimpses of his quality and a tantalising hint that this campaign may be altogether different, under the influence of Mauricio Pochettino. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Erik Lamela prank a sleeping Roberto Soldado on flight . Back in action: Erik Lamela (left) tries to get past AEL Limassol's Samba Guidileye Dialo on Thursday . ‘It is something that can help me,’ said Lamela, aware that Pochettino, as a fellow Argentine, is being billed as the man to solve the mystery. ‘He has helped me a lot of times. But, really, it depends on me. It is down to me: how I train, what I do in training and in matches. Then I think he will put me on the pitch. I will play wherever he puts me. I have to adapt. If I am on the pitch, I will do my best. ‘It is a challenge for me because last season did not go as I had hoped: the injuries, maybe because I was not 100 per cent. These are things you have to overcome and change yourself. You always have to improve. I don’t know how far I can go but I will try my hardest to make my team win. I want to train to the maximum and continue to improve as a footballer. ‘I am still young. I can improve a lot but it depends on me. This season I want to help my team and my team-mates to reach our aims. My aim is always to give to the team all that I can and to be 100 per cent focused.’ Strike: Lamela has a shot on goal during Tottenham Hotspur's 2-1 Europa League win over AEL Limassol . Lamela started only three games in the Barclays Premier League last season after his transfer from Roma, where he scored 15 Serie A goals in the previous year. In all competitions for Spurs, he started 10 times and scored once, a goal against FC Sheriff of Moldova in the Europa League. He arrived less than fully fit, unfairly touted as the man to help Spurs fans recover from the loss of Gareth Bale but suffered back problems and related muscular injuries and his poor form made it hard to settle in England. There were negotiations with Italian clubs in January over a swift return to Serie A but the fee was a problem and Spurs would not agree to a loan. His season effectively ended in December, when Tim Sherwood cut him from his plans so he could sort out his problems. It cost him a place in the World Cup squad but allowed time to spend with his family in his native Argentina and return with a fresh mind and strong body. ‘It was great,’ said Lamela. ‘I now feel 100 per cent, without any injuries. I hope to continue like this. When I was injured, I was not good, I was not happy. I am happy to be playing football again and helping the team to win.’ Control: Lamela (left) on the ball during Spurs' 1-0 win over West Ham on the opening day of the season . During his time away, Sherwood was replaced by Pochettino, his third Spurs boss in 12 months and a fellow countryman who has faith in the 22-year-old to show his true value in his second Premier League season. Lamela started brightly in last weekend’s win at West Ham, although he suffered when they went to 10 men after Kyle Naughton’s red card, and he was the hero in Cyprus on Thursday, helping to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 win after coming on for the last 18 minutes. ‘I am happy, it went well,’ he said, speaking in Italian because his English is ‘not quite there’. Backing: Spurs head coach Mauricio Pochettino has shown faith in 22-year-old Lamela . He added: ‘To come on and help change the match was great. It was a really difficult match because of the heat. Mamma mia, it was super-hot. We are not used to it. The most important thing is that we came back and won the game and returned home as winners.’ Tottenham left back Danny Rose, who played in Thursday’s win, thinks he has detected a change in Lamela since his disastrous first season. ‘We were allowed a night out in America (in pre-season) and we all saw a different side to him,’ he said. ‘He really came out of his shell and was having a laugh and a joke with everybody. I was warming up with him last night and you could tell he was raring to get on the pitch. ‘He did well to assist Robbie (Soldado) for the first goal and was involved in the second.’ Rising high: Danny Rose (left) vies for the ball with West Ham's Stewart Downing at Upton Park last Saturday .","Lamela signed from Roma for a club-record fee of £30million in August 2013 .

"By . Pa Reporter . Blackburn have told Hull they have no intention of selling striker Jordan Rhodes after rejecting two offers from the Premier League club. The Tigers' initial bid, believed to be around £8million, for Scotland international Rhodes was instantly turned down on Thursday and their follow-up enquiry has also met a dead end. And Rovers released a statement on their official website on Saturday morning which read: 'We have recently received two official bids for the services of Jordan Rhodes from Hull City FC, both have been respectfully and categorically rejected. Transfer: Jordan Rhodes has been the subject of two separate bids from Premier League side Hull City . 'The owners of Blackburn Rovers wish to reassure fans that their intention is not to sell Jordan Rhodes as they, along with the manager and board of directors, feel that he is integral to our bid to gain promotion back to the Premier League.' The news will come as a blow to Tigers manager Steve Bruce, who said on Saturday morning that the two clubs remained in negotiations for the 24-year-old. 'I knew last night that there were conversations going on between the two clubs; that's as far as I know really so far,' Bruce told Sky Sports News. 'It's something that we're trying to progress, if that's possible. It's always difficult when you're talking about other people's players but there has been a bid lodged. 'I believe the first bid was refused but I do believe the two clubs are still talking.' FFP: Blackburn were worried they would have to sell Rhodes to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations . However, the subsequent statement from Rovers suggests Bruce will have to search elsewhere as he looks to replace Shane Long following his sale to Southampton. Blackburn paid a club-record fee of £8million to sign Rhodes from Huddersfield in 2012 and he only signed a new contract last month to takes his deal at Ewood Park up until the summer of 2019. Rovers fans feared the need to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations could see Rhodes jettisoned, though, with the east Lancashire club having posted pre-tax losses of £36.5m for the 2012-13 season. But Saturday's statement from the club stressed that Rhodes, who has scored 53 goals in 99 appearances, remains an integral part of Gary Bowyer's team. Tally: The Scotland international has scored 53 goals in 99 appearances for Championship side Blackburn . The statement continued: 'Despite the necessity to comply with and address the pending restrictions of FFP regulations, the owners feel it would be a detrimental step to lose our top goalscorer and such an icon of this football club. 'We made our intentions clear this summer when we rewarded Jordan with a new-and-improved contract and we stand by that. 'We want to give Gary Bowyer and the team the best possible opportunity to get back to the top flight and Jordan has been and remains a significant part of that aim. 'It is also important to acknowledge that Jordan has acted, unsurprisingly, in a totally professional manner during this period of speculation.'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . An obese woman who was convinced her crippling stomach pains were the result of overeating lost 5st - only to discover she had cancer. Alexis Boo, 38, reached 17.5st due to a diet of crisps, chocolate and takeaways. But after shedding the weight through a meal replacement plan, she found herself still suffering frequent stomach pains. Alexis Boo was 17st and suffered from stomach ache - she thought due to overeating. After losing 5st (right) she was still in pain - and tests revealed she had kidney cancer . Ms Boo (pictured before her weight loss) had to have one of her kidneys removed after her diagnosis . In November 2012 the mother-of-two, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, went to her GP and was immediately referred for a scan. This showed she had stage one kidney cancer. Surgeons at the Churchill Hospital in Harrow removed her left kidney and, to her relief, she is now in remission. Ms Boo, who is now a size 12, believes had she not lost the weight, she may never have been diagnosed with cancer. She said: 'When you’re big you worry about clothes and looking bad, but you don’t always consider the impacts. 'Being . that big you also don’t listen to your body. You’re not in tune - . you’ll eat when you’re full and you don’t stop when you feel sick. 'Therefore . if you have pains you put it down to having a bit too much food and you . get used to the stomach aches - so when I had cancer I had no idea at . all.' Stomach pain can be a sign of kidney cancer, but usually in the later stages. In a bid to shift the weight, Ms Boo switched to eating off side plates and ditched processed food. But when the stomach pain continued, she went to see her GP. She said: 'Had I not done that, I don’t know if I would be here now. Ms Boo (pictured since her weight loss with partner Peter) is now a size 12 and is in remission from the cancer . 'I would still be walking around with the tumour which would have got bigger or spread and could have been life threatening.' 'After having the tumour removed I made a pledge that I wasn’t going to just maintain my weight but I wanted to get fit too.' Two years on, Ms Boo now runs her own weight loss company, called Ideal Weight, and has gone on to lose a further 1.5st. Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in adults in the UK, with 9,300 people diagnosed each year. If found in stage one there is a 90 per cent chance of survival. But if left and discovered in stage four there is just a 10 per cent chance of living for another five years. The disease is more likely to affect people who are overweight and smoke.","Alexis Boo, 38, developed crippling stomach pains after reaching 17.5st .

The mascara is good, very thick and lasts all day and it's good to know that it's helping to condition your lashes whilst you wear it. It's pretty tough to get off though, we recommend using a gentle eye make-up remover like The Body Shop's Camomile Kind Eye remover as it can be quite stubborn. As for the eyeliner, if you have the knack for applying it, it looks great. However, it is very, very black so may be too heavy on some fair-haired ladies.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Three-year-old Alfie Williams was left profoundly deaf after a viral infection . A three-year-old boy who lost his hearing as a result of a mystery virus has become a social media star. Alfie Williams, from Medomsley, County Durham, was plagued by an illness which left him profoundly deaf. Devastated, his mother Danielle set about trying to raise awareness for the National Deaf Children's Society. Her #handsonears Twitter campaign has now gone viral - and attracted support from many famous names. Celebrities such as DJ Fatboy Slim aka Norman Cook and his wife Zoe Ball, Man Vs Food's Adam Richman, sprinter Iwan Thomas and TV presenter Andi Peters have all tweeted pictures with their hands over their ears. Mrs Williams, 33, a full-time mother, said: 'When the doctors told me about Alfie, I cried for about two months.' 'Alfie loved . music, especially the Beatles song Hey Jude, and we were . distraught when we realised he would never be able to hear it again. 'Then one day my husband John and I decided we had to turn it into something positive, so we started the Hands on Ears campaign. 'I put the photo of the family on Facebook and it just kind of took off - I never expected it to be this big. 'We've worked really hard, and Alfie's brothers and sister have been great, I've been blown away the support. 'Alfie is too young to understand the social media storm . he has triggered, but I'm putting together a montage of all the photos . to show him when he grows up.' Devastated but determined to make the best of things, Alfie's family started the Hands on Ears campaign to raise awareness of deafness. His mother Danielle (left) said: 'I put the photo of the family on Facebook and it just took off - I never expected it to be this big'. Clockwise is John, Alfie's father and siblings Charlie and Lewis . The #handsonears Twitter campaign has now gone viral - and attracted support from many famous names including DJ Fatboy Slim - aka Norman Cook - and his wife Zoe Ball . Alfie, who has a twin brother called George, started suffering symptoms of the virus in March 2012. His mother said: 'Normally he gets up straight away, but that morning he wouldn't. He was sick and I thought he was just feeling under the weather. 'But a few days later he wasn't getting any better, so we took him to the doctors where we were given antibiotics. 'But these didn't help either. He wasn't eating and his balance was off.' Despite numerous visits to the doctor, Alfie's condition was dismissed as an ear infection. But in November 2012, Mrs Williams realised Alfie wasn't responding to sounds. She said: 'When we shouted his name he wouldn't react. Sprinter Iwan Thomas and TV presenter Andi Peters have also tweeted pictures of their hands over their ears . 'Then when doctors did the sound test they told us was profoundly deaf. 'He was fitted with grommets and I hoped they would work, but at the follow-up test he still couldn't hear a thing. I was devastated and couldn't stop crying.' It is still not clear what caused Alfie's illness, but one theory is it may have been meningitis. Mike Wade, from the National Deaf Children's Society, said: 'We are extremely grateful to Danielle for raising awareness of childhood deafness. 'There are 45,000 deaf children and young people in the UK, and they are often vulnerable to isolation, abuse, bullying and poor self-esteem. 'That's why campaigns like Danielle's, that get people thinking and talking about deafness, are so important. 'She has done a fantastic job of raising awareness so far and we wish her every success.'

"By . Craig Hope for the Daily Mail . There was talk of the San Siro just 24 hours earlier, Steve Bruce allowing himself to dream of leading out Hull City at the home of Inter Milan. But it was opposite number Peter Maes talking of fairytale ties as he supped a Jupiler beer during his post-match reflections here in Lokeren. For Bruce and his boys are certainly learning the hard way in Europe. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hull City's Alex Bruce put off teammate David Meyler in photo shoot . Midfield battle: Hull's David Meyler challenges Lokeren's Alexander Scholz for the ball during the Tigers' Europa League play-off match at the Daknam Stadium . Tussle: Defender Paul McShane does his best to hold off a challenge from Lokeren's Belgian striker Nil De Pauw  who pokes a foot forward in a bid to win the ball . Lokeren (4-4-1-1): Verhulst 6.5; Galitsios 6, Marić 6, Scholz 6, Odoi 6.5; De Pauw 7 (Abdurahimi 88, 6), Overmeire 6.5, Persoons 6, Remacle 7 (Ngolok 77, 6); .

Booked: McShane . Attendance: 7,935 . Referee: Matej Jug (Slovenia) They were 10 minutes away from an embarrassing first-round exit against AS Trencin and now they must overturn a self-inflicted 1-0 reverse at the KC Stadium on Thursday if they are to reach the Europa League group stage. Allan McGregor – who saved a penalty during Saturday’s 1-0 win at QPR - was one of only two players Bruce did not rest, but he was probably left wishing he had. For it was the Scotland goalkeeper who blundered to gift victory to the unfancied Belgians. Lokeren had hardly troubled McGregor until the soft concession which settled the match just before the hour mark. The 32-year-old was far too casual in his attempt to play out of his area and Hans Vanaken seized upon his weak pass before rounding the forlorn keeper and slotting into the empty net. And Bruce, who confirmed a bid for Blackburn’s Jordan Rhodes, said: ‘We’ve had our first lesson of what playing in Europe is about. ‘Concentration levels are paramount and we’ve made a mistake which cost us. ‘We had three of four wonderful opportunities to score late on but unfortunately missed them. ‘If you make a mistake like that, at this level, it’s an awful way to lose a match. McGregor was a hero on Saturday when he saved a penalty but he’s made a mistake which has cost us.’ Bruce has made no secret of his intention to prioritise domestic matters but nonetheless admits he would be ‘devastated’ to bow out before the group stage. Yannick Sagbo is one of those who will be hoping to stake his claim for more pitch time in the wake of Shane Long’s sale but he did little to impress when hesitation cost him an early strike at goal on the edge of the six-yard area, defender Mijat Maric sliding to dispossess the dithering Ivorian. Sone Aluko was Hull’s hero in the last round against AS Trencin - his late goal sparing them the ignominy of an early exit - and he was unlucky to see a rising drive evade the target soon after. Nill De Pauw went in search of a breakthrough shortly after the restart for the second half and his vicious blast from a narrow angle stung the palms of McGregor at his near post. That buoyed a vociferous home crowd and it was Lokeren who grew in confidence as the half wore on, Vanaken taking aim with a shot which slid wide moments later. Hot pursuit: Hull defender Liam Rosenior chases forward after the ball as Lokeren's Jordan Remacle tries to keep up . Struggle: Hull frontman Sone Aluko sprints towards the byline and does his best to hold off the challenge of Dennis Odoi . But the youngster made no mistake when he capitalised on McGregor’s howler to give the underdogs the lead on 58 minutes. That seemed to spread anxiety through the Hull backline and their indecision presented Junior Dutra with a sight at goal for a second, the Brazilian blazing over from 12 yards when really he should have doubled the advantage.

"By . Sophie Borland . The elderly are still being denied life-saving operations by the NHS despite new laws to prevent age discrimination, leading surgeons warn. In some areas, no-one over 75 is being offered crucial surgery for breast cancer and very few undergo bowel cancer surgery or have knee and hip replacements. This is despite legislation which came into force in October 2012 making it illegal for NHS staff to deny surgery to patients on the basis of age alone. Discriminated: The elderly are still being denied life-saving operations. In some areas, no-one over 75 is being offered crucial surgery for breast cancer and very few undergo bowel cancer surgery . The Royal College of Surgeons says there is no evidence the situation has improved since then and is urging patients to be firm with their doctors if they feel discriminated against. In a report today, produced with the charity Age UK, the college warns of a striking postcode lottery between local NHS bodies in the rates of over-65s being offered surgery for breast and bowel cancer, knee and hip replacements and hernia repair. The college examined figures for the rates of surgery in the over-65s and over-75s for all of England’s 211 new clinical commissioning groups. Women treated in the best performing areas are 37 times more likely to have surgery for breast cancer than those in the worst performing areas. Seventeen bodies did not offer any breast cancer operations to women over 75 last year while three others commissioned more than 100. Bowel cancer patients over 65 in the best performing areas are nine times more likely to have surgery than those in the worst performing areas. Similarly, hernia patients in the best performing areas are 12 times more likely to be given an operation and those needing knee and hip replacements are 17 times more likely to have surgery. The college is concerned that such stark differences between areas mean that some doctors and managers are wrongly writing off patients because of their age. Professor Norman Williams, its president, said: ‘If age is being used as a discriminator it’s absolutely wrong. You have to base the decisions on the health of the individual in front of you. ‘Surgery is incredibly effective these days and much easier for patients to get over than in the past.’ He urged patients who felt they were being unfairly denied surgery to have ‘frank’ discussions with their GP or specialist.","In some areas, no-one over 75 is being offered crucial breast cancer surgery .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You may think that virtual reality is only used for playing video games . But the technology is now helping people with autism overcome crippling phobias and allow them to live more normal lives, researchers have found. A virtual reality room is being used to enable people to experience the thing that terrifies them the most in a safe environment. Using the technology, eight out of nine children were able to tackle the situation they feared. Scroll down for video . A virtual reality room (pictured) is being used to enable people with autism to experience the thing that terrifies them in a safe environment. Using the technology, eight out of nine children were able to tackle the situation they feared . Newcastle University said that four of the children taking part were found to have totally overcome their phobia. The treatment involved sitting in a room surrounded with screens which, using virtual reality technology, can be transformed into the situation that the patient fears. After using relaxation techniques and sitting alongside a psychologist, the child can gradually be introduced to the scenario. People suffering autism often face phobias which are so acute they and their families will avoid the situation. Scenarios created at the Blue Room suite in Gateshead include getting on a busy bus, crossing a high bridge, talking to a shop assistant or going shopping. People with autism (illustrated with a stock picture) often suffer from phobias which are so acute they and their families will avoid the situation . The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, tested the technology on nine boys aged between seven and 13. Dr Jeremy Parr, Clinical Senior Lecturer specialising in Paediatric Neurodisability at Newcastle University’s Institute of Neuroscience said: ‘Phobias have a huge impact on a child with autism and on the whole family. ‘Parents often find themselves taking action to avoid the situation the child fears, which can impact on school and leisure activities. ‘Currently the main treatment is cognitive behaviour therapy but that often doesn’t work for a child with autism, as it relies on imagination. ‘People with autism can find imagination difficult so by providing the scene in front of the child’s eyes we help them learn how to manage their fears.’ The screens in the suite create a 360 degree seamless world, without the need for the child to wear a headset or goggles. A tablet is used to move around the scene, allowing them to explore the situation they have previously found traumatic and parents can watch from outside via a videolink. Researcher Dr Morag Maskey said: ‘One boy was so fearful shopping that he would walk behind his parents with his hood up, refusing to even speak to people he knew. ‘We created a petrol station kiosk scene in the Blue Room where he picked up a newspaper. ‘With the help of the psychologist who was in the room with him, he learnt to control his anxiety with breathing and stretching exercises. ‘He then built up confidence over four sessions until he held a conversation with the shop assistant avatar. ‘At home his parents encouraged him to do more of the shopping on his own and use the techniques they had seen him practice. One parent of an autistic child involved in the experiment said that he feared heights and it was impossible to go on escalators (pictured). But after four sessions in the simulator, he was able to cross a bridge - something he couldn't do before . ‘The therapy was so successful that he is now able to go shopping with his friends.’ Dr Parr added: ‘Parents told us that they could see the difference in their children over the course of the four session programme - their children are now much better at coping with the situations that they once found distressing. Twelve months later, the children are still able to cope. ‘This treatment has led to big changes in the lives of some families. To see a child who couldn’t get on a crowded bus do so after just four weeks of treatment is amazing.’ Carol Povey, director of The National Autistic Society’s Centre for Autism, said: ‘A chance to explore stressful scenarios in a safe, virtual environment could help those whose lives are dominated by anxiety to better manage their fears, improving their quality of life.’ One parent of an 11-year-old, who was afraid of heights, said: ‘His phobia was so severe that even going somewhere like the Metro Centre would be problematic, as we would have to stick to the ground floor. ‘It was just impossible to go on the escalators. Even picking my son up would be too much for him at times, even that height scared him. ‘But after just four sessions in the simulator he was able to tackle a real life bridge that he had never been able to cross before. It has just made such a difference to our lives.’","Newcastle University's Blue Room is being used to enable people with autism to experience the thing that terrifies them in a safe environment .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . These heart-warming photographs show the unbreakable bond between a sister and her little brother. Lexie Till underwent a painful transplant operation to donate life-changing bone marrow to her three-year-old brother. Cuddling up to Drew, the 10-year-old cradles him in a protective embrace before selflessly going into the operating theatre to help her brother enjoy a 'nice life'. The three-year-old was diagnosed with Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, which causes his body to produce few or no red blood cells. Devoted big sister Lexie Till 10, donated her bone marrow to her three-year-old brother Drew who needed a transplant to help cure a rare blood condition . Drew (pictured left) was diagnosed with Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, which causes his body to produce few or no red blood cells and Lexie (pictured right) was found to be a suitable bone marrow donor . Lexie, pictured with her brother during the bone marrow transfusion, said: 'Drew means everything to me, he's really special, and I just wanted to help him so he can have a nice life' He was just four-months-old when he was doctors revealed he had the illness, which affects just 700 people worldwide. Lexie said: ‘Drew means everything to me, he’s really special, and I just wanted to help him so he can have a nice life.’ Her . brother had been enduring monthly blood transfusions since he was five . weeks old, as well treatment to remove excess iron from his heart and . liver every day. When doctors told his mother Helen, 43 that her son would need a bone marrow transplant if he was going to live a healthy life, the search for a donor began. Diamond Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) is a rare blood condition where the bone marrow fails to produce red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. Only around 700 people are thought to have it in the world. DBA can cause can cause fatigue, poor growth, lack of appetite and a pale complexion. Patients are treated with monthly blood transfusions to bring their red blood cell count up to normal levels. The body normally recycles iron from old red blood cells when producing new ones but this does not happen in DBA patients, where iron accumulates from the transfusions. Iron overload can cause damage to the major organs, so patients must take a 'chelation' drug to remove excess iron from their bodies. This often requires a nightly infusion of medication via a subcutaneous needle over a ten hour period. Many doctors think a bone marrow transplant is the best long-term option, but finding a suitable donor can be challenging. Source: diamondblackfan.org.uk . Lexie was found to be a match and told her parents she wanted to go through with the operation to save her brother’s life. Mrs Till, from Whitby, Elsmere Port, said: ‘We were told that Drew needed a transplant in October last year but my husband and I had already been tested and we weren’t a match. ‘Lexie was tested and she fortunately was a match and she said she wanted to go through with the operation. ‘I was . really anxious about her having to go through the process - putting a . healthy child through anaesthetic and an operation just felt very . strange. ‘But I was a lot happier once she was back on the ward eating and drinking and feeling better. ‘She just couldn’t wait to get up and go send see Drew.’ Doctors became concerned when Drew stopped responding to his treatment. The team caring for the three-year-old told his parents Helen and Andy, that a bone marrow transplant was thought to be the only way forward. And so last month the . siblings were admitted to Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at Royal . Manchester Children’s Hospital. On June 27 both children were taken into theatre for their operations. Their mother Helen Till, said: 'Drew received the bone marrow the same day and all went well. It was administered via a transfusion and Lexie was there to keep him company as it happened. It is an amazing process' The family (Lexie, Drew and their father Andy pictured left before the operation) were told that Drew would need a bone marrow transplant if he was going to live a healthy life. Lexie (pictured right with Drew) told her parents she wanted to go through with the painful operation to help her little brother enjoy 'a nice life' The siblings were admitted to Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital for their operations on June 27. Their mother Helen said they are both home and are recovering well . Mother Mrs Till said her children are now both home and are recovering well. She said: ‘She recovered really well, went home the same day and was back in school a few days later. ‘Drew received the bone marrow the same day and all went well. 'It was administered via a transfusion and Lexie was there to keep him company as it happened. It is an amazing process.’ Drew has begun his 12-month road to recovery. ‘We are so proud of Lexie for stepping in to help her little brother and it will be a blessing for the family to get some normality,’ Mrs Till said.","Lexie Till 10, from Whitby, Elsmere Port, donated bone marrow to her three-year-old brother Drew to help cure his rare illness .

"By . Margot Peppers . A father has hit back at critics who left racist comments on a picture of him adeptly taking care of his two young daughters. When Los Angeles, California resident Doyin Richards shared a photo of himself cradling his baby girl in an Ergo while brushing his other daughter's hair, the post went viral. But some commenters took issue with the color of his skin, making cruel assumptions about his lifestyle. 'I would bet anything that you're a deadbeat,' one nasty commenter wrote on his blog Daddy Doin' Work, while another said: 'Cute picture. Now why don't you hand the children back to their mom so you can go back to selling drugs or your bootleg rap CDs?' Internet controversy: When Doyin Richards shared this photo of himself cradling his baby girl in an Ergo while brushing his other daughter's hair, the post went viral, receiving both positive and negative feedback . While some of the critics made offensive remarks about his race, others commented on the fact that his children, who are three months old and three years old in the photo, don't share his exact same skin color. 'He probably rented those kids. They don't even look like him,' one commenter said about his daughters, whose mother Mariko is half-white and half-Japanese. Another suggested that being a doting father as an African American man shows weakness, writing: 'Look at this Uncle Tom. No chance he would be doing this if his kids were black.' Surprisingly, Mr Richards notes that many of the people posting racist comments were actually black men like himself, who had negative things to say about his mixed-race wife and daughters. 'I'm sorry, but I can't support a brotha who didn't marry a black woman,' wrote one such critic. To these people, Mr Richards hit back by referring to Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. 'I have a dream that people will view a picture like this and not think it's such a big deal' 'Grow up and stop being so f****** ignorant,' he wrote. ‘You're a damn embarrassment to Dr King and his legacy.' The . father-of-two added: 'If the first thing you want to do is to criticize . the skin color of my kids for not being as dark as mine, you have some . serious issues.' In the beginning of his post, which . was shared in October, Mr Richards explains that he took the month off . from work for 'baby bonding' with his daughter, who was then three . months old. He snapped the picture one particular . morning to prove to his wife that he could get both daughters ready for . school - including styling the older girl's hair - without her help. Ignorance: Some critics made offensive remarks about his race, and others commented on the fact that his children, who are half black, a quarter Japanese and a quarter white, don't share his exact same skin color . Cruel assumptions: 'He probably rented those kids. They don't even look like him,' one commenter said about his daughters, whose mother Mariko (pictured) is half-white and half-Japanese . Mr Richards explained that he . accomplished the task by putting his baby in the Ergo, standing his . three-year-old on a stool and 'working my hair magic'. 'After 15 minutes of multitasking, the . final result was a nice, tight ponytail for big sister and a happily . sleeping baby in the carrier. Mission accomplished,' wrote the proud father on his parenting blog. Little did he know the passionate response he would inspire by posting the photo on his Facebook and Twitter pages. Within hours, the photo had thousands of views, 'likes', shares and comments - some of them overwhelmingly negative. Not only did he receive racist comments, but he was also dishearted that there was such a strong . reaction at all to his photo, since he believes men who are devoted parents like him . should be the norm, not the exception. Hitting back: 'Grow up and stop being so f****** ignorant,' he wrote to his critics, many of whom are black men like himself. 'You're a damn embarrassment to Dr King and his legacy' Taking a stand: The devoted father-of-two added: 'If the first thing you want to do is to criticize the skin color of my kids for not being as dark as mine, you have some serious issues' 'I have a dream that people will view a picture like this and not think it's such a big deal,' he wrote. 'Think of the Mommy blogs you like to . follow,' he said. 'If they share their love for motherhood, you probably . wouldn't think twice about it because that's what moms are ""supposed to . do,"" right?' 'If the first thing you want to do is to criticize . the skin color of my kids, you have some . serious issues' He added: 'Until we can get to the point where men and women can complete the same parenting tasks and the reactions are the same, we will have problems.' He said of his love of fatherhood: 'Being a dad is one of the few things in life I'm actually good at. Of course I'm going to be passionate about this gig.' This post has garnered more than 230 comments on Mr Richards' blog, with many of his followers showing their support for him. 'What enrages me about this situation is that it only became a negative situation because you're a non-white dad raising mixed raise kids,' wrote one mother-of-seven from Mississippi. Good parent: 'We really need to change the narrative on what fatherhood is all about, get more changing tables in men's bathrooms, do all these things to help celebrate the great dads of the world,' he said . Backlash: One of his supporters commented: 'I can't believe anyone would look at a picture like this and find a way to take issue with something. Spending time actually raising your kids is a gift' 'The photo you posted melted my heart. It drew negative attention because you're not supposed to be a positive influence in their lives,' she wrote. 'You're supposed to be a dead beat. . . because that's what the societal mold would dictate, and they don't know how to process the fact that you don't fit into it.' One fellow doting dad said that he could relate to his dedication to parenting. 'Many fathers relinquish parenting duties to the mother, and take a back seat,' he wrote. 'This was never what I had in mind for my own child.' Another commented: 'I can't believe anyone would look at a picture like this and find a way to take issue with something. Spending time actually raising your kids is a gift for both you and them.'","Doyin Richards' two young daughters are half black, a quarter white and a quarter Japanese .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Susan Wilson died in her hospital bed of a massive heart attack after suffering severe internal bleeding . A grandmother bled to death in the 16 hours after her operation because staff were too busy to check on her condition. Susan Wilson was admitted to Nottingham's Queens Medical Centre to have her gallbladder removed in October 2012. The 59-year-old spent time on a high dependency unit before being moved to another ward where observations should have been carried out on a four-hour basis. But a nurse at the hospital failed to carry out the basic checks and the retired care worker suffered a massive heart attack as a result of severe bleeding the day after surgery. It was only when the nurse checked on Ms Wilson at the end of his shift that he discovered her lifeless, dead in her hospital bed. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust has now paid Ms Wilson's family a five-figure sum in an out-of-court settlement after bosses admitted 'failing its basic duties of care'. An inquest at Nottingham Coroner’s Court last November was told the mother-of-one could have been lying dead on the hospital ward for several hours. A nurse failed to carry out observations on her for 16 hours and only discovered something was wrong when she was already dead. Mrs Wilson’s partner Stuart Clift, 67, said: 'The hospital has agreed they were in the wrong and that they didn’t provide the care they should have done. 'I feel that to some extent, justice has been done but obviously there is no price you can put on anybody’s life, especially Susan’s. 'The circumstances of her death left me struggling to stay in the place we were living and I had a feeling of desolation after her death.' Mr Clift, who still lives in Larkhill Village, Nottinghamshire, added: 'We had moved to Larkhill for our retirement and thought we’d be there for 10 to 20 years. 'I never expected Susan would die within three years.' Ms Wilson had decided to go ahead with the operation to deal with a painful gallbladder and was aware of the risks because of an existing heart problem. After the surgery, she spent time on a high dependency unit before being moved to Ward E18, where nursing observations should have been carried out. Staff nurse Neil Bailey told last year’s inquest he was too busy on his shift to check on Ms Wilson and admitted her requirements were overlooked. Giving evidence, he said: 'At no point did I make a conscious decision not to attend to Susan. 'When I handed over my patients (at the end of my shift), I became aware I had entirely overlooked Susan’s needs and requirements and went to check her and it was at that time I discovered no signs of life.' The inquest heard how staffing concerns had been previously raised on the E18 ward, where Ms Wilson died. Mr Bailey had been caring for ten of the 28 patients on the ward at the time. Nottingham Deputy Coroner Heidi Connor criticised the treatment and described the situation as 'shocking'. The 59-year-old was admitted to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre to have her gallbladder removed in October 2012. But after being moved back to the ward following surgery Ms Wilson the nurse in charge of her care failed to make the standard four-hour checks, discovering her dead in bed at the end of his 16-hour shift . Recording a narrative verdict the coroner said staffing was a national crisis that needed to be addressed. She said: 'It goes without saying this is something the trust needs to prioritise to avoid tragedies like the one we have heard about today. 'To miss or delay one observation is one thing but to have no observations in an entire 12-hour shift and no notes at all is nothing short of shocking. 'It’s clear he (Mr Bailey) felt overwhelmed and I have some sympathy in that respect. 'Staff Nurse Bailey failed to provide the medical attention Susan needed.' Peter Homa, chief executive of . Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We reiterate our . sincere and unreserved apologies to the family for failing our basic . duties of care and letting Ms Wilson and them down. 'I feel that to some extent, justice has . been done but obviously there is no price you can put on anybody’s life, . especially Susan’s' - Ms Wilson's partner Stuart Clift . 'Whilst no amount of money can undo the distress the family have experienced as a result of this tragic case or compensate for their loss, we hope the settlement provides some financial security for the future.' The family received the five-figure sum compensation after taking their case to clinical negligence lawyers Slater and Gordon. Solicitor Paul Sankey, who represented Mrs Wilson’s family, said: 'Evidence heard at the inquest raised grave concerns about the quality of care Susan received and the processes that were in place at the Queen’s Medical Centre. 'It is clear that Susan’s tragic death was wholly avoidable. It is simply not acceptable that she was left to bleed to death on a hospital ward and it is important those responsible were held to account. 'Despite their loss, Susan’s family have been determined to remember her as the popular, happy, much-loved woman that she was. 'They now hope that important lessons are learned from the events that led to her death and that this will prevent other families suffering a similar tragedy in the future.' Mr Clift said Susan, who had one son, Sean, 41, had been 'well-liked' by everyone she met. He added: 'She was an active person and was very bubbly and gregarious. 'She would always talk to people before they had to talk to her. She is missed by all her family and friends.'","Susan Wilson was admitted to Nottingham's Queens Medical Centre in 2012 .

"By . Pa Reporter . Newcastle boss Alan Pardew felt his team should have got more than a point after Saturday's Premier League goalless draw at Aston Villa. The game was one of few real chances, with Magpies midfielder Remy Cabella sending one wide when he might have done better and Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan denying Daryl Janmaat and debutant Siem de Jong, and Pardew felt his side did enough to win. 'Yeah, I think so,' said the Magpies boss, who saw Mike Williamson sent off in the dying seconds having collected two yellow cards in quick succession. Chance: Debutant Siem de Jong squandered Newcastle's best chance late on in the game . Blunt: Pardew's side failed to create many good chances, but Pardew still thought they should have won . He continued on BT Sport 1: 'I thought we had really good control of the game - particularly in the second half. We absolutely dominated, but couldn't find the moment. 'When you get a lot of new offensive players, they're so keen to do well. You could almost see Remy (Cabella) trying too hard to force the moment. You can't really do that in football - you have to let the moment come to you. 'I'm pleased with the team. I think there's a good solid base to it. We know we need to threaten with goals and that will win us games. There were a lot of good signs again, but we haven't scored yet and that will be hanging on us.' On whether he planned much transfer activity before the window closes on September 1, he commented: 'We've got our finger on the pulse, as we've shown all summer. 'Whether we can get another body in or even two before the window shuts, I don't know, but I think there will be some movement - maybe one or two going out as well. We'll see.'

But for one little boy even the smallest of knocks can cause his skin to tear and blister causing him excruciating pain. Mason Crossley, known as a ‘butterfly boy’, was diagnosed with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB). His condition is so severe a simple act such as lying on his bed can cause his extremely thin skin to tear. The toddler, who is 21-months-old, struggles with everyday tasks such as putting on clothes, because the task can cause painful blisters. There is no cure for EB and his parents Samantha and Miles Crossley, of Crook in County Durham, can do little to make life easier for their son. Mrs Crossley, a payroll administrator, 29, said: ‘It’s really upsetting to see Mason in pain. ‘He’s a young, active boy and we don’t want to stop him from experiencing everything a boy his age should. But he has to be very careful. ‘He stumbled on to his bed once recently and the bed sheets caused a nasty blister on his face. ‘If he falls or knocks himself no matter how minor, he will always end up with a wound. He screams and cries in pain when we have to change his dressings. ‘It is hard because he doesn’t understand that he has to be put through pain to make him better, otherwise the wound will only get worse.’ One in 17,000 people suffer from some form of EB, and infants with the condition are commonly nicknamed ‘butterfly children’, because their skin is very fragile like a butterfly’s wings. Healthy skin is formed of three layers, but Mason is missing the middle layer, which holds the inner and outer layers together. In . August 2012, just days after he was born, the identity band around his . ankle caused a small blister - the first sign something wasn’t right. Mrs . Crossley said: ‘Everything went so smoothly with the pregnancy and the . birth. But soon after we noticed a blister on the back of his heal. Warning: Graphic content . Mason, who is 21-months-old, struggles with everyday tasks such as putting on clothes as it can cause painful blisters (pictured) There is no cure for EB. Healthy skin is formed of three layers, but Mason's is missing the middle layer, which holds the others together. This means that his skin tears easily and painful blisters common for the toddler. Nasty blisters can be seen on his shoulder and ear (pictured left) and thumb (right) Mrs Crossley, pictured here with her husband Miles and their son, said: 'It's really upsetting to see Mason in pain. He's a young, active boy and we don't want to stop him from experiencing everything a boy his age should. But he has to be very careful' Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a general term used to describe a group of rare inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile. Any trauma or friction to the skin can cause painful blisters. Mason has the rarest form of EB where blistering occurs at the junction between the epidermis and the dermis. In most cases, the symptoms of EB are obvious from birth. It is caused by faulty genes inherited from one or both parents. There are many cases when both parents are carriers of the faulty gene without realising it. EB is rare. Just one in every 17,000 children has it. There are thought to be 5,000 people living with EB in the UK. There is no cure for EB so the treatment aims at preventing blisters becoming infected. ‘It wasn’t until more began to appear that we started to worry. ‘The dressings used to treat the blisters became a problem too, pulling more skin off when they were removed. ‘My husband saw the initials 'EB' on the nurse’s notes when we took Mason to hospital about it. ‘We did the worst thing you can do at this point. We googled it. ‘We soon realised this was a serious condition and could affect Mason’s quality of life.’ It . wasn’t until March 2013, when Mason was four-months-old, that doctors . confirmed a diagnosis of EB following lengthy testing at Birmingham’s . Children’s Hospital. Mr Crossley, 30, a Senior Development Manager and Mrs Crossley are both carriers of the EB gene. If they had another child, there is a one-in-four chance they would also suffer from the condition. ‘It was agonising waiting to find out if Mason had EB,’ Mrs Crossley said. ‘Those first weeks and months are when parents can enjoy their new-born child and to have this hanging over our heads was tough. ‘It can take up to 30 minutes to change Mason’s dressings and it has to be done at least twice a day. ‘There . is the risk of blisters forming on his eyes, if he itches them too . much. 'This is dangerous because it could potentially affect his sight.’ Mr . Crossley is raising money for DEBRA, a charity which supports families . and Sufferers of EB by taking part in the Great North Run this year. Anyone wishing to sponsor him can visit his Just Giving page. Mason's hands are easily cut and blistered and his mother said: 'It can take up to 30 minutes to change Mason's dressings, and it has to be done at least twice a day' There is the risk of blisters forming on Mason's eyes, if he itches them too much.

"By . Tamara Abraham . News today that Jennifer Aniston cut her hair short because it was damaged by a Brazilian-style blowdry has not come as much surprise to industry experts. The controversial treatment, which uses a combination of formaldehyde and keratin to keep locks straight for up to three months, is considered the answer to a frizzy-haired girl's prayers. But top New York hairstylist Oscar Blandi, who counts Julianne Moore, Uma Thurman and the Olsen Twins among his clients, warns that one should proceed with caution if considering it. Proceed with caution: Top hairstylist Oscar Blandi wouldn't recommend a Brazilian blowdry to a client who is constantly coloring her hair because the hair might not be strong enough to bear the intensity of the treatment . Cautionary tale: Jennifer Aniston was forced to cut her hair short (right) after damage from a Brazilian blowdry . 'I think the treatment on its own is generally effective, but you have to make sure the condition of the hair is right for it,' he told MailOnline. 'I usually wouldn’t recommend it to a client who is constantly coloring her hair because the hair might not be strong enough to bear the intensity of the treatment. I think the key is testing a small part of the hair first, before doing the whole head.' For celebrity make-up artist and hair . stylist Rachel Wood, who works with Vanessa Hudgens, Rosario Dawson and Louise Roe, the Brazilian blowdry is more trouble than it is . worth - indeed she was not impressed by her own experience of it. The Brazilian blowdry began in Brazil in 2005 and usually uses a solution containing formaldehyde to straighten hair. The treatment involves washing the hair with a special shampoo that opens up the hair cuticles in preparation for the straightening solution which is applied, combed through, then left on the hair for 30 minutes. Next, straighteners are applied to ‘lock-in’ the formula and set the blowdry. Combining heat and formaldehyde prevents hair from curling, creating a long-term straightening effect. But when heated, formaldehyde emits a vapor which can cause symptoms including difficulty breathing and nosebleeds. Formaldehyde has also been linked to a raised risk of cancer. There is additional concern that if formaldehyde comes into direct contact with the scalp it can penetrate the hair follicle and permanently damage cells responsible for hair growth. The result would be that when hairs fall out, new ones will not grow in their place. 'Not . all Brazilian treatments are created equal,' she said. 'Many have . chemicals which can eventually damage hair so I'm not surprised Jens . doing the chop. 'I personally have naturally bushy hair and had the treatment done one summer but I found it left my bouncy locks a little flat,' she admitted. 'I would have been better off just spending extra time using straighteners or just going with the curly flow of my natural texture.' Ms Wood added that the maintenance was a frustrating extra expense too - especially given that the treatment itself can cost upwards of $300. Those with keratin-treated hair must invest in sulphate-free shampoo in order to maintain it. 'There are so many amazing hair products and tools on the market that I find this one beauty treatment that you can pass on,' she concluded. Ms Aniston had her hair cut last week by Chris McMillan - her longtime hairstylist who gave her the 'Rachel' cut in the Nineties. 'It wasn’t for a role. My hair went through a phase,' she admitted to Elle UK. 'I did this thing called a Brazilian and my hair did not react really well to it.' A study earlier this year from the University of California, Berkeley, found . that formaldehyde concentrations in the air around hairstylists and . customers exceeded limits set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health . Administration, the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and . Health, and the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. It is recommended that hairdressers use . products containing no more than 0.1 per cent formaldehyde, but researchers found that the popular Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional Smoothing Hair Solution contained 12per cent formaldehyde. Study author Michelle Stewart said that 'without proper engineering controls like local exhaust ventilation [the product] could expose hairdressers and their clients to formaldehyde at levels above the short-term occupational exposure limits.'","The actress admitted this week: 'I did this thing called a Brazilian and my hair did not react really well to it'

"By . Ruth Styles . Earlier this week, controversial Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld caused outrage after telling an interviewer that 'no one wants to see curvy women on the catwalk'. Now artist aleXsandro Palombo has given the German designer a taste of his own medicine by creating a series of cartoons that portray him as grossly overweight. And Lagerfeld isn't alone. Also in line for the Palombo treatment were Anna Wintour, Kate Moss and Tom Ford among others. Heavyweight: Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld probably won't enjoy seeing himself portrayed as an obese fast food fan . Fat and fashionable: Kate Moss and Tom Ford (right) get the aleXandro Palombo treatment . The Lagerfeld images show the designer bulging out of his trademark monochrome suit and ensconced in an armchair guzzling fast food. Donatella Versace is pictured spilling out of a tight red dress while an unusually dishevelled Tom Ford sits eating burgers in a crumpled suit. Palombo is famous for his controversial cartoons and is no stranger to portraying the likes of Wintour and Lagerfeld in unusual situations, having previously authored a series that showed Wintour performing scenes from the Kama Sutra with Homer Simpson. This time, says Palombo, the aim is to highlight the issue of fat in fashion - a subject that he believes is ignored. 'The topic of [being] oversize is still a . taboo in the fashion business,' explained Palombo. 'With this series, I . wanted to do a true tribute to the concept.' Palombo, who also revealed that his . favourite fashion icon is Anna Wintour, added: 'I think that fashion is . chasing obsolete ideals more than suggesting impossible ones. Not so glamorous: Vogue editor Anna Wintour looks a far cry from her usual gamine self in these cartoons . Mon Dieu! Carine Roitfeld is given a few extra pounds . Chunky: Lanvin's Alber Elbaz gets a fat-over courtesy of Palombo . Making his Marc: Designer Jacobs with a lot of extra weight . Body conscious: Both Donatella Versace and John Galliano are know for their dedication to looking good . 'We are living [through] big changes but I feel that fashion is living in the past - the 80s are long gone. 'Fashion magazines are becoming less interesting but they continue to offer sad and boring women as an ideal - they are obviously  the mirror of the editors more than their readers.' Despite his love of lampooning fashion's great and good, Palombo boasts a very stylish CV of his own. Previously a . knitwear designer, he showed his collections at Milan Fashion Week, before turning his attention to satire via his blog . Humor Chic. He describes the blog as a daily society portrait: . 'The best illustrated fashion chronicle, a point of view about costume, . politics, culture, society and celebrity,' and describes himself as 'the . father of Fashion Satire, visionary artist, author and critic.' Earlier this week, it was revealed that the Chanel supremo was facing legal action after telling an interviewer that 'no one wants to see curvy girls on the catwalk'. Although this is the first time the designer has faced court action because of his bons mots, he's not known for pulling his verbal punches. Here are some of the other injured parties: . Russia:  'If I was a woman in Russia I would be a lesbian, as the men are very ugly. There are a few handsome ones, like Naomi Campbell's boyfriend, but there you see the most beautiful women and the most horrible men.' Greece: 'Greece needs to work on a cleaner image. It's a big problem, as they have this reputation of being so corrupt. You can't be sure the money will go where it's supposed to go,' he concluded. 'Nobody wants Greece to disappear, but they have really disgusting habits. Italy as well.' The facially challenged: 'Life is not a beauty contest, some [ugly people] are great. What I hate is nasty, ugly people. The worst is ugly short men. Women can be short, but for men it is impossible. It is something that they will not forgive in life - they are mean and they want to kill you.' The politically correct:  'Be politically correct, but please don't bother other people with conversation about being politically correct, because that's the end of everything. You want to create boredom? Be politically correct in your conversation.' Pippa Middleton: 'Kate Middleton has a nice silhouette. I like that kind of woman, I like romantic beauties. On the other hand, the sister struggles. I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back.' Adele: 'The thing at the moment is Adele. She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice.' Lana Del Rey: 'Is she a construct with all her implants?' Heidi Klum: 'I don't know Heidi Klum. She was never known in France. Claudia Schiffer also doesn't know who she is.'","Cartoons are the work of fashion designer turned artist aleXandro Palombo .

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Newcastle boss Alan Pardew has challenged summer signing Remy Cabella to take over Yohan Cabaye's mantle as a match-winner. The 24-year-old France international was a target for the Magpies in the immediate aftermath of Cabaye's £19million departure for Paris St Germain in January, but they could not strike a deal with his club Montpellier at the time. However, their patience was rewarded last month when they finally got their man in a £7m swoop, and the newcomer showed flashes of his talent in last Sunday's 2-0 home defeat to champions Manchester City. New boy: Remy Cabella was signed by Newcastle from French side Montpellier for £7million this summer . Replacement: Pardew believes Cabella can fill the void left by Yohan Cabaye's departure in January . Cabella is by no means a direct replacement for midfield schemer Cabaye, but he possesses similar star quality, and Pardew is hoping he and fellow newcomers Siem de Jong and Emmanuel Riviere can provide the flair and potency the club so clearly lacked during the second half of last season. The 53-year-old said: 'They are different players. What Remy does in terms of great moments in the game, he can create them - obviously Cabaye could do that, so there's a similarity in that. 'You need a framework for those players and a platform to win games. Now we need the other side of it, that special quality that Cabaye gave us, that Demba Ba gave, Loic Remy gave us. 'Cabella is very much a replacement for one of those three names, and De Jong and Riviere and Facundo (Ferreyra) and Rolando (Aarons) and Ayoze (Perez), who came on and produced a nice cameo, have got to ring the same bell a those other players.' Cabella and his team-mates - De Jong could be handed a Barclays Premier League debut for the club this weekend after shaking off a foot injury - will attempt to open their account for the season at Aston Villa on Saturday following a creditable display in defeat to City. Gone: Yohan Cabaye moved to Paris Saint-Germain for £19million in January, leaving Newcastle short . Poise: Cabella showed some nice touches during his debut for Newcastle against Manchester City . Newcastle might have snatched a point had in not been for a stunning last-gasp intervention by Fernando to deny substitute Perez a late equalizer and Sergio Aguero's injury-time strike, and Pardew and his players have taken the positives from that performance. The manager said: 'We are in good shape. The feeling in the local media and press and among our fans is one of optimism. 'That's felt on the training ground as well. It's felt by my staff - and some of my staff have been here for 25 years. 'There's a genuine feeling we have got a decent side here, and I think we need a couple of results under our belt and then we will see how quickly it grows. Creative: Cabella is expected to help Newcastle attack more this season and score a greater number of goals . 'There are a lot of new players, though. Someone said to me, are we carrying a bit of negative history for last season, but only half the team were playing. The other 50 per cent are new.' Four of the men who started last weekend's game - Daryl Janmaat, Jack Colback, Cabella and Riviere - were making debuts, and De Jong's inclusion this weekend would further enhance that new look. While that creates its own challenges, Pardew admits significant change was required and has been delighted with the way owner Mike Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley have responded to his pleas. He said: 'That really helps lift the players who were here last year. That's massive, I think, when you have had a disappointing season and the disappointment on the back of Cabaye's departure. 'One of the points I have made to Mike and Lee, it's important for new players to come in quickly. We did that and I'm pleased with that.'

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Everton’s victory against Arsenal in April ended a run of 13 without one against the Gunners in the Premier League. Arsenal are the only away team to score six goals in a Premier League game at Goodison Park (in August 2009). Steven Naismith has scored four and assisted two in his last nine Premier League appearances. Arsenal have now gone four games without a win against Everton, their worst such run in the Premier League. Case for the defence: Arsenal last beat Everton in the Premier League when Thomas Vermaelen (second right) struck after just eight minutes to seal a 1-0 win for the Gunners at Goodison Park in March 2012 . The Gunners have never gone five league games without beating the Toffees in their history. Arsenal have not won their opening two league games since 2009 (which included a win against Everton). Last season Everton opened the season with two draws; they drew their opener last week at Leicester. Everton have scored at least two goals in each of their last six Premier League home games. But two of the Toffees’ last three Premier League home games have seen them lose 3-2. Arsenal won more away games than any other Premier League team in 2013-14 (11), yet ended the season with a goal difference of only +2 on the road.","Lukas Podolski is set to be left out of the squad amidst reports of a switch to Juventus .

"By . Peter Lewis . As a byword for barbarity, Genghis Khan has come down to us 800 years later as the cruellest conqueror of all time. We preserve his name to compare the perpetrators of genocide today to him. Is this tradition justified? That is what a new biographer should tell us and this one, John Man, has every qualification. He even speaks Mongol and makes Mongolia his stamping ground. He has written a very lively and enjoyable book on a very complex and baffling story. It is littered with names that you have never heard of and cannot pronounce, and the two you do know are not as you thought: Genghis starts a soft G — Chinghis — and his grandson was Kublai Khan, not Kubla as Coleridge had it. Barbaric: Genghis Khan's name has lived on for 800 years because of the mass killings that took place under his command . The first chapters tell how a poor, illiterate boy, originally called Temujin, got himself recognised as leader of the hitherto disunited Mongols. This near-pagan lad had one great conviction: that Tengri, the Mongol deity, had decreed that he was to conquer all the land in every direction. Why he believed this is a mystery. He set about it and every victory which he and his horsemen achieved confirmed his belief that God was on his side. In 1189 the Mongols decided he should have a new name: Genghis. It was unique and until recently no one could explain where it came from. Now, however, scholars believe it derives from an obsolete Turkish word, chingis, meaning ‘fierce, hard, tough’. The Mongols took naturally to the idea that they were the master race. Under Genghis — The Fierce Ruler — their empire swelled like a pregnant pig, swallowing up most of central Asia from the Caspian Sea in the west to the China Sea in the east, and taking in the great cities of the Silk Road, Bukhara and Samarkand. In the spring of 1211, he gathered an army some 100,000 strong and advanced across the Gobi to conquer the Chinese empire of Jin. The men took 300,000 horses and were armed with catapults which could lob rocks or firebombs 100 metres. Great empire: Under Khan's reign of terror the Mongol empire encompassed most of Asia . Behind this came herds of mares to provide the warriors with horse milk. Often this mass migration incorporated wives, families and sheep. The whole juggernaut probably ran to 250,000 with a million animals in tow. When they reached a fortified city their strategy was to surround it, starve it and invite its leaders to surrender or be annihilated. Those that refused were slaughtered to the last man, woman or child, but the same thing might easily happen to those which capitulated. Terror was the Mongols’ weapon — shock and awe. Genghis applied it ruthlessly. In 1219 he led his army westwards from China towards the ancient cities of Samarkand and Bukhara, the eastern outposts of Islam, which had a degree of civilisation undreamed of on the Mongol steppes. There they lay with domes, palaces, mosques, huge libraries and scores of scholars leading the rest of the world in maths, science, astronomy and general knowledge. Bukhara was stripped of its treasures, bombarded and burned until all the males ‘who stood higher than the butt of a whip’ had been killed. The Mongol juggernaut rolled on towards Samarkand, defended by some 100,000 troops and 20 elephants, which panicked, trampled their drivers and made off into the plains. When the city’s merchant leaders and senior clergy invited the Mongols in, they looted their treasures, their wives and helped themselves to such survivors as would make slaves. They moved on to lay siege to the remaining great city, Gurganj. By the time victory came, five months later, the invaders ‘were in no mood for mercy’. The figures recorded by Muslim historians are staggering: 50,000 soldiers killed 24 men each. There were 40 sacrificial virgins slaughtered at Genghis Khan's funeral . Genghis now turned his attention to Merv, an oasis city of mosques and mansions. Its ten libraries contained 150,000 volumes, the greatest collection in Central Asia. The Mongols entered the city and after separating 400 craftsmen and a crowd of children to act as slaves, drove the remaining population on to the plain. ‘Then,’ writes Man, ‘the killing started. The place was ransacked, the buildings mined, the books burned or buried. Merv lost almost everything and almost everyone.’ The Mongols ordered that no woman, man or child be spared. Each soldier in the 7,000-strong army was allotted around 300 people to kill. Most had their throats slit. Others were led out, 20 at a time, to be drowned in a trough of blood. You might have thought even the most hard-hearted troops would baulk at having to slit the throats of so many victims, but it doesn’t seem to have troubled the Mongols who would have despatched them, says Man, as easily as sheep. Merciless: Some historians estimate that as many as four million people were killed by Khan's soldiers . The fearsome leader remembered: A 16ft Genghis Khan statue in Marble Arch, London . He points out that it takes only  seconds to slit a throat, and that  for 7,000 soldiers ‘the slaughter of a million would have been an easy two hours’ work’. In the late 18th century the English historian Edward Gibbon placed the total slaughter at more than four million. The figure may be exaggerated, but it was certainly one of the biggest mass killings in history. Genghis then returned to northern China, which he had only partially conquered. By the second week of August 1227 he was on the verge of achieving an empire running from the Pacific almost to Baghdad. It was not to be. He became seriously ill — possibly with typhus — and just days later was dead. But not before having told his leading captives: ‘I am the punishment of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent me as your punishment’. Throat slitter supreme: Khan, whose real name was Temujin, was named Genghis by his troops because of his fierce personality . His body was secretly taken back thousands of miles to Mongolia, where it was buried somewhere unknown on a sacred mountain. Today, a massive mausoleum shows its visitors colossal statues of him — but no body. They are still looking for it. Did Genghis achieve anything but the Guinness record in bloodshed? John Man believes he had redeeming features. He allowed toleration of all religions — perhaps because he didn’t have much of one himself, except as a mandate for conquest. He allowed women to play a more leading role than other dictators and he employed anyone of talent, irrespective of where they came from. But he built nothing. He left no palaces, no writings, no philosophy, nothing but territories that owed allegiance to him. It is a relief to turn to his grandson, Kublai, for the rest of the book. Kublai had himself been recognised not only as the great Khan but as first emperor of a new Chinese dynasty, the Yuan. He built his new capital, known as Shang Du, which was mistranslated by Coleridge in his opium-inspired poem, Xanadu. Kublai’s normal palace there was called the Pavilion of Peace but for summer he built the pleasure dome that we all know. It wasn’t much like Coleridge’s dream. The sunny pleasure dome was not made on caves of ice. It was made of bamboo rods laid in a circle and supported by carved wooden columns. One of his great innovations was paper money. He gave China a new legal system. He built pagodas and adopted Buddhism. Altogether he was a lenient dictator. He grew very fat (the drink was to blame) and died at the age of 80. At this point he ruled from the Black Sea in the west to the China Sea in the east, covering a sixth of the world’s known land mass. But within two years of his death this empire had split into its component parts, according to nationality. The Mongol Empire had vanished, leaving a legacy to the world of precisely nothing.","Genghis Khan has been a byword for barbarity for the last 800 years .

The Sex and the City star told The Edit that she does not court publicity about her life as a wife and mother but she still has to deal with people attacking her over these roles. Most recently, she was horrified when someone wrote a Tweet questioning the parentage of her twin daughters, Marion and Tabitha (who were carried by a surrogate). She was so outraged, she personally replied with a number of her own Tweets. Style queen: Sarah Jessica Parker features in the latest edition of The Edit. She is pictured here wearing a jumper by Emma Cook, skirt by Peter Pilotto, trainers by Common Projects and a ring by Diane Kordas . SJP is now a fashion designer herself but here wears a coat by Mary Katrantzou, left. The actress said she has sympathy for designers now she knows the pressure they are under . She explained: 'I see mean stuff every day: when I look . at Twitter I scroll with one eye open and one closed. That particular . day, it was just one of the things I saw. 'I kept scrolling and then I . was like, ""Wait a minute, did she just say that?"" I went back and I . thought, ""Well, this isn't unhealthy paranoia, this is absolutely . conscious. This was a choice. She, not subtly at all, said that my . children are not my children.""' The 49-year-old, who is married to actor Matthew Broderick, says she doesn't understand why she is often the target of Twitter trolls. Fighting back: The Sex and The City star recently clashed with a Twitter troll . Private: SJP, pictured in a top by Erdem, bra by Dolce & Gabbana and skirt by Simone Rocha, said she is often too embarrassed to talk of her accomplishments . 'What is it about me? I am not somebody . who shows off her good fortune; I don't travel with bodyguards, I don't . live a very glamorous life - I am afraid of all that,' she told net-a-porter's magazine, as she poses for their photoshoot in springtime florals from some of London's best-known designers including Erdem and Jonathan Saunders. She added: 'I don't talk about my marriage; I am circumspect about my children. I . sometimes regret that people don't understand all that I do and all that . I am because I am embarrassed to talk about what I've accomplished - I . think it sounds self-centric and narcissistic.' Referring to the woman who Tweeted about her children, she said: 'I can't figure out . what she hated so much about me that she did that. And I just can't . imagine anything lower than that.' Loss: The star said she was saddened to learn of the death of her friend L'Wren Scott . But she said she can't let such incidents get to her: 'Other people can be mean, . and that’s something I just have to make peace with.' Through her best-known role as fashion-lover Carrie Bradshaw, Parker's own style has been emulated around the world and she's recently launched her own line of shoes and bags. She said the process was far from easy and has given her a new-found respect for her peers in the fashion industry. In particular, she referred to L'Wren Scott, who was a personal friend to the star. She said: 'My heart goes out to designers. The expectations, the demands they put on themselves. They put everything on the line. It takes fortitude to survive it. 'I feel so sad about L'Wren,' she continues of the designer who committed suicide this year. 'I have friends who struggle for no good reason; incredibly talented people who have to fight for attention.'

"By . Bianca London . When research revealed that two thirds of men across the country feel under pressure to make sex last longer, one Harley Street doctor set about finding a solution. After years of research and development, the first medically-approved climax control programme in the world has been unveiled and aims to help the seven million men in the UK suffering from premature ejaculation. A licensed, over-the-counter medical device, the Prolong Climax Control Programme includes a £200 vibrator that aims to desensitise the penis as part of a six-week training programme. Climax: Recent research revealed that two thirds of British men feel under pressure to make sex last longer and now a Harley Street doctor has invented a solution . Users are instructed to stimulate the . penis with the device to reach the point of near climax, at which point . they stop. This step is repeated three times, and the whole process . carried out three times a week for six weeks. Men can train alone or . practice the programme as part of foreplay - it also comes with lubricant to help avoid soreness. Help is at hand: The £200 over-the-counter medical device is a vibrator (white object pictured) that aims to desensitise the penis as part of a six-week training programme - it also comes with a lubricant . The Prolong Programme was invented by Harley Street doctor Dr. Andy Zamar to provide what he describes as a 'practical, affordable and effective solution for men looking to learn to control their climax, delay time to ejaculation and improve their sexual confidence and sexual satisfaction'. It was brought to the market jointly by Dr. Zamar and Tessa Fane, a Harley Street psychotherapist, as an alternative to psychosexual therapy, which they say can be time consuming, emotionally demanding and expensive, costing between £600 and £4,000. The makers say the benefits of Prolong programme are that it works instantly, has no side effects and offers a permanent solution. But does it really work? In a London teaching hospital run clinical trial, 61 per cent of men reported lasting 11 times longer during intercourse after using Prolong. In Finland, a further trial demonstrated an improvement of 72 per cent in lifelong sufferers of premature ejaculation with no side effects and continued improvement six months later. Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr Irina Panihhidina, who participated as a co-investigator in one of the clinical trials of the Prolong Programme, said: 'Until the development of this device assisted programme, treatment options available to men have been limited. 'I have seen first hand the results of the real difference it has on men and particularly their self-esteem and confidence. It’s a simple solution to a life-long problem.' Benefits: The makers say the benefits of Prolong programme are that it works instantly, has no side effects and offers a permanent solution . Dr Zamar, the inventor of Prolong, said: 'We know from clinical trials that the programme can help any man who wants to increase the duration of his performance and not only those who feel they suffer from  early or premature ejaculation. 'Premature ejaculation is an issue lots of men experience at one time or another, and avoiding addressing the issue only leads to sufferers feeling further isolated. 'The Prolong Climax Control training programme is a lasting, affordable solution that has been developed, researched and refined to help the seven million men in the UK, who struggle with early or premature ejaculation.' Claims to treat the problem by . desensitising the most sensitive parts of the penis just enough to allow . sufficient control over ejaculation thus delaying climax for a . reasonable period of time. To . do this, it uses a discreet hand held device as part of a six-week . training programme. The device is used three times a week in conjunction . with the start stop technique. Users place the device just under the . head of the penis then stimulate the penis. Once they reach the point of . near-climax, they stop before ejaculating by removing the device from . the neck of the penis. This exercise is repeated twice more – with . completion to ejaculation the third time if desired (as stated, this . full process is completed three times a week). The process is the . opposite of masturbation as it aims to not allow ejaculation.","£200 Prolong Climax Control Programme is like vibrator .

"By . Sandra Howard . Sandra Howard has picked her way through 60 of M&S's collection of party dresses and come up with the best eight to cover all party occasions . This time last year I stepped through the door to Jeffrey Archer’s magnificent London penthouse feeling great. Sportsmen, politicians and a few showbiz faces filled the room, with its sensational views of the Thames. But in my new little black dress, complete with flattering scooped neckline and flouncy full skirt, I felt I held my own. The dress was a High Street number — classic and understated rather than attention-grabbing, but I received more compliments on it than I can remember. I felt stylish, comfortable and, more importantly, sexy. (Judging from the look on my husband Michael’s face, he agreed.) Such is the power of the Little Black Dress, or LBD, a garment which can take a woman from frumpy to fabulous in the time it takes to do up a zip and slip on some stockings. And — joy! — never have we had more varieties from which to choose. After months of unflattering jumpsuits and garish neons being the height of fashion, the LBD is back with a vengeance on the High Street this season, nowhere more so than at Marks & Spencer, which has produced an incredible 60 LBDs in time for the Christmas party season. Its range promises cuts and fabrics to suit any age and occasion, but is there anything on offer which can hold a candle to the dress which caused interested looks at Jeffrey’s glamorous party? To save you time, I’ve reviewed all M&S’s Christmas LBDs, and here are my pick of the best... The secret support dress, £59, (left) has been voted best for a hot date while the £45 black ruched dress with sleeves scored a perfect 10/10 for dressing up or down . BEST FOR A HOT DATE . Secret Support Dress, £59 . Maybe I am being a little prim, but this is too fitted for me. I feel like I am wearing a girdle, and it does pull in tummy, thighs and waist to give an hourglass shape. It’s a dress for a date. But at 73 years old, dates don’t come along that often! It’s also a little short for me. However, at this time of year Michael and I often have parties to go to and he would love to see me in this. 6/10 . BEST FOR DRESSING  UP — OR DOWN . Black ruched dress with sleeves, £45 . This is my favourite. It drapes beautifully, giving a lovely, feminine silhouette and is comfortable, too. It would work well for a New Year lunch in town or for a casual supper with friends. It’s can be dressed up or down, as well as being impossible to crease. 10/10 . For glamour, Sandra recommends the Autograph leather pencil dress, £249 (left), and for attending winter parties the velvet sparkly dress, £45, provides a touch of fun . BEST FOR GLAMOROUS DAYWEAR . Autograph leather pencil dress, £249 . Nobody’s too old for leather if it’s cut well and I love that this dress fits like a glove. It reminds me of a Sixties sheath dress and it feels very soft against bare skin. I think I’d go up a size — I’m usually a ten — so that I could wear it with a shirt underneath, which would work for a daytime look. This would be a great dress to go from desk to drinks in, but my only gripe is the length: I would prefer another inch or so. It’s more expensive than the other dresses, but still very good value for leather. 8/10 . BEST FOR A WINTER PARTY . Velvet sparkly dress, £45 . This is fun and I love the puffed sleeves. The material is stretchy (no need for a zip) and it drapes well so doesn’t feel tight but holds its shape. If, like me, you are a woman of a certain age, I would recommend wearing this with a statement necklace, because there is quite a bit of decolletage on show. I am a little self-conscious about my scraggy neck, but chunky jewellery works wonders. Pick up the gold fleck in the fabric with a pair of gold heels. 9/10 . For any business dinners look no further than this hand beaded dress with lace sleeves, £79 (left), while the elegant black lace dress £69 (right) is perfect for cocktail parties . BEST FOR A BUSINESS DINNER . Hand-beaded dress with lace sleeves, £79 . This is a very formal style which can be a little ageing. It’s safe for any occasion, but almost too demure and conservative. Lots of women my age will like the cut, but I prefer a little more flair. It would look better on someone with a bit more cleavage than me. But the lace is good quality, and soft rather than itchy. 6/10 . BEST FOR  COCKTAIL PARTIES . Black lace dress, £69 . My head is not usually turned by fads, but lace does seem to be everywhere this year, and I’d rather buy this from M&S than spend a fortune on a designer version. It’s a great party dress — the neckline and sleeves are flattering, adding shape to the decolletage. My husband would love this because it’s demure, but a bit flirty, too. 9/10 . Adventurous under-30s willing to show a bit of leg could opt for the Limited Edition skater dress with embellished neckline, £59, (left) while for the all-important Christmas day the velvet dress with sweetheart neckline and lace sleeves has it covered at £45 . BEST FOR THE UNDER THIRTIES . Limited Edition skater dress with embellished neckline, £59 . For a sleeveless dress, this is rather forgiving. The cutaway shoulders are flattering and the pretty neckline draws the eye from any glimpse of the dreaded bingo wings. But while the fabric looks and feels expensive, it is far too short for mature ladies like me. 5/10 . BEST FOR CHRISTMAS DAY . Velvet dress with sweetheart neckline and lace sleeves, £45 . This is what I would describe as a Christmas-y dress because I would be unlikely to wear it at any other time. It just screams festive. And you really can’t beat the warmth of a velvet dress with sleeves. The dress could be an inch shorter — on the knee rather than below. But the sleeves are lovely, and I like the little heart print which is very on-trend. 7/10 . SANDRA’S VERDICT: . M&S has done itself proud! The LBD should fulfil two purposes: to make its wearer feel elegant and chic; and to draw admiring glances. These certainly tick both boxes. I’m overjoyed that most of the new black dresses from M&S come with sleeves, as, like most mature ladies, I don’t usually like to reveal my arms. There are plenty of versatile styles here that could take me from glitzy parties to casual dinners over the next few weeks without breaking the bank. Now there’s just one problem: which LBD to choose?","M&S are offering a range of 60 little black dresses this winter .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . There's no need to be disappointed about this week's news that resveratrol (found in red wine and chocolate) won't help you live longer, as scientists are now championing a different antioxidant in the fight against ageing. Called glutathione, it is molecule produced by the body to fight free radicals. Dr Yannis Alexandrides, a Harley . Street plastic surgeon and founder of a new supplement containing the ingredient, said: 'Glutathione is the body's most powerful . antioxidant and detoxifying agent, but outside the science community, . few people have even heard of it. Beauty boost: Three 111SKIN capsules must be taken a day to stimulating the production of glutathione - which is said to combat the signs of ageing . 'It's now time to raise . awareness on thismolecule that delivers incredible health . benefits, and even helps slow the aging process.' Glutathione has such a powerful regenerative effect on cells, when someone takes a paracetamol overdose and the liver goes into failure, to reverse the effect and ultimately stop them dying, they are given a pure Glutathione drip. But the makers of the new supplement,  111SKIN, have used it to create a product aimed at those who want younger looking skin. Three capsules must be taken a day to stimulate the production of glutathione, with the theory being that the body's cells ability to fight free radical damage is . then strengthened, and the ageing process is delayed. As with much of the 111skin range, the supplement was developed with the help of astronauts. Dr Alexandrides explains: 'My team of scientists . previously worked on the Soviet Space Programme, and their role was to . keep astronauts in orbit in peak health and this meant harnessing the . ability to raise the levels of the most powerful antioxidant in the . body. 111 Skin Radiant Skin Beauty Dose capsules, left, contain Glutathione. It can also be found in fruit and vegetables including avocado . 'They discovered that NAC supplements combined with key vitamins in . their purest form, effectively stimulated the production of glutathione, and they patented their formula unique to 111SKIN.' Dr Alexandrides claims their formula is more effective than other  glutathione supplements currently on the market which have been found to be ineffective when taken orally because it is poorly absorbed and broken down by the stomach. 111SKIN launches at Harrods in August with a bottle of 90 capsules costing £75. In the meantime, it's available via their website 111skin.com. Dr Alexandrides said: 'It's . always been our goal to bring these supplements to a wider market, and . as environmental and lifestyle aggressors increase on earth, we knew . that space would dictate the future for wellbeing.' For those who would rather not take three tablets a day - or shell out £75 for the capsules - but still want to see if they can tackle the signs of ageing with glutathione, simply eat more foods containing the antioxidant. Glutathione can be found in numerous fruit and vegetables including broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, red peppers, avocados, peaches, watermelon and tomatoes.","Glutathione is a molecule produced by the body to fight free radicals .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . He's worked at five star restaurants and cooks for celebrities every weekend on the BBC's Saturday Kitchen but now James Martin has a different target market - dogs. The chef has teamed up with vet and animal nutritionist Marc Abraham to create some canine cordon bleu for man's best friend. And while the dishes, including sweet potato and white fish bake and cheese and kale frittata, might sound elaborate, the accompanying videos reveal that they can be prepared in minutes. Scroll down for video . Canine cordon bleu: James Martin teamed up with vet and animal nutritionist Marc Abraham to create healthy meals for man's best friend . Easy: The cheese and kale frittata can be made in minutes by mixing up the ingredients on the right and then baking . As the ingredients are all ones humans can eat too, Marc points out that you could make the dish for your own dinner and share it with your canine companion. James, who owns two dogs himself, said this is a much better alternative than giving your dog your leftover pizza or curry. He said: 'Have you ever fed your dog leftover food? As if you have, you wouldn't be doing them ever favours whatsoever.' Marc explains: 'It's very important that pet owners pay . attention to their dog’s health needs, particularly with regards to . nutrition. Owners may think they're being kind giving their dog . leftovers, but this could have a detrimental impact on their pet's . health if the wrong foods are given. Clean plates all round: The taste testers loved the frittata . Treats: These muffins can be made so dogs can enjoy baked goods - never give them fruit or chocolate cake . 'We have to give them the right food and exercise to stay healthy - it's simple, like with us.' He added: 'Men are the worst culprits as they feed . pizza and curry to their dogs, female dog owners are more likely to give . casserole left overs with bread. That can contain onion which is toxin . to dogs. Do some research and think carefully about what you feed them.' As Marc and James whip up the meals in the 'K9 Kitchen', the vet also gives some tips on a dog's nutritional needs with some ideas on how changing their diet could enhance other areas of their lives. For instance, did you know that feeding a dog ginger biscuits could prevent them being car sick? Or that giving them pineapple could stop them eating their own dog muck? The recipes include some ingredients that many people perhaps wouldn't consider giving to a dog such as the celebrity favourite food, kale, and the herb rosemary. Meal for two: You could share this sweet potato and white fish bake with your dog . More please! The dogs loved the raspberry muffins . But Marc said kale is great for dogs because it's high in iron and fibre while he adds 'herbs are good for us and they are good for dogs too.' But the pair point out in the video that there are some human foods that should never be given to dogs. Raisins, grapes and chocolate are all toxin to them and can even be fatal. As a result, they point out that fruit and chocolate cake should never be given to dogs. But if you have a passion for baking and want to share the fruits of your labour with your pet, then Marc recommends raspberry muffins made using flax meal, nutritional yeast and natural yoghurt. Other recommended treats for dogs are cheese (in moderation) and carrot sticks. Feet up: The dogs were so keen to wolf down the salad they didn't give themselves time to get down from the sofa before tucking in . Good food for dogs: The ingredients for the tropical chicken salad, left, and raspberry muffins . While the recipes might seem a little overindulgent to create for dogs, they come with a serious message about pet health. Despite being a nation of dog lovers, many Brits could be sending their pets to an early grave thanks to their diet. Processed dog foods have been found to be high in fat, sugar and salt which can cause obesity in dogs and lead to them being in general ill-health. New research published by Direct Line Pet Insurance, who commissioned the K9 Kitchen videos, . reveals that one in five pet owners worry about whether they are . feeding their dogs the right things. A . third of those surveyed (31 per cent) were concerned about their dog's . diet, 68 per cent of whom were worried their pets were not getting the . right nutrition. Edward Barclay, head of pet insurance at Direct Line, commented: 'We receive claims for so many cases of animals suffering from toxic ingestion. Dogs are very much an important member of the family, but foods that are a treat or even healthy to humans, can be very harmful, even lethal to our furry friends. Working with the James and Mark, we hope dog owners up and down the country cook and share these delicious recipes, without it ending in a trip to the vets.' In the videos, Mark points out that the best indicator of your dog's health is their coat - which will be shiny and glossy if they have a good diet. www.directline.com/pet-insurance . When it's raining cats and dogs would you like to be able to keep your pooch dry? Now you can as an umbrella for dogs has been invented. The product, which costs £14.99 from PetShopBowl.co.uk, opens up so it faces down over the dog with an attachment to put on their collar. The owner then holds it over their pet using the handle. Canine capers: Border collie Patch tests the dog umbrella . I put it to the test for Femail with my border collie, Patch. As he's a breed used to being active and outdoors, he's perhaps not the ideal candidate for the product. Patch doesn't care if he gets soaked when out for a walk, he just loves running around outside whatever the weather. But for selfish reasons, keeping him dry means less time spent towelling him off after a walk in the rain and avoids the house smelling of damp dog for hours. No chasing squirrels today: The owner has to hold the umbrella over their pet as they walk . However, as you have to hold the umbrella over the dog, this isn't easy if you have one like Patch who just wants to run around chasing balls and squirrels. Not to mention how ridiculous you look in the process. Perhaps the umbrella would suit rain and exercise adverse dogs who are happy to trot alongside their owners. It's also much better suited to smaller dogs like King Charles spaniel McNulty, pictured below, who can fit completely underneath it. But most will probably agree it's barking mad.

"By . Sean Gallagher for MailOnline . New research has shown the pre-season buzz around Old Trafford has died down somewhat with a drop in confidence towards Louis van Gaal from supporters. Following a disastrous campaign last season, finishing 7th, Van Gaal has been set the task of bringing the glory days back to Old Trafford, but following their opening day defeat to Swansea some fans have raised doubts already. Statistics collected from 160,000 football fans on the Forza Football app has revealed the confidence supporters had in their managers prior to and after their respective opening fixtures. Confidence: Man City showed the highest increase from prior to the season with Sunderland the highest overall . And after 90 per cent optimism from United fans in Van Gaal prior to their season opener against the Swans, things quickly changed as it dropped to 86 per cent following the 2-1 home defeat. Elsewhere other teams who made up the top six last season all showed a marked increase following their opening weekend results, bar Arsenal and Liverpool who despite edging past Crystal Palace and Southampton went down one percent to 86 in the former's case with Liverpool remaining at 85 percent. Manchester City fans showed the biggest increase in confidence towards their manager Manuel Pellegrini with a seven per cent sway after an encouraging opening day victory at Newcastle. Chelsea supporters have continued their unwavered support to Jose Mourinho, as they showed a one per cent rise from 86%. Elsewhere the Everton contingency now have 87 per cent confidence in Roberto Mancini following their 2-2 draw to Leicester as opposed to 85 beforehand. You can Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page here. Disappointing: United fell to a 2-1 home defeat in Louis van Gaal's first game in charge . Surprising: The survey showed a 27 per cent drop in confidence towards Sean Dyche from Burnley fans . Contrasting: Allardyce is under fire from West Ham supporters while Mourinho is adored by the Chelsea faithful . Elsewhere, the highest manager confidence percentage overall is Sunderland with 88% with fans clearly huge supporters of Gus Poyet, who done a superb job last term as they performed the great escape. Way down at the bottom are West Ham, with supporters showing just a 40% manager confidence average in boss Sam Allardyce. There was a two per cent drop in Allardyce from fans following their last-gasp defeat to London rivals Spurs at Upton Park. Perhaps surprisingly Burnley had the biggest drop in confidence following the opening weekend's results, as they were beaten convincingly by Chelsea at Turf Moor. The newly-promoted side showed 89 per cent confidence towards manager Sean Dyche prior to their first game but that soon dropped by 27 per cent after they lost to Chelsea. The biggest surprise of all the findings was perhaps Hull, as after a excellent win at QPR on the opening day, fan manager confidence dropped down three per cent from 87 per cent. Although this could be explained as fans may well be concerned at what Steve Bruce will do in the remaining time left in the transfer market, following the news summer signing Robert Snodgrass faces up to six months on the sidelines with a knee injury.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . They say 'like mother, like daughter', and now new research reveals an unexpected twist to the adage. A poll of 2,000 Brits found that women who cheat are often following in their own mother's illicit footsteps. According to the research, seven out of ten women who cheat on their husbands have mothers who were unfaithful too. A new poll found 'the apple doesn't fall far from from the tree' when it comes to having affairs. Both men and women follow in their parents' footsteps . Many women feel their mother's infidelity gives them 'permission' to cheat - and they consequently take their marriage vows less seriously. Men are also more likely to stray if their fathers were philanderers - but not to the same extent as women. Just 54 per cent of unfaithful men said that cheating ran in the male half of the family. Louise Van der Velde has an open relationship with fiance Mark Howard but says the men she has affairs with often have mums who were cheaters too . The results were revealed in a new poll of 2,000 people who have had affairs by Illicit Encounters, Britain's biggest extra-marital dating site. The poll found that 73 per cent of women who cheated on their partners had mothers who had done the same. And 62 per cent of those female cheats said their mother's infidelity had made it more likely that they would stray, too. Adulteresses feared a backlash from their parents over an affair far less than the offspring of couples who had remained faithful. Just 22 per cent of female cheats said their mother's disapproval would make them give up an affair - compared to 42 per cent for those whose mothers were faithful. A further 32 per cent of female cheats felt their mother's infidelity had give them 'permission' to stray - because the behaviour runs in the family and would not be a surprise. Men also mimic their father's cheating, but to a lesser extent. Just over half of male cheats (54 per cent) said their father's affairs made it more likely that they would have them, too. And 25 per cent of unfaithful men said they would give up affair if their cheating father told them to. The typical female member of Illicit Encounters cheats on their partner THREE times in their first year on the site. Male members cheat slightly less often - at 2.5 times on average. An Illicit Encounters spokesman said: 'If you want to know if your wife will cheat, you may want to take a close look at your mother-in-law. 'Cheating does run in the family, particularly on the female side,' Louise Van der Velde, 40, who is a widower and now engaged to be remarried says the men she's had affairs with often talk to their mums about their illicit relationships . He adds: 'Women idolise their mother as they grow up and follow their good and bad behaviour. 'If their parents divorce or their mother confides in them about previous affairs, women are far more likely to do the same when they marry themselves.' Illicit Encounters member Louise Van der Velde, 40, has had five affairs with married men in her first year on the site. She said the majority of the men she had slept with had parents who were cheats, too. Louise, the widow of a GP, said: 'Cheating runs in the family. Louise's vast experience of having affairs has led her to conclude that cheating runs in the family . 'Sons or daughters of cheats fear the disapproval of their parents far less because they know they have been unfaithful too. 'One of the men I have been seeing is a wealthy banker from Surrey whose mother has been married three times. 'He grew up with her dating a succession of different men and that affected his behaviour as he got older. 'His mother is aware that he cheats on his wife and they have kept the secret between themselves. 'She told him, ""Well, I can hardly start lecturing you after the way I've behaved.""' Louise said that many of her unfaithful female friends had mothers who were adulteresses. She said: 'Some of them tell their mums all about their affairs. They have a good gossip about it. 'In some cases, their mothers are still having affairs anyway – so they are sharing tips on how to keep them secret.' Louise sees men on Illicit Encounters despite being engaged to fiance Mark Howard, 39, a fitness instructor. She said: 'I am completely honest and open with Mark and he understands that I don't think it is normal for a woman to say faithful to the same man for 30 or 40 years. Life really is too short for that.' Mark, who lives with Louise in Camberley, Surrey, said: 'I am fully aware of Louise's lifestyle and don't see anything wrong with it. 'We are completely honest with each other. It is great that there are sites like Illicit Encounters which can accommodate her needs.' Illicit Encounters has seen a 40% increase in registrations in the last two years – largely due to booming house prices. Couples simply cannot afford to divorce and fund two new homes, so they are staying together unhappily and spicing up their marriages with discreet affairs.","73 per cent of adulteresses have mothers who strayed .

The downside of the DASH diet, researchers found, was that the recommended fresh ingredients can be 'somewhat pricey'. An acronym for Dietary Approaches to . Stop Hypertension, the DASH diet advocates fresh produce, whole grains, lean . protein and is low in fat and salt. Developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a free guide assesses how many calories you should be eating according to your age and activity levels. It is the medical community’s most accepted definition of a heart-healthy . diet because it comprises nutrients like potassium, calcium, protein, and fiber that help fight high blood pressure. High fat, sugar and salt foods are off-limits, as is alcohol, but it is otherwise considered vry easy to follow, so good for long-term followers. Experts . found the plan to be best for healthy eating and tied-best for those with diabetes. The site's verdict read: 'Though obscure, it beat out a field full of better-known diets. 'A healthy eating pattern is key to deflating high blood pressure - and it may not hurt your waistline, either.' The TLC diet, also targeting cardiovascular health, came a close second in the best overall diets. An acronym for Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, it was deemed 'a very solid diet plan created by . the National Institutes of Health.' The Mayo Clinic Diet, the Mediterranean Diet and Weight Watchers all took a joint third place. It came as some surprise to see some very popular diets fall in at the bottom of the list. The Paleo Diet (also known as the Caveman Diet) scored just two out of five because 'replicating a caveman-style diet in modern times would be difficult.' The Dukan Diet, beloved of Carole Middleton, came joint-last because it is 'too restrictive, with lots of rules, and there’s no evidence it works.' One expert even described it as 'idiotic.' Among the usual suspects were several new diets, including the Flexitarian Diet, which came in at number six, and the Traditional Asian Diet, which ranked at number 11. The Spark Solution Diet, the Anti-Inflammatory Diet and the Engine 2 Diet were also newcomers to the ranking, but none managed to make it into the top ten. 1. DASH DIET . SCORE: 4.1 out of 5 stars .

"By . Ruth Styles . It might sound like something from a science fiction novel but technicians at beauty giant L'Oréal claim to have unearthed the secret of thicker hair - in the garage. According to experts working for the brand, filloxane, an ingredient used in an upcoming haircare range, works like silica gel which is used to fix cracks in car windscreens. Named 'sol-gel' technology by its creators, the thickener works by inserting itself into the hair shaft, bulking it up from within. The dream: Eight million British women suffer from thinning hair but filloxane could be the solution . By contrast, conventional hair thickeners work by coating the outside of the hair strand and can only manage temporary results. The new technology, which could offer a . solution to the estimated eight million British women who complain of . having thinning hair and hits the shelves as part of L'Oréal's new Elvive Fibrology range this month, has even received a cautious welcome from hair experts. Speaking to the Sunday Times,  Franz Wortmann, a professor of fibre and textile technology at Manchester University, described the new wonder ingredient as a 'breakthrough'. He added: 'What makes it interesting from a chemical point of view is that they have produced this glass-like three dimensional structure that gets into the hair because it is positively charged and hair is negatively charged, so it sticks there.' Sealant: Filloxane works in a similar way to silica gel which is commonly used to fix cracked car windscreens . According to data released by L'Oréal, using a shampoo with a 10 per cent concentration of filloxane could expand individual hair strands by 60 per cent - an effect that remained for a further 10 washes. But it seems that not everyone is convinced. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Des Tobin, the head of the centre for skin sciences at Bradford University, said: . 'It would be difficult to see how the highly compact nature of the hair cortex could tolerate an expansion equal to 62 per cent. 'A key measure would be to see a side-by-side comparison of the hair fibre before and after treatment.' It might not have the eye-catching technology but if the claims are to be believed, all-natural British brand, Swell, could give limp locks an equally impressive boost. The new range, which launches at Marks & Spencer this week, contains Peruvian maca, which has been clinically proven to stimulate growth by a massive 93 per cent, all while protecting it from environmental stress and reducing hair loss. Swell products also contain blue lupin, which helps lock in colour, and Swiss apple, an old-fashioned fruit thought to increase hair growth and reduce loss by 50 per cent. Speaking about the brand, the famously fine-haired Tennant said: 'I like using natural products on my hair and Swell’s volumising system makes my hair fuller, thicker and stronger naturally as well as smelling divine.' And she's not the only celebrity fan of the range, which includes shampoo, £23, conditioner, £26, and 'Root Nutrient Complex', a £30 volumising styling spray. Model, athlete and TV presenter Jenny Pacey, is also a fan and says it has given her fine hair an impressive boost. 'I have struggled with fine thin hair for my entire life. After using the Swell 3-step system for 3 months my hair feels fuller, thicker, and has been left in incredible condition.'","Filloxane inserts itself into the hair shaft, bulking from within .

"By . Ruth Styles . From plank hats to frilly hotpants, London's leading platform for men's fashion is no stranger to the bizarre ensemble. But designer Astrid Andersen took things a step further when she sent models down the catwalk in neoprene mankinis. The unusual two-pieces were joined by billowing printed capes in an array of zany hues, flowing silk board shorts, crop tops and even, for one poor model, a fringed bodycon dress. Others sported strapless dresses, cut just below the nipple, which came in bright fluorescent pink, high viz orange, subtle black and a pretty shade of cobalt blue. Unusual look: Models sporting strapless dresses by designer Astrid Andersen hit the runway on day one of London Collections: Men .

Floaty: A model in a billowing cape strides down the catwalk at Astrid Andersen . Sporty: A model in a sheer mesh top and cycling shorts, and a cropped jacket on the catwalk . All dressed up: A model shows off a fringed neoprene dress at Astrid Andersen . And Anderson wasn't the only one bent on raising eyebrows. At Hentsch Man, models sporting candy stripes and summer brights chomped on cigars as they posed on the catwalk during the presentation. Then, at Lou Dalton, a distinctly feminine palette took centre stage with cleverly cut jackets in coral teamed with shorts that finished just above the knee, and a delicate pale pink parachute silk blouse. Equally quirky were the offerings at MAN, a show designed to showcase the best of London's up-and-coming creative talent, where wacky masks, a skin-tight all-in-one and a Mounties costume all took centre stage. Luckily for the models at London Collection: Men, which opened in the capital today, not every designer was bent on making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Also on the runway today were pieces by Topman, where creative director Gordon Richardson took an more tailored approach to menswear, showing beautifully cut suits in delicate summer pastels.

Happily for those not yet ready to be prised away from their black, Richardson followed up with wideboy suits in charcoal and black, teamed with chunky knits emblazoned with zig-zags, and wearable black and grey striped Henleys. There was one less than sharp addition however. Watched by a starry front row that included Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw, model Jourdan Dunn and fellow clothes horse Oliver Cheshire, every look was accessorised with bright white trainers. It was a rare dose of sportiness in what was otherwise a collection aimed wholly at the dapper gent, who is certainly not the sort of chap who would shop at Superdry - the big name brand which got London Collections: Men off to a star-studded start last night. Here, sports-casual dominated with khaki board shorts and scruffy-cool camouflage vests taking to the runway in front of a dapper crowd that included actor Jesse Metcalfe and model David Gandy.

"By . Deni Kirkova . Chunky men everywhere will be delighted to hear that British women have redefined the classic 'hunk', with recent research revealing they prefer their men 'real' - with a little more wobble than muscle. Now Amanda Holden is heading up a campaign to find the UK's tastiest real-life hunk - and, if the research is to be believed, they might not be your stereotypical Adonis. The study reveals that one in five UK women actively lust after cuddly men with a little extra padding around the middle. In fact, contrary to popular belief, just 10 per cent of women like their men broad and muscular. Clean shaven and muscly isn't most British women's cup of tea - one in five likes extra padding . As well as cuddly love handles, more than third of women (33 per cent) prefer men with hairy chests. And less than 10 per cent of British women like the clean-shaven look. Four in ten devoted ladies said their own man possesses the ideal body. Yoghurt brand Oykos worked with psychologists to measure the fluttering heart rates and clammy palms of women when shown a variety of hunky male body types. Amanda Holden and Oykos will celebrate real-life hunks of all shapes and sizes by sculpting them . Dr Simon Moore, Chartered Psychologist says: 'Body types traditionally viewed as ""ideal"" rated more attractive for short-term relationships. But the research revealed that men with cuddly bodies rated most attractive to women seeking long-term relationships, due to their perceived 'humour, intelligence, honesty and kind-nature.' Having . searched the country high and low for special people on Britain's Got Talent, Amanda . Holden now partners with Oykos to judge the real-life hunk competition. It's a tough job, but someone's got to do it, eh Amanda? Slightly surreally, Oykos plan to immortalise winners as . dessert spoon sculptures. Amanda . Holden says: 'I'm used to looking for talent, but searching the nation . for hunks is a whole new ballgame! I need you, the women of the UK, to . nominate your man, whatever his shape or size! 'And I’ll turn his torso . into a tasty spoon, so you can dunk your hunk whenever you fancy!' Having searched the country for real British talent, Amanda now judges a different type of competition . An Oykos spokesperson said: 'It’s wonderful to see women across the UK are redefining ’hunk’ as real-life men at home, not just the celebrities and models we so often see in the media. 'It’s great that 40 per cent of women believe their man represents their ideal body type and we would like to encourage women to celebrate their hunks at home by nominating them to be immortalised as a delicious dessert spoon.'

"By . Bianca London . As obesity rates soar across the UK, one health store think they have the answer to our weightloss woes. Superdrug is launching the first set of scales which replace the dreaded stones and kilos with celebrity comparisons, in a bid to alleviate Brits of their weighty worries. The calibrated scales highlight celebrities who fall between eight and 18 stone, and feature celebrities . including Rihanna, Cheryl Cole, Khloe Kardashian, Gemma Collins and the Duchess of . Cambridge. Due to be tested in stores this week, Superdrug say the aim of the scales is to help bring down the barriers that stop people talking about and managing their weight effectively. A whole new weight game: Forget pounds, stones and kilos, you can now weight yourself in comparison to celebrities . Stepping . onto them allows users to gauge their weight relative to that of several celebrities, . so instead of weighing 9st 2lb, they're able to claim they . weigh between a Beyonce and a Rihanna. Cheryl Cole, at 8st is the celebrity at the lightest end of the scales, Khloe Kardashian occupies the mid range at 12st 11lb and Queen Latifa - 14st - and Melissa McCarthy - estimated at 18st - are at the higher end. Do you weigh Beyonce? Now you can emulate your favourite A-listers via these scales . Weighing in: Weigh 9st 6lb? No you don't, you weigh between Beyonce and Rihanna, according to Superdrugs' new scales . The scales were produced in response . to new research which reveals that losing weight is an ongoing concern . for over 60 per cent of the UK population, with 40 per cent admitting to . avoiding bathroom scales altogether for fear of seeing the . result. Cheryl Cole - 8st . Kate Middleton - 8st 6lb . Jessica Ennis - 8st 9lb . Ellie Goulding - 9st . Beyonce - 9st 4lb . Rihanna - 9st 7lb . Christina Hendricks - 11st . Khloe Kardashian - 12st 1lb . Adele - 14st . Queen Latifa - 14st . Gemma Collins - 16st . Melissa McCarthy - estimate 18st . Additionally, almost one in three (29 per cent) of us admit being unhappy with our current weight at any given time. The findings also revealed that thinking about weight is a daily preoccupation for over a quarter . of the UK (26 per cent). It's women who think most about it, with 16 per cent claiming . to think about their weight more than three times every day, compared to . just four per cent of men. The research also reveals the . lengths to which people would go to not reveal their true weight. Some 40 per cent . will not discuss their weight with family or friends, and 12 per cent of us admit . to not even divulging our truthful weight to healthcare professionals. And when pushed to state what they weigh, 60 per cent of Brits will claim to be . at least half a stone lighter than they actually are. In . fact, so reticent are Brits to talk about their weight that they prefer to tell others how much alcohol they drink (48 per cent), their salary . (18 per cent) the debt they're in (10 per cent), the number of sexual partners they've . had (10 per cent) or their pin number (two per cent). Body confidence: The scales, which feature Melissa McCarthy, left, and the Duchess of Cambridge, right, were produced in response to research revealing that losing weight is a concern for over 60 per cent of the UK . Which celebrity weight are you? You'll be Khloe Kardashian if you weigh around 12st 1lb, and TOWIE's Gemma Collins if your weight is roughly 16st . A spokesperson for Superdrug said: 'Our new scales are just one of the ways that the health team here are helping our customers to be more open about discussing their health needs with our in store healthcare professionals. 'We're pleased to be piloting these scales amongst our store teams and, if successful, would look at potentially rolling them out for customer use nationwide.' A spokesman for eating disorder charity BEAT told MailOnline: 'This type of exploitation of the most toxic aspect of celebrity culture is just wrong in so many ways. 'Of course many people are concerned about maintaining a healthy weight, but inviting a spurious comparison with another person’s supposed weight doesn't help anyone.' Bristol (23 per cent happy)Cardiff (19 per cent happy)London (17 per cent happy)Bradford (16 per cent happy)Coventry (15 per cent happy) Liverpool (20 per cent unhappy)Leeds (18 per cent unhappy)Nottingham (16 per cent unhappy)Glasgow (16 per cent unhappy)Manchester (15 per cent unhappy) A-list weights: The scales will show you as a Jessica Ennis if you weight around 8st 9lb and 14st women are an Adele . Lorna Driver-Davies nutricentre.com nutritionist said:'I am very concerned with the concept of celebrity weighing scales. As a nutritionist I have no objection to women weighing themselves in kg - this is commonplace on normal scales and many women choose the metric method of weight – for example in France and Germany. 'Comparing your weight to anyone - your friends, sister or colleagues would be a very unhealthy way to judge your own weight – so a comparison to celebrities is even worse. 'These scales do not take into account body fat percentage, height, BMI, waist and hip measurements and common sense on what is a healthy weight for an individual. 'Not only is this concept deeply unscientific but also I believe it would encourage even more insecurity and anxiety about weight which is a sad situation. 'These scales also set a very poor example to teenage girls who are often more susceptible to eating disorders and are easily impressed by celebrity status.'","Duchess of Cambridge, Khloe Kardashian and Kim Kardashian .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A five-year-old girl who was told she may never be able to walk or even crawl due to a rare chromosome disorder has proved doctors wrong by running for the first time unaided. Eden Nagle's mother, Michelle, 32, shows in a short film titled Don't Give Up how the brave youngster from Idaho overcame her bleak diagnosis through physical therapy sessions and lots of determination. At the beginning of the film Eden is seen on a treadmill wearing leg braces, then on Christmas morning, aged two, she appears crawling. Eventually at the end, after a few wobbles and falls, she ecstatically jogs outside in sneakers. Scroll down for video . Super girl! Five-year-old Eden Nagle was told she may never be able to walk or even crawl due to a rare chromosome disorder - but she has proved doctors wrong by standing on her own two feet unaided . In another shot uploaded to Mrs . Nagle's Facebook page, Eden appears wearing a Supergirl costume, . defiantly standing up with one arm punching the air. Her mother writes: 'She has no idea how appropriate this costume really is. Love this girl (my real life super hero).' Mrs Nagle and her husband Tim, 36, first realized something was wrong with Eden around five to six . months after her birth, when she wasn't trying to sit and crawl, and she . had difficulty keeping her head up. One step at a time: Eden Nagle's mother, Michelle, shows in a short film how the brave youngster from Idaho overcame her bleak diagnosis through physical therapy sessions and lots of determination . One the move: On Christmas morning, aged two, Eden crawls for the first time . 'We also noticed that she wasn't . really interested in toys and seemed to have a hard time seeing things. Her eyes seemed to be crossing quite a bit,' Mrs Nagle told MailOnline. Doctors said that the infant had low muscle tone, but unable to give a diagnosis they directed the family to a genetic testing lab. 'Eden fell often but would always smile, get back up and try again. She . is our hero and the beautiful reminder to never give up' It was there that specialists . noticed Eden had a deletion in her first chromosome, which could cause . some developmental delays. They said that she may never be able to walk. She was also diagnosed with Duane syndrome, a rare, congenital eye movement disorder, which means she doesn't have peripheral vision. When Eden was eight months old she started physical therapy and took many sessions in the water. She was later fitted with braces on her feet that went up to her ankles, allowing her to work with a reverse walker. Making progress: The youngster used a walking frame when she was a toddler to get along . Come to daddy! Eden walks unaided towards her father, Tim, who cannot hide his delight . Now, five years on she is able to walk and even run without a walker. Her mother says that balance is still a struggle and uneven surfaces or stairs are most difficult. Mrs Nagle lost her first daughter, Lyla, 23 minutes after her birth in 2007, because of a condition called anencephaly which meant she was missing the majority of her brain and skull. Eden . was born a year later. Asked if she would like more children Mrs Nagle . said: 'Possibly. We have talked about this a number of times and haven't . said yes or no. 'It's hard . to know how things will develop as Eden gets older. We've talked about . possibly adopting, but we are waiting to see how life unfolds.' Strong-willed: When specialists first discovered . Eden had a deletion in her first chromosome, they said she might never . be able to walk . Warning signs: It wasn't until Eden was around five or six months old that the Nagles realized that something was wrong and doctors directed them to a genetic testing lab . Luckily the family have been eligible for Medicaid, which has helped fund Eden's treatment. Along with physical therapy she has also needed training to help with her speech. Mrs Nagle concludes in the Vimeo film: 'Eden fell often but would always smile, get back up and try again. 'She is our hero and the beautiful reminder to find joy in the little things, love others, laugh often, be strong and never give up. 'We hope that Eden can encourage you that whatever your struggle might be... keep going, smile, you are loved, you are not alone, don't give up.'","Eden Nagle from Idaho has a deletion in her first chromosome and was diagnosed with Duane syndrome .

"By . Ruth Styles . and Lucy Waterlow . Once, being a WAG was simply a matter of looking good in a frock and finding a footballer to marry you. Not any more. Today's variety are a very different breed, with some so high powered that their career eclipses that of their sporty other half. Leading the pack are platinum selling songstress, Shakira - who is Colombia's answer to Beyonce - and supermodel Irina Shayk. They've forged their own careers and amassed such personal fortunes that they will never need to be financially reliable on their rich footballer boyfriends. And they are not alone. From top rank journalists to actresses, models and chart-topping singers, the WAGs arriving in Rio for this year's World Cup have far more than just shopping on their minds. Scroll down for video . Supermodel: Irina on the catwalk at Sao Paulo Fashion Week, left, and wearing an outfit to ensure all eyes were on her on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival . No need to spend his fortune: The model is just as successful as her boyfriend Cristiano Ronaldo, who she pictured with right . IRINA SHAYK - SUPERMODEL . One of the best-known of the WAGs heading to the World Cup, the 28-year-old model, who hails from the town of Yemanzhelinsk on Russia's border with Kazakhstan, shot to fame in 2010 when she starred in the video for Kanye West's Power. Since then, the model's career has gone from strength to strength with shoots for Sports Illustrated, Harper's Bazaar and Elle, as well as campaigns for Intimissimi and Lacoste. Irina, who has been in a relationship with Real Madrid and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo, 29, since 2010, recently appeared in a Mario Testino shoot for Spanish Vogue and will co-star with The Rock in a remake of Hercules due out later this year. SHAKIRA - MEGASTAR . Singer Shakira is a global star having sold more than 70 million albums worldwide and won numerous accolades including two Grammy Awards. Success in the UK came with her album Laundry Service, featuring the song Whenever, Wherever, and Underneath Your Clothes. She later scored number one singles with Hips Don't Lie and Beautiful Liar, performed with Beyonce. The 37-year-old first met Gerard Piqué, 27, when filming the video for her 2010 World Cup song, Waka Waka.

She was was once voted the world's sexiest journalist by FHM and her good looks caused controversy at the last World Cup when her pitch-side reporting was said to be too much of a distraction for her boyfriend - causing his team to suffer a surprise 1-0 defeat against Switzerland. Earlier this year, the couple celebrated the arrival of their first child, a 'much desired son' they named Martin. Distraction?

"By . Bianca London . Remember the term 'Normcore'? We reported on it a couple of months ago - the bland fashion uniform consisting of plain . tees, comfortable shoes, understated anoraks and dad jeans? Just . got your fuzzy fashion head around that? Well sorry to break it to you, . but it's already old news in the fast-paced and fickle world of . fashion, where buzzwords come and go quicker than you can say Cara . Delevingne. The latest trend to be embracing? That would be #CozyGirl, which comes complete with a hashtag because it originated on Instagram, where fashion's elite set the seasonal trends. New trend: The latest style craze to sweep social media is the #CozyGirl trend, which Cara Delevingne models to perfection (think joggers, comfy T-shirts and trainers) #CozyGirl involves combining streetwear with comfy pyjama style clothes - think cashmere jumpers, sweatpants and trainers or pool sliders. It takes the sportswear trend a step further and the trendsetters are pairing grey jogging bottoms with slouchy T-shirts and jumpers and slipping on Saucony trainers (the only footwear to be seen in this season). Refinery 29's Bobby Schuessler, who spotted the trend, said: 'They live life on the corner where fashion and comfort meet. And, with the rise of high-concept sweatpants, slides, pullovers, and more in the women’s space, it seems the #cozygirl movement is on the rise.' Speaking about the trend, MailOnline's resident fashion blogger, Simon Glazin, said: 'I absolutely love this look, it's cool, effortless and can actually be quite chic. Look to Victoria Beckham with her various looser fit trousers, relaxed T-shirts and waterfall, sleeveless jackets. She wore a couple of looks like this which were uber comfy and cool. Get the look: The trend aims to merge fashion and comfort and consists of sweatpants, slides, trainers and pullovers; Asos is stocked with everything you need to pull it off . Smartening up: Miranda Kerr rocked elasticated waistband joggers in her H&M campaign but added heels and a blazer to take her look from day to night . 'However you have to make sure you don't become a fashion victim. We don't actually want to see your pyjamas, and make sure if you are going out head-to-toe in slouchy pieces you give yourself some shape - maybe tuck in your Tee or shirt? Simple but makes a difference. 'There are lots of cosy chic looks from the catwalks of late. Vionnet for SS14 styled up a gorgeous maxi skirt with a plain white T-shirt. Blake Lively rocked this exact look at Cannes earlier this year. 'Elasticated waists are now OK. They are no longer just reserved for old age homes. Try a pair of heels with joggers for a fierce-girl look, for instance. It's all about having a bit of fun with your wardrobe, and trying to look like you haven't tried at all!' Fresh off the runway: George at Asda's AW14 show, left, sent models down the catwalk in a #CozyGirl coat, while Very.co.uk are going cosy crazy this season . Style blogger Toni Jones, founder of 30ishStylist.com, is yet to be convinced. She said: 'Recently I bought a pair of sports luxe ""cosy girl"" joggers from H&M, as seen on Miranda Kerr in the billboard campaign. Miranda looked hot to trot in her loose pants and heels. I appeared to gain two stone the second I put them on. And this is my problem with ""cosy"" fashion wear - you need to be stunning and super slim to make it look cool. 'I'm a big fan of dressing according to your shape and most of these clothes assume we have no shape, which is pretty unrealistic at best and complete fashion snobbery at worst. 'I like - and wear - some of the simple pieces worn with something a bit more glamorous that will work harder for me and my hips, but as a rule I vote that #CozyGirl should stay under the duvet where she belongs.'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . TV presenter Natalie Verney was delighted to give birth to twin girls last October but her only regret was that she wasn't able to express her happiness with a beaming smile. The Channel 5 newsreader was 32 weeks pregnant with her daughters, Seren Rose and Sienna Mai, when she was suddenly struck with Bell's palsy. The condition causes paralysis in one of side of the face so the Oxfordshire-born journalist went from reading the news on national television one afternoon to not being able to move her lips properly the next. Sudden development: Natalie Verney went from presenting the Channel 5 news one day to being unable to move one side of her face after the onset of Bell's palsy . She told MailOnline: 'I woke up one day to find the left side of my mouth wasn't working properly. I only noticed when I went to drink my morning cup of tea and it dribbled down my chin. When I looked in the mirror I found my smile was crooked and I couldn't pucker my lips. 'Panicking, I ran to the doctors where I was told, ""Don't worry, you're not having a stroke but you do need to go to A&E immediately."" 'Two hours later at the hospital and after a number of tests, I was dealt the news that I had Bell's palsy.' For the next six weeks, Natalie couldn't fully close one of her eyes, eat and drink properly and her attempt to smile was more of a sneer. With the imminent arrival of her daughters with husband Tim, instead of being overwhelmed with excitement for their birth, she worried that her newborns would be terrified of her appearance. Ordeal: When the symptoms were the worst, Natalie was unable to fully close one eye, eat or drink properly or smile . She explains: 'The most upsetting part of it for me was losing my smile. With only half my mouth moving in the right . direction my smile looked more like some grotesque sneer. I was so self . conscious I became a recluse and didn't leave my house, except for . hospital appointments, for two months. 'What should have been an exciting . time turned into some of the darkest days of my life. My baby girls . were going to be born and all I could think about was the fact I . wouldn't be able to smile at them when I saw them for the first time. I . was even worried my face would scare them.' She added: 'I don't have any photos of me . smiling with my newborn babies and that makes me really sad.' '... I have no idea why I got it or what caused it and nor do the doctors. It's frustrating' The symptoms of Bell's palsy can vary from a mild numbness of the face to total paralysis. For some, the paralysis is temporary and in most cases will improve after two to three weeks without treatment. In others, it can take up to a year  to make a full recovery with the aid of steroids and physiotherapy. Natalie was aware of the condition as her sister had come down with a mild case of it when she had given birth to her third child three years ago. Figures suggest that pregnant women are three times more likely to get it than anyone else, but it's not clear why. The NHS state on their website that it occurs when the nerve that controls the facial muscles becomes inflamed or compressed. But they add: 'It is not known what causes the facial nerve to become inflamed, although it is thought that a virus, possibly a herpes virus, may be responsible.' Natalie said doctors were baffled why she developed it when she did and she has unsuccessfully searched the internet for definite answers. She said: 'The medical profession doesn't seem to really understand what causes it. Everything I know about the condition is through my own research. Bitter sweet: Natalie was delighted to become a mother to Seren Rose and Sienna Mai but sad she couldn't properly smile at them at first . 'There are lots of theories out there - many people claim they were very stressed before they came down with the condition, meanwhile Chinese medicine believes sleeping next to a fan or driving with an open window can bring it on. 'For me, Bell's palsy came out of the blue. I was enjoying a healthy straightforward twin pregnancy. The babies were growing really well and I hadn't even suffered from morning sickness. I had been happily working and enjoying the hot summer we had last year and I was looking forward to a few weeks of rest before my girls arrived into the world. I have no idea why I got it or what caused it and nor do the doctors. It's frustrating.' Eight months on, following acupuncture and sessions with a physiotherapist who specialises in facial palsy at The Face Place at Southampton Hospital, Natalie's symptoms have improved. She said: 'When I look back at photos of my face . when the Bell's palsy was at it's worst, I can appreciate how remarkable . my recovery has been up to now. I'm not fully recovered though. I . currently have about 70 per cent of movement back but it's getting better all . the time. Gorgeous girls: The twins have helped Natalie deal with Bell's palsy and take her mind off the condition . 'It took six months for me to be able to fully close my eye . again - that was such a relief. My blink is back too but it's just a bit . slower than my right eye at the moment. My smile has improved . enormously - it does at least look like a smile these days - but it's . still wonky and that's probably the thing I'm most self conscious about. 'People tell me that if they didn't know me before, they wouldn't know . anything had happened to my face which is reassuring, but I still really . really hope I get my full smile back one day.' Not only does she want her daughters to see her full smile, it's also important to her in resuming her career in front of the cameras after her maternity leave. She said: 'I completed my last shift on 5 News on the Saturday and my Bell's palsy hit on the Monday. In a way I was lucky as I had literally just started my maternity leave so I didn't need to cancel any work. 'I felt nervous about telling Channel 5 about what had happened as I work for them on a freelance basis and I know how fickle the world of television can be. But they have been very supportive and told me to take as much time as I need and to give them a ring when I'm ready to go back. 'As I'm freelance my maternity leave can be as long as I'd like it . to be, which is lucky as I had originally intended to go back to work . after six months. Unfortunately, my face hadn't recovered enough - . that was a decision I made, not Channel 5. I didn't feel confident . enough to face the camera again. So I'm just enjoying my babies while my . face recovers and when I feel ready I'll get back out there.' '... my gorgeously funny little babies are the reason I have got through this' In the meantime, Natalie said she loves being a full-time mother at her home in Buckinghamshire. 'They are the best thing that's ever . happened to me,' she said. 'They are the most gorgeously funny little babies and I'm . so proud of them. When I was struggling in my final trimester and I was . very down with the Bell's at it's worst, I was really worried that I'd . get post natal depression after they were born, but in actual fact they . are the reason I have got through this. 'Not only do they bring joy to me . every day but they have given me something else to focus on. The first few months were just a whirlwind, I've never . been so busy! It really helped because I couldn't worry about my face . even if I wanted to - I didn't have a minute to spare!' Natalie has shared her story in the hope it will help other sufferers of the condition that affects about one in 5,000 people a year. She said: 'Unfortunately there will be other pregnant women out there who will be suffering from Bell's palsy right now. In the early days of the condition I was desperate to find someone else who had experienced it during pregnancy but I couldn't find any information anywhere. 'If my story can help anyone going through those awful first few weeks or months of the condition in any way then I'll be happy. Recovering: The journalist's symptoms have improved and she's enjoying her maternity leave . 'There's also a fantastic charity called Facial Palsy UK that I'd advise anyone suffering from Bell's to contact. On their website (www.facialpalsy.org.uk) there is a wealth of information for sufferers and I wish I'd known about them at the beginning.' Facial Palsy UK is a charity dedicated to helping people affected by all types of facial paralysis. They have been working hard to develop a support network of mothers who have developed Bell's palsy during pregnancy or around the time of giving birth. Psychologist professor Nichola Rumsey, . co-director of the Centre for Appearance Research in Bristol is a member . of the Medical Advisory Board of Facial Palsy UK said: 'The . psychological and social challenges resulting from facial palsy can be . considerable. People's daily lives can be negatively affected in many . ways. There is an urgent need to develop much more effective ways of . offering appropriate support.' Vanessa Venables, principal speech and language therapist, co-founder and Trustee of Facial Palsy UK added: 'It is a time when new mums or mums-to-be need high quality advice, information, support and encouragement. It is a time when they may feel vulnerable and least able to help themselves and therefore it’s vitally important for the professionals involved to have the correct advice, information and support at their fingertips. 'Sadly in my experience this has not been the case.  Apart from the immediate medical management scant attention has been paid to the needs of these women who are left to fend for their newborn child and family without important help and advice.'

"By . Katy Winter . Meet Rebekah Tiler, Britain’s strongest schoolgirl who can lift almost 20st.

Rebekah said: 'I started weightlifting when I was 12. I was a sprinter and as part of my training I was tested for strength. 'My trainer couldn’t believe how strong I was and encouraged me to take up weight lifting. 'I started lifting around 40kg to practice technique and I went from there. 'I competed in and won my first weightlifting contest when I was 12, I even beat the boys.

'I’ve broken over 200 records, a lot of them my own but no-one has beat me yet.' Rebekah’s mother Emma said Rebekah has shown a natural strength from a young age. She said: 'Even when she was a baby she was advanced for her age, she learnt to walk and pull herself up much quicker than other children her age. 'Her dad Chris always did weights and had weights around the house, so she’d always have a go at lifting his dumbells.

"By . Bianca London . Since Spain's King Juan Carlos abdicated his throne, all eyes have been on the country's most glamorous new Queen - Letizia. The . 41-year-old, who is married to Prince Felipe, has earned her spot as . one of the world's most stylish royals thanks to her impeccable wardrobe choices - and she's even managed to knock the once favoured Duchess of Cambridge from her top spot. And it's not just in the sartorial stakes that Queen Letizia is reigning. One gem hunter says that while both brunettes are fashion icons who hail from a middle-class background, the similarities end when it comes to the biggest indulgence of royal life - jewellery. Spot the difference: A gem expert says that the Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Queen Letizia's jewellery reveals that their choices are telling of huge personal and cultural differences between the two . Kings and queens have always showcased their status with the help of a jewel or two. Steve Bennett, gem hunter and founder of The Genuine Gemstone Company, believes our modern royals should continue this tradition. Casting his expert eye over Kate and Letizia’s sparkly accessories, Steve reveals that their jewellery choices are telling of huge personal and cultural differences between the two. He said: 'As stunning women who can afford to inject colour into her jewellery, Letizia confidently embraces vibrancy and variety, whereas Kate is rarely without her conventional pearls or diamonds. 'In fact, the Spanish royal family combine colour and drama in a way that seems alien to the more conservative Kate. Simple versus extravagant: The Duchess is looking very much the English Rose, assuming a more traditional style than her adventurous counterpart, right, who lets her jewels take centre stage . 'An outsider would be forgiven for mistaking Kate as the princess enduring Spain’s current economic crisis - the absence of a statement necklace is more credit crunch than royal lunch. Rival Letizia shows us how to pair a tiara with vibrant magenta gems in the true style of a queen.' Undoubtedly the best-known item in Kate's jewellery collection is her engagement ring, which once belonged to Princess Diana. The blue sapphire, which sparkles with 14 diamonds, was bought at the former Crown jewellers Garrard of Mayfair for a staggering £28,500. When it comes to choosing her own accessories, Kate does, however, prefer more simple pieces like her £1,090 Annoushka Pearl Drop earrings and more modest £275 Links Hope earrings. She's even a fan of cheap but chic jewellery which she snapped up from Made . In Chelsea star Amber Atherton's myflashtrash website, which she wore while on her Diamond Jubilee tour of the . South Pacific. Wearing it with confidence: He believes that Queen Letizia wears her jewellery with the confidence gained during her colourful career as a journalist and her smile is as gleaming as her emeralds and showcases Spanish vitality to the world . Queen Letizia, however, is hardly . ever spotted without her Cartier diamond bracelet, which can cost in . excess of £25,000, as well as her favourite Bulgari Parentesi ring, . which can cost around £10,000. Steve goes on to explain that Letizia . lets her jewels take centre stage whilst Kate is keen not to shock, . adding that Letizia’s fashion forward choice of gemstones in daring . shades, worn with the confidence gained during her colourful career as a . journalist, is a 'breath of fresh air'. The . Duchess, meanwhile, is very much the English Rose, assuming a . more traditional style than her adventurous counterpart, he says. Cheap and chic: Amber Atherton and her team were thrilled to discover that Kate was a keen supporter of British jewellery .

"By . Katy Winter . Missionary has given way to the cowgirl, meaning British men are now very kindly allowing their partners to do more of the graft . Tradition has it that the British man is no good in bed. Lazy, timid and unadventurous, his most daring sexual exploits are leaving the lights on and the occasional removal of his socks. However, a new survey commissioned exclusively for Esquire magazine’s 'Not Safe For Work' Issue reveals that the British man of today is a decidedly different creature: creative, confident – perhaps even cocky – and always up for a challenge. Esquire asked 500 men across the UK about their thoughts, habits and desires when it came to sex and the results are surprisingly reassuring. More than half of British men (56 per cent) think they’re good – or very good – in bed, with Londoners the most likely to say so (65 per cent). Those who dwell in the capital also masturbated most often. As far as sexual positions go, missionary has been overtaken on popularity by the cowgirl (31 per cent), meaning British men are now very kindly allowing their partners to do more of the graft. One in four British men have even tried bondage for the first time in the last 12 months, reports Esquire, suggesting it’s not only female Kindle owners who are surreptitiously flicking through 50 Shades of Grey. The British man is now also thinking outside the bedroom, with a bold 54 per cent of men having had sex in a public space, while almost of quarter of British men (23 per cent) admitted to Esquire that they’d received oral sex while driving, bringing a whole new meaning to the term hard shoulder. British men have shaken off their former badge of being lazy and unadventurous in bed . And before you consider crashing on a friend’s sofa after a heavy night, bear in mind that 38 per cent of men admitted that the last place they’d had sex other than their bed was on the living room sofa. British men are also very happy to self-service – more than one in five British men (21 per cent) masturbate at least once a day, while half of British men (50 per cent) watch porn at least once a week, the Esquire survey reveals. One in four British men watch it every day. Esquire Editor in Chief Alex Bilmes says, 'It’s great to see British men are no longer sad sacks in the sack, but are full of confidence, enthusiasm and a sense of sexual adventure. Presumably it’s all the invaluable advice they’ve been receiving from the pages of Esquire, available every month from all self-respecting newsagents.'","Over one in five British men masturbate at least once a day .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . Pretty. Beautiful. Perfect. If you want to get an idea of how good Kurt Coleman really is, just ask him. The self-proclaimed 'most famous teenager in Australia' has more than 170,000 followers on Facebook and nearly 85,000 on Instagram. He told a national television audience he was Australia's answer to Paris Hilton. 'She's my inspiration, she's just like me, that's why I love her,' he said. His social media accounts are teaming full of unashamedly self-indulgent photos of the 17-year-old Gold Coast boy, who also claims to be the inspiration behind Beyonce Knowles' hit Flawless. Scroll down for video . Adulation: More than 170,000 people follow Kurt Coleman and his self-love on Facebook . Confident or cocky?

'People are really jealous of me, I can understand why, and I'll never change for anyone because I love myself.' He said he takes selfies '24/7 because I love what I see in the camera'. Rising star: Kurt wants to host his own TV show and recently signed on to a regular segment on Australian chat show Studio 10 . Target: Kurt said he is regularly singled out by 'haters' wanting to bash him . His jaw-dropping popularity has spawned a mini-industry, with businesses set up in Australia flogging Kurt Coleman-related merchandise. The Kurt Coleman Supply Company says on its website it exists to promote 'the poster-boy to thousands of youth around the world for being who you are and not caring what anyone else thinks.' 'It's so funny, I can't believe it really,' Kurt told MailOnline. 'It's ridiculous, they're making money off my face, I'm going to get around to getting money out of them.' Selfie fan: The Gold Coast sensation says he takes selfies '24/7' because he likes what he sees . The supremely-confident teenager said people approach him in the street 'every single day, sometimes it's scary, I have to run sometimes...I've been hit so many times.' Asked if his online profile was an invented character or if he really does love himself, Kurt replied: 'I do, I love who I am, I don't think it's wrong. 'I think everyone should think they're pretty, it's literally OK to hate yourself these days.' He said his confidence was not hiding any insecurities, adding: 'I do love myself.' It's a tough life .

'We had to report it because of the language,' she told MailOnline. 'This was at 1 or 2 in the morning, nuisance calls, they couldn't believe he didn't live here.' Kurt has appeared on national television in Australia. 'Everyone's obsessed with me,' he told chat show Studio 10 earlier this month. Superstar: Kurt Coleman also claimed he was the inspiration behind the Beyonce Knowles hit Flawless . 'I'm obsessed with me and that just makes everyone else obsessed with me.' Kurt's online discussions don't just focus on himself. He engages in social commentary and political debate regularly and recently offered up a novel theory behind the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. 'The Malaysian plane flew really high in the air and out of the planet, that's why no one can find it, it went in to space,' he suggested. Body paint: Kurt Coleman is a big fan of spray tans . In a Bob Dylanesque YouTube video, the teenager claimed he was threatened with suspension from his high school for signing autographs. He said his ambition is to host his own television show and recently signed up to a regular paid segment on Studio 10.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . A personal trainer to the stars says you don't need to match the salaries of celebrities in order to emulate their athletic physiques. Instead, Jon Denoris - whose clients include singers Rachel Stevens and Natasha Bedingfield and The Hills star Whitney Port - said all you need to stay in shape is some basic equipment like dumbbells... and his new book. And if you can't afford the dumbbells he recommends working with what you have instead, whether that's a water bottle, brief case or handbag. Solutions for all: Jon says anyone can get fit without expensive equipment - even a water bottle could be used as a weight. The svelte Rachel Stevens, right, is one of his celebrity clients . London based Jon, 39, has written 'The . Pop-Up Gym', published by Bloomsbury next week, in which he reveals the . fitness secrets he shares with the stars. He explained to MailOnline that it's not about spending money but changing lifestyle habits and getting active - no matter where you are. As such, his workouts can be done at home, in the local park or even at work or while on holiday. He said: 'Working with people in the entertainment . and business worlds, I have had to find fitness solutions for them that . are creative and spontaneous, for example at the recording studio, on . set or in hotel rooms on the road. The book is a natural progression of . this type of work.' The park is your oyster: A local bench can be used for step ups, or you can do the moves on your stairs at home . No dumbbells? Use your bag to tone up your arms by weightlifting without going to the gym . No need for fancy equipment: Jon demonstrates to a client how a tree can be used for pull ups . He added: 'I hope that it breaks down some of . the barriers to fitness and demonstrates just how easy it can be to . enjoy fitness and have fun. It's aimed at anyone who wants to become . more active, particularly those who are time pressured and who don't . always have fancy equipment close by.' Jon has devised a number of routines aimed at raising the heart rate and strength and conditioning. Moves include lunges, squats and press ups and high intensity interval work. While this type of workout is nothing new, Jon said it is often overlooked as people look for complicated challenges over simplicity - when the latter can provide just as good, or better, results. Mobile workouts: Jon said the aim of the book is to help people keep fit wherever they are . He said: 'Most experts try to make fitness sound . complicated, I wanted to create something that was so simple that it . would be usable. I've always felt that simplicity is an art form, fitness unplugged if . you like.' As a result, Jon is all for using what you have around you to help you achieve your fitness goals, rather than splashing out on expensive gym membership and equipment. For example, if you can't afford to buy dumbbells or an Olympic bar, he suggests lifting a heavy bag or brief case instead or do pull ups using a tree branch. Your local park bench is a useful tool for step ups and press ups while the stairs at home can also be used to keep fit. He said: 'Everyone is an individual. I want people to work . as hard as they can safely, while having fun. I want them to create . habits that encourage consistency - this is where so many people fall . short in their fitness routines, you have to be in it for life.' This is why Jon says it's important for people to find out which location works for them. For some of his celebrity clients, like blogger Perez Hilton, this means exercising in his hotel room when travelling for work. Perez said: 'Despite my poor diet while I was in town . and drinking like a Londoner, I still managed to lose weight and improve . my fitness during my recent trip. And I have Jon to thank for that.' Busy London Mayor Boris Johnson is another of Jon's clients and he advised him to do daily stretches and moves that were possible to do in his office incorporating his furniture like his desk and chair. Even though Jon owns a fitness studio of his own, Club 51, in London, he believes exercising in a non-gym environment is the future. He said: 'Gyms need to spend more time working on behavioral change and helping people plan lifestyle fitness solutions, they are too easily led down the fad route and often don't offer value, this is why the budget gyms are booming. 'Thanks to advances in wearable technology and remote-based coaching, people can now get levels of support and help that the traditional gym will be unable to match.' Along with the exercise routines, Jon explains how to get your mind in gear for a long-­term commitment to fitness. He also shares motivational tips, fat‐burning advice and nutritional information.

"By . Misty White Sidell . Vogue creative director Grace Coddington was temporarily banned from Instagram over the weekend for her first post on the platform - a self-portrait sketch of her bathing topless. Ms Coddington, 73, known by fashion fans for her starring role in the 2009 documentary The September Issue, joined Instagram on Friday and quickly accumulated a few thousand followers. But by the weekend, her account had gone dark – purportedly due to the sketch, which was created to promote online auctioneer Paddle 8’s ‘No Clothes’ charity auction. Locked down: Vogue magazine's creative director Grace Coddington (pictured) had her Instagram account briefly frozen after she posted a topless sketch of herself on Friday . Instagram, of course, has a strict no-nudity policy that has led to similar bans placed on accounts from Rihanna and model Anja Rubik. Today however, Ms Coddington’s account was restored. Instagram claims that its blocking of Ms Coddington’s account was an accident, and that the app’s personnel made a mistake while processing a complaint against the photo. A representative for Instagram told The Cut: ‘When our team processes reports from other members of the Instagram community, we occasionally make a mistake. ‘In this case, we wrongly removed content and worked to rectify the error as soon as we were notified. We apologize for any inconvenience.’ In the brief time that her Instagram was dark shut down, at least one member of fashion’s elite shared an Instagram post to show their support for her. Offending content: This sketch, drawn by Ms Coddington to promote a Paddle 8 charity auction, is what caused her account to be frozen . W magazine fashion director Edward Enninful posted a photo of the cover for Ms Coddington’s first book, Grace, writing: ‘Grace Coddington's Instagram is no longer active because of her 1st post, the nude self portrait!!!!!! Grace will be back soon with a new account xoxo Stay posted! #gracecoddington #legend’ Now with her account back in working order, Ms Coddington has posted a new sketch to address her profile’s shut down. Hitting back: After her account was restored, Ms Coddington uploaded this sketch in which her famous cats are facetiously blacked out . Earlier today she posted one of her famous cat sketches with a black bar facetiously drawn over one of the feline’s lower halves. Its cheeky caption read: ‘Good grief Pumpkin, Mother drew a nude selfie for her very first Instagram. No wonder they shut her down......she is much fatter than that.’","Instagram has a strict no-nudity policy .

"By . Bianca London . Victoria Beckham has just celebrated her landmark 40th birthday and looks better than ever. So how does one half of the world's most powerful A-list couples, mother to four young children and head of a burgeoning fashion empire stay healthy? The former Spice Girl has finally shared her secret - and it's bound to cause a buzz. What's her secret? Victoria Beckham has just hit her 40th birthday and has revealed her favourite new health superfood as bee pollen . A prolific tweeter, the former popstar tweeted her love of her favourite healthy food supplement: bee pollen. While the majority of us were devouring our leftover Easter eggs on Bank Holiday Monday, Victoria tweeted to her 7.46m followers: 'Totally obsessed with this Bee pollen! so good for u!! X vb'. Bee pollen, which is made by honeybees and priced at around £3.50 for 50g, is usually taken in granule form and you can sprinkle it onto salads or smoothies. It is widely considered one of nature's most complete nourishing superfoods because it contains nearly all of the nutrients required to function by humans, including amino acids, B-complex, and folic acid. New obsession: Victoria, who last weekend celebrated her 40th birthday, tweeted about her love for bee pollen, which she described as being 'so good for you' It is said that bee pollen boosts energy levels, can be used topically to soothe skin conditions, curbs cravings and even acts as an aphrodisiac. What does it do? Bee pollen, which can be sprinkled onto salad or into smoothies, is said to boost energy levels, curb cravings and act as an aphrodisiac . Katy Mason, Nutritionist at NutriCentre.com, said: 'Bee pollen is the pollen collected by bees from flowers; if you look closely at bees in the summer you may see little yellow balls collected on their legs, this is bee pollen which the bee is gathering to take back to the hive. 'These little pellets of bee pollen can then be harvested by bee keepers from the hive and taken to supplement the diet. 'Bee pollen is known for its rich and varied nutritional properties, it is high in proteins, amino acids, vitamins and folic acid. 'It is unique in that it is high in nutrients other products of animal origin don't possess. For example, bee pollen contains more amino acids gram for gram than beef, eggs or cheese. 'It can help increase energy due to the high B vitamin content and includes large amounts of rutin, an antioxidant that helps strengthen capillaries and blood vessels, which can support the cardiovascular system. 'Bee . pollen contains all the nutrients we need; it is a wonderful vegetarian . source of protein and contains all of the B vitamins, including vitamin . B12 which can be hard to find in vegetarian sources.' Susan . Curtis, Natural Health Director of Neal’s Yard Remedies, adds: 'Bee . pollen is one of nature's most completely nourishing foods, with nearly . all the nutrients required by humans. 'It has been used for energy and endurance since ancient . times, with a single pellet containing over 2 million nutrient-packed . flower pollen granule.' Looking good: Clearly the bee pollen is working wonders; Victoria arrived back from LA after her birthday celebrations looking younger than ever . 1. Energy booster: Full of carbohydrates, protein (50 per cent) and B vitamins, it enhances stamina and fights off fatigue . 2. Soothing: It can be used topically to treat psoriasis or . eczema . 3. Immune system booster: According to holistic health expert . Dr. Joseph Mercola, bee pollen has antibiotic-type properties, which apparently protect the body from contracting viruses . 4. Addiction treatment: Has been used holistically for years to help heal addictions and curb cravings by suppressing impulses . 5. Infertility problems: Bee pollen may help women get pregnant because it stimulates and restores ovarian . function, is a hormonal booster and an aphrodisiac . How much should you take? Katy Mason explains: 'Bee pollen can be made up of up to 40 per cent protein so one teaspoon of bee pollen (5g) would contain about 2g of . protein. 'An average protein requirement would be around 60g a day so . although bee pollen will only contribute slightly to that amount, it is . the quality of the protein in bee pollen that is so beneficial. 'What . that means is that it contains many of the different types of amino . acids that make up protein; this is great because the body needs . different amino acids as building blocks in the body. 'Bee pollen can . be taken off the spoon, added to smoothies or sprinkled on food and can . be a great way to increase the nutrients in your diet.'","Victoria, 40, tweeted about the superfood .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Mother's Day this year was a success for some, a letdown for others, and for many women across the U.S., such a disaster that it sent them into the arena of affairs. AshleyMadison.com, the world's biggest cheating website, has revealed that 17,000 moms signed up to their site on Monday in hopes of hunting down extramarital liaisons. That is over four times the number of a usual run-of-the-mill Monday, reports AshleyMadison - which boasts 26 million members worldwide and whose slogan is: 'Life is short. Have an affair.' Letdown? AshleyMadison.com is the world's largest cheating website and claims 17,000 moms signed up to look for affairs straight after Mother's Day . 'While Mother's Day might not have the implicit romance factor of Valentine's Day or an anniversary, it’s a holiday that compels women to reflect on their relationships,' founder Noel Biderman said in a press release. 'When expectations aren’t met, it can often be the last straw to trigger an affair.' The site is free for women, with men required to fork out $49 for '20 connections' and on a typical day, 65 per cent of its members are men seeking a bit on the side. This figure flips the day after Mother's Day, with 65 per cent of new sign ups being women. The only other momentous occasion which drives such a brigade of disgruntled and ill-intentioned women to the site is Valentine's Day. Cheating through the ages: Elizabeth Taylor (left) was caught in her high-profile affair with Richard Burton in 1962 and Madonna (right) is widely rumored to have cheated on then-husband Guy Richie with Alex Rodriguez . Not just the men: Leann Rimes (left) admits to cheating on her then-husband Dean Sheremet in 2009 with Eddie Cibrian, and Kristen Stewart (right) had a scandalous affair with married director Rupert Sanderson in 2012 . AshleyMadison sees in an average increase of 60 per cent in traffic on February 15 every year. MailOnline spoke to New York relationship specialist Rachel Sussman, who isn't surprised by the statistics, but finds them concerning. 'Whenever we have high expectations, we are bound to be let down,' she says, adding that being disappointed can indeed trigger women to fantasize about being with someone else. 'Once upon a time, before AshleyMadison, we'd just fantasize or wonder. But today, anyone can go online, create a profile and turn a fantasy into a reality,' she reasoned. 'It's really, really dangerous.' Sociologists have long been grappling with estimates for how common extra-marital affairs truly are, with results from various surveys indicating anywhere from 25 per cent to 75 per cent of married people admitting to being unfaithful. 'Mother's Day is a holiday . that compels women to reflect on their relationships' Admitting it being the key of course. Mr Biderman has said he 'guarantees' the figure is over 50 per cent, and at the helm of the second-biggest dating website in the world after Match.com, he is probably well placed to know. The site, named after two of America's most popular girls names, for 'discretion' purposes, regularly releases statistics it has collected, including the fact that 64 per cent of women log on to the site on their phones while their husbands are in the same room. Three to five years into a marriage is the most common time for a man or a woman to have an affair, and 22 per cent of American women admit to having no sex with their husbands at all. As for a quick geography lesson, Los Angeles sees the most adulterers users, followed by Washington DC, with Kentucky seeing the least number of philanderers. But next time a mediocre Mother's Day rolls around, Ms Sussman suggests being grateful that . you are lucky enough to be part of a family, rather than focusing on . feeling disappointed on a single day. 'Cheating is a poor band-aid and . rarely leads to anything worthwhile,' she says.","Cheating site AshleyMadison.com is the second biggest dating website in the world, after Match.com .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Never mind who is the fairest of the them all, this year's Miss England wannabes want to prove who is the fittest of them all. The beauty queens swapped their heels for trainers at the Kelham Hall and Country Park, near Newark, Nottinghamshire, today to take part in a challenging boot camp. The workout, led by specialist military trainers, had a competitive element as a place in the Miss England final was up for grabs. The race is on: Miss England competitors take part in a military style boot camp workout . Who is the fittest of them all? A place in the Miss England final was up for grabs . Keep on running: The beauty queens had to do shuttle runs and the bleep test . Attention! Military trainers put the women through their paces . A total of 79 girls put through their paces ahead of the Miss England final - which will be held in Torquay next month. Their strenuous workout included a bleep test, push-ups and shuttle runs - in temperatures reaching 23 degrees. After the hour-long session, Laura Clare, 17, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was named as Miss Sportswoman. The way to a flat stomach: The competitors do sit ups in the sun . Work it: Press ups were also enforced . Stretch: The beauty queens took part in the boot camp at Kelham Hall, Nottinghamshire . Keeping up appearances: A couple of the competitors took part with their hair in rollers . Fashion error: The hair rollers and sandals weren't too practical for the more active parts of the workout . Like she just stepped out of a salon: This beauty queen's attire wasn't in keeping with most of her fellow contestants who had opted for shorts, vests and trainers . It means blonde Laura, who won Miss South Yorkshire in February, will be fast-tracked to the final on June 14 with the chance of reaching the Miss World championships. The college student, who is studying business management, said it was the prize of reaching the final that kept her going. She said: 'It was totally overwhelming, I didn't think I'd even get through the first bleep test. I really wanted to get through to the finals so I think that's what kept me going. 'I thought I was goner in the first few minutes, I was absolutely knackered. But somehow I pushed through, don't ask me how as I just don't know. When we hit the bleep test I really didn't think I could manage more. Change of scene: They are more used to strutting their stuff on the catwalk than the playing field . Testing: The girls followed military training techniques . Ready to go: The girls wait to hear what exercises are in store . Achievement: Their trainer said they did well to complete the workout on such a hot day . Feet up: Keeping fit is all part of being a modern day beauty queen . Eye on the prize: The girls knew a place in the Miss England final was at stake . Survival of the fittest: The Miss England hopefuls have all won regional titles and want to become the national star . 'Then we had to do sit ups and burpees and all sorts, it was intense. Now I just feel excited that I'm through to the final.' Other contestants seemed to take it less seriously than Laura, taking part in hair rollers and sandals. James Evans, co-founder of Xtreme Boot Camps, who led the workout said he didn't go easy on the girls who all proved they are more than just a pretty face. He said: 'The fitness tests are like no other the contestants have previously experienced, they'll certainly be in excellent shape for the rest of the judging process. We tested the contestants not just physically but for mental toughness too. Tested: The fitness trainers said they didn't go easy on the beauty queens . And the winner is... Laura Clare, 17, was crowned Miss Sportswoman following the boot camp . Worth it: The Miss South Yorkshire said she was delighted to be fast-tracked to the Miss England final following the fitness tests . 'Xtreme Boot Camps instructors are all serving or ex-military personnel, fitness qualified to at least Level 3, using tried and tested military training techniques. 'The winner of the semi-final is fast-tracked through to the final so it's a huge responsibility to find a deserving winner. Laura really pushed herself and thoroughly deserves her title. 'The heat today has made the boot camp even tougher than usual and all the girls deserve huge respect for their achievement. 'Angie Beasley, director of Miss England, added: 'We were very impressed with the Xtreme Boot Camps training ethos and how the team intends to put hopefuls through a boot camp fitness experience that they will benefit hugely from.'","Swapped their heels for trainers at the Kelham Hall and Country Park .

"By . Katy Winter . From extravagant ceremonies to simple rustic affairs, brides-to-be have very different ideas of what constitutes the 'perfect' day. But what is constant in weddings across the world is a sense of romance - and, usually, an absence of football. This was not the case for Kelly Cutting, 25. This 'lucky' lady was surprised on the big day by her football-mad husband, who decided to keep guests amused by showing off his ball skills. Daniel Cutting, 26, entertained guests at his wedding ceremony with his 'keepy uppy' ability as he made his way down the aisle and while waiting for his bride to arrive. A video of Daniel’s impressive display of ball skills at the Isle of White wedding has now gone viral, with 250,000 views so far. The moment that Daniel made an unique entrance at his wedding doing keepy-uppy all the way down the aisle . Daniel only decided two weeks before the wedding he was going to thrill guests with the impressive display . Daniel admits that some guests reported that Kelly's family didn't look too impressed at his stunt . [caption . While work is last thing on the mind of most grooms on their wedding day, professional football freestyler Daniel decided two weeks before the wedding he was going . to 'thrill' his bride with the impressive display. The former University of Bedfordshire student, said: 'At first this . was just something I did as a hobby and something I loved to do growing . up playing football. 'When I . was about 16, I started to practise every day by balancing balls on my . head and doing keepy uppies until it got to the point where I could . easily do thousands of them. 'I . didn’t think I could make a living out of it so I went to university . and studied to be a PE teacher when I got recognised by agents. 'Since . then I’ve won a UK competition and broken a few Guinness World Records. I’ve been doing this for five years now as a job and I love it. 'They’ve . seen it thousands of times, as has Kelly. I told her I was going to . show some tricks at the wedding but it isn’t new to her. The professional football freestyler is . one of the best in the world and has smashed countless Guinness World . Records for football tricks . The video of Daniel's performance at the wedding went viral after it was posted on Youtube, gaining over 250,000 views . The professional football freestyler is one of the best in the world and has smashed countless Guinness World Records for football tricks . His records include the fastest 100m sprint while balancing a football on his forehead, which he did in just 18.53 seconds. Daniel, who is jetting off to Brazil, to work at the Rio World Cup, also holds the record for the most consecutive face rolls - rolling a football from temple to temple - where he beat the previous record three times over, with 1,810 rolls. Daniel, of Milton Keynes, says his friends are jealous of his amazing job, which sees him travelling the globe for parties and events where he meets some of the world’s best football players. He said: 'I travel all over the world doing different displays and corporate event and also provide entertainment at weddings and parties so I do a bit of everything. 'I get to work with so many famous stars because I work as a body double so I’ve met Arsenal player Olivier Giroud and Kaka, who now plays for Milan and a few other footballers, which is amazing. Daniel says that although he has performed in front of crowds of  50,000 people before but that was the most scared I¿ve ever been. 'My mates are pretty jealous of what I do because I do something I love as a job and get to travel all over the world. 'I’ve already been to Barcelona twice this year and am going to Brazil for the World Cup for two weeks. 'The first week I’ll be working with a charity going to prisons and showing my performances. It’s really rewarding because it demonstrates to them my skills and has an effect on their lives. 'It makes them realise they can turn their lives around. The second week I have some filming for YouTube to do in Rio but it’ll be more like a holiday because I’m going with my dad and brother. 'I kept the whole thing pretty quiet and didn’t even think about doing it until about two weeks before when I overheard my mum saying ""I bet he does some skills"" and thought it would be fun. 'I wanted to make the most of the opportunity and do something very different that is a part of me and my job to entertain our guests. While not a wedding for everyone, Daniel's skills certainly created some visually dramatic wedding snaps . 'I was really nervous beforehand - probably the most nervous I’ve ever been - because it was my wedding day and I had so much other stuff to worry about, like being stood up at the altar. 'I’ve performed to crowds of about 50,000 people before but that was the most scared I’ve ever been. 'I’ve actually received mixed reviews from people who said the bride’s family didn’t look too impressed but that’s my family.'","Daniel only decided to make the unusual entrance two weeks before .

"By . Misty White Sidell . One Kanye West fan has been left broken-hearted after the singer called him out for buying a fake pair of his Air Yeezy sneaker designs on Monday in Paris. The fan had approached Mr West to sign the shoes outside of a café where he had been lunching with Kim Kardashian. Never one to exercise subtlety, Mr West said of the sneakers: ‘These are not real though, you know that, right?’ The fan, who had likely paid hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, for the rare sneakers couldn’t believe it, saying: ‘Are you serious?’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Honest man: A video of Kanye West telling a fan that he purchased a pair of fake Air Yeezy sneakers has gone viral (pictured, a still from the video) Sharp eye: Mr West, who was out to lunch in Paris at the time (pictured) had been asked by the fan to sign the sneakers and Mr West obliged despite the fact they were counterfeit . Mr West, 36, graciously responded, ‘These are not real, it’s fine though,’ and signed them regardless. ‘Damn, broke my heart,’ the duped fan said as Mr West loaded into a car with the help of a security entourage, where fiancé Ms Kardashian was waiting. While the fan’s identity remains unknown, a video of their interaction was posted to Instagram by a female French Kimye fan named Dodo, whose account appears to be something of a dedicated fan page to the couple. Mr West began designing Air Yeezys in . collaboration with Nike in 2007. He spent two years working on . development with the brand before officially releasing the style in . 2009. Rare commodity: Kanye West released the first round of Air Yeezy sneakers in 2009, with a second round called the Air Yeezy II (pictured) launching in 2012 . Red riot: In February 2014 this Red October pair of Air Yeezy II's were released as a surprise for fans, igniting hysteria in the sneaker community . But before they came out, Mr West created buzz for the style by debuting them on stage at the 2008 Grammy Awards during his performance of Stronger and Hey Mama. The $215 sneakers, named for Mr West’s ‘Yeezy’ nickname, sold out almost immediately, and those who missed out on the shoes in stores have been known to shell out up to $10,000 for a pair on reselling sites like eBay - creating an opportune environment for counterfeiters. Sneakerheads who missed out on the shoes in stores have been known to shell out up to $10,000 for a pair on reselling sites like eBay - creating an opportune environment for counterfeiters. The popular style is formatted as a high-top basketball sneaker, comprised of contrasting grains and textures of leather. They have a wide strap across the top of the foot, and are known for utilizing contrast colorways like white, cream and red or black, cream and lime green. Street style: Ahead of their imminent wedding, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian have arrived in Paris for a round of serious shopping with the Kardashian clan . Mr West’s Nike partnership spawned a follow-up edition called the Air Yeezy II, which was released in 2012. The style is less athletic looking and chunkier than the first Yeezy edition. A surprise Air Yeezy II colorway called The Red Octobers was released this past February to mass fan hysteria. Prior to the Air Yeezy, Mr West had designed sneakers in collaboration with Louis Vuitton and Pharrell Williams’s line BAPE.","The shocked fan had no idea the sneakers he had bought were knock-offs, telling Mr West he was ‘heartbroken’ at the news ."

"By . Sadie Nicholas . As she lay in bed after having dinner and sharing a bottle  of wine at a restaurant with her husband, Laura-Jane Barnell suddenly felt her chest tighten and her heart begin racing wildly. For the next ten, frightening minutes, she lay in pain, waiting for the palpitations to calm down. But when they didn’t, she staggered across to open the window to get some air, all the while hearing her pulse thumping loudly in her ears. ‘I was terrified that I was about to have a heart attack,’ says Laura-Jane, 38. Terrifying effects: Before she realised she was intolerant to wine Laura-Jane Barnell thought her symptoms were a heart attack . ‘I went to see my GP because this was becoming a regular occurrence most Saturday nights. ‘I didn’t have a clue what was causing it but I was scared it was serious. I even stopped exercising, fearful that I might have an undetected heart problem.’ But she didn’t. In fact the pain and palpitations had a different explanation: Laura-Jane was experiencing an adverse reaction to the wine she so enjoyed. Her GP explained that while thousands of British women are thought to be affected, few realise the cause of their distress is their favourite tipple because the problem is not widely written or talked about. Yet it’s so common, doctors have even given it a nickname: ‘holiday heart syndrome’. Why? Because people who rarely drink at home will reach for a glass on holiday and suddenly suffer an unexpected reaction. In severe cases, it can even cause heart failure. A lack of research means we do not know why wine can have the effect and there’s no cure, except to give it up. Relieved: Laura-Jane hasn't had a drop of wine since her diagnosis . The problem is quite distinct from the well-known issues surrounding excessive consumption of alcohol, such as liver damage, reduced fertility, high blood pressure and increased risk of various cancers and heart attack. For, in this case, rather than many years of heavy drinking leading to problems, even relatively small amounts can lead to immediate — and terrifying — consequences. Many complain they suffer from palpitations after less than a single glass of wine. Laura-Jane, an administration manager for a retailer, hasn’t touched a drop since she was diagnosed with holiday heart syndrome five years ago and hasn’t had another incident since. ‘I had my first attack about a decade ago after dining at a friend’s house,’ says Laura-Jane, who lives in Hartwell, Northamptonshire, with her husband Jon, 40, and their children Lexie, five, and Lennon, three. ‘I assumed I’d just drunk too much white wine. ‘But over the next few years it reached a point where it didn’t matter whether I had several glasses on a Saturday night out or a couple of mouthfuls at the end of a stressful day — the physical reaction was always the same. ‘I was surprised but relieved when my doctor said it was a common reaction to wine since the irony is that, like millions of women, I often used to have a glass to unwind or to relax before bed. I haven’t touched a drop of wine since as I never want to feel so poorly again.’ Consultant cardiologist Zaheer Yousef says the condition is becoming increasingly prevalent among those over 30 because nowadays we drink wine to relieve stress, as well as when we’re out socially. ‘Alcohol can trigger heart palpitations, arrhythmias — where the heart beats too slowly or too quickly,’ explains Dr Yousef. ‘If sustained for long periods of time, a racing heart can cause heart failure. Meanwhile the arrythmias can lead to the development of blood clots which can cause a stroke.’Dr Yousef, from the University Hospital of Wales, says it’s not known why alcohol — particularly wine — is to blame, but it’s quite common to suddenly develop an intolerance. ‘As we get older,’ says Dr Yousef, ‘our body becomes more intolerant of alcohol, our heart changes, and our blood pressure and hormones alter. This is a complicated cocktail that can increase a person’s susceptibility to palpitations and arrhythmias. ‘You could experience this reaction to alcohol for a couple of years and then it might pass. Again, it’s not known exactly why.’ Holiday heart syndrome: Many people who do not usually drink at home suffer an unexpected reaction when they have wine on holiday . Heart palpitations aren’t the only problem that wine can cause. Even the smallest amounts have been linked to causing extreme nausea and exacerbation of chronic skin disorders such as eczema and rosacea — a reddening of the facial skin. If Sarah Rowlands, 29, has so much as a sip of wine, the rosacea that’s plagued her from the age of 14 goes into overdrive. ‘Within five minutes, I can feel my face burning up,’ explains Sarah, a business development manager for a technical company. The first time Sarah, from London, noticed the problem was during her final year studying languages at Oxford University. ‘My friends and I drank a lot of wine to calm our nerves as we revised for our final exams,’ she says. ‘My skin was particularly problematic at the time and there was barely a day when the redness and sore lumps weren’t raging but I didn’t connect the two things at the time. ‘Then, when I started work, I quickly got into the habit of having a glass of wine to unwind at the end of the day, only for my skin to flare up dramatically. I’d also feel nauseous after a couple of mouthfuls.’ Lack of research: Despite the problem being a common one no one knows why wine has this effect on so many women and there is no cure . It was only when she sought help from specialists a few years ago that wine was diagnosed to be the cause of her problems. ‘I’ve seen many skin experts and the one thing they all agree on is that wine exacerbates rosacea considerably, possibly as a result of the amount of refined sugar it contains,’ she says. Sarah now sticks to vodka and soda as it doesn’t irritate her skin. Consultant dermatologist Dr Bav Shergill says: ‘You’d think spirits and other alcohol would have the same effect but there seems to be something about wine, and red wine in particular, that many rosacea sufferers report as causing a big flare-up. ‘This could be down to some of the additives in the wine or the fermentation process, such as the tannins, sulphites or colourants used. ‘We don’t currently understand why, but we do know that alcohol dilates the capillaries in the face and therefore the circulation. ‘This could be responsible for exacerbating flare-ups in rosacea sufferers as well as those with psoriasis and eczema who find their skin condition becomes almost instantly inflamed and itchy. Again, we don’t know exactly why, but it could be linked to alcohol dehydrating the body and skin.’ Maybe this is why wine sales have dropped three per cent in the past year while those of spirits and liqueurs have soared by up to 20 per cent. Or it could be because wine can stop you from sleeping too. Natasha Collins-Daniel, 30, gave up her favourite tipple, white wine, after suffering from severe insomnia — as well as a racing heart — every time she indulged. The first time it happened was in her early 20s, when she found she couldn’t sleep after drinking even one glass. After many similar experiences over the years, Natasha, a manager for the Soil Association, realised wine was causing the problem. ‘It was the only rational explanation as the sleeplessness and racing heart only ever happened when . I drank white wine,’ explains Natasha, who lives in Bristol with husband James and their five-month-old baby, Nina. ‘I now stick to gin and tonic but at a friend’s wedding recently, I forgot myself and had a glass of wine.’ Scared: Laura-Jane initially thought she had an undetected heart problem . That night,  she couldn’t sleep and found herself standing outside in the early hours with raging insomnia. Dr Yousef explains that although many women drink wine in the evening to help them unwind in the belief it will encourage restful sleep, wine — and alcohol in general — is a well-known cause of sleeplessness. ‘The human body produces an essential amino acid called glutamine which is a natural stimulant, almost like your own in-built caffeine, but alcohol suppresses its production,’ he explains. ‘So when you first go to bed after a few drinks, the alcohol may have a sedative effect, but then there is what’s called “rebound awakening”, where the amount of glutamine being produced suddenly increases, stimulating you to such a degree that you simply cannot sleep.’ Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and medical adviser to Drinkaware, says that perhaps we need to call time on the culture of ‘wine o’clock’. ‘The great irony is that wine has become the drink of choice for women in the belief that a few glasses will help them to relax, and feel more sociable,’ says Dr Jarvis. ‘But actually it’s leading to a rise in those women suffering health problems such as palpitations, insomnia and exacerbation of skin conditions, although many of them have yet to make the link between the two.’","Thousands of British women are thought to be affected .

"By . Katy Winter . Having problems working up enthusiasm for a gym session? These photos could provide you with a bit of inspiration. The images of nude, very buff men doing CrossFit (a tough mixture of weight-lifting, rope-climbing and tyre-flipping), were originally used by . Danish gym Spartan Mentality as an April Fool's Day ad. However, the gym soon found itself inundated with people turning up hoping . to actually work out in the buff: naked CrossFit might sound uncomfortable but it appears there's a real market for it. Spartan Mentality gives the gym-shy some real motivation to work out . Originally a spoof advert, the Danish gym soon found people actually turning up to work out nude . So overwhelming was the response that the owners of the Aarhus gym, Steffen Haldrup Andersen and Rune Jensen, decided to turn their prank into reality and offer real naked cross-fit classes each Sunday. Speaking at the launch, Andersen said: ‘People are already so scantily-clad at Cross-Fit that . we thought we might as well throw the rest away.’ And, as these photos reveal, CrossFit really is a good choice for those who want to tone up, with plenty of chiselled abs and bulging biceps on show. Unfortunately for those who fancy trying their hand at the unusual exercise regime, a combination of intense media attention and several outraged reactions saw the class closed soon after it started. Speaking to The Copenhagen Post, co-owner Rune Jensen explained: ‘It started out as an April Fool’s joke that got too much attention. ‘We then actually decided to start up the nude sessions, but in the end there was too much media focus on us. It all got a little too comical and we changed our minds. I have no idea how the story went viral.’ Cross-fit really is a good choice for those who want to tone up, with plenty of chiselled abs and bulging biceps on show . If your idea of the perfect partner is someone who manages to be both muscular and fond of getting naked, these photos could be prove the motivation you need to get to the gym . It could be described as 'the Fight Club' of workouts: a punishing regime of Olympic weight-lifting, rope-climbing and tyre-flipping, and spectacular displays of gymnastic strength and balance. Devised 20 years ago by American gym coach Greg Glassman in California, cross-fit immediately proved popular with military, police and fire academy trainees. Later, it was adopted by Hollywood personal trainers looking for a quick way to help A-list actors get into shape among them, Brad Pitt, Magic Mike star Channing Tatum and Jason Statham. 'It now has a massive following and is extremely popular,' explains Virgin Active group exercise manager Gillian Reeves. 'It's part of a trend for group activity involving hard-core exercise - boot camps started it and there are now mass endurance events like Tough Mudder.' A typical class includes a warm-up, a skill session, where you learn about a certain element such as lifting or a movement, and ends with the 'Workout of the Day', which combines and repeats all movements. However, Gillian warns that it is not suitable for all. 'Some moves are very difficult, so it's great for people wanting to push themselves but doesn't suit everyone - and too much too soon can cause injury.'","The classes began as an April Fool's gag on the part of an Aarhus gym .

Not allowed: Mr Doran is among those banned from travelling to Rio for the World Cup which starts tomorrow . Fears: Known hooligans such as Mr Doran have been banned from travelling for fear of scenes like this . Not so scary: According to Ms Hardman, people get into more trouble down at their local pub . She would, however, be happy for Doran to put up a few England flags if he wants to. 'He can if he wants,' she says. 'He put up a big Rochdale flag for the documentary.' Despite the impending football fest in Rio, the Channel 5 documentary, Football Hooligan and Proud, is what is really causing her a few sleepless nights. 'I am a bit worried about how they will portray him in the documentary,' she confesses. What if he comes across as a thug? 'He is a thug,' she ripostes, adding: 'But it's not just him - there's thousands of them.' And she isn't wrong. Doran is behind a 50,000 strong Facebook group where hooligans - would-be and current - can go to exchange gossip and organise meetings. 'They just all go on the site for the banter and talk a load of crap,' says Amanda. 'I don't go on it - it's boring.' While she might find it boring, she says football hooligans certainly aren't as black as they're painted by the media and the authorities. 'They're just a bunch of lads going to the football who go and have a row with opposing fans. If that's the case, then everyone's a hooligan. 'If they do something down the pub, they just get sent home to sober up but if they do something in the stadium, they get arrested. 'Really, if they [Doran and his friends] are hooligans, then everyone's a hooligan.' That doesn't mean she has any sympathy for Doran and his four year ban, however. 'If he's going to the match and they're going to cause bother, then he knows what's going to happen to him,' she raps. 'It's his own fault!' Lee Doran appears on Football Hooligan and Proud, tonight at 9pm on Channel 5 .","Amanda Hardman, 43, from Rochdale, is the girlfriend of Lee Doran, 37 .

"By . Margot Peppers . President Barack Obama has two important jobs - leading the country, and being father to two teenage girls. Now he has opened up about the latter and what it takes to raise kids in the White House. In an interview with former first daughter Jenna Bush Hager on the Today show, the President tells her that 15-year-old Malia and 13-year-old Sasha think of him as 'a good, fun dad who teeters on the edge of being embarrassing sometimes. 'As Malia put it, I'm right on the edge,' he said. 'But I usually stay on the right side of the edge of being funny rather than totally humiliating to them.' Scroll down for video . His most important job: President Barack Obama opened up to Jenna Bush Hager about raising two teen girls in the White House in a new episode of the Today show . Despite sometimes embarrassing his girls like any other dad, Obama says they maintain a close relationship and make an effort to be open with each other about their feelings. 'The one thing the girls know about me is I love 'em to death,' he said. 'Younger parents… ask me why it is that Malia and Sasha turned out so well. I say, ""Well, first of all, you know - marry somebody who's going to be a great mom,"" which I did. But second of all, unconditional love sure makes a difference.' As the daughter of former President George W Bush, Jenna - who gave birth to her her first child, a daughter named Mila, in April 2013 - has a unique firsthand perspective on families in the White House. And while she told Obama that she and her twin sister Barbara sometimes struggled with overhearing criticism of their father, it seems Malia and Sasha are relatively indifferent. 'Up until recently they have shown absolutely no interest in what I did,' he confessed, explaining that it helps resolve any issues when they discuss his political decisions during dinnertime. Appreciation: 'It goes by quick,' said the father of 15-year-old Malia and 13-year-old Sasha. 'Understand that there's nothing that's going to be more precious in your life, and you are going to savor every memory' Political families: As the daughter of George W Bush, Jenna - who gave birth to her her first child, a daughter named Mila, in April 2013 - has a firsthand perspective on growing up in the White House . 'I explain to them, ""Here's why I made a decision that I made,""' he said. ' And so in some ways, they're getting a sense of how I think through problems.' Balancing fatherhood with presidential duties is undoubtedly a challenge, especially with two teen girls. 'The one thing the girls know is I love 'em to death -unconditional love sure makes a difference' To get his take on it, Jenna asked Obama: 'What is harder, being a protective father of teenagers or President of the United States?' Smiling as he considered his answer, the President joked that living in the White House actually makes fatherhood easier, to an extent. 'Well, as you know, and you may have chafed under this a little bit, they do have a Secret Service detail,' he said. Savor the moments: 'When you're on your death bed, that's the stuff you're going to remember - you holding hands with your daughter,' Obama told Jenna (pictured together in an Instagram snap) 'I've joked that the main reason I ran for reelection was to sustain that all the way through their high school years.' On a more serious note, however, the father-of-two added that the most important part of parenthood is appreciating every moment of it. 'It goes by quick,' he said, advising: 'Don't just . spend time with your kids because it's good for the kids; understand . that there's nothing that's going to be more precious in your life, and you . are going to savor every memory. 'And when you're on your death . bed, that's the stuff you're going to remember - you holding hands with . your daughter and taking them to the park and pushing them on a swing and hearing them laugh… You just want to make sure you don't miss out on that.' Extra protection: President Obama (pictured with his daughters in January) joked that the main reason he ran for reelection was so that the Secret Service detail would keep an eye on the girls . White House living: Although Jenna (middle) and her twin sister Barbara were 20 when their father was sworn in, making them quite a bit older than the Obama girls, they undoubtedly shared some of the same experiences . Jenna and her sister Barbara were 20 when their father was sworn in as President, making them quite a bit older than the Obama girls. 'When you're on your death bed, that's the stuff you're going to remember - you holding hands with your daughter' Still, they undoubtedly shared some of the same experiences growing up with such a prominent father. And in an Instagram post shared yesterday, Jenna wrote that her dad and President Obama have more in common than just the White House. 'One thing I learned from my dear dad is that family is more important than politics,' she said. 'Tune into @todayshow to hear Pres Obama talk about his most important role: fatherhood.'",President Obama joked that the main reason he ran for reelection was to have the Secret Service detail keep an eye on Malia and Sasha 'all the way through their high school years'
"By . Margot Peppers . A group of mothers staged a nurse-in at their local Friendly's this weekend after one woman was asked to cover up while breastfeeding her eight-week-old daughter there. Tabitha Donohue of Norwich, Connecticut, told Fox CT that she was dining at the fast food restaurant on Friday and nursing her daughter Rune when a manager approached her to say she was making the other customers uncomfortable. 'Management came over and told me to cover it up or stop feeding her,' she explained. 'And I told them I didn't want to do either of those things.' Scroll down for video . Protest: A group of mothers staged a nurse-in at their local Friendly's this weekend after one mom, Tabitha Donue (right) was asked to cover up while breastfeeding her eight-week-old daughter there . Group effort: On Saturday afternoon, about 50 mothers accompanied by their spouses and other family members brought their babies to the restaurant, where they proceeded to breastfeed . Liz Linehan, a mother-of-three from Cheshire, Connecticut, read about the incident on Facebook and helped Ms Donahue organize a nurse-in to protest the restaurant's attitude toward breastfeeding. She was motivated to take a stand after reading some hurtful comments on Facebook. 'There were a ton of responses saying that nursing moms are just trying to get attention and that we're vulgar and that nursing is pornographic,' she said. So on Saturday afternoon, about 50 mothers accompanied by their spouses and other family members brought their babies to the restaurant, where they proceeded to breastfeed. Other supporters lined the streets carrying signs that read: 'I make milk. What's your super power?' Incident: Ms Donohue was nursing her daughter Rune on Friday when a manager approached her and said she was making the other customers uncomfortable . Know the law: The issue arose because the Friendly's employee was not aware of a state law that requires no restrictions or limitations may be placed on a mother's right to breastfeed a child . Change of attitude: 'In America, there's been an over-sexualized culture of the breasts,' said Liz Linehan, who helped organize the nurse-in. 'We have to remember, breasts are made for feeding babies' In it together: Mothers sit on a the curb nursing outside Friendly's . It seems the issue arose because the Friendly's employee was not aware of a state law that says no restrictions or limitations may be placed on a mother's right to breastfeed a child. 'Unfortunately, the manager didn't know anything about the law,' explained Ms Linehan, adding that society's perception of nursing is at fault. 'In America, there's been an over-sexualized culture of the breasts. We have to remember, breasts are made for feeding babies.'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . A woman who chose to leap 20ft from a window onto concrete to escape a crazed sex attacker has shared the story of her horrific dilemma. Jemma Rixon appeared on today's This Morning to reveal how she risked her life to jump from a building rather than be left in the clutches of schizophrenic Craig Cantwell. She told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that she had 'no option' but to leap from the window at the care home where she worked in Birkenhead in last July after Cantwell started threatening her. Horrific dilemma: Jemma Rixon chose to leap 20ft from a window to escape a sex attacker . Jemma, 20, admitted she may have been 'naive' about Cantwell, 29, in the past when he had made references to them being a couple as she carried out her duties at the home where he was a patient. Then one day when she was helping him with his medication, he locked her in a medication room with him. Jemma recalled: 'I had my back to him but I heard the sound of the door being locked and knew something wasn't right. I tried to . be normal and to stay clam and professional. He started being . aggressive and pushing me on the shoulder, demanding me to get into . bathroom and bend over.' She added: 'I managed to fight him off, we had tug of war with the bathroom door but I managed with all my strength . to lock it. 'I had my phone and was trying to call the police but I was so frightened I couldn't dial. I managed to ring the person on my last call list but they didn't answer. 'Then he started saying, ""Jemma come out or I'll hurt you"".' Nightmare: The care home worker shared her story on This Morning. Presenter Eamonn Holmes said her experience was 'like a horror film' In what Eamonn described as like 'something from a horror film', Cantwell then started smashing a hole in the plasterboard wall to try and reach Jemma. Within seconds, he had been able to create a gap large enough to push his head and shoulder through. '...it completely knocked my confidence, I now suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and have nightmares' Jemma said she knew then her only option was to jump out the window. She said: 'I realised he could get to me in seconds, my only option was to jump. The window was so small, I just flung myself out and landed on my back on concrete.' As a result of her fall, the care worker fractured her spine, neck and foot. But her ordeal still wasn't over as Cantwell then began rushing from the building to reach her. Still recovering: Jemma suffers from post traumatic stress . She said she managed to 'stagger' into the street where she appealed for help from some milkman doing their morning rounds. Cantwell then appeared on the street brandishing a metal pole which he used to start smashing parked cars. As previously reported in the Daily Mail, he was then arrested and stood trial at Liverpool Crown Court after he denied inflicting grievous bodily harm, affray and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence. Despite his mental health issues, the court heard Cantwell, from Manchester, knew what he was doing on the night of the attack. He was found guilty by a jury on all charges and jailed for nine years. Jemma said on This Morning that she was 'happy' with the sentence but she is still struggling to come to terms with her ordeal. She said: 'It completely knocked my confidence, I now suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and have nightmares.'","Care home worker Jemma Rixon, 20, was threatened by patient .

"By . Sara Malm . Although Gangnam Style has been banished into one-hit-wonder heaven for quite some time across the globe, in Alaska, it's still topping the charts - at least for this furry dancer. A large grizzly bear was spotted doing the signature moves associated with the 2012 party plague in Katmai National Park  in southern Alaska. The bear managed to copy the routine of Psy, the South Korean rapper behind the Gangnam phenomenon, as it dried off by a river. Gangnam Style: The brown bear appears to have managed to nail the choreography to Psy's global superhit . Although it looked as if the bear was keen get down Gangnam style, it  was in fact only drying itself off after fishing in a nearby river. Photographer Alexey Tishchenko, 44, says he started laughing when he first saw the sequence of pictures. ‘I had been watching the bears fish for quite a while before this one decided to stand up and make its way across the shoreline,' Mr Tishchenko said. ‘I managed to get some shots of it drying itself off but I had no idea how funny they were until I checked my camera.' Dance trance: The bear was spotted dancing Gangnam Style in Katmai National Park in Alaska . Hey, sexy lady: South Korean singer Psy released Gangnam Style in 2012, which later became first ever video to reach one billion views on YouTube . Dancing bear: Although the grizzly was drying himself off, it looked as if he was dancing to the 2012 hit song . ‘We had been photographing the bears for quite a few hours so that they would get comfortable with our presence, our patience really paid off. ‘Bears can be very entertaining creatures, just looking at these pictures makes me realise why I enjoy photographing them so much.’ Gangnam Style became a global superhit after its release in 2012, catapulting Psy into international stardom which saw him perform all around the world and even do the signature dance with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The video for Gangnam Style became the first ever video to reach one billion views on YouTube in December 2012, and now has more than two billion views.","Bear spotted dancing to Gangnam Style in Alaska national park .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Forget going under the knife, if you want to show off a bountiful cleavage on the beach this summer then Ultimo say they have the answer. The lingerie brand promise to boost women by two cup sizes with their 'boob job' bikini. Following on from the success of their 'OMG Plunge Bra' the company are responding to demand from their customers who want to be body confident on their summer holidays. Instant lift: Ultimo model Rebecca Donaldson said the bikini boosted her bust from a 32B to a 32D . But rather than resort to expensive surgery to get a lift, Ultimo offers the same effect for £30 with their bikini top, which is available in hot pink and cobalt shades. Matching briefs cost £14. They create the uplifting effect using in-built gel technology which is integrated into a foam cup. The bikinis go on sale today in sizes 32A to 3DD and eight to 18 for the briefs. Rebecca Donaldson, who modelled the bikini for the Ultimo campaign, said she was impressed with the way the swimwear boosted her cleavage from a 32B to an ample 32D. True blue: Ultimo founder Michelle Mone models a swimsuit from the summer collection . The model from Perth, Scotland, said: 'I've always been flat chested and wanted bigger boobs, . but I would never consider anything as drastic as going under the knife. When I put the bikini on for the first time, it took a bit of getting . used to - as I suddenly had boobs - but the effect was amazing. I was . definitely a full two cup sizes bigger and my cleavage was really . natural looking.' Ultimo founder Michelle Mone OBE, is also pleased with the design and has already been pictured in a similar style for previous advertising campaigns. Boob job bikini: The hot pink and cobalt blue tops cost £30 each - a lot less than a real boob job . Meanwhile the matching briefs costs £14 available from size 8 to 18 . She said: 'This is the bikini of all bikinis. For girls that lack volume in the cleavage department, this is an instantaneous, natural-looking boost for the bust and as effective as a boob job. 'The most important thing about this design is that the internal gel is light as a feather, so you barely notice the extra volume at all, but you have the benefit of being a whole two cups sizes bigger. For women who are an A or B cup, this is an absolute godsend and an Ultimo holiday must-have.' A recent survey published on MailOnline found more than half of British women hate their bodies - and would rather forgo a holiday then dare to bare in a bikini. These swimsuits are also part of the new collection and cost £40. The suit has a tummy control panel for anyone self-conscious about their stomach . Thanks to the rise of instantly sharing snaps on social media, many fear being seen not just on the beach but online in their swimwear. But Michelle believes their bikini can give a self-esteem boost as well as a cleavage one to self-conscious Brits. She said: 'Looking good on the beach or by the pool has never been so important - and this is the perfect solution to create incredible curves.' The new collection also includes a swimsuit with a tummy control panel for anyone who doesn't want to show off their stomach. Michelle says the right fit and style is important to showcase your best assets . SIZE MATTERS: Any good swimwear brand will size by cups, so think of swimwear as an extension of your lingerie drawer - make sure that it fits properly! It is vital for a woman to be expertly fitted on a regular basis, and I recommend every six months. Once you know the right size, then it's easy for you to try on different shapes and strap solutions. Don't be afraid to ask for assistance and let the experts advise on the best styles to boost your assets. EXPERIMENT: Swimwear is similar to a good pair of jeans - you have to try on a lot before you find one that's ""just right."" If you think a bikini is the only way to look sexy on the beach, think again; a great tankini or one-piece that shows less skin can be equally flattering and look just as hot. There's also lots of trickery nowadays, from gel cups to add a little boost to slimming mesh panels to streamline your silhouette. Experiment with various shapes and styles no matter how young or old you are. BE BOLD: I'm all for experimenting with colour. Bold shades look just beautiful in the sunshine and can really highlight a gorgeous golden tan. Be brave and go bright! WATCH YOUR BACK: Don't forget to look at yourself from the back, beware of saggy bottoms or briefs that disappear when you walk - that's not a good look. The backside view counts as much as the front, especially in swimwear! BE STYLE SAVVY: I think every woman should invest in a good quality one piece as a basic summer staple. It's a timeless piece, and although trends may come and go, this classic shape never goes out of style and will reappear in your suitcase year after year. SHOP ONLINE: If you just don't feel comfortable stripping off and shopping for swimwear in store, why not browse online? There’s a lot to choose from out there so be adventurous, as you might be surprised at what suits! Order what takes your fancy or the styles that you like, and try them on in the luxury of your own home. Although make sure to check return or exchange policies on everything you purchase online beforehand so that you can return whatever you don't like. ACCESSORISE: The glamour stakes on the beach have shot up in recent years so remember to accessorise and look out for lovely detailing in swimwear like brushed gold accents that add a little touch of luxury. MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT YOU'VE GOT: So, you don't have the body of a swimsuit model - don't get stressed because nobody's perfect and most people don’t. Downplay your less-loved parts and focus on what you do have, accentuate those bits and you’ll feel a million dollars no matter where you are soaking up the sun this summer. The Beach 'Boob Job' Bikini is . part of Ultimo's new swimwear collection which also includes swimsuits . and bikinis with non-gel options for women who prefer a more discreet . look, available from Visit www.ultimo.co.uk .","Creates uplifting effect using in-built gel technology and foam cup .

"By . Katy Winter . Heavyweight trucker Sean Paterson shed more than half his body weight - after doctors told him he was becoming too unhealthy to drive. Sean, 48, tipped the scales at 24st after an unhealthy truckstop diet of burgers, fish suppers and chocolate bars. But he lost over 10st after he was warned he could have sleep apnoea - a medical condition brought on by his weight - and could face losing his driving licence. Sean's truckstop diet of burgers, fish suppers and chocolate bar snacks had led to his weigh increasing to 24st . Sean dropped half his body weight by using meal replacement drinks for breakfast and lunch and eating a healthy evening meal . Now the HGV driving instructor, from Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, weighs a trim 13st 8lb and runs 7km every day. He said: 'I would lose weight and then put more on. I lived on junk food. Gregg’s pies, curries and fish suppers - that was my diet. 'It was fast food all the time. My wife ate normally but I would just eat rubbish. 'I would have a chocolate bar even before breakfast.' Sean’s driving career almost hit the skids when medics told him he might have sleep apnoea - a constriction of the airwaves caused by the fat around his throat, which would have made him illegible for an HGV licence. He said: 'I snore when I sleep and my wife noticed that I would stop breathing when I slept so we went to get it checked out. 'I went to the consultant at Stobhill Hospital and he warned me that they would have to contact the DVLA if it was confirmed I had sleep apnoea. Being told that his size was not only effecting his health but jeopardizing his career was the prompt Sean needed to lose weight . 'I couldn’t believe it. I walked out of the hospital and realised it was time to change. 'I faced losing my livelihood, my health, because of my weight around my neck it was making it difficult for me to breathe when I lay flat.' Sean’s job as an HGV driving instructor meant he trained emergency service workers and was one of six instructors sent to Arbroath to train Royal Commandos in off-road driving before they were deployed to Afghanistan. But he admitted standing alongside fit soldiers was 'a bit embarrassing' when he was at his heaviest. Sean began to lose weight using Herbalife last year, a nutritional supplement, which sees him drink two shakes for breakfast and lunch, with a main meal in the evening of chicken and veg. He also revealed it was three weeks before he could get onto a regular set of scales, because he was too big. Medics told Sean he might have sleep apnoea - a constriction of the airwaves caused by the fat around his throat . Sean said: 'After I started the diet, I was too heavy in the first three weeks, so I had to go in and check my weight on one of those big scales in Boots. 'I wanted to make myself better and add some more years to my life. Before I started my diet I couldn’t walk more than 20 yards but now I have so much energy. As well as his work as a HGV instructor, Sean now runs Fit Factor, at Signatures Studio, in North Lanarkshire. His wife Ann, 49, a senior support worker, said: 'It was quite scary - I would wake up and there would be 30 to 40 seconds when he wasn’t breathing. 'We had even considered a gastric band until he started to lose the weight. The doctor had warned him he wouldn’t see 50 if he didn’t make a change. 'I was frightened for him, but it’s completely changed his life. 'The other week we were out for dinner and an old friend didn’t recognise him because of how much weight he had lost - she thought I was with a new boyfriend. 'I’m really proud of him.'","Diet of drive thru meals and sedentary lifestyle caused weight to reach 24st .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Parents are being warned about the dangers of liquid detergent capsules following a number of cases of children biting into them after apparently mistaking them for sweets. The brightly coloured capsules, which are used in dishwashers and washing machines, cause an immediate chemical burn, resulting in breathing problems as the airway swells. The consequences could be fatal without medical attention. The warning comes after five youngsters under the age of two have been admitted to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow . this year after possibly thinking they were jelly sweets. Dishwasher and washing machine liquitabs pose a threat to children who can mistake them for sweets, doctors have warned . Butylphenyl methylpropional: . A synthetic fragrance that is also used in a number of beauty products. It is considered safe only within recommended use of concentration.However, . it is a skin irritant and there have been tests that found that skin . applications at high concentrations in animals caused sperm damage. Alpha-isomethyl Ionone: Banned . by the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) from being mixed into . fragrance products, such as perfume and cologne, it . has been found to irritate the skin and trigger allergic reactions in . some people. However, it is still found in detergents and other . cosmetics that are not classed as a 'fragrance'. Linalool, Hexyl cinnamal, Citronellol: Severe . allergens that be listed on the label because they are severe . allergens. Higher concentrations can even cause central nervous system . disruption (thus their use in certain pesticides) and skin, eye and . respiratory tract irritation. These chemicalc can also trigger asthma . attacks. Parents should take a child to their nearest A&E if it is suspected they have swallowed something poisonous, doctors said. They have also called for childproof packaging for the products to stop youngsters being able to get to them. Dr Lyndsay Fraser, from the hospital's ear, nose and throat department, said: 'We have known for some time about the risk of eye injuries from kids squeezing these liquitabs until they burst. 'What we have seen more recently is that children are biting into the tablets, presumably because they think they are sweets as they have the same soft texture and bright colouring. 'The alkaline chemicals in the liquitab cause an immediate chemical burn, causing breathing problems as the airway starts to swell rapidly. Getting them to hospital straight away is imperative. 'In most of the cases seen so far, we have had to insert a breathing tube to protect the child's airway from the swelling and help them breathe. If these children hadn't reached A&E on time, the airway could close over completely with potentially fatal consequences."" Once the breathing tube is inserted, children can be on a ventilator for as long as two weeks until the swelling settles. One child admitted to the hospital required further surgery to repair the damage caused by the capsule. Dr Fraser said: 'It really is only good fortune that we haven't seen a death resulting from this type of injury. 'It is important parents realise that . these liquid capsules are dangerous chemicals and they should be kept . locked away so children can't reach them. They must be stored safely at . all times, out of reach and sight of young children. 'Wherever possible and, as with all . household cleaning products and bleaches, they should be stored in a . locked cupboard or in a cupboard that cannot be accessed by children.' Five toddlers aged under two have been admitted to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow this year after possibly mistaking the capsules for jelly sweets . Dangers: Experts are calling for more childproof containers for the capsules to protect inquisitive youngsters . Shannon Hutchison ended up calling an ambulance for her seven-month-old daughter Orla who ate the contents of a tablet. Orla was rushed to intensive care and spent 10 days in hospital. 'Orla was at my sister's house playing with my two-year-old nephew who managed to get hold of one of these liquitabs. He thought it was a sweetie because it was bright and like a jelly, so he gave it to Orla who bit into it,"" Ms Hutchison said. 'Immediately we realised there was a problem as she was going in and out of consciousness, so phoned an ambulance right away. It was terrifying. I'm just so lucky to still have my little girl. 'Now I make sure that all the liquitabs are locked away and I tell everyone to do the same. 'The boxes they come in really should be child-proof and I hope manufacturers do something about this as I wouldn't want this to happen to any other little girl or boy.' Dr Fraser and his colleagues have published a letter in the medical journal Archives of Diseases in Childhood to alert medics and parents to the danger.","Five toddlers admitted to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow this year .

And though McKenzie has a rare genetic disease that keeps her in a wheelchair, she has a devoted dance partner in her father, who's waltzed her through many local pageants. In a video posted to YouTube June 17, which currently has more than four million views, the Dallas, Georgia, preteen is seen being twirled and dipped by her doting dad at a recent competition as they dance to Miley Cyrus's The Climb. McKenzie has mitochondrial disease, a debilitating condition that deprives the body of energy and damages cells in the heart, liver, skeletal muscles, respiratory systems and brain. Scroll down for video . On bended knee: Mike Carey dances with his 12-year-old daughter, McKenzie, who has a rare genetic disease . 'Dancing with daddy makes her feel like she’s on top of the world,' her father, Mike Carey, told Today.com. 'Pageants give her the same opportunity as other children and show people that she can accomplish anything with a little bit of help,' her mother, Tammy Carey, added. 'I just want the judges to look at her, not her wheelchair.' Ms Carey began entering McKenzie in pageants when she was five but it wasn't until 2010 that her father began joining her onstage. Uplifting video: A YouTube clip of Mike and McKenzie competing in a recent pageant has gone viral . 'My wife was sitting in the audience and was so stressed about McKenzie, so I decided to do something a little crazy,' Mr Carey told Today.com.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Emma Sohrabian was stunned when doctors told her they didn't know if her baby was a boy or a girl for three months . A mother was left stunned after doctors told her they didn't know if her baby was a boy or a girl - and they wouldn't be able to tell for another three months. Aolani Argyle appeared to have female genitals when she was born and doctors confirmed she was a girl. Quite understandably, her overjoyed mother Emma told all her family and friends she had a new daughter and bought pink baby clothes. But to her total disbelief, doctors then said they weren't sure of the baby's sex and needed to run tests. Aolani was three months old when the results eventually came back - confirming she was in fact a girl. Miss Sohrabian, 35, from Oxford, said: 'I didn't understand what they were talking about. I was also mortified - I'd told everyone I'd had a baby girl and I'd registered her birth when she was a few days old. 'At my 20 week scan I asked to find out the sex so I knew I was having a girl. I had everything for her. It was all pink and girlie - even her room. Doctors explained Aolani was showing signs of having a rare genetic condition called Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. The condition affects just one in 15,000 births and there is currently no known cure. It can be life-threatening because sufferers don't have the enzyme needed to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Without these hormones, the body produces more androgen, a type of male sex hormone.This can cause enlarged genitals, leading doctors to question Aolani's sex. Aolani, now 14 months old, was born 15 weeks premature at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. Doctors explained to Miss Sohrabian, who had been told she was having a girl, her baby could have a rare genetic illness that causes confusion over the gender . Aolani, now 14 months old, was also born 15 weeks premature. During the birth, her heart stopped beating and she had to be resuscitated . Miss Sohrabian suffered placenta previa during her pregnancy, a complication where the placenta grows in the lowest part of the womb, and doctors had to perform an emergency Caeserean section. During the birth, Aolani's heart stopped beating and she had to be resuscitated. Her mother also lost 14 pints of blood and needed several transfusions. Aolani, who weighed just 2lb when she was born, spent the first three months of her life in intensive care. Her mother said: 'I thought she had got through the worst then they dropped this big bombshell.'I had already been through enough without having this chucked at me as well.'I'd never heard of this condition but they told me both parents had to be carriers. 'When they explained how dangerous it could be, I was terrified. 'I didn't know what to do or think.' She faced an anxious wait before tests showed Aolani was a girl and she was later allowed to take her home. Tests to determine whether Aolani has congenital adrenal hyperplasia - a rare genetic condition that causes enlarged genitals - are ongoing . But she is still waiting for the results to find out if her daughter has congenital adrenal hyperplasia. If Aolani does, she can be given treatment to help manage the condition. Aolani, who also has several birthmarks, could also have surgery to help correct the abnormal appearance of her genitals. Miss Sohrabian said: 'They didn't go into too much detail about it. It's quite personal for her so it's something for her to decide when she's older. 'Before Aolani, I'd suffered a misscarriage so having her is a gift. 'Even if Aolani was a boy she would have been perfect to me. She's my beautiful little girl. It just took me by surprise. 'All I want is for her to be a happy, healthy baby.'Dr Fiona Ryan, a consultant in Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said: 'Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is caused by a genetic mutation, usually inherited from both parents. 'Individuals with CAH are deficient in a hormone called cortisol and lack of this hormone can be life threatening, especially during illness or after an accident. 'In the most common form of CAH androgen hormones are produced in excess and this can cause ambiguous genitalia at birth and difficulty in knowing if a baby is a boy or a girl.'","Aolani Argyle appeared to be female and doctors confirmed she was a girl .

"By . Nikki Murfitt . It’s the common cry of many a struggling dieter: ‘I live on salads yet I can’t shift the pounds.’ Those struggling with their weight also often blame ‘a slow metabolism’ for setting them back, but as a new TV series reveals, the answer may be far more simple. In the Channel 4 show Secret Eaters, hidden cameras record every  surreptitious nibble taken by participants. And when their eating habits aren’t being spied on at home, they are secretly tracked by two private detectives who take photographs of them sneaking crisps, cakes, fizzy drinks and takeaway meals. Breaking bad habits: Sisters Lauren, left, and Stephanie Spearman who have lost 11lbs and 10lbs respectively when they stopped snacking . ‘At the end of five days of surveillance, . Secret Eaters presenter Anna Richardson then takes the dieters to the . ‘Incident Room’, where everything they’ve eaten during that time is laid . out before them – damning evidence of the scale of their consumption. You can see the look of astonishment on their faces when they see the food they’ve actually consumed. They have no idea,’ says the show’s dietician Lynne Garton. ‘Snacks can add up to more than 500 calories a day but too often people get distracted by their busy lives and forget the chocolate bar or biscuit they ate earlier and it soon mounts up. Cutting out those calories can lead to a 1lb loss per week.’ Sisters Stephanie and Lauren Spearman, who appear in the first episode of the series, are a perfect example. Stephanie, 23, survived on junk food, while Lauren, 28, although regularly enjoying a drink and  chocolate bars, was training for the London Marathon. The thing they had in common was that despite their seemingly diverse eating habits, neither could lose weight. Secret snacks: Channel 4's new show follows the snackers every bite - and many are shocked when they find out how much they eat . It wasn’t until CCTV cameras captured . their daily routine that the sisters were faced with a shocking truth – . their snacking was so bad that within six months they would each have . gained more than 2st in weight. Lauren, who weighed 12st 9lb, says: ‘I thought I might go over the recommended calorie intake by a little but I assumed it would be cancelled out by my running. ‘In fact, I ate more than 14,000 calories in one week – over-eating by two day’s worth of calories.’ Desk munchies: Long hours in the office means many turn to snacks to get through the day . The advertising sales manager adds: ‘I . honestly had no idea. I was eating a chocolate bar every day at work but . how bad could it be? When I was told that added up to 2,575 calories a . week, I was horrified.’ As well as her bars at 515 calories each, Lauren’s alcohol intake during four nights out added another 500 daily calories, while meals out provided 1,500 more. Stephanie, a sales manager for High Street chain Matalan, weighed 12st 6lb when she contacted the programme. Her shift patterns at work meant she often skipped breakfast but would be so hungry by 11am that she would get a quick-fix from biscuits or cakes. Calorie-laden microwave meals and a vending machine provided a ready supply of snacks and fizzy drinks which, added to her fast-food takeaways, made up a total of 4,000 calories on some days – double the recommended intake for women. Dietician Lynne says: ‘Millions turn to the latest fad for a quick fix but to lose weight long-term requires a change in eating habits. 'Eating three meals a day and snacking only on healthy foods such as fruit can be all that’s needed to lose weight.’ Stephanie and Lauren, from Chelmsford, have taken on the advice they received on the programme and have lost 10lbs and 11lbs respectively. ‘We feel so much better since we’ve replaced sugary drinks with fizzy water, swapped crisps for fruit, and burgers for healthy sandwiches,’ says Stephanie. ‘I’ve managed to save £100 a month by not buying ready-meals and sugary snacks. We’re losing weight and we’re not even on a diet.’ Secret Eaters starts on Channel 4 on March 27.","Many dieters do not realise the calorie count of their daily snacking .

"By . Sebastian Shakespeare . Andy Murray split up with his coach Ivan Lendl and replaced the former Wimbledon finalist with Amelie Mauresmo. Now his mother Judy is ringing the changes off court. I hear the 54-year-old, self-confessed ‘white-hot blonde’ tennis coach has broken up with her long-term boyfriend, Phil Reid. Judy, who is said to be in the ‘advanced stage’ of talks to appear in the next series of Strictly Come Dancing, bought a £815,000 ‘dream’ home in Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, with the former badminton player in 2012. No more courting: Judy Murray, 54, has broken up with her long-term boyfriend, former badminton player Phil Reid, 48 . Sporting chance: Judy is said to be in the 'advanced stage' of talks to appear in the next series of Strictly Come Dancing . ‘I have no partner,’ is all she will tell me. It is not known if Judy has met anyone since her split from Reid, 48, who is high performance manager for the quango Sportscotland. Only last year, Judy wrote a gushing article about the ‘lovely’ romantic dinners she managed to squeeze into her busy schedule with ‘my long–term partner, Phil’. Her marriage to Andy’s father, Willie, an area manager for Scottish news-agent chain R. S. McColl, ended when the future Wimbledon champion was nine, a year after she became a full-time tennis coach. She was the one who left home, and Willie raised Andy, now 27, and his brother, fellow tennis professional Jamie, 28, for four years.

Growing up: Andy, now 27, and his brother, fellow tennis professional Jamie, 28,  were raised by their father Willie for four years . ‘I was away a lot and then you’re coaching until quite late in the evening,’ said Judy. ‘Your domestic life gets hit for six.’ The pair were divorced after a nine-year separation in 2005. Andy has said he always felt there was competition between his parents. ‘I would get stuck in the middle of their arguments,’ he said. ‘I would get really upset.’ Though Judy’s split from Willie was traumatic, their relationship has since become more cordial and they were pictured embracing at the dinner after  Andy’s historic Centre Court victory last year. Attraction: Much to Andy's embarrassment, Judy has expressed admiration for some of his peers on the tennis tour, particularly Feliciano Lopez, whom she nicknamed 'Deliciano' Judy does have an eye for a handsome man and, much to Andy’s embarrassment, has expressed carnal admiration for some of his peers on the tennis tour, particularly Feliciano Lopez, whom she nicknamed ‘Deliciano’. Last year, she posted the message ‘Deliciano alert’ on a social network like a love-struck fan. ‘Jaywalking on his phone in Eastbourne,’ she reported, with a photo of the player. She had earlier mentioned the Spaniard, drooling: ‘Ooooooh Deliciano . . . looking good out there.

"By . Claire Bates . A mother saved her seriously-ill son after she realised he could have a brain tumour by searching for his symptoms online. Sabina Jones, 31, knew there was something seriously wrong with her son, despite doctors diagnosing him first with a stomach bug and then with migraines. She pleaded with doctors to give him a CT scan, which revealed the cancer. Kian Jones needed an emergency operation at Birmingham Children's Hospital to remove the inch-long tumour. Kian (centre in hat) with his parents Dave and Sabina and sisters Mya and Tia. The schoolboy had started suffering persistent problems with vomiting, his vision and headaches during the summer . The schoolboy had started suffering persistent problems with vomiting, his vision and headaches during last summer . Mrs Jones and husband Dave said they took him to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital on three separate occasions, where his condition was firstly dismissed as a stomach infection - and then as migraines. Sabina, from Shrewbury, said the tumour was only discovered in mid-October when she trusted her mother's intuition and pleaded for further tests. Mrs Jones questioned why the tumour wasn't found earlier. She said: 'I was on the computer Googling and looking up symptoms of persistent headaches and vomiting and the site said your GP would normally refer you for a CT scan to rule out anything serious. 'We were quite angry because we felt no one was listening to us. Kian is hoping to start playing football again after he finishes cancer treatment . 'My husband did get angry and we did get a letter of apology from the doctor that said it was migraines. 'I can understand the first time when he went in. But for it to happen again with the same symptoms and him constantly being sick, I though they would do more tests. 'Had we not pushed for the scan, things could have been very different. I think that sometimes they are too quick to fob it off as something that is not important. It is a bit scary really.' When he was first admitted to hospital . on September 1 last year, Sabina said they were told by doctors Kian . may have been suffering some form of gastroenteritis. He is now on the road to recovery and undergoing regular chemotherapy as part of his treatment. Sabina said the family would be attending a meeting with hospital bosses to discuss how the tumour was missed and to seek reassurances the problem will not happen again. She added: 'He is dealing with it amazingly. He is going to school all day every day, other than when he has got hospital appointments. 'He still sees his friends and he wants to try and get as much normality as he can. His school have been brilliant and his close friends have been brilliant. 'He absolutely loves football. They have said hopefully when it is all sorted, he will be able to play again.' A spokesman for The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said: 'While we cannot comment specifically on this case, we can confirm that our priority is to make sure people have timely access to safe, high quality services when they need them. 'Brain tumours in children are very rare and can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be similar to those that occur with other much more common and less serious childhood illnesses. 'We have invited the family to meet with the Trust to discuss their concerns and this offer remains open to them.' Friends and family have already organised a charity fun day and a walk up Snowdon to raise funds for Brain Tumour Research. They also hope to pay for a dream holiday to Florida for Kian - after the family were forced to cancel a planned trip to Mexico this summer due to his condition.","Kian suffered with headaches, vomiting and blurry vision last Summer .

"A breakfast truck today highlighted food waste by handing out free smoothies and juices made from fruit which would otherwise have been thrown away. Leftover ingredients such as oranges, apples, coconut milk and natural yoghurt were mixed together to form four recipes. Smoothies such as the ‘Use me up, Honey’ and juices such as ‘Luscious Leftovers’ were served up for the first time in London today. Scroll down for video . The truck uses leftover oranges, apples, coconut milk and natural yoghurt to make smoothies . All the food and drink sourced for the recipes comes from FoodCycle - a national food bank charity . They are being given out as part of the Waste & Resources Action Programme’s Love Food Hate Waste campaign highlighting wastage across the nation. It follows government figures this week that one million tonnes of food and drink are tossed away each year - costing the UK more than £2.4bn. And almost half of this wastage comes from whole or unopened fresh vegetables and salads, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs funded report. Smoothies such as the 'Use me up, Honey' and juices like 'Luscious Leftovers' were served up for the first time in London today . In London alone, more than half a million tonnes of food and drink are thrown away annually - costing Londoners over £1bn. That alone amounts to a staggering £40m cost to London boroughs in reprocessing and disposing of the waste. But customers can now get a taste of leftover foods when they try a fruity smoothie or juice from the ‘Liquid Greens Machine’ truck. Emma Marsh, head of the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, said: 'The Liquid Greens Machine is just one example of a creative way for people to experiment with good food and drink. 'They should try making something delicious and different and, by doing just one thing differently, we can all help tackle the issue of food waste.'

"By . Emma Innes . Salisbury District Hospital developed its own moisturising cream for patients recovering from burns . An NHS hospital has become the first in Britain to sell a product commercially in a bid to make money. Salisbury District Hospital, in Wiltshire, developed its own moisturising cream for patients recovering from skin grafts and burns. The hospital has used the sunflower oil-based product for 24 years, since it was created by staff in the hospital's pharmacy. It has proved so popular with patients since then, that the decision has been taken to sell it to the wider public. The lotion, which has now been given a lavender scent, is being called 'My Trusty Little Sunflower Cream' and will cost £6.99 per tube. Profits from the sales will be reinvested in patient care. The cream works by replacing the skin's essential fatty acids which improves its texture. Currently, 20,000 tubes have been manufactured and the cream is available through the hospital's website. A spokeswoman for the hospital said the cream, which . contains five per cent sunflower oil, was an alternative to expensive . beauty creams. It has also not been tested on animals and does not . contain perfume. Malcolm Cassells, finance director for the Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, said tens of thousands of pounds had already been invested in the product. He said: ‘I would be disappointed if we hadn't recuperated our costs within the next couple of months. The hospital has used the sunflower oil-based product for 24 years and it has proved so popular with patients they have decided to sell it to the wider public . All profits from the sales will be reinvested in patient care . ‘We've invested in PR and marketing . advisers to take us through the process as well as manufacturing quite a . large number of tubes ready for the launch.’ He added: ‘We don't claim clinical . properties for this cream, we claim it only as a moisturiser but we know . this product is really good. ‘It . has been popular with patients ever since we invented it and many have . asked to have it available for purchase after their discharge.’ A hospital spokeswoman said: ‘We just thought the time was right for it to be released.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health said the cream was the first commercial venture by an NHS hospital as far as they were aware.","Salisbury District Hospital has developed its own moisturising cream for skin graft and burns patients .

"By . Liz Hull . Gillian Given, 58, died in July 2012 two hours after an NHS Direct nurse told her that she did not need an ambulance . A retired nurse died in agony two hours after being refused an ambulance by NHS Direct even though she was screaming with pain. Gillian Given could be heard howling in the background of a harrowing phone call made by her husband James which was played to an inquest. NHS Direct nurse Deborah Evans, who took the call, asked him a series of computer-prompted questions then told him: ‘I appreciate she is in pain but she doesn’t need an ambulance.’ Even when Mrs Given herself begged the nurse for help Mrs Evans refused to send an ambulance but told her to take painkillers and wait for her GP. Mrs Given, 58, died minutes before the doctor arrived after suffering a massive heart attack due to a blockage in an artery. Yesterday, after a coroner ruled human error amounting to neglect played a part in her death, Mr Given said his ‘caring’ wife – a former hospital sister – had been dedicated to the NHS for 22 years, but was failed by it when she needed it most. He believes she would be alive today if an ambulance had been sent. ‘She was effectively begging for her life, crying on the telephone because she was in so much pain, but still they refused to send an ambulance,’ he said. ‘My wife was fit and healthy until that day, but now she is just another statistic. I’ve had no apology, nobody in the Health Service seems to care. ‘Gillian’s death has been devastating. We had plans to enjoy our retirement and grow old together, but now that’s all gone. My wife was a caring person. 'She was always the first person to help if someone was in trouble or ill. She would do anything for anyone. A post mortem examination revealed that Gillian Given was suffering from severe heart disease . 'She devoted most of her working life to the NHS and they failed her terribly in her hour of need. The NHS today is a shambles.’ The . inquest heard that Mrs Given fell ill in the morning of July 16 last . year at the couple’s home in Belgrano, near Abergele, north Wales. The former nurse, who had to retire because of arthritis but had no previous history of heart problems, was vomiting and complaining of agonising pains in her abdomen and lower back. When she was no better by the afternoon Mr Given, 66, a retired publican, telephoned the couple’s GP surgery for advice. Grieving: James Given, left, is to sue the Welsh ambulance service over the death of his wife Gillian, right . The receptionist told him that Dr Jon Evans would call at their home later that day, but advised him to dial 999 if Mrs Given needed urgent help. Bosses of a GP out-of-hours service which fiddled its figures hundreds of times handed themselves huge bonuses, it has emerged. Christopher Hyman, chief executive of Serco which is responsible for out-of-hours GP services in Cornwall, was awarded the performance-related sum of £812,250 on top of his £700,000 annual salary. A report by MPs today reveals that last year the firm fiddled its figures on 252 separate occasions to cover up poor care. This data included the number of patients who were able to see a doctor as well as how long they were made to wait. The Public Accounts Committee report reveals that the figures were made to look so good that another unnamed manager at Serco was handed a bonus for his performance. It also accuses managers at Serco of trying to root out whistleblowers who had raised concerns about poor care. At around 3pm Mr Given dialled 999, but when he asked for an ambulance his call was triaged and put through to Mrs Evans at the NHS Direct call centre in Swansea for assessment. NHS Direct Wales is part of the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust. After asking the couple, who had been together for more than 30 years, a series of computerised questions Mrs Evans decided against sending an ambulance. When questioned by coroner John Gittins, Mrs Evans admitted it was ultimately the computer and not the nurse who decided whether an ambulance should be dispatched. However, she said that, on occasion, she had not agreed with the computer’s findings. Asked whether she had felt any ‘gut instinct’ that an ambulance should have been called, Mrs Evans, who resigned soon after the tragedy, replied: ‘Yes.’ Stephanie Kneath, a manager with NHS Direct, said not enough questions had been asked of Mrs Given about the length of time she had been in pain and exactly where the pain was. Asked by the coroner whether nurses could deviate from the computer programme, Mrs Kneath replied: ‘The system is to support their clinical knowledge.’ The inquest at Ruthin town hall on Tuesday was also told that the call centre was noisy at times which could stop nurses hearing responses clearly. Mrs Given died of severe atheroma – a blockage most commonly caused by cholesterol deposits or swelling of the arteries – and left ventricular failure. Happier times: Mr and Mrs Given are pictured on their wedding day in 1998 . Recording a verdict of death from natural causes, Mr Gittins said human error, which amounted to neglect, had played a part in Mrs Given’s death. He added that he would be recommending the ambulance trust examine the working environment at the call centre to improve soundproofing. Mrs Given worked as a sister at the now closed Cranage Hall NHS hospital for the mentally ill in Cheshire for 22 years before retiring in 1993. Mr Given said: ‘Dr Evans told the hearing it’s likely my wife would be here today if they had sent an ambulance. 'She could have had an injection to remove the blockage if she had been seen sooner, but the two-hour delay proved fatal.’ However, the coroner said he doubted whether paramedics would have carried or been able to administer such an injection. Mr Given is suing the Welsh ambulance service for compensation. A spokesman for the service said they extended their ‘deepest sympathies’ to the family and would be reviewing their arrangements for keeping noise to a minimum in their centres.

"By . Sara Malm . and Michael Zennie . A man who underwent surgery to remove his 132lbs scrotum has said it has made his life a misery after the operation left him with a one-inch penis. Wesley Warren Jr. was so desperate to rid himself of the ten stone testicles that he considered selling them on eBay to pay for the operation. Fortunately for the 48-year-old a team of surgeons in California agreed to carry out the 13-hour operation for free - but Mr Warren is not happy about the results. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Unhappy: Wesley Warren expected his life to be transformed after he had his 132 lbs scrotum removed, but the surgery has left him 'disfigured' Before the operation Mr Warren, from Las Vegas, struggled with the simplest of tasks and was forced to wear a hooded top as trousers to fit his giant scrotum. Now however, he says he will never be able to have a relationship with a woman again after the surgery reduced his penis to an inch long. 'I know the majority of people are probably expecting me to express extreme happiness and glee that my life has been transformed since the sac has been removed - but it’s not as simple as that,' he told The Sun. 'I’m grateful to have been pulled out of the fire, I was getting burned, but now I’m dealing with the first degree burns. I’m still disfigured.' Talking about his life before the operation he describes himself as a prisoner to his testicles and that the growth ruled his life.

'There . are a lot of shows about makeovers, but this is a real makeover,' Dr. Gelman, who heads the Center for Reconstructive Urology at the . University of California, Irvine, said of the procedure. 'He's basically a new man.' For sale: Mr Warren initially considered selling his scrotum on eBay in order to pay for surgery . On April 8, Dr Gelman and three other . physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective . sac of skin and muscles that contained Warren's testicles and penis, . according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. The mass caused by the condition, known as scrotal lymphedema, had grown to 132 pounds in less than two years. Mr Warren, who has blood pressure problems and asthma, had previously spoken of his fear of dying during surgery. The watermelon-size scrotum Mr Warren . carried between his legs landed him on the Howard Stern Show and Comedy . Central and made him a local celebrity in his hometown. When Warren spoke with a reporter for the Las Vegas Review-Journal in . October 2011, he became emotional as he described the pain and . humiliation of carrying the deformed genitals. He said he suffered from . deep bouts of depression and health complications. Basking in fame: Mr Warren's unusual handicap led to him becoming a local celebrity . Fear: Warren was also afraid of dying on the operating table or losing his penis and his testicles if the complex procedure went wrong . His . penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to . urinate on himself and said only wanted to urinate like a normal man and have a romantic relationship with a woman. 'I don't like being a freak, who would?' he told the Review-Journal. The . massive swelling was caused by fluid building up in his scrotum. Doctors . had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his . scrotum. There was . also a chance that complications could force the surgeons to cut off his . genitals if his scrotum didn't stop bleeding. 'I still haven't lost a patient or a testicle (in patients with problems similar to Warren's),' Dr Gelman told the Review Journal. The extremely rare condition is much more common in Africa and Southeast Asia, where it is caused by parasites, than it is in the western world. Mr Warren says he contracted it somehow when he hit his testicle with his own leg while turning in bed one morning but Dr Gelman said he 'had no idea' how the man contracted it.

"By . George Rush . Determined: Just like his Breaking Bad character, R.J. Mitte has cerebral palsy - but that has not stopped him . The near-hysterical screams that met actor R.J. Mitte on the red carpet at the Golden Globes this year were befitting of a bona fide teenage heart-throb. The strikingly handsome 20-year-old now takes such adulation in his stride, having been a fixture for the past five years in the critically acclaimed US TV drama series Breaking Bad – the nail-biting conclusion of which will be screened next month. His nuanced and at times heartbreaking portrayal of a young disabled man, Walt Junior, struggling to cope with his father’s terminal cancer and his own physical problems, has won him unanimous praise. However, what marks out R.J. – real name, Roy Frank – is that he has the same disability as his character on screen: cerebral palsy (CP). The neurological condition normally occurs before or during birth for a number of reasons – usually lack of blood supply and therefore oxygen – meaning parts of the brain die or do not develop. The damage leads to, among other things, problems with muscle development, control and movement. In Breaking Bad, Walt Jnr relies on crutches. But, while R.J. spent his childhood in leg braces – CP causes involuntary muscle contractions that can lead to difficulty in straightening the limbs – his love of sport and exercise means that he now walks unaided. A third of those with CP have difficulty with speech, but in a similar way, Walt Jnr’s problems are slightly worse than R.J.’s. The show’s creator, Vince Gilligan,  loosely based the character on a  college friend who suffered a more severe form of CP, but had initially been auditioning able-bodied actors. After five auditions, R.J. landed the part. ‘It took a little bit of convincing, as at first Vince thought I was actually too able-bodied,’ R.J. says, explaining how he ‘regressed’ to his early days with CP by using crutches again and staying up late so grogginess would thicken his voice. ‘Playing Walt Jnr has been an eye-opener to what I’ve managed to become. Until I got the role, I never thought what I went through was something odd.’ Now he does ‘tons of yoga’ to fight leg stiffness and takes a prescription drug to relax his muscles. The approach is working. ‘If I stopped doing what I’m doing, it would get worse,’ says R.J. ‘I can’t tell you the last time I’ve gone to a doctor for my CP. I have it under control for the most part.’ At first there was nothing to suggest R.J., who was adopted a few weeks after his birth, had problems. But by the time he turned three, he had begun showing signs of impairment. ‘I had really bad elasticity in my legs,’ says R.J., who grew up in Louisiana. When he began to walk, he would tip-toe, something commonly seen in CP children due to tightness in the tendons. ‘He also had very rigid fingers,’ his mother Dyna remembers. ‘I had him tested [for brain impairment] but he scored really high on all of the tests. Most CP kids are very intelligent – it’s a misconception that they aren’t.’ When he took on the role as fellow cerebral palsy sufferer Walt Jr, son of the main character Walter White, R.J. had to learn how to walk on crutches and slur his voice as his own condition is less severe than Walt Jr . Eventually they were given a diagnosis, but faced a further challenge. Under the terms of R.J.’s adoption the identity of his mother was confidential. ‘We had to go through a lot of red tape to give us the information the doctors needed,’ says Dyna. ‘We eventually found out R.J.’s mother was in labour a long time and finally had to have an emergency caesarean.’ When he was delivered, R.J. wasn’t breathing and had to be resuscitated. The event left permanent brain damage. Once his condition was diagnosed, doctors immediately tried to straighten his feet so that he no longer needed to walk on his toes. ‘They would bend them into place and put casts on,’ he says. ‘After a week or two, they would cut off the casts, bend my feet more, and then cast them again. It was very painful and this went on for six months.’ Dyna also sent her son to speech therapists and tried every exercise that might improve his hand-eye co-ordination, which can sometimes be affected. ‘She had me folding 30 or 40 towels and then she’d knock them over and I would fold them again,’ R.J says. He didn’t resent the drill – ‘I wouldn’t be same person if I didn’t have someone pushing me.’ In spite of all this, R.J. insists: ‘I never thought of myself as being different. I just thought that putting on braces was one more thing that I had to do to get ready for the day.’ Dyna was adamant that he attend mainstream school and dedicated herself to helping him. ‘When we found out he had cerebral palsy, I sat down and cried,’ she recalls. Family support: The 20 year old actor and his mum Dyna who brought him up as a single mother . ‘I was a single mother, as my husband . and I separated after we adopted  R.J. I thought, “How am I going to do . this?” I called my aunt, who’s in the medical profession, and she said, . “Cry yourself silly today, then get up tomorrow and start doing . research. Find everything that’s out there. Raise him as normal as . possible. And never let him believe that he can’t achieve what he . wants.” So that’s what I did.’ Attending . a mainstream school was a mixed blessing. ‘Most kids rallied around . him,’ says Dyna. ‘But there were times when he’d come home and cry.’ A . scene in the first series of Breaking Bad involves Walt Snr, played by . Emmy award-winning actor Bryan Cranston, confronting older teenagers who . are taunting his son. It was a scenario that rang true for R.J. ‘I was a prime target for bullies,’ he admits. Indeed, some children physically assaulted him, resulting in him suffering a broken hand. Every few years, a doctor would suggest the possibility of surgery – something about a third of children with CP undergo. There are operations to release tendons in the legs and arms, freeing movement, and procedures to realign hips and straighten the spine. Dr Chaniyil Ramesh, a consultant paediatrician at Watford General Hospital who specialises in CP, explains: ‘Surgery improves quality of life in about half of patients. The condition can get worse again over time. Botox injections, which relax the muscles, have to be repeated every three months. The one treatment we know works incredibly well is regular exercise. This improves symptoms in all cases.’ Cases of CP are on the  rise, which is thought to be linked to the increase in  multiple pregnancies as a  result of fertility treatment. A twin birth increases the risk of CP tenfold, as one foetus can starve the other of oxygen. The charity Scope says that about 1,800 children in the UK are diagnosed every year. Symptoms vary: some people have problems walking while others are profoundly disabled and require lifelong care.  Speech is affected in a third of cases, but this has no bearing  on intellectual development. In some cases, those  with the condition suffer  epileptic seizures and, rarely, learning disabilities. In R.J.’s case, doctors suggested cutting . his Achilles tendon but instead he threw himself into sport, especially . football. ‘I was goalie for a bit then played centre-forward. I had no . trouble running. When I was 14 I just said to my doctors, “I don’t need . these leg braces any more.” ’ That year, Dyna moved the family to Los Angeles as her daughter, Lacianne, had received a film offer. To meet friends, R.J. started looking for acting jobs and became an extra on the hit Disney show Hannah Montana, where he played one of Miley Cyrus’s classmates. Talent manager Addison K. Witt, who himself has a form of CP, and agent Debra Manners, encouraged R.J. to take acting classes. Dyna recalls: ‘I pulled the agent aside and said, “I’m not sure this is for him – to go to audition after audition and get turned down.” But she said, “I love him. I’m not afraid to say he has cerebral palsy.  I think you need to let him try.” ’ Shortly afterwards, R.J. landed the part in Breaking Bad. According to Gilligan, R.J. is ‘like cat-nip’ to the female cast members and crew. He also has legions of female fans among the show’s millions of viewers. ‘I’ve never had any trouble getting girls, which is not to say I haven’t had girl trouble,’ laughs R.J., who is currently single after ending a two-year relationship. His growing fame has now spurred him to activism and he’s become a spokesman for US charity United Cerebral Palsy, campaigning for the  inclusion of disabled actors, and the portrayal of disability in drama. Able-bodied actors are often praised for such roles (Daniel Day-Lewis played Irish artist Christy Brown in My Left Foot and Eddie Redmayne will soon star as physicist Stephen Hawking, who has motor neurone disease) yet disabled Hollywood stars are few and far between. R.J. is all too aware of his   position in a show watched regularly by three million people. ‘So many people are disabled but we’re all capable of doing something in our own way,’ he says. ‘I can’t tell you how many times a doctor said to me, “You’re not going to be able to do this.” It only made me determined to say that I would do it. My disability made me who I am today. ‘Hollywood shouldn’t be afraid of actors like me. Diversity can only make the stories better.’","Actor Roy Frank 'R.J.'

"By . Bianca London . She's the heir to a multi-billion pound empire and living in the fast lane is something Tamara Ecclestone knows all about. So, when it came to celebrating her 30th birthday last night, the heiress didn't do things by half measures. The socialite, model and television personality threw a lavish party with her husband, Jay Rutland, mother Slavica, sister Petra, brother-in-law James Stunt, as well as the likes of rapper P Diddy and comedian Michael McIntyre. Scroll down for video . What a soiree! Formula 1 heiress Tamara Eccleston, pictured with her husband Jay Rutland, threw a lavish 30th birthday in London last night . P Diddy, who can cost around £700,000 for an hour's set, was flown in by Tamara to perform especially for her party at the trendy ME Hotel on London's Strand, while Michael McIntyre, who can command between £30,000 - £40,000 for trotting out an hour of material, provided the comedy. It would seem Tamara had her heart set on the roof terrace location at the trendy London hotel, which can accomodate 240 guests and has stunning views of the London skyline. A member of public had originally booked the rooftop location for a birthday party a few weeks in advance, but two days before the event was due to take place, the hotel called to cancel the booking, saying they had double booked. Golden girl: The British socialite, model and television personality positively dazzled in a gold mini dress as she arrived at the ME Hotel to celebrate her big birthday . Look who stopped by! P Diddy was flown in by Tamara to perform especially for her party . Providing the laughs: English comedian, Michael McIntyre, was also on hand to perform at the ME London hotel . The hotel clearly preferred the idea of the celebrity event to the original booking and the other party was moved to a downstairs location in the hotel. To make up for their disappointment, ME London reportedly gave the member of public £1,000 towards the cost of their party in compensation, according to a source. Speaking to MailOnline about having her party moved, Danni Woolner said: 'My husband had booked the bar for my birthday and we received an email from the bar manager telling us that they had to cancel it to make way for a bigger event. 'We weren’t told that it was Tamara Ecclestone’s birthday, but I was obviously quite disappointed. The bar then offered us the restaurant as an alternative venue and we were compensated.' Tamara's management, however, deny such a rumour. A spokesman for the heiress said: 'There was no double booking and no one was paid off. 'The venue was available when we looked into it as a possible location several months ago and it was still available when we went ahead and confirmed the booking, there was no other party interested in the same date.'

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Quorn, soya and tofu - It seems they have all had their day as protein-rich meat substitutes. Now, one Austrian woman claims that the new super food set to take over our kitchen counters is maggots. And she has developed a new machine to make cooking up dishes much easier. Scroll down for video . The Farm 432 device can harvest half a kilogram of larvae every week, which is enough for two meals. The woman behind the Farm 432 device, Katharina Unger, said the machine is designed to be the perfect environment for flies and their larvae allowing in enough light and space for them to grow . The woman behind the Farm 432 device is Katharina Unger, an industrial design graduate of University of Applied Arts in Vienna, who wants to tackle the factory farmed meat industry by growing protein at home. The Farm 432 device can harvest half a kilogram of larvae every week, which is enough for two meals. She describes the cooked larvae as smelling like starchy potatoes with a nutty and meaty taste. The machine is designed to be the perfect environment for flies and their larvae allowing in enough light and space for them to grow. Katharina Unger recommends eating the larvae with tomato risotto. 'I like to mix parboiled rice with wild rice together with the larvae, put a lot of tomato sauce in it and a bit of parmesan cheese,' she said . By 2050 meat production will need to increase by 50 per cent to meet population increase. Katharina Unger predicts that because we . already use one third of croplands for the production of animal feed, . it will be necessary to develop alternative food sources and production . methods. The United Nations is in agreement. In a . recent report, it suggests that insects are a viable source of protein . for humans, animals and pets. The report highlighted grasshoppers, . ants and other bugs as protein-packed substitutes that are less harmful . to the environment than traditional meat. While the current design is for home use, the system can be scaled up for professional kitchens. It is also easy enough for anyone to use, she says. To begin with, you simply drop some black soldier fly larvae into an appliance chamber. Here they grow and then move to a larger chamber, mate and produce larva. This falls down into a separate area, where it matures, moves on up a tube, and falls into a cup. Some larvae are dropped back into the machine to restart the process, while the rest are ready to eat. Black Soldier flies were chosen as they are easy to breed and contain up to 42 per cent protein  -  double the amount in the average chicken breast - and a high level of calcium and amino acids. A gram of Black Soldier fly eggs can become 2.4 kilograms of edible protein after 432 hours in the Farm 432. But if Black Soldier flies aren’t to your taste then other larvae may be used in the same way. The cooked larvae are said to smell like starchy potatoes and have a nutty and meaty taste .

Janice Dickinson had her 30-year-old implants updated on Botched, a new TV show starting on E! Many doctors would have deemed Janice's botched boob job 'unfixable' but in the IN new series doctors tackle surgery mishaps and mistakes that other medical experts have dismissed. Janice is no stranger to surgery having had a facelift, browlift, breast augmentation, tummy tuck and fillers however, the ex-model said that her botched boob job had not put her off more surgery. Of her previous breast surgery she said: 'Sylvester Stallone paid for those, so I figured why not?' Janice decided to go in for more surgery after she noticed a 'ripple' begin to form around her implants . Demanding: Dr Terry Dubrow says that Janice was one of the most difficult patients he had ever had . Recovered addict, Janice, really struggled with her sobriety during the procedure . Janice consulted plastic surgeons Dr Paul Nassif and Dr Terry Dubrow (Dubrow is a fixture on The Real Housewives of Beverely Hills) of Botched when fixing her sagging breasts. Shortly after her first procedure Janice had noticed some 'rippling' occuring around the edge of her implants. Janice's breast implants were over 30-years-old well exceeding doctor's recomendations to have implants replaced every 10-15 years. According to Pagesix.com Dr Terry Dubrow was in shock with Janice's behaviour on the show. Dr Terry Dubrow was extremely concerned about Janice's demands for drugs whilst she was in the hospital .

During the programme Dubrow shows concerns for Janice's insisting on more pain killers, pointing out that after three days in the hospital most people would be on aspirin. 'I don’t give a s*** about most people' is Janice's response which prompts Dubrow to question Janice's sobriety referring to her drug-fueled past. 'The ex-addict is coming out,' the doctor explains 'We've got post-operative pain management problems … This is classic drug-seeking behavior.' Janice returns for another check-up, where she reveals she has no recollection of the previous week and is unaware as to whether she broke her sobreity or not.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . As well as a seven-bedroom manor house and more than 10 acres of land, this quintessentially British property, on the market for £3m, comes with its own slice of history too. Rookley Manor, a Grade II-listed 18th-century house, which boasts pristine gardens, a swimming pool, and paddocks, has played host to some of the country's most famous VIPs - including royalty. Former visitors include George IV (played by Ralph Fiennes in the 2008 film The Duchess) who regularly took his mistress Maria Fitzherbert to the property when he was still the Prince of Wales. Stunning grounds: Rookley Manor in Hampshire comes with its own slice of incredible British history . For sale: The Grade II-listed house is on the market with more than 10 acres of land . And his uncle, the HRH Duke of Cumberland, rented the house as a hunting lodge from 1776-1783. Perched on the outskirts of the hamlet of Up Somborne in Hampshire, the property also attracted literary greats, with William Makepeace Thackeray writing Vanity Fair while staying at the house. Now up for sale, Rookley Manor, near the village of Kings Somborne and the market town of Stockbridge, is just an hour by train from Winchester to London Waterloo. The brochure describes the property and surrounding grounds as an idyllic country pile, with golf courses nearby, racing at Salisbury and Newbury on offer, polo at Tidworth, point to point at Larkhill, motor racing at Thruxton, fishing at the Rivers Test and Itchen, and sailing on the south coast. Quintessentially British: The avenue of apple trees that decorate the garden of the 17th-century house . Important guests: The 12-seater table set for an evening of fine dining inside the manor . The approach to the magnificent house is a sweeping gravel driveway. Through the front door, the beautiful hallway has an intricate artex ceiling, a 17th-century flagstone and marble floor, as well as a stunning open fireplace. Off the hallway is the sitting room, which again has an open fireplace as well as sash windows, a dining room and drawing room, perfect for entertaining guests. There’s also a 17th-century oak staircase and a large window with its original iron decoration. Upstairs, the principle bedroom has its original 18th-century fireplace and panelling, and an adjoining bathroom with views across the pristine gardens and on to an avenue of apple trees. The impressive hallway features an artex ceiling - and plenty of space for hats . Next to the main house is a cottage, which overlooks a small courtyard. But what the sellers are really hoping will capture the imagination of potential buyers about this historical house are the beautiful grounds. There are perfectly manicured lawns, two orchards of old apple trees, two walled gardens (one of which is a productive kitchen garden with greenhouse and fruit cage), a 300-year-old Mulberry tree, a tennis court, an L-shaped swimming pool and two fenced paddocks. The property is on the market for £2,950,000 with agents Strutt & Parker.","Rookley .

On the product's website, amid mentions of 'cutting-edge science' and claims that the serum 'recaptures the key signs of youth,' its 'proof' section is merely a handful of consumer testimonials, including, from an 'Anonymous' user: 'This is the most amazing product, I will never go without it again.' As for L’Oréal's Youth Code serum, which is priced much cheaper at $25 a container, 'ten years of gene research' has led the company to claim: 'We now have the knowledge to help you begin cracking the code to younger acting skin.' According to a print advertisement for the product - which begs the question: 'Imagine, what if you could grow young?' - the serum 'boosts skin’s natural powers of regeneration so it regains the qualities of young skin.' Tall claims: L'Oréal has boasted that this Lancôme serum (pictured), which costs up to $132, is 'clinically proven to boost genes,' resulting in 'visibly younger skin' in just a week . Under the settlement, L’Oréal is now prohibited from claiming that its products 'affect genes' unless they are supported by scientific evidence, according to the FTC, and from making any statements that misrepresent the results of any test or study. The cosmetics company, who launched Génifique in 2009, and Youth Code in 2010, maintains that some of these advertising claims were already discontinued some time ago. It also said that no fines had been ordered, and it didn't admit any improper advertising practices. 'It would be nice if cosmetics could alter our genes and turn back time. But L'Oréal couldn’t support these claims' It's not the first time L’Oréal has been forced to back down after making over-inflated claims regarding its cosmetics and skincare. In 2007, it withdrew advertising in Australia which touted the 'wrinkle removal' capabilities of its products . And in the UK the same year, the company also found itself in hot water for claiming its Telescopic mascara makes lashes '60per cent longer,' in ad featuring Penelope Cruz, who was in fact wearing false eyelashes. The Government-run FTC describes itself as 'the nation's consumer protection agency,' and 'takes complaints about businesses that don't make good on their promises or cheat people out of money.'",The cosmetics giant is now prohibited from claiming that its Génifique and Youth Code  products 'affect' or 'target' genes .
"By . Lucy Waterlow . The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall looked in high spirits as they stepped out to meet locals on the second day of their annual summer tour of Wales. The couple strolled arm in arm as they kicked off their busy day at the newly restored 13th century St Illtud's Church in the Vale of Glamorgan. The church, in Llantwit Major, was founded in 500AD by the Welsh monk Illtud and is believed to be Britain's earliest centre of learning. Arm in arm: The royal couple on the second day of their annual summer tour of Wales . Lean on me: The Duchess of Cornwall held her husband's arm they walked down the ancient steps of St Illtud's Church . Little princesses: The couple were greeted by locals in Llantwit Major including these young girls who dressed up especially . Crowning glory: School children in homemade crowns welcomed the royals . Can we go to the park yet? This dog seemed nonplussed by the royal visit until Camilla paid the pooch some special attention . Animal lover: The Duchess was happy to meet some other dogs who waited with their owners . During the visit, Camilla held onto Charles as the royal couple ventured down the ancient steps. The Duchess wore a summery floral pleat skirt with a cream blazer - an outfit she wore last year when visiting the Wimbledon tennis tournament. She also wore her favourite pearl choker necklace and matching earrings. Her prince was equally smart in a grey suit and tie. The royal couple were greeted in Llantwit Major by dozens of schoolchildren who lined the streets as the local Royal Air Force band played. Keeping her entertained: Camilla shares a joke with some of the school children . Welcome party: The Duchess talks to another group of children waving Welsh flags . Visit: The Duchess crouched down to speak to children from a local playgroup . Milly Harry, three, wore a crown for the occasion but became shy upon meeting Camilla at Gilly Beans playgroup. Animal lover Camilla stopped to stroke a number of dogs who waited patiently while their owners greeted the royal couple. Reverend Huw Butler showed the couple around the restored grounds and led a 10 minute service for them. 'Today history is being made,' he said. Charles and Camilla visited the newly restored 13th century St Illtud's Church in the Vale of Glamorgan . King of Spades: The royal couple helped plant a tree . 'As far as we know this is the first royal visit for this church.' Charles asked whether the Celtic Christian stones had attracted many visitors and was told tourists from America and Australia had already travelled to see them. The couple left the bright sunshine of Llantwit Major after being presented with a wicker hamper filled with local produce. Charles then visited Sony UK Technology Centre in Pencoed, Bridgend, Wales, marking the 40th anniversary of the factory. The Prince played a key role in bringing the factory to Wales after suggesting a plant in the country to Akio Morita in 1972 while on tour to Japan. Paparazzi prince! Charles tests a TV camera on a visit to the Sony Technology Centre in Bridgend . Tables turned: The prince got behind the camera to snap the press who were following him on his visit . The factory, in which Sony employs 340 people, produces broadcast and professional cameras and Charles was keen to get behind the lens. He first picked up a Sony HDC2500 broadcast camera - a model used in the World Cup - and swung it towards media covering the visit. 'It's heavy,' he exclaimed. He met factory workers around the site, including team leader Julie Bunney, 34, from Gilfach Goch, who started working at the factory aged 17. 'It was a honour to meet His Royal Highness, I was so excited about it,' Ms Bunney said. 'I was really nervous at first but I really enjoyed it and I was so honoured to meet him.' Ms Bunney leads a team of staff working on the Raspberry Pi, a £24 credit card sized mini-computer which is popular with hobbyists and developers. 'The Raspberry Pi came to us two years ago and we have made two million,' she added. 'We make one every 11 seconds.' New career path? Charles seemed to enjoy his stint as a photographer . Good work: He admires the stills camera during his tour of the factory . After admiring the Pi, Charles was introduced to Sony's range of stills camera - and picked up one to take a photograph of the Sun's royal photographer, Arthur Edwards. 'It's quite heavy, isn't it?' he asked Mr Edwards. 'This is a change for me,' he said as he aimed the camera towards Mr Edwards and pretended to take a shot. 'You look much better on the screen,' he joked. Charles was also intrigued by Wales Interactive, a games developer based on the second floor of the sprawling Sony site. Entrepreneur David Banner, managing director of the company, told Charles how they had produced the first Welsh language game. 'That looks terrifying,' Charles said as he watched a developer create characters for a game. The prince was also given a screening of First World War footage, which has been restored by Dragon. He also watched footage taken inside a steelworks in 1947. In a speech made as he unveiled a plaque at the factory, Charles paid tribute to Sony and congratulated the company on 40 years in Wales. 'I am thrilled to have this chance of visiting this new plant because the old one I opened is somewhere else all together,' he told assembled staff. 'They don't make televisions here anymore but you are brilliantly mending all sorts of people's broken or bent equipment and I was so impressed how you can find out the fault within five minutes and put it right. 'That makes most of us feel rather ashamed I think with our inability to handle all of this technology. Not only that, but the fact you make such high quality and high performing cameras, which I've found myself usually at the other end of these things so I'm all for the quality being improved.' Charles was presented with a high-definition Sony camera to take home with him. 'Maybe I'll have to send the home movies back here to be mended,' he joked.","Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall on second day of tour .

"By . Rosie Taylor . Allergy: Hollie Davies is allergic to the cold - meaning she is banned from swimming, playing outside in cold weather and even eating ice cream . Winter weather for most of us means a bigger heating bill and having to wear more layers, but it could be deadly for one five-year-old girl. Hollie Davies, five, is allergic to the cold and breaks out into painful rashes within seconds of her skin meeting fresh air. A sudden drop in temperature could send her into a potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. It means the schoolgirl is banned from swimming, playing outside in cold weather and even eating ice cream. Her family have spent a fortune on heating and head-to-toe skiwear to keep her insulated against the chill. Her mother Nicola, 31, said: ‘It’s heart-breaking. She’s not allowed out to go and play with her friends. I try my best to explain her condition but it’s not easy. We’re desperate for the weather outside to cheer up so she can feel normal again. ‘When I tell other people that Hollie can’t get too cold, they tend to laugh at me. They think I’m either joking or being a paranoid parent - but actually it is a matter of life and death. ‘Her condition is so severe that if she doesn’t take her medication, she could go into anaphylactic shock and that is always a fear in the back of my mind. ‘We have to watch her every move. It’s horrible, for six months a year she is basically housebound.’ Hollie suffers from cold urticaria, which is thought to affect around one in 100,000 people. The condition causes itchy, painful hives which can last for days, shortness of breath and fatigue. Severe attacks can cause sufferers to collapse, go into shock or die. It usually begins in young adults and there is no known cure, although some patients grow out of it.Hollie began breaking out in angry rashes and welts whenever she was outside from the age of two. 'Heart-breaking': The young girl suffers from cold urticaria, thought to affect around one in 100,000 people . Her concerned mother took her to their GP who said it was an allergic reaction but could not figure out what was causing it. ‘I . was at my wits’ end,’ said Mrs Davies. ‘I had changed washing power, . stopped her eating nuts and exotic fruits, kept her away from any pets . and gave her only organic food. But still she was suffering from hives . every day.’ Cold urticaria is thought to affect around one in 100,000 people. he . condition causes itchy, painful hives which can last for days, . shortness of breath and fatigue. Severe attacks can cause sufferers to . collapse, go into shock or die. It usually begins in young adults and there is no known cure, although some patients grow out of it. Hollie was . eventually diagnosed after visits to Birmingham Children’s Hospital, but . doctors told her mother and father Darren, 38, there was no cure and . they could only try keeping her warm and on antihistamines to ward off . reactions. Mrs Davies said: ‘I thought that getting a diagnosis would be a weight off my mind but doctors knew so little that I still felt completely in the dark. ‘I was told I just had to make sure she was kept warm. I had no idea what we were going to do. 'It was the middle of winter and temperatures were below freezing.’ Now Hollie takes antihistamines twice a day, which means she can tolerate temperatures above 4C (39F) for a few minutes. Without medication she cannot withstand air colder than 15C (59F). From October to April her parents keep the heating on continuously in the family home in Tamworth, Staffordshire, and Hollie has to wear a ski suit and balaclava when outside to keep her skin covered. Painful: The allergy causes Hollie to break out into rashes (right) within seconds of her skin meeting fresh air . Even summer is no respite, as air-conditioning or being near the chiller section in a supermarket can trigger an allergic reaction. But Hollie remains a happy little girl, although she sometimes gets jealous of her elder brother Reece, seven, being able to play outside and go swimming. Mrs Davies added: ‘She knows what will happen if she does any of these things and she just accepts it, she’s a bubbly little girl and tries to look on the bright side all the time.’ Diagnosis: The schoolgirl was diagnosed with cold urticaria after visiting Birmingham Children's Hospital .","Hollie Davies diagnosed with cold urticaria at Birmingham Children's Hospital .

Alexis Stanton, 38, from Linden in Beacon Lough, Gateshead was left in agony with a bleeding scalp and says she was left with no choice but to shave her all hair off. Northumbria Police and Gateshead Council's trading standards officer John Herron is now investigating the incident involving a mobile beautician. Scroll down for video . Alexis Stanton was left in agony with a bleeding scalp after she had her hair extensions fitted with superglue . She was in so much pain she decided to shave the extensions off and has been left with bald spots . Alexis said: 'I'm gobsmacked this has happened and I really wouldn't want this to happen to anybody else. 'I'm still in pain in my head. It's damaged my scalp. I've cried so much since it happened I don't think I've got any more tears left.' She said she asked a mobile beautician who had previously done spray tans for her to fit the extensions believing that she knew what she was doing. Halfway through the session - which was done in Alexis' kitchen - she said her scalp became really sore and by the evening the pain was unbearable. Alexis, who says she was left with no choice but to shave her head, pictured before her extensions . She said she was told the new hair would 'slacken off' and the pain would ease the next day but 24 hours later she was still suffering. It was only after a trip to a local hairdressers to get them removed was Alexis told they had in fact been fitted with super glue. 'You're meant to use keratin based glue which should dissolve under acetone,' said Alexis, who is mother to Elana, three, and Kalan, five. 'I'd had the hair plaited in and then the glue placed on top. It was really tight to my head to the point I was in tears. The hairdresser asked me to ring the person who had put them in, who told me it was superglue. 'It was so painful I ended up going to A&E and the doctors gave me steroid cream for my scalp. Immediately I knew there was something wrong. It's still red raw now.' Alexis decided to get the extensions as a 38th birthday present to herself and said she bought fibre hair from a website recommended by the beautician. Northumbria Police is now investigating the incident and is carrying out enquiries to establish what happened. The . beautician who fitted them claimed in a text message sent to the . Newcastle Chronicle, who originally reported the incident, that she is . not a hairdresser and that Alexis knew that. She also said that the incident had been 'grossly exaggerated'. 'I'd had the hair plaited in and then the glue placed on top. It was really tight to my head' A beautician who had previously done spray tans for her fitted Alexis's extensions .

Julie Tompkins, 44, a hairdresser at Brens Hair Beauty and Tanning, said in 14 years experience she had never seen hair extensions fitted with glue. She said: 'Alexis came in last Tuesday and asked me to take them out and I just said it couldn't have been keratin-based glue because acetone normally breaks it down and it wouldn't. 'You would never, ever use superglue. She has been left with bald spots and was in so much pain she decided to shave them off. 'My advice would always be to use an experienced salon.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . For many, retirement is a chance to slow down. But those who want a healthy old age might be better off doing the opposite. Pensioners who walk more and at a faster pace lower their risk of a heart attack, a study shows. Rather than having a sedentary lifestyle in retirement, researchers found those aged over 65 who maintain or even boost their physical activity can improve their heart’s well-being. Pensioners who walk more and at a faster pace lower their risk of a heart attack, a study shows . A study of 985 adults with an average age 71 found that those who did the most exercise had an 11 per cent lower risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death than those who did the least. Dr Luisa Soares-Miranda, of the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, said: ‘Any physical activity is better than none, but maintaining or increasing your activity has added heart benefits as you age. ‘Our results also suggest that these certain beneficial changes that occur may be reduced when physical activity is reduced.’ Scientists calculated that the difference between the highest and lowest levels of physical activity would translate into an estimated 11 per cent lower risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. Over five years researchers took heart monitor recordings and found that people who walked more and faster and had more physically active leisure time had fewer irregular heart rhythms and greater heart rate variability than those who were less active. A study of 985 adults with an average age 71 found that those who did the most exercise had an 11 per cent lower risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death than those who did the least . Heart rate variability is differences in the time between one heartbeat and the next during everyday life. Dr Luisa Soares-Miranda, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, said: 'These small differences are influenced by the health of the heart and the nervous system that regulates the heart. 'Early abnormalities in this system are picked up by changes in heart rate variability, and these changes predict the risk of future heart attacks and death.' The researchers evaluated 24-hour heart monitor recordings of 985 adults with an average age 71 participating in the community-based Cardiovascular Health Study, a large study of heart disease risk factors in people 65 and older. The findings, published in the journal Circulation, found the more physical activity people engaged in, the better their heart rate variability. Participants who increased their walking distance or pace during the five years also had better heart rate variability than those who reduced how much or how fast they walked.","Pensioners who walk more and at faster pace lower risk of heart attack .

"By . Emma Innes . A motorcyclist involved in an accident shocked doctors when his heart rotated in his chest. The 48-year-old Italian man was rushed to a hospital’s emergency department after being . involved in the crash. Upon his arrival, doctors tried to listen to his heart. Doctors in Italy were amazed when a motorbike crash caused a man's heart to rotate 90 degrees to the right. X-ray (left) shows the heart after it had rotated and (right) shows it back in its normal position 24 hours later . It was then they discovered it was in an unusual place, Live Science reports. They X-rayed the man’s chest and carried out a CT scan which revealed that his heart had rotated 90 degrees to the right and was sitting on the right side of his chest. They also noted his aorta and pulmonary artery had rotated to the right. The man had also suffered numerous broken ribs, a collapsed lung, bruising to both lungs and a ruptured spleen, according to a report on the case in the New England Journal of Medicine. However, despite this, he was conscious and the only signs of his heart problems were a slight drop in his blood pressure and a slight increase in his heart rate. Dr Gregory . Fontana, chairman of the department of cardiothoracic surgery at Lenox . Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in this patient’s . case, explained his theory to Live Science. He believes the heart turned in the minutes after the crash. He said it is extremely unusual and even . more surprising that the patient was alert and conscious - despite such . a significant injury. The 48-year-old man's major vessels also rotated after the crash. Image (left) shows them after the rotation and (right) once they had returned to their normal position . He suggested damage to the motorcyclist’s lungs may have meant that air seeped into his chest cavity. If air had built up in his chest, this could have forced the heart to turn to the right. Amazingly, the man survived the horrific injury and his heart returned to its normal position the next day, report doctors from the University of Padua, Italy. Once the air was removed for the patient’s chest, his heart returned to its normal position. Amazingly, further tests showed the man's heart had suffered no lasting damage – none of the blood vessels had torn and the valves were functioning normally. The patient did, however, have to have emergency surgery to remove his spleen. The Italian patient is not the first to have a bizarre heart condition reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. Last year, the journal reported the case . of a woman whose serious heart condition was diagnosed after her heart . started pulsating violently. Last year the New England Journal of Medicine ran a report on the case of a Canadian woman whose serious heart condition was diagnosed after her neck (pictured) started to pulsate violently . The 33-year-old Canadian woman’s abnormal pulse alerted doctors to the fact she had a condition caused by a faulty heart valve. She was diagnosed with the heart condition tricuspid regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation is a condition which occurs when the heart's tricuspid valve does not close properly, meaning blood can flow backwards into the right upper heart chamber when the right lower heart chamber contracts. The valve separates the right lower heart chamber from the right upper heart chamber. When it is faulty the pressure in the blood vessels can change. This can lead to the abnormal pulses seen in the Canadian patient’s neck.","The 48-year-old in Italy was rushed to hospital after the crash .

"By . Jenny Hope . Sugary drinks should be labelled with health warnings to make them as socially unacceptable as cigarettes because of their contribution to Britain’s obesity epidemic, says a leading public health doctor. Professor Simon Capewell of the University of Liverpool caused controversy earlier this year by declaring ‘sugar is the new tobacco’ and claiming the food industry was focused on ‘profit not health’. Now he is calling on the Government to follow the example of California which is considering placing warning labels on all sweetened drinks about the links to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. Professor Simon Capewell warns the Government's current policies are doing nothing to quash obesity . He said current policies are failing to reverse the obesity epidemic in which sugar is ‘increasingly implicated as a specific causal factor’. And he highlighted a recent European study showing adults who drank more than one can of sugary fizzy drinks a day had a 22 per cent higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than those who drank less than a can a month. In a personal view published on bmj.com (must credit as stated), Prof Capewell said a third of children and two-thirds of adults are now overweight or obese in the UK. Halving US and UK children’s sugar-sweetened beverage consumption could mean a 50 to 100 kcal reduction in energy intake a day, perhaps arresting or even reversing the current increases in obesity, he said. He said surveys showed 60 per cent of Britons would support warnings on food packaging, which may herald a ‘tipping point in public attitudes and political feasibilities.’ The Government’s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies warned in March that the Government may soon have to slap a sugar tax on junk food and fizzy drinks to tackle obesity. Professor Capewell is part of a new US-UK campaign group - Action on Sugar - that says asking firms to make voluntary changes has failed. He caused controversy in January by declaring: ‘Sugar is the new tobacco’. The typical Briton consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and some adults consume as many as 46. The maximum intake recommended by the World Health Organisation is ten, although this guideline is likely to be halved. Health officials in California are considering warning labels for soft drinks like those on cigarette packets . Prof Capewell sugar was being ‘progressively demonised’. ‘Many other potentially harmful products already carry effective health warnings. For example, insecticides and other toxic products have long carried labels warning users to take extreme care’ he said. ‘Similarly, cigarettes have gone from being socially acceptable to quite unacceptable after warning labels were implemented. ‘The effectiveness of tobacco warnings and plain packaging is now accepted by almost everyone not linked to the industry’ he said. Prof Capewell said warning labels represented an ‘interesting natural experiment’ that ‘may offer an effective new strategy to complement existing, potentially powerful interventions like marketing bans and sugary drinks duties’. Prof Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine, BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Glasgow, said there was mounting evidence for sugary drinks contributing to excess energy intake, obesity and, in turn, higher diabetes risks. ‘Furthermore, as Prof Capewell points out, public support for an obesity warning on these drinks appears strong’ he added. Dr Nita Forouhi, MRC Programme Leader and Public Health Physician at MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, said ‘Big problems need bold solutions. If the California Bill, currently being considered for health warning labels on sugary drinks, goes ahead, it will set an important precedent. ‘There is a consistent body of evidence for the adverse health effects of sugary drinks.’ However, Professor Tom Sanders, Head of Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences Division, School of Medicine, King’s College London, said ‘Excessive intake of sugary drinks contributes to unhealthy weight gain in children. ‘But sugar is not like tobacco: it is not addictive and does not cause cardiovascular disease and cancer. ‘Oral rehydration solutions, which contain sugar, have prevented millions of deaths. ‘The risks to young people’s health presented by smoking, alcohol, drugs, unsafe sex, tattooing and body piercing are far greater – a warning label on soft drinks suggests a lack of perspective.’ California is considering a law that would require all cans and bottles of sugary beverages to have this warning label: 'Drinking beverages with added sugars contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.' It could be voted on by the state senate next week.","Professor Simon Capewell urges Government to follow California .

"By . Sophie Borland . The appalling diets of the nation’s teenagers have been exposed by a report which shows that many are already putting themselves at risk of diabetes, obesity and heart disease. And last night health experts warned that fruit juice – seen by many as a healthy option – should be drunk no more than once a day because of its high sugar content. Girls and boys aged 11 to 19 typically eat 42 per cent too much sugar and 14 per cent too much saturated fat. Health experts have warned people to stick to one glass of fruit juice a day due to its high sugar content . Health experts have warned that young people . aged 11 to 19 are consuming, on average, 47 per cent too much sugar, . with the main sources being fruit juice, soft drinks, cereal bars, . biscuits and cakes . Only 10 per cent of teenage boys and 7 per cent of teenage girls manage to get their five portions of fruit and veg a day. Adults do not fare a great deal better. Only a third get their five-a-day and the diet of the average adult exceeds recommended sugar limits by 10 per cent. The report, the Government’s National Diet and Nutrition Survey, also shows  that children aged ten and under typically exceed the recommended daily limit of sugar by 34 per cent. Their main sources of sugar are fruit juice, soft drinks, cereal bars, biscuits and cakes. It reveals that adults are eating half the recommended weekly amount of oily fish – which protects against heart disease, cancer and dementia – while teenagers and children only manage a fifth of  this amount. The survey, which involved 4,000 adults and children between 2008 and 2012, says 48 per cent of men and women have above-normal levels of cholesterol, putting them at higher risk of heart disease  and strokes. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘This study paints a clear picture that too many people, especially children, are not eating healthily enough. ‘This puts them at greater risk of . coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity now or in the . future. There is no magic bullet to solve this problem. Parents, . schools, restaurants, retailers and the food industry all have a role to . play. ‘But the Government can fire the first shot by implementing a 9pm watershed ban on junk food marketing to stop children being bombarded with advertising about products high in fats, salts and sugars. We also need stringent regulation to protect children from online marketing tactics.’ Only a third of adults get their recommended five-a-day, and are still eating too much fat, with 48 per cent having higher-than-average cholesterol, putting them at risk of heart attacks and strokes . Experts have also warned that government Change4Life adverts which promote healthy eating are not working, as people who already eat healthily are the only ones who pay attention . There is also concern that policies . such as the NHS’s Change4Life programme are having little effect because . only healthy adults and children pay any attention. The . initiative, which has cost taxpayers £65million since its launch in . January 2009, consists of television adverts, a website, a helpline and . locally-run sports clubs all aimed at curbing the obesity epidemic. The . scheme also produces posters for schools, community clubs, GP surgeries . and hospitals urging the public to eat their five- a-day, take regular . exercise and  cut portion sizes. Dr . Ian Campbell, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘In spite of a raft . of measures designed to encourage us to eat a healthier diet we are, as a . nation, failing miserably. ‘If we really care about the health of our children we need to take far more decisive action. ‘We need to regulate the food industry to make healthy choices easier, more attractive and cheaper.’ Dr Alison Tedstone, the chief nutritionist at Public Health England, the Government agency that released the report, said fruit juice was a good option as one of the recommended five fruit portions a day. But she warned: ‘It should only be drunk once a day and with  a meal because it can be high  in sugar.’ In March, Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer, said the Government may have to introduce a  sugar tax to help make the nation’s diet more healthy. Later that month the World Health Organisation urged the public to cut their sugar intake by half to six teaspoons a day. Yesterday Labour MP Keith Vaz called for food labels to include the numbers of teaspoons of sugar in all products.","Fruit juice should be limited as it contains a lot of sugar, experts warn .

"By . Binky Felstead . Greetings from NYC! I'm based in the Big Apple for the next few weeks as we film Made In Chelsea in America. I'm having the best time - loving the shopping and socialising. And hard at work, of course! Being over here has given me the opportunity to check out American make-up habits, and I have to tell you, these US girls really know their grooming. While we Brits favour a slightly slap-dash approach to beauty, our American sisters look sleek and glossy every single day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky has been inspired to up her beauty game by her polished state-side sisters . So I've decided to up my game. No more sleeping in my make-up, no more spilled powder or lipgloss leaking at the bottom of my handbag. It's time for a new, efficient regime, starting with my make-up tools. It's crazy that, while I'll often spend big on fabulous cosmetics, I've been using the same moth-eaten make-up brushes for years. Well, not any more. Investing in good quality applicators will make a world of difference to your make-up - allowing you to achieve a more professional-looking (and beautiful) finish. It's a no-brainer, really. After all, an artist wouldn't paint a masterpiece with his fingers - so why paint your face with anything but the finest tools? Binky's Best Beauty Brushes . Real Techniques Core Collection . This handy kit contains a pointed foundation brush, tiny precision brush for eyes and lips, contouring brush and fluffy buffing brush, encased in a handy portable case. The quality of these brushes are incredible for the price - my favourite has to be the buffing brush, which I use to apply liquid foundation when I'm looking for a medium-to-full coverage finish. It blends product out seamlessly for a flawless, HD-perfect base. Michael Kors Bronzing Powder Brush . This is my new must-have, as it allows for the expert application of my fave product - bronzer (as well as regular face powder). It has a soft, wide head, perfect for buffing and blending powder make-up. It's also soft enough to use anywhere on your body, which means you can use it to contour make-up on the delicate skin of your décolletage and neck. bareMinerals Double Ended Precision Eye Brush . This is a fabulous all-in-one tool for eyes. Use the ultra-soft contour brush to sweep and blend eyeshadow across your lids without tugging at the delicate skin around your eyes. Then flip it over and, with the stiffer, pointed liner brush (used either wet or dry), create the perfect precision eyeliner flick. Dior Backstage Large Eyeshadow Brush . Regular readers will know I'm a big fan of strong brows and smoky eyes, which means a brush like this one absolutely essential. The soft, angled head allows for precision application of eyeshadow and brow make-up, allowing you to place colour exactly where you want it. The result? Perfectly defined eyes. Binky is loving Bioderma's matifying fluid - she says it works well as a sun protector and primer . EcoTools Skin Perfecting Brush . This is a clever little brush and the secret is its angled edge. The shape allows you to get make-up right into hard-to-manage areas, such as the corners of your nose and eyes. Not only that, but the cut of this brush is specially designed for use with BB and CC creams, allowing for a super-smooth application and, since you're not using your fingers, ensuring less oil is transferred from your hands to your face. Clever! bareMinerals Maximum Coverage Face Brush . This full, firm foundation brush has bristles made from Taklon - a clever substance which picks up and dispenses more product than a regular hair brush. Use it to apply a really professional-looking base - you'll be so amazed at how flawless your skin looks, you'll never go back to finger painting! bareMinerals Flawless Application Face Brush . A great all-rounder, this brush works a dream with foundation, mineral powders, blushers and face powders. Chunky enough to pick up plenty of product and soft enough to blend beautifully, it's a multi-tasking treat! Real Techniques Your Finish/Perfected Blush Brush . Blusher and bronzer can be two of the hardest products to apply. Get it wrong, and you end up with clown-like blotches of pink on your cheeks or muddy streaks of bronze, and yet beautifully applied cheek colour really lifts your complexion, adding a warm, healthy glow. That's why this brush is such a find. The hand-cut, domed head gives you complete control, allowing you to deposit colour exactly where you need it, while its fluffy Taklon bristles ensure make-up is dispersed gently, without caking. I couldn't be happier with my new brushes, thanks to which I'm starting to feel as glamorously groomed as my NY buddies. You'll find a great selection of tools at my favourite online beauty store Escentual.com. I also have to give a shout out to one of my recent favourite products - the Bioderma Photoderm AKN Mattifying Fluid. With the temperatures rising here in NYC, I've been using this as both a facial sun protector and a primer. As well as protecting my skin from UVA and UVB rays, this SPF30 cream also regulates sebum production - keeping spots and blemishes at bay - and mattifies the skin. Finally, Skinbreeze Blemish Fix is another skincare saviour that's been helping me keep my complexion clear while in NYC.

"By . Jenny Hope . Walking just a quarter of a mile a day could save ageing adults from potential disabilities in old age . A 20-minute walk in the park every day could keep older people active and stave off disability, say researchers. The first study of its kind shows daily walking for about a quarter of a mile may mean the difference between staying mobile or becoming housebound. It found moderate physical activity helped ageing adults keep their ability to walk at a rate 18 per cent higher than older adults who did not exercise. The US-based LIFE study from Yale School of Medicine, coordinated at the University of Florida, also showed regular walkers were a quarter less likely to become permanently disabled. Researchers presented the results yesterday at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in Orlando and it was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. They recruited 1,635 sedentary men and women ages 70 to 89 for the study. The volunteers could walk a quarter mile within 15 minutes but were at risk of losing that ability. The participants were randomly separated into two groups and followed for more than two years. The first group walked 150 minutes per week and did strength, flexibility and balance training, and were regularly monitored. The second group attended health education classes and performed stretching exercises. Staff assessed participants every six months, checking their ability to walk, their body weight, blood pressure and pulse rate, among other measurements. They were not told who was assigned to physical activity or to the education classes. Researchers showed that prescribed daily physical activity can prevent older adults’ loss of mobility, defined in the study as the ability to walk 400 meters, or about a quarter of a mile. Co-principal investigator Jack Guralnik, professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the distance was an important figure for older adults. He said: ‘Four hundred metres is once around the track, or from the parking lot to the store, or two or three blocks around your neighbourhood. ‘It’s an important distance in maintaining an independent life.’ The study by Yale School of Medicine found a daily walk could prevent people from being housebound . Moderate activity helped volunteers maintain their ability to walk at a rate 18 per cent higher than older adults who did not exercise and there was a 28 per cent reduction in people permanently losing the ability to walk easily. Prof Guralnik said ‘The fact that we had an even bigger impact on persistent disability is very good. ‘It implies that a greater percentage of the adults who had physical activity intervention recovered when they did develop mobility disability.’ Wendy Kohrt, professor of medicine in the division of geriatric medicine at the University of Colorado, who helped review the scientific merit of the study, said ‘There is a general belief among the public and the scientific and medical communities that we know exercise is good for you, so why do we need to do more research in this area? ‘However, we still do not know whether certain types or doses of exercise are better than others, particularly for specific health conditions or diseases. ‘The LIFE trial demonstrated that a modest increase in physical activity has the potential to help older adults maintain functional independence.’","Yale School of Medicine found walkers quarter less likely to be disabled .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Travellers to exotic places should use repellents containing DEET to protect against insect bites - as the benefits outweigh the risks, say experts. British experts are backing the insecticide despite safety concerns. They say more harm occurs when people use too little DEET and put themselves at greater risk of potentially harmful diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Experts believe that travellers to exotic locations should use insect repellent containing DEET as the benefits outweigh any potential side effects (picture posed by model) Latest figures suggest the number of visits by Britons to tropical countries went up by two million between 2002 and 2012 – from 4.02m to 6.03m. Previous research has questioned the safety of DEET, which contains N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide and was developed by the US army for jungle warfare just after World War II. It is the active ingredient in many commercial topical repellents sold today. However, some governments limit its concentration after reports of a type of brain disease called encephalopathy following DEET use. Dr James Logan, senior lecturer in medical entomology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, recommends using repellents containing 20-50 per cent DEET in tropical countries. He said ‘If DEET products are restricted to just 15 per cent, it is likely that millions of people will be put at greater risk of mosquito bites which will dramatically increase their likelihood of developing a disease like malaria or dengue as a result. ‘There is plenty of evidence to show that low levels of DEET are not very effective, so it is important that travellers have access to repellents with greater levels of DEET that will provide the best protection.’ Dr James Logan said people should use repellents containing between 20-50 per cent DEET to counter the threat of mosquito bites . A new review of existing studies headed by Dr Logan concludes there is insufficient evidence to show that DEET is unsafe for human use. The review, published in the open access journal Parasites and Vectors (must credit), found the benefits of avoiding disease-spreading insect bites outweigh any risks associated with applying DEET to the skin. It discovered only one existing human trial on the safety of DEET, in pregnant women in Thailand. This study compared women who used a DEET-based repellent to prevent malaria transmission to a control group. There was evidence of traces of DEET in the children, suggesting that the substance could cross the placental barrier, but, crucially, no differences in the health of the babies between the DEET treatment group and the control group babies. The review also looked at existing animal studies to assess the safest amount of DEET to use in repellents and found that insufficient evidence had been gained from these to justify any imposed limits on concentration of DEET. Based on this, the authors weigh the safety risks found in trials against the protection that DEET-based repellents give against transmission of diseases. Dr Logan said the best protection against insect-borne illness was to avoid getting bitten, but repellent played an important part in reducing the burden of illness. He said ‘Our review article found very few studies that suggested any adverse effect of DEET. ‘In fact, there were only 14 cases of encephalopathy associated with DEET since 1957 which is extremely small considering the estimated 200 million applications of DEET to the skin each year. ‘If DEET caused serious health problems, we would know about it by now.’ A spokeswoman for the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said dengue fever -  a viral infection that is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes - is present in Brazil where football fans from around the world are due to converge for the world cup. It can cause life-threatening illness and there is there is no cure and no vaccine against it. The main protection against dengue fever is insect repellents, she said. ‘Biting arthropods can transmit a whole range of diseases to humans and it is vital to protect ourselves’ added Dr Logan. ‘Vaccines and treatments are available for some diseases, but not all, and so the best way to keep as safe as possible is to use an insect repellent containing DEET and reapply it regularly. ‘We want people to enjoy their holidays and tropical trips - we don’t want them ruined by illness so we want to do all we can to help inform and educate people about the facts rather than the many myths surrounding this issue’ he said.","Travellers to exotic locations should use spray containing at least 20 per cent DEET .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . Coffees made with camel milk have gone on sale at a UK coffee shop for the first time today. Leading coffee house Taylor Street Baristas is selling the camel milk coffees at its store in Bank, central London and they will also be served at its Brighton store on Saturday. Customers were asked to make a suggested donation of £1 above the standard price of the coffee and all the money raised will go towards the agricultural development charity Farm Africa. Camel milk, which has a 'clean and palatable' taste similar to semi-skimmed cow's milk, is rich in fatty acids and has around half the fat of cow's milk as well as up to three times the amount of vitamin C. It is also rich in unsaturated fatty acids. Camelattes, anyone? The Taylor Street Barista coffee shop chain is to start stocking camel milk drinks in support of developmental charity Farm Africa . The idea was dreamed up by Richard Ford, deputy fresh foods editor at trade magazine The Grocer who is raising funds for Farm Africa by running the Brighton Half Marathon on 16 February. Camel milk It is used in coffees sold throughout the UAE and has been imported into the EU by Emirates Industry for Camel Milk & Products since July last year under the brand name Camelicious. A number of stalls at farmers markets have sold coffees using camel milk, but this is thought to be the first time a major supplier has sold camel milk drinks. UK first? Farmers markets have been known to sell camel milk drinks, but it is thought to be the first time  mainstream coffee shop has supplied coffees using camel milk . Pioneers: The coffee shop is the first chain in the UK to start selling camel milk, which is a popular choice in the Middle East and parts of Africa . Richard Ford said: 'When I first approached Camelicious about my fundraising project for Farm Africa, ordering a 'camelatte' in my favourite coffee shop seemed like a dream. 'Cow, goat and even buffalo milk are all widely available in the UK now and there is no reason why camel milk cannot make it into the mainstream here too.' EICMP deputy general manager and business development manager Mutasher Al Badry said his organisation hoped to build a strong camel milk industry in the UAE and encourage other camel farming areas to do the same. 'Camel milk has always been known in the Middle East, as well as Eastern Africa, but the accessibility for the wider public has always been limited.' Healthy: Camel milk is a nutritious alternative to cow's milk . Camel milk, which is said to be closer to human milk than any other milk, has a number of health benefits for those who choose to drink it. It is rich is vitamins and minerals, especially vitamins B and C, and iron. The drink also has antibacterial and antiviral properties. Further, the milk is a rich source of insulin, making it a great treatment option for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes sufferers. According to the Camel Milk Association, a month-long study showed that people with Type 1 diabetes who drank almost a pint daily improved their blood glucose levels.Camel milk is also a good source of protein, and can often even be drunk by people with lactose intolerance.Currently, it may not be the most popular milk in the world, but it does offer benefits that cow and goat milks do not - including lower cholesterol levels.Traditionally popular in the Middle East, the milk has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium in recent years where it is generally sold in organic shops.","Taylor Street Baristas will be first UK coffee shop chain to sell camel milk .

"By . Moira Petty . Geoff says light was incredibly bright, and bits of the world were 'missing' Earlier . this year, the acclaimed British author Geoff Dyer fulfilled his . ambition of moving to Los Angeles for the 'wonderful' weather and . outdoors lifestyle. He and his wife Rebecca quickly fell into a . routine of coffee and almond croissants at a local cafe at 8am; she'd . then go off to work (as chief curator of the online  gallery, Saatchi . Art) and he'd go home  to write. Every other afternoon, he'd cycle to . the tennis courts at Venice Beach as the sun set over the Pacific. Two . weeks after they'd moved to LA, Geoff was getting ready to head out . with Rebecca when he remembered he had to put out the rubbish. Within . seconds, he found himself in the middle of a medical emergency that . might easily have cut this idyllic existence brutally short. 'I bent . down to put the rubbish in the bin, but when I stood up again, half the . world - everything to the left-hand side of me - had disappeared. 'Initially, . I thought I'd lost the sight in my left eye, but I soon realised it was . more complicated. I could see the frame of the mirror, but my face . wasn't reflected in it, as though I was a vampire. 'Rebecca came out . of the bedroom and I could see her up to chest level, but from there . upwards she was missing; no shoulders, no head.' Although this was . 'disorienting and disturbing', Geoff wasn't unduly worried. He was fit, . slim and a non-smoker; he'd no reason to suspect anything serious. Rebecca . called the hospital's ophthalmology department and made an appointment . for 9.30am. With an hour to wait, they decided to keep to their routine . and go to the cafe first. Geoff, however, found himself scrabbling . around to gather his belongings. 'I was incredibly confused,' he . recalls. 'I kept saying “Where are my keys?” and Rebecca would tell me . that I was holding them. 'On the five-minute walk, I had to cling on . to Rebecca. The light was incredibly bright, and bits of the world were . still “missing”.' At the hospital, an eye test established that the . problem was not his eyes but his brain. 'The doctor said the options . were a migraine or a stroke - and as I'd never had migraines, I feared . it had to be a stroke.' A neurologist did tests, then sent him for . an MRI scan. Within an hour, the neurologist delivered the bad news: . Geoff had had an ischaemic stroke - caused by a blood clot in the back . of the right half of his brain. 'My heart sank,' says Geoff. 'Two hours . earlier, the world had been fine. Now I felt a series of trap doors was . opening up beneath me. I thought: “Oh no, it's my brain. My whole . writing life comes from there.”' Geoff, 55, is the author of 14 . books, and in 2011, his collection of essays, Otherwise Known As The . Human Condition, won America's National Book Critics Circle Award for . Criticism. A neurologist did tests, then sent him for an MRI scan. Within an hour, they delivered the bad news . In many ways, his stroke didn't make sense. He cycles six . miles a day, plays tennis and table tennis, and his diet is healthy. 'I . hate all the food you're meant to avoid, such as fried, fatty foods, but . I do have a fondness for pastries.' He doesn't smoke and drinks only . moderately. Nor was there any family history of strokes. 'Of all my contemporaries, I'd have thought I was least at risk from a stroke,' he says. Strokes affect 150,000 a year in England, and are the third most common cause of death. 'The . majority of sufferers are over 75, and it is linked to factors such as . furred-up arteries and high blood pressure,' explains Dr Richard Perry, . consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and . Neurosurgery in London. 'However, one-quarter of all sufferers are . under 65. In younger patients, most strokes are caused by a clot which . has formed in the heart or blood vessels and then travelled to the . brain.' After his initial diagnosis, Geoff stayed in hospital . overnight for more tests. His eyesight was steadily improving, and by . 9pm he 'could just about see to type'. His wife brought in his laptop . and he began reading up about strokes. One of the things he learned . was that strokes can often be preceded by mini strokes, or TIAs . (transient ischaemic attacks), which can last anything from a few . seconds to 24 hours. These are regarded as warnings that a major stroke . is on the way. Number of people who have a mini stroke and then have a full stroke within a year . Geoff now realised that he had suffered several of these episodes over the previous two years. 'Several times, but for less than a minute each time, my vision went all weirdly sparkly and was incredibly bright. 'And . once, in spring of last year, my thumb and index finger went totally . numb for a few minutes. It was startling enough for me to comment on it . to Rebecca. But then it passed - and I forgot all about it.' In . fact, anyone experiencing a sudden onset of neurological symptoms such . as numbness or weakness in the limbs, drooping of facial muscles, speech . problems or loss of vision, should be  checked out immediately at . A&E, says Dr Perry. He says national guidance now is that such . patients should then be seen by a stroke specialist within a day if they . are deemed to be at high risk of a further stroke, within seven days if . they are low risk. This approach was introduced following a 2007 . study by the Radcliffe Infirmary at Oxford that 'sent shock waves' through the specialism, said Dr Perry. 'By seeing TIA patients . immediately and with aggressive management with statins (they asked . patients to take the first dose in front of them!), the medical . researchers were able to prevent 80 per cent of strokes that would have . happened when the patient wouldn't have seen a specialist for several . weeks. 'It's also very cost-effective. You don't have to prevent . many strokes before you start to reduce the massive expense of . disability.' By noon next day, Geoff was relieved to find more of his left side vision had returned. The . signs of a mini stroke or TIA (trans ischaemic attack) are similar to . those of full-blown stroke but they tend to last just a few minutes. If you suspect you've experienced one, it's vital to be checked by a doctor as soon as possible. Signs to watch out for are: . 'The . neurologist said they didn't know whether the blockage had cleared or . whether the brain, with its great ability to re-route stuff, had just . got round the blockage, but it all seemed pretty good.' He was . discharged with low-dose aspirin to prevent another clot and a statin to . be taken daily (20 mgs Lipitor) for cholesterol-lowering as a . precaution. 'The next day, the neurologist rang to say my cholesterol results were through the roof, and the statin dose was doubled.' The . precise cause of his stroke was never established but Geoff was one of . the lucky ones. While a third of stroke sufferers recover fully, . one-third die and a third are left with a physical disability. 'It was incredibly lucky to have had such a mild one,' he says. After three months, his statin dose was halved as his cholesterol levels were down to a respectable 4.25. Today, he has 98 per cent of his vision back. But Geoff admits that it's only recently that he's stopped feeling vulnerable. 'I . worried that a bigger stroke might be on the way.' His stroke, he says, . has highlighted 'how very precarious this thing of good health is'. Geoff's latest book, Another Great Day at Sea: Life Aboard The USS George H.W. Bush, is published by Visual Editions, £25.","Acclaimed British author Geoff Dyer, 55, suffered an ischaemic stroke .

"Childhood obesity is fueling an asthma epidemic, experts have warned. Previous studies have suggested expanding waistlines could boost childhood asthma cases. But scientists at Bristol University have now linked obesity to an increased risk of the respiratory disease. A study found the relative risk of asthma increased by 55 per cent for every extra unit of body mass index (BMI). A study by scientists at Bristol University has linked childhood obesity with rising asthma cases. File picture . The incidence of asthma - a chronic condition caused by inflammation of the airways - has been rising steadily over the past few decades, with more than 1.1 million children in the UK currently battling the disease. Leading charity Asthma UK today welcomed the study. Dr Samantha Walker, the charity's director of research and policy said: 'This research shows that children with a high BMI are more likely to develop asthma and is in line with previous research linking obesity with asthma. 'Asthma in children is a complex condition, and more research is needed to find ways to prevent asthma attacks and tragic asthma deaths. 'Keeping your BMI within normal limits brings all sorts of health benefits and may help reduce the risk of children developing asthma.' Latest figures show 18.9 per cent of children in Year 6 aged 10 to 11 were obese and a further 14.4 per cent were overweight. Of the children in Reception aged four to five, latest figures suggest 9.3 per cent were obese and another 13.0 per cent were overweight. In total almost a third of 10 to 11-year-olds and more than a fifth of four to five-year-olds were overweight or obese. Although the underlying causes of asthma are not known some experts think obesity may be one of the causes. Previous research had suggested a link between obesity and asthma but the new study published in PLOS Medicine used both genetic information and observational data in order to assess whether BMI has a causal effect on asthma. The study found the relative risk of asthma increased by 55 per cent for every extra unit of body mass index (BMI). File picture . The study looked at 4,835 children with asthma by the age of seven-and-a-half enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. A weighted genetic score based on 32 independent BMI-related DNA sequence variations was calculated, and associations with BMI, fat mass, lean mass, and asthma were estimated. The research found that the genetic score was strongly associated with BMI, fat mass, and lean mass, and with childhood asthma, and that the relative risk of asthma increased by 55 per cent for every extra unit of BMI. These findings suggest that a higher BMI increases the risk of asthma in mid-childhood, and that public health interventions designed to reduce obesity may also help to limit the global rise in asthma. There was also some evidence that body composition - lean body mass - influences asthma through pathways not related to obesity-induced inflammation. Dr Raquel Granell said: 'Environmental influences on the development of asthma in childhood have been extensively investigated in epidemiological studies, but few of these provide strong evidence for causality. 'Higher BMI in mid-childhood could help explain some of the increase in asthma risk toward the end of the 20th century, although the continued rise in obesity but with a slowing in the rise in asthma prevalence in some countries implies that other non-BMI-related factors are also likely to be important.'","Scientists at Bristol University have linked obesity to risk of asthma .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Adults can reverse the negative effects of heart disease by dropping unhealthy habits in their 30s and 40s, scientists claim. A new study suggests that eating a healthier diet and doing more exercise can control and potentially even reverse the natural progression of coronary artery disease. But the researchers warned that picking up extra bad habits as you get older will have a detrimental impact on your arteries. A new study suggests that if people make healthy changes to their lifestyle in their 30s and 40s, they can control and potentially even reverse the natural progression of coronary artery disease (illustrated) ‘It’s not . too late,’ said Bonnie Spring, lead investigator of the study and a . professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg . School of Medicine in Chicago. ‘You’re . not doomed if you’ve hit young adulthood and acquired some bad habits. You can still make a change and it will have a benefit for your heart.’ However, . according to the study, which was published in the journal Circulation, . if people drop healthy habits or pick up more bad habits as they age, . there is measurable, detrimental impact on their coronary arteries. Coronary heart disease kills around 82,000 people in the UK each year. About one in five men and one in eight women die from the disease. There are an estimated 2.7million people living with the condition. As well as angina - chest pain - the main symptoms of heart disease are heart attacks and heart failure. Coronary heart disease describes what happens when the heart's blood supply is blocked by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries. Over time, the walls of the arteries become 'furred up,' in a process called atherosclerosis. This can be caused by smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. ‘If you don’t keep up a healthy lifestyle, you’ll see the evidence in terms of your risk of heart disease,’ Professor Spring said. Scientists based their research on 5,000 participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, which examined people’s lifestyle behaviours as well as coronary artery calcification and thickening between the ages of 18 and 30 – and 20 years later. The healthy . lifestyle factors assessed were: not being overweight or obese, being a . non-smoker, being physically active and eating healthily without . drinking much alcohol. At . the beginning of the study when the participants were young adults, . less than 10 per cent of people reported all five healthy lifestyle . behaviours. At the 20-year mark, around one quarter of the participants . had added at least one healthy lifestyle behaviour. Increasing healthy lifestyle factors were . linked with reduced odds of detectable coronary artery calcification . and lower intima-media thickness, which are two major markers of . cardiovascular disease that can predict future cardiovascular events. ‘This finding is important because it helps to debunk two myths held by some health care professionals,’ said Professor Spring. ‘The . first is that it’s nearly impossible to change patients’ behaviours. Yet, we found that 25 per cent of adults made healthy lifestyle changes . on their own. Professor Bonnie Spring said: 'You're not doomed if you've hit young adulthood and acquired some bad habits. You can still make a change and it will have a benefit for your heart' ‘The second . myth is that the damage has already been done - adulthood is too late . for healthy lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of developing coronary . artery disease. 'Clearly, that’s incorrect. 'Adulthood is not too late for healthy behaviour changes to help the heart.’ While . some participants in the study became healthier in their lifestyle . choices, 40 per cent of the sample dropped healthy habits and acquired . more bad habits as they aged. ‘That loss of healthy habits had a measurable negative impact on their coronary arteries,’ Professor Spring said. Increasing healthy lifestyle factors were linked with reduced odds of detectable coronary artery calcification and lower intima-media thickness, which are two major markers of cardiovascular disease that can predict future cardiovascular events. An illustration of a thickened and hardened artery is pictured . ‘Each decrease in healthy lifestyle factors led to greater odds of detectable coronary artery calcification and higher intima-media thickness. 'Adulthood isn’t a “safe period” when one can abandon healthy habits without doing damage to the heart. 'A healthy lifestyle requires upkeep to be maintained.' Professor Spring said the healthy changes people in the study made are attainable and sustainable. She thinks that people can maintain a good lifestyle by not smoking, keeping a healthy body weight, doing 30 minutes of moderate exercise five times a week and eating a healthy diet that is high in fibre and low in salt, with lots of fruit and vegetables. She said that women should limit themselves to one alcoholic drink a day and men, a maximum of two drinks.","Researchers at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago based their findings on a study of 5,000 people .

"By . Ben Spencer . The benefits of statins outweigh the risk of side effects, a group of health experts claim . Overwhelming evidence now shows that the benefits of statins vastly outweigh the risk of side effects, a group of health experts has claimed. Six professors from British universities yesterday entered the growing debate about the use of statins, the UK’s most prescribed drug. Many GPs and patients are concerned about their over-prescription, which some say will needlessly expose people to side effects such as muscle pain and diabetes. But the group of leading cardiologists and epidemiologists dismissed fears about side effects as misrepresentative and misleading. Professor George Davey Smith, clinical epidemiologist at Bristol University, said ‘the jury is no longer out’ on statins. He said: ‘Trials have shown unequivocally that statins reduce coronary heart disease mortality and there are very low levels of severe side effects. ‘We are not forcing these tablets down people’s throats, we are giving people the evidence on which to make a decision.’ Professor Davey Smith added that a great root of the misunderstanding is that people on statins tend to blame the drug for any minor health problem. He said: ‘Because people have symptoms they look for an explanation and their doctors look  for an explanation, and they attribute it to the tablet.’ Their intervention comes just a fortnight before the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is due to publish new guidelines that will radically increase the use of the drug. The medication is currently only available to those at a 20 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade. Some seven million Britons already take the drug. The new guidance will advise GPs to prescribe statins to anyone deemed to have a 10 per cent risk, which is estimated to increase the number on statins by up to ten million. The planned shift to ‘pre-emptive’ prescribing has led some GPs to warn that many people will be given the drugs who do not need them. Dr Kailash Chand, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Statins are very useful for people at high risk, those who have had a stroke or heart attack. New guidance advises GPs to prescribe statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk, leading some GPs to warn that people who don't need the drug might be given it . ‘But to prescribe these drugs to those at low risk prompts a real concern we are over-medicalising and over-statinising Britain. ‘Statins definitely have side effects – that is what I have seen after 30 years of prescribing them as a GP. To say otherwise is just not true.’ But Oxford University professor Sir Rory Collins said trials have definitively shown that taking statins over five years increases the risk of side effects by less than 1 per cent. He added: ‘It isn’t irrelevant to have a heart attack, it is a major life-changing event. ‘For many people a stroke is a life-changing event. To avoid these is important. ‘If one looks at the absolute risk, which is less than 1 per cent, and you look at the absolute benefit, the benefits in those terms outweigh the risk.’","Six professors from British universities have dismissed fears about statins .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists have shown for the first time that the parents of children with autism (pictured) are more likely to have autistic traits too . Scientists have shown for the first time that the parents of children with autism are more likely to have autistic traits. Such traits could be an adult just being a little bit too repetitive or more focused on details than usual. Previous studies have shown the siblings of . children with autism tend to have more autistic traits than those . related to children who are not autistic. ‘When there was a child with autism in the family, both parents more often scored in the top 20 per cent of the adult population on a survey we use to measure the presence of autistic traits,’ said John Constantino, professor of psychiatry and paediatrics at Washington University in St. Louis. ‘It could be that a mother or a father is just a little bit repetitive or slightly over focused on details. ‘We can measure the presence of those traits with our questionnaire, but higher scores don’t mean a parent has problems. 'In fact, there may be advantages to having some of those traits. ‘The problem comes when those traits are so intense that they begin to impair a person’s ability to function.’ He explained that too large a ‘helping’ of particular traits can have a negative influence on a child’s behaviour and social skill and that traits related to autism tend to be natural variations in social skills. For the study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, researchers analysed data from 256 children with diagnoses of autism and almost 1,400 children who did not have the disorder. Data from more than 1,200 mothers and 1,600 fathers of the children was also examined. All of the subjects were part of the Nurses’ Health Study II, which has been gathering health information from more than 116,000 nurses since 1989. Scientists have shown that the parents of children with autism are more likely to have autistic traits too- and these could simply be a very high attention to details (illustrated) for example. When there was a child with autism in the family, both parents more often scored in the top 20 per cent of the adult population on used to measure the presence of autistic traits . Nearly half of the siblings of autistic children develop abnormally, according to a study published last month. Scientists discovered 17 per cent go on to develop autism themselves and a further 28 per cent show delays in their development or behaviour. But these signs can be detected at a year old, meaning the children can get help as early as possible. Among the 28 per cent of children who showed developmental delays, differences were identified in their social, communication, cognitive or motor development by 12 months. The most common deficits were in social communication and caused problems such as extreme shyness with unfamiliar people, lower levels of eye contact and delayed pointing. Sally Ozonoff, lead author and professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the UC Davis MIND Institute in California, said: ‘Having a child in the family with autism spectrum disorder means that subsequent infants born into that family should be regularly screened for developmental and behavioural problems by their paediatricians. Together with colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health, the scientists used the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) to measure the presence of autistic traits. People who score less than 59 on the SRS are considered normal. When both parents had mild elevations in SRS scores, the study indicated that they were 85 per cent more likely than parents without elevated scores to have a child with a form of autism. If only one parent’s SRS score was high, the likelihood of having a child on the autistic spectrum increased by 53 per cent. Even among non-autistic children, elevated parent scores correlated with higher SRS scores in their children. Professor Constantino said: ‘It turns out that people tend to select one another on the basis of many of the same traits that the SRS measures. 'Likes attract. If one person has a high score, he or she is more likely to partner with another person who also scores high.’ Such a partnership is likely to raise the chances that their offspring will have elevated SRS scores. ‘When both parents have scores at or above the top 20 per cent, the child’s score is 20 to 30 points higher than when neither parent has an elevated SRS score,’ he said.","Traits can include adults showing a little too much repetition .

"A father-of-three died months after being given the all-clear from the cancer a doctor misdiagnosed when he first fell ill. Mark Browne from Lincoln was told by his GP that he was 'too young' to be suffering from bowel cancer, and was diagnosed with piles. Mr Browne's widow and three children this week agreed an undisclosed settlement at the High Court in Nottingham, two years after his death, following an admission of liability by Mr Browne's GP. Father-of-three, Mark Browne (pictured) died months after being given the all-clear from the cancer doctors misdiagnosed when he first fell ill. He was told by a doctor that he was 'too young' to be suffering from bowel cancer and his symptoms were misdiagnosed as piles . The Lincolnshire Echo reported Dr Smith admitted care failures after he wrongly diagnosed Mr Browne as suffering from piles rather than cancer. When Dr Nicholas Smith of Birchwood Medical Practice in Lincoln carried out an internal examination on Mr Browne, he failed to detect the then 3cm tumour. Mr Browne, who was over the age of 40, had been complaining of stomach pains and passing blood, but was not referred to the hospital. A year later, doctors discovered a 6cm cancerous tumour, starting Mr Browne on a . course of treatment. The Browne family 's lawyer said if Mark’s cancer had not been missed the first time he may still be alive today. Neil Clayton, from law firm Lime, who . represented Mark Browne, said: 'Had Dr Smith correctly referred Mark in . December of 2008 he would have been operated on in February 2009 and . thus likely avoided the return of the tumour which was at the root of . his painful and distressing symptoms and the immediate cause of his . death. 'He also would not have developed cancer in his lungs and he would have likely survived.' His wife Teresa, 38, said: 'As far as Mark was concerned there was nothing to worry about. A year after misdiagnosing Mr Browne's condition, doctors discovered a 6cm cancerous tumour, starting him on a course of treatment. He was later given the all-clear after a course of chemotherapy and an operation - but afterwards was told that the cancer had spread to his lungs. He is pictured here with his children . Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in England. It is a general term for caner that begins in the large bowel. Symptoms include passing blood and unexplained changes in bowel habits, such as prolonged diarrhoea or constipation, as well as weight loss. Approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases develop in people aged 65 or older. Bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy. If bowel cancer is diagnosed in its earliest stages, the chance of surviving a further five years is 90 per cent, and a complete cure is usually possible. However, bowel cancer diagnosed in its most advanced stage only has a five-year survival rate of 6 per cent and a complete cure is unlikely. 'He was very black and white and if the doctors told him he was fine, then he was fine - he took it as gospel. 'Mark was given some suppositories to treat the piles and that was it. 'Mark was a man’s man and very proud. I really had to push him to go to the doctors in the first place. 'It wasn’t really a normal thing we would talk about.' But 12 months later Mr Browne was still passing blood, prompting his wife to insist he returned to the doctors. In September 2009 he visited a different doctor, who performed a rectal examination immediately making an urgent two-week referral. MRI scans revealed Mr Browne had a 6cm cancerous tumour. Mrs Browne said: 'We were angry it hadn’t been spotted before but Mark took everything in his stride and was very matter-of-fact about it.' Her husband underwent a colostomy, before starting a long course of radiation chemotherapy - the aim to shrink Mr Browne’s tumour before performing keyhole surgery to remove it. Mr Browne's wife, Teresa, who is pictured here with their children, said: 'In hindsight he and I wished he'd got a second opinion or questioned the doctor again when things didn't clear up. My advice to anyone is to insist on a second opinion or second examination' Mrs Browne said: 'Mark was very strong and brave. He continued to provide for his family throughout his illness. 'In hindsight he and I wished he’d got a second opinion or questioned the doctor again when things didn’t clear up. 'My advice to anyone is to insist on a second opinion or second examination - even if you think you are being a nuisance - rather than risk what happened to Mark. 'Doctors are only human - they’re not 100 per cent infallible - and sometimes get things wrong. 'I still grieve for my husband and it’s very painful for me to talk about what happened. 'However, I made a promise to Mark before he died that I would speak out because awareness of his case might help save the life of just one person by getting them to have a check up or ask for a second opinion.' After treatment and further surgery to remove the tumour and part of Mr Browne’s rectum in February 2010, the father-of-three endured more chemotherapy. The Browne’s then attended an appointment at Lincoln County Hospital in October 2010, where they were told by a nurse that Mr Browne's results were back and were all clear. Mrs Browne said: 'The nurse told us Mark’s results were all clear and we were overjoyed. 'We thought Mark had beaten the disease and we began to piece our lives back together. 'We thought he’d been cured.' The family enjoyed Christmas together as Mr Browne concentrated on building his strength. After five happy months, he attended another follow up appointment with his oncologist in March 2011. Mrs Browne said: 'Our illusion was shattered when Mark’s oncologist told us in that the cancer wasn’t gone had spread to his lungs. We were told it was not treatable. 'It was a tragic blow, which we hoped we would never have to experience. Mr Browne's tragic situation is reminiscent of the recent death of Midlands teen Stephen Sutton (pictured), who recently passed away after a four-year battle against the disease . 'It was devastating to find out the . cancer wasn’t gone and had spread, after spending the previous months . getting our lives back and looking to the future.' Mr Browne continued to work as a road planner but as his condition deteriorated his wife gave up her job as a sales assistant, to care for her husband of 18 years. In August, Mr Browne's condition worsened and after five weeks in hospital he was allowed home for his final days. He slipped into a coma on August 7, 2012 and died in his sleep in Mrs Browne's arms two days later, aged 46. Mr . Browne's tragic situation is reminiscent of the recent death of . Midland’s teen Stephen Sutton, who recently passed away after a . four-year battle against the disease. Manjit Darby, Director of Nursing and Quality at NHS England, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire said:  'NHS England, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire is committed to ensuring that patients receive the best possible primary care services.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A toddler born with a rare joint condition is able to walk for the first time after wearing 'concrete trousers'. Harrison Hobson had to wear an unusual double leg cast to fix a condition that caused one of his hips to be permanently dislocated. For the first six months of his life, the baby’s legs had to be kept in an awkward shape in a harness, before being encased in the ‘concrete trousers’. Harrison Hobson, had to wear the unusual double leg cast (pictured left) to cure his dysplasia - a condition that caused his hip to be permanently dislocated. After two operations and a long recovery, he can now run around (pictured right) like any other toddler . Doctors noticed a problem with Harrison’s hips just before his mother Charlotte Hobson, 33, was due to take him home from hospital after his birth . Medics diagnosed the newborn with dysplasia, after his hip joint failed to form properly around the top of his leg, causing his right hip to constantly dislocate. At just four days old, Harrison was placed in a full body harness that locked his hip into a fixed position. For nine out of ten dysplasis cases this is enough to solve the problem, but when Harrison’s hip failed to heal, doctors decided to operate placing his legs in a plaster cast at five weeks old. The procedure was found to have failed a week after it was performed and Harrison had a second more invasive operation and a new cast fitted. For three and a half months, Mrs Hobson had to deal with the challenge of trying to change, dress and bathe a baby stuck in the unusual cast. Doctors noticed the problem with Harrison’s hips shortly after his birth. At just four days old, he was placed in a full body harness that kept his hip locked into position, before being fitted with the cast (pictured left) He has now made a full recovery (right) Mrs Hobson (pictured with husband Jason) was at first apprehensive as to whether she and her husband Jason would be able to hold their baby with his new cast, but they were given advise from dysplasia charity Steps about how to care for their son while he was in his plaster cast . The new mother was at first apprehensive, worrying whether she and her husband Jason would be able to hold their baby with his new cast. They were advised by dysplasia charity Steps, that they should not pick him up from under his arm pits because the cast was too heavy and instead were taught a new method of carrying their son around. After Harrison’s cast came off, Mrs Hobson was worried he would take longer than other children to reach the milestones of standing and walking. But at 14 months old, Harrison took his first steps and now aged two, he is running around like any other boisterous toddler. Mrs Hobson, from Bristol, said: ‘It was such an unusual cast and it doesn’t look comfortable at all so it was heart-breaking to know that my son had to be stuck like that for so long. ‘It’s not a natural position and as a mum you just don’t want your baby to be in pain. ‘The harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle. Mrs Hobson said: 'The harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle. Then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers (pictured). They were so big and bulky and I was worried people would laugh at him' ‘And then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers. They were so big and bulky and I was worried people would laugh at him.’ She said her son's diagnosis came as a shock after reading ‘every single parenting book’ when she was pregnant, finding no warning about hip dysplasia. At first, doctors thought both her son's hips had fallen victim to the condition, before concluding it was just Harrison's right hip was affected. ‘Just before we were due to go home from the hospital, a doctor wiggled his hips around and told me that they were both dislocated,' she said. At 14 months old, Harrison took his first steps and now aged two, he is running around like any other boisterous toddler . ‘My husband Jason is a professional rugby . player and has seen a fair few injuries in his time so I thought it . would be just a case of clicking them back in. ‘But then they explained to me about hip dysplasia - it was a horrible sinking feeling. You could feel his hip click in and out.’ Mrs Hobson said that it was hard to imagine the cast before it was on her baby. ‘I just had all these questions about whether he was going to be in pain, whether I’d be able to keep him clean and tidy. Would I even be able to find him clothes big enough to fit over the cast? ‘But with all the help from Steps we managed to deal with the “concrete trousers” situation and people were only sympathetic when we explained what was wrong. ‘Once he finally got out of his cast it was such a feeling of relief. Now you’d never know that he’d ever had a problem.’ Tim McLachlan, CEO of Steps said: ‘Steps receives calls from parents across the UK who are upset at being asked by strangers “how did you manage to break both their legs?” referring to their toddler who is in a hip spica cast from waist to ankles. ‘Hip dysplasia is a common condition, but not common knowledge and we need to change this. ‘Developmental dysplasia of the hip affects one to three per cent of all births in the UK regardless of background - that’s up to 24,000 children per year or an entire class in an every average secondary school. ‘It’s more than the number of new diagnoses of leukaemia and skin cancer combined.’","Harrison Hobson had to wear an unusual double leg cast to fix his dysplasia .

"By . Tracey Cox . Are there ways to help you and your partner orgasm at the same time? The myth of the simultaneous orgasm is still clutching onto the bed sheets tenaciously - and judging by the amount of couples on telly still moaning 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' in unison, it's going to hang on there for some time yet. The reality is, you'd be hard pressed to find the same scene recreated in bedrooms at home because couples rarely climax together. Let's take a look at the facts. Roughly 75% of men in relationships always have an orgasm with their partner, compared to 30% of women. Men's orgasms last around 5-10 seconds (if he's lucky), women's orgasms can last 15 seconds or more (much more, if she's lucky and he's adept). Do the math and you'll soon see the chances of both of you orbiting into orgasmic ecstasy at exactly the same moment is highly unlikely. Romantic, yes. Likely, no. Quite frankly, taking turns - you have your orgasm first, he has his later - is not only more practical, it's sometimes a lot more satisfying. Having an orgasm is a selfish experience: you're totally and utterly fixated on your own pleasure. Having to pay attention to your partner's bits to guarantee they're enjoying themselves at exactly the same moment doesn't enhance the experience, it interferes with it . For men, this is less of a problem. Their orgasms are easier to trigger and once triggered, continue. Women's require a lot more attention and, unless tended from start to finish, can halt or merely trickle away halfway through. While he's twitching and moaning with orgasmic joy, we're often twitching and moaning with resentment at having been robbed at the last moment. Yes simultaneous orgasm can be an incredibly bonding moment but you're still better off making it a pleasant bonus rather than an aim. Women's require a lot more attention and, unless tended from start to finish, can halt or merely trickle away halfway through . 'The best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm is to make friends with her vibrator'","Simultaneous orgasms are, largely, a myth .
75% of men always have orgasms during sex, but only 30% of women do .
Taking turns is more practical, says leading sex expert Tracey Cox .
'The best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm is to make friends with her vibrator'
Get him to have an orgasm first and make the 'together' orgasm the second one. Most men find they have much better control second time around.
Ignore the old advice of getting him to think about big pants or count backwards. The aim is distraction but it simply doesn't work. New research shows even as he's manically saying '459, 458' in his brain, another part is saying 'What does he think I am, stupid? As if this is going to grab my attention when I've got a pair of breasts bobbling in front of me, my penis is nestled in a nice, warm, sexy place, my girlfriend's moaning and throwing her head back and….'
Use the bridge manoeuvre: This is the technique most sex therapists recommend. The basic idea is to give you clitoral stimulation up to the point of, but not actually to, orgasm and let his thrusting trigger off the orgastic reflex. This effectively provides a 'bridge' between clitoral stimulation and intercourse.
Choose the right position. Woman on top or him from behind are the most likely positions to stimulate the front vaginal wall and up your chances of a penetrative orgasm.
Talk lots, telling each other exactly where you're at by using a number system. Groaning out a 'Nine!' or delivering a curt 'Still two' might seem odd to start, but it's a quick and effective way to communicate in bed.
Switch stimulation regularly. Not only will it keep you both hovering rather than climbing steadily toward a climax, it stops sex becoming too orgasm focused. Change positions. Change rooms. Change the CD. Anything to change the mood, keeping it hot and sexy but maintaining a measure of control.
Make friends with her vibrator. If you asked me the best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm, this would be it. One of you holding a wand vibrator (slim, cylindrical, non-intrusive) over the clitoral area during penetrative sex is the most effective way to ensure a shared orgasm experience."
"By . Sarah Griffiths . The world's most expensive footballer has pulled a pair of pants over his £85million head to join a legion of celebrities backing a campaign to find a bone marrow donor for an eight-year-old-girl. Real Madrid star Gareth Bale smiled, white boxers on his head, in a bid to help a schoolgirl desperately in need of a life-changing transplant. Hollie Clark was diagnosed with the rare condition, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) two months ago, leaving her reliant on regular blood transfusions. To help find a suitable donor her family, who live in Cardiff, launched a social . media campaign calling on people to take a picture with their pants on . their head, posting the photo alongisde the hashtag #pantsonyourhead.

Hollie Clark, 8, (pictured with her uncle Matthew) has been diagnosed with a rare bone marrow syndrome. Her family has launched a social media campaign to help find Hollie a bone marrow donor . The campaign, started by Hollie's parents Laura and Stephen, pictured with Hollie and her brother Sam, was inspired by her uncle Matthew. He put his underwear on his head to make his niece laugh while she was in hospital prompting the idea to raise money for the Anthony Nolan Trust . Yesterday, Bale, 24, became the most famous face to join the search for a donor. A . host of stars, including Russell Howard, Welsh rugby player Sam .

The Welsh striker tweeted: ‘Hollie is in need of a bone marrow transplant, please RT! £pantsonyourhead @HelpHollie @HolliesParents.’ The campaign was launched earlier this . month by Hollie’s family and her mother, Laura, said there has been a . 2,580 per cent increase in the number of donors signing up in the weeks . since the appeal began. Hollie was diagnosed with MDS – a blood disorder which causes a drop in the number of healthy blood cells in the body - in April this year after developing unusual bruising. Her mother took her to their doctor who ran tests and sent Hollie straight to hospital, where she was diagnosed. 'It was an absolute shock, it is literally the worst thing as a parent you could be told,' said Mrs Clark, a GP. 'It was hard to believe because she’d been so active at the time - she loves swimming and cycling and playing with her friends, and she’d been doing all these things without us even knowing that her haemoglobin levels were dangerously low.' Hollie relies on regular blood transfusions until a suitable bone marrow donor can be found and it is hoped that the social media campaign will help find a suitable donor. Cyclist Geraint Thomas shows his support . Hollie's mother, Laura saidthere has been a . 2,580 per cent increase in the number of donors signing up in the weeks . since the appeal began. Rugby player Shane Williams (pictured left) and TV presenter Gethin Jones (right) have lent support to the campaign . The family came up with the idea for the #pantsonyourhead campaign while Hollie was in a hospital bed following her first treatment. ‘At the time the only way some of our family could communicate with her was by using FaceTime videos on their phones,’ Mrs Clark said. 'It has been absolutely amazing. We have not got a match yet, but right from the start we said it was about finding a match and raising awareness, and we have definitely done that' - Laura Clark, Hollie's mother . ‘Her uncle, Matthew put his underwear on his head to make her laugh while he was talking to her on FaceTime and it sparked an idea for a way we could raise awareness about Anthony Nolan in a way that's fun and personal to Hollie. ‘We are reaching out, and every single person in the public can help. 'If they are too old to donate bone marrow they can still donate blood. ‘It has been absolutely amazing. We . have not got a match yet, but right from the start we said it was about . finding a match and about raising awareness and we have definitely done . that. ‘We would love to personally thank everyone.’ Hollie was diagnosed with a rare bone marrow failure syndrome two months ago and needs a transplant. The social media campign to find her a donor is supported by Welsh sporting stars, including Sam Warburton - and his dog Ledley .

Hollie's family has asked people aged from 16 to and 30 to register with Anthony Nolan. Karen Archer, Regional Register Development Manager at Anthony Nolan said: ‘The “pants on your head selfie” idea has really taken off and is making a big difference in terms of the numbers joining the register. ‘The support of sportspeople like Gareth Bale and Sam Warburton is particularly invaluable in helping us reach young men - which is really important as they are most likely to be chosen to donate but only represent 14 per cent of the register.’ Readers can support the campaign by visiting www.helphollie.com or www.anthonynolan.org.","Hollie Clark, 8, has been diagnosed with .

"By . Andy Dolan . Updated: . 02:01 EST, 11 October 2011 . Feeling constantly tired and thirsty, and struggling with her weight, a worried Claire Ayton decided to seek help from her GP. Blood tests failed to uncover the cause of the problem and she decided, in desperation, to see a hypnotist. It was then that the unlikely cause of her health problems emerged – she was a Diet Coke addict. Mrs Ayton, a mother of two, failed to mention to her doctor that for ten years she had been drinking seven pints of Diet Coke a day – at a cost of up to £1,300 a year. Addiction: Claire Ayton eyes up two bottles of Diet Coke - the amount she used to drink every day . Revitalised: Claire Ayton is an ex Diet Coke addict after drinking seven pints a day for 10 years . Far from helping her lose weight, the 36-year-old actually put on three stone – leaving her weighing almost 13-and-a-half stone by this summer. It was only when she visited hypnotist Russell Hemmings, based in Coventry, for help losing weight that she was told she was a fizzy drink addict. After drinking around 7,300 bottles in a decade, she has been on a permanent Diet Coke break since August – and feeling revitalised. The teaching assistant, from Pailton, Warwickshire, said: ‘I didn’t think of it as an addiction. It was an everyday thing. I’d have one coffee in the morning and nothing else to drink but diet cola for the rest of the day. ‘I was always thirsty. People used to comment how many bottles of diet pop we bought at the supermarket or kept in the house. I just thought, “Well I drink it all”.’ She added: ‘When I told Russell how much diet pop I was drinking he was quite surprised and said I needed to cut it out of my diet to improve my health and drink more water. ‘I looked up the side effects of the artificial sweeteners on the internet. Allegedly aspartame is the worst. ‘It’s in lots of diet drinks. I was definitely suffering side effects.’ The ‘cold turkey’ was tough, she admitted. Artificially sweetened diet drinks may cause you to pile on the pounds rather than aid weight loss, say scientists. A study review by Professor Qing Yang at Yale University found aspartame and saccharin both increased the desire to eat more. The . June 2010 paper found that artificial sweeteners can active food reward . brain centres without fully satisfying the resulting cravings. So while the drinks themselves contain hardly any calories they may encourage consumers to reach for another treat afterwards. ‘I had headaches and on the third day I felt as though I had been beaten up,’ added Mrs Ayton. ‘But then I started to feel better. My head is clearer, not so fuzzy, and I have much more energy. I’ve lost 5lb so far. I’d like to lose two-and-a-half stone. Now I just drink water with a chunk of orange. And our monthly shop is cheaper – we could go on holiday somewhere nice and sunny for that.’ Mr Hemmings described this as  ‘the worst case of fizzy drink addiction I have ever treated’. ‘I’m so glad she’s kicked the habit,’ he said. ‘When Claire first came to see me she was very lethargic, had no motivation and was sitting on the settee eating junk food. ‘Now she is drinking two litres of water a day, doing exercise classes and her diet has improved. ‘A lot of overweight clients come in with diet drinks because they see it as a “no-calorie” sweet treat. Slim clients tend to drink water.’ In June, U.S. researchers confirmed artificial sweeteners and diet drinks cause weight gain, possibly by boosting a craving for sugary foods. Mrs Ayton is now on a permanent Diet Coke break after kicking the habit with the help of a hypnotherapist - although she suffered 'cold turkey' withdrawal symptoms .","Drank 14 two-litre bottles every week for ten years .

"By . Angela Epstein . Thanks to gym visits and an exercise regime that includes swimming and power walking, I pride myself on being a High Street size ten. But there’s one part of my body that refuses to slim down, that I have always been ashamed of: my thick, shapeless ankles. Not for me, calves elegantly slimming down to a tapered point just above the heel. Instead, I have a stubborn chunk of shapeless flesh, a fusion of calf and ankle known as the cankle. Some people are cursed with cankles because they are overweight or retain fluid there. In my case, it’s down to bad genes. I’ve tried everything I can think of to conceal them, from leggings to full-length skirts. But nothing seems practical. So I’ve adopted a uniform of ankle boots — clinging to a wintry look well into summer. Can I shake-up my wardrobe and camouflage the dreaded cankle?

"By . Jo Riley . Alex said he was 'pleased and proud' to get his Cambridge degree. He now plans to have a gap year . A brave music student battling a terminal disease has achieved his dream of graduating from Cambridge University today - after refusing to be treated in hospital during his finals. Music prodigy Alex Stobbs, 22, suffers from a virulent form of cystic fibrosis and became dangerously ill during his exams - even losing one-and-a-half stone. His lung capacity is just 38 per cent - a level at which doctors usually recommend a lung transplant - and he has to take 50 tablets a day and oxygen at night to survive. But against all the odds Alex managed to complete his music degree and has now graduated with an impressive 2:1. 'I’m very pleased and proud to have got my degree,' Alex said. 'It has been an extremely tiring and stressful five months and I’ve been in the library most days but I’ve had great support from my family and friends and it has paid off in the end. 'My health has been bad and I should have gone into hospital several times since January but I couldn’t justify taking the time out from studying. 'I knew if I went into hospital and even took just a week out I may not ever get my degree so I just ploughed on. 'It was really important to me that I got a degree I was happy with so I worked as hard as I could.' Alex, who comes from Kent, was due to take his finals at King’s College last May but his health deteriorated and he was finally forced to leave the prestigious university after four lengthy hospital stays. On one occasion his lung capacity went down to a critical 20 per cent and he had to spend three weeks in hospital. But after six months recuperating he managed to return to the university last October for his final year. Alex gets around campus on an electric scooter. He has brittle bone disease due to having to take steroids for years . 'By the end of term I would just look . forward to sleeping,' said Alex, whose chest has got increasingly worse . over the last few months. 'I was working hard and not eating as much as I should have been and I quickly lost a lot of weight and started to feel weak. 'I worked myself into the ground, but it was worth it.' Alex won a scholarship to Eton College when he was just 13. He excelled in music and moved millions when he starred in a Bafta-nominated documentary conducting Bach’s Magnificat at the college. But his health deteriorated and he almost died several times. Alex (pictured today left) hopes to become a conductor. He first came to public attention after featuring in a Channel 4 documentary called 'A Boy Called Alex' in 2007 (right) Years of steroids have left him with brittle bone disease and he has had to use a small electric scooter to travel around the university campus. Alex, who eventually hopes to become a conductor, is also becoming increasingly deaf because of the mucus build-up. Although his lungs are getting worse he is keen to avoid a lung transplant for as long as possible. Now he has graduated he will spend several weeks in hospital re-gaining his strength before taking a gap year. He plans to move to London and continue working on his composition of an opera set in a hospital, before possibly going to music college in the future. He has also set up a group featuring lots of sporty musicians who plan to play to raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. 'Lots of people are surprised I have got this far but I am very determined,' he said. 'I’m worried about my health but I’m happy that I’m doing everything that I want to with my life.'","Alex became dangerously ill studying for his exams losing one-and-a-half stone .

"By . Claire Bates . Updated: . 20:49 EST, 2 January 2012 . Arlynn Presser, 55, has met 292 of her online friends since last January after she made a New Year's resolution to overcome her fear of open spaces. The mother-of-two has battled the affliction her entire life but five years ago things got so bad that she stopped going out altogether.  When she was too afraid to go her own son's graduation she realised she had to confront her issues. Arlynn at the end of her year-long journey: She told her blog fans to 'think big' when it came to making resolutions . Arlynn said it would have been easy for her to stay indoors and only communicate online, but she wanted more from life . She said: 'It got to the point that I was so frustrated with myself that I knew I had to tackle this head on. 'I wanted to do something extreme and life-changing but I didn't know what. 'Then one night I was talking to a friend on Facebook who had recently broken up with his girlfriend. 'He felt so bad about it that what I wanted to see him and take him out for a beer. 'That's when I got the idea. Why not visit all my Facebook friends? We act like our cyber friends aren't real people but why not go and see them in person?' Arlynn has taken a whole year to complete the challenge which has taken her to 11 countries and set her back a whopping £30,000. Arlyn with Facebook friend 287 Brenda Allison from Ayettevill, Arkansas. Brenda says resolutions can be broken down into bite size chunks . New experiences: Arlynn enjoys travelling in a sidecar in Chicago in August . Speaking yesterday at her home in Chicago where she was spending time with sons Joseph, 23, and Eastman, 19, she said: 'I feel like I can do anything. I feel really amazing. 'There were obviously people who I couldn't get round to or weren't willing to take part but I saw about 90 per cent of my friends. 'The whole experience was terrifying but I've learned how to deal with my fear and that was the point. 'My new new year's resolution is to use what I've learned to help other people suffering from agoraphobia.' Met 292 of her 325 Facebook friends . Visited more than 51 different cities . Taken at least forty five . flights . Travelled to Mexico City, the north of Alaska and visited friends around the world including in India (pictured) and The Philippines . Brave Arlynn, 55, visited the majority of her friends in the USA at the beginning of the year but in October she set out to meet her international friends. With her son Joseph she flew to Korea, Taiwan, The Philippines, Mumbai, Rome Austria, Germany and finally the UK. She said: 'I would suffer from panic attacks on a daily basis but my son got me through it. 'I couldn't have done it without him. He was very good at just making me get up and go without thinking too much about what I was doing.' Arlynn has suffered with agoraphobia for the majority of her life and revealed how debilitating the condition could be. She said: 'I have always suffered from intense anxiety and panic attacks when I go into open spaces. 'I managed to control it to a certain extent but since my first son left home it got worse. 'As the agoraphobia became more intense the number of things that seemed possible got smaller while the number of things I couldn't do was infinite. 'I was constantly living in fear of a panic attack. 'I was frightened to go to restaurants or take my children for a family outing in case I had one. 'And when it did happen there was an overwhelming fear that I was going to die.' Overcoming fear: Arlynn with Janie Gibson, who she knows through her sons and is Facebook friend 22 . Facebook friends 187 and 188: Lane Wheeler and Sheila Kerrigan Wheeler, who took to the Renaissance Faire in Wisconsin . Arlynn will now return to her work as a romance novelist but says she will keep up with her Facebook friends online and in person. She said: 'If it's one thing this year has taught me it's that you need to keep track of your friends, because in the end your friends and your family are all you have.' Read more on Arlynn's blog here . One: If you feel a panic attack coming on and find you are breathing . rapidly, breathe slowly in and out of a brown paper bag or cupped . hands. Although you may feel you can't catch your breath, you are probably over . breathing and taking in too much oxygen - making you feel giddy. A . paper bag will help your oxygen levels return to normal. Two: Don't attempt to fight your way out of a panic attack - this will . simply increase the adrenaline. Instead accept the feelings will come . and go and allow the symptoms to play their tricks as they will. Practise imagining yourself floating over them. Eventually the panic . will subside - be patient with this. Three: Focus outside of yourself during an attack. Listen to some music . or do a pleasurable task while waiting for the panic to subside. Four: Firmly tell yourself that your symptoms are nothing more than an . over-sensitised nervous system that has gone into 'fight or flight' mode. They are temporary feelings and are not . medically harmful or dangerous. Five: Change your lifestyle. Take regular exercise - this helps to burn . off excessive adrenaline. Avoid cigarettes and alcohol. Eat regular . meals and avoid processed foods and drinks, to keep blood sugar levels . stable. Six: Don't bottle up your emotions. Find someone to confide in, such as a family member, friend or counsellor. Seven: Learn a relaxation technique. First close your eyes and breathe . slowly and deeply. Locate any areas of tension and imagine them . disappearing. Then, relax each part of the body, bit by bit, from the . feet upwards. Think of warmth and heaviness. After 20 minutes of doing . this, take some deep breaths and stretch. Eight: Reduce your exposure to unnecessary stress. Be prepared to express your needs to others and assert yourself.

"By . Ian Gallagher, Valerie Elliot And Claudia Joseph . One of the first signs that Operation Royal Baby is in full swing will be when an armed policeman appears on the steps outside the hospital. By that time Kate will be on her way and is expected to be taken into the Lindo through one of three side entrances. Meanwhile, obstetrician Marcus Setchell will be alerted on his specially-encrypted mobile phone by the Royal couple’s private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton. The couple have yet to pick a name for the royal baby, and have opted not to find out the sex before the birth . Assuming he is at his North London home at the time, Mr Setchell will grab his carefully prepared overnight bag and climb into his silver BMW. The six-and-a-half-mile journey to the hospital should take no more than 20 minutes. But in case of heavy traffic, he can always put the green flashing light he is entitled to use as a doctor on call on the roof of his car. In the early stages of labour, Kate is likely to have her mother Carole at her side. But sources are now indicating that Mrs Middleton will not be present during the delivery, as has been suggested. The Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital where the first child of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge is expected to be born . The Lindo wing boasts state-of-the-art clinical and emergency facilities . In common with other patients, the Duchess will give birth in one of the six delivery rooms on the Lindo’s third floor, which features ‘soothing’ block colour murals by London-based artist Julian Opie. Courtiers have spoken of a ‘range’ of  finely-tuned contingency plans, quietly confident that they have thought of everything. Yet one rather important matter remains unresolved. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that William and Kate have yet to choose a name for the future heir to the throne. The couple, who asked not to be told the gender, have drawn up a shortlist of boys and girls’ names – but, like many modern couples, will only make a final decision after the baby is born.","The Duke and Duchess do not yet have a name for the royal baby .

But, after making a loss of £71 million last year, its Monaco-tanned owner Sir Philip Green seems to have settled on an aggressive new strategy: copying M&S in every possible way. Scroll down for video . BHS are targeting Middle England mums. 'People don't want to buy cheap rubbish,' Sir Philip says bluntly. 'People want to buy nicer things. Premium value.' BHS is about to fight M&S by introducing 50 new food halls, a range of high-quality homeware in vamped-up shops and a new line of well-cut clothing designed for older women. In Sir Philip’s quest to capture mid-market woman, he has also been busy poaching a host of senior staff from M&S, including managing director Richard Price, womenswear trading director Sara Bradley and head of childrenswear buying Rachael Smith. Sir Philip is clearly moving in for the kill but, as he walks me through his souped-up collection at BHS’s Central London headquarters, he steadfastly refuses to be drawn into comparing BHS and M&S directly. Instead he talks about his new target customer: ‘a Middle England mum — a slightly older demographic’. Sounds familiar? ‘People don’t want to buy  cheap rubbish,’ he says bluntly.  ‘People want to buy nicer things. Premium value.’ Squint slightly and everything looks like it could have come from Marks — albeit for a fraction of the price — from a smart print jacket to a Roland Mouret-alike monochrome body-con illusion dress for £35. Then there’s the new BHS Food Stores. For the moment they’re stocking only basic groceries — no gourmet TV dinners likely to trouble the M&S food hall — but the swanky style of some of the posh nosh planned for the Christmas gifts section makes it clear that battlelines are being drawn. Homeware is also being taken very seriously. Sir Philip wants it to pass his acid test: ‘If you put it on a table, without a label, can you guess it’s from BHS?’ A candle in a glass jar catches his eye. ‘How much is that?’ he demands. ‘Ten pounds,’ a quivering subordinate splutters. ‘Exactly. That’s great! £10? That’s fabulous. I want my wife to see that. I’m taking that with me. That’s really good. That is excellent. £10? Bravo,’ he says, scooping it up. Lucky Mrs Green. But he’s not done with blowing the BHS trumpet: ‘Somebody well-known texted me last week and said: “I just happened to go into BHS and bought four fabulous lights and some fabulous home stuff.”’ Which of his celebrity friends could it have been? Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Hudson, Naomi Campbell, or perhaps Kate Moss? ‘Just someone you’d know,’ he says, with a nudge-wink smirk. So how do BHS’s offerings compare with those from M&S? The answers may surprise you… . All BHS branches had food halls for years, but they were closed in the late Eighties. Now Sir Philip is testing the waters with two BHS Food Stores in Staines and Warrington. Another will open in Romford in four weeks. So is there likely to be a BHS chicken tikka masala or cottage pie? So far, it seems not, with the Food Stores offering instead an affordable mix of branded goods — such as Pepsi at £1 for two litres and Bisto gravy granules at £1 for a 170g jar — as well as alcohol and fresh and frozen foods. The stores are punctuated by giant price signs and red stickers boldly announcing ‘£1’ or ‘85p’. It’s not very M&S, but Sir Philip says that customers are already going for a less ‘larder-stocking mix’ than expected — with fresh food doing well — so the potential for selling posher groceries is definitely there. And take a look at the Christmas gift items that will be in the main department store (yes, they’ve already been planned). There are £35 hampers, swanky chocolates and big, classy bottles of infused olive oil that are distinctly upmarket. This is BHS’s heartland, and the retailer has really gone for it, with everything from £15 duvet sets inspired by Prada and Carnaby Street to bravely quirky floor lamps for £130. The products are high-end and smartly grouped into design styles, including next season’s sophisticated ‘Greyscale’ look — all soft, luxurious textures in the proverbial 50 shades of grey, highlighted by expensive-looking metallic gleams. Christmas collections, too, will go far beyond baubles and tinsel, with stylish and quirky bedding, lighting and decorations that would look at home in Heal’s or Graham & Green. BHS' Alyssa Purple Flower dinner plate, £3, M&S' Summer Meadow dinner plate, £7.50 . With everything pulled together into room-sets styled up to look like Interiors magazine, BHS could be a real secret weapon in decorating the home. In contrast, M&S feels like a very cohesive collection but slightly bland — all very tasteful but not nearly as much fun. BHS has a strong vintage streak, while M&S is more contemporary but less vibrant. The  different takes on this year’s favourite owl cushions say it all — BHS has a funny little thing by quirky young label Sass & Belle, while M&S offers a more subtle cushion in shades of brown. Two plates tell the same tale: M&S’s pretty but crisp Spring Meadow dinner plate versus BHS’s painterly, confident Alyssa Purple Flower dinner plate. Prices, surprisingly, are almost on a par in many cases, although BHS is still erring towards the cheaper side. BHS' Floral Mardi  Gras bra, £16, M&S' Rosie for Autograph silk bra, £22.50 . M&S’s loyal customers love its lingerie with a passion — and it’ll be nigh on impossible to lure them away. In any case BHS’s current range simply does not reach the heights of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s satin drawers. However, it does have some pretty lace bras from just £12 — a price that is on a par  with M&S’s most basic bras — and many are made in the same factories as M&S’s, so the quality is up there, if not the variety. Most M&S shoes now feature the comfort-enhancing Insolia inner soles. But BHS has a rather stylish collection featuring foot-friendly details such as low block heels and low wedges. There are also a couple of good statement bags, although some do look cheap close up. But at around £20, they’re half the price of M&S’s. BHS' Wide-fit peep-toe  slingbacks, £15, M&S' Peep-toe Insolia slingbacks, £17.50 . The bread and butter of both Marks & Spencer and BHS’s clothing lines have long been easy-to-wear basics: T-shirts and blouses, comfortable trousers and classic office wear that won’t scare the horses. However, M&S has also spent years developing more high-profile brands — like the Limited Collection, Autograph, and love-it-or-loathe-it Per Una — that cover every base from beachwear to eveningwear. BHS is now taking the same path by renaming its classics range ‘Profile’. But instead of grouping clothes by brand, BHS is grouping them by category — T-shirts, occasionwear, shoes, and so on. This undoubtedly makes it easier to shop for specific items. After all, if you want to buy a cardigan, it makes sense to have all the cardigans in one place rather than scattered around the shop. BHS' Gold shift dress, £55, M&S' Pearl effect prom dress, £89 . For this spring/summer, the frumpy-but-functional BHS utility trousers are still selling in the hundreds of thousands — but many of its key pieces, such as smart dresses and jackets, are well-tailored, fashionable, tasteful and distinctive. A great deal of effort has been put into fabrics, too — historically one of M&S’s strengths. At BHS, Sara Bradley’s product knowledge seems to be shining through here, to the possible detriment of her former M&S bosses. The daywear includes some surprisingly sophisticated, well-cut wiggle and shift dresses, costing between £30 and £50 — slightly less than similar dresses in M&S’s standard ranges. BHS' Pocket crepe tunic dress,  £25, M&S' Zipped pocket shift dress, £39.50 . And there are plenty of sleeves (oh happy days), lower hemlines and generous cuts to please the less-than-coltishly slim. Knitwear is still basic, with some acrylic faux-cashmere jumpers that will have you crackling like an electric force field. However, there are pure cotton cardigans for £15 in a rainbow of shades that Sir Philip says he is proud of. But at the moment, BHS is still a long way from the breadth of M&S’s knit collections. When it comes to next autumn’s coats, BHS has a range starting at £45, from little-old-lady sensible to gently fashionable — a relatively conservative approach that may well appeal to those turned off by the styling extremes  of the M&S Best Of  British collection. Eveningwear has gone glam, too: there are well- tailored vintage-looking dresses with lots of lace and gold jacquard, impressive amounts of beading on the necklines and accessories to match. Skirt lengths are elegantly low and, as well as the younger looks, there are forgiving pieces that will hide middle-aged spread.","The fight to seduce Mrs Middle England is on as BHS and M&S begin battle .

"By . Marianne Power . Gwyneth swears by it, Jennifer Aniston can’t go a day without it and Beyonce wants to tell the world about its benefits. No, it’s not a new exercise regime or anti-ageing cream - it’s a vegetable. Kale, to be exact. Yes, this humble green leaf - a close relative of broccoli and brussels sprouts - is the latest must-have product for the A-list, who are baking it, juicing it, slicing it and even wearing kale-sloganed sweatsuits, and it looks like we’re all following suit. Marks & Spencer says sales of kale are already up a third on the same period last year, while at Waitrose they’re up 20 per cent. Meanwhile, kale is appearing on beauty shelves and a cookbook called Fifty Shades Of Kale has just been published. Scroll down for video . Marianne Power (pictured) tries the cult of kale . It’s cheap, too - with a supermarket bag costing just £1 - so I’m going to spend a week finding out why it’s now so cool. I will have kale for breakfast, lunch and dinner, use kale beauty potions and even wear accessories made of kale. The foundation of any kale-based diet is the smoothie. There are countless versions online but I follow recipes recommended by Gwyneth Paltrow on her website Goop, who promises an ‘invigorating way to start the day’. As well as being rich in magnesium (good for circulation, nerves and bones), fibre, iron and calcium, kale contains 17 times more vitamin C than carrots. No wonder it’s considered a superfood. A smoothie using the wonder-vegetable is the foundation of any good kale diet . Monday morning and I start with a recipe that involves adding five kale leaves, an apple, juice of one lemon, a handful of ginger shavings and three leaves of mint to a blender with either coconut water (Vita Coco, £1.99) or tap water and a dash of almond milk (Alpro, £1.69). You can use a blender (which retains the fibre) or a juicer (which blitzes the ingredients and removes bulk). However, Gwyneth loves the uber-expensive Vitamix blender, so that’s what I use, even if it costs £500. The high-powered blades are said to extract 100 per cent of  the nutrients from fruit and vegetables. I add the ingredients, blitz and two seconds later I have my Paltrow-patented smoothie, for the princely sum (minus the blender) of 75p. Although it looks like green gunge, it tastes fresh, clean and zingy. I think this might be the start of a whole new me, until lunch when I’m desperate for bread and cheese. Instead, I feast on kale salad. Again, there are hundreds of recipes online - ranging from kale with parmesan and walnuts to kale Caesar salad. I keep it basic: raw, chopped kale drizzled with oil, lemon and tuna. It’s all wrong - chewy, fishy and really unpleasant. I’m meeting friends in the evening, so make a very basic omelette with red peppers and steamed kale. But I fail to drain it sufficiently so I’m left with gloop not Goop! I add avocado to my smoothie to make it more filling, and swap the acidic lemon for lime. At roughly 200 calories, it feels much more like a meal and it’s tastier, too. Buoyed by my success, I decide to apply myself to lunch. That’s when I discover the secret art to making a kale salad. Because kale leaves are so fibrous, most recipes suggest marinating the leaves in olive oil, salt and lemon juice for at least 15 minutes before serving to allow the acid to break down the fibres. The secret art to making a kale salad is to marinate the leaves in olive oil, salt and lemon juice for at least 15 minutes . Alternatively, you can steam the kale lightly first, then rinse with cold water. The most important thing is that if you are buying whole leaves (as opposed to ready chopped) you have to remove the tough stalk in the middle. Confusingly, I also keep reading advice to ‘massage the kale’. Apparently, rubbing the leaves in both hands assists in breaking down the fibres, making it easier to eat. And so lunch is kale salad with pomegranate and feta. After marinating and massaging, it tastes much better and feels like a bit of a culinary triumph. For dinner, I blitz up kale and sweet potato soup in the Vitamix again. It’s a delight. I do have the odd sugar craving but kale is incredibly filling, however my stomach gurgles as my system adjusts to this much roughage. Now I am a kale connoisseur, I realise that no amount of stewing will ever make the stalks edible. So remove them and blanch the leaves for a minute in very salty water, then saute in butter, garlic and salt for another minute or so. 'Now I am a kale connoisseur, I realise that no amount of stewing will ever make the stalks edible' explains Marianne . The greens are soft, tasty but with just enough bite. I add sauteed bacon and a poached egg and serve up a satisfying lunch. In the evening, I do stir-fry kale with garlic, chilli and chicken. Also delicious. I can certainly feel my tummy is flatter and I’m sure  my skin is brighter. So obsessed have I become with the Vitamix that I am creating new smoothies every morning. Today, blueberries, banana, kale and almond milk. Rich and sweet, with the kale adding a salty tang. For lunch I make savoury muffins with kale, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and toasted pine nuts. They’re soft, slightly salty and gorgeous. Now my meals have become more robust, every mouthful requires what seems like minutes of chewing, which slows down my eating considerably. Although fiddly, kale crisps dipped in dark chocolate is delicious . Tonight, I have friends over and I whip up a batch of kale crisps, which you can also buy in Pret A Manger. Making your own is easy - simply remove the core of the kale and chop the leaves into quite  large chunks. Drizzle with olive oil and lots of salt (and chilli powder if you’d like) and bake at 175c for eight minutes. They are crispy, salty and delicious, with 80pc of your daily iron intake. I then see a recipe for chocolatey kale crisps, dipping the baked leaves into melted dark chocolate. It’s ridiculously fiddly - the leaves keep breaking - but the results are great, like a crunchy, salty chocolate. My first sugar fix of the week couldn’t have come fast enough. Another smoothie. By now I’m feeling very clean inside, a little too clean, truth be told. I feel like I’m going to the bathroom all the time. I don’t think this would be the most practical of diets in a busy office. My carb cravings are significantly curbed and lunch is more kale salad, with chickpeas and bacon, and dinner is pasta and pesto made with kale instead of basil. Pile parmesan, toasted pine nuts, olive oil, garlic and kale in a blender. Anything tastes good loaded with mountains of cheese and oil. Until the end of the Middle Ages, kale was one of the most common green vegetables in Europe . Such is the depth of the kale craze, that you can even add kale to your beauty regime. UK organic skincare range Nourish, have a kale eye-cream, hand cream and facemask. Kale is full of vitamin A, thought to reduce wrinkles and helps the skin repair itself, and vitamin K, which tackles dark circles. Revital Eyes Kale Biominetic Anti-Ageing Eye Cream (£29.95, beingcontent.com) promises to reduce redness and puffiness. To save money, I whip up my own facemask using an online recipe. I mix spinach, kale, olive oil and an ordinary face cream in a blender. I look - and smell - hideous but my skin does have an afterglow and any spots seem to have vanished. Forget kale dipped in chocolate, real kale lovers have it dipped in gold. While googling ‘kale fashion’ - as you do - I find a beautiful kale leaf necklace on Etsy.com for £40. Yes, a real kale leaf dipped in  14-carat gold by Gem and Metal Designs . Delicate and ever so slightly quirky, four people comment on it the first  day I wear it. Gimmicky, yes, but also pretty. Marianne even made kale ice cream by putting it in her Vitamix with coconut milk, lime juice, maple syrup, and ice and blitz before freezing . I . celebrate the end of the week with kale ice cream. I simply select . ‘freezing mode’ on the ever-talented Vitamix, add kale, coconut milk, . lime juice, maple syrup, and ice and blitz before freezing. It’s a bit . watery but perfectly pleasant. So . how was my week? Well, aside from severe kale fatigue, I was surprised . at how versatile it is, and it’s a bargain to bulk up a meal with fibre . and nutrients. What wasn’t a bargain was my Vitamix blender, but I have . fallen in love with it. At the end of the week I’d lost around 4lb; plus my jawline doesn’t just look clearer, but firmer, which I can only attribute to all the extra chewing I’ve had to do. I’m still making a kale smoothie every morning and I’ve swapped it for lettuce in my salads. Kale may be a fad - but who cares, when I feel so much better for it?","Marianne Power spent a week eating kale in different ways .

"Doctors told Allan Taylor, 78, in April that his cancer couldn't be treated and had spread from his colon to his small intestine . In August the retired oil rig engineer from Middlesbrough got another letter - to say he was cancer-free . He puts the change down to his new diet, which he adopted after looking up 'colon cancer cures' on the internet . By . Rob Preece . A grandfather, who was told by doctors that his cancer was 'incurable', has been given the all-clear less than four months later - after trying a different diet. Allan Taylor could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when doctors told him they could do nothing to treat his condition. But the 78-year-old would not give up, and instead searched the internet for an alternative method to fight his cancer. Given the all-clear: Allan Taylor, 78, beat cancer by changing his diet and taking herbal remedies . After studying websites, he decided to radically change his diet - and found his condition improved dramatically. Mr Taylor, a retired oil rig engineer from Middlesbrough, replaced red meat and dairy products with 10 portions of raw fruit and veg each day. His diet included powdered grass, curry spices, apricot seeds and selenium tablets. Mr Taylor made the changes after he received a letter on April 30, telling them were was no point having any more chemotherapy as it would not cure him and neither would an operation. 'They said if they cut out the cancer it would just pop up somewhere else,' he told the Sunday Mirror. 'But I was determined to stay positive and decided to find my own cure. 'I was determined to stay positive and decided to find my own cure' 'On August 6 I got a letter from North Tees hospital to say a scan had shown my cancer had gone and ""the abnormality is no longer visible"". I’m all clear.' Mr Taylor's ordeal began in February last year when he noticed a two-inch lump in his abdomen. He was sent for a scan and told he had colon cancer. Last September he underwent an . operation, during which a surgeon removed a nine-inch section of his . colon, and he began a three-month course of chemotherapy. But in April this year he was told the cancer had spread to small intestine. Mr Taylor responded by tapping the words 'colon cancer cures' into an internet search engine. He used the information, together with advice from his local health food store, to devise his new diet. He believes that having a teaspoon of powdered barley grass in hot water every morning and night was particularly crucial. 'There is no question in my mind that my diet saved my life,' he said. 'And all it cost was £30 a week.' Good news: Mr Taylor learned he had the all-clear in a letter sent from North Tees hospital .","Doctors told Allan Taylor, 78, in April that his cancer couldn't be treated and had spread from his colon to his small intestine .

"By . Martha De Lacey . Kate McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine was abducted in Portugal in 2007, has spoken about being the target of internet abuse for taking part in the Virgin London Marathon this Sunday. Speaking on ITV's Daybreak this morning, McCann, 45, who has been training to run in aid of the charity Missing People, an organisation which offers a lifeline of support when someone disappears, said she believes more needs to be done to tackle online trolls. Under a link on Facebook about McCann . doing the Marathon someone wrote: 'Well I am going to, Anyone got a Gun? BBBangggggg? (sic)'. Police are looking in to who made the threat. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kate McCann talking on Daybreak this morning, left, and her daughter Maddie, right, who went missing in Portugal in 2007 when she was three years old . She told Daybreak: 'We have obviously had a lot of abuse over the last six years, so in some ways it's nothing new. I think we tend to get a little bit blasé, which is wrong because you shouldn't do because it's bad.' McCann continued: 'It is internet abuse and we both feel really strongly that more should be done about internet abuse. People wouldn't get away with behaving like that in the street and yet they feel like they can hide behind a computer at home.' Kate, speaking on Daybreak this morning, said she and her husband Gerry feel strongly that something should be done to prevent people being targeted by internet abuse . McCann, who also has eight-year-old twins Amelie and Sean with her husband Gerry,  continued: 'We do have children. Even sometimes when I do think they're cowards and I'm not even going to go there, then I think about my children and I think it's not right that they should come across stuff like that as well.' Speaking to presenters Lorraine Kelly and John Stapleton, the mother-of-three revealed she plans to go ahead with the marathon, despite some recent knock-backs to her health. She explained: 'It's been quite a slog and I think anybody who attempts a marathon knows there's a lot of training involved. 'And it's gone well really until the last five weeks. I've got a couple of problems, I've had a recurrent Achilles tendon problems... and I’ve also got a problem with the joint in my left foot.'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A hospital has sparked outrage after banning overweight patients from using beds on an emergency ward. Those weighing over 15 stone are not permitted to use the beds at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, north east Scotland, after fire experts insisted the evacuation system was a danger for overweight patients. Campaigners have slammed the restriction . as 'completely unacceptable' and denying patients their rights - but . the hospital has insisted it must remain. The ban has been imposed by Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, Scotland, after fire experts insisted the evacuation system was a danger for overweight patients . Hospital bosses imposed the order after meeting with Grampian Fire and Rescue Service. Margaret Watt, chairperson of Scotland Patients' Association said: 'I've never heard anything like this before and it is totally unacceptable. 'The ban is actually against the patients' human rights and civil liberties and they can quite easily launch legal action if it means their treatment is hampered.' The section affected is the former ward 10, which was closed last . year for refurbishment but has re-opened as an Acute Medical Assessment . Unit. Ms Watt added: 'I understand the fire brigade's danger assessment, but I feel the hospital should have had a plan that catered for patients of all shapes and sizes before doing this work. 'We've known for a long time that many people are overweight, that's not happened overnight, so the hospital should be clever enough to cater for everyone in all areas. 'I wouldn't even say 15 stone is a particularly obese weight, and therefore I would worry for the safety of all patients, regardless of their size. 'Surely a 15 stone person wouldn't be a hazard? I'd like to hear how they came up with the weight ban.' Campaigners have slammed the restriction as 'completely unacceptable' and denying overweight patients their rights . The news comes just a week after a senior nurse at Dr Gray's spoke out about suspected stroke victims and patients with heart problems passing out in chairs because of a severe shortage of beds. The affected ward, which had 15 beds, closed in August last year after it was deemed unsuitable for modern health care needs. But the area has been reopened after NHS Grampian admitted it has been tough to find beds for everyone since. An NHS Grampian spokeswoman defended the restrictions on people weighing over 15 stone. She said: 'The former ward 10 at Dr Gray's is currently the temporary home of the Acute Medical Assessment Unit and the Rehab unit.""When the reconfiguration work at the hospital is complete, these services will move out of this area and into refurbished accommodation. 'The reconfiguration project is aimed at moving - once and for all - all in-patient accommodation out of the oldest parts of the building, which are no longer in line with modern health care needs. 'However, to allow this project to go ahead, we need to use the former ward 10, on a temporary basis, as a turning space. 'There is no other suitable accommodation available at Dr Gray's. We worked very closely with Grampian Fire and Rescue Service prior to this move, staging a worst case scenario simulated evacuation. 'This was observed throughout by Grampian Fire and Rescue Service. They asked us to introduce a 15 stone limit on patients and we agreed. 'Once the reconfiguration work is complete, the former ward 10 and associated areas will be used for a range of day case work, including chemotherapy. 'This work represents a £3million investment in Dr Gray's by NHS Grampian and will result in a vastly improved environment for patients and staff. 'As has been acknowledged, the hospital is very busy at the moment. We are incredibly grateful for the hard work of our staff and the understanding of our patients.'","Rule imposed at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, Scotland .

"By . Emma Innes . As all cat owners know, stroking a purring pet can be very therapeutic. Now, a Parisian café is attempting to bring the experience to city-dwellers who are unable to keep their own cat. Customers the café are able to enjoy their coffee and croissants with a cat on their lap - which is said to bring a host of benefits from easing pain to lowering blood pressure. A new cafe in Paris is allowing people to drink their coffee with one of its 12 resident cats on their lap - bringing supposed health benefits . The ‘Café des Chats’, in the heart of the chic Marais district, has 12 resident cats who weave between the tables and curl up on the armchairs. The manager, Margaux Gandelon, says that she hopes customers will benefit from ‘purr therapy’ which she claims can have a range of health benefits. She said: ‘Purring produces vibrations which relieve arthritis and rheumatism and which lower your blood pressure and your heartbeat.’ This month's opening weekend saw queues snaking along the pavement and bookings taken from now until November. The launch was so popular that some 300 potential customers had to be turned away. Ms Gandelon says animal welfare is paramount and customers are prohibited from subjecting the cats to undue stress. The 'Café des Chats', in the heart of the chic Marais district, has 12 resident cats who weave between the tables and curl up on the armchairs . She is prepared to evict any customers who fail to play by the rules although she admits she is more lenient with the animal residents: ‘Cats are cats,’ she told Reuters. The animals themselves are all abandoned and stray cats adopted from pet rescue centres. Among them is Habby who suffers from feline dwarfism with a stunted tail and unusually short legs. Despite two years spent with foster families the tabby was never adopted but has now settled down to café life. The manager, Margaux Gandelon, says that she hopes customers will benefit from 'purr therapy' which she claims can have a range of health benefits . Visiting the cafe out of curiosity, business student Florian Laboureau described it as a ‘great concept’, but admitted he is more of a dog person. Numerous studies have highlighted the health benefits of owning cats. For example, one study suggested owning a pet can reduce a person’s chances of developing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma by nearly a third, researchers claim. Animal lovers are much less likely to develop the cancer of the lymphatic system that affects around 9,000 Britons a year. Margaux Gandelon said: 'Purring produces vibrations which relieve arthritis and rheumatism and which lower your blood pressure and your heartbeat' Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, and Stanford University, also in California, who carried out the study believe pets help protect against cancer by boosting the immune system. Previous studies have also shown children who have pets take fewer sick days off school because they are more resistant to infections. Some research even suggests toddlers who grow up around cats or dogs are less likely to suffer allergies or asthma.","Café des Chats has 12 resident cats adopted from rescue shelters .

"By . John Naish . For any parent, having to accept your child needs psychiatric drugs must be agonising. But when Susan Bevis's 13-year-old daughter Amy suffered a breakdown after a vicious campaign of school bullying, it seemed the only option - as instructed by NHS psychiatrists. However Susan, a secretary from Enfield, North London, was horrified by the physical and mental damage the antipsychotic medication wreaked on her daughter. Amy's ordeal began when she simply fell out with a clique of girls - the situation steadily worsened and she faced constant online bullying as well as being physically attacked in class. Gangs started to follow her home, and the family house and car were damaged. Neither the police nor school seemed able to do anything. Strain: Amy Bevis, age 10 (left) before her ordeals began, and age 13 (right), several months after she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and started taking antipsychotics . Under this terrible strain, Amy began to break down. After months of sleeplessness and extreme anxiety, she said she'd begun to hear voices in her head. Her mother sought medical help. Instead of being offered counselling and social support, Amy was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as having 'first-rank schizophrenia', which means she had signs of the condition. Susan was initially sceptical, but was so anxious to get help she reluctantly agreed to Amy being given medication - this was Risperdal, an antipsychotic that changes the way chemicals in the brain work. 'The results were shocking,' recalls Susan. 'After only a matter of weeks, her slim body ballooned, her legs were like tree trunks, her eyes became dead-looking, her hair was lank and she felt constantly tired.' Although her 'schizophrenic' symptoms were relieved, she was bullied even more. Worried, Susan researched the drug. 'The official information said it had never been trialled on children. I was shocked. Amy wanted to come off it, so I agreed.' Worryingly, Amy seemed to relapse, suffering from hallucinations again. 'But in fact, she was suffering withdrawal symptoms from the drug,' says Susan, and after weeks of agony, the symptoms began to subside. The solution to her problems was to move school. Susan, now a single mother, scrimped and saved to send Amy to a theatre school - 'it was the making of her,' she says. 'My daughter has wanted to be an actress since she was four. It gave her an interest - and an interest is a way of distracting a child from trauma.' Amy is 22 now and is, says her mother, 'happy and on top of the world'. She's starting her career on the stage, having graduated with a university degree in theatre arts. 'The truth is that my daughter never had “first-rank schizophrenia” - she was being bullied and was under terrible stress.' Dismissive: Susan has become a vociferous critic of the psychiatric community's readiness to label children as mentally ill and give them potentially damaging drugs . Susan is full of scorn for the psychiatric community's readiness to label children as mentally ill then give them powerful and potentially damaging drugs. She's become a vociferous critic on the subject, appearing at conferences and pressure groups around Britain. She is particularly dismissive of the way psychiatrists often make their diagnosis using the profession's 'bible', the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), just published in its fifth version. The manual is written by an influential committee of U.S. psychiatrists and lists official diagnoses and symptoms - its clinical definitions are used by professionals the world over as a guide for labelling psychiatric illnesses, and giving drug treatment. One of the major criticisms is that the number of new psychiatric diagnoses added to it is rising exponentially. In 1952, the manual was 130 pages long. The fifth edition has 992 pages. And this latest edition has controversially added new diagnoses such as 'Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder', which essentially makes children's temper tantrums a mental illness. Critics believe the manuals are 'disease mongering' - inventing labels for conditions that don't really exist, but are normal, albeit difficult, facets of human nature. 'If you look at the DSM-5 there is a diagnosis for everyone. But there is no scientific proof to back many of them,' says Susan, adding, only half in jest: 'No doubt they would have a diagnosis for me, as I have challenged the psychiatrists about their care.' One might expect such scepticism from a mother with a bad experience of the psychiatric profession. But the fact is that spiralling numbers of British children are being diagnosed with 'mental health problems' that may often be merely behavioural. Disturbingly, this trend is affecting children at ever younger ages. Recent British figures show that 650,000 children between the ages of eight and 13 are on the drug Ritalin for the behavioural problem, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD ) - up from just 9,000 two decades ago. And now one of the world's leading psychiatrists has blown the lid off this burgeoning problem. Dr Allen Frances chaired the taskforce that wrote the previous version of the DSM, in 1994. At the time, he was described by the New York Times as 'the most powerful psychiatrist in America'. But now he admits his version of the manual helped open the floodgates for an epidemic of over-diagnosis of children's mental illness  and mass over-medication, with potentially devastating side-effects. 'In the past 20 years, diagnosis rates of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have tripled, while autistic disorder and childhood bipolar disorder have each increased by a remarkable 40-fold,' says Dr Frances, an emeritus professor at Duke University School of Medicine in South Carolina. 'This is not because our kids have suddenly become sicker, it's just that diagnoses are applied to them more loosely.' He fears the latest edition will make the problem even worse. The result has been a bonanza for the pharmaceutical industry. For example over the past 20 years, the worldwide value of the market for ADHD drugs alone has grown from £11 million to £11 billion a year. And the long-term effects of these drugs on children remains a perilous unknown, because rigorous safety checks were not performed on children before the medicines were launched. 'It is a mass public health experiment that has been done without anyone's informed consent,' says Dr Frances. 'We have no idea about the long-term effects. 'We do know that in the short term antipsychotic drugs cause tremendous weight gain. A child weighing 110lb will put on 12lb in only 12 weeks. This is bound to be a factor for diabetes and heart disease. There is also controversy over whether the long-term use of brain-stimulating drugs causes children to grow up likely to become adult drug abusers.' The fear is that Ritalin-type medications are so similar to amphetamine or cocaine they create addictive yearnings in young brains that may lead to later drug abuse. There are also concerns that ADHD medication damages young brains in similar ways to cocaine which, ironically, may make them into impulsive and antisocial adults. 'Whatever the long-term effect of these stimulant medications, we do know that they are being over-used massively because of over-diagnosis,' says Dr Frances. 'And being wrongly told you have a mental problem at a young age can have a crippling effect for life.' He is particularly worried by the new addition to DSM-5 of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder. 'The idea of turning temper tantrums into a mental disorder is terrible,' he says. Futhermore, 'the criteria for diagnosing it were pretty much conjured out of thin air'. Growth: Over the past 20 years, the worldwide value of the market for ADHD drugs alone has grown from £11 million to £11 billion a year . Tellingly, in France, where they shun the DSM, the proportion of kids diagnosed and medicated for ADHD is less than half a per cent. In Britain it's around 4 per cent. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is keen to play down the influence of the manual, however. 'NHS psychiatrists in their daily practice tend to use another set of psychiatric-illness classifications - the International Classification of Disease, which is published by the World Health Organisation,' says a spokeswoman. 'The Royal College recognises there are some valid criticisms of the DSM approach. All diagnostic classifications in medicine have been, and always will be, evolving and ready to be improved in response to new scientific evidence.' In the meantime there is more medication on the way. In February the UK drug regulator granted a licence for a new class of ADHD drug, Elvanse, approved for children six and older who haven't responded to Ritalin-type medication, despite a list of known side-effects, such as anxiety, weight loss, stunted growth and heart problems. As Dr Frances knows only too well, it is very easy to add new diagnoses and drugs for children. But it is very difficult indeed to reverse this pharmaceutical tide. As his interview with Good Health drew to a close, he gave a deep sigh and warned: 'We are turning childhood into a disease.'

"By . Scarlett Russell . Christy Turlington is the face of British Vogue next month, exactly 28 years after her first appearance on the fashion bible’s coveted cover. The American model, 45, who has worked in the industry for over three decades, shot to fame in the late eighties when she landed a contract with Calvin Klein that ended up spanning 20 years. Along with Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, Christy is regarded as part of the original supermodel clan of the 1990s. She's back! 18 years after her first ever cover for British Vogue, Christy Turlington graces the magazine's July issue . Strike a pose: Christy Turlington's first ever British Vogue cover in July 1986, left, and appearing on the magazine's cover again in 1990 with fellow superstar models (L-R) Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Cindy Crawford . This will be Christy’s 15th British Vogue cover. In July 1986 she wore Donna Karan and was shot by Patrick Demarchelier for her first British Vogue cover. In November 1987 she was on the cover again, this time shot by Brit David Baily. In 1990, she appeared on the magazine again, with Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Cindy Crawford, for what is still regarded as one of the most iconic covers and captures the young, fresh-faced models on the cusp of their phenomenal success as leading supermodels and international celebrities. Born in California in 1969, Christy’s family moved to Miami when she was in school and her father was working as a training captain for Pan Am. It was in Florida that she was discovered by a local photographer Dennie Cody whilst she was horse riding. She began modelling for local departments stores after school when she was 14, and moved to New York to pursue the career full-time when she was 18. Fashion darling: Christy Turlington (centre) was one of the biggest supermodels of the 1990s, pictured here on the Versace catwalk in the mid-90s with Gianni Verscae (left) and fellow supermodel Helena Christensen (right) Supermodel stardom: (l-r) Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington at the Versace Autumn Winter Fashion Show, Milan, Italy in 1991. They were some of the biggest names - and faces - in fashion . Fresh-faced: (L-R) Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Christy Turlington, at the Versace for Africa Fashion Show in in 1998 . She has since appeared on over 500 magazine covers and numerous ad campaigns including Maybelline and Versace. As well as her astounding modelling career, Christy has been an advocate for a number of charities. She modelled naked for animal-rights groups PETA in 1993 and, in 2005, began working with the international humanitarian organization CARE. She has since become their Advocate for Maternal Health and is an ambassador for Product Red. In 1994, at the height of her career, Christy took a break from modelling to focus on her college degree. She graduated in 1999 from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study of New York University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a concentration in Comparative Religion and Eastern Philosophy. ‘I never thought I would model for more than a few years,’ she told Interview magazine last year. ‘Each year I would say ""one more year,"" and that got old. So, after one particularly gruelling season at the couture shows in Paris in the summer of '94, I decided that was it. I came home and applied to NYU and started classes that fall.’ Hotting up: Christy Turlington and her actor husband Ed Burns appear in the latest advert for Calvin Klein's Eternity fragrance . Strutting her stuff: Christy walks for Valetino during Paris Fashion Week in the '90s . Over her 31 year career she has walked in catwalk shows for Versace, Christian Lacroix, Vivienne Weswtood, Thierry Mulger amongst others. ‘While I . haven't worked as a full-time model for about 20 years, I've always . maintained a few relationships,’ she told Interview. ‘Calvin . and Maybelline are the two longest. I'm flattered by the offers I . receive, but there's no real strategy to the way I choose what to do . these days. If I'm in a good mood and have the time, I'm more likely to . consider it.’ As the face of Calvin Klein, Christy fronted dozens of underwear and fragrance campaigns for the brand - she even currently appears in an advert for its iconic Eternity perfume with her actor husband of 11 years, Ed Burns. Wonder woman: Christy Turlington walking for Versace. Next month she appears on British Vogue for the 18th time . Christy was the fragrance's first face, back in 1988. ‘In the beginning we were pretty giggly,’ she told The LA Times of the couple’s sexy shoot. ‘After the first day, Ed said to me, “I'm so glad you're not doing this with somebody else.” I said “I wouldn't be doing this with someone else.” Usually you pretend to be intimate on these types of campaigns, and when they go to change a lens or the roll of film is complete, you're like, “So, how about those Mets?” It's just awkward.’ Last year Christy modelled another underwear campaign for Calvin Klein, for which they paid $5 million to her not-for-profit charity she set up, Every Mother Counts. She launched the organization in 2010 to end preventable deaths caused by childbirth. She herself suffered heavy bleeding following the birth of her first child.

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . With nine months of pregnancy behind them and the prospect of endless sleepless nights ahead, it is little wonder that new mothers don’t feel at their most attractive. New fathers, however, have no such qualms. In fact they think they are more handsome than before. The scientists who made the discovery said that having physical proof of virility may give the male ego a boost. New fathers, such as JLS's Marvin Humes, believe they are more handsome than before - perhaps because physical proof of virility gives the male ego a boost and reinforces masculinity . The US researchers quizzed almost 200 . couples about how attractive they felt on a scale ranging from ‘very ugly’ to ‘perfectly beautiful’ or ‘ultimately handsome’. The men and women rated themselves just after their wedding and then again close to their first and second anniversaries. Forty eight of the 182 couples had a baby during this two-year period. The women who didn’t have a child felt more attractive over time. However, the others felt less appealing after their baby was born, the Journal of Gender Studies reports. In contrast, becoming a father appeared to boost a man’s opinion of himself. University of California researcher . Alicia Cast said new mothers may still be struggling to cope with the . physical changes to their body. Dr Cast, a social psychologist, said: . ‘First-time mothers report surprise at the extent to which their bodies . have changed and how long it takes to “get their bodies back” which can . lead to women feeling frumpy. The researchers found that first-time mothers reported surprise at the extent to which their bodies had changed, which led to them feeling frumpy . ‘Women are aware that their bodies are . scrutinised even in pregnancy and they seem to become more self-critical . regarding their appearance as a result of the pregnancy.’ Fathers, however, may benefit from feeling they have proved their masculinity. The researcher said: ‘There are strong connections between virility, fertility and masculinity for men. ‘Men who are diagnosed as infertile report feeling their masculinity threatened. ‘So, for men, having a child may serve to enhance feelings of masculinity, resulting in men feeling more attractive. ‘The fact that the women were negatively . affected and the men were positively affected by the birth of a child . is consistent with other research that suggests that men are less likely . than women to experience the “costs” of having children. ‘Indeed, research suggests that husbands . place more importance on having children and are more likely to say . they want children than women.’ She added that new fathers shouldn’t feel too smug, as their belief they are more attractive soon fades. She also said that as her data came from marriages in the 1990s, more research is needed to check the same is true today.","U.S. researchers quizzed couples about how attractive they felt on a scale ranging from ‘very ugly’

A three-year-old girl was saved from the killer disease meningitis after her mother checked her symptoms on an iPhone app. Hollie Weeks was saved by her quick-thinking mother Claire after she became seriously ill on holiday. Mrs Weeks had downloaded the Meningitis Trust app after a classmate of her other daughter died after contracting the condition. Hollie was diagnosed with viral meningitis and received treatment within 20 minutes of showing symptoms thanks to her mother's quick actions . Erica, 6, Claire and Hollie, 3: Claire was quick to take action when Hollie developed meningitis symptoms after a class mate of Erica's died from the condition . Hollie suffered a stroke down her right side but is now recovering well . Claire, 36, and father Simon, 39, from Kingswood, Bristol, rushed her to North Devon District Hospital on April 29. The youngster was diagnosed with viral meningitis and received treatment within 20 minutes. However, . she still suffered a stroke down her right side and lost her speech. She spent two days in the Barnstaple hospital, 12 days at Bristol . Children’s Hospital, and 11 days at Frenchay Hospital. But Hollie, nicknamed 'little miracle' by doctors, is now battling back to health thanks to her parents’ swift actions. She has regained most of her mobility, although still has co-ordination problems with her right hand. Hollie struggles to concentrate for long . periods and tires easily, but the family are hoping that before the end . of the year she will no longer need the steroids she is on. Claire, from Bristol, said: 'The doctors said she was an hour away from not pulling through. She’s made a remarkable recovery. 'Our brave girl suffered a stroke and lost her speech, but Hollie is a little fighter and is doing well learning to talk and with physiotherapy. 'She has some weakness down her right side, but this could have been so much worse. We feel lucky to still have her here and she has returned to play school. 'I cannot thank the hospital staff enough as they helped save her life. 'The team at Frenchay’s Barbara Russell Unit call her a ‘little miracle’ for how fast she is recovering and is still doing its best to make sure she gets back to health. 'Hollie knows what happened to her. She says ""I had meningitis on holiday and the doctors saved me"".' Mrs Weeks became conscious of the . risks of meningitis earlier this year after five-year-old Kelsey Smart - . a classmate of Hollie's older sister Erica - died from the condition. What is meningitis?An infection that can affect the blood, organs and the thin layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord.What are the symptoms?They include high fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, rash, confusion and severe sleepiness.How is the disease spread?The disease is usually spread by contact with fluids from the nose and mouth of the infected person, most commonly by coughing, sneezing or kissing.Can it be prevented by vaccine?Yes, but the vaccines are not 100 per cent effective, and they do not protect against certain strains of the bacteria. She said: 'What happened to Kelsey and her family is heartbreaking. 'What Hannah and James are doing to remember her and spread awareness is so special. If it weren’t for their determination, I would not have suspected meningitis and rushed Hollie to hospital. 'Our . little girl could have died, but what we learned from Kelsey’s story . was enough to get us to rush our daughter to hospital, which saved her . life. 'If my family can . spread awareness of meningitis through our and Kelsey’s stories, and . save even one life - it will be worth it.' The Kesley Smart awareness campaign is run in aid of Meningitis UK. The early symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia can include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and muscle and joint pain. These can often look like other more . common illnesses like flu. Symptoms can worsen rapidly so it's important . to keep checking them. The . Meningitis Trust says parents should trust their instincts. 'You know . your child, a loved one, or your own body, better than anyone else. If . you think it is meningitis, say so,' they advise.

"By . Katy Winter . Many people will know the embarrassment of being asked if they're pregnant, when in fact they're just carrying a few extra pounds. However few will have reacted quite like one mother-of-three, who lost a staggering 10 stone after her son asked her if she was having a baby. Gemma Davies, from Llanelli, South Wales, was so shocked by her then 10-year-old son’s words that she signed up to a local slimming group to shift her 21 stone weight.

Then a trim 9 stone, Gemma ate cakes and chocolate to satisfy her pregnancy cravings. Speaking about her weight gain, she said: 'Before I knew it, I’d piled on six stone. ‘I felt very lonely as a single mum, so I’d raid the supermarket shelves for whatever chocolate bars or ready meals I wanted. 'My family didn’t want to upset me, so no-one ever said anything about my weight. But at family gatherings they’d pass their leftovers down the table for me to finish.' In just a year, 5 ft 8” Gemma shot up to 21 stone, and felt ashamed of her size 24 figure. Soon after, she met her future husband, Stuart, 32, and put on more weight. She said: 'Stuart loved me exactly the way I was, and I didn’t have to hide my weight struggles with him. New figure: Now 11 stone and a size 10, Gemma says her sons give her cuddles and tell her how pretty she looks . 'But when I fell pregnant with our son Thomas, I was too busy to cook proper meals. I’d make the boys a healthy dinner, but we would scoff late night takeaways after they’d gone to bed.

A chocolate that is good for the heart has been developed – and could be on sale in months. Acticoa, a dark chocolate containing health-boosting plant chemicals called flavanols, is made by Swiss company Barry Callebaut. Tests show that it increases the elasticity of blood vessels by 1 to 2 per cent, making it easier for blood to flow. Research shows that an improvement of 1 . per cent cuts the risk of cardiovascular problems, including heart . attacks, by 8 per cent. Cocoa . beans are naturally high in flavanols but they are normally stripped . out during processing. Barry Callebaut has made adjustments to its . processing technique, to preserve the flavanols. Spokesman . Marijke De Brouwer said: ‘This is not about artificially adding a . nutrient – it is about preserving what is already present in cocoa.’ A . Chocolate Industry Network conference heard recently that interest in . Acticoa is high, as the European Commission has given permission to . carry a health claim. Wrappers will be able to state that . ‘cocoa flavanols help maintain the elasticity of blood vessels, which . contributes to normal blood flow’. But . Angus Kennedy, of trade magazine Kennedy’s Confection, questioned . whether Britons will embrace a healthy version of something meant to be a . treat. He said: ‘We must always remember that chocolate is more or less 50 per cent sugar and 50 per cent fat. ‘If you wanted to increase your blood flow, you’d probably go for a jog or take a walk in the park.’ Healthy: Cocoa beans are naturally high in flavanols but they are normally stripped out during processing . Studies also credit Acticoa chocolate with a host of other health benefits, from fighting wrinkles to sharpening the mind. Cocoa beans are naturally high in flavanols but they are normally destroyed or stripped out during processing. Although you may never have heard of Barry Callebaut, it is likely to have made one in five of the squares of chocolate that pass your lips. The 1,400,000 tonnes of chocolate made by the firm each year help supply household names including Cadbury’s and Thorntons, as well as caters and chefs and it has British factories in Banbury and St Helen’s.","Acticoa contains health-boosting plant chemicals called flavanols .

When asked . why they believe their undies are lucky, almost half the nation said it . was because they felt comfortable in them. But for one third of Brits it is simply because something positive had happened . whilst wearing them. Celebrities such as Katy Perry also seem to be following the trend. According . to the New York Daily News, the ‘ROAR’ singer bought President Obama . his own pair of lucky underwear at a political rally in London just . before he won the 2012 election. Ant McPartlin claims he hasn't made a live appearance in 25 years without donning his lucky white underwear . And . here in the UK,  ITV presenter Ant McPartlin claims he hasn’t made a . live appearance in 25 years without donning his lucky white underwear. Like Ant, most men aren’t too daring when it comes to what’s down under, with almost 50 per cent wearing boxers in either traditional black (25 per cent) or blue (18 per cent). When it comes to patterns, vertical stripes came up top, followed by horizontal strips and checkered squares. Black (23 per cent), red (21 per cent) and white (20 per cent) were the most popular colours amongst the ladies in a ‘classic style’ brief, with almost a quarter (24 per cent) of women slipping them on to increase their chances of getting lucky. Red hearts came out on top as the most popular ‘lucky’ pattern with 12 per cent of the vote, followed by flowers (10 per cent), polka dots (9 per cent), and stars (8 per cent). Donna Dawson, a psychologist . specialising in Personality and Behaviour, explains: 'Lucky undies . become ‘lucky’ because their owners connect wearing them to positive . events, and continue to be ‘lucky’ because their owners believe in their . power. 'Wearing . the lucky pair becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they make people . feel more comfortable, relaxed and confident, which in turn make them . better able to recognise and respond to positive opportunities that come . along. 'Lucky . items such as underwear give people a sense of power and control over . their environment, which is really what good luck is all about.' Katy Perry apparently bought President Obama his own pair of lucky underwear at a rally in London just before he won the 2012 election . A spokesman for Mecca Bingo explains: 'Our customers have all kinds of lucky rituals from jewellery to cuddly toys. 'We know that lucky undies are also a popular choice, so we thought why not find out what the nation’s luckiest pair would look like, and create them and make them available to our customers.' The money raised will go to the Carers . Trust which Mecca Bingo supports nationwide. And for those nowhere near . the Essex region, a limited number will also available via Mecca Bingo’s . social media channels, where fans are able to try their luck to win a . pair.","A quarter of Britons claims to have won money whilst wearing 'lucky' pants .

"By . Deni Kirkova . A besotted dog owner has spent an astounding £5,000 on a birthday party for her beloved pet. Karen Chamberlain, 52, from Dover splashed out on a glamorous bash for her female bulldog, Lady Lola, to mark the fact she had survived to 10 years old despite being given just five years to live after a devastating house fire in 2005. The professional dog breeder, who specialises in bulldogs, hired a lavish beach club where Lola sat upon a specially-made throne and dressed in a £150 dress and £100 tiara. Lola gets ready for the party with the help of besotted owner Karen, 52, who spent £5,000 on it . The pair were joined by dozens of doggy friends who tucked into a 10-tier cake and enjoyed live entertainment. Karen, who has no children, said: 'People think I'm mad - I've been called ""barking"" more than once - but it's only common sense to me that Lola should have had a tutu and a throne for her ""100th birthday"", considering her rocky journey in life. 'She's really like one of my children.' Karen narrowly saved Lola and Lola's puppy Tia from a cloud of toxic smoke which filled her house when a coffee pot melted in an unexplained fire. She said: 'I raced through the house looking for them. 'Both the dogs were succumbing to the fumes and I had to practically throw Lola through an open door into the fresh air. Lola pictured sitting on her throne (l) and a wide shot of the throne and 10-tier birthday cake . The pair were joined by dozens of doggy friends who tucked into cake and enjoyed live entertainment . 'By the time I found Tia she was nearly dead. I had to give her mouth to mouth. 'We had to take both dogs to intensive care at the Royal Veterinary College in London where they stayed for two weeks, at a cost of £18,000. We almost lost them several times. 'The vets told us we should prepare ourselves for the fact that they wouldn't live for another five years. I was devastated, but I took them home and nursed them as best I could. It took them a full year to properly recover. 'Lola survived the five years, and then another, and I began to think, 'wow, she's a real survivor'.' Last year, as Lola approached her 10th birthday, Karen decided to throw an extra-special bash to celebrate her eldest dog's life so far. Karen also keeps five other bulldogs, Baby Gracie, 6, triplets Angel Star, Lil' Belle and Scarley Sky, 4, and King, 9 months, who with her fiance Pete Dowling, 5. Lola arrives at the party with Karen and her fiance Pete Dowling, 51 . She said: 'I invited all our dog-mad friends. I wanted it to be a very glamorous evening. 'The dress code was quite strict - I wanted all the ladies and gents to be dressed in their finest gear and their dogs were to wear fancy dress. We had one dog dressed up as Prince Charming, and others were dyed especially for the occasion.' The venue, the Beach Club marquee at the Kings Oak Hotel in Loughton, Essex, cost £1,000 to hire for the night. Lola's dress cost £150, and her tiara cost another £100. The decorations, food and entertainment, including a specially-constructed throne, a 10-tier cupcake tower, individual treat bowls, celebrity lookalikes and dancers, brought the total cost to £5,000. Individual treat bowls for canine guests at the party (l) as Pete gives Lola her cake . Karen said: 'We considered it Lola's 100th birthday because bulldogs generally do not live as long as some breeds. Every year equals 10 dog years. 'Lola really enjoyed her big day. She loves a fuss being made of her, and it obviously did her some good.' Sadly Tia, Lola's daughter, died in April this year, but Lola is still going strong. Karen said: 'She still acts like a puppy. She enjoys playing with her toys a bit too much sometimes and still gets excited meeting other dogs. 'Every day we take her for two short walks and when we're going longer distances we take her out in her stroller. She loves walking on the sand. 'We were once told that Lola only had a few short years to live, but she's amazingly strong.'

"By . Katy Winter . Andy Murray is facing rising star Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon today, and while the two tennis titans clash on court, their respective other halves were expected to be cheering them on in the stands. But while devoted Kim Sears arrived at SW19 looking chic and relatively cheerful ahead of what is sure to be a nail-biting game, there was no sign of Maria Sharapova, who yesterday crashed out of the competition in a humiliating match against Angelique Kerber. While demure Kim has been a constant . presence at Wimbledon this year - as ever, immaculately blow-dried - Maria has yet to be seen in the stands. Devoted Kim arrived at Wimbledon alone today, while Dimitrov's girlfriend Maria Sharapova was a no-show . Kim put on her own 'game face' as she strode into the stadium to watch the quarter final in a bold pink sleeved dress . Sticking to a well-established formula Kim, 25, wore a knee-length bright pink scoop necked dress by Goat, £440, and the same Burberry wedges she has been seen in every day of the competition so far. And of course she carried her loved Aspinal Marylebone tote bag - which costs an eye-watering £1395 - as she walked into the stadium. While Kim kept up her unwavering support for her partner, Maria Sharapova was noticeably absent. Until now the Russian has naturally been more concerned with her own game than supporting boyfriend Dimitrov, whom she has been dating since 2012. But yesterday saw the 27-year-old suffer a humiliating shock defeat to German ninth seed Angelique Kerber, ending her dreams of a Wimbledon title, and she was expected to show support to Dimitrov at the match today. As Kim took her place in the stands, her trademark blow-dried hair was shown off to its very best . Kim has been a rock to Murray, supporting him from the stands - and reportedly cooking him dinner each evening . Kim looked relaxed as she smiled and joked with friends, carrying her much loved £1,395 Marylebone tote . Kim's hair looked as glossy and perfectly styled as it has on her other four visits to Wimbledon . Kim, who has been dating Andy for nine years, has attended all of his matches thus far in the championship . While leaving the competition is no doubt a huge blow to the ambitious blonde, it has freed her up to watch boyfriend Dimitrov in action. The pair began dating in 2012, but only confirmed their relationship in 2013 after the Madrid Open, and while she is known for a will of iron, she may find her hands are full with the 23-year-old Bulgarian. His talent and good looks have seen Dimitrov make something of a name for himself as a ladies' man. He has previously dated Sharapova’s on-court enemy, Serena Williams - at 32 another older woman - and the relationship had a famously acrimonious end. Serena, who was defeated by Sharapova in the 2004 Wimbledon final, has spoken out about Dimitrov, giving an interview to a US magazine in which she described Sharapova as ‘boring’ and accused Dimitrov of having a ‘black heart’. Nevertheless, Sharapova seems smitten with the buff Bulgarian and responded by pointing out that Williams was believed to be dating her married coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. Maria Sharapova and Grigor Dimitrov have been dating since 2012 but she did not turn up to watch him on court today . Maria Sharapova yesterday lost on Centre Court against Angelique Kerber . The 6ft 2in blonde, who has previously said that she feels Dimitrov's tennis is of a better standard than her own, was spotted supporting him in the stands as he won the French Open last month. While it's unlikely Maria follows Kim’s example and cooks for her man each evening of the tournament - being too busy working on her own game - Dimitrov has credited his other half with helping his performance, saying: ‘She’s just been unbelievable supporting me throughout the year.’ Now that she's got a bit of spare time, the 27-year-old plans to visit Sugarpova, the pop-up sweet shop she has opened down the road from the All England Club. ‘I love going there, my favourite sweet is a liquorice with a marshmallow middle and strawberry flavour,’ she gushed. It appears that when it comes to style Kim Sears is taking inspiration from the Royal Box. Andy Murrey's doting girlfriend arrived for Wimbledon today in a pink knee-length dress that looked strangely familiar. The dress bore an uncanny resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge's frock that she wore to her visit to a primary school in Highbury and Islington, North London, yesterday. Both dresses come from luxury brand Goat, the label that began as the go-to cashmere range for the fashion connoisseurs over ten years ago. But the similarities didn't end there. Both dresses have a conservative shape, tucking neatly in at the waist and finishing just below the knee. Kim even opted for identical colours with both dresses coming in an eye-catching hot-pink colour. Both Kim and Kate's dresses were finished with buckle detailing at the waist, but Kim kept to a slightly shorter sleeve for the hot summer weather. It appears that when it comes to the Kate Effect nobody is immune!","Kim opted for a bold pink dress for her fifth time at Wimbledon .

"By . Katy Winter . TV presenter Holly Willoughby has been named the celebrity with the best-dressed bump, picking up  almost a quarter (24 per cent) of the vote . The survey quizzed 620 women on who they thought had the most stylish bump from a list of famous faces. Hot on Holly’s heels was Girls Aloud star Kimberley Walsh who’s due to have her first baby later on this year. Scroll down for video . Holly Willoughby, (pictured left with This Morning co-host Phillip Schofield), tends to opt for chic and comfortable options to see her through her pregnancy in style - a strategy that has won her many fans . Kimberley Walsh, who came second in the poll, gently patted her baby bump as she arrived at BBC Breakfast in Manchester on Monday . Not to be outdone by her sister, Kourtney Kardashian has been looking particularly stylish during her third pregnancy . The pop star picked up 21 per cent of the vote and was praised for her stylish, body-con maternity wear. American socialite Kourtney Kardashian, who’s pregnant with her third child, came third in the poll, with 15 per cent of the vote. She was followed by TOWIE star Billie Faiers, who’s due to give birth to her first baby with partner Greg Shepherd in July, with 14 per cent of the women agreeing she had the most stylish bump. US movie star Mila Kunis came in at fifth place with nine per cent of the vote. The women questioned loved her relaxed maternity style. Actresses Scarlett Johansson (left) and Mila Kunis (right) ranked in sixth and fifth place respectively . Scarlett Johannson picked up seven per cent of the vote, with model mum-to-be Erin O’Connor coming in at seventh place, with six per cent agreeing she dressed her bump well. Athlete Jessica Ennis Hill took the eighth spot with three per cent of the vote, with X Factor winner Sam Bailey coming in at number nine with just one per cent.

A third commented: 'Katie Price’s taste in maternity fashion leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the pictures I’ve seen of her are downright garish, and in others she seems to prefer to show off her growing belly and leave it undressed.' A spokesperson for My1stYears.com, who conducted the survey, said: 'When you’re pregnant, especially towards the latter stages, the priority has to be staying cool and comfortable, rather than following fashion and wearing the most stylish outfit you can find.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Just a few years ago, Eugenie Bouchard was awestruck when she met her childhood hero – five-time Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova. But after the 20-year-old reached the Wimbledon finals yesterday, she announced that she no longer dreams of being the next Sharapova. ‘I don’t want to be the next someone else. I want to be the first of me,’ the glamorous player announced with steely determination, days after the Russian former world No.1 crashed out of the tournament. Scroll down for video . Crowd favourite: Canadian Eugenie Bouchard has reached the women's final at Wimbledon . Winner! Eugenie Bouchard of Canada celebrates after winning her Ladies' Singles semi-final match against Simona Halep of Romania . Showing her fun side: Eugenie Bouchard (right) shared this snap of her and her twin sister, Beatrice, in a sexy police officer outfit . Miss Bouchard, who has been embraced by tennis fans as the tournament’s sweetheart, said she would now ‘try to make my own history’. The Canadian – named after the British princess by her royalist mother – took a step closer to being crowned queen of the court after beating 22-year-old Romanian Simona Halep. She is the first Canadian woman to make it to a Grand Slam singles final. Ranked 13th in the world, she said she was ‘not surprised’ that she had beaten world No.3 Halep, because she had worked so hard for it. The player has acquired a loyal fanbase dubbed ‘Genie’s Army’ since winning the Wimbledon juniors two years ago and has received countless offers of marriage on Twitter. Asked about the marriage proposals last night, she smiled: ‘There is always a chance that I’ll say yes over Twitter, so keep them coming.’ As we're used to seeing her:  Eugenie, 20, is set to face Simona Halep in the Wimbledon semi-finals today, is in with a genuine chance of winning the women's singles . Her semi-final match was not without drama and it took six match points before Miss Bouchard finally won, which she admitted was ‘a little stressful’. Her mother Julie Leclair said afterwards: ‘I was very nervous. Watching was a bit like going to the dentist but we are so proud of her.’ Miss Bouchard has described her mother as a ‘royal nut’ who named all four of her children after royalty. Her twin sister Beatrice and brother William are also named after members of the Royal Family, while younger sister Charlotte is named after Princess Caroline of Monaco’s daughter. William, 15, who has attended all of his sister’s matches at Wimbledon this year, said: ‘It’s amazing. All of my friends can’t believe my sister is top in the tennis world.’ And Beatrice, who claims to have a telepathic link with her twin, said recently: ‘Every day I am just in awe. I have seen everything she has missed out on in childhood and teenage years. She has sacrificed a lot to get where she is today.’ Miss Bouchard prepared for the tournament by pulling a weighted sledge across American football fields and jumping over hurdles. She also ran along sandy beaches in Florida, where she has been training since she was 12. ‘It’s getting really physical nowadays, the game, so you’ve got to be in top shape,’ she said. She is a huge fan of singer Justin Bieber but said he would need to ‘clean up his act’ before she would consider dating him.","Eugenie Bouchard, 20, beat Halep 7-6, 6-2 .

"By . John Naish . Night of the living: A new study shows that people undergoing heart surgery have a lower death rate if their operation is done when the moon is starting to wane . For thousands of years, people feared the moon could change us into werewolves or even mermaids. These days, alternative health gurus sell calendars that show the 'best' lunar phase for losing weight (supposedly a waning moon - one that is getting smaller in the sky) or using face packs (a waxing moon - which is getting larger). Such ideas may seem scientifically laughable. But might there be something in them? Last week, U.S. surgeons reported that people undergoing heart surgery have a lower death rate if their operation is done when the moon is starting to wane. The study at Rhode Island Hospital followed 210 patients who'd undergone surgery between January 1996 and December 2011 to repair life-threatening tears in the lining of the aorta, a rare condition known as aortic dissection. Dr Frank Sellke, the lead researcher and chief cardiothoracic surgeon, says: 'We found the odds of dying following the procedure were greatly reduced during the waning full moon, and that length of stay was also reduced during the full moon.' Indeed, people who had the surgery during a full moon stayed in hospital for an average of ten days, compared with 14 for those who underwent it at other times in the lunar cycle, according to a report in the journal Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery. This kind of lunar influence - also known as the 'Transylvania effect' - has long caused rows among medical experts. Does the moon really affect our bodies, or is such evidence is merely the result of coincidences and statistical quirks? A report in April's European Journal of Preventive Cardiology seems to support the moon-believers. As with the Rhode Island study, it found that the waning moon just after a full moon may protect people's hearts. The researchers, from the Central Hospital of Augsburg, Germany, studied the records of 16,000 heart-attack victims, and also found significantly fewer attacks occurred in the three days after a new moon. Some experts believe this may be caused by the moon's gravitational pull affecting heart functions. When the moon is full, and at new moons (when the sun and moon are aligned), the gravitational pull of the moon and sun are combined, and gravity is thought to be at its strongest. The idea is that this may have the most beneficial effect on human circulation at or just after a full moon. Evidence for this effect has also been found in India by researchers at Vidyasagar University. They asked 80 students to do exercises every day for a month while having their heart rate, blood pressure and athletic performance monitored. The 'Transylvania effect': Some experts believe the moon's gravitational pull affects heart functions . The results suggested that at full moons, people's cardiovascular systems were working at their most efficient rates, reported the International Journal of Biometeorology last November. Some medics also believe that the moon's gravitational pull can affect the flow of fluid in the human body. If this is the case, then it should prompt kidney-stone trouble at times when the moon's pull is strongest - at full moons and new moons. One study, in the journal Emergency Medicine International, found that hospital admissions for kidney stones didn't vary according to lunar cycles. However, other research suggests the opposite. In 2011, the Urology Journal published evidence from a study of nearly 1,500 patients that renal colic - pain commonly caused by kidney stones - seemed to increase significantly at the time of the full moon. Furthermore, a study at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in 2008 found that emergency urological admissions did seem to be affected by lunar phases. 'Emergency urological admissions were higher on full-moon days,' said lead researcher Hasan Qazi in the journal Current Urology. 'The new moon had a calming effect.' The pull of gravity may also make a difference to other fluids in our bodies - even our brains - according to Dutch researchers. Their study of more than 5,400 patients in 2011 showed that emergency admissions of psychiatric patients rose during full- moon periods. The researchers, from Radboud University, Nijmegen, suggest this may be caused by the moon's gravity affecting the flow of fluids in the brain - and in individual brain cells - which in turn may alter people's mood and behaviour. Controversial findings: Results from this study suggest that at full moons, people's cardiovascular systems were working at their most efficient rates . The effect of the moon on patients' health has also been noted by GPs. In a study published in the doctors' newspaper Pulse, Dr Peter Perkins, a GP in Bournemouth, interviewed 79 general practitioners and found that emergency calls for all conditions increased by 3 per cent at full moon and dropped by 6 per cent during a new moon. Similar research at Leeds University has found that GP consultation rates rise by 3.6 per cent during a full moon. Many experts remain highly sceptical, however. Numerous studies have found no influence in areas where the moon was thought to have power. For example, the moon may have been worshipped in ancient times as the goddess of fertility and delivery, but there seems to be no link between its phases and the rates of childbirth. This was the conclusion of a study of 13,000 births by Brazil's University of Sao Paulo, published in the International Journal of Biometereology last July, which investigated whether this phenomenon existed. Some German scientists seem particularly keen to debunk the idea of lunar influence. Surveys in Germany show that more than one in ten people are convinced that the moon affects their health, and lunar calendars with recommendations for daily life have become increasingly popular there. Some people have claimed that the lunar phase may produce more beneficial outcomes in other surgery, such as hip replacements, but German statistical research so far has shown there's no link. But even if we accept that the moon has an effect, this may not be due only to the moon's gravitational pull, argue some scientists. Rather, the effect might be due to the way the moon's proximity distorts the Earth's magnetic field. However, sceptics say that such effects are tiny compared with our home environment, which is full of magnets. Perhaps lunar influence could also come down to something simpler than invisible forces. It might be caused by changes in natural levels of light. The full moon's light is up to 16 times greater than at other lunar phases. Researchers at University College London have discovered that the number of epileptic seizures, which are related to electrical activity in the brain, falls when the moon is at its brightest. 'These findings suggest that epileptic seizures are less likely to occur on brighter nights,' says Dr Sallie Baxendale from the Institute of Neurology, who led the study. She believes the hormone melatonin, secreted only at night and in the dark, might be implicated, although it is not clear how. So far, all these research efforts leave us with more tantalising questions than answers. And, as Dr Sellke, author of the latest research, has asked, even if we do prove that the moon has a medical influence, what should we do with that knowledge? While it may help some people with epilepsy to reduce their risk of fits on certain nights, it would cause widespread chaos if hospitals cancelled all surgical operations on nights when the lunar phase appeared statistically unhelpful. Anyone who suggested such a thing might be dismissed as moonstruck, or justifiably labelled a complete lunatic.","The idea that the moon affects our bodies has long caused controversy .

"As someone who loves ice cream, Gary Finch was disappointed when he was diagnosed with lactose intolerance. The retired banker from Warrington, Cheshire, developed the symptoms in 1998. He'd had a tummy bug on holiday in Thailand, but it kept flaring up, especially when he ate anything creamy. 'Whenever I had ice cream or  cheesecake I'd have terrible cramps and need to rush to the loo all night,' says Gary, 53. One in five people have had lactose intolerance at some time . His GP ran blood tests and diagnosed lactose intolerance - when the body is unable to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk. One in five people have had this condition at some time - it can be permanent or occur temporarily after a gut infection or surgery. Gary's GP thought it was due to the holiday gastroenteritis. It had apparently damaged the lining of the bowel, meaning it could no longer break down lactose. The advice was to build up his tolerance by eating only small portions of dairy products until he got used to them again, which could take three months. But it didn't work. Every month Gary would have another flare-up. And they were getting worse - by 2008, he was rushing to the loo up to eight times a day. It got so bad that on some days he simply wouldn't eat so his body had nothing to get rid of. Over six months, he lost a stone in weight. Colitis and lactose intolerance have many crossover symptoms, such as abdominal pain and tiredness . It was more than ten years after his symptoms had first appeared that he finally discovered the real cause of his troubles. Gary had spotted blood and mucus in his stools and his GP referred him to the Spire Cheshire Hospital, where he had an endoscopy - a telescopic examination of his bowel. The result showed that he had ulcerative colitis - an inflammatory condition of the large bowel that's linked to an over-active immune system and can be serious. Up to 120,000 Britons are thought to have this condition, yet experts warn the true number may be far higher, because symptoms can often be mistaken for food allergies, stress or lactose intolerance.It's easy to misdiagnose colitis as lactose intolerance because eating dairy can exacerbate both conditions. The number of people with ulcerative colitis  who will ultimately need surgery . 'It's not uncommon for treatment to be delayed if symptoms are blamed on more common conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or lactose intolerance,' says Dr Ian Shaw, consultant gastroenterologist and medical adviser to Crohn's and Colitis UK. Colitis and lactose intolerance have many crossover symptoms, such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain and tiredness. 'But importantly lactose intolerance does not cause bleeding,' says Dr Shaw. And diarrhoea caused by lactose intolerance should improve within a month or two. Gary's doctor, Dr Subramaniam Ramakrishnan, consultant gastroenterologist at Spire Cheshire Hospital and Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, says: 'If someone has changes in bowel habits lasting more than six weeks, they should see their GP to rule out serious conditions, including Crohn's, ulcerative colitis or bowel cancer, rather than assume dairy is the trigger. 'But as more common conditions such as lactose intolerance can mask Crohn's and colitis, diagnosis is often delayed. Gary may never have had lactose intolerance at all - those symptoms could have been caused by  early-stage colitis. 'It's crucial that ulcerative colitis is controlled with treatment. Having to rush to the toilet up to 20 times a day is unpleasant and disruptive. It is important to confirm that there is not something more serious going on . 'But uncontrolled inflammation of the large bowel over many years can lead to serious conditions, including perforation of the bowel, which is life-threatening. 'It can also lead to bowel cancer, as continued inflammation and healing allow abnormal growths to form.' Immediately after his ulcerative colitis diagnosis, Gary took a short course of steroids and anti-inflammatory medication, which got the condition under control. With his bowel in a more healthy state, he found he could tolerate small quantities of dairy products again. 'I'd have flare-ups every few months, but I was much better,' says Gary. However, in March 2012, tests revealed ulcers on his large bowel, caused by the years of uncontrolled inflammation. Gary was told he might eventually need surgery to remove the diseased colon, meaning he would need a colostomy bag. A sports lover, Gary couldn't bear the thought. Doctors decided to try to control the disease with medication to spare him from surgery. Dr Ramakrishnan increased the dose of the anti-inflammatory medication and added azathioprine, an immunosuppressant. Gary's bowel healed and gradually the bouts of diarrhoea became less frequent. 'Now that it's under control, I only need a low-dose medication of Asacol to reduce inflammation,' says Gary, who runs daily and is playing football again. 'I still have a bit of lactose intolerance, so am careful about eating creamy food.' But Dr Ramakrishnan says Gary's story should be seen as a cautionary tale for anyone who is suffering unexplained, long-standing digestive problems. 'When people believe they have lactose intolerance, it is important to confirm that there is not something more serious going on,' he says. 'When Gary was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, he'd had it for almost a decade. Patients who have blood in their stools or a persistent change in their bowel habit should always seek help.' Gary agrees: 'If I hadn't blamed lactose intolerance for so long, I might have got help sooner. A test seemed to confirm I was lactose intolerant, but I had another, much more serious problem, too.' crohnsandcolitis.org.uk;  0845 130 2233.","One in five people have had lactose intolerance at some time .

"By . Bianca London . The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have laid a wreath in memory of Welsh miners killed in the collieries saying the country owes them 'a debt of gratitude'. Charles and Camilla attended the Welsh National Miners Memorial in Senghenydd, in the Aber Valley, meeting relatives of those killed in the area’s biggest disaster. In 1913, the village’s colliery was rocked by a huge underground explosion claiming the lives of 439 miners and one rescuer. Remembering: The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall during a visit to the Welsh National Mining Memorial, Senghenydd, where they paid their respects to those who lost their lives in the coal mines . Roy Noble, patron of the village’s heritage committee, welcomed the couple to the monument’s 'hallowed ground', which also commemorates a similar disaster from 1901. The Prince and Duchess were shown tiles inlaid around the sculpted bronze memorial bearing the names of the victims, some as young as 14. As both intently studied those names, many from the same families, the Aber Valley Male Voice Choir sang the song 'Senghenydd', which asks 'where have all the young men gone?', concluding 'we will remember them'.

Wellwishers: Charles and Camilla spent a long time greeting crowds of villagers and taking posies of flowers presented by dozens of schoolchildren . Among the choir, 70-year-old Viv Pitten, who lives at the top of the valley, said the disaster was 'still raw' for the people of his generation. Later, as Charles toured the village’s Heritage Museum, he paid tribute to the courage of the miners, and to those who paid the ultimate price digging the vital coal that helped drive Britain’s industry. He said: 'My wife and I have so enjoyed this opportunity to meet you all and if I may say so to have a chance to pay our respects at the memorial. 'We just wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate all those who’ve been involved in ensuring such a marvellous memorial is there in memory of all those many people who died so tragically, not only in 1913, but in 1901. Tribute: As Charles toured the village's Heritage Museum, he paid tribute to the courage of the miners, and to those who paid the ultimate price digging the vital coal that helped drive Britain's industry . 'And in the fact you are commemorating so many other mining disasters which have afflicted so many other communities in this remarkable part of South Wales. 'I think we owe such an enormous debt of gratitude, respect and appreciation to those people - so many from the same families - who went underground and were courageous and determined enough to do so. 'Both of us are enormously proud to have this opportunity to be here.' Charles and Camilla, who had been due to visit the memorial’s unveiling on the centenary of the disaster in October last year, spent a long time greeting crowds of villagers and taking posies of flowers presented by dozens of schoolchildren. The couple met mother Helen Manship, and shared a playful moment with her one-year-old daughter Evie-Rae Manship, who seemed thoroughly bemused by the royal attention. Mrs Manship said the heir to the throne seemed in good spirits. She said: 'I told him I was a mum of three, and he said ""you’ve got your hands full then"" and then joked ""have they got permission to be off school?""' Hilary Barbrook, 74, lost two grandfathers in the 1913 disaster. She said: 'They brought my grandfather Hopkins James up, and he’s buried in the nearby cemetery. 'My other grandfather Charles Brown, they couldn’t find his body. Then 15 months after the explosion, they opened up that part of the mine and they found him and he was only recognisable from a ring he had on.' Tour: The Prince and Duchess were shown tiles inlaid around the sculpted bronze memorial bearing the names of the victims, some as young as 14 . Ms Barbrook, who now lives in Caerphilly at the bottom of the valley, said it was still 'very emotional'. She welcomed the royal visit and said: 'I think it’s very important for the recognition of what we’ve tried to do for all of Wales.' Charles and Camilla are four days into a five-day tour of Wales. The Duchess of Cornwall was later due to visit Usk, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Royal Horticultural Society’s Britain in Bloom competition and meeting local schoolchildren and community members. Separately, Charles was being shown around a 15th century Welsh farmhouse which is being restored by the Landmark Trust, of which the Prince is a patron. He was then due to continue on to Cricklehowell in Brecon Beacons National Park in Powys, to view the production process for a family-run organic apple juice maker.","Attended the Welsh National Miners Memorial in Senghenydd .

"By . Emma Innes . For two years, Britain’s fattest man was bed-bound, unable to sit up, wash himself or even go to the bathroom. Now, a team of surgeons, doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and carers have taken on the epic task of trying to save his life. At his biggest, Keith Martin, 43, weighed 70st and had a mega-obese BMI of 155 – the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9. Scroll down for video . Keith Martin, 43, weighed 70st and had a BMI of 155 meaning he was classed as mega-obese. Doctors told him he only had two years to live unless he lost weight . He had to be cared for full-time by his sister, Tina, and had not sat up for a year, or been out of his house for a decade. Doctors had given him just two years to live. As Mr Martin took on the enormous job of trying to rebuild his life, he was filmed for a Channel 5 documentary, Saving Britain’s 70-Stone Man, the first part of which will be aired tomorrow evening. He said: ‘Until I saw the film of myself I didn’t realise I was that big – it upset me that I had let myself get that big. ‘But, on the other hand, it helped me realise because I look at that and I think “I’m not going to be like that any more”.’ Mr Martin, who lives with Tina and his other sister, Sharon, who has special needs, started piling on the pounds after his mother’s death when he was a teenager. Mr Martin (pictured in a hoist in hospital) started to pile on the pounds as a teenager after his mother's death and got to the stage where he was eating 24 fried eggs for his breakfast each day . Mr Martin (pictured being taken to hospital for weight loss surgery) was unable to sit up or go to the bathroom. He did not leave his house for ten years . He says he blamed himself for her death as she stayed out of hospital to look after him because he was playing truant from school. He said: 'That's why I started eating - when anything upset me I'd eat more.' Eventually, it got to the stage where he Martin was consuming 10,000 calories a day - including a breakfast of 24 fried eggs each day. He had to lie on incontinence bed pads as he was unable to get out of bed to use the bathroom and a team of council funded carers had to visit him twice a day to bathe him and help look after his fragile skin. Mr Martin was cared for by his sister, Tina, but also needed £40,000 worth of council funded care every year. His carers visited him twice a day to help wash him and care for his fragile skin . Mr Martin was told he was too immobile to lose weight successfully without weight loss surgery but surgeons said he was so big he would die on the operating table unless he lost some weight before the operation . His care cost the council £40,000 a year. Mr Martin said: 'I am sick of being like this and of it causing so much trouble. I want to be like everyone else.’ He added: 'It took a while for me to realise what an idiot I was. By then it was almost too late.' His sister and carer, Tina, said: 'He is worried that he is not going to have a future. ‘The doctor says if he doesn’t lose the weight then in two years he could die. That scares him.' Mr Martin was told he would not be allowed weight loss surgery until he was able to stand up. He finally achieved this goal in July this year (pictured) Mr Martin’s huge bulk put his heart under enormous strain and caused his liver to become extremely enlarged. After being faced with the prospect that he did not have long to live, he decided to make drastic changes to his life. With the help of his sister, he cut his calorie intake to a healthy 2,000 a day and started eating more fruit, vegetables and fish. He said: 'I am eating more fish and chicken. If you told me five or ten years ago I would have laughed at you - my idea of a healthy diet was a plate of chips. ‘Now I shudder at the thought of some of the things I used to eat.' Despite . revolutionising his diet, doctors warned Mr Martin he would not be able . to lose enough weight to regain his health just by dieting because of . his immobility. Mr Martin (pictured as a teenager) says he started to pile on the pounds after his mother's death as he blamed himself for it . He was told weight loss surgery was his only hope of survival - but was so unwell that surgeons feared he would die on the table. They told him they would only operate if he lost enough weight to be able to stand up. Mr Martin undertook a strict . physiotherapy regime as his muscles were so wasted they would not be . able to support his bulk – he only had 50 per cent of the normal amount . of muscle in his arms and legs. He said: 'It's either this or dying and I ain't going to die now. 'I want to get a life back - I want to be like everyone else.' Mr Martin was cared for full-time by his sister, Tina (pictured), who helped him adopt a healthier diet . Mr Martin continued to follow his strict diet and stuck religiously to his physiotherapy. As a result, by January 2013 he had lost more than 20st and weighed 49.5st. However, surgeons at London’s Homerton Hospital would not consider him for surgery until he could stand. In . June this year, supported by a team of carers and physiotherapists, he . tried to stand up for the first time in two years but was devastated to . find his muscles were too weak. He sobbed: 'My legs won’t take the weight - I can’t get myself up.' Mr . Martin feared his chance of surgery had slipped away but his doctors . refused to give up on him and he was taken into hospital for a more . radical exercise regime. Mr Martin was devastated when he failed to stand up the first time he tried - he feared this meant he would never be able to have life-saving weight loss surgery . He said: 'I am sort of feeling numb but excited. I am nervous but excited, and stressed. ‘I will either come back a different person or I am not coming back at all. It scares the hell out of me to be honest.' Two specialist paramedics were . required to transport Mr Martin to the hospital where two normal size . beds had to be moved to make way for his extra-large one. Due . to his extreme size, Mr Martin’s hospital stay, and eventual surgery, . cost six times the usual amount – the procedure normally costs the NHS . about £8,000 but in Mr Martin’s case, the cost was £50,000. While in hospital, he was put on a 1,000 calorie a day, milk-only diet in an attempt to shrink his enlarged liver. Eventually, in July this year, he managed to stand with the help of a specialist obesity hoist. Mr Martin was eventually accepted for weight loss surgery but was warned that he could have a heart attack or stroke on the table. He was also told the surgery might have to be abandoned if there were complications . By this point, he had also lost 25st - and was given the go ahead for surgery. He said:  'Worst case scenario is that I go down and don’t come back up again.' His surgeon confirmed that there was a serious danger of Mr Martin suffering a heart attack or a stroke during surgery. He also explained that the surgery could have to be abandoned if complications arose. The outcome of Mr Martin’s surgery will be the subject of the second episode of Saving Britain’s 70-Stone Man, next week.","Keith Martin had a BMI of 155 and was classed as mega-obese .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Sophie Aldridge went to hospital complaining of back ache, doctors dismissed her with a dose of painkillers. Hours later, she was back in hospital – giving birth. The 20-year-old had no idea she was expecting as she didn’t put on weight, still wore her size-ten clothes and continued having regular periods throughout the pregnancy. She even kept going on nights out with friends up until 5lb 8oz son Thomas arrived. Surprise: Sophie Aldridge, 20, had no idea she was pregnant when she woke in the middle of the night with severe back ache. Her son Thomas was born just hours later . Miss Aldridge said: ‘It was a big shock to everyone when I suddenly arrived home with a baby. ‘When I gave birth I didn’t even have a nappy to my name, let alone clothes, pram, cot … I had nothing.’ Miss . Aldridge, who lives with her parents in Dover, Kent, had woken up in . the middle of the night with agonising back ache, but blamed it on . period pains. When her . condition deteriorated the next day, her mother took her  to hospital, . but doctors couldn’t  find anything wrong and sent her  away with drugs . to make her  more comfortable. Shortly . after arriving home, however, the pain became too much to bear and Miss . Aldridge was taken back to hospital in an ambulance. It was only then . that paramedics broke the news that she was pregnant and in labour – and . Thomas was born less than half an hour after she arrived at A&E. Slim: Miss Aldridge (in the red skirt) when she was eight months pregnant and (right) at seven months. Because she had no idea she was expecting, she continued to drink throughout her pregnancy . Miss . Aldridge, who works as a carer, said: ‘I was due to come on to my . period that day so I thought that must have been why I was having such . bad pains. ‘I know it might sound really stupid to some people but I  literally had no idea I was  pregnant – I didn’t have  any symptoms. ‘I . didn’t get morning sickness, I stayed wearing my size-ten clothes, I . had regular periods throughout the pregnancy and I didn’t have any . cravings. To give birth there and then like I did was absolutely . terrifying.’ Fortunately, friends and family rallied around to help the single mother cope with the unexpected arrival. She . said: ‘When I came home from hospital my friends and family had come . together and donated nearly everything Thomas and I needed, which was so . kind.’ 'Miracle': Miss Aldridge had thought her back pain was period pain - but then her waters broke and baby Thomas arrived half an hour later . Miss Aldridge had still been enjoying frequent nights out with . friends right up until Thomas’s arrival. She . said: ‘I was still going out and getting drunk with my friends while I . was pregnant – I had no idea I was pregnant, obviously. ‘I was still wearing crop-tops and mini skirts, I didn’t have a bump or anything.’ Her . pregnancy was discovered in November only after the crippling back ache . struck. Her worried mother called 111 for emergency advice and took her . daughter to William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, but doctors found . nothing wrong. Miss Aldridge said: ‘A doctor gave me some tablets and then just sent me home. ‘I . thought that obviously everything was fine and normal and that it must . have just been period pain – they wouldn’t have sent me home otherwise.’ Miss Aldridge said: 'I know it might sound really stupid to some people, but I literally had no idea I was pregnant - I didn't have any symptoms' Just hours after returning . home, however, the pain became too much to bear and her mother called . an ambulance to take her back to the hospital. In the ambulance, Miss . Aldridge’s waters broke and paramedics realised she was in labour. ‘The next thing I remember I was in hospital with a baby in my arms,’ she said. ‘Everything was just so quick I didn’t really have time to gauge what was happening. ‘I was only in labour for 30 minutes. ‘In a way I’m so glad it  all happened – I wouldn’t change Thomas for the  world now. I like to call him my little miracle.’ Unprepared: 'When I came home from hospital my friends and family had come together and donated nearly everything me and Thomas needed, which was so kind', said Miss Aldridge . The . phenomenon of undiagnosed pregnancy isn’t quite as rare as might be . expected. Studies have shown that  up to one in 600 mothers-to-be do not . realise they are pregnant until they give birth, or just before. It . is more likely to occur among menopausal women and younger, busy women . because they are not expecting to be pregnant and will not be looking . for the signs. It is not . uncommon for  pregnant women to experience some light bleeding – or . ‘spotting’ – especially in the first few months, which can allow them to . think they are still menstruating. Many don’t put on very much weight and won’t necessarily have a defined bump. Although the average woman puts on two stone, some gain as little as half a stone and can still fit into the same clothes.","Sophie Aldridge, 20, assumed her back ache was due to period pain .

"By . Martyn Halle . How it works: The new procedure could save lives . A machine that hoovers away blood clots in the brain could save thousands of stroke patients from death or serious disability. Clots are a leading cause of stroke – when the blood supply  is cut off to part of the brain – and need to be removed as soon as possible to restore oxygen supply to cells and prevent further damage. Usually intravenous drugs are used to break up the blockage. Now 20 UK hospitals are trialling the new procedure, known  as intra-arterial thrombectomy, which takes just 12 minutes. A tube is inserted into an artery via the groin, then travels to the brain to suck up the clot. It has already saved patients such as 60-year-old Stephen Williamson, who suffered a massive stroke on the golf course two months ago. He was found to have a 2in blood clot starving his brain of oxygen. ‘His was a very dramatic recovery,’ recalls Dr Norman McConachie,  a neuro-interventional radiologist at Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham, who says he has never before seen such a remarkable recovery from a stroke. ‘When he got him on to the operating table he was weak and couldn’t move the left-hand side of his body. But we pulled the clot out and almost instantly he gave us the thumbs-up with his previously paralysed hand.’ The recovery was particularly striking as the standard clot-busting drug treatment had failed to help Stephen. About 152,000 Britons suffer a stroke each year and there are two main types – those caused by clots and those due to burst blood vessels. For nearly two decades, doctors have been able to reach up into the brain through the groin and stop bleeding caused by burst blood vessels. But the use of such technology  to deal with a clot is more recent, and patients with clots in large blood vessels and arteries do less well than those with smaller clots. Now medics want to show the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that the ‘hoover’  is worth introducing on the NHS. Speed is crucial as there is an urgency to removing a clot, says Dr McConachie. ‘Millions of neurons a minute are being lost while the clot  is blocking the flow of blood to the brain. 'So every minute counts. We aim to treat patients within six hours of a stroke, but the target is three hours or even less – two if possible.’ A stroke team decides which patients qualify to have their brains ‘hoovered’ by performing a brain CT angiogram scan. The procedure works by inserting a catheter (a thin tube) up to the brain through the arterial system. A smaller catheter is fed through it, with a probe on the end that breaks up the clot into small pieces which are then hoovered down the larger tube. Dr McConachie says it is aimed  at removing clots from the top of the carotid artery running up from the neck, the middle cerebral artery feeding the top of the brain and the basilar artery at the back of the skull. Need for speed: When removing a blood clot, speed is crucial in order to avoid a stroke, and the intra-arterial thrombectomy takes just 12 minutes . ‘These are the ones with the largest clots that don’t respond at all well to intravenous drugs. They are often several inches thick and the drugs either don’t work or take too long to break up the clot.’ NICE accepts the technology works but claims it still doesn’t know enough about how patients fare. ‘This technology is well established in other European countries, but the UK has lagged behind and we are catching up,’ says Dr McConachie. Hundreds of patients are now being offered the hoover, either as part of the trial or separately like Stephen. He arrived at Nottingham’s City Hospital paralysed down one side but within  48 hours found the weakness and paralysis had almost completely gone. Dr McConachie is convinced that without the treatment, Stephen would have been left wheelchair-bound and severely disabled for the rest of his life. Instead, he was back on the golf course just weeks later. Stephen, a father of four from Chesterfield, has suffered no long-term effects. He says: ‘I have a friend who had a stroke seven years ago and she has not got her speech back and can’t move her arms and legs. ‘Yet for all intents and purposes I am the same as I was before, and I play golf to virtually the same standard. If I hadn’t had the procedure I would have been in hospital for six months trying to get my functions back and I would have had to have carers and be in a wheelchair. It’s a miracle, really.’","'Hoover machine' treatment for strokes now in UK hospitals .

"By . James Tozer . A great-grandmother was left screaming in agony on a hospital ward while a doctor played a computer game, an inquest was told. Relatives begged staff to ask him to make 81-year-old Sadie Gray more comfortable, but they refused, saying he was off duty. Mrs Gray had to wait 90 minutes before another doctor arrived to give her morphine. The pensioner, who had undergone bowel surgery, died less than three weeks later as a result of complications from the operation. Sarah Ann Gray, 81, was 'screaming in pain' and vomiting because her bowel perforated after an operation . A coroner ruled that while she had suffered poor nursing care, her death was ultimately down to what happened during surgery. But her family yesterday condemned a  ‘catalogue of errors’, including the failure of ward staff to ask the off-duty doctor to help. They are considering legal action. Details of Mrs Gray’s ordeal came on the day the Mail revealed that a whistleblower who exposed NHS failures had been cleared of wrongdoing – after a 13-year legal battle that cost the taxpayer £10 million. Ironically, Mrs Gray had chosen to avoid Tameside General Hospital near her home in Denton, Greater Manchester, because of concern over its treatment of elderly patients. Instead she was admitted to Manchester Royal Infirmary in December 2012 and underwent surgery for a perforated bowel. But she spent seven months in hospital, with her family facing ‘a constant battle’ to ensure she was well cared for. Finally, last June, she was prepared for discharge and underwent further surgery to insert a feeding tube, the inquest heard. But after returning to the ward, Mrs Gray began screaming in pain and vomiting, relatives told the hearing, becoming delirious and pleading with them to send an ambulance to the ward. Mrs Gray died a few weeks later of complications from the surgery at Manchester Royal Infirmary (pictured) Her son, Gary, 52, said he went to reception to ask for someone to prescribe her pain relief, but was told that the doctor sitting just outside the ward could not help. ‘There was a doctor playing on a computer in the corridor,’ he said. ‘The receptionist said he wasn’t on this morning. He was sat right outside the room. She was screaming in pain.’ Mrs Gray was finally given morphine, but even then the doctor did not examine her, her family told the inquest in Manchester. Tragically it emerged her bowel had again been perforated during the operation and she died on June 28. The hospital later gave the family a 41-page report showing lapses in nursing care, including pain management, nutrition and hydration, infection prevention and record-keeping in the months leading up to her death. Anne Woodward, lead nurse in surgery, told the inquest the report showed the hospital had taken the issue seriously. But Mrs Gray’s daughter, Susan Carter, told Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows she was convinced her mother ‘could be alive today’ if she had received better care. Mr Meadows ruled in a narrative verdict that Mrs Gray had died from multi-organ failure following complications after bowel surgery. But he added: ‘I can see there has been a number of failures in nursing care.’ A spokesman for Central Manchester University Hospitals Trust said: ‘Mrs Gray was given pain relief immediately after her procedure and a doctor was then called to provide a stronger painkiller and attended to Mrs Gray an hour and a half later. Another doctor who was present on the ward at the time was from a visiting speciality and not familiar with Mrs Gray.’","Sarah Ann Gray, 81, was 'screaming in pain' and vomiting .

"By . Jennifer Wiley . and Emma Innes . A student suffers from a rare condition which means she spends up to six hours a day picking at her face until it bleeds. Samantha Wake, 20, has dermatillomania - and dozens of scars across her face as a result. She said: ‘Sometimes I actually look like I’ve been in a car crash. Scroll down for video . Samantha Wake, 20, has permanent scarring on her face as a result of a rare condition which means she compulsively picks at her skin until it is raw and bleeding . ‘People ask me what on earth has happened to my face. The truth is I’ve done this to myself and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to stop doing it. ‘It’s a very real condition with very real consequences.’ Now, Ms Wake is revealing the full extent of her scarring for the first time to encourage doctors to learn more about the condition - and help sufferers know they aren’t alone. When she first developed symptoms, Ms Wake felt she wasn’t taken seriously by doctors. Ms Wake (pictured wearing heavy make-up) picks at her skin for up to six hours a day . Ms Wake (pictured as a child) said: 'People ask me what on earth has happened to my face. The truth is I've done this to myself and I don't think I'll ever be able to stop doing it' However, dermatillomania is thought to affect as many as one in 500 people in the UK and the vast majority are women. It can affect all ages but most people with dermatillomania are between 15 and 30 years old. Ms Wake will have scars for the rest of her life that will only get worse if she is unable to stop. And her temptation to repeat the cycle every day is so strong that she wishes her main trigger point - the mirror - never existed. Dermatillomania - or compulsive skin picking - is an impulse control disorder characterised by the uncontrollable desire to pick at one's skin. Some sufferers have the condition so severely they pick at their skin until it is damaged. Sufferers usually start by picking at their face before moving on to other parts of the body. The condition is often categorised as an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). It can lead to bleeding, bruising and infections. CSP will often be carried out after the individual has experienced a high level of tension which has caused an urge to carry out the behaviour. The skin picking is often accompanied by a feeling of relief or even pleasure due to the reduction in anxiety levels. However, once the damage has been done, those affected will often be left with a feeling of depression or hopelessness. Although the damage that is caused can be very severe, the gratification experienced can lead the individual to carry out CSP again and again. Treatment usually involves counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy. Source: Anxiety UK . If she detects even a minor blemish she will enter a trance-like state where she picks away for hours on end – sometimes even causing her to miss her animal management classes at Walford College. ‘It’s like my mind isn’t linked to my body,’ explained Ms Wake, from Telford, Shropshire. ‘If I detect even the tiniest flaw in my skin I will obsessively pick at it until I can’t feel any sign of it. ‘Unfortunately I’m always left with a much bigger mark - like a graze the size of a penny. ‘I know my face is covered in scars but I can’t tell the extent of it because there are so many scabs. My nose will be the worst and I have a dent in my left cheek. ‘Mornings and evenings are the worst. The first thing I do when I wake up is look in the mirror. If I let myself start picking I can’t think of anything else. ‘Hours can pass and I will miss my morning classes at college. At night I’ll leave my boyfriend on the settee watching a film while I disappear into the bathroom only to return raw and covered in sores. I’m trying my best to keep it under control but every day is a battle.’ The ritual is having a damaging impact on Ms Wake’s emotional health too, as afterwards she can be left feeling guilty and depressed. And that in turn means she is ashamed to be seen in public and often shies away from going out. She said: ‘I usually wear a thick layer of makeup when I leave the house but it doesn’t cover everything. When I talk to people I can see them looking at the marks instead of my eyes. ‘People ask me what’s wrong and I’m pretty honest about it now. I used to be embarrassed but now I see this is who I am. It is having a big impact though. ‘It’s made worse by anxiety and stress. If I’ve got a big event coming up like a holiday or a night out with friends I will desperately want my skin to be clear - but the pressure of that will make me pick more. So now I just don’t go out as much.’ The condition, related to obsessive compulsive disorder, is thought to be caused by anxiety and has similar traits to trichotillomania - where sufferers pull out their hair to calm their nerves. Ms Wake says doctors did not initially take her seriously when she told them about her condition . Ms Wake first started picking at her face at the age of 14 when she developed some minor acne. She said: ‘Even then I would pick obsessively at my spots but it was more like normal teenage picking. I went on tablets and the acne cleared up by the time I was 16, but the picking continued. ‘It got worse and worse and finally when I was 18 I decided to see a doctor. I felt like a freak. ‘At first no one would take me seriously. I remember leaving one appointment feeling so alone - like I must be the only person in the world doing this. Ms Wake (pictured as a child) has had cognitive behavioural therapy but it did not cure her of the condition . ‘It was only when my mum got involved that I was sent to have cognitive behavioural therapy. It helped me recognise some of the triggers and we talked about ways I could control my urges, like distracting myself by playing a game on my phone. My worst trigger is simply looking in the mirror. I wish mirrors didn’t exist.’ Some people with dermatillomania feel the urge to pick at their legs or arms, but Ms Wake’s focus has always been her face. She said: ‘For me, my focal point is my nose. For about two years now my nose hasn’t healed. It will scab over and I will pull that off. ‘I’ve been given ointment and tablets to stave off skin infections.’ Ms Wake, who plans to one day work at a zoo, added: ‘I want other people like me to know they aren’t alone. I’ve recently connected with other sufferers on the internet and it feels amazing to know there are people out there like me. ‘I want people to realise this condition is real and I’m not just some person with horrible spots or some skin disease. ‘And I hope more effort is put into researching the condition so maybe one day there will be a cure, or at least doctors have more understanding about it. ‘But I’ve decided I won’t let it beat me. I have a really supportive family and a lovely boyfriend. I will keep a smile on my face and try harder every day to pick a bit less.’","Samantha Wake, 20, has dermatillomania - or compulsive skin picking .

"By . Nell Mcandrew . Today 35,000 runners will line up at the start of the London Marathon. And I can guarantee that for most of them, the hardest road won’t be the one ahead (and that won’t be easy) but the one that got them there. Training to run 26½ miles is no mean feat. I should know. In 2012,  I achieved a personal best time of two hours 54 minutes – quite an accomplishment considering that I started as a keen amateur jogger a decade ago, in my early 30s. I’m not running this year and last year I missed the big race as I’d just given birth to my daughter, Anya. And as a busy mother of two – my son Devon is seven – fitting in exercise can be a squeeze. But I’m already training to run the marathon again next year. Nell McAndrew is already training for next year's London Marathon. Here she tells readers how to get fit for the big day, while smiling at the same time . Fortunately we now know that endless long runs are not the best way to prepare for a marathon. Research shows that short bursts of intense exercise – known as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) – are a better way to get in shape for endurance running than pounding the pavements or treadmill for hours. A long weekly run of 5km is still a priority, but it’s preferable to split the session into a series of shorter, pacier jogs with rests. Of course, if you love to run, you don’t have to give up. Instead, intersperse a 40-minute jog or brisk walk with these exercises, all of which can be done using improvised equipment – such as a log, fence or park bench. Each takes just a minute or so, so the whole thing feels fresh. Did I mention it’s fun? Pushing yourself to the limit can be hard – but all the leaping, hopping and bouncing makes me break out in a huge grin. Athletes on the Mall after finishing the marathon. Today, more than 35,000 runners will fill London's streets . THE PROGRAMME . If you’re training from scratch – whether for a 5k fun run or a full marathon – take at least 12 weeks to prepare. Aim . for three or more sessions a week. At least two should be HIIT . sessions, in which you run or walk briskly for five minutes, followed by . one HIIT exercise – done quickly, aiming to take not much more than . three minutes, with no rests between sets – and then repeat. The . whole routine will take about 50 minutes. The focus is on leg . exercises, although the upper body isn’t neglected – arms matter for a . good running technique. If you’re pushed for time, jog for five minutes, . then just do the exercises. Reserve . one session a week for longer runs. Instead of 5km in one go, try a . kilometre at your best pace followed by a two to three-minute rest, then . repeat five times. BOX JUMPS . WHY: Jumping over a tree trunk might sound like a game, but it uses almost every muscle in the body. If you can’t find a fallen  tree, try jumping up on to a  park bench, or start small by  using the front door step – but step down carefully so as to protect the ankle. Jumping over a tree trunk uses almost every muscle in your body . HOW: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, close to the obstacle you think you can either completely jump over or jump up on to. Squat so your thighs are almost at right angles to your calves. Use your arms to start momentum, swinging them forward then back, and push off as hard as you can with both feet to propel yourself over/on to the ‘box’. Try to land as quietly as you can. Either step down or turn around and repeat. DO: 3 sets of 15 to 20 . BUNNY HOPS . WHY: Another one  that might feel a bit silly, in a good way. You will need a bench without a back – or that trusty log, if you can find one. This couldn’t be simpler but is a fantastic all-over body workout, and rather exhausting when you do a lot of them! Nell McAndrew illustrates the bunny hops which is a 'rather exhausting' all-body workout . HOW: Stand on one side of the bench, bending  over with your hands  on it, with your knees slightly bent. Jump both legs over the bench together.  Land on the other side. That’s one rep. Try to keep your  weight over your chest  so your feet can land light and springy each time. Focus on keeping your abdominals pulled  in throughout. DO: 3 sets of 30 to 50 . TRICEP DIPS . WHY: Dips work the backs of the arms and will help tone them up. A bench  or that trusty log is needed for this one. Tricep dips: Work the backs of the arms and will hope tone them up . HOW: Sit up straight on the  long edge of the bench or log, legs slightly extended, feet flat on the ground. Place your hands palms down, fingertips just curled over the edge, on both sides of the bench just outside your hips. Without moving your feet, bring your bottom forward, off the bench. Steadily lower yourself. When your elbows form  90-degree angles, push yourself back up to starting position. If you want to make this easier, bring your feet closer to your body. DO: 3 sets of 10 . PRESS-UPS . WHY: To keep your core strong. When you are struggling in a run and you want to sprint to the finish, your upper body will help you do this. HOW:  On the ground in plank position, set your hands at a distance slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Angle your hand in a way that feels comfortable. Press-ups: To keep your core strong. When you are struggling in a run and you want to spring to the finish your upper body will help you do this . The wider apart your feet, the more stable you’ll be. If it’s too difficult, you can rest on your knees. Your bottom shouldn’t be sticking way up in the air or sagging. You should be looking slightly forward not down – your chin should touch the floor first. At the top of a push-up, your arms should be straight. Steadily lower your body until your elbows are at a  90-degree angle. At the lowest point, pause slightly then push fast and with energy back up to the start. DO: 3 sets of 10 . ONE LEG SPLIT SQUATS . WHY: The fallen log will again become your ‘gym bench’ – and this move is a  great way to work the hip flexors, bottom and backs of legs, and improve balance. HOW: Stand about 3ft from the bench,  facing away from it, feet shoulder width apart, hands on hips. One leg split squats: This move is a great way to work the hip flexors, bottom and backs of legs . Move one foot back so that your toe is resting on the bench. Your other foot should be stationary, a little in front of  your body – keep your head up to stay balanced. Make sure your back is straight and chest proud. Inhale, slowly lower your leg until your thigh is parallel to the floor. Your knee should be over your toes. Leading with the chest and hips, elevate your leg back to the start as you exhale. Halfway through, switch legs. DO: 3 sets of 10 to 20 . SUSPENDED SINGLE LEG SQUATS . WHY: This targets the thighs, but also the upper body and core. You need a suspension trainer – an adjustable nylon strap with hand grips. You can get a simple one for about £60. HOW: Lasso suspension trainer around fence or tree (strong enough to partly support your weight) so straps are running upward at slightly more than 45 degrees. Suspended single leg squats: This targets the thighs, but also the upper body and core. You need a suspension trainer ¿ an adjustable nylon strap with hand grips . Hold handles with a light grip, somewhere between horizontal and vertical. Feet should be about shoulder-width apart. Lift a leg  up, pointed in front of the body. Maintain alignment and distribute weight evenly through the middle of the grounded foot. Inhale and squat on one leg (keeping opposite leg from the floor), until squatting leg is parallel to the ground. Push up to the start and repeat. Switch legs halfway through set. DO: 1 set of 10 to 2 . SPRINTERVALS . For sprint intervals, you should aim to run as fast as you can for between 15 and 30 seconds, then slow down to a very gentle jog for a minute, and repeat. The first couple of times, you might . feel exhausted after about four or five intervals, but aim to build up . to eight sprints. Push yourself hard. The next time you go out on a . steady run you will be amazed how you feel much more comfortable in your . usual pace. The fitter you become, the faster you will recover. Sprintervals: You should aim to run as fast as you can for 15-30 seconds .","Journalist Nell McAndrew has began training for the 2015 London marathon .

"By . Fiona Macrae . It is a practice loved by celebrity mothers such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Sienna Miller. And according to a study, taking up yoga in pregnancy can ease stress – and reduce women's fear of childbirth. The first research of its kind found that a single yoga class cut anxiety in mothers-to-be by a third. Their levels of stress hormones fell and after two months of classes, the women said they were less scared about giving birth. Experts have now called on the NHS to provide free classes for pregnant women. Researchers found taking up yoga in pregnancy can ease stress and reduce women's fear of childbirth (file picture) Professor John Aplin, who specialises in reproductive biomedicine, even suggested yoga could help women cope with the pain of childbirth and reduce the number of emergency C-sections. He added: 'Perhaps we should be looking at providing yoga classes on the NHS. 'It would be relatively cheap to implement, could help mothers and their children be healthier, as well as reducing the costs of longer-term healthcare.' Yoga is popular with mothers-to-be and is often recommended by doctors and midwives, but until now no one had studied whether it is actually beneficial. The Manchester University researchers looked at two groups of women who were 22 weeks pregnant. Half did a weekly yoga class for two months and the other half attended antenatal classes. The yoga sessions were adapted for pregnancy and included relaxation techniques, as well as exercises to strengthen the body and ease pain. There were concerns that the weekly focus on childbirth in classes might actually make women more nervous. But a single yoga class cut the amount of anxiety the women felt by a third. The Manchester University researchers looked at two groups of women who were 22 weeks pregnant (file picture) Stress levels after the session were even lower than when relaxing at home, according to the study published in the journal Depression and Anxiety. And many of the women credited the techniques with keeping them calm and making the birth easier. Lead researcher Dr James Newham, who is now based at Newcastle University, said: 'We have long believed that it works but no research has been done to back up the theory. 'We have now gone some way to prove that it can help. It was no small effect. This has the potential to really help mothers who are feeling anxious about their pregnancy.' Jacqui Clinton from baby charity Tommy's, which funded the study, said: 'We already know that pregnancy yoga can help improve physical health and strength on the run up to having a baby, and this new evidence shows it may have important benefits for women's emotional health too.' The NHS advises pregnant women to stay active to help cope with labour. But a Department of Health spokesman said that the decision to run free yoga classes would need to be taken by individual hospital trusts.","First research of its kind found a single yoga class cut anxiety .

The fragile newborn, pictured right with her father Alan Coultas, is one of the youngest baby's to be born in Scotland having arrived at 24 weeks - the legal threshold for an abortion . But today the tiny 10-week-old has reached another milestone, her family feared she might not see, as mother Claire feeds her with a bottle . Emily, known as the 'little miracle', has been fed with a bottle by her mother Claire Cressey for the first time, after her family prayed she would pull through. Ms Cressey, 34, shared the moment she and her family feared might never come on social media. She said: 'It was the most beautiful moment, most mothers take that for granted, even get fed-up with doing it, not me. 'To see her take a bottle was wonderful, I'm so grateful for this time, so precious, when you fight to keep your baby alive for so long you often overlook these simple kind of moments, just like we did her jabs. 'To hold Emily with a bottle, her tubes seemed to vanish and the moment became real, gazing down at my baby watching her feed felt so right and I'm so thankful at the same time.' Emily was born weighing little more than half-a-bag of sugar. A medical team from Edinburgh . transported Ms Cressey from her home in Coldstream to ensure experts . were on hand to give Emily the help necessary to survive beyond birth. She . fought to stay alive, first on a ventilator, then by using a continuous . positive airway pressure machine, necessary to help her lungs develop . until they could function on their own.

"By . John Naish . Catherine De La Rosa, 54, was just 5ft tall but weighed 23st . Catherine . De La Rosa was nervous about having weight-loss surgery, but having . been assured by doctors that it was straightforward and safe, she . decided to give it a try. The 54-year-old grandmother was just 5ft . tall but weighed 23st, giving her a body mass index (BMI) of 52, making . her 'super-obese'. She had tried to lose weight with various diets . but nothing worked long term. Her size restricted her movement and made . her deeply depressed. Doctors at Leicester Royal Infirmary were . encouraging, however, explaining that inserting a gastric balloon would . be the answer. The balloon would partly fill her stomach, making her . feel fuller quicker, restricting her desire and ability to eat. Catherine was convinced, says her son Keiron, that finally this might help her lead a normal, healthy life. She had the surgery in June 2012. Four  days later she was dead, having suffered traumatic blood poisoning. At . an inquest last September, a Leicester City coroner heard that the . balloon had perforated her stomach, allowing toxic fluids to leak into . her bloodstream. Mrs De La Rosa's case is the latest in a series of . fatalities and injuries following NHS weight-loss surgery that have . recently come to light. The toll includes two deaths following gastric . bypass surgery in 2011 and 2012 at the Whittington Hospital, London, . where a surgeon has been suspended pending the results of an . investigation. According to the NHS Information Centre, demand for . weight-loss operations is rising rapidly. In 2006, there were 858 . procedures, rising tenfold to 8,794 in 2011. To be eligible for . surgery on the NHS, people must have a BMI over 40, or a BMI between 35 . and 40 but also suffer one or more obesity-related diseases, such as . diabetes. Imperial College London estimated last year that as many as . two million people in England are eligible for the surgery. And NHS . hospitals are gearing up to cope. For example, earlier this year the . University Hospital of North Staffordshire announced plans to double the . number of weight-loss operations and appointed a third obesity surgeon . to keep pace with what it calls 'the flood of morbidly-obese patients' requiring surgery. But there are concerns that patients aren't being told the whole story about the risks of such surgery. Furthermore, . there is no precise record of how many problems have occurred with . obesity operations, nor how many 'revision' surgical procedures are . being performed to correct weight-loss operations that went wrong. This . is even though revision surgery is known to be the riskiest of all such . ops because it involves the highly intricate task of repairing previous . surgery. She had a BMI of 52, making her 'super-obese', but hadn't managed to lose weight with various diets . Kieron, 32, recalls how his mother became 'frustrated and . depressed' that her attempts to lose weight failed. With her size at . risk of damaging her health, doctors said surgery was the only way . forward. Catherine, who lived in Gibraltar, had the surgery . performed in the UK under reciprocal health arrangements. 'Before the . op, we went to Leicester to speak to the doctors about it,' says Kieron. 'The surgeon said there would not be any problems so long as she kept . trying to diet and thus kept her weight stable.' Catherine's daughter Stacey, 22, was with her mother at the hospital for the operation. 'Afterwards, . my sister rang to say that the doctors felt everything had gone well,' says Kieron. 'The next day, though, she rang again to say that Mum was . complaining of pain and had begun to vomit - though the doctors had . reassured her that this was a normal reaction. 'I was worried. She was never one to complain, so if Mum was complaining about pain, then she'd really be in pain.' The number of years since the first bariatric surgery was performed . The . following day the vomiting got worse. The next morning the family was . told she'd be sent for a scan - but she died later that day. 'The doctors said something had gone wrong and that Mum had developed blood poisoning and had gone into cardiac arrest.' Figures . from the National Bariatric Surgery Registry suggest serious . complications occur in only 2.6 per cent of cases. Three 'post-operative . in-hospital' deaths occurred in Britain in 2013 as a result of . weight-loss surgery, according to the registry, to which weight-loss . surgeons submit their own results voluntarily. But an authoritative . British study in 2012 put the risks much higher. It found that one in . ten of these operations results in significant problems, and that at . least 29 deaths had occurred over a three-year period. The inquiry by . the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death . (NCEPOD) found that one-third of patients had inadequate post-surgical . care and monitoring. Surgeons contributing to the National Bariatric . Surgery Registry admit there is no good data to show how many ops have . to be done again because the patient has become very ill. These revision . operations carry the highest risk of death and long-term sickness. Bertie . Lee, who led the NCEPOD report and works as a malpractice lawyer, . defending hospitals, warns: 'I have seen too many cases of doctors being . caught out by the significant surgical challenges posed by patients . with obesity.' Often, he says, the difficulties are worsened by . 'lack of thoughtful pre-operative assessment and  the failure to do . careful post-operative follow-up'. Follow-up needs to be long-term. The report's findings show that many deaths related to bariatric surgery . can occur three or more years after the operation. Her son Kieron, 32, recalls how she became 'frustrated and depressed' that her attempts to slim failed . Two of the deaths . following gastric surgery involved the Whittington Hospital, which is . still conducting a long-running investigation involving the deaths of at . least two women. In December 2012, it suspended a surgeon following the . death of Jane White, a mother-of-three. Mrs White, 39, from Romford, . Essex, died following weight-loss surgery in September 2012. An inquest . in June last year heard she died of 'multiple organ dysfunction due to . complications', little over a week after her gastric bypass operation. Mrs White developed stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhoea two days after . being discharged from hospital. A revision operation to discover and . remedy the causes of her problems days later was 'inadequately . performed', the coroner said. In 2011, an inquest heard how Kim . Blake, 33, a mother-of-one from North London, died from malnutrition . caused by complications following gastric bypass surgery at the same . hospital. Ms Blake, who weighed 20st, had the initial operation in . January 2010. It passed without complications but she could not keep any . food down afterwards. Her weight plunged to 10st in ten months. She died in December 2010, before an operation to reverse the procedure could be done. So . are these just exceptional cases? The fact is that many NHS hospitals . are unprepared for dealing with weight-loss operations that go wrong. Last . January, researchers from King's College Hospital, London, warned in . the respected World Journal of Emergency Surgery: 'Currently, there are . no comprehensive guidelines for managing acute [emergency] cases of . bariatric surgery. 'The on-call general surgical and . anaesthetic/critical care teams are increasingly facing such clinical . scenarios with no standard plan of management.' New guidelines are . being put in place for 'driving up standards' on follow-up care and . monitoring after weight-loss surgery, according to Richard Welbourn, the . president of the weight-loss surgeons' professional organisation, the . British Obesity & Metabolic Surgery Society. For Keiron De La . Rosa, his mission continues to find out exactly what went wrong with his . mother's care. 'I'm still struggling to come to terms with the fact . that she is gone,' he says. 'I need answers about whether the hospital . staff really did everything in their power to help Mum after the . surgery.' He has instructed solicitors Irwin Mitchell to press . managers at the Leicester Royal Infirmary to give a full and open . explanation of what went wrong. John Jameson, the clinical director for surgery at Leicester's hospitals, says changes have been made since her death. 'Mrs . De La Rosa suffered a rare but very serious complication of her . surgery. We have carried out an investigation into her care and it found . that staff failed to act quickly enough when she showed signs of . deterioration.' Clearly, much more needs to be done to create proper safety nets for people whose weight-loss surgery goes wrong. As . Tam Fry, a spokesman for the British Obesity Foundation, says: 'There . is a false allure in weight-loss surgery as an ""easy"" answer. 'But . weight-loss surgery is also a totally false economy when misused. People . who imagine that it involves just a simple operation live in cloud . cuckoo-land.'","Obese Catherine De La Rosa, 54, from Leicester, weighed 23 stone .

Motes, whose other siblings Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, . 48, are also movie actors, said: ‘It makes me feel incredibly hurt and . very sad. ‘When you’re in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it’s intimidating. Not too close: Julia, pictured, outshone her younger sister Nancy, who made complaints about the Oscar winner in August . ‘I . think that growing up as Pretty Woman’s little sister has definitely . made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside. A lot . of my life I felt judged for my weight.’ Miss . Motes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when Miss . Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as call girl Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman. The actress, who had won a Golden . Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second . for Pretty Woman. Miss Motes, who described herself as an ‘awkward’ child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of . her ‘very pretty and very popular’ sister.

"By . Katy Winter . Student India Barnes, 21, began . pulling her hair at the age of eleven and by the time she was sixteen . had just under half an inch of hair left at the front of her hairline. Now in her second year of a dance degree at Chester University, India still does not know what caused her to start pulling. India's compulsion began between the ages of eleven and twelve, despite . being happy at home and at school. When India Barnes was 16 (left) she had just half an inch of hair left at her hairline, but now is undergoing CBT, and at 21, (right) wears a hair piece and is trying to get to the bottom of why she pulls her hair . ‘As . a teenager, dance took over my life,’ India says, ‘and I never pulled . when I was dancing. The problem was I pulled so much hair when I wasn’t . practising that it became increasingly difficult to hide what I was . doing despite wearing my hair up, tightly scraped back, covered with a . head band at the front and with a massive flower balanced on top of my . bun – in all, managing to look like a textbook off-duty ballet dancer . despite the damage I was doing. I think people just accepted it was my . look.’ She . has now started a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) course, where her . therapist is currently helping her to explore what sparks the desire . to pull. And India is not alone. Three per cent of the population will suffer at . some point in their lives from trichotillomania, the compulsive urge to pull out one's own hair, yet the vast . majority of us have never even heard of it, partly due to its secretive . nature. To raise . awareness of trichotillomania (TTM), hair loss specialist Lucinda Ellery . has teamed up with charity Trichotillomania Learning Centre (TLC) and . launched National No-Pulling Week. The majority of TTM pullers do so to help them cope with anxiety and other difficult emotions. It is often sub-conscious act, which makes it even harder to stop. And what can start as a relatively harmless habit can escalate into a compulsion, resulting in a complete loss of hair. And it’s not just hair that sufferers pull at. The control impulse disorder can take many forms, including eyelash plucking, skin picking and nail biting. Sufferers not only have to bear the physical consequences of pulling, but the emotional side too, which often results in cripplingly low self-esteem. - 110 million people suffer from TTM worldwide . - 840,000 women in UK suffer from TTM . - Less than 10% of women seek treatment . - The majority of TTM sufferers (80%) pull hair . - 47% pull their eyelashes, 44% eyebrows and 24% other hair . - Half report pulling is worse when under stress . Sam Faiers, star of the hit UK TV series, The Only Way Is Essex, and Olivia Munn, US actress and star of The Newsroom have both admitted to pulling at their eyelashes. In 2012 Sam told The Sun: 'It is hard to explain. I do it without thinking. I do it when I am nervous or bored or even when I am asleep. I don’t even realise I am doing it.' Natalie Blyth, 32, a nurse from Kent, now wears a wig to cover the bald patch caused by her hair pulling, which began as a harmless hair twiddling habit. Sam Faiers, star of The Only Way Is Essex, left, and Olivia Munn, right, of The Newsroom have both admitted to pulling at their eyelashes . It all started during a stressful time at school when she was around 14 years old.. ‘I felt I had a lot of pressure to do well, and it was during this time I noticed I started to play with my hair a lot, twisting it round my fingers to help deal with any feelings of anxiety I had,' Natalie explains. ‘After some time, my habit moved on from twiddling my hair, and I started to pull. This began with one hair here and there, but gradually over time my pulling was getting out of control. ‘I knew what I was doing was wrong but it made me feel so relaxed that I couldn't stop. It got to a point I was pulling my hair out so much that I even made my head bleed’ Natalie says. She lost her early twenties to the condition as ittook hold of her life and she hid herself away, often spending time alone in her room and crying herself to sleep every night. Her TTM caused Natalie to loose her sense of identity and femininity, which led to her spiralling into depression. Natalie tried to hide her condition (left) which led to her isolating herself and becoming depressed, but now (right) wears a wig and feels more confident . ‘I used to be really ashamed of what I did and was too scared to tell anyone. My mum used to find large clumps of hair all over the floor and I had to pretend that it was from my brush. ‘I would cry myself to sleep every night I lost all my confidence and I stopped going out. I felt like I had no life. ‘I used to think to myself why am I doing this, I must be some kind of freak. I thought to myself why should I be upset? I did this to myself. Nobody else was to blame’ she explains. Natalie says that in 2004 she reached rock bottom and decided to take charge of her condition, visiting TTM specialist Lucinda who fitted her with her signature Intralace system which is attached to the head and the hair is weaved through the colour blended lace to look as natural as possible. Lucinda says of the condition: 'So many young women are affected by TTM – but no one talks about it. By showing how common it is reaches out to women suffering out there. ‘I have thousands and thousands of TTM clients spanning across my UK and LA studios and the aim for International No-Pulling Week has always been to help raise awareness and offer solutions for sufferers. I want to stop women feeling alone.’","Trichotillomania is a compulsive urge to pull out your own hair .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . The family of Nora Daly claim she was sent home from hospital with a collapsed lung, four cracked ribs and a broken collarbone after doctors failed to investigate her properly after a falll . A pensioner was sent home from hospital with a collapsed lung, four cracked ribs and a broken collarbone after medical staff failed to investigate her properly. Nora Daly was rushed to A&E at the Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London, after paramedics found her screaming in pain on the floor after she'd had a fall at home. But her outraged family say she was given no X-rays or blood tests and sent home still in agony just hours later. The true extent of her serious injuries only emerged the next day when she was taken to the Royal Free Hospital in nearby Hampstead. Her furious daughter, Louise Daly, said: 'Is this how we treat our most vulnerable people? 'You hear horror stories about the NHS all the time. 'But it still blows your mind when your loved ones are the victims of this kind of incompetence.' The hospital has now apologised for the errors and launched an urgent investigation into Mrs Daly's care. Her daughter claims she went to see her mother at the hospital and was 'stunned' she hadn't been properly investigated. 'I went to pick her up from the Whittington to take her home and was surprised to find they didn't X-ray her,' she said. 'My parents didn't seem to have been given much information, so I assumed it must just be bruising. 'But that evening mum was still in a lot of pain and couldn't even lie down to sleep.' 'The following day I stepped out to run some errands and when I came back, one of mum's friends visiting her had called the ambulance because she was struggling to even breathe. This time Mrs Daly, of Islington, north London, was X-rayed at the Royal Free's A&E department. Shocked medical staff found that the pensioner had suffered four cracked ribs, a broken collarbone and a collapsed lung. Doctors also discovered she had a pre-existing pneumonia infection and admitted her for treatment. Mrs Daly was rushed to A&E at the Whittington Hospital (pictured) in Archway, north London, after paramedics found her screaming in pain on the floor at home . Miss Daly says the huge gulf in treatment and care between the two NHS A&E departmentsleft  her 'shocked'. She said: 'My mother's recovering from a stroke, fighting pneumonia and is old and frail - and they pushed her out the door without the most basic care.' A Whittington Hospital spokesman said: 'We are deeply sorry to hear about Mrs Daly’s experience. 'We are taking the concerns raised extremely seriously and have launched an investigation into the care that Mrs Daly received whilst in our emergency department.'","Nora Daly was rushed to the Whittington Hospital, north London, after a fall .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tests show a specific type of cocoa is packed with antioxidants thought to prevent brain disease . A nightly cup of cocoa could help stave off Alzheimer’s, scientists claim. Tests showed that a specific type of cocoa stops clumps of proteins from building up in the brain and damaging nerve cells – causing the disease to progress. Lavado cocoa is full of polyphenols, antioxidants which are also found in fruit and vegetables, with past studies suggesting that they prevent degenerative brain diseases. The team also tested the effects of extracts of Dutched and Natural cocoa, but Lavado, which has the highest levels of polyphenols, was found to be most effective at combatting the build up of harmful proteins. The findings are published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. The study by scientists at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York looked at synapses - the gaps between nerve cells. Because loss of synaptic function may have a greater role in memory loss . than the loss of nerve cells, rescue of synaptic function may serve as a . more reliable target for an effective Alzheimer's disease drug, said study leader professor Giulio Maria Pasinetti. Within . healthy nerve pathways, each nerve cell sends an electric pulse down . which releases chemicals called neurotransmitters that float across the . gap and pass on messages. However, in brains with degenerative . diseases like Alzheimer's, groups of harmful proteins attach to each . other and can fill in the gaps between nerve cells, disrupting memory . circuits and other normal brain functions. Dr Pasinetti, of Mount Sinai Hospital in  New York, suggested Lavado could eventually be made into a dietary supplement to prevent the disease. She said: 'We believe our results have broad implications for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.' Each cocoa type was evaluated for its ability to reduce the formation of harmful proteins. Lavado extract, which has the highest polyphenol content and anti-inflammatory activity among the three, was also the most effective in combatting the formation of sticky clumps in the brain and and reversing nerve cell damage. He said turning cocoa-based Lavado into a dietary supplement may provide a safe, inexpensive and easily accessible means to prevent Alzheimer's disease, even in its earliest stages.","Stops clumps of proteins from building up and damaging nerve cells .

"By . Emma Innes . A new female orgasm drug could soon be available after successful trials. Tefina, a ‘use-as-required’ nasal gel, was found to be safe and effective, its developers say. The product contains the sex hormone  testosterone, low levels of which have been linked with poor libido. A new female orgasm drug could soon be available after tests showed it was both safe and effective. Image shows Meg Ryan faking an orgasm in the film When Harry Met Sally . As a result, the manufacturer of this new treatment, Trimel Pharmaceuticals Corporation, now plans to work towards bringing it to the market. The gel is designed to be used for the treatment of Female Orgasmic Disorder, which is characterised by difficulty reaching orgasm and distress as a result of this difficulty. During trials, 253 women with the condition in the U.S., Canada and Australia were each given one of three different doses of the drug - or a placebo. They received treatment for 84 days and the researchers hoped to establish whether the treatment increased the frequency of orgasms. They also hoped to discover whether the drug caused any side effects. The researchers discovered that patients given the drug had an average of 2.3 orgasms during the trial period while the placebo group only had 1.7. They also claim the patients did not suffer any adverse side effects as a result of using the gel. Tefina is a testosterone nasal gel which is design for use by women who struggle to reach orgasm (file picture) ‘Female Orgasmic Disorder is the second most prevalent sexual disorder affecting women,' said Dr Sheryl Kingsberg, the U.S. principal investigator for the Tefina Phase II clinical trial. ‘Approximately one in five women report difficulty with orgasm and one quarter of these show marked distress, a key criterion in a clinical diagnosis. ‘Currently, there are no approved pharmacological treatment options, leaving an unmet need that Tefina hopes to remedy,' added Dr Kingsberg, who is also professor of reproductive biology and psychiatry at Case Western Reserve . University in Cleveland, Ohio. Tom Rossi, Trimel President and CEO, added: ‘These results mark an important milestone in the development of Tefina. ‘They provide further evidence that Tefina could represent an important treatment option for the many women who suffer from this disorder.'","The drug, which is called Tefina, is a 'use-as-required' testosterone nasal gel .

"By . Emma Innes . The U.S. has seen an alarming rise in the number of under 65s needing knee replacements and the UK is expected to follow suit . The number of younger people needing knee replacements is expected to rise because of soaring obesity rates, a study suggests. An alarming rise in under 65s having the surgery in the U.S. is being blamed on junk food diets and lack of exercise - with fears growing that the UK will follow suit. Data suggests the phenomenon is happening on both sides of the Atlantic because of the pressure bulging waistlines are putting on the joints. There are also concerns people's artificial knees will not survive under the strain. The latest research in the U.S. shows total knee replacements (TKRs) were easily outpacing total hip replacements (THRs) over the past 20 years - coinciding with the obesity epidemic. Dr Peter Derman, an orthopaedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said: ‘Because excess body weight appears to be more damaging to the knee than to the hip the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity may explain the growing demand for knee replacements over hip replacements.’ In 1993 surgeons performed 1.16 TKRs for every THR - but this ratio grew to 1.6 by 2009, says the study published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. Interestingly, patients aged 18 to 64 experienced a more rapid rise in obesity compared to those who were older. From 1997 to 2009 the share of the younger group undergoing TKR rose 56 per cent compared with only 35 per cent for THR. Dr Derman said: ‘We observed growth of knee replacement volumes was far outpacing that of hip replacements and were curious as to the origins of this trend.’ Previous studies have found a strong link between a higher BMI (body mass index) and knee osteoarthritis. The effects of weight on hip osteoarthritis were less clear. So the researchers reviewed at least 10 years of national data up to 2009 on numbers of knee and hip replacements, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality and orthopaedic workforce trends. They found TKRs have far outstripped THRs for patients with a BMI of at least 25 - which is considered overweight - or 30, which is deemed obese. But the same pattern was not seen for those with a BMI of less than 25. The researchers also looked at whether payment could have played a part which does not seem to be the case. Fees for TKR in the U.S. fell from about $3,000 a case in 1995 to $1,560 in 2009 and those for THR from $2,840 to $1,460. The trend is being blamed on soaring obesity rates as heavier people put more pressure on their joints . As this represents an approximate 48 per cent drop in fees for both procedures surgeons do not appear to be performing more TKRs over THRs because of higher reimbursement. Hospital reimbursement, length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality pertaining to TKR and THR also comparably declined between 1995 and 2009. Dr Derman said: ‘We found this differential growth rate in total knee replacement procedures could not be attributed to changes in physician or hospital payments, length of hospital stays, in-hospital death rates or surgical work force characteristics.’ Junk food diets are thought to be responsible for the rising obesity levels which are fuelling the demand for knee replacements . A couple . of years ago figures for the UK showed an emerging trend of requests for . knee replacements for arthritic ‘baby boomers’ in their 50s. A . report in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism said work is urgently needed to . check if giving artificial joints to this age group is wise given the . product’s unknown life expectancy. The durability of the replacement knees has only been assessed in patients in their 60s, 70s and 80s - not in their 50s. Best estimates suggest the joints last for about 15 years in these older and often less physically active recipients. Dr Derman said: ‘If rates of overweight and obesity continue to climb we should expect further acceleration in the number of knee replacements performed annually in the U.S. with a more modest increase in hip replacement volumes. ‘This knowledge can inform future policy decisions regarding health care funding and surgical workforce training as well as guide allocation of preventative health resources.’ Professor Kay, of the Royal College of Surgeons, said he was not surprised U.S. doctors are blaming an alarming rise in surgery in the under 65s on junk food diets and lack of exercise. The national clinical director for musculoskeletal services for NHS England said: ‘We are a little bit behind the States - we are not quite as fat yet - but we are getting there. ‘We must get the message across to patients and the public at large to lose weight and get fitter so they do not need knee replacements. ‘It’s easy to say we should be fitter but heart disease, lung disease and cancer can be avoided - and mental health boosted - by improvements in lifestyle.’ He said the total number of knee replacement procedures entered into the National Joint Registry during 2012 was 90,842 - an increase of 7.3 per cent compared with 2011. Of these, 84,833 were primary cases of which osteoarthritis was blamed for 98 per cent of them.","Huge rise in the number of under 65s in the U.S. needing the surgery .

Brave: Harry Beardsell must wear shades all year round to protect him from the effects of an incurable disease . Even the family home has tinted windows to make Harry's life more bearable. His mother Nicola Watts, 33, said: 'Harry has to be careful all year round to keep his eyes protected, but he has to take extra care in the summer. 'He will wear a hat and glasses whenever he leaves the house, or the glare of the light would be unbearable. 'Before he wore them, being in the sun was absolute agony for him - walking on the beach near our house was out of the question.' 'Harry once told me that he couldn’t wait until he was older and didn’t have to wear the sunglasses anymore, but I gently explained that it wasn’t going to work like that. 'He never complains, he just accepts it - he’s a lovely little boy.' Plight: Harry suffers from a rare condition . called cystinosis.This causes crystals to form in his eyes, making the . glare of normal daylight unbearable - even on a relatively dull day . Harry was diagnosed with cystinosis the day after his first birthday. His mother said: 'I was devastated. They described it as a long term, terminal illness. 'You just think that your precious, gorgeous little boy is going to die. 'No matter how much they explain it to you, that’s all that you hear - I couldn’t take any of it in.' Ms Watts first noticed something was wrong with Harry when he was nine months old. She said: 'He kept getting the flu and had a rattly chest. He was always thirsty and was sick quite a lot, but every time I took him to the doctors I was told he was fine. 'Doctors said I was just an over cautious first time mum and had nothing to worry about.' But on Christmas day 2008, Harry took a turn for the worse, being violently sick. Bond: Harry with his mother, Nicola. Even the family home has tinted windows to make his life more bearable . 'I rushed him to A&E where he was eventually diagnosed with rickets. It was a relief at the time because I thought I’d finally found out what was wrong with him and he could be cured. 'But all of his levels continued to remain low, so we were transferred to another hospital - it was when I walked into that hospital that I knew something was really wrong with Harry, because all the other patients were in such a bad way.' Today Harry is a happy six year old boy, but must take 13 different types of medication every day. He also uses eye drops which to try and break down the crystals. His mother said: 'He’s really upbeat and cheeky, and has lots of friends who are very protective of him. 'I’m so proud of him - he makes me smile every day.' Battle: Harry was diagnosed with cystinosis the day after his first birthday. His mother said: 'I was devastated. They described it as a long term, terminal illness' Harry is now eating solid food, but had previously needed a tube directly into his stomach. Jonathan Terry, 51, the founder of Cystinosis Foundation UK and the oldest person with the condition outside of the U.S., said: 'Cystinosis is a condition where the sufferer cannot break down the cysteine amino aside. 'A normal person can excrete this acid, but for people with the condition, the acid attacks every organ in the body, particularly the kidneys, liver and pancreas. 'Most patients will have to have a transplant by the time they are seven or eight or they will most likely die. 'Many, like Harry, will have to wear glasses because the crystals of the acid build up in the cornea and magnify the light in all directions like a diamond would. 'It makes glare of normal daylight unbearable - even on a relatively dull day it would seem bright.

"By . Chris Pleasance . A mother-of-one who has already given away a kidney, eggs and part of her liver to complete strangers is now trying to donate a lung. Sue Gianstefani, 47, gave her kidney to an elderly man in the US, her eggs to a childless couple in Australia, and part of her liver to a 12-year-old in the UK. Now the mother-of-one is trying to give away her lung, and insists husband Roland, 51, and 19-year-old son Daniel support her all the way. Susan Gianstefani, 47, has given away her kidney, eggs and part of her liver and is now trying to donate a lung . Despite risking infection, bleeding, blood clots and death, Mrs Gianstefani insists husband Roland, 51 (pictured), and 19-year-old son Daniel stand behind her decisions . Her obsession with organ donation began in 2001 when she posted an advert online offering to give away a kidney in return for travel and living expenses. The ad read: 'Free kidney, no strings attached.' Mrs Gianstefani's first donation was to American Larry Rosenfield (pictured) who was dying of a genetic kidney disease . Larry Rosenfield, from the US, replied. The 60-year-old said he was dying from a genetic kidney disorder, was already on dialysis, and that time was running out. After establishing that she was a match, Sue flew to the US for the operation. She told the Daily Mirror: 'You don't need two kidneys, a lot of people are born with only one. Why not give one to someone who needs it?' Mr Rosenfield, from Colorado, had to fly to Wisconsin with Mrs Gianstefani for the operation after surgeons in his home state refused to carry out the procedure. But following the operation Mr Rosenfield is now 73 and living an active life. After hearing about the generous kidney donation, a childless couple in Australia got hold of Mrs Gianstefani to ask if she would consider donating some eggs to them for IVF treatment. She donated 27 eggs, and managed to find out that three had been fertilised before losing touch with the couple. To this day she has no idea if the pair ever managed to have children using her eggs. Mrs Gianstefani was forced to go abroad to make all of her donations as altruistic donation was illegal in the UK until 2006 amid fears that people could be coerced into giving. Mrs Gianstefani (front left) travelled to Wisconsin in the US to donate the kidney. Mr Rosenfield (right, in bed) is now 73 and living a healthy and active life . In December last year Mrs Gianstefani (in bed) donated part of her liver to a 12-year-old in the UK (pictured at Kings Hospital alongside husband Roland) But after the law changed Mrs Gianstefani contacted the NHS, saying she wanted to donate a part of her liver. In December last year Kings Hospital got in touch to say they had a little boy close to death who was in need of a liver. She added: 'I don't know who he is but he's doing well and started nursery in April.' Mrs Gianstefani says she donates to give other people a chance at life, but by undergoing so many surgeries, she is risking her own . Altruistic organ donation used to be illegal in the UK until 2006, as it was feared that donors could be forced into donating or do it for money. But now increasing numbers of altruistic donors - meaning donors from outside the immediate family of the patient - are coming forward to give away their organs. Living donation is major surgery, and comes with all the risks associated with any other operation - including infection, bleeding, blood clots and death. Some operations are riskier than others. Living kidney donations are relatively safe, with donors having a 1 in 3,000 chance of dying from the surgery. Common complications include protein in urine and high blood pressure. However for liver donation, the risks are much greater. Donors can suffer abdominal bleeding, bile leakage, bowel obstructions and kidney failure. For lung patients, the risks are higher still. Surgery can cause a fistula - a type of abscess - between the lung and its outer wall which can lead to air leaking out. Another potential risk is ventricular fibrillation arrest, a type of cardiac arrest, which can lead to sudden death.","Susan Gianstefani first donated kidney in 2001 to elderly US patient .

Dr Rebecca Slane has reinvented herself as Toxic Cherry, a pole dancer and burlesque performer . The first class honours graduate and lecturer was top of her class at the University of Sunderland, spending her day in a white coat and sensible shoes . Cherry said she has never looked back since leaving her job as a lecturer in medicinal chemistry to launch her own dance school. She took up the pole when looking for a new form of exercise to get her in shape while she was studying for her PHD. And her inspiration came in the form of an Australian pole dancer. 'She was brilliant,' said Cherry, a former gymnast who grew up in Newcastle. 'She . was sexy and she had boobs and a bum! She had a great figure without . being stick thin. I learned a lot from her and eventually I took over . her classes. 'I finished my .

"By . Jessica Valentine . Each morning before she gets dressed to go  to school, I make sure my eldest daughter Josie brushes her teeth, applies sunblock to her face (even in winter) and puts deodorant under each arm. It’s a simple, essential hygiene routine. But I’m aware the last bit might raise a few eyebrows – because  my daughter is just seven years old, still plays with dolls and has yet  to lose any of her baby teeth. In fact, I am sure some who read this will be aghast. But I disagree. What sort of mother would I be if I allowed her to be singled out as the smelly child at school? No sweat: Jessica Valentine has let her seven-year-old daughter Josie start using deodorant so she will not be 'the smelly child' at school . Especially as it was Josie who first noticed that her armpits were a bit whiffy one day back in February – a month after her seventh birthday. We’d arrived home from an afternoon playing in the local park with her sisters Sophie, six, and Bella, four, when Josie asked me to take a look at her armpits. ‘They feel wet, Mum,’ she told me. She was right. And when I playfully scooped her up into my arms and gave them a bit of a sniff, I discovered they also smelled of sweat. I didn’t make a big deal of it and kept the conversation light, pulling a funny face as I told her: ‘Yuk, they smell, we’d better get you some deodorant, but until we do you can use mine.’ I’m a very matter-of-fact person, however delicate the subject. Health and hygiene: Josie uses a paraben and aluminium-free deodorant . Josie just smiled at me – it didn’t bother her. She watches me get ready every day, so when I handed the deodorant to her and said ‘Here, put some on!’ she knew exactly what to do. I let her take responsibility for putting it on every morning because she and her sisters need to learn how to look after themselves and develop good habits. If she occasionally forgets, I don’t make a big deal of it. Although it might sound extreme, I’m far from unusual. Parenting websites such as mumsnet are littered with discussions in which perplexed mothers voice concerns that their very young kids need deodorising. It’s not as if I’m sending her out to the beauty salon to get a spray tan and false nails. This is an issue of personal hygiene and dignity. As a result of growing demand, there are now several brands on the market for children, such as Missy, although most are marketed at kids aged 11 and over. Many parents choose brands which, although not specifically for kids, use only natural ingredients, including Tom’s of Maine, Bionsen and JASON, the one I buy for Josie which is paraben and aluminium-free. My sister had breast cancer and there have been suggestions of  a link between the ingredients in some deodorants and tumours, so I buy only cosmetic products that are entirely natural. Josie didn’t have a say in which deodorant she uses. I got it from an organic supermarket near our home in Brighton. I use deodorant by Neal’s Yard myself, but that’s too expensive for a little girl. I’m not aware of any of her little friends using deodorant, but give it a couple of years and I expect they’ll all be using it and wearing their first bras too. Certainly, much has been written about today’s children starting puberty earlier – so-called precocious puberty – with studies appearing to show that diet, obesity and the chemicals in our foods are the key influencing factors. Girls have always developed earlier than boys – on average the onset of puberty happens between the ages of eight and 12 years in girls and between nine and 14  in boys. However, I feel Josie’s too young for the dampness and odour to be a pre-cursor to puberty and her body isn’t showing any of the classic signs. She’s simply a very active, energetic little girl who’s constantly on the go, running around and playing sports such as football. So inevitably she’s going to sweat – and smell – more than children her age who are less active. Health and hygiene: Jessica does not think her daughter is too young to start using deodorant, as she does not want her to be picked on at school . As a former teacher, and now a psychologist specialising in children’s and women’s issues, I know more than most how being singled out as the smelly child at school can have a negative impact on a youngster’s self-esteem. For the sake of a stick of deodorant, I wasn’t going to allow that to happen to my daughter. Kids can be cruel, and if they tell you your teeth are yellow or you stink, it sticks with you throughout your life. I can remember every cruel jibe about how skinny and flat-chested  I was in my teens, even though  I’m very confident in myself as  now I approach my 40th birthday. Like most little girls, Josie loves to perch at my dressing table, exploring the various bottles of perfume and rummaging through the contents of my make-up bag. For her, deodorant is just an extension of that – something that her mummy uses every day – the only difference being that she has her own stick  that sits by her bed. My husband Jonathan is 42 and works in communications in the  City and, like me, he feels strongly that the girls must wait until they’re teenagers before we allow them to have their ears pierced or wear make-up. But there are certain things that can become prematurely essential for some children, and in Josie’s case that is deodorant. Equally, if Josie, Sophie – who has very dark hair – or Bella come to me in the next couple of years and say they’re very self-conscious because their legs have got hairy, for example, I’ll talk to them about what we could do about it. And, yes, that would include getting them waxed at a salon. I’m dark-haired and began shaving my own legs from eight years old because I was in danger of being picked on at school. The most important thing is that Josie and her sisters practise good personal hygiene and grow up to  be happy, confident little girls who aren’t left in tears in the school playground because somebody told them they smelt sweaty. Why would I allow that to happen when it can all be solved with a simple stick of deodorant, even if she is only seven years old?","Jessica Valentine's daughter Josie, seven, has begun sweating early .

"By . Thea Jourdan . Swathed in yards of pink tulle, with crystal slippers peeping from under her petticoats, my six-year-old daughter is in heaven. Her eyes are glittering both with excitement and the sparkly eyeshadow that spills like pixie dust on to her cheeks. With her dark hair festooned in ringlets and silk flowers, and bathed in the peachy light emanating from a huge crystal chandelier, she looks like a cross between Cinderella and a stick of candyfloss. Imogen's beatific smile breaks only to squeal with pleasure as Marian, her 'fairy godmother in-waiting', approaches with a tiara. 'May all your dreams come true,' she sighs in her tinkly, sing-song voice as she places it, Coronation-style, upon Imogen's head. 'Now you are a real princess.' Scroll down for video . Little princess: Thea's daughter Imogen is given a fairytale make-over at Harrods . I have to admit I am starting to feel a little queasy, and not just from the overwhelming clouds of hairspray drifting like mustard gas across the room. Imogen and I are trying out the ultimate in girly grooming at the newly opened Disney 'Bibbidi Bobbidi' Boutique on the fourth floor of Harrods, Knightsbridge. Parents will recognise the name of the boutique from the song sung by the Fairy Godmother in the Disney film of Cinderella, but all connections to ordinary family experiences end there. For an eye-watering £1,000, little girls are treated to an hour of preening that would seem over the top for Liberace. They are also given an obscenely large goody bag including all the Disney princess dolls, a luxury travel case and a party dress guaranteed to make them the envy of the school party scene for as long as it fits. Princess Imogen when off regal duty . The princess makeover has attracted a steady stream of young ladies, said to include a real princess or two, since it was launched before Christmas - though Harrods and Disney won't name names. One of the fairy godmothers in waiting explained it thus: 'The sum of £1,000 means nothing to lots of people who come to Harrods.' Surveying the opulence, I see her point. Just a browse through the children's clothing department during the sales demonstrates how much wealthy parents are prepared to spend on their children: Dolce & Gabbana shoes for £287, sparkly tights for pre-schoolers, reduced from £80 to £40. I watch opened-mouthed as Imogen falls into a quasi-swoon of girlie bliss. What has happened to my tomboy daughter? She is absolutely loving this. Five packages are on offer, costing £100 right up to the £1,000 Royal Experience, which includes the full makeover, framed photo, glittery shoes, tiara and dress. From the moment you arrive at reception, complete with stained glass windows, your girl becomes the centre of the universe. She is greeted by her own fairy-godmother in waiting - in this case, Marian - who hovers at the doors of the mock 'castle' before whisking her inside. We walk through a corridor designed to look like the walls of a medieval fortress, pausing to stop at the Magic Mirror. This reveals the curvaceous form of the Fairy Godmother herself, who tells Imogen to not just look like a princess but act like one, too. And then, a few magic words later, we are ushered into the pink and gold boutique itself. I note with a raised eyebrow that there are crystals inlaid into the floor. After slipping into her truly amazing pink dress, Imogen clambers up on her blue and gold high seat next to seven-year-old Maria. Like me, Maria’s mother, Kristina, 32, a health and fitness specialist from Weston-Super-Mare in Somerset, has come with her husband, George, 39, to watch her daughter be transformed into a princess. Maria is Kristina's only daughter and she wants to spoil her while she can. 'It's great to give them the chance to become a princess while they're young enough to enjoy it.' Sunita Patel, an accountant from North-West London and mother of Nerisa, four, waited two weeks for her appointment. 'I think £200 to £500 is reasonable to spend on a child - £1,000 does seem a lot but if you can afford it, why not?' she says. And it seems there is no shortage of parents who can - although, in fairness, the 'budget' end seems very popular, too. No expense spared: The Harrods boutique offers experiences from £100 to £1,000 . I spy a three-year-old having the £100 experience. Luckily, she is too young to care that she only gets a T-shirt and a tutu. I can't help thinking children shouldn't be exposed to an adult pecking order within their fantasy world . I suddenly worry that Disney's magic is placing unfair pressure on parents to let children live out their dreams, even if it means spending money they don't have. While Imogen is loving being top of the princess tree, it makes me uncomfortable: I can't help thinking children shouldn't be exposed to an adult pecking order within their fantasy world. When I try to discuss this subject with one of the fairy godmothers-in-waiting, I'm met with a blank stare. They never step out of their carefully rehearsed roles. Marian keeps breaking into song and spinning around the room as piped Disney film music fills the air. Imogen, meanwhile, treats this as nothing more than her due: I swear if the furniture started dancing and singing, she wouldn't bat an eye. Everyone calls her Your Highness and hangs on her every word. During her makeover, she is very sure of what she wants: princess pink nail polish and, to my dismay, the gaudiest face paint imaginable. Inspiration: Children can get their own fairy godmother for the day - if their parents can afford it . At the end of the experience, I have to admit Imogen does look amazing and I can't stop a smile of pride crossing my face. She nods regally as Marian asks her to confirm her royal oath - to be kind and gentle, loyal and trustworthy. Then comes the best bit - Imogen making her grand exit down the Egyptian Escalator and through the Food Hall, with the elan of a teeny Audrey Hepburn. The throng of shoppers parts like the Red Sea, and there is even a ripple of applause as she passes the shellfish counter. How on Earth do you tell your daughter . that she isn't really a princess when she decides she doesn't want to . tidy her room any more? All eyes are upon her for those few minutes as she makes her Royal Progress to Basil Street. Not even the ranks of Middle Eastern supercars can outshine her as she steps into a taxi, aided by a charmed Harrods concierge. I can't help thinking the 'once in a lifetime experience' could be setting me up for a lifetime of trouble. How on Earth do you tell your daughter that she isn't really a princess when she decides she doesn't want to tidy her room any more? And can it ever be right to blow the price of a small second-hand car on a few moments of happiness for a child? Will she now be disappointed with the treats we can usually afford, such as trips to the zoo? I would love to tell you Imogen lived up to all the solemn promises she made when she was crowned atop her velvet throne. But no. When I gently suggested she share some of her treasures with her cousins, explaining she had no need for 11 princess dolls, she stamped her foot at the idea. But then, perhaps even real princesses are allowed to have tantrums sometimes.","Disney 'Bibbidi Bobbidi' Boutique has opened at Harrods .

"By . Tom Kelly . and Anna Hodgekiss . Sophie Anderson was a healthy 11-year-old primary school pupil who ‘loved her food’. But then her family received a letter warning that she was ‘at risk of being overweight’ – helping to trigger a near deadly obsession with her body image. The once fun-loving schoolgirl became anorexic, and increasingly withdrew from her family as her weight fell to less than four stone. Scroll down for video . Sophie Anderson (with her mother, Mary) battled anorexia at the age of 11 and ended up weighing under 4st . With her major organs on the brink of shutting down, she was only saved after being force-fed through a tube in hospital. Now aged 13 she is recovering and yesterday spoke out against the ‘ridiculous’ decision to weigh youngsters at school as part of the National Child Measurement Programme. A week after she joined her fellow  Year 6 pupils in stepping on the scales, a letter was sent to her home with graphs attached which said she was at risk of being overweight. Sophie said: ‘It’s ludicrous to weigh children at that age because before puberty you get a bit of puppy fat to prepare you for a growth spurt. ‘I think that’s very misleading and potentially very damaging for a child to be warned about their future weight at that time when they already becoming self-conscious about their appearance. I really believe it should be stopped.’ The Norfolk teenager, who appeared on ITV’s Daybreak programme yesterday, said all the children at her school compared the letters and talked about it in class which only made things worse. She said: ‘I had been a completely happy child but from around this time I started becoming more self-conscious about my body. The letter was certainly part of it. I am also a perfectionist, which makes you more susceptible to anorexia. ‘I started off on a diet and it just progressed from there. I started losing weight rapidly.’ After being force fed to save her life she spent several months at an adolescent psychiatric unit before being discharged. Her mother, Mary, described it as a ‘terrifying illness’ and called for more to be done to stop the obsession with diets and weight. She said: ‘The letter we got was typical of this problem. ‘At the time, Sophie loved her food, she was a healthy little girl going through natural bodily changes. Speaking on ITV's Daybreak, she said: I think as you grow up there are so many pressures and expectations. From food, people can almost find a coping mechanism for the pressure' Girl Guides will learn about beauty myths and the tricks of ‘airbrushing’ amid what has been described as a crisis of self-confidence in young girls. Guides will spot which magazine pictures have been touched-up and discuss unattainable body traits to win a new ‘Free Being Me’ badge - as part of a programme to improve flailing self-esteem. The new badge will also be open to Brownies, aged seven to 10, who will explore how girls are portrayed as princesses. Girlguiding has teamed up with the Dove Self Esteem project, a campaign to promote ‘real women’s bodies’, to try and boost body confidence in young girls who are feeling the pressure conform to unrealistic ideals. A Girlguiding survey found 87 per cent of young girls think they are judged more on looks than ability and one in four girls aged between 11-to-21 would consider cosmetic surgery. One in five girls of primary school age say they have been on a diet and more than a third of teenage girls have skipped meals to try and lose weight. Chief Guide Gill Slocombe, said: ‘Along with Girlguiding’s 100,000 amazing volunteers, I am committed to helping girls develop into happy, self –confident young women – ready to take on the world. ‘But they hear all this stuff about  how “you are going to be obese” and it really doesn’t help. ‘It’s so important that we stress to teenage girls the simple fact that food is good for you and it keeps you alive. ‘One of the shocking things about anorexia is that it’s a mental illness, not just a physical thing. Sophie went from being a really happy girl to being a shell. There is a complete personality change. She got to the point where her organs were shutting down. She was at risk of dying.’ Sophie also called for more to be done to raise awareness of anorexia in children. She said: ‘I think it’s really important that schools talk about eating disorders. I’m back at school and I feel so much better about everything so there is hope you can recover. ‘My parents supported me but it took a massive toll on everyone and I just hope my story can help others to avoid going through what me and my family did.’ Hundreds of children have been sent letters informing them they are overweight or obese since the controversial child-measurement programme started in 2006. Assessments are based on BMI – or body mass index – which compares weight and height. Critics say BMI does not account for muscle –  so a rugby player could end up classed as obese – and does not account for height and body shape. This leads to taller people more often branded overweight as well as girls going through puberty who are developing breasts. Eating disorder charities have described the letters issued by the National Child Measurement . Programme as a ‘scare tactic’ that could have damaging effects on vulnerable youngsters. But health campaigners say it is vital to help warn parents about the dangers of obesity. NHS  figures show the number of children admitted to hospital with obesity-related conditions has risen four-fold in a decade.","Sophie Anderson, now 13, says the eating disorder nearly killed her .

"By . Wills Robinson . Children and young people are being encouraged to try electronic cigarettes by enticing sponsorship campaigns and celebrity culture, a new report has claimed. Cancer Research UK said it does not want e-cigarettes to be banned because they can help people quit the habit, but is calling for children to be protected from excessive advertising, flamboyant packaging and the variety of flavours on offer. Researchers analysed almost 1,000 individual pieces of marketing for the digital cigarettes placed on social media sites, in busy urban areas and on the way to major events such as music festivals. Unregulated marketing: A report by Cancer Research found more than 1,000 different pieces of advertising e-cigarettes, some of which are encouraging children . They found examples of online promotions including competitions, apps on mobile phones, and group discount vouchers for e-cigarettes. Sponsorship of a range of sports, including motor and powerboat racing, was also highlighted as a promotional strategy used by a number of companies. Researchers found e-cigarettes were promoted on the way to events such as Glastonbury, in busy locations such as Canary Wharf in London, on company websites and in specialist shops. Alison Cox, Cancer Research UK's head of tobacco policy, said: 'Tobacco cigarettes cause one in four cancer deaths. Hundreds of children start smoking every day and we don't want the marketing of e-cigarettes to confuse the message that smoking kills. 'We aren't opposed to e-cigarettes being . marketed to adult smokers - and hope that the marketing effort . encourages many smokers to give up. Variety: The range of flavours is one of the attributes said to be enticing young people to try e-cigarettes (file picture) 'There's evidence in the report - particularly on social media - of e-cigs being promoted as cool and the latest thing and applying all the kinds of marketing ploys that would be used to attract a youth market, including involving pop stars, computer games and one e-cig company even sponsoring a football youth team's strip."" Professor Gerard Hastings, report co-author at the University of Stirling, said: 'E-cigarettes and other alternative nicotine delivery devices are probably much safer than conventional cigarettes, and so if smokers switch to them, many lives could be saved. 'But the market is looking to make money, not improve public health, and this is creating many dangers. 'The fact that multinational tobacco companies are moving in on this market is of particular concern. From past experience, we know they are deceitful, determined and deeply detrimental to public health.' The report comes as a separate study from London Economics found no change in the prevalence of cigarette smoking in Australia since the introduction of plain packaging in December 2012. Dr Gavan Conlon, lead researcher and London Economics partner, said: 'Over the timeframe of the analysis, the data does not demonstrate that there has been a change in smoking prevalence following the introduction of plain packaging despite an increase in the noticeability of the new health warnings.'","Cancer Research found more than 1,000 individuals pieces of marketing .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A training program designed to test a woman's compatibility as an office secretary in 1959 has been unearthed by The National Archives Text Message blog. The 25-point list, which was compiled for an unknown company in Waco, Texas, reveals the skills you'd need to fit right in to 'the business world' as a woman in mid-century America. 'Is my voice pleasing and well modulated?' is among one of the more amusing requirements. 'When people bore me, do I conceal it?' Perfect poise: A 25-point checklist, unearthed from the National Archives, reveals what it takes to be a secretary in 1959, and some of the requirements are somewhat hilarious . And although it would be entirely unacceptable to print some of these phrases on a job application in this day and age, it goes without saying that some of these sentiments will still serve you well today. 'Do I control my impulse to meddle in other people's business?' it asks, 'Do I avoid gossiping?' Some self-evaluational questions come off as a little more controversial to the modern eye. If you happen to be intelligent, or possess a mind of your own, for example, you'd better not show it. 'Do I refrain from showing off how much I know?' it begs. 'Do I refrain from talking about myself?' The list in full: A score of 80 per cent reveals a 'good personality rating for the business world', and falling short of this requires you to 'work towards personal improvement' And, reasonably enough, the list certainly seems to be eking out any sort of cattiness in the workplace. 'Do I avoid making fun of others behind their back?' it asks. 'Do I refrain from making sarcastic remarks?' Many of the requirements on the list compare easily to the current job description for a secretary on totaljobs.com. Am I always on the alert to improve my vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar? The 1959 list poses the questions: 'Do I smile readily and naturally?’ and ‘ Can I talk to the boss as easily as to the office boy?' Totaljobs.com suggests an applicant should be 'Friendly and polite (manners cost nothing after all)', 'Discrete' and the owner of 'A bright and positive attitude.' Having said that, no job description today would stretch as far as: 'Am I always on the alert to improve my vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar?' And if you assumed, with the advance of technology, that secretaries were now a dying breed - think again. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the most common job for a woman in today's America is - drum roll - a secretary, followed by a cashier, a teacher and then a nurse. And of the four million secretaries employed in 2010; only 4 per cent of them were men. Not a dying breed: According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the most common job for a woman in today's world is still a secretary, and this shows no sign of changing . Additionally, according to the Labor Department projections, it's a category that is on the up, and set to grow 12 per cent between 2010 and 2020. Ray Weikal, spokesman for the International Association of Administrative Professionals told CNN Money last year: '[Historically] Every time a major new technology showed up, there were always predictions that this would spell the end of secretaries. 'You saw that with the development of electric typewriters, the personal computer and the internet, but every time technology gets more efficient...You continue to need people who can use those tools.' Perhaps in the future, we will look back on today's job descriptions and chortle; but in any case it would seem, long live the secretary.","The 25-point requirement list for a secretary role has been revealed in a 1959 training manual .

There’s nothing more inconvenient than your washing machine breaking down when you’re wearing your last pair of clean pants - even worse when it’s late at night and your local launderette is closed. So could 24-hour outdoor laundry machines be the answer to all your washing woes? The Southglade Convenience Store in Bestwood, Nottingham certainly thinks so, as the shop has installed three of the giant appliances in their car park. Scroll down for video .

The Grandad-of-two, who has run the store for two years, said: 'Quite a few people have used the machines but once people realise what's going on we're expecting them to be used a lot more. 'People are generally quite confused - they want to know why there are washing machines outside - and when I tell them what it's about, most people seem to think it's a really good idea. Not going anywhere: 'Because of the weight of the machines,' there's no way they could be removed without a forklift truck, so we're not too worried about thefts,' says Mr Singh Lalli .

"By . Sean Poulter . Dentists are calling for a dramatic reduction of around 75 per cent in daily sugar consumption to save the nation’s teeth. Experts at University College London say consumption of added sugar in treats like sweets, cakes, chocolate and fizzy drinks should be cut to around four teaspoons a day. A cap at that level would equate to less than half a normal can of Coca-Cola, which contains nine teaspoons of sugar, two digestives or just one bowl of Kellogg’s Frosties cereal. If the sugar intake is cut to the level dentists want, that would be less than half a normal can of Coca-Cola or just two digestives . The availability of advanced toothpastes and the addition of fluoride to the water supply in some countries and regions has reduced tooth decay, however treatment still accounts for 6-10 per cent of total health costs. A study published today argues that only a significant cut in the use and consumption of sugar – particularly when it is added to processed food and drink – will make a difference. The findings will fuel demands for the introduction of some kind of sugar tax on fizzy drinks and other foods – similar to those applied to cigarettes – in order to drive up the cost and drive down consumption. Any such measure would be fiercely fought by the food industry, which insists sugar is natural source of calories and can be eaten safely as part of a normal healthy diet. The warnings about sugar consumption come from Professor Aubrey Sheiham, who is Emeritus Professor of Dental Public Health at UCL and co-author of the study. Prof Sheiham said: ‘Tooth decay is one of the most widespread health problems and it is thought around a third of UK children aged 12 have visible tooth decay. ‘Added sugar has found its way into almost all food, and the use of sugar as a means to calm, entertain, or reward children has become normalised, whereas sugar should be an occasional treat. ‘The government must stop acting in the best interests of the food and drink industry rather than individuals, and take action on sugar now.’ The government’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has expressed sympathy for the idea of a sugar tax, while an expert group set up by the official watchdog Public Health England has signalled it should be considered. An ‘options for action’ document prepared by the organisations identifies six possible ways of reducing sugar intake: a tax on sugary drinks; foods being reformulated to contain less sugar; a cut in portion sizes; advertising rules being tightened; health warnings on  sugary products; and encouraging farmers to grow fruit and vegetables instead of sugar beet. The report estimates that a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks, which would raise the price of a can from 70p to 84p, would cut the number of overweight Britons by more than a quarter of a million. The average sugar consumption per day is around 58g or 14.5 teaspoons for adults and 76g or around 19 teaspoons for teenagers. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recently called for a reduction in consumption to around 5 per cent of daily calories, which equates to 25g or six teaspoons. The new study suggests even lower levels are necessary to protect teeth from decay or caries, bringing the figure down to 2-3 per cent of calories, which equates to 15g a day or four teaspoons. That would represent a reduction of 74 per cent against the current average for adults. The research paper, co-authored by Prof Sheiham and obesity expert Professor Philip James, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is published in the Public Health Nutrition Journal.It concludes: ‘Previous analyses based on children have misled public health analyses on sugars….The much greater adult burden of dental caries highlights the need for very low sugar intakes throughout life, e.g. 2-3 per cent energy intake, whether or not fluoride intake is optimum.’ Nutritionist and Campaign Director of Action on Sugar, Katharine Jenner, backed the study findings, saying: ‘Added sugars are completely unnecessary in our diets and are strongly linked to dental decay as well as to obesity and Type II Diabetes.’","4tsps is equivalent to less  than half a normal can of Coca-Cola, .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Who doesn't want a washboard stomach, toned abs and buns of steal? Well, according to a controversial new theory from an Irish weight-loss expert, perhaps not as many of us as you'd think. Sociologist Dr Bernadette Rock believes that desperate dieters often want to retain their flab -- even if they don't realise it. Dublin based Dr Rock outlines her surprising theory on a Huffington Post blog, where she says that, despite common wisdom, there are many benefits to being overweight. She goes on to suggest that when dieters struggle to stick to regimes, . they're often subconsciously sabotaging their own attempts . because they want to retain their excess pounds. Dr Bernadette Rock believes that acknowledging the reasons dieters might like being overweight will help them achieve their goal . 'There are advantages to remaining overweight. If you are not aware of these benefits . and why you're holding on to your extra weight, then no amount of . dieting will keep those pounds at bay for good,' writes the sociologist, who runs HeyDay World, a non-dieting weight loss programme in Dublin. Talking to the MailOnline about her controversial theory, Dr Rock explained, 'It surprises many people that being overweight can serve a function. 'While a part of you feels bad about being overweight and despises having extra weight, there may be another part of you that is holding onto it,' she says. Dr Bernadette Rock, whose surprising theory on weight loss challenges the usual dieting theories . So what are these hidden benefits of carrying some extra inches? Dr Rock outlines four classic examples from clients: . 1. ""My reason for not doing things in life has been my weight. When I lose it, I won't have an excuse to put off life, such as applying for another job, or even getting on a flight"" 2. ""Having extra weight means I can blend into the background, without being the focus of attention, and I don't feel that I'm 'on show'"" 3. ""Weight makes me feel protected from other people. I think I might feel vulnerable if I lost it."" Dr Rock also refers to her personal weight loss experience. 'I recall feeling anxious or nervous about the increased personal power that I felt as the weight gradually fell off me,' she admits. But says, 'I’ve had some angry responses to my blog from people who believe I am blaming them for their weight. This is partly because there is such a culture of blaming overweight people. 'Instead this blog seeks to encourage people to step back with awareness and bring more understanding and non-judgement to their weight and eating habits.' What Dr Rock hopes is that readers will use this theory to help them on their weight loss journey. 'If you have recently . lost weight and fear that you will gradually regain the pounds, then it . is crucial that you look at the reasons why you might be holding onto . extra pounds,' she says. 'During all of my 16 years dedicated to chronic dieting and feeling out of control around food, one of my enduring beliefs was that being slim meant I would be lighter, happier and confident. 'After a few weeks of being 'good' and in control (as opposed to tucking into toast with melted butter, biscuits and any food not nailed down) the result, when I stepped on the bathroom scales, was that my weight had dropped,' she says. Don't blame the biscuits! A new theory suggests failing dieters WANT to be overweight . But she admits, 'Weeks of being good were suddenly unraveled in a moment of stress or anxiety. And isn't it amazing how much food you can eat in five minutes?' The Irish expert then explains, 'I was desperately seeking slimness but never thought to ask myself ""Why have I put myself in the position of being overweight again?"", ""Is a part of me holding onto my weight?"" 'Although a part of you does not want that extra weight and desperately wants to shed it, is there another part of you holding onto that weight? 'You might never have considered these questions: Why have you chosen to be overweight? What's in it for you by being overweight?' It's not surprising that when Dr Rock asks her clients if there are reasons they want to remain overweight, they usually respond with expression of incredulity and disbelief. But she believes there are advantages to remaining overweight, which dieters have to confront before successfully shedding pounds. 'A new slim body means a smaller version of yourself. You no longer have the fat to protect you,' she says. 'You may feel more fragile and vulnerable. Having extra weight has protected you. Without it you may feel exposed. That's one reason why many people who lose weight regain it.' Dr Rock concludes, 'If you are not aware of the benefits of your weight and your concerns about letting it go, you will struggle to reach and maintain a healthy weight.'

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Lifetime has announced a new reality TV show which will follow the escapades of soon-to-be nuns, entitled The Sisterhood. The unscripted series will sneak behind the doors of a Catholic convent and delve into the lives of five woman with a big decision to make: whether or not to fully commit themselves to God. The wannabe nuns will live and work in the convent as they take part in what is traditionally the first step in entering this religious order, the 'discernment phase.' Breaking bad habits: Lifetime's new reality TV show will follow five wannabe nuns as they enter a monastery for a trial period, where according to the network, their devotion will be 'truly tested' (file photo) Over six hour-long episodes, where the hopeful 'servants of God' will live according to the vows of  chastity, poverty and obedience, each woman will undergo a program which will 'truly test their devotion.' Already, the premise of the show is skirting the lines of 'reality', as women don't usually live in a convent during this phase. Once they have opened their minds to the possibility of joining the sisterhood, as it exists in the real world, a young woman will traditionally spend her discernment phase - amid her usual setting - pondering the pros and cons of forgoing single or married life. Round two: Original series, Breaking Amish, followed (from left), Sabrina, Abe, Rebecca, Jeremiah and Katie, on their travels to New York, all of whom have now returned to Pennsylvania except for Katie . Next she transitions into the 'postulancy' phase, which is a six month test period in which she will live according to the requirements of a nun, to see if the lifestyle truly appeals. Only then will she be accepted to live in a convent for one to two years, without taking vows, until she is finally absolutely certain that she is ready to live an ordained life - at which point she is permitted to take her vows. Of course, in the land of Lifetime - which is hiring the same producers who bought us the questionable 'reality' show, Breaking Amish - the standard process is 'accelerated', according to the network. Lifetime and collaborator Hot Snakes Media are in the process of finalizing the convent and location for The Sisterhood, and a premiere date has not yet been determined.",The Sisterhood will be produced by the same team who bought us Breaking Amish .
"By . Martyn Halle . Scroll down for video . Couples having trouble conceiving will soon be  able to carry out fertility treatment in the comfort of their own home. A leading high street chemist is offering a DIY  kit called The Stork that copies a form of fertility treatment called intrauterine insemination (IUI). It will be available for just £100 – a fraction of the £1,000 cost of going to a private clinic for a course of similar treatment. High-street baby-making: The new DIY fertility treatment kit The Stork copies a form of intrauterine insemination (IUI) and is designed to be used at home . Its makers say the device ‘helps bridge the gap between natural intercourse and in-clinic assisted treatments such as IUI and IVF’. They claim a success rate of about 20 per cent, comparable to the same treatment carried out by a doctor. However, studies on  the method found that pregnancy rates between those in the programme  and couples who dropped out and conceived without therapy were about the same. The Stork, pictured above, which is now available  online from Superdrug, is supposedly designed to help couples with ‘common fertility difficulties such as low sperm count, low sperm motility, ovulation timing and unexplained infertility’. It works by first collecting semen into a cervical cap, which is located at the  bottom of a condom-like sheath. Happy news: The makers of The Stork claim a success rate of about 20 per cent . An applicator then delivers the cervical cap containing the semen to the entrance of the cervix. The cap is left next the cervix for between four and six hours, then removed using a tampon-like pull cord. The cap keeps the semen as close to the cervix as possible to allow sperm to swim up to the egg. The makers maintain that normal daily activities can be carried out while the cap is in place. It is recommended that  The Stork be used just before and/or during ovulation. Gynaecologist Nick Morris, of the Wellington Hospital in London, felt the device had a place for some couples but pointed out that The Stork was not exactly the same as IUI. Under IUI, sperm is collected and ‘cleaned up’ before being placed into the woman’s womb close to the time of ovulation. ‘This would be an ideal option if a couple can  no longer have treatment  on the NHS or cannot afford to self-fund at a private clinic,’ he said. thestorkconception.co.uk .","The Stork copies a form of intrauterine insemination treatment .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A new survey has revealed the most costly regions around the country in which to hire a babysitter, with New York City at the top of totem pole, closely followed by Washington DC and Boston. Urbansitter.com, a site which allows parents to source local babysitters, polled more than 7,000 families across nine large metro city areas and concluded that the national average wage for babysitting one child is $14.97 per hour. New Yorkers fork out hourly wages of around $15.34 for one child, running up to $18.74 for three children, whereas in Denver, it's more in the region of $10.84 for one child and $14.24 for a trio. Expensive night out: A study by Urbansitter has revealed that New York babysitters charge the most, an average of $15.34 an hour for one child, compared with Denver, where $10.84 an hour is more the norm . Lauren Jimeson, a social media director and mother-of-three, tells ABC News she pays up to $25 an hour for 'quality' sitters, who won't just stick her kids, all under the age of five, in front of the television. The busy working mom was in for rather a surprise, however, during a recent family trip to Florida. 'We found a babysitter based on a friend’s recommendation. They only paid around $8 or $10. My husband and I looked at each other and said, ""Oh my gosh,"" because we pay double that for our kids', she says. The same study also found that 26 per cent of parents polled hire a babysitter once a week or more, and that nearly half are spending upwards of $1,000 a year on the privilege. How much for Kiefer Sutherland? The 24 star, (left) famously revealed he used to babysit actress Gwyneth Paltrow (right) way back in the day when she was a pre-teen . It might just be a factor in the trend that more women now choose to be stay-at-home moms than at any other time in the past two decades, according to a recent Pew Research report. And mothers who do work are paying more than ever for childcare; both for daycare - a 70 per cent increase nationwide since 1985, inflation taken into account - and for irregular babysitting. Again, costs for full-time daycare vary quite significantly according to where you live; New York unsurprisingly topping the list again at a cost of $12,355 annually, and Washington coming in cheapest at $9,240. And all that doesn't take tipping into account, with over 70 per cent of parents in UrbanSitter's survey saying they tipped their babysitters. 'You can’t really put a price on people taking care of your kids' It appears families aren't sticking with their sitters for very long either, with a high turnover rate reported, and less than six per cent of families saying they've kept the same sitter for more than five years. Interestingly, for the platinum credit card wielding parents of New York, it seems many are actually uncomfortable when prices seem too low. Lynn Perkins, founder of UrbanSitter, admits the service was initially free when it launched, which led New Yorkers to be suspicious. 'When we started charging [from $8.35 a month], our numbers actually went up in New York,' she told UpStart last year. Ultimately, for Ms Jimeson, the mother willing to pay up to $25 an hour for good service, the prices are worth it. 'It’s pretty incredible just how high [the costs are] here,' she remarks. 'At the same time, you can’t really put a price on people taking care of your kids.' 1. New York City . $15.34 . $18.74 . 2. San Francisco . $14.99 . $19.46 . 3.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . It was a day Graham Wagstaff feared he may never see. Diagnosed with terminal lung disease, he desperately needed a transplant if he was to see his daughter Helen get married. And to his utter relief, with just weeks to spare, he received a life-saving transplant in time to fly to California and walk her down the aisle. Joy: Graham Wagstaff was so ill with lung disease that he feared he wouldn't live to see daughter Helen's wedding day - let alone walk her down the aisle . Saved: Mr Wagstaff had been battling lung disease due to a congential condition for several years and desperately needed a transplant. He got one with just weeks to spare before the wedding . Happiness: 'Seeing my daughter get married and being able to walk her down the aisle was one of the best moments of my life, I'll never forget it,' he said . Mr Wagstaff, 68, from Albrighton, Shropshire, had suffered with terminal lung disease for several years due to a congenital condition. At one point he was so ill he was forced to close his business temporarily. He said: 'It’s amazing that someone saying ‘yes’ to organ donation has led to me getting my life back. 'I was on oxygen 24/7 before the op and was so close to dying. 'It was so emotional actually being able to walk Helen down the aisle on her wedding day - I never thought I’d get the chance - and it was such a perfect day.' 'Without my new lungs I wouldn’t be here today, it’s a gift that I won’t be able to repay. 'Seeing . my daughter get married and being able to walk her down the aisle was . one of the best moments of my life, I’ll never forget it. I’m so grateful that I finally have my life back.' Bride Helen said: 'Without the donor, my dad wouldn't have been able to walk me down the aisle - I can't imagine what my wedding would have been like without him' Mr Wagstaff's brother died 16 years ago from the same lung disease, alveolitis, when he was 49. He added: 'It was a shock when I received the same diagnosis, as knew how serious it could be.' Helen, who moved to California five years ago to work as a dancer and actress, had been terrified her father would die before he found a donor match. She said: 'It was amazing to have both my parents fly over to America for our big day in December. 'Dad was so unwell leading up to the wedding that we all feared he wouldn’t make it.' 'Without the donor my dad wouldn’t have been able to walk me down the aisle - I can’t imagine what my wedding would have been like without him.' Struggle: Before the transplant, Mr Wagstaff (pictured right with daughter Helen) was so ill he relied on oxygen 24 hours a day and had been forced close to his business . 'The day was so emotional, my dad’s speech was fantastic and it was amazing to see him looking so well after years of ill-health. 'As a family we want to do as much to raise awareness for Organ Donation as without it my dad wouldn’t be here today, my mum, Christine can’t believe how active he is now.' Mrs Wagstaff said: 'We all had a brilliant time at the wedding, it was extra special because of Graham’s miracle gift he received just months before. 'He has been able to reopen his business and it was magical to see him walking our girl down the aisle. 'There wasn’t a dry eye between us all.' Healthy: Mr Wagstaff (with daughter Helen and son-in-law Patrick) giving his speech at the wedding. His wife said there 'wasn't a dry eye in the house' Mrs Wagstaff said: 'Since the transplant, Graham has been able to reopen his business and it was magical to see him walking our girl down the aisle' Sally Johnson, Director of Organ Donation and Transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant said: 'Graham is living, walking proof of the benefits of organ donation. 'It’s wonderful that he was able to travel to California to give his daughter away on her wedding day when he had been so poorly before his transplant that he needed oxygen 24 hours a day. And that is thanks to his organ donor. 'Many of us say that we would support organ donation but not enough of us tell our families that we would like to give our organs to those that may need them after we have died. 'The sad fact is that less than a third of families will agree to donation going ahead if they don’t know it was what their loved one wanted. 'So for more people like Graham to get the life changing transplant they need, tell your family you’ve decided you’d like to donate your organs. 'Then join the NHS Organ Donor Register to record your decision by visiting organdonation.nhs.uk or calling 0300 123 23 23.' Relief: Mr Wagstaff and his wife, Christine.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A 36-year-old man has a rare condition that means his jaw will not stop growing. Just like Richard Kiel, who played the Jame Bond villain Jaws, Richard Moore has acromegaly which occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. In Mr Moore's case, the condition is caused by a two-and-a-half centimetre tumour on his pituitary gland. Richard Moore has a tumour on his pituitary gland which means too much growth hormone is produced. As a result, his jaw keeps growing. He is pictured (left) in 1999 before the problem developed and (right) in 2011 . Now he is facing painful surgery to have his jaw broken and realigned because it has grown by 2cm. Mr Moore said: 'I started noticing facial changes about ten years ago, my jaw was growing outwards and my teeth were becoming misaligned. 'I thought I was going mad - nobody else seemed to notice that my face was slowly changing shape. 'If you look back at photos of me in a timeline you can see the slow facial changes to a horrendous asymmetrical cross bite. 'My jaw just kept changing over time.'Mr Moore, from Wigan, started noticing changes to his face shape at 25-years-old when he realised his teeth no longer lined up. Mr Moore (pictured in 2006) had to have surgery to remove the tumour but it failed to solve the problem . Mr Moore has the same condition as Richard Keil (pictured) who played the James Bond villain Jaws in the film The Spy Who Loved Me . He also developed strange sensations in his head and low moods before finally being diagnosed in 2012. Oral drugs and injections failed to control the tumour and eventually it had to be removed during surgery through his nose. Acromegaly develops when the body produces too much growth hormone. This leads to excess growth of body tissues over time. It can cause abnormally large hands and feet, large facial features, an enlarged tongue and abnormally great height. It is caused by a tumour on the pituitary gland. Most patients can be successfully treated - brain surgery will often return hormone levels to normal. When the tumour is too large to be removed, medication can often help normalise hormone levels. Source: NHS Choices . Mr Moore, a student at Salford University studying wildlife conservation and zoo biology, said: 'I was diagnosed in 2012 after I got terrible headaches, broke out in sweats and had other strange symptoms. 'It is fair to say that I have always been conscious about my strong jawline - but there have been noticeable changes in my jaw over the last ten years. 'I couldn’t believe I’d had the condition for so long without knowing - I should have spent more time looking in the mirror and found a new dentist.' Mr Moore has bee warned by doctors that the condition can result in severe disfigurement, serious complicating conditions, and premature death if left unchecked. Mr Moore's surgery was thought to be successful but in January last year his symptoms returned. He said: 'I’m now on monthly chemical therapy which controls the residual tumour and the hormones it emits. 'I . sometimes do feel tired with a loss of energy, but compared to where I . was before my operation and treatment it’s massively improved. 'I . am out running every weekend but without the amazing care of the NHS . healthcare professionals at The Christie, Salford Royal and my GP Dr J D . Seabrook, I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful.' Mr Moore (pictured, left, in 2003 and, right, in 2005) was only diagnosed with the tumour when he developed severe headaches and a low mood. He also experienced strange sensations in his head . Mr Moore (pictured in 2011) is now facing painful surgery to have his jaw broken and realigned because his teeth are out of alignment as a result of the bone growth . A spokesperson from The Pituitary Foundation said: 'Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that results from too much Growth Hormone (GH) in the body. 'Acromegaly is caused by a benign tumour of the pituitary gland, which is called an adenoma and this causes the pituitary to produce too much GH. 'The nasal bone enlarges and teeth may be spaced out. An overgrowth of bone and cartilage can lead to arthritis and when tissue thickens it may trap nerves, causing carpal tunnel syndrome which results in weakness, numbness or pain in the hands. 'Organs in the body, such as the heart can also enlarge.'","Richard Moore had a two-and-a-half centimetre tumour on his pituitary gland .

Constantly questioning whether your partner loves you, whether they're the right person for you, or if you even love them at all, are all telling symptoms of the condition. Relationship Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder not only racks your nerves but could ruin your sex life . Other common behaviors included . constantly reassessing and doubting the relationship and thinking about and picking at their partner's perceived physical flaws. Compulsions can involve going to great . lengths to check that your partner is loyal, such as repeatedly calling . them, looking at their emails or Internet search histories or endlessly asking them whether they 'really mean it' when they express their love . Those who suffer these symptoms were identified as having relationship obsessive-compulsive disorder (ROCD) by researchers. And the participants were also found to be less satisfied with their sex lives than those who did not question . things irrationally, says the new study. This lower level of sexual satisfaction was explained by a decrease in relationship satisfaction - in other words, it seems that ROCD symptoms reduce relationship happiness, which, in turn, affects sex life, researchers said. One patients said that although he loved the woman he was in a relationship with, he couldn't stop thinking about whether he might be happier with women he saw on the street, or on Facebook . The findings, which were published online this month in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, could have implications for the treatment of some people with relationship and sexual problems, researchers said. 'ROCD symptoms are often overlooked by family and couple therapists,' said study researcher Guy Doron, of the School of Psychology at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya in Israel. According to Doron the new findings mean that people's sexual problems might stem from having ROCD and not knowing it, report LiveScience. Scientists . say ROCD is a form of obsessive compulsive disorder - a condition that . can bring unwanted thoughts or worries, and repetitive . behaviors that are carried out to address those worries, . usually to no avail. With . ROCD, obsessions usually fit into one of two categories: Questioning . whether you love your partner, or questioning whether your partner loves . you, said Steven Brodsky, a psychologist and clinical director who has treated patients with ROCD. For example, one of Doron's patients said that although he loved the woman he was in a relationship with, he couldn't stop thinking about whether he might be happier with women he saw on the street, or on Facebook. ROCD can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy if the symptoms end up pushing a partner away . It's normal to have some of these thoughts in relationships from time to time, Brodsky said, but a person is considered to have a disorder if the thoughts impair everyday life, such as the ability to do his or her job. Brodsky also noted that people with ROCD have unwanted thoughts even when there is no rational reason to question the relationship (i.e., their partner really does love them). Ultimately, these symptoms can lead to rocky relationships. 'These relationships can often repeatedly break up and reunite multiple times a week' or month, Brodsky said. ROCD can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy if the symptoms end up pushing a partner away. In the new study, 157 men and women in Israel filled out an online questionnaire intended to assess ROCD symptoms. Couples had been together for about 15 years, on average. Although the survey could not diagnose ROCD, afterwards Doron estimated that about 1 per cent had the condition. The more severe participants' symptoms were, the more likely the participants were to be unsatisfied with their sex lives. ROCD symptoms may undermine the ability of a couple to bond emotionally, and lead to stress and sadness, all of which may interfere with pleasure during sex, the researchers said.","Those with ROCD obsess over relationship irrationally .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A British woman has become the first in the world to give birth to twins while undergoing kidney dialysis. Doctors warned Sarah Pearce it would be impossible for her get pregnant. They feared the intense pressure the treatment had taken on the 29-year-old's body could render her unable to bear her own children. But Ms Pearce has defied the medical odds stacked against her, giving birth to twins. British woman, Sarah Pearce has become the first in the world to give birth to twins while undergoing kidney dialysis. The family is pictured in hospital . The new mother welcomed her son and daughter, Henley James Alex and Harper Faith Miracle, by emergency Caesarean section on June 1. For the last decade, Ms Pearce has faced dialysis three times a week after being diagnosed with serious kidney disease. The twins were delivered 12 weeks early at Sheffield’s Jessop maternity wing, Henley weighing 2lbs 1oz and Harper just 1lb 14oz. They are both being cared for on the special care unit where they will remain until they have reached the full 40-week term. The new mother said: 'A few years ago I was trying to get pregnant, but the doctors said it was impossible, and wouldn't happen because of the damage the dialysis had done to my body. 'But when I fell pregnant, they were gobsmacked. They couldn't believe it. 'They didn't think there was any way I would get to full term - they thought  the longest the babies would survive was 20 weeks.' ‘I was . shocked at first when I found out I was pregnant, but I’m so happy they . are here and well. It’s unbelievable. It’s all I’ve ever wanted, to be a . mum.' She . was diagnosed with incurable kidney scarring, which affects her organs’ ability to filter waste from the blood, when she was just six weeks . old. Feeling . tired and lacking energy, Ms Pearce, from Rawmarch, Rotherham, was . placed on the transplant list for a replacement kidney. The new mother welcomed her son and daughter, Henley (pictured) and Harper, by emergency Caesarean section, defying the medical odds stacked against her . The twins were delivered 12 weeks early at Sheffield's Jessop maternity wing, Henley weighing 2lbs 1oz and Harper (pictured) just 1lb 14oz . A . match was found and she was given a transplant aged 12, but . three-and-a-half years later, doctors discovered that her body was . rejecting the organ. ‘The transplant meant I didn’t have to go on dialysis, but when my blood results came back and showed I was rejecting it I had to start it then,’ she said. She used to . have to travel to Nottingham for dialysis at a children’s unit, but . then she started the treatment at Rotherham Hospital aged 21. 'They couldn't believe it was a normal conception, they'd never seen anyone like me before' - Sarah Pearce . Ms Pearce usually needs the treatment three times a week, but during her pregnancy doctors put her on daily dialysis. Women . with kidney failure are often advised against becoming pregnant because . of the high rate of complications for the mother and developing baby. Many women on dialysis have anaemia - a low red blood cell count - and hormone changes. Two . years ago, Ms Pearce gave birth to a son, Karter, who was three months’ premature and weighed just over 1lb, but the tiny boy died after only . four weeks. Ms Pearce said she went into a deep . depression after her loss. And with the risk of a similar situation . deemed high, doctors asked her if she wanted an abortion when she fell . pregnant again. A week before the Caesarean, a scan showed Henley was not getting enough blood flow to his umbilical cord. He is pictured in a special care unit at the hospital . Ms Pearce said she thinks that Harper (pictured) helped Henley in the womb and 'told him to carry on because she is the stronger one' But Ms Pearce was adamant, she would go through with the pregnancy. ‘I said no because I don’t believe in it, so they kept a close eye on me this time in case anything went wrong,’ she said. A week before the Caesarean, a scan showed Henley was not getting enough blood flow to his umbilical cord. She said: ‘I was scared it was happening again, but Harper helped a lot I believe - she helped Henley through it and told him to carry on because she is the stronger one. ‘At the Jessop’s they couldn’t believe it was a normal conception - they’d never seen anyone like me before.’ The . twins have been moved from Sheffield to Rotherham Hospital, where their . mother can easily visit them after her dialysis sessions. Ms . Pearce said: ‘Henley has been on a ventilator and Harper is fine, she . just needs to put more weight on. 'I sit with them all day, every day, watching them get stronger every day. 'They're so perfect and they're getting healthier all the time. In future Ms Pearce (pictured with her twins) could undergo another transplant, but she says it is a matter of waiting for a suitable match to be found . 'I was shocked at first when I found out I was pregnant, but I'm so happy they are here and well. It's unbelievable. It's all I've ever wanted to be a mum,' Ms Pearce said. The scans shown Harper and Henley . 'They have said they should be able to go home around their due date - August 28 - and I'm so excited to be a proper mummy to them.' Ms Pearce has made medical history by giving birth to twins while on kidney dialysis. She said: 'I've been told I am the first in the world to give birth to twins while on dialysis. 'It just happened completely out of the blue, and I was over the moon. I was told I'd lost my fertility due to the dialysis and so I just resigned  myself to believing it would never happen.' Sarah Pearce, 29, (pictured) was told she would never conceive because of the effect of years of kidney dialysis has taken on her body . Ms Pearce, who is unemployed due to a demanding dialysis routine, found out she was 12 weeks pregnant in January, after undergoing TWO routine operations under general anaesthetic. 'I went into hospital to have the operation in January and they took a routine blood test because I don't produce urine,' she said. 'I'd already had two operations and they didn't even know I was pregnant, so when I found out they had survived that, I knew they were meant to be here.' After being carefully monitored throughout the pregnancy, Sarah had scans every fortnight and attended hospital appointments every month to ensure the babies were healthy. Doctors booked Sarah in for a caesarean section at 32 weeks, but the babies decided they wanted to make an earlier appearance. She said: 'I always knew they were not going to go to full term, firstly  because they're twins and secondly because of my dialysis. 'I always talked to my bump and I told the babies to stay in there until 28 weeks. 'They listened to me because they stayed in there until the day after the 32 weeks when I went into labour. 'Although I was ready to push, I had an emergency caesarean section because they didn't want to take the risks. 'I was just relieved to learn they were healthy and be able to see my little boy and little girl in front of me.' In future Ms Pearce could undergo another transplant, but she says it is a matter of waiting for a suitable match to be found.","Sarah Pearce, 29 gave birth to Henley and Harper by emergency Caesarean section at Sheffield’s Jessop maternity wing .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Robots (pictured) are helping stroke victims to regain the use of their arms . Robots are helping stroke victims to regain the use of their arms. The machines work by supporting a patient’s arm and letting them move it between targets on a computer screen, to build up their strength and improve their coordination. ‘Rehabilitation robots’, which have been seen in a number of studies are being taken more and more seriously, with a major trial underway at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and Newcastle University. The stroke patient sits at a table facing a computer screen and places their arm on to the robotic device. A therapist then asks the patient to undertake some arm exercises, such as moving between targets on the computer screen. If the person is unable to move their arm, then the robot moves the patient's limb for them. If the patient starts to move, the robot provides adjustable levels of assistance to help out, in turn helping the brain and arm to learn to work together again. Helen Rodgers, professor of stroke care at the institute for ageing and health at Newcastle University, leading the research, said: 'Announcing the start of this clinical trial is a really exciting step forward for stroke rehabilitation research in the UK. ‘We have been looking at the research undertaken in the USA and we are working closely with colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to see if robot assisted training is an effective treatment. ‘If shown to be effective, robot assisted training has the potential to change how we provide NHS rehabilitation for people with arm weakness due to stroke.’ North Tyneside General Hospital is one of 16 stroke services to take part in the five-year clinical trial and is one of the first in the country to use the new robot. The £250,000 rehabilitation equipment was invented by scientists at MIT. A total of £3million has been given to the scheme by the National Institute for Health Research and a clinical trial in America has already shown that robot-assisted training may improve upper limb recovery. The stroke patient who has had a stroke sits at a table facing a computer screen and places their arm onto the robotic device (pictured). A therapist then asks the patient to undertake some arm exercises, such as moving between targets on the computer screen . Researchers from Newcastle University will work in collaboration with teams from the Universities of Glasgow, East London and Cambridge, as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and NHS stroke teams to test the equipment. Dr Hermano Igo Krebs, principal research scientist and lecturer at MIT, said: ‘The robotic technology we have developed at MIT is already helping many stroke patients and people with other neurological conditions in the U.S. ‘Our focus is on helping clinicians to facilitate a functional recovery for their patients by using intensive and highly interactive robotic therapy. ‘By using robotics, not only do we get a greater understanding of the neuro recovery process, but we can also build a rich stream of data that assists in ongoing patient diagnosis and customisation of the therapy.’ From April, researchers began to recruit patients who had suffered a stroke for the first time to participate in the clinical trial. Stroke sufferer Tom Means, 61, from Walkerville, Newcastle, is one of the patients already taking part in the robot clinical trial. He had a . stroke in March this year and spent around two months in hospital. Now . back at home, he continues to receive physiotherapy twice a week. Mr . Means attends North Tyneside General Hospital three times a week for . the 45-minute sessions on the stroke robot as part of the trial. If the person is unable to move their arm, then the robot moves the patient's limb for them (pictured). If the patient starts to move, the robot provides adjustable levels of assistance to help out, which helps the brain and arm to learn to work together again . After only a few sessions into the 12-week programme, he is already seeing improvements in his arm and shoulder. Mr . Means, who used to work as a self-employed electrician, was unable to . use his right arm or walk, but has gradually regained movement. ‘When you've had a stroke, every bit of exercise and movement you can do is a big help,’ he said. ‘Using the robot alongside my other exercises is ideal for me and what's great about the robot is that it also helps my hand-eye co-ordination. ‘I've only had a few sessions so far, however I've really felt the difference in my arm as I've got a lot more movement and much more strength. ‘I'm under no illusions that it's going to be a lot of hard work but it's all worthwhile because I know it's going to make me better. ‘I'm pleased to be taking part in the trial and helping people who suffer a stroke in the future.’","'Rehabilitation robots' are being trialled at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and Newcastle University .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Flatforms, which lack the discomfort of high heels or steep wedges, may be summer’s newest footwear trend – but they might also be the most dangerous. Though the retro-looking lovechild of a flat shoe and a platform may feel comfortable, their inflexible elevated form makes walking on uneven surfaces a serious occupational hazard. Vogue writer Liana Satenstein recently revealed that she tore a ligament after one of the many falls she has suffered while wearing flatforms, and in Japan, where they have been popular for many years now, flatform-related accidents are widespread. Watch your step: Flatforms, the popular love child of a flat shoe and a platform, may look pretty sturdy, but their inflexible structure makes them tricky and dangerous to walk in, particularly on uneven surfaces . Yamuna Zake - a yoga instructor who specializes in 'foot fitness' and teaches classes on how to walk elegantly in high heels - suggests that better attention to weight distribution can help wearers master the art of the tricky flatform. 'Distribute your weight from your big toes to little toes so you are never keeping all your weight bearing into one point in your foot,' Ms Zake told Vogue. 'If you keep your weight in your heels, it is easier to keep the ankles from collapsing inward. This keeps the ankles strong and feminine while also preventing swelling.' Flatform fanatics: The clunky, retro-looking shoes have been popular with young starlets of late, frequently sported by Miley Cyrus (left) and Suki Waterhouse (right), who has even designed her own line of them . In vogue: Kate Bosworth wore shiny patent flatforms to this year's Coachella festival (left), while Willow Smith opted for silver lace-ups at last year's BET show (right) Not messing around: Shoe brand Y.R.U. have gone the whole hog with one of their recent designs, the 'Everest Platform,' which retails for $79 (pictured) Origins: Flatforms are a later version of the iconic platform sneakers often worn by The Spice Girls, pictured in 1990 . The flatform concept was first popularized in the 90s - most notably by The Spice Girls, who wore sky-high lace-up versions - although they didn't gain their new high-fashion hybrid name until they came back around in style three years ago. They made another revival on this year's spring 2014 runways, with Tommy Hilfiger and Alice + Olivia among the designers to send them down the catwalk, and they have been spotted on the famous feet of Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, and Willow Smith, to name a few. Suki Waterhouse - British model and current squeeze of Bradley Cooper - has even designed her own range of them for UK brand Superga. Fans of the esteemed flatform, however, would be prudent to watch their step, in order to avoid falling victim - literally - to this current fashion fad.",The flat shoe-platform hybrid is currently popular with stars including Miley Cyrus and Suki Waterhouse .

Passion for racing: The then Princess Elizabeth arrives with her aunt, Mary Princess Royal, for Ascot 1946 . By 1958, the Queen had amassed another seven winners, although that didn't prevent her from celebrating delightedly as her eighth, Restoration, took the honours. A keen racing fan, the Queen's career as a racehorse breeder and owner spans more than 60 years, and began with the handful that she was left by her father George VI. Since then, her horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races, including all five British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby, although she has managed a second place finish with Aureole in 1953 and came third in 2011 with Carlton House. While the Derby has so far eluded her, . the Queen has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the UK, . among them Dunfermline who managed to win both the Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes in 1977, Carozza, who triumphed in the Epsom Oaks in 1957 . and Pall Mall who took the 2,000 Guineas in 1958.

Last year, Royal Ascot was the scene of yet another triumph for the Queen, after her filly Estimate romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot - much to the obvious delight of the monarch. And it seems that this year's event, which opens on Tuesday, could prove just as lucky. 'Oh, I think she absolutely has a chance this year - without any question,' reveals Royal Ascot's head of international racing, Nick Smith. 'She . has a fighting chance of winning the Gold Cup for the second year . running with Estimate but she will also have a couple of other runners.'

Happily, Royal Ascot's head of international racing, Nick Smith, is on hand to offer his tips on sorting the winners from the also-rans. WHAT DOES A WINNER LOOK LIKE? 'Make . sure you get a good look at the horses’ condition in the parade ring. When you’re studying them look for the ones with gleaming summer coats. 'It’s also important that the horse isn’t sweating . so look out for the ones that are calm and relaxed and with what we call . a quiet temperament. 'For many of them this will be the first time . they’ve seen crowds this size so how they behave is important.' WHAT DOES 'THE FORM' MEAN? 'Form . is the term used to describe the past record of any given racehorse. This is usually detailed in the race card next to each horse’s name. 'A . good tip is to see if the horse has won previously over the same . distance and/or ground of the race they are about to run.' HOW DOES GOING AFFECT THE OUTCOME? 'Going . (or the ground) is absolutely fundamental to the outcome of any . given race: Some horses will run on any ground but most horses will . have a preference of either firm or soft conditions. 'When you see the . term ‘good ground’ it means somewhere in between firm and soft.' Winning ways: Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and his wife Princess Haya . WHICH HORSE IS YOUR TIP FOR THE GOLD CUP? 'I . think it will be won by Leading Light whose trainer Aidan O’Brien has a . remarkable record in the race, having won with Yeats four times in the . past. 'Brown Panther, owned by Michael Owen has improved a lot - he’s in . the form of his life at the moment and is a significantly better horse . than last year. 'The Queen’s horse, Estimate, won the race last year, but . this year it’s a much more competitive race.' ARE THERE ANY OUTSIDERS WORTH LOOKING AT? 'There . is a French horse called American Devil which was trained by Eric Libaud and is running in the Diamond Jubilee . Stakes on Saturday. 'He got nominated for Royal Ascot . straight after his recent win at Longchamp the other day, so that in . itself is a real tip.' WHO ARE THE OWNERS TO LOOK FOR? 'Flat . racing is dominated by superpowers. I have tremendous respect for the . Coolmore Syndicate from Ireland and the amount of incredible horses they . have. 'Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum [ruler of Dubai and vice president and prime minister of the UAE] is massively respected - he has been investing in . British racing for 40 years. 'Britain is now seeing patronage . from Saudi Arabia too.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital found that the pill's powerful hormones can temporarily 'age' the reproductive system . Going on the pill could damage a woman’s future fertility - at least temporarily, a new study has revealed. Researchers found that the powerful hormones can ‘age’ the reproductive system, reducing the production of eggs to levels seen in older women, months after coming off the contraceptive. While scientists do not think the phenomenon is permanent, they advise that a woman’s ‘biological clock’ should be measured three months after finishing taking the pill. The link emerged in a study of 833 women between the ages of 19 and 46 years old, who were attending a fertility clinic. Experts measured anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicles (AFC) which are indicators of ‘ovarian reserve’ or fertility. Levels of AMH and AFC were 19 per cent and 16 per cent lower in pill users. In addition, between 19 per cent and 52 per cent less eggs were produced by the women taking part in the study, with the greatest reductions seen in those under 30. Dr Kathrine Birch Petersen, of Copenhagen University Hospital, said: ‘We expected to find an effect of the pill. But during the project we were surprised at the quantified effect on ovarian reserve parameters as defined by anti-Mullerian hormone, antral follicle count and ovarian volume.’ Even after statistical adjustment for age, BMI, smoking and maternal age at menopause, AMH was still up to 30 per cent lower and AFC up to 20 per cent lower in pill users. Dr Birch Petersen presented her results at a meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Munich and said that they suggest measurements of AMH and AFC should be monitored in those taking the pill. Experts have advised that a woman's 'biological clock' should be measured three months after coming off the contraceptive. Most women are able to become pregnant six months after stopping the pill. File picture . Researchers have found that a woman's sex drive is not affected if she meets her partner while she is already taking the pill. However, women do see their sex drive fall if they stop taking the pill during a relationship, according to a study released last month. Researchers from four British universities and Charles University in Prague studied 365 couples. They investigated how sexual aspects of long-term relationships were influenced by women's use of hormonal contraception. Lead researcher Dr Craig Roberts from Stirling's Division of Psychology said: ‘Our findings showed women who had met their partner while taking the pill and were still currently taking it - as well as those who had never used the pill at any point - reported greater sexual satisfaction than those women who had begun or stopped using the pill during the course of the relationship. ‘In other words, the congruence of women's pill use throughout the relationship had a greater influence on sexual satisfaction levels than either simply being on the pill or not being on the pill.’ She said: ‘We do not believe the pill changes the ovaries in any permanent way. 'But we still need to know more about the recovery phase after women stop the pill. ‘The pill is unlikely to change the basal ovarian biology of egg depletion - but it certainly changes the appearance of the ovaries and the secretion of AMH.’ Dr Birch Petersen said women in the pre-conceptional care programme in Copenhagen who have been on the pill ‘are now advised their ovaries may look old with small volume, a few small antral follicles and low levels of AMH'. But she said this may not necessarily reflect their future fertility status. In order to have a more precise measurement of the biological clock’s status and to reassure the pill user about her fertility potential, ovarian reserve assessment – the capacity of the ovary to provide egg cells that are capable of fertilisation - might be repeated three months after stopping the pill. She said that the pill could mask a severely diminished ovarian reserve and this is important to recognise. Most women are able to become pregnant six months after stopping the pill.","Scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital found the contraceptive pill's powerful hormones can ‘age’ the reproductive system .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A new survey of women aged 31 has found the majority would consider freezing their eggs in the interests of their careers or waiting to find the right partner . Nine in 10 women say they would consider freezing their eggs in the interests of furthering their career, or to give them the time to find the perfect partner, new research has revealed. The survey showed almost half of women would consider the move to preserve fertility, while the majority of those taking part supported the treatment. Dr Camille Lallemant and her team at the Princess Anne Hospital's Complete Fertility Centre in Southampton, Hampshire, questioned 973 women of an average age of 31 in the UK and Denmark via an anonymous online survey. Results showed the majority of respondents - 83 per cent - had heard of egg freezing - known as oocyte freezing - and nearly all of them - 99.4 per cent - considered it acceptable for medical reasons, such as before the start of cancer treatment. Almost as many - 89.1 per cent - considered it acceptable in order to delay the start of their family until social and domestic circumstances were more appropriate. And 19 per cent of respondents in the survey said they were actively considering oocyte freezing treatment themselves, with another 27 per cent interested in the technique. Dr Lallemant said: 'Until very recently, no options for preserving fertility in order to delay childbearing existed, but vitrification has revolutionised oocyte freezing and made it effective and convenient. 'However, before the launch of this study, we were still not clear to what extent women were aware of its possibilities and limitations, or of attitudes towards its use or the circumstances in which they might consider it.'

Dr Lallemant added: 'While both our clinics in Southampton and Copenhagen receive many inquiries about options for fertility planning, few women as yet have actually chosen oocyte freezing for this purpose, though we are however seeing growing interest in the technique.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The only child in the world known to suffer from two extremely rare types of blood cancer has died following a year-long battle against the diseases. Lauryn Robinson died at her home in Mold, North Wales, surrounded by her family, on Sunday. A year ago the eight-year-old was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukaemia and Burkitts non-Hodgkins lymphoma - the only child in the world with the forms of leukaemia. Today her parents Emma and Andrew Robinson have paid tribute to their ‘amazing’ daughter. Lauryn Robinson died at her home in Mold, . North Wales, on June 29, after a fight against . lymphoblastic leukaemia and Burkitts non-Hodgkins lymphoma. She is pictured left during her treatment and right, before she was diagnosed with the two rare forms of blood cancer . Her mother said: 'Lauryn was our whole world, she was our best friend. ‘She . was so considerate, thoughtful of others, funny and just an amazing . person. She never followed the crowd; she loved what she loved.’ Lauryn’s . battle began in July last year when she was diagnosed with both acute . lymphoblastic leukaemia and Burkitts non-Hodgkins lymphoma. She . spent 19 weeks undergoing treatment at the Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool . before her parents were told her diseases were remission. In October last year the youngster was allowed to return home. But . two months later, doctors discovered the cancer had returned spreading to form a brain tumour and invading her bone marrow. Lauryn's fight inspired hundreds of donations to various cancer charities and in her last months the eight-year-old met some of her idols, including pop groups the Backstreet Boys and A1. She was a . huge Formula One fan and had been due to meet driver Max Chilton at . Silverstone race circuit in Northamptonshire this week ahead of the . British Grand Prix on Sunday. Her father said: ‘Nurses said to us, within 10 minutes, you just fell in love with Lauryn. ‘A . man at the Backstreet Boys gig we went to felt the same and after talking . to her, he gave up his VIP passes to her and bought her gifts too. People just fell in love with her.’ Lauryn's battle began in July last year when she was diagnosed with the two forms of leukaemia. She spent 19 weeks undergoing treatment at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool (pictured) before entering remission and returning home in October 2013 . Just two months later doctors discovered the . cancer had returned in the form of a brain tumour and was also present . in Lauryn's bone marrow She is pictured left at the age of seven and right, with her school friends . Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is an agressive cancer of the white blood cells. The cells, which usually work together to fight infection and repair and reproduce themselves, divide uncontrollably in the bone marrow but do not mature. This stops the bone marrow from making healthy blood cells and leads to an increased risk of infection. Sufferers can become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells. They can develop bruises and bleeding and feel aches and pains in the limbs. Burkitts non-Hodgkins lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system, made up of organs such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny tubes and they collect and filter out unwanted bacteria, viruses, damaged cells and cancer cells. Fluid in the nodes contains lymphocytes - white blood cells that help the body fight disease - and grow in the bone marrow, where blood cells are made. Lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way. Patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes. If Burkitts lymphoma is in the chest or throat, people can have difficulty swallowing or breathing, whereas if it appears as a lump in the abdomen, it can cause pain, swelling, nausea and diarrhoea. Source: Macmillan.org.uk . Mrs Robinson said: ‘We just had six months of wonderful time together. She’d met A1 twice, met the Backstreet Boys twice. ‘We just had fun with her. 'Lauryn never asked why and the consultants were amazed at just how far she’d come. ‘She was very happy, making us laugh every day and we looked to her for strength.’ Dilwyn Jones, headteacher at Bryn Gwalia, where Lauryn was a pupil, said: ‘There is a darkness that has descended over the Bryn Gwalia community with the sad loss of Lauryn, one of our pupils. 'Our deepest respect and sympathy is with Lauryn’s family and friends at the loss of such a precious child. ‘The children, and indeed the whole school community have struggled to comprehend why someone so young and so special should have to die. ‘Lauryn was filled with life and enjoyed everything entertaining, especially singing and dancing. 'Her favourites were Steps and Backstreet Boys and not forgetting Formula One racing. ‘She was the kindest of children who shared a special bond with a close group of friends. 'They have completed a memory box in school to capture memories and feelings and have written: “We miss you so much, we will never forget you. You will never be replaced, you are the bravest girl in the world.” ‘There is a glimmer of light in the gloom of grief that helps us to remember Lauryn as the brave girl who endured so much in her short life, to remember how we should live in whatever time we have left, with humour, friendship and resilience. ‘This is Lauryn’s legacy and it will live on in those fortunate enough to have known her.’ Lauryn was a huge Formula One fan and had been due to meet driver Max Chilton at Silverstone race circuit in Northamptonshire this week ahead of the British Grand Prix on Sunday.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Hannah Patmore, 14, has been found to be suffering from polymorphic seizure disorder for 12 years. She is pictured with her mother . Doctors have decoded a teenage girl's genetic make up to help reveal what is causing the violent seizures her parents fear could prove fatal. Hannah Patmore, 14, began suffering epileptic fits when she was two years old. For more than a decade doctors have tried to diagnose the teenager's condition to help find a treatment. Specialists now believe they have had a breakthrough, after analysing Hannah's parents' genes. By examining their DNA, experts discovered Hannah suffers a mutation of the SCN2A gene. The condition, which is thought to affect less than 100 children in the UK, means sodium channels in the brain are broken and electric impulses are unable to travel down the nerves, causing epileptic fits. Her family hope the discovery could pave the way for a treatment that could change her life. Ms Patmore’s mother, Alison, 45, a self-employed businesswoman from Whitley Bay, said: ‘Up until the age of two-and-a-half she had no seizures but then she had severe convulsions. ‘A week later they were just coming faster and stronger and that’s when we went to hospital. ‘Dr Rob Forsyth started working on Hannah’s case and for the past 11 years he’s been helping us. The neurologist works at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary. Mrs Patmore said: ‘We’ve been through various medications and the seizures have been quite bad in the past. 'There have been nasty seizures where she’s crashed to the ground and had stitches and lost teeth. ‘We are in the earliest stages of the diagnosis but we’re so grateful for the work of Dr Forsyth and his team.’ Doctors have analysed the genes of Hannah Patmore's (pictured) parents to find that she suffers from a genetic mutation of the SCN2A gene . Ms Patmore, from Wallsend in North Tyneside, needs round-the-clock care and has problems with communications after also being diagnosed with pervasive development delay. Her family, including her father Simon Patmore, 49 and her brother James, 16, live in fear Hannah's condition could prove fatal. 'You live knowing Hannah could have an epileptic fit and fall and that would be her last' - Alison Patmore, Hannah's mother . ‘It’s terrifying when Hannah has a fit and it always will be - you live knowing Hannah could have an epileptic fit and fall and that would be her last. There’s always that fear but that’s the role of a parent,’ Mrs Patmore said. ‘We’ve got incredible support and genetic tests have been coming along for some time. ‘These medics are working with so many people they are able to change people’s lives. They are fabulous neurologists, we couldn’t be in better hands. ‘We are so grateful, our family, and our . external family. We can work anywhere in the country but we couldn’t get . the same support we get here in Newcastle. 'Hannah is an absolute star. I’ve never met such a resilient child who bounces back from everything - this last year she’s been so happy as an individual.’ Hannah Patmore's mother Alison said: ‘It’s terrifying when Hannah has a fit . and it always will be - you live knowing Hannah could have an epileptic . fit and fall and that would be her last. There’s always that fear but . that’s the role of a parent.' They are both pictured left and right . People diagnosed with the disorder have severe epileptic fits and seizures. Patients typically suffer fits before their first birthday. Seizures often occur in clusters for prolonged periods of time and children often have learning difficulties. The condition is thought to affect less than 100 children in the UK. Polymorphic Seizure Disorder is cause by broken sodium channels in the brain that mean electric impulses are unable to travel down the nerves - causing fits. Scientists have now found that Hannah has a genetic mutation of the SCN2A gene. There is currently no medicine to effectively treat or control the condition. Dr Forsyth is trying to raise funds that could help unlock the science behind childhood brain diseases including meningitis, epilepsy and mitochondrial diseases. Some of the illnesses encountered by Dr Forsyth and his team are so rare they have not yet been medically identified. He warned that there is a still a ‘great distance’ between diagnosing Ms Patmore’s condition and developing the correct medication. He said: ‘We’ve known for many years that Hannah clearly has learning problems and bad epilepsy and this is an example of how medical science in this area has been moving forward. ‘We are understanding more and more about epilepsy in children. 'Hannah’s epilepsy is an example of the kind of condition that we in the medical community had not really identified but we are now recognising and finding more often.’","Hannah Patmore, 14, began having epileptic fits when she was two years old .

"By . Liz Hull . Coping with a newborn baby can be tough. So spare a thought for Claire Ormrod – who has had to do it twice in the space of just nine months. Her son and daughter were born in such quick succession that they will even be in the same class at school. But what is just as remarkable is that the babies survived at all – after 26-year-old Miss Ormrod suffered dangerous complications during  both pregnancies. Claire Ormrod (with partner Gareth) has defied medical odds to have two children in eight months. Alice (left) was born on on 6 December 2011, at 25 weeks, and Gareth (right) on September 7, 2012 . Daughter Alice arrived 15 weeks . prematurely, weighing only 1lb 3oz, while Gareth weighed little more at . 2lb when he was born 11 weeks early. So serious were their conditions that . both were in special care units at the same time – but in hospitals 230 . miles apart. Their mother said: ‘I’m just so grateful they are both . still with us.’ Miss Ormrod has three older children – . Molly, seven, Jack, five, and Charlie, two – and was on the . contraceptive pill when she became pregnant with Gareth. She said: ‘I was absolutely petrified . when I found out I was pregnant again. All of my children, apart from . Molly, have been born progressively early, so I convinced myself I was . going to have another very early, premature baby. ‘My GP said I should have a . termination. He said [the pregnancy] would end up killing me and the . baby and that it wouldn’t be fair to put me through it. But I said no.’ Miss Ormrod had been just 25 weeks . into her pregnancy with Alice when she suffered a placental abruption – a . condition where the placenta comes away from the wall of the womb, . which can kill the unborn child. Ms Ormrod and partner Gareth (pictured) already had three older children; Molly, seven; Jack, five and Charlie, two.  All five were conceived in spite of precautions . Miss Ormrod believes that if Alice had . been born days earlier at 24 weeks – the legal limit for an abortion – . medics would not have even tried to save her. Even after the baby was . delivered by emergency Caesarean in December 2011, doctors warned Miss . Ormrod and her partner Gareth Gee, 36, that she was unlikely to survive. Alice had a catalogue of health . problems, including chronic lung disease and heart and bowel defects, . and was put on a ventilator to help her breathe. She also suffered . several life-threatening infections and, at her lowest point, dropped to . 9oz in weight. At the age of ten months, she suffered liver failure, six heart attacks, seizures and brain damage. Doctors told Miss Ormrod and Mr Gee, . who run a martial arts club together, that there was nothing more they . could do. The couple had her baptised, began planning a funeral and were . only 90 minutes from turning off her life support when, against the . odds, she began to respond. Miss Ormrod said: ‘We were having a . final cuddle with her before turning off the life-support machine when . she suddenly woke up, started looking around and moving her arms and . legs. ‘Within 24 hours she was off the life . support, out of intensive care and breathing on her own. The doctors . couldn’t explain it, it was a miracle. She’s such a fighter.’ A month before that, in September, . Gareth had been delivered, also by emergency caesarean after Miss Ormrod . suffered another placental abruption. When baby Alice was born at 25 weeks, she was the smallest baby ever to be born in Wales, weighing just 1lb 3oz, and doctors feared she would not survive . Alice was so ill that her family had started arranging her funeral and gave her a hasty baptism . Doctors have been stunned at the 'medical impossibility' of Alice (pictured) and her brother being born so close together . He spent eight weeks in special care before being allowed home in November. Miss Ormrod, from Rhyl, north Wales, . said: ‘It has been very hard, at one point we were travelling to . Birmingham Children’s Hospital for Alice and Gareth was 230 miles away . in the special care baby unit at Glan Clwyd. The doctors don’t know how . much damage Alice has suffered. She is still fed through a tube in her . stomach, she can’t swallow or sit up, she is like a newborn. Gareth . appears to be fine, he is just a bit small.’ Miss Ormrod, who is waiting for an . operation to be sterilised, added: ‘It will be nice that they are so . close when they are older. ‘Hopefully, they will be in the same class and Gareth will be able to look after his big sister.’ Gareth was born on the cut-off day for . their local Catholic school, Ysgol Mair. If he had arrived just a day . later, he would have been in the year below Alice. Alice is now 13 months old and weighs 12lb 14oz, while Gareth, who is just over four months, weighs 7lb 14oz.","Claire Ormrod, 26, had her daughter Alice on 6 December 2011, at 25 weeks .

"By . Jenny Hope . Access denied: Crizotinib could benefit 1,000 patients a year but is deemed to lack evidence of benefits . A new drug that combats a specific type of lung cancer is too expensive for the NHS, says the rationing watchdog. Crizotinib, which is aimed at patients in their 40s and 50s, halts the advance of the disease for almost eight months – more than double the time for chemotherapy. The drug, which was fast-tracked for use in the US last year, is designed for patients with a specific genetic mutation – non-small cell lung cancer. It is estimated that 1,000 patients could benefit each year from Crizotinib, which costs £4,000 a month. But the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence claims it is unclear how much benefit the drug gives to patients so it is not deemed to be cost-effective. Almost one in seven people with the disease were never smokers or light smokers who gave up, but like all sufferers the cancer is often diagnosed late when it has spread. For three-quarters of all new cases, five-year survival rates are as low as five per cent because the cancer is advanced. Dr Michael Peake, Clinical Lead, National Cancer Intelligence Network, said ‘In an aggressive disease like advanced lung cancer, where, for the majority of patients, survival is exceptionally poor and where not all patients can expect to gain much benefit with existing therapies, there is an urgent need for new medicines like crizotinib which target the specific drivers of a patient’s tumour. ‘Clinicians recognise that the future of cancer treatment lies in these types of targeted medicines. ‘If this preliminary guidance is upheld, it potentially signals a setback to the advancement of cancer medicine in the UK.’ Currently many patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC will have a second round of chemotherapy which threatens hair loss and other side effects - some life-threatening. Rapid help: The new drug halts the advance for non-small cell lung cancer for eight months, more than double the time for chemotherapy . The drug is designed for NSCLC . patients with a specific genetic mutation, of which at least two thirds . of patients respond to crizotinib compared with just a fifth having . chemo, with far fewer side effects. They show a doubling of time on average before the cancer progressed, up from three months to 7.7 months. Around 41,500 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year, including 14 per cent of patients who were never smokers. It is estimated that 1,000 patients could benefit each year from the new drug, which costs just over £4,000 a month. Chemotherapy costs more than £1,000 a month but is being given to hundreds of patients who will get little or no benefit, according to experts. Improving life: The drug is designed for lung cancer patients with a specific genetic mutation, of which at least two thirds of patients respond to crizotinib with far fewer side effects. Dr David Montgomery, Medical Director, Pfizer Oncology UK which makes the drug, said ‘Personalised medicines are developed specifically for selected subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit, sparing those in whom they will have no effect. ‘We believe this approach is better for patients and offers better value for the NHS, a concept in keeping with Nice’s purpose. ‘We are committed to working through the Nice consultation process to address the uncertainties within this preliminary recommendation.’ The drug, has been granted a conditional licence by the EU drug regulatory body because it serves an ‘unmet clinical need’ which is expected shortly to become a full licence. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the UK, accounting for more than a fifth of all cancer deaths.","New drug halts advance of non-small cell lung cancer for eight months .

"By . Jenny Hope . Forget vitamins and exercise – if you want to stave off mental decline try a Sudoku instead, say scientists. A review of various studies on how to preserve brainpower found only a mental workout made a difference in later life. In Britain, around 820,000 people have dementia, most suffering from Alzheimer’s. Puzzles: The research found only mental training, which featured in three trials, showed benefits in memory every time . Some research has found exercise can cut the risk of dementia, while other studies suggest doing crosswords, playing cards or using a computer. But patients and doctors may find the conflicting information confusing, said Dr Raza Naqvi of the University of Toronto, Canada, who led the review. His team looked at 32 trials involving about 25,000 healthy patients aged 65 or older. For the most part, studies of drugs, hormone therapy, vitamins and supplements ginkgo, omega 3 and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) showed no positive effect. With physical activity, the evidence for benefits was ‘weak’, said the review in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. Only mental training, which featured in three trials, showed benefits every time. Dr Naqvi said: ‘In one trial, participants had significantly improved memory during five-year follow-up periods.’ Crossword: Dr Naqvi has called for more research into 'easily accessible tools' to hone mental skills, such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku . In another study, researchers tested people on everyday tasks such as finding a number in a phone book. Those who had done a mental training programme performed better. Dr Naqvi called for more study of ‘easily accessible tools’ to hone mental skills, such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku. And he said it was a case of use it or lose it: ‘I still recommend to my patients to remain mentally and cognitively active as long as possible in whatever way is stimulating.’","Review of studies has found only a mental workout made a difference to memory in later life .

"By . Sophie Borland . Women with breast cancer are being urged to exercise as there is no evidence it worsens painful symptoms, according to the health watchdog. Around 10,000 of those diagnosed with the illness each year on to develop lymphoedema, which leads to pain and loss of mobility in arms and legs. In the past they were urged by doctors to avoid exercise as it was thought to make the condition worse but NICE states this isn't the case. Breast thermogram: Women with breasts cancer are being urged not to give up exercise . Guidelines from the watchdog today state that moderate physical activity such as housework, gardening or walking will also help improve their overall health. In addition, breast cancer is linked to obesity and increasing evidence has found that staying active reduces the chances of the cancer returning. The condition affects 1 in 5 of the 50,500 women diagnosed with breast cancer in Britain a year and occurs when the lymph nodes are damaged by surgery or radiotherapy. Breast cancer is linked to obesity and increasing evidence has found that staying active reduces the chances of the cancer returning . It causes pain in the knees, elbows and other joints and swelling of the limbs which can be extremely severe. In the past, women were advised not to exercise over concerns it worsens symptoms but recent evidence has shown this isn't the case. Breast cancer is also linked to obesity and there is increasing evidence the illness is far more likely to return if women are even mildly overweight. Professor Mark Baker, Director of the NICE’s Centre for Clinical Practice, said: ‘Lymphoedema can have a significant effect on someone’s life, making once routine tasks difficult and painful. ‘It may also have an impact on a person’s self-confidence and mental health depending on how severe the condition is. ‘Our new recommendations make clear the link between exercise and breast cancer-related lymphoedema to help people manage this often distressing condition. ‘Although exercise will not prevent it, evidence shows that it will not cause lymphoedema or make existing symptoms worse either.’ Doctors advise women with lymphodeamia to do stretching exercises and also to stay as active as they can without hurting the affected muscles. They are urged to undertake moderate activity such as housework, gardening and walking but to avoid lifting heavy furniture as this may cause pain in the affected joints. Rachel Rawson, Clinical Nurse Specialist at Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘Lymphoedema after breast cancer treatment can be devastating. ‘It attacks confidence and self-esteem and can reduce a person’s quality of life. ‘Knowing that exercise can be beneficial will give confidence to those living with the condition. ‘Exercise can also help maintain or improve health for anyone diagnosed with breast cancer. ‘Regular movement every day can help keep joints supple and aid lymph drainage and extra exercises can also be useful if swelling restricts movement of the arm.’","In the past women with the disease were told to give up exercise .

"By . Deni Kirkova . The optimum amount is 3-4mg of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight one hour prior to exercise . Many of us rely on our morning cup of coffee to help us feel more alert, but new research says it can actually help us perform better in the gym, too. The caffeine in coffee makes exercise feel easier, improves attention and reduces symptoms of fatigue - and a cup at the right time can help us to exercise harder and for longer. Studies show the optimum amount is 3-4mg of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight one hour prior to exercise. An average mug of instant coffee contains approximately 100mg of caffeine. So for someone who weighs 61kg who wants to consume 3.5mgs of caffeine, that would equal 213.5mgs - or just over two average mugs. This amount of caffeine enables gym bunnies to . perform for 30 per cent longer, while improving alertness and the . ability to sustain motor skills and helping persistence, vigour and . output levels according to a new report from the British Coffee Association. Studies have shown how caffeine improves . endurance and performance in cycling high intensity running, repeated . sprinting and sports such as football and rugby; and some athletes have . said they consume caffeine to enhance their endurance, alertness and . motor skills. These benefits result from the actions of caffeine in the brain where it reduces the chemical messages that normally induce fatigue and stimulates energy production and fat oxidation. However nutrition experts warn of the associated dangers of continued reliance of caffeine for sports. 'Coffee is a proven performance enhancer and weightloss aid, but we do need to be careful' 'The short term effects of caffeine on fatigue, endurance and performance are well established and for many drinking large volumes of coffee and caffeine energy drinks this is the norm,' says Dr Gill Hart, Clinical Biochemist, YorkTest Laboratories (yorktest.com). 'However, there are many negative . effects of caffeine including insomnia, anxiety, headaches, palpitations . and high blood pressure that also come into play. 'High caffeine consumption can also . cause high levels of homocysteine in the blood, raised levels of which . are associated with strokes, heart-attacks, dementia and infertility – . it’s important to not only think about the quick fix but the longer term . on your health too.' Independent . personal trainer Jack Braniff from urbanenergiefitness.com has written . at length about the pros and cons of drinking coffee for fitness on his . website, highlighting many fo Dr Hart's concerns. However he says it's still worth drinking. 'Coffee is a . proven ergogenic (performance enhancer) and weightloss aid, but we do . need to be a little careful. One must exercise prudence when . incorporating coffee into the diet. 'Too . much caffeine causes stress on your adrenal system which can lead to . poor sleep and increased cortisol levels (stress) - and ultimately . weight gain. There are many negative effects of caffeine including insomnia, anxiety and headaches . 'Some people tolerate caffeine better than others, so that's why everyone needs to be careful about how much they're having. 'The recommended daily dose for an average person is 400mg, which equates to around 4 cups of coffee each day; obviously this is dependent on what coffee we're drinking. If we keep within this bracket, we should not experience the associated negative side effects. 'I would recommend drinking coffee for three particular purposes including pre-workout to maximize performance, in the morning to help you wake up, and for general weight loss.' Around 70 . million cups consumed every day in the UK, and contrary to popular . belief exercise lovers who drink it do not necessarily need to . compensate by increasing their intake of water. Recent . research found any diuretic effect of caffeine in a normal cup of . coffee is more than balanced by the amount of water in the drink - . leading to hydration. Recent research from BRITA reveals that 51 per cent of us drink caffeinated drinks during the day, with 55 per cent drinking 3 or more cups of coffee per day. Nutritionist Jo Travers comments: . 'Caffeine is scientifically proven to help you when exercising, however it's an unpredictable substance. When drinking coffee you can't be sure on the amount of caffeine you are ingesting. It's important to stay hydrated with water as it improves performance and helps keep the body running at an optimum temperature. Staying hydrated will also improve your concentration levels, allowing you to get more out of your workout.' The research from BRITA also revealed that 62 per cent of us only drink water when we are really thirsty. 'Getting thirsty is actually one of the very last physical effects dehydration has on the body so the damage may have already begun,' says Jo.

Coffee, when consumed in moderation . (four to five cups of coffee or 400mg of caffeine per day), provides . similar hydrating qualities to water and does not cause dehydration . Mike . Gleeson, exercise biochemistry professor at Loughborough . University, says: 'Studies show that if you consume enough caffeine at . the right time, it can enhance your physical performance. 'New . research shows black instant coffee consumed one hour prior to exercise . can improve endurance performance in a similar way to pure caffeine (of . equivalent amounts), which suggests coffee may be a very effective way . to consume caffeine before exercise.' 'Studies . have found caffeine consumption has a greater effect on physical . performance in those who are recreationally active than in trained . athletes, and can improve cycling, running, and high-intensity sports . such as football and rugby over a 80-90 minute period.' For pregnant women the NHS recommends consuming no more than 200mg of caffeine per day from all sources.","British Coffee Association: Caffeine helps us exercise harder & 30% longer .

"By . Ruth Styles . Elegant in summery pale green and pink florals, the Queen was on typically stylish form as she arrived at a school in London this afternoon and was met by crowds of cheering pupils. The Queen also revealed that she, like the Duchess of Cambridge, is a fan of recycling her outfits, after she arrived in the same Angela Kelly ensemble that she wore to watch the action on day two at Royal Ascot last year. But while this visit didn't have much in the way of horses, there was plenty of sporting action on offer as the Queen was treated to an assured display of fencing as she opened the new sports hall at Westminster School. Summery: The Queen was elegant as she opened Westminster School's new sports hall and watched some of the young fencing enthusiasts in action . All smiles: The Queen beamed as she met pupils at Westminster School and appeared to enjoy the fencing display almost as much as the racing . The Queen, who is scheduled to appear at this year's Royal Ascot which takes place next week, is a regular at the races and was last spotted enjoying the Derby on Saturday after rushing back from Paris. A keen racing fan, the Queen's career as a racehorse breeder and owner spans more than 60 years, and began with the handful that she was left by her father George VI. Since then, her horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races, including all five British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby, although she has managed a second place finish with Aureole in 1953 and came third in 2011 with Carlton House. While the Derby has so far eluded her, the Queen has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the UK, among them Dunfermline who managed to win both the Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes in 1977, Carozza, who triumphed in the Epsom Oaks in 1957 and Pall Mall who took the 2,000 Guineas in 1958.

Last year, the Queen achieved a long cherished ambition when her filly Estimate romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot - much to the obvious delight of the monarch. Her appearance at next week's Royal Ascot will be the latest in a series of engagements, which began last week with the State Opening of Parliament and a state visit to France for the D-Day celebrations. After processing down the Champs-Élysées on Thursday evening, the Queen spent the Friday meeting world leaders and paying her respects to the fallen in Bayeux and on Sword Beach. The following day, she toured the Marche aux Fleurs - now renamed Reine Elizabeth II - before rushing back to the UK just in time to see chestnut three-year-old Australia romp home to victory in the £1.3m Derby.

"By . Emma Innes . Some people eat them, others leave them attached to their newborn for days, now the latest placenta-related fad sees parents turn their child’s placenta into a photo frame. A new graduate has found a way of adding dried and crushed pieces of placenta to moulds filled with clear casting resin to create marble-effect frames, and is already receiving orders from new parents. Amanda Cotton uses the entire placenta to make a frame, first boiling it and then grinding it into small pieces before placing it into a mould with resin. Amanda Cotton (left) has found a way of creating photo frames out of placentas. One of her first clients is Ulrika Jarl (right) who is expecting her second child at Christmas . She said: ‘I have had a lot of positive feedback from mothers and fathers-to-be - and I already have clients.’ One order has come from Ulrika Jarl, who is expecting her second daughter at Christmas, a spokesman for the University of Brighton said. After the birth, Miss Jarl will be keeping the placenta in a cool box for Miss Cotton to collect and turn into a frame. Miss Jarl said: ‘I can understand why some people might find this a bit yucky but what attracted me was the use of materials that we think of as waste. ‘I finished an MA in sustainable design at the University of Brighton a couple of years ago and these issues are close to my heart. ‘We need to think of all waste in a completely new way, as raw materials which hold huge potential. Why not use human waste where possible? Ms Cotton has found a way of adding dried and crushed pieces of placenta to moulds filled with clear casting resin to create the marble-effect frames . Ms Cotton (pictured making a frame) said: 'It is my belief that human by-products have just as valid an aesthetic value as their virginal material resource' ‘I have friends who swear by placenta capsules and say they give them much more energy, more milk and even combat the postpartum blues. ‘You can donate placentas for training dogs to look for human remains. There are so many uses for these useful bits of tissue that kept your baby alive for nine months, yet the majority of placentas are just thrown away. That really is a waste.’ Miss Cotton developed her picture frame technique before graduating this year in 3D materials practice at the Faculty of Arts. She said: ‘It is my belief that human by-products have just as valid an aesthetic value as their virginal material resource. ‘From this starting point, I chose to create souvenirs which pin-point key times in one's life, using materials of personal significance. Ms Cotton is now expanding her range after receiving positive feedback from new parents . ‘I chose the placenta because during my time at Brighton I lived with a midwife and it became apparent through her studies that there was little importance placed on the placenta, even though it is the link between the mother and baby throughout the entire pregnancy. ‘My work is all about our incredible bodies creating materials which we love and care for yet, once separated from us, we are repulsed by and we feel the need to discard then. ‘My work is about expressing the amazing and intricate materials our bodies provide.’ The 25-year-old, who works for a London design company, has said she is expanding the range after receiving positive feedback from parents. She said: ‘It is quite common for people to keep their baby's by-products such as the umbilical cord, first tooth or hair clippings to document their progress, along with photos and notes. ‘The placenta is one of the first creations the mother and baby make together - why not celebrate that with a keepsake?’","Amanda Cotton, 25, adds cooked, crushed, dried pieces of placenta to moulds filled with casting resin to create the picture frames .

"By . Emma Innes . A 24-year-old man is waiting to have surgery after living his entire life with his heart beating just below the skin of his abdomen. Ho Zhiliang was born with congenital cardiac exposure syndrome - a condition which is said to kill more than 90 per cent of patients at birth or shortly afterwards. After Mr Zhiliang was born, his parents were warned he would not live long as his heart was so exposed. Ho Zhiliang's heart is just below the skin in his abdomen. He now needs surgery to move it into his ribcage . They took him home to care for him and, to their amazement, he survived. After he left school, he found a job as a barber and resigned himself to living with the condition. However, earlier this year he read a newspaper article about someone with a similar condition who had undergone surgery to place their heart back in the correct position. So, he gave up his job and moved to Wuhan in the hope of receiving the same surgery. Doctors are currently forming a plan to help him. Mr Zhiliang's parents were told he would not live for long when he was born because his heart is so exposed - they were amazed when he survived . Mr Zhiliang read the story of Huang Rongming, from Henan province in China, who underwent life-changing . surgery to move his heart into his ribcage. He . had lived his entire life with a heart protruding from his abdomen, and . after the surgery, was finally able to walk upright without getting out . of breath or turning blue. Mr Rongming could not afford the . procedure that would place his heart in his chest, but . media coverage of his condition enabled him to undergo the life-changing . operation. He had lived with the rare condition for 24 years until a doctor told him his condition was rapidly deteriorating and that he required urgent surgery. Mr Zhiliang decided he wanted surgery after reading the story of Huang Rongming (pictured), from Henan province in China, who underwent life-changing surgery to move his heart into his ribcage . 'It's a dream come true. I'm going to lead a normal life like everyone else,' he told ChinaDaily before the surgery. Until he had the operation, Mr Rongming's heart could clearly be seen pumping underneath a thin layer of skin and bulging out from his upper belly. The surgery lasted more than 10 hours and was entirely successful. His abdomen is now flat and his heart defect fixed. Mr Rongming said: 'I am now normal, thanks to the many kind souls.'","Ho Zhiliang, 24, has congenital cardiac exposure syndrome .

"By . John Naish . Like many artists, Arthur Ellis paints the things he sees around him. This is why his paintings are inspired by dizzyingly high precipices, towering piles of sofas, cartoon animals and even Victorian dolls that have come to life. But in fact, Arthur is completely blind. The 66-year-old from  Southborough, Kent, lost his sight after a near-fatal bout of meningitis that damaged his optic nerve seven years ago. But instead of experiencing only darkness, he lives amid a vivid world of hallucinatory visions. His illness has left him with a strange, but surprisingly common, condition called Charles Bonnet syndrome. Painting in the dark: Artist Arthur Ellis, 66, from Southborough, Kent, lives amid a vivid world of hallucinatory visions, despite being completely blind . An estimated two million people in Britain experience often bizarre visual hallucinations, according to the Institute of Psychiatry. Often these are caused by Charles Bonnet syndrome, which is named after an 18th-century Swiss scientist and philosopher who identified the condition in his grandfather, who was nearly blind from cataracts. Such visual hallucinations are most commonly are associated with medical conditions affecting the brain or vision, such as Parkinson’s, dementia and the relatively common eye condition, macular degeneration. The latter develops when the macula, the part of the eye responsible for central vision, starts to fail. It is most commonly age-related, and some 460,000 Britons suffer from it — with around one in five of those thought to develop Charles Bonnet syndrome. Another world: One of Mr Ellis's paintings, drawn from his hallucinations after his blindness . When a person suddenly loses his or her sight,  the brain can start to overcompensate for blindness by filling blank spots with stored images. However, because of lack of research so far, relatively little is yet known about the syndrome — let alone how it can be treated. Sufferers and medical professionals can be reluctant to discuss it, for fear that the hallucinations are a sign of insanity. In 2006, Arthur, a divorced father of three grown-up boys, was working in the printing industry. In his spare time, the fine-arts graduate painted portraits and surreal art. But one Saturday morning, he came down with an intense headache. ‘I put up with it for the whole weekend then struggled into work on Monday,’ he remembers. ‘My colleagues took one look at my awful state and sent me to my GP.’ He barely managed to get there before collapsing in the consulting room. Arthur was rushed to an intensive care unit, but lapsed into a coma. ‘I was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis,’ he says. He was put on a life-support machine and his family were warned he’d most probably be left brain-dead. After three weeks, however, Arthur began to rouse. ‘I was in a terrible state,’ he says. But although his sight had gone, Arthur emerged into a strange world of terrifying images and bizarrely cartoonish apparitions. ‘While I was in a neurological rehabilitation unit in hospital, I kept seeing myself on the edge of a precipice like a big, craggy bay. There was the feeling you could just tip off,’ he remembers. The doctors had told him that he was blind, and so he understood this to be a hallucination, but still it was an extremely disturbing visitation. ‘I got my sons to take me from room to room to get away from it, but I just got different views of the same frightening thing. I could also see a dry riverbed below, and felt certain that it would flood and carry me off.’ Arthur feared that he was about to lose his mind entirely. ‘It scared the nurses too,’ he says. ‘One instructed me not to tell anyone about the hallucinations, for fear that I would be sectioned under the Mental Health Act.’ Eventually, a specialist confirmed that Arthur had Charles Bonnet syndrome, as a result of optical nerve damage in his brain. Surreal life: Charles Bonnet sufferers often see grotesque disembodied faces, bizarre figures in elaborate costume, nonsense text and letter strings and extended landscape scenes . It is believed that in such cases, the brain can start to overcompensate for blindness by filling blank spots with stored images. These may be confabulated from life, from film or TV, from books or radio. ‘I know now that I can handle the visions, because I understand that it is my brain playing tricks on me,’ says Arthur. ‘Some of the images I see are really entertaining, like cartoon animals,’ he says. ‘If I wave my arms at them, they even flinch. It is a surreal world. A hallucination of a sofa becomes a flight of stairs and then I see someone standing on the top of them.’ Arthur has spoken to other people with Charles Bonnet syndrome and found remarkable similarities in their hallucinations — such as seeing Victorian dolls coming to life. Many sufferers’ hallucinations can also range from simple patterns and colours to grotesque disembodied faces, bizarre figures in elaborate costume, nonsense text and letter strings and extended landscape scenes. In fact, hallucinations seem to be far more common than most of us would acknowledge. Grief hallucinations, for example, may affect the majority of bereaved people. These ghostly visions of dead partners, friends or pets are often experienced by bereaved people shortly after their loss. A study from the University of Goteburg, Sweden, found that more than 80 per cent of older people experience hallucinations associated with their dead partner one month after the bereavement. The ghosts seemed to be so real that they heard them and spoke to them. The ghostly visits were commonly felt to be a ‘helpful and comforting experience’, said the researchers. One much rarer condition is Lhermitte’s peduncular hallucinosis. This involves bizarre visual hallucinations, such as strange-looking chickens and people attired in odd costumes. The condition is caused by a lesion in a patient’s midbrain, caused either by accident or disease. The hallucinations are believed to occur because the midbrain is associated with the faculty of vision. Despite its relatively widespread nature, Charles Bonnet syndrome remains essentially a medical mystery. Vivid imagination: Arthur suffers from Charles Bonnet syndrome, as a result of the damage in his brain and now makes art from his hallucinations . Now the Institute of Psychiatry, at King’s College London, has launched an in-depth investigation into how it may best be treated. Dr Dominic ffytche, a consultant psychiatrist and expert in visual hallucinations, is joint leader of the £1.9 million initiative. As he explains: ‘Despite the large numbers of people suffering from distressing hallucinations, there is no clear evidence that any treatments actually work.’ He believes this is partly because no one has previously taken an over-arching view of the condition. ‘Depending on whether the hallucinations are a symptom of conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or eye disease, you might be treated by a psychiatrist, neurologist or ophthalmologist, often with very different advice on how there might be any way to treat the condition.’ His project aims to understand more clearly what causes visual hallucinations and identify which treatments work best for which patients. He hopes that this will ultimately improve NHS care. In the meantime, though, sufferers can still be faced by ignorance. Indeed, the Macular Society, a charity campaigning for people with sight loss, has been urging ophthalmologists and opticians to warn patients with the condition that they have at least a 20 per cent chance of developing Charles Bonnet syndrome. ‘It is extraordinary that so many people don’t know about this condition,’ says the charity’s spokeswoman, Cathy Yelf. ‘Sufferers can fear that they are going mad as well as blind. ‘Most people can cope with it well, once they know what is happening to them. But some suffer quite horrifying hallucinations, for no apparent reason. For example, one woman saw her dead husband’s disembodied head on the pillow next to her. Other people see huge snakes or insects.’ For Arthur, though, the hallucinations have positively helped him to find purpose in his life post-blindness. Moreover, he has been able to sell his pictures through professional exhibitions. ‘A lot of my art work is trying to make sense of my Charles Bonnet hallucinations,’ he says. ‘When I left hospital after nine months, I started trying to draw like I used to do. But now it is a different ball game. I cannot now let the pen or pencil leave the paper. If I do, I am lost.’ To get an idea of how his finished paintings look, Arthur relies on feedback from sighted people, including his sons and professional carers who look after him every day. ‘People have told me that my work is inspirational. But I had the drive to do it anyway,’ he says. ‘Before the illness, I had planned to take up painting fully again when I retired. It’s what keeps me going.’ For information on Charles Bonnet Syndrome visit macularsociety.org .","Blind artist Arthur Ellis, 66, paints what 'bizarre visual hallucinations'

"By . Adam Lee-potter . Adam Lee-Potter suffers from gout, picture at his home in Sutton Poyntz, Dorset . My name is Adam and I've got gout. Cue much hilarity and jokes at my expense about port and eating too much pheasant. Through sheer embarrassment I've been lying about my gout for years, but I've finally run out of excuses for my never-far-away hobble. There are only so many skiing accidents, mountain bike crashes  and trodden-on wine glasses any one  43-year-old can feasibly sustain. The normal instinct if you spot someone in obvious pain, unable to endure so much as the weight of a sock on his bulging, hot big toe, is not to double over in amusement. That is, unless it's gout. During one of my regular flare-ups, a colleague on a Sunday newspaper invariably demanded to look at my grotesque ankle - as glossy and red as an apple, heat coming up off it like an old bar heater. Just a glimpse rendered her insensible with laughter. Even alcoholics and drug addicts elicit more sympathy. Gout sufferers - all 1.5 million of us in the UK alone - receive only mockery. This is despite the fact that gout is, say medical experts, the most painful condition known to man. It now affects one in 40 adults in the UK, according to a study published last week by the British Medical Journal, yet it is still widely laughed off as a comedic, self-induced complaint brought on by perceived over-indulgence. The latest study found that between 1997 and 2012 the incidence of gout increased by 29.6 per cent. Although the researchers did not investigate possible causes, rising obesity and alcohol consumption have been blamed. And to be sure, alcohol - beer, chiefly - and red meat (not to mention lentils, broccoli, sashimi and, tragically, Marmite), do aggravate the condition, but they do not necessarily cause it. So little is still really known about gout. A classically unsexy condition, medical research has been woefully under-funded, lacklustre at best. Indeed, no one has yet been able even to explain why men - at a ratio of up to ten to one, though the gulf is closing - are so much more prone to it than women. This knowledge gap perhaps explains why, as the latest study found, two-thirds of British gout sufferers have not yet been prescribed preventative drugs. I suffered my first paralysing attack at just 21 - I was then a supremely fit, clean-living, 12st vegetarian who regularly cycled 100 miles a day. I was trying to walk half-a-mile to the university library one morning with what I assumed was a badly sprained ankle. I managed 100 yards before the throbbing pain brought me to an agonising halt: it felt like my right ankle had not only broken in two, but had then been skewered with a rusty blade smeared with some Russian toxin. I couldn't even get my boot off because of the outrageous swelling. Adam suffered his first paralysing attack at just 21when he was a fit, clean-living, 12st vegetarian . Hopping didn't work - the movement made the pain even worse - so I started crawling home on my hands and knees. At this point, a passing motorist asked if I wanted a lift to the doctor. I was swiftly referred to an orthopaedic specialist - a Harley Street consultant who had once treated the tennis player Jimmy Connors. Gout was not mentioned; no blood tests done. He told me I'd clearly suffered a forgotten sporting injury in my youth and sent me away with a wobble board (a special board you stand on to strengthen your muscles) and some insoles for my shoes. Years passed, with these bizarre attacks getting ever more frequent. By my late 20s, I was experiencing fortnight-long flare-ups twice a year. Sometimes the pain was so excruciating, I couldn't leave my flat for days, having to send friends out to buy industrial amounts of ibuprofen (which I'd stupidly take at three times the maximum dose), plus Nurofen gel, with Deep Heat spray on top. My father - a pathologist who himself developed gout in his 40s - thought it might be tendonitis, an inflamed tendon. I saw another specialist, who suggested surgery - removing a sliver of healthy ankle bone to alleviate supposed pressure from the Achilles tendon. That didn't sound sensible to me. I declined. When an orthopaedic specialist examined him they said Adam had clearly suffered a forgotten sporting injury in his youth. Years passed, with these bizarre attacks getting ever more frequent . Symptoms, as they do, worsened, but it was not until 2004 that, aged 34, gout was finally diagnosed. I'd never been fitter - I'd just done an 18-month, 15,000-mile charity cycle ride around the world - but I was still getting attacks that kept me out of the saddle for days at a time. I had also developed what a clinic in Singapore declared 'bursae', or bursitis - bulging pockets of crunchy fluid hanging off my elbows like water wings - and 'ganglions': bony, marble-sized lumps that studded my knuckles. Back home, I made an appointment with my new GP, in Dorset, who immediately suggested gout, a diagnosis swiftly confirmed by a blood test. Gout - a condition that often runs in families - is caused by the body's inability to break down and excrete purines, compounds found in certain foods. This in turn causes a spike in uric acid, which builds up and forms crystals that gather in a joint, causing inflammation and acute pain. My uric acid level, at 0.72, was way outside the normal range of 0.11 to 0.42. I was torn between relief and embarrassed horror. But why the shame? Diet is a factor, of course. Hence all the rich-living jokes. Certainly, it's true that GP guidelines advise you to moderate or cut your consumption of purine-rich foods - red meat, liver, kidneys, shellfish - as well as sticking to the maximum alcohol units (and drinking wine or cider, rather than beer or spirits). Symptoms, as they do, worsened, but it was not until 2004 that, aged 34, gout was finally diagnosed . There is no doubt the surest way to bring your uric acid level down is medication. Upon my belated diagnosis, I was almost immediately prescribed 300mg of Allopurinol daily - a uric acid-lowering pill I will probably have to take for the rest of my life. My levels were back to normal within a month; the attacks stopped, briefly. The painful bumps on my elbows and knuckles were, however, starting to bother me. I finally persuaded an orthopaedic surgeon to remove the 'ganglions' on my fingers. This was done with a local anaesthetic and I will never forget watching the sweat trickling down his brow as he put his knee up on a London operating table for leverage while he battled to saw through the chalky lumps. The proportion of gout patients thought to develop kidney stones . They were not, in fact, ganglions. Nor did I have bursitis in my elbows. As a result of my gout remaining undiagnosed and rampant for more than ten years, I'd developed chronic tophaceous gout (or tophi): clumps of uric acid crystals stuck in my joints. I now have scars across my knuckles that would not shame a prize fighter, but at least I no longer look as though I'm wearing rings under the skin. My elbows are still baggy but they are slowly deflating, thanks to medication. I still have flare-ups, though. I was driving my daughter to school the other morning - my swollen ankle heavily strapped - when I felt an explosion of wet warmth trickling down my right forearm. I rolled up my sleeve to see what looked like cottage cheese spurting, with arterial force, from a pea-sized hole in my elbow: the rock-hard urate crystals, excited by the latest flare-up, had burst through the skin. Aside from medication, Adam has embraced lifestyle change . I was duly referred to an orthopaedic surgeon - who didn't want to operate - and then to a consultant rheumatologist, who decided drugs were still the answer. Blood tests showed my uric acid levels had inexplicably crept back up. This did seem very unfair. Aside from medication, I have embraced lifestyle change and any alternative remedy thought to help: cherry extract, a daily spoonful of bicarbonate of soda - said to rid the body of uric acid. I even wear a thermal sock on my right foot in bed because uric acid levels rise as your body temperature drops at night. My refusal to quit Marmite notwithstanding, I have forsworn beer, shunned spinach (less of a sacrifice, admittedly) and am now - badgered by my doctor - considering giving up playing squash. For, as with any arthritic condition, while exercise is beneficial, any activity that aggravates your joints can trigger a gout attack. Nonetheless, damage has been done. Uric acid has eaten my ankle away to such an extent that I now also have osteoarthritis. So I still have an on-off limp. But I am now on a hefty, daily 700 mg of Allopurinol - finally, I hope, the correct dosage - which should bring my uric acid down to less than 0.3, a level at which my body should, within two years, be able to absorb my tophi. And at that level there should be no more flare-ups  - scarred fingers crossed. Yet there are potential downsides. As my rheumatologist admitted: 'We'll need to keep a close eye on you. These high levels of Allopurinol could upset your kidneys.' 'By ""upset"", do you actually mean damage?' I asked her. 'Yes,' she admitted. 'At some point, it's either a new ankle or new kidneys. Probably. Sorry.' And - although gout will, I'm sure, always be a tad comic - that's not quite so funny, is it?

"By . Emily Davies . For two years, cerebral palsy sufferer Ben Baddeley dreamt of the life-changing operation that would one day let him play football with his little brother. Then, after the nine-year-old had endured gruelling preparation for the surgery, his dream was shattered by the NHS cancelling the operation just weeks before it was due. His mother Amy had to break the news to him after receiving a letter from Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham which blamed the cancellation on cuts which had made the £20,000 surgery ‘unfundable’ by the NHS.

The NHS have pulled out of funding for an operation Ben needs so the family are trying to raise the £11,400 themselves . ‘When I told him, he was completely devastated,’ Mrs Baddeley said. ‘He loves football. He just wanted to kick a ball with his brother without being in agony.’ Ben had already taught himself to walk, but his disability means it is painful for him and over time his mobility will deteriorate, leaving him wheelchair-bound and unable to play with brother Josh, five. Mrs Baddeley, 29, added: ‘For the past two years, we’ve been told by doctors that Ben was on the list for the operation and we had to prepare for the surgery. When I received that letter I felt like I had let my little boy down.

The family from Silverdale in Staffordshire have been helping Ben prepare for the operation since 2012, and now plan to take legal action against Nottingham University Hospitals Trust . Ahead of the . surgery, Ben had already undergone an hour-long MRI scan under general . anaesthetic and had stopped his regular Botox injections which help ease . his muscle stiffness. When families were made aware of the cuts earlier this year, the NHS promised to honour any operations that had been given a date. Ben’s pre-operation baclofen procedure, which helps with muscle spasms, had been booked but because his final surgery had not been scheduled, the trust cancelled the first procedure – leaving the family to foot the bill for both that and the main operation on the nerves in his spine. Mrs Baddeley and her husband Gary, a 37-year-old welder, now need to raise £11,400 for the operation to be done privately. James Hunter, clinical director for the musculoskeletal directorate at Nottingham University Hospitals, said: ‘We have been in contact with parents of children referred to NUH to inform them we will not be proceeding with any further pre-operative tests. ‘It would be unfair on these children and their families for us to continue a process which may not result in surgery.’ Around 5,400 gastric bypasses and 1,300 gastric band procedures are performed by the NHS each year, while in 2012 it spent £3.5million on 790 breast implant operations. n To help Ben, visit www.justgiving.com/yimby/benpainfreeforlife .","Ben Baddeley had endured gruelling preparation for the surgery .
