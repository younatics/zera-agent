"Blow: Canadian Environment Minister Peter Kent announced his country was withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol last night . Canada has abandoned the Kyoto Protocol on climate change as it bids to protect the third largest oil reserves in the world. Environment minister Peter Kent said Canada was invoking the legal right to withdraw and would be saving the country $14billion in penalties for not achieving its Kyoto targets. The Conservative government is reluctant to hurt Canada's booming oil sands sector - which holds more than 170 billion barrels - with daily production expected to more than double by 2025. Canada becomes the first nation to formally renounce the protocol, although Japan and Russia have also indicated they would not accept new Kyoto commitments after the protocol expires at the end of 2012. Mr Kent said: 'The Kyoto Protocol does not cover the world's largest two emitters - the U.S. and China - and therefore cannot work. 'It's now clear that Kyoto is not the path forward to a global solution to climate change. If anything it's an impediment. 'To meet the targets under Kyoto for 2012 would be the equivalent of either removing every car, truck, ATV, tractor, ambulance, police car and vehicle of every kind from Canadian roads or closing down the entire farming and agriculture sector and cutting heat to every home, office, hospital, factory and building in Canada.' Currently, Canada produces 1.5million barrels from the oil sands a day. Only Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have more reserves. Critics say the enormous amount of energy and water needed in the extraction process increases greenhouse gas emissions, meaning Canada will only be more likely to fall foul of the carbon dioxide targets in the future. There is also the possibility that further global warming could make it easier to extract the oil in hard-to-access areas where the Arctic conditions make it difficult to drill or strip out. Target: The protocol required 37 countries to commit to reducing their greenhouse gas output to 1990 levels by the end of next year (file picture) Mr Kent's announcement comes a day after marathon climate talks finished in the South African city of Durban. Negotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed on a deal that sets the world on a path to sign a new climate treaty by 2015 to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires at the end of next year. Canada's previous Liberal government signed the accord, but current prime minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government has never accepted it. The accord requires countries to give a year's notice to withdraw. Much heralded: Then prime minister Jean Chretien received a standing ovation after the protocol was ratified in 2002. Kyoto did not include the U.S. or China . The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997 in Japan and ratified by most major countries except the U.S. and China. It only came into force in February, 2005. It committed 37 industrialised nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels and provided financial help to developing countries to accomplish the task. Although Canada ratified the accord, it was not on track to meet its targets as emissions climbed while the economy expanded. The protocol will continue to be in effect until the end of 2012, despite Canada quitting. While many city authorities in Canada approved the decision, others accused the government of destabilising future action on global warming. Greenpeace Canada spokesman Mike Hudema said in a written statement the Harper government 'has imposed a death sentence on many of the world's most vulnerable populations by pulling out of Kyoto'. He added: 'This is a further signal that the Harper government is more concerned about protecting polluters than people.' New Democratic Party environment critic Megan Leslie said the costs for Canada to say in Koyoto were 'absolutely made up'. She told CBCNews: 'What this is really about is the fact that our government is abdicating its international obligations. 'It's like we're the kid who's failing the class so we have to drop it before that happens.'","Canada becomes first nation to renounce protocol against global warming .

"Steve Bruce admits Hull missed out on a gem when they pulled out of a deal to sign Charlie Austin in 2013. Bruce had lined up the striker, then with Burnley, following the Tigers' promotion to the Barclays Premier League. The move appeared to be well advanced, with a £4.5million fee attached, until a medical highlighted concerns over a knee issue. Charlie Austin could have been facing his current club if his move to Hull City hadn't fallen through . Bruce tried to sign the striker when he was playing at Burnley but he failed a medical due to a knee problem . That condition had not troubled Austin before and has not surfaced since, with QPR being rewarded for stepping in to sign the player after Hull demurred. Austin scored 20 times last season as Rangers won promotion from the Championship and has excelled in the top flight this term, netting 13 times to date. Bruce welcomes Austin to the KC Stadium on Saturday as Hull face QPR in an important game for both sides' survival prospects, and there will be a tinge of regret that he is not donning the black and amber. 'Our loss is QPR's gain,' said Bruce. The Hull City boss would have loved to be able to pick Austin in his side for Saturday's game with QPR . 'Not only has he done as much as anyone this year but last season he scored the goals that got them into the Premier League. That is what he was brought in to do. 'It is never easy to score goals. We are all looking for someone like that. He has got 13 and that is a healthy return with 13 games to go. 'We'd identified him. I think he would have been a real terrific player for us, as he has proved. He is a goalscorer with a fantastic attitude.' That Austin has not suffered any significant knee problems since Hull passed on him resonates with Bruce, who had a similar problem before joining Manchester United only for Sir Alex Ferguson to sign him anyway to great success. The striker was in training with his team-mates this week in preparation for the crucial clash at the KC . 'Going back 30 years, I failed my medical with a knee injury I didn't know I had, at Manchester United,' said Bruce. 'They signed me on my playing record and the belief that I'd never had a bad knee. 'It went back to something when I was a kid, at the age of 12. Incredible.The sad thing (for Austin) is he probably never knew he had a funny knee, or something wrong with his knee.'","Steve Bruce nearly signed Charlie Austin when he was playing for Burnley .

"Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet insists he does not feel the pressure which comes with the scrutiny of virtually each one of his performances. The Belgium international was dropped in December after a run of shaky displays but since returning on Boxing Day - somewhat fortuitously after deputy Brad Jones' was injured - he has looked a different player. He has kept six clean sheets in 13 matches since returning to the side, and the two he conceded in Tuesday's midweek win over Tottenham were the first conceded from open play since New Year's Day. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet (right) celebrates beating Tottenham on Tuesday with his team-mates . 'Day in, day out you are in the spotlight but the main job is to focus on the football,' he said. 'You are always going to be under pressure but it is our job and you get used to it. 'It is not really pressure, it is something you enjoy as everyone likes to play in front of a big crowd. 'The last few weeks have gone really well so we have to continue in the same manner. 'We are still battling on all fronts: we have the FA Cup this weekend and then there is the Europa League and so there is still a lot to play for.' Mignolet, attempting to save Harry Kane's strike at Anfield, has made six clean sheets in his last 13 games . The Belgian, working hard on crosses during a training session on Thursday, was dropped in December . While Mignolet is comfortable being in the spotlight for his goalkeeping he is less so when it comes to his non-football activities. The Belgian, along with Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling, is the star of a new television advert after the club announced NIVEA MEN had signed a multi-year agreement to become their official grooming partner. As a result, at the launch event at Anfield, he had to field questions about his pre-match grooming routine. 'Before every game I have a cold shower to wake me up,' was the extent of his response. He found it easier explaining how he coped with the big-match pressure. The 26-year-old has been in impressive form since returning to the Liverpool side on Boxing Day last year . 'As a goalkeeper especially you have to prepare yourself mentally so I try to keep the same routine from the night before to kick-off,' he added. 'You prepare yourself in the same way and if you get a certain routine it makes it easier as well.' Raheem Sterling, who has yet to sign an 'incredible' new contract being offered by the club, revealed he had taken up yoga to help with dealing with all the focus of being one of the hottest young talents in Europe. It is not going as expected for the winger. 'I've started yoga but it is nothing like I thought it would be,' he said. Mignolet will face competition for the No 1 jersey from Brad Jones (second left) who has returned to training . 'They've got me doing press-ups and stuff like that - I thought it was more for meditation.' Henderson, as the principal player in the television advert, was asked whether he could rival Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart - who has a high-profile shampoo contract - in the Premier League modelling stakes. 'I'd probably have to work on my acting skills a bit, I think Harty has got that down to a tee,' said the Reds vice-captain. Mignolet was speaking at an event to announce NIVEA MEN, the world's number one men's skin care brand, has become the official men's grooming partner for Liverpool Football Club.","Simon Mignolet has kept six clean sheets in his last 13 Liverpool matches .

"Sunderland boss Gus Poyet is determined to give his star men the freedom to fashion another famous victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday. Poyet limps into the game on the back of a dismal goalless draw with West Brom last week and an FA Cup defeat at Bradford which raised some speculation over his future at the Stadium of Light. But the Uruguayan has been buoyed by the memory of Sebastian Larsson's winner in last season's corresponding fixture as part of a four-game winning streak which sealed their unlikely survival bid. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet says he will unleash his attacking players at Manchester United on Saturday . Sebastian Larsson (number seven) is congratulated by team-mates after scoring against United last season . Poyet said: 'You cannot make (Jermain) Defoe, (Ricky) Alvarez or (Adam) Johnson become robots and do what you want all the time. They have to have the freedom to go forward and express themselves. 'I think the mix has to be right - it is not perfect at the moment but we are still working on it.' Sunderland's win at Old Trafford last year was their first since 1968 and Poyet believes that factor could work to the Black Cats' advantage as they seek to find the momentum to escape their latest relegation battle. Poyet added: 'It is true that there is something different when you don't win for years and years in a place and you go there and it looks like it is going to be more difficult than ever, and we did change that. 'I think that is going to bring something different to the players - at least those who have been here a while.' Larsson fends off pressure from West Brom captain Darren Fletcher during the draw at the Stadium of Light . Sunderland winger Adam Johnson takes on West Brom midfielder Chris brunt before drilling in a cross . Jermain Defoe skips out of the way of Brunt's challenge during Sunderland's draw with West Brom . But Poyet warned the extent of United's current travails have been greatly exaggerated and believes Louis Van Gaal's men are still on course for a top-four finish. United's surprise defeat at Swansea last weekend heaped more pressure on the Dutchman in light of recent questions over his style of play since arriving to replace David Moyes last summer. Poyet said: 'I think it is going to be a totally different game - nothing compared to last year when Ryan Giggs was their caretaker and we were playing for our lives. 'Now they are in the process of changing their style of play - for a team that has been playing for 20-plus years in the same way it is going to be a difficult process. 'I think people are being a little bit harsh on Manchester United at the moment. They are not as bad as people think because they are in a good position, and if they get in the top four a few people are going to have to recognise they have done better than people expected.' Poyet suffered a blow this week with the news that Italian striker Emanuele Giaccherini is almost certain to miss the remainder of the season after undergoing ankle surgery. But his squad is otherwise nearing full fitness with only Billy Jones and Jack Rodwell struggling for the Old Trafford trip, and more likely to be rested with a view to returning for Tuesday night's crucial trip to Hull. Despite their shock 2-1 loss to Swansea, Poyet insists that Manchester United should not be underestimated .

"Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew has called on fans to use social media to name and shame anyone caught throwing coins following incidents during the club's last two home games against Newcastle and Liverpool. The Eagles will upgrade their security measures this weekend for the visit of Arsenal in the hope that they can put a halt to the incidents seen in the last fortnight. As well as more cameras situated around the ground, some stewards will wear body cameras in attempt to get a clearer view of potential culprits. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew has called on the club's supporters to name and shame via social media . Newcastle players celebrate their opener at Selhurst Park as Fabricio Coloccini is struck in the face . Crystal Palace have vowed to ban anyone found guilty of throwing coins from the ground for life . Coloccini played the full 90 minutes in the 1-1 draw but John Carver raged he could have been blinded . And Pardew insists that fans should upload pictures of rule-breakers to social media. 'The incident with Chelsea in Paris gives you the strength of social media. So if any fans are next to someone [behaving inappropriately] then film them. Let's have a picture of them and we'll try and do our best to find them. 'We represent society at all levels, we get all types of our society here and we can't control their behaviour to a degree. 'All we can do is put on the best environment and most children-friendly environment we possibly can. We've got the best atmosphere in the country and we don't want to lose that with silly little incidents that have come, and I don't want to keep going on about it. 'Those few citizens that are letting us down, we need to reel them in and point them out to us.' The south London club have launched investigations in two separate incidents of objects being thrown onto the pitch. Coloccini points to the coin thrown at him (left) as Papiss Cisse celebrates his 10th goal of the season . Stewards look for any objects thrown on to the pitch at Selhurst Park as one finds a coin on the turf . The first saw Newcastle defender Fabricio Collocini hit with a coin during the 1-1 draw last week as the Magpies celebrated going ahead, the second occurred after Daniel Sturridge equalised for Liverpool in last Saturday's FA Cup tie. And the Eagles have invested in upgrading their CCTV equipment following the incidents that marred both matches ahead of Saturday's visit of Arsenal. The club are also exploring tactical security measures they can take when opposition scores to prevent further incidents. One official shows his colleague the coin having found the object that was thrown at Coloccini . Newcastle head coach Carver was fuming after the incident involving his skipper .","Crystal Palace have launched investigations in two separate incidents of objects being thrown on to the pitch .

"Do you call a long sandwich of cold cuts a sub, a hoagie, or . a hero? A slew of new maps prove how you answer this, and a load of other . questions, can betray where in America you come from. The regional differences in America are apparent to anyone . who has traveled even a state or two from their home, but some differences in . dialect aren’t as obvious—or as well known—as others. But North Carolina State University doctoral student in . statistics took the data compiled from 120-question survey by Cambridge professor . Dr. Bert Vaux that asked American’s questions like how they pronounce ‘lawyer’ or ‘crayon’ or what exactly they call that cold cut sandwich and turned it all . into fascinating maps that show just how dialectically divided the country . really is. How ya'll doin'? North Carolina State University Ph.D. student Joshua Katz created over 100 maps using data about regional American dialect differences. How do you describe groups of two or more? Cole-d shoulder: Can you just call coleslaw slaw? Again, the north and south are divided. And in the south, you put 'slaw' on your sandwiches (and even, in some places, on your hot dogs) Sticky issue: Caramel has two A's, but do you pronounce them both? only if you live in the south and east coast . Katz was kind enough to share several of these maps with Business Insider, and those interested can peruse a great many others, as Katz . has also made all 100+ maps available online. The most obvious example of where American regions part ways . dialectically is in, to use the survey’s verbiage, ‘what word(s) they use to . address a group of two or more people?’ Axe to grinder: While most of America says 'Sub' for a long cold cut sandwich, some say hoagie, hero, or even--though it's managed to stay off this map--grinder . How do I pronounce thee? Cambridge researcher Dr. Bert Vaux, on whose data Katz based his maps, found that Americans pronounce 'pecan' in one of four ways, depending on where they come from . Moving to the City: New Yorkers, and MTV reality show fans, may take issue with this, but 'the City' apparently also means Chicago or Boston . Is your name Ben? If so, Wisconsin may be a confusing place because in the Badger State, your name rhymes with 'been.' Other ways to pronounce it include 'bin' in most other country and 'bean' in British tourist destinations . If your answer is ‘ya’ll,’ then chances are very good you . were raised south of the Mason-Dixon line. Other responses included ‘you all,’ used mostly in Kentucky and a chunk of central Florida, and you guys, which is . basically used everywhere else. Not included in the map is the uniquely Pittsburgh . alternative ‘yinz guys.’ Just say PJs: Nearly following the 'Ya'll Line' is the pajama line. Southerners and a few folks in the northeast call their jammies 'puh-jaaahmas' while the rest of the country prefers their nightwear to be 'puh-jam-uhs' Or is it parkway? Debate rages about whether that 'big road you drive fast on' is a freeway or a highway, with westcoasters leading toward freeway . Is your lawyer loyal? Regardless, if the first syllables of the words sound the same to you, you're probably not from the south, where lawyer rhymes with callyer . Mary me Merry and we'll be Marry: If you hear this sentence and it makes sense, you're like most of America. But in some regions, people pronounce each word differently . A less obvious example is the word ‘caramel.’ Though sweet, . preference for how to pronounce the sugary treat seems to create a bitter . divide according to Katz’s map. Travelers to Montana be warned: the state . reported the most who pronounce it ‘carm-uhl,’ without the second ‘a.’ Crayon jewels: 'Cray-un,' 'cray-awn,' 'cran,' or 'crown,' they all mean crayon . Fifty fifty: About half the country calls the eggy dressing man-aise, while the others prefer the extra zip in the middle, calling it may-uh-naise . Circular logic: Only in New England are rotaries more than those volunteer retirees with tents at fairs--they're traffic circles in most of the country, while Utah calls them roundabouts . Other questions include the perennial favorite ‘pop’ or ‘soda,’ how to pronounce ‘pecan,’ and the question that will annoy every Louisianan who . reads the maps, ‘What do you call the miniature lobster the one finds in lakes . and streams?’ Dying dialect? Only Rhode Islanders and folks from half of Wisconsin seem to use the rare colloquialism of 'bubbler' when referring to drinking fountains. Or are they water fountains? What gives soda its pop? Long an indicator of one's Midwestern roots, a 'sweetened carbonated beverage' is probably a 'pop' if you're from the Plains states but a soda if you're from the coasts . What's stuck in your crawfish: Those from New Orleans, where the tiny lobsters are a delicacy, might take issue with the alternatives 'crayfish' and 'crawdad' David Booey? If the spelling and pronunciation of the rock star's name have never added up for you, you're from Texas or a town called Bowie, pronounced Booey, outside Washington, DC . Katz’s interest in creating these maps seems to personal. He . is, after all, a statistician not a linguist by trade and he’d love to work . with Dr. Vaux on another project sometime. ‘I’ve always found variations in dialect fascinating ,’ he . told the NC State University blog The Abstract. ‘Language says so much about . who a person is. To me, dialect is a badge of pride – it’s something that says, . “This is who I am; this is where I come from.”’ Suuuurup: Most of the country opts for the pronunciation 'sirup' but others put 'searup' on their pancakes (or are they flapjacks?) What if I'm playing racquetball?: The term tennis shoes describes rubber-soled athletic shoes to most Americans. But In the northeast, where they're more often called 'sneakers' We have no idea: Respondents outside eastern Virginia seemed confused when asked what they call drive-thru liquor stores. But residents of the region call them 'brew thrus' Violent weather? When its raining, but the sun is still shining, a small area in the deep south refers to the phenomenon as 'the devil beating his wife'",A North Carolina State University doctoral student's fascination with differences in U.S. dialects led him to create over 100 maps that show the colorful ways in which American English diverges .
"Mauricio Pochettino will leave no room for sentiment when solving his goalkeeping dilemma for Tottenham's Capital One Cup final against Chelsea. Michael Vorm has started all of Tottenham's games on their charge to Wembley, but Pochettino must balance that loyalty against the risks of leaving Hugo Lloris, one of the world's finest goalkeepers, on the bench.

"A 10-year-old boy was suspended after he pretended to shoot an imaginary bow and arrow at his classmate, the family's attorney said this week. Johnny Jones was disciplined after he playfully responded to his friend's imaginary gun duel during class in October, by making an imaginary bow and arrow using his pencil. Johnny was reported by a girl in his class at the South Eastern School District West in Pennsylvania. Johnny Jones, 10, was suspended from South Eastern School District West in Pennsylvania for shooting an imaginary bow and arrow in October . Following a lecture by their teacher, Johnny and the other boy were suspended for one day under the school district's zero-tolerance policy against weapons and their school records marked to say they had violated it. MailOnline was awaiting a response from Principal John Horton and Superintendent Dr Rona Kaufmann at the school. The parents of Johnny Jones are considering legal action and want their son's school record expunged. The family's attorney John Whitehead, from the Rutherford Institute, said today: 'We all want to keep the schools safe, but I’d far prefer to see something credible done about actual threats, rather than this ongoing, senseless targeting of imaginary horseplay.' The Rutherford Institute has asked that the school remove the incident from the ten-year-old's permanent record. The school district has until Friday to make a decision on the incident. According to the South Eastern School District’s Zero Tolerance policy for 'Weapons, Ammunition and other Hazardous Items' the school bans possession of guns, knives and other instruments that can be used to harm. It also bans students from carrying replica or lookalike weapons - but makes no mention of the imaginary.

"Dan Ashworth thinks Harry Kane will become an even better striker if he plays for England at the European Under-21 Championship this summer. Two years ago Kane was going through a miserable loan spell at Norwich, but given his recent form, it would not be a surprise if he scored the winner for Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday. Kane has scored 24 goals for Spurs this term and is almost certain to earn his first senior England call-up in three weeks' time. Harry Kane strikes a penalty against West Ham, which led to his 14th Premier League goal of the season . Kane's excellent form, including two goals against Chelsea, makes it likely he will get an England call-up . This June England's youngsters travel to the Czech Republic for the Under-21 championships. Seniors manager Roy Hodgson has told Under-21 coach Gareth Southgate he can pick any eligible senior player and Ashworth thinks Kane would profit from the experience of playing in the youth tournament - even though he is likely to be a full international by then. 'It's the best eight teams in Europe, and it's the next big international tournament to a senior one,' said FA technical director Ashworth. 'There are pressures, there are challenges of international football that can't always be replicated in club football and it's the nearest thing he's going to get to hopefully going on and winning something for England seniors as well. It would be immensely beneficial for him and any other player going. There are concerns about over-playing Kane, who was rested for Thursday's Europa League defeat . Kane has already played 10 times for the under-21 side, and will be eligible for the European championships . Kane has scored eight times for Gareth Southgate's side, and Dan Ashworth wants him to stick with them . 'I'm sure Gareth would love to have him going with the 21s.' Kane has been a regular in Southgate's team since he took over from Stuart Pearce as Young Lions coach. Pearce left his post after guiding the team through a dismal Euros two years ago. England lost all three group stage matches and failed to score from open play. Ashworth is optimistic about the team's chances of success this time around though, thanks partly to Kane's form and that of Saido Berahino, who topped the scoring charts in qualifying with 10 goals in 10 appearances. The likes of Raheem Sterling (left) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are also eligible for the young lions . Several senior players like Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and Phil Jones are also eligible for selection, but Ashworth concedes Southgate will have to take a pragmatic approach to squad selection. 'It's our duty as a national association to try and get our best players and most appropriate players to go to every single tournament,' said Ashworth, who was West Brom technical director before joining the Football Association. 'We want to win it. That's important to me and it's important to us. 'That's not necessarily at the expense of ruining a relationship with a club or a player that's played consecutively for three successive seasons and has never had a summer break.'","Harry Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season .

"Chelsea will probably know by now that they called it wrong. They were on trial as much as Christian Eriksen when one of Europe’s most hyped young talents turned up in Cobham as a 14-year-old for the first of two visits. It might just sting Jose Mourinho on Sunday that neither side quite fancied the other, Chelsea thinking the boy ‘too weak’, to quote the player’s father, and Eriksen himself ruling that the club’s academy set-up was not as embracing or enticing as that offered by Ajax. What an intriguing quirk of fate that scrawny Eriksen grew into a player more than capable of dictating how this Capital One Cup final will be won. Christian Eriksen was one of Tottenham's few bright performers in their Europa League defeat by Fiorentina . The Denmark international has revealed he was rejected by Chelsea as a 14-year-old trialist . Eriksen eventually chose to join the youth academy at Ajax before going on to star for the first team . The Dane will have an important part to play when Tottenham face Chelsea in Sunday's Capital One Cup final . ‘England was not my first choice at that age,’ Eriksen admitted this week, recalling the trips from Odense to London, first at 14 and then 15 for games against Millwall and West Ham. ‘I enjoyed myself but it was too big a step at that time. In England you can’t enter the training ground without permission whereas in Denmark you are free to go in. Ajax was a lot closer to home and it meant my mum could come over for my first month. It was an easy decision.’ He signed for Ajax at 16 and joined Tottenham as an £11million player in 2013. In the wider scheme of the club’s spending in recent years, he might just be the best of the lot. He is the playmaker in the tight spaces, an attacking midfielder with enough sense of purpose that he has scored 16 goals in 51 Premier League games. As Spurs flopped out of Europe on Thursday, Eriksen still managed to look good. The talented playmaker has netted nine Premier League goals from midfield this season . Mauricio Pochettino (right) wants to instil the same winning mentality that Jose Mourinho has at Chelsea . If Harry Kane is to follow Eriksen in succeeding in a second season, he will need some of the latter’s resistance to expectations. As a talented Dane born to an ambitious father in Laudrup country, pressure is something Eriksen had to deal with from the start. That was vividly illustrated last October when, following a defeat for Denmark against Portugal, the national manager Morten Olsen hammered Eriksen in the press. The gist was that Eriksen, 22 then, ought to be controlling a game featuring Cristiano Ronaldo. ‘He said it publicly and also told me personally,’ Eriksen said. ‘Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. I think it helped and it didn’t hurt. I’ve grown up with that. My dad was a coach for me when I was seven to 13. He was a footballer as well, so he knew what he wanted. When I had a bad game, he would tell me to do better. ‘There were times when I closed my door pretty hard after I spoke to him. And then the day after, it’s a new day. It’s football. I’ve learned to live with pressure. In the Danish newspapers the comparisons were with (Michael) Laudrup, so of course that started early.’ Eriksen was publicly criticised by Denmark coach Morten Olsen (right) for his performance against Portugal . Eriksen has been impressed by the breakthrough made by leading scorer Harry Kane (left) this season . Andros Townsend (right) celebrates scoring during Tottenham's 5-3 victory over Chelsea in January . Pressure is a fascinating topic at Tottenham. Mauricio Pochettino has spoken frequently of the need to develop a winning mentality, given the team’s dreadful run of results against the bigger clubs. The test for Kane will also come from maintaining what has been a sensational season. Eriksen said: ‘What Harry’s doing is impressive. But again, you always have the pressure from outside. Now if he doesn’t score he will feel it straight away. But Harry is a worker as well. He works for the team. He is not a striker who waits for the ball.’ The challenge now is for Tottenham’s two leading outfield forces to take on a fresher, stronger Chelsea side. The 5-3 home win over Mourinho’s side in January is still fresh in the mind. ‘We showed that we can beat them,’ Eriksen said. Now Eriksen must show Chelsea what they might have won. * Eriksen was speaking at a Tottenham Hotspur Foundation event highlighting the Education and Football Development Centre programme, which provides academy-standard coaching alongside BTEC and FA level qualifications to create life-changing opportunities for young people aged 16-18 not in education, employment or training.

"Bobbi Kristina Brown has been taken off her ventilator and her breathing tube removed as her condition remains unchanged at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, according to a family source. USA Today reports that the 21-year-old has been given a tracheotomy to help her continue to breathe. The decision to remove her tube does not mean her family has made a decision about her life support, the source told the newspaper. Family on Thursday said Brown's condition is 'still critical' and that the surgical procedure - which opens an airway into the trachea through the neck - was a normal one for coma patients. 'The tracheotomy is a different place for the tube to go,' the source told PEOPLE. 'Everything else remains the same. It's a waiting game. The family is hoping and waiting.' According to the source, the procedure will also reduce the risk of infection. Proceure: Bobbi Kristina Brown has been given a tracheotomy as the 21-year-old's condition remains unchanged at a Emory University Hospital in Atlanta . 'She is still critical and we don't know what the outcome will be,' the source said. 'No one is giving up on this kid.' Meanwhile, who that family source is, exactly, remains unclear as Bobbi's father Bobbi Brown claims the relatives who have been giving media interviews about her medical condition do not have direct knowledge of her treatment. Singer Bobby Brown's attorney asked media outlets on February 13 to stop speaking with family members unauthorized to discuss the condition of his daughter. She was found face down and unresponsive in a bathtub at her suburban home last month. 'She is still critical and we don't know what the outcome will be,' a family source said. 'No one is giving up on this kid.' Few details about the aspiring 21-year-old singer's condition have been made public. Family members have said she is fighting for her life. 'We continue to request privacy in this matter,' Bobby Brown said in a statement. 'We thank everyone that supports Bobbi Kristina and God is hearing our prayers.' Bobby Brown's attorney said the relatives giving interviews about Bobbi Kristina Brown are not in communication with her doctors, and in particular asked media organizations to disregard cousin, Jerod Brown. The cousin said in an interview with Atlanta TV station WXIA this week that she remained on a ventilator and the family had no plans to remove her from life support. 'This is a criminal investigation and we do not need this side show,' attorney Christopher Brown, who is representing Bobbi Kristina's father, said in a statement. Jerod Brown was also involved in disputed reports that Nick Gordon, who calls himself the husband of Bobbi Kristina Brown, cannot visit her at the hospital. Lawyers for Gordon said the cousin's contention that Gordon was pursuing legal action to gain access to Brown was false. They said Gordon, who has kept a low profile since Bobbi Kristina Brown was rushed to a hospital, only wants to see her recover. 'He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon,' lawyers Randy Kessler and Joe Habachy said in a statement on Thursday. Division: Bob Brown, pictured at the weekend after visiting his daughter, has issued a public denial that Nick Gordon was married to his daughter. He also says the family member giving information to the press is not authorized to do so . 'Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.' Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Whitney Houston, a six-time Grammy Award-winner who battled substance abuse, drowned in a hotel bathtub in Beverly Hills, California, in February 2012. Authorities said cocaine use and heart disease contributed to her death at age 48. Police in Roswell, Georgia, are investigating the circumstances leading to Brown's discovery in the tub on January 31. She had been in a car crash four days earlier, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said. The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said, and one of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out. Critical: Family on Thursday said Brown's condition is 'still critical' and that the surgical procedure--which opens an airway into the trachea through the neck--was a normal one .","The hole placed in her throat will allow Brown to continue breathing and lower the risk posed from infection, family says .
Her condition remains unchanged, however, and is still listed as critical .

"Sam 'Sonny' Bryant says he's as old as he feels. Feel him, though, and you'll never guess his age. That's because the iron-pumping pensioner has pecks that men half his age would only dream of. His biceps are bulging and his legs are like logs of oak. And the only pills he takes are his vitamins. At 70 years old, Sonny is a champion bodybuilder from Georgia ... and he has no plans of hanging up his singlet just yet. 'People ask me when I'm going to retire,' he says. 'I say ""never"". More people die retired than people do working. I love to work, I love to work out. I've been doing this for 27 years.' Scroll down for video . Iron-pumping pensioner: Sam 'Sonny' Bryant, Jr. says he's only as old as he feels. Feel him and you'll never guess his age . Is this the body of a 70-year-old? Sonny started bodybuilding when he was 44 years old . Sonny works the graveyard shift at personal-care emporium Kimberly-Clark as a forklift driver and works out twice a day to maintain the body that has won him more titles and trophies than he can count. He started out aged 44 when going to the gym seemed the perfect way to let off steam when his second marriage began to fall apart. He says he'd never lifted a weight before in his life but soon got the knack and entered his first competition just 11 months later in Columbus, Georgia. He arrived with the wrong outfit – a red, white and blue Speedo – and says he had no idea how to pose. 'The judge called out for a pose, and I had to see what everybody else was doing,' he told the Chronicle. Against the odds, he came third in the novice competition and fourth in the master competition. Now he can deadlift 425lbs with out a grunt. Let off steam: He started out 27 years ago when going to the gym seemed the perfect way to let off steam when his marriage began to fall apart . 'I was just like a crack addict - I was hooked,' he told Augusta.Chronicle.com. 'I had two trophies, never having won anything before. 'People say it's age that makes you old, but I believe it's your state of mind that makes you old. Age is just a number. 'It gives most people a reason to be lazy and not do anything. I meet a lot of people who say, ""wait til I get to that age"". 'Then I tell them how old I am and they are embarrassed. And I tell them that to make a point - it's inactivity and their state of mind that makes them old.' 'I'm like a crack addict': He says he'd never lifted a weight before in his life but soon got the knack and became hooked instantly . Prize-lifter: He entered his first competition just 11 months later in Columbus, Georgia, and came third in the novice contest and fourth in the masters' showdown . Bryant’s diet typically is a dry waffle or scrambled eggs with well-done bacon at Waffle House after he gets off work at 6 am. He then heads straight for Gold’s Gym on Walton Way Extension an hour later. Born in 1943, Sonny is one of seven children. His father worked in the chalk mines while his mother was a maid and school bus driver. After his graduation in 1964, he married his childhood sweetheart and joined the army. But the marriage could not withstand the long periods he spent away serving his country and soon broke down. 'Age is just a number': He says it isn't age that makes you old, but your state of mind that makes you old . He has a strong philosophy: 'If you start thinking you're old subconsciously, your conscious mind is going to take hold of that and your body is going to start acting old, feeling old. Then you're old' After seven years in the forces, he was medically discharged for blistering feet and moved to Chicago where he worked as a restaurant manager, a factory worker and an office cleaner. Upon his return to Augusta, he began working at the Vet­erans Admin­istration medical center as a nursing assistant where he met his second wife whose father was a patient there. But in 1986, she dropped the bombshell that she wanted a divorce. That was when he turned to bodybuilding. But he didn't give up on his hunt for nuptial bliss and married for a third time in the late 1990s. He says he never loved her like a wife, however, and they divorced in 2005. From then on, his relationship with his body grew. How does he manage to stay so fit? He has a philosophy as strong as his bicep: 'If you start thinking you're old subconsciously, your conscious mind is going to take hold of that and your body is going to start acting old, feeling old. Then you're old. 'I don't believe it. I'll dance all night - but that's just me.' And he has a message for the couch potatoes out there too. 'I want people to recognise what I'm doing and realise that it can be done,' he says. 'They can do it. 'A lot of young guys, they go home, sit around, watch TV and do nothing - I've seen a lot of young guys who are older than me. 'I can't sit around too long. I hate it. I've got to be busy.'","Sam 'Sonny' Bryant, Jr., grom Georgia, has been bodybuilding for 27 years .

"'The most hated man on the Internet' is about to get his comeuppance. Hunter Moore, the self-proclaimed king of ‘revenge porn’ who gained notoriety by posting online stolen nude photos has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges of hacking and identity theft. According to court papers filed Wednesday in Los Angeles federal court, 28-year-old Hunter Moore, of Woodland, now faces a sentence of two to seven years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine  as part of the plea deal. Moore was dubbed the ‘most hated man on the Internet’ for sharing X-rated images and personal information about the people portrayed in them on his now-defunct site, IsAnyoneUp.com. Downfall: Hunter Moore, 28, the self-described king of revenge porn, has agreed to plead guilty to hacking and identity theft charges. Moore is facing up to seven years in federal prison . The term ‘revenge porn’ was coined because many of the images were posted by jilted lovers to get even with former partners. Prosecutors said Moore, who once bragged that he was a ‘life-ruiner,’ also sought out racy content himself, enlisting a hacker to dig up nude photos from email accounts. Photos posted between 2010 and 2012 included an American Idol finalist, the daughter of a major Republican donor and a woman in a wheelchair, according to a 2012 article in Rolling Stone magazine. Moore acknowledged in the agreement with the prosecution that he paid Charles Evens to hack email accounts and steal photos. Evens, 26, of Los Angeles, pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial next month. Both Moore and Evans were arrested in January 2014 in an FBI sting operation. According to an indictment, on multiple occasions, Moore paid Evens to break into email accounts and steal nude photos. In an October 2011 email, authorities say that Moore wrote to Evens that 'they needed to create new e-mail accounts and delete evidence of the hacking scheme.' In other e-mails to Evens, Moore allegedly instructed him to 'hack more' and 'hack all week for me,' presumably referring to hacking into email accounts in search of nude photos. Moore is due in court February 25 for a sentencing hearing, although U.S. attorney's office spokesman Thom Mrozek said the proceeding could be postponed until March. Revenge porn has drawn the attention of lawmakers in several states who have passed legislation intended to stop the practice. Vile trade: Moore, pictured here DJing a party in 2913, was dubbed the ‘most hated man on the Internet’ for sharing X-rated images and personal information about the people portrayed in them on his now-defunct site, IsAnyoneUp.com . 'Life-ruiner': Prosecutors said Moore sought out racy content himself, enlisting a hacker to dig up nude photos from email accounts . Prosecutors have brought a number of criminal cases against operators of revenge porn sites, some of whom have charged women to have their photos deleted. Another revenge porn site Kevin Boellart, of San Diego, was convicted earlier this month of state charges of identity theft and extortion. He faces up to 20 years in prison. In 2013, California Governor Jerry Brown signed the first law in the nation specifically targeting revenge porn. New Jersey has an older law that allows prosecution of revenge porn, but it was passed as a far-reaching cyber-bullying statute. A revenge porn bill passed by Arizona lawmakers was put on hold last year by a federal judge after a rights group argued the legislation was too broad.","Hunter Moore, operator of now-defunct site IsAnyoneUp.com, will plead guilty to charges of hacking and identity theft .

"Tory Cabinet Minister Sajid Javid was accused of hypocrisy last night after it emerged that a huge bonus he received as a £3 million-a-year City banker was channelled through a  tax haven. Mr Javid, 45, was promoted to Culture Secretary earlier this month from his berth as a Treasury Minister, where he was highly critical of City tax-avoidance schemes. But an investigation by The Mail on Sunday has established that when he was a high-flying executive at Deutsche Bank, Mr Javid was among a group of senior staff who were paid bonuses worth at least £50,000 each through shares in a Cayman Islands company – to lower the company’s total tax bill. Bonus row: Culture Secretary Sajid Javid with his wife Laura . Accountants said the scheme would have allowed both the bank and its staff to make tax savings. Bank insiders said the scheme was intended to benefit staff rather than the bank. Mr Javid, a protege of Chancellor George Osborne who has been tipped as a future  Tory leader, was promoted to the position of Culture Secretary following the resignation of Maria Miller over her expenses. During his 18-month tenure at the Treasury, Mr Javid spearheaded the Government’s drive to stamp out tax-dodging, declaring that the Treasury was ‘closing down all avenues for tax avoidance, whether it is companies or individuals’. ‘We have to be very strong on tax avoidance and Britain is leading the way,’ he said. He joined Deutsche in 2000, rising to become managing director in 2004, before relocating to Singapore as its head of private equity business. He left the bank in 2009 during the global financial crisis, and won the safe Tory seat of Bromsgrove in the following year’s General Election. Under the plan, top bankers at Deutsche were approached in late 2003 asking if they wanted to have their bonuses paid through a Cayman Islands company. Around 300 staff returned an application form volunteering to take part. The scheme enabled staff to receive more of their bonuses than they would have done if paid in cash, court papers reveal. If a banker was due to receive a bonus of £100,000, after tax the amount received would fall to £60,000 – the remainder would have been paid as tax at 40 per cent tax. On top of that the bank would have to pay £12,000 for National Insurance contributions. Under the Deutsche scheme, the bank could put in £100,000, the banker would receive £100,000, and no NI payments were due. The system exploited a loophole in tax rules that meant if bankers were paid in special shares – called ‘restricted securities’ – no tax was due. Instead of taking all their bonus in cash, bankers were given the option to take part of it in shares in a Cayman Islands company called Dark Blue Investments, set up by another investment bank, Investec. The shares could not be sold for at least two months. When they were sold, bankers would have had to pay capital gains tax – amounting to just 10 per cent if the shares were held for two years or more. But no other tax was payable by the individuals. Bankers who volunteered for the scheme could take a maximum of 90 per cent of their total bonus in shares. Some of the bonuses were worth over £2 million. HMRC has not pursued any individuals in the case, but instead is demanding £49 million from Deutsche in income tax and NI it claims the bank should have paid on to the taxman. This month Deutsche won the right to appeal against an initial decision in favour of HMRC. The bank said it  was ‘pleased’ with the  Appeal Court’s decision but declined to comment further. Top bankers at Deutsche were approached in late 2003 asking if they wanted to have their bonuses paid in the form of ‘restricted’ shares in a Cayman Islands-based company. Javid was one of 300 who returned an application form volunteering to take part. According to the rules in place at the time, the shares attracted only a 10 per cent capital gains tax bill rather than income tax and National Insurance contributions. At the height of his career  at Deutsche, Mr Javid was  earning an estimated £3 million a year, of which a substantial proportion was in the form of bonuses. He would have to have been paid a minimum of £50,000 in bonuses in 2003 to take part in the Cayman Islands tax scheme. Two years ago, a tax tribunal ruled that the ‘carefully planned’ £50 million scheme was invalid because Deutsche effectively controlled the offshore firm, and ordered the bank to repay the money to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. Deutsche appealed against the ruling and the case is still going through the courts. Last night, Labour’s Shadow Treasury Minister Cathy Jamieson said: ‘Sajid Javid claimed when he was at the Treasury to be very focused on tax avoidance. Now we learn there are accusations that he himself signed up for a scheme whereby bonuses were paid through questionable arrangements whilst a senior banker at Deutsche Bank. ‘The public facing a cost of living crisis won’t take kindly to any double standards. ‘Sajid Javid needs to make absolutely clear what he knew about this scheme, what his reasons for agreeing to be involved were and whether he himself or his employer profited from the arrangements in respect of his own bonuses.’ Mr Javid – the son of a Pakistani bus driver who grew up with his parents and four siblings in a two-bedroom flat, but who now lives with his wife Laura and four children in a £4 million home in Fulham, West London – is the first Asian  Secretary of State. His electorally powerful rags-to-riches story, and his closeness to Mr Osborne, have combined to turn him into the fastest-rising political talent in the Conservative Party. A spokesman for Mr Javid said: ‘This is a matter between Deutsche Bank and HMRC. Sajid was paid with all tax deducted already. ‘Sajid did not personally receive any tax advantage whatsoever from these arrangements.’","Sajid Javid received huge bonus when he worked as a City banker .

"A right-wing news website wrote an article last week, implying that Lena Dunham had sexually abused her little sister . Writer and actress Lena Dunham has hit back at a right-wing news website, which published an article accusing her of sexually abusing her little sister Grace when they were children. Website Truth Revolt referenced an excerpt from the Girls star and creator's recently released book of non-fiction essays in which she talked about looking at her sister's vagina when Dunham was 7 and Grace was just a year old. In 'Not That Kind of Girl' Dunham writes about her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, teaching her about female reproductive organs. Seven-year-old Lena then asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers. 'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds . 'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me,' Dunham writes . 'Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked. 'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!” 'My mother didn’t bother asking why I had opened Grace’s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things I did. 'She just on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.' Scroll down for video . Sister, sister: The actress hit back at the Truth Revolt for turning her personal essay about childhood curiosity into something dark and disturbing. Pictured above with her sister Grace (left) at the première of her independent film Tiny Furniture in November, 2010 . Truth Revolt called the described incident 'unsettling' and 'disturbing' but Dunham says it was normal behaviour for a young child learning about the human anatomy. The article reads: 'Lena Dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister Grace, whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “anything a sexual predator might do.” In one particularly unsettling passage, Dunham experimented with her six-year younger sister’s vagina.' They also originally wrote that Dunham was 17 at the time of the incident, and later added a correction saying 'This article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing Dunham's age as seventeen'. Obviously upset with being named as a child molester, Dunham took to Twitter on Saturday to lash out at Truth Revolt for their damaging article three days after it was published. The website has refused to apologize for the article, and it still appears prominently on their home page. Dunham is currently in London to support the launch of her book. The fourth season of Girls is set to première on HBO next year.","Website Truth Revolt cited a excerpt from Dunham's book, in which she describes looking at her then year-old sister's vagina when she was 7 .

Ackerberg to comply with easements, or public rights of way, on her . property. Ackerberg sued the commission in . 2009 in an attempt to overturn a cease-and-desist order it had filed to . force her to clear the easements. Broken promises: Ackerberg had agreed to provide a public pathway to the beach as a condition of a development permit the family received in the 1980s that allowed them to build a mansion, three-car garage, tennis courts and pool .

In Ackerberg's case, she had been fighting two easements dating from the 1980s that provided for beach access on her property. She had put up several impediments that blocked the easements, including large boulders, a fence, a wall and a tennis court. A 2011 order from a California Superior Court judge required her to clear the right of way, but Ackerberg appealed the decision. Late last year, the state Supreme Court declined to hear the case. ‘Although the Commission and I disagreed for several years about the meaning of the terms of the permits governing my property, I am pleased that the matter has been resolved,’ Ackerberg said in a press release. She also said she was pleased the access would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, ‘something of great importance to me and my late husband.’ Famous neighbors: The exclusive Carbon Beach has been home to actors .

A lawyer for Ackerberg, David Codell, referred a caller back to her statement in the press release. ‘It's unfortunate that so much time, and so many resources had to be wasted over the last decade trying to get the public their rightful access to the beach,’ said Mary Shallenberger, chairwoman of the Coastal Commission. ‘But this is an outcome we can all feel proud of, and we are grateful to Mrs Ackerberg for stepping forward and doing the right thing for the people of California.’ The dispute echoes record mogul Geffen's long battle to prevent use of a walkway on his property along the same stretch of Malibu beach. In 1983, Geffen agreed to allow a pathway to Carbon Beach when he sought permits for a pool and other additions, but he later filed suit to fight the access. In 2005, Geffen settled the suit and allowed the public to use the walkway.","Carbon Beach is a 1.5 mile stretch of sandy, exclusive luxury and has been home to heavy hitters like David Geffen, John Travolta, Courtney Cox, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Paul Allen, and Joel Silver .

Now the embattled star wants his fellow comic to know he's thankful for the support. 'I am very appreciative of Eddie and I applaud his actions,' Cosby said through his spokesman Thursday. Eddie Murphy said he made his decision because 'he didn't want to kick a man when he's down'. Scroll down for video .

Murphy, making his return to SNL for the first time in 30 years, had been asked by writers to play Cosby, who is facing a string of allegations of sexually assaulting several women during the height of his fame. Saturday Night Live writer Norm MacDonald told his 507,000 followers on Twitter that he wanted Murphy to play Cosby in a sketch on the anniversary show. According to MacDonald: 'The iconic doors would open and on to home base would step Eddie Murphy. The audience would know what to do. 'Why is Eddie wearing a multi-colored sweater? He steps behind the bar, begins mixing a drink. The audience covers the fact he has not spoken. 'When he speaks, he is Cosby. Eddie Murphy doing a perfect Cosby impression. The audience does not let him finish. The sketch ends.' But Murphy said he was uncomfortable playing Cosby. According to MacDonald, he hoped Murphy would step in and play Cosby until the show was about to go live. Bill Cosby, pictured, is facing allegations that he assaulted several women at the height of his fame . Already that night, the producers were fretting that Bill Murray was not going to take part in the show as he was playing golf. Murray subsequently appeared in a sketch singing the Jaws theme tune.

"Investigation: Michael McIndoe, who is said to have recruited fellow football players into the investment venture he said was run by City financiers . As many as 100 footballers may have been taken in by an alleged investment fraud which fleeced them of a staggering total of £30million, it is claimed today. The players, including former top-flight stars Robbie Keane and Jimmy Bullard, are said to have been lured in by promises of big returns before the scheme imploded under the weight of its debts. Detectives are now probing alleged links to gambling on football matches, the Sunday People reports. Police told the paper they believe it's the biggest swindle to ever hit British football. A source close to the investigation was quoted as saying: 'In all, footballers are thought to have handed over up to £30million to those behind the scheme.' The alleged scam was reported to the National Fraud Bureau last year and police are understood to be probing former footballer Michael McIndoe, who is said to have recruited fellow players into the investment venture. The 35-year-old, who played midfield for Coventry, Wolves and Scotland, went bankrupt in October, the Sunday People says, with disclosed debts of £3million - a figure the paper says experts described as 'the tip of the iceberg'. 'The money lost has been astronomical,' an unnamed source close to the case told reporters Matthew Drake and Dan Warburton. 'The £3million mentioned in his insolvency papers is a very conservative figure. 'It could be up to £15million once all the money is traced.' McIndoe is alleged to have enticed his footballing peers into the scheme - said to have been run by City financiers - with promises of returns of up to 20 per cent on their investments. At least one line of investigation is that the failed fund may have in fact been a kind of Ponzi scheme, a type of scam in which early investors' returns are taken from the cash paid in by subsequent victims. Such schemes always inevitably collapse, leaving all but the earliest investors out of pocket, but not before their operators are able to ride a gravy train of continual cash flow. News of the investigation follows the surprise appearance of former Fulham midfielder Jimmy Bullard on reality television programme I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. At the time his place in the programme was revealed in November, reports claimed his appearance was down to monetary concerns that a thirst for publicity, after he lost £625,000 on the investment scheme. Bullard, who at the height of his earning power took home £45,000 a week at Hull, pocketed around £100,000 for his appearance Down Under as he tried to recoup some cash sunk in the scheme. The 36-year-old reportedly told a friend he had 'been done out of a lot of money'. Ireland legend Robbie Keane, left, lost 'a fortune' when the investment scheme collapsed. Former Fulham midfielder Jimmy Bullard went  on a reality TV programme, right, to repair his finances after losing £625,000 . Ireland and Spurs legend Robbie Keane, now of U.S. club LA Galaxy, was said to have lost 'a fortune'. Another player who asked not to be named, but who revealed he had played with McIndoe in the past, told the People he had lost £100,000. Other alleged victims included players from lower league's and one individual who invested £60,000 inheritance bequeathed to him as a teenager. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'An allegation of fraud was made to Westminster CID in February. An investigation is ongoing. There has been no arrest.' McIndoe proved difficult to track down. A call to the accountancy firm where several of his businesses were registered went unanswered. Named after one of the most notorious conmen in US history, the Ponzi scheme is an elaborate version of the oldest scam of them all - pyramid selling. In its classic form, a Ponzi fraudster sets up a fund with a 'fail-safe' business plan. Investors join in their droves, lured by the huge returns on offer. But the fraudster will merely pay off old investors with new money that comes into the fund. Eventually, all Ponzi schemes are doomed to collapse under the weight of new money flooding in. The fraud was named after Charles Ponzi, an Italian who emigrated to America in 1903 with $2.50 in his pocket. After a spell in prison for fraud, he set up an investment scheme to exploit differences in the price of postage stamps in Italy and the U.S. At the height of his success in 1920, Ponzi was making $250,000 a day - a mammoth sum for the era. When his scheme collapsed, Ponzi pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to five years in a federal prison. Investigators in the case of Michael McIndoe's failed investment programme are exploring the possibility it may have been a Ponzi scheme .","Players said to have been lured in by promised returns of 20 per cent .

"John Carver insists boardroom intervention did not play a part in the U-turn which has seen cancer-survivor Jonas Gutierrez return to Newcastle’s first-team squad. The head coach said last week that the 31-year-old was not ready to play Barclays Premier League football having been given the all-clear from testicular for the second time in November. Gutierrez responded to those comments by declaring earlier this week that it was down to the club’s board – owner Mike Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley – as to whether he played again. Jonas Gutierrez (right) will return to the Newcastle first team again after overcoming testicular cancer . John Carver revealed on Thursday that the winger will be involved when Aston Villa visit St James’ Park . The winger’s situation is complicated by a clause in his contract – which expires in the summer – stating that eight appearances this season triggers a one-year extension. Newcastle allowed him to return to Argentina earlier this month for talks with former club Velez Sarsfield, only for those to break down at the last minute. But now the Magpies say Gutierrez is fit enough to rejoin the senior set-up and will take his place on the bench for the first time in 15 months when they entertain Aston Villa on Saturday. ‘I know all the rumours have been out there about whether it’s Mike or Lee’s decision, but let me tell you, and let me put the record straight, I’ve had no conversations with either of them about Jonas, because I’m the one who picks the team,’ said Carver when pressed on Gutierrez’s claims. ‘I will be the one who decides if he is ready for it, and he is ready to go on the bench now. ‘He was just assuming that (the board were responsible). I don’t know why he said what he did but we’ve had the conversation now and I’ve put the record straight. Gutierrez in training with Newcastle on Thursday in preparation for their weekend match with Aston Villa . Newcastle's manager insisted the board have no say when it comes to picking the team . ‘He obviously thinks that they’re making the decision, but it’s me, it’s my decision and it was a decision based on football alone.’ Politics aside, Gutierrez will be afforded an emotional welcome should he emerge from the bench. And Carver believes his presence can lift a team whose season is in danger of petering out. ‘Listen, I’m telling you now, when we announce the team at the weekend and our fans hear that Jonas is on the bench, can you imagine the feeling in the stadium?’ he said. ‘There is going to be a feel-good factor.’ Carver added: ‘To actually come back and play in the Premier League again would be magnificent. He’s had a hard fight. Gutierrez, pictured here in August 2013, has not played for Newcastle since the 2013-14 season . Carver takes a training session ahead of the visit of Tim Sherwood's Aston Villa on Saturday . ‘When I first saw him (in December) I was really concerned, but I suppose that’s natural because he has come from a serious illness. ‘Over the weeks he has got fitter and stronger. Yesterday, more than any other, I have seen the old Jonas Gutierrez, and that was the first time I’ve seen that.’ Gutierrez will almost certainly be released by United at the end of the season, seven years after signing from Real Mallorca. But Carver has not closed the door on a new deal. ‘He’s been fighting his illness and also fighting for his career. In those terms it’s an important time for him,’ he said. ‘How long has he got left? Three months? So every opportunity he gets he’ll want to prove a point. Whether that is to us about getting a new contract, or whether it’s to go somewhere else. ‘That determination could be what drives him forward, but it could also help us.’","Jonas Gutierrez will be on the bench against Aston Villa on Saturday .

"Paris continues to be a source of joie de vivre for Warren Gatland as Wales secured a fourth successive victory over France to keep alive their RBS 6 Nations hopes. The local papers identified Leigh Halfpenny as ‘La Menace’ of the Welsh team and the boy from Gorseinon provided the kicks that proved the difference. Gatland missed his side’s victory in the French capital two years ago but the Kiwi travelled back across the Channel with his side building momentum and still in for a late charge for the championship . Leigh Halfpenny was key for Wales with his kicking, and he scored all six of their points in a tight first half before adding nine in the second . Dan Biggar (second right) is congratulated by Scott Baldwin after scoring the opening try for Wales in the second half at the Stade de France . The hosts started well with a crunching tackle on Liam Williams and a clinical turnover by Eddy Ben Arous, but Wales were undeterred. The visitors attacked the gain-line, with Jamie Roberts making hard yards off No 10, and played through 11 phases before Halfpenny was awarded a kickable penalty to open the scoring in the seventh minute. Les Bleus’ play had revolved around crash-ball merchant Mathieu Bastareaud but by naming the 19st 12lb centre on the bench, Philippe Saint-Andre had signalled a wider and more open approach. It was a chance for Remi Lamerat, who has been identified by Racing Metro as a potential replacement for Roberts, but he lasted just 18 minutes and, as Camille Lopez lined up a kick to level the scores, Bastareaud was given a rousing reception by the sell-out crowd. Wales knew that a powerful start would silence the Parisian audience and a scuffed 25th-minute penalty by Lopez was a let-off. Assisted by a defence-splitting kick from Davies, Wales were able to clear their lines and move play into opposition territory. The scrum looked unconvincing on a churning pitch but, with the skills of Toby Faletau at the base, still provided a platform to attack. Rather than crash through the middle, the ball went out wide to George North off first phase and France conceded a penalty at the subsequent breakdown. With his usual pinpoint accuracy, Halfpenny took full advantage of the three points. It was advantage Wales but, with Bastereaud playing a key role in the French phases, they almost struck straight back. Yoann Huget finished clinically in the corner, but his score was chalked off for a forward pass.

They attacked the Welsh line through Wesley Fofana, but again left empty handed after play was called back for crossing. Wales fell foul of the law soon after when Alun-Wyn Jones failed to roll away from the tackle and France drew level with Lopez’s kick. When France collapsed a driving maul, Halfpenny was able to edge his team back in front with the kick.

"Well, it’s a start but it was not exactly a performance to strike fear into the hearts of the leading contenders for this World Cup. For now England will be relieved to have finally got off the mark in this tournament here at the Hagley Oval and avoided the fierce opprobrium that defeat by Scotland would have inevitably brought. Yet deep down they will surely know that there will have to be a vast improvement on this 119-run victory if they are to ensure they get out of their group let alone become credible challengers for their first 50-over trophy. Moeen Ali salutes the crowd after his excellent century which gave England the platform to win . Moeen took the game to the Scots, playing aggressively while those around him floundered in Christchurch . England will be relieved to have finally got off the mark at the 2015 Cricket World Cup at the Hagley Oval . Moeen of England celebrates with his team-mates during the 119-run win over Scotland in Christchurch . Moeen receives the player of the match award for his performance against the Scots . On the face of it a score of 303 for eight followed by a bowling display that restricted the Scots to 184 should represent a job fairly well done. It is just that, with the exception of an excellent all-round performance from Moeen Ali, too few England players could be satisfied with their contribution. Specifically, England must look at how they let a score in excess of 350 slip out of their fingers when they were perfectly placed at 172 without loss from 30 overs to inflict carnage on their neighbours. Moeen should be exempt from criticism. First he played with class and an improved shot selection to hit his second one-day international century and dominate England’s largest opening partnership in any World Cup. Then he again showed that he is a worthy first-choice spinner by taking two wickets, including the crucial one of Kyle Coetzer who had given the Group A minnows a glimmer of hope with his 71. Other than that this was a display from England that betrayed the nerves and anxiety that are perhaps inevitable after the sheer scale of their defeats by two of the strongest teams in the tournament in Australia and New Zealand. Too many batsmen appeared to be playing with a fear of failure when they had the perfect platform and opposition accommodating enough to have put on a show worthy of the aggressive intent they have vowed to produce. Instead a tone was set by Ian Bell, who looked curiously out of touch after starting this tour in such vintage form that it appeared incredible he had been missing from the top of England’s one-day order for so long. Here Bell limped along to 54 from 85 balls and was only rescued by the fluency and style displayed at the other end by Moeen, who passed 50 for the first time in 12 one-day internationals and went on to hit five sixes in his 128. For a while it seemed that Moeen was destined to race past Robin Smith’s long-standing record England one-day score of 167 and had he done so then his team would surely have got close to 400 against a modest Scotland attack. Kyle Coetzer led the fightback for Scotland with an impressive 71 but they fell well short in the end . Steven Finn (left) celebrates taking a wicket in a much-improved bowling display against Scotland . Moeen should be exempt from criticism after his impressive showing for England against Scotland . After starring with the bat Moeen was also influential with the ball, finishing with two wickets for 47 . Ian Bell limped along to 54 from 85 balls and looked out of knick throughout on a good batting wicket . Bell stumbles after being hit on the pads, and he never really got going, despite scoring a half-century . But once Moeen fell inertia gripped England, not least when they could manage just 22 for the loss of two wickets in their batting powerplay. Gary Ballance, in particular, will worry England. He has done little to justify his last-minute inclusion at the expense of Ravi Bopara ahead of this World Cup and looked rusty in falling for his third score of 10 in three matches. At least captain Eoin Morgan looked something like his old self as he hit 46 off 42 balls including two sixes of his own, only falling in a disappointing climax to the England innings along with Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes. The memory of Ireland chasing down 328 against England in the last World Cup was fresh enough to provide some apprehension in the break but the fact is Scotland did not have sufficient quality in their batting to threaten. Freddie Coleman gets up high to pull the ball down but Scotland's batting never really got on top of the chase . Joe Root (right) celebrates removing Scotland captain Preston Mommsen to end a dangerous partnership . Scotland's Matt Machan dives to stop the ball as Scotland responded well to England's big opening stand . Scotland have never won a World Cup game and for all their pre-match bombast aimed at turning up the heat on England it would be a surprise if they break their duck here, even against Afghanistan. At least Coetzer gave them respectability against an England attack who were relieved that they had no-one of the calibre of Aaron Finch or Brendon McCullum to bowl at. Not least Steven Finn, who was retained by England ahead of Chris Jordan and James Tredwell despite being demolished for 49 off two overs in Wellington, and repaid England’s faith with three wickets of his own. So England live to fight another day but will need to win their three remaining group games, starting with Sri Lanka back in Wellington on Sunday, to ensure their quarter-final place. For now at least they can sleep easily again.

"Sales pitch: Michael McIndoe as a Wolves player in 2007. It is claimed he approached potential investors on behalf of the scheme . Dozens of top Premiership footballers are said to have lost millions of pounds after the collapse of an investment scheme associated with a former star. Millionaire players, including several household names, are said to have handed over cash after being promised a return of 20 per cent a month on their capital. However, the scheme collapsed late last year and the players are now anxiously awaiting news of their money. One international star invested £1million in the scheme, according to  a source. It is claimed that former Wolverhampton Wanderers and Coventry City star Michael McIndoe approached potential investors on behalf of the scheme, but there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on his part. Mr McIndoe previously dated glamour model Helena Fletcher, who appeared as a contestant on BBC gameshow Total Wipeout in 2009. Companies House records show Mr McIndoe, 32, became director of a number of businesses last year, including one business aimed at footballers which promised exclusive access to nightclubs and private jets. A source revealed that Mr McIndoe began approaching stars in the Midlands at the start of last year, claiming it was a ‘guaranteed-return investment scheme’. In April, an invitation-only party was held at a country house hotel in Warwickshire featuring a performance by X Factor winner Alexandra Burke. There is no suggestion she had any involvement in the scheme. As part of the scheme, syndicates were set up in different areas of the country, including the North-West and London. On the first day of each month, one nominated member of each syndicate would travel to a hotel in London’s West End to collect the payouts. But in November the  payments dried up and Mr McIndoe has not been seen since. A source said: ‘The scheme was sold . to people as a guaranteed-return investment scheme. I  personally know . 20 players who have put money in. You got 20 per cent back each month . and could withdraw your  initial investment at any time. 'So if you invested £100,000, you got £20,000 back a month and you could get your £100,000 out. Game on: McIndoe's ex-girlfriend Helena Fletcher appeared as a contestant on Total Wipeout in 2009 . ‘Players did not ask questions as most knew another who had invested and was getting regular returns. ‘The investors received regular monthly payments up until November but since then they have not been paid. Now, players are falling out with each other. They’re  blaming each other for giving them bad advice.’ The source added that Mr McIndoe had recently contacted all of those demanding their money back and promised to repay the cash. There are now fears the investments were made in a Ponzi-style scheme, similar to the one run by US fraudster Bernie Madoff. In a Ponzi scheme, money from new investors is simply redistributed to existing members, rather than being invested to generate returns. That means such schemes eventually collapse. A football agent, who represents a number of Premiership players, said: ‘Some got into the scheme early and did very well and got their money back and the interest. ‘There’s a player with £1 million in that scheme, a player with £500,000, a player with £300,000, and there’s some with £5,000 and £10,000. ‘It’s nothing more than greed. I’ve heard this guy has got to walk around with protection. People have been to Scotland to find his family. ‘The players can’t go to the police. What player is going to stand up in court and say, “Excuse me, Your Honour, I’ve just lost £50,000 of my savings”? ‘They’re going to look like idiots and the club could ask them what they’re doing.’ A financial expert who advises footballers said: ‘We have known about it for a while and have kept our clients well away from it.’ Born in the tough Sighthill district of Edinburgh, Mr McIndoe spoke openly as a young player about his battle to overcome drink and gambling problems. Nevertheless, he went on to enjoy a successful career, scoring 80 league and cup goals for ten clubs. Sources say Mr McIndoe was a charismatic and popular figure among other players. He left Coventry last summer and retired to concentrate on his business career. Fans reported seeing him driving his Bentley around Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, where he and a girlfriend shared an upmarket flat in a large townhouse. However, other residents told The Mail On Sunday Mr McIndoe appeared to have left the property last year in a hurry. Yesterday, Mr McIndoe’s mother and brother declined to comment. Mr McIndoe did not respond to messages left on his mobile.","Former Wolverhampton Wanderers player Michael McIndoe 'approached potential investors on behalf of the scheme'

"That wasn’t in the script: penalties, the Ataturk Stadium and a momentous anniversary looming — surely the only outcome could have been a Liverpool win? Not this time. Here was a European first, Liverpool failing in a shootout, and that it happened at the scene of their greatest triumph thickened the plot. Going out of the Europa League at the hands of Besiktas was not how they aimed to mark 10 years since winning the Champions League. Inevitably, it went to the wire and it took place at the same end at which they outwitted Milan in the 2005 Champions League final. But when Tolgay Arslan thumped home Besiktas’ fifth successful penalty, Dejan Lovren wilted and sent his kick high and wide.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers consoles his players after Lovren was the unlucky man to miss from the penalty spot . ‘Unfortunately, on this occasion, Istanbul is not a happy place,’ conceded a crestfallen Brendan Rodgers. With better finishing, it might have been. Liverpool had opportunities to build on the lead Mario Balotelli had given them at Anfield last week but lacked a killer instinct and it was their misfortune to run into a side, high on energy and fervour, that wanted to create history. It was never going to be a quiet night. With ticket prices reduced to attract a big crowd, the atmosphere had been building all day. Thousands of home fans congregated at the site where their regular stadium is being redeveloped, and come 8pm local time, they were ready to play their part. Yet as loud as the Turks made themselves, Liverpool’s players never flinched. Besiktas had admirable endeavour but no star quality and it became apparent early on that mistakes — or a stroke of genius — would be the visitors’ biggest foe.

Bookings: Balotelli, Can . Manager: Brendan Rodgers 7 . Referee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia) 7 . Attendance: 55,000 . MOTM: Emre Can . Earlier in the season, you would not have put any money on Liverpool holding their nerve but they have turned things around impressively and with the defence working smoothly it became a question of whether they could score to kill the tie. They had enough chances to do so before the break as Balotelli and Daniel Sturridge — a pairing Rodgers had started with only once before — began causing problems for Besiktas with power and running. Balotelli was in the thick of the action straight away, jostling with Necip Uysal and picking up a booking for a lunge at Veli Kavlak, but this wasn’t an erratic display and the deft pass he produced to send Sturridge through should have produced the first goal on 33 minutes. Alberto Moreno and Raheem Sterling had both gone close but neither had the time and space Sturridge was afforded when Balotelli ushered him through. Much to Rodgers’ frustration, however, he wanted to take the shot with his left foot and that allowed Besiktas to scramble the danger away. Sturridge was involved again moments later, this time exchanging passes with Moreno on the edge of the area, but the wing back succeeded only in shooting straight at Cenk Gonen, who comfortably clung on to the drive. Besiktas offered little in response. For all that Slaven Bilic hopped around his technical area, frantically trying to provide some inspiration, the closest they came to finding a breakthrough before half-time was a tame effort from Olcay Sahan that Simon Mignolet easily gathered. Everything, it seemed, was going to plan for Liverpool and the game followed a similar pattern when they emerged after the interval. Though the onus was on Besiktas to be creative and clever, all they offered were speculative attempts from Serdar Kurtulus and Jose Sosa. But there was one key difference. Liverpool’s intensity as an attacking force dwindled and, gradually, they started dropping deeper and deeper. Bilic, who was like a coiled spring, sensed there might be an opening and he made a change, sending on Arslan for the tiring Sosa. How it paid off. Within 12 minutes of his introduction, Arslan dramatically changed the balance of the tie, dispatching a glorious left-foot drive beyond Mignolet after Gokhan Tore and Demba Ba created an opening for him 20 yards out. The stadium erupted as it curled inside the post. There is no question it stunned Liverpool. They looked groggy and were almost knocked out cold in injury time when Ba smashed a shot against the woodwork from eight yards, the chance coming after Arslan slalomed beyond three challenges to win a corner.

Besiktas goalkeeper Cenk Gonen celebrates after his team scored during the Europa League round of 32 second leg  match . Liverpool went 1-0 down against Besiktas in the second leg as the game went to extra time in the Europa League tie . It was only the third penalty shootout defeat in Liverpool’s history — they also lost to Northampton Town in 2010 and Wimbledon in 1993. Extra-time at least enabled Rodgers to work on his squad but that did not halt the shift in momentum. Liverpool looked spent up front and the first 15 minutes became a test of endurance. Mignolet, in particular, excelled, standing firm when Besiktas threatened. A figure of derision not so long ago, he was comfortably Liverpool’s top performer and it became inevitable, as Besiktas started to run out of ideas, that the Belgian would become the main character in the final reckoning. Ultimately, he couldn’t reprise Jerzy Dudek’s role and, for this season, the European adventure has no happy ending. The task now is to make sure they have Europe to look forward to next year. All these years after the Turkish fans welcomed English clubs to hell, and they still put on quite of a show for their visitors. Thousands had massed inside the Ataturk fully two hours before kick-off and a cacophony of boos and whistles greeted the Liverpool players when they emerged in their tracksuits to sample the atmosphere 90 minutes before the start. Liverpool landed back on Merseyside in the early hours of Friday morning confident of escaping any punishment from UEFA over Financial Fair Play regulations. The club have made substantial losses in the last two years, but it is understood that UEFA accept the next financial figures will show a small profit and that Liverpool are on course to make an even bigger one the following year. Besiktas issued an apology to Liverpool fans after some were left stranded in the centre of Istanbul, 90 minutes’ drive from the stadium, when their pre-arranged transport failed to turn up. Liverpool complained to the Turkish club and issued a statement saying: ‘Besiktas have responded by offering a full apology to those supporters affected by the disruption.’ After finishing last week’s first leg at Anfield in controversial circumstances by taking the ball off captain Jordan Henderson to score a penalty, Mario Balotelli was soon at it again on Thursday night. The striker had already had a ticking-off from referee Damir Skomina before he became the first name in the Slovenian official’s book for ploughing into Veli Kavlak.

"Tottenham will stay an extra 24 hours in Italy following tomorrow's Europa League clash against Fiorentina to help prepare for Sunday's Capital One Cup final. Spurs face Fiorentina in Florence on Thursday night, just three days before the Wembley clash against Chelsea. And to ensure the players are fresh going into Sunday's clash, Mauricio Pochettino's side will stay in Florence an extra night, flying back on Friday night. Mauricio Pochettino, instructing Harry Kane, is keeping his players in Italy an extra day to prepare for Sunday . 'This is a very busy period and very difficult for the recovery of the players. For that we decided to stay here after the game in Florence and train here on Friday,' said Pochettino. 'It’s very important to sleep well after the game, to eat well, to recover, because Sunday is another final and we need to provide the players with all the best things to arrive fresh on Sunday. 'I have clear idea for Thursday. Always for us the most important game is Thursday and we need to be focused on the Fiorentina game not on the Capital One Cup.' Tottenham drew the first-leg against Fiorentina 1-1 at White Hart Lane last week and have since drawn 2-2 with West Ham during a packed fixture schedule for Pochettino's side. Roberto Soldado fired in Tottenham's opener in the first-leg against Fiorentina with this volley . Fiorentina, currently fifth in Serie A will provide a stern test for Spurs and Pochettino is well aware of the challenge ahead in Florence: . 'Now the way football is, on TV, it didn’t surprise me the way they played. We watched a lot of their games and it didn’t surprise me. We know they have very good players and play in a very attractive way. Nothing special,' said the Spurs boss. 'I told you before the first game in London about Montella, is a coach who seems a little bit Spanish. Playing with a lot of Spanish players and the way they play is very similar to us because always try to play on the grass and always thinking on the opponent goal. We have a similar style, similar philosophy.' Soldado wheels away in celebration having fired Spurs into an early lead at White Hart lane last week . Kane, scoring in Tottenham's 5-3 win over Chelsea on January 1, will hope to defeat the Blues on Sunday . It’s been a damaging fortnight for football with several race and violence related incidents hitting the headlines but the Spurs manager is adamant the Tottenham fans will conduct themselves in the appropriate manner in Italy: . ‘Our fans are very respectful. In the few games we’ve played before in the Europa League in Greece, Turkey, Serbia, the behaviour of our fans was great fantastic no problem,’ added the Argentinian. ‘Maybe because I think it’s better to be careful but our supporters always in the past in the last three games behaviour was fantastic. We need to be respectful and have the same behaviour.’","Mauricio Pochettino's side face Fiorentina in the Europa League last 32 .

"As excitement builds around Sunday's final between Chelsea and Tottenham, Sportsmail asked two fans to take part in a Capital One Cup final Q&A.

Click here to follow TTW on Twitter . Feeling confident? RJ: Extremely. After the catastrophe that was New Year’s Day we owe Tottenham massively. Combine that with the fact that they  played in Italy on Thursday night in a huge match while we have had over a week off, and Matic’s ban aside, we couldn’t really ask for much more going into the game. DK: Yeah, weirdly I'm very confident, perhaps because I can't bring myself to contemplate defeat. Eden Hazard (left) of Chelsea and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen (right) will hope to inspire their team to a win . There’s plenty of history between the two teams – what is it that make this rivalry intense? RJ: Its very tricky to put a finger on exactly why the rivalry is so venomous. From their perspective I assume it’s the fact that they couldn’t beat us for years even when they had a superior team. Or the fact that they haven’t won a league match at Stamford Bridge for 25 years. Or the fact that we knocked them out of the Champions League by becoming the first London club to win it. For us I think its more to do with the hatred we receive from them. It's responsive. DK: I hate Arsenal for who they are but I hate Chelsea for what they are – a morally bankrupt, jammy, despicable club, with some of the most dislikable personnel in the game. The majority of their fans are in the same vein. Our terrible record against them, plus the Champions League fiasco, also contributes to the recent bad feeling but the rivalry dates back decades. Tottenham fans generally don't have fun at Stamford Bridge, and that may be a reason for the rivalry . Stewards  remove a fan from the pitch during an FA Cup quarter-final replay at White Hart Lane . Spurs were underdogs in the 2008 final but beat Chelsea 2-1, will lightning strike twice? RJ: The Chelsea team of 2008 were not a team of winners. It had all the hallmarks of an Avram Grant team, who I believe has just taken his side to second in the Africa Cup of Nations. Under Grant we came out second best in the Carling Cup, second in the Premier League and second in the Champions League. And we were knocked out of the FA Cup by Barnsley. You say they were underdogs but I don’t think too many Chelsea fans were surprised that Grant managed to steer us to defeat that day. DK: Yeah, we'd love a 2-1 this season, and I think we're more closely matched now than then. Jubilant Tottenham player after beating Chelsea to lift the Carling Cup in 2008 . What are your memories of that day? RJ: The overriding memory of the day is the pain and torture as Woodgate got to the ball ahead of Cech right in front of us. And then being soaking wet at Wembley listening to endless renditions of 'Oh When The Spurs'... it was agony but it Tottenham deserved it. They were excellent. It takes huge character to come back from a goal down in a cup final. DK: I had a ticket but in the corporate seats at Wembley. There were more Chelsea fans and neutrals around me than Spurs fans but it was stunning looking across at the Spurs end and the noise was incredible. I can't remember much of the game but Berbatov's cool penalty obviously stands out and I went crazy when Woodgate scored. A couple of the Chelsea fans shook my hand at the final whistle, which was a touch.· . Jonathan Woodgate nods home the winner - getting to the ball before goalkeeper Petr Cech . Dimitar Berbatov netted a cool penalty during the 2-1 victory at Wembley Stadium . Which of your players will make the difference this time around? RJ: I think the only bright spot when Tottenham destroyed us on New Years Day was the performance of Eden Hazard. He seemed to really understand the rivalry and how desperate Chelsea fans were to get something from the game. If he plays to a similar level and those around him raise their game, I think that he could be too much for Spurs to deal with. DK: Kane and Eriksen are the obvious ones but I've got a good feeling about Lamela too. Harry Kane will be looking to make the difference against Chelsea at Wembley this weekend . That 5-3 game is still fresh in the memory – how will that affect this game? RJ: I think it will affect the game positively for everybody. It will definitely inspire Tottenham, they scored five goals against us. However, I also think it will inspire Chelsea. There isn’t a better way to get back at a team to whom you feel you owe one, by beating them at a final at Wembley. DK: On the one hand, it will give Spurs belief they can outplay and beat Chelsea, which is crucial. On the other, it will make the Chelsea players (who must be prioritising the Premier League and Champions League) extra motivated to exact revenge. So, it could be beneficial for both teams. Chelsea players look dejected after losing 5-3 to Tottenham at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day . And what of Nemanja Matic's ban? RJ: Huge. Disastrous. Close to being irreplaceable. But I think that Mourinho will opt for Ramires. Now I concede that Ramires doesn’t have the presence of Matic but he is a wonderful player, capable of chipping Valdes in the Nou Camp or scoring in the FA Cup final against Liverpool. I have full faith in him. DK: He's a good player and hopefully Eriksen can exploit the space created by his absence. But it shouldn't make too much difference. If Chelsea – one of the richest clubs in the world, who routinely buy players to stop them joining rivals – can't cope without one midfielder, then their squad isn't nearly as strong as everyone thinks. Nemanja Matic was sent off against Burnley and will miss the final - his absence is a huge loss for Chelsea . Generally, Spurs don't beat Chelsea that often, do they? RJ: Well over the course of my lifetime generally not. However, we have never beaten them in a cup final which is slightly worrying. Third time lucky I hope. DK: No but I'm happy with Spurs' record against Chelsea in cup finals. Tottenham players celebrate with the FA Cup after beating Chelsea 2-1 in 1967 . What are your plans on the day of the game? RJ: A pint of Guinness around Great Portland Street to ease the nerves before Met-lining it into Wembley. There isn’t a better feeling in football. DK: I haven't got a ticket (yet) so I'm going to watch at home with some mates and try to write a few articles, then go out to celebrate our victory afterwards. There's no better feeling in football than making your way to Wembley on cup final day . Finally, your predictions, please. RJ: 3-1 Chelsea. DK: There's been lots of goals when we've played Chelsea this season, so I'll go 3-2 Spurs after extra time.","Chelsea take on Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday .

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic wanted to join Real Madrid after leaving Barcelona because it would have been the 'perfect revenge' on Pep Guardiola, his agent has revealed. The Swedish striker, now plying his trade for Paris Saint-Germain in France, left Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan for Barcelona in 2009, but lasted just one season  after falling out with Guardiola. Now, Ibrahimovic's agent Mino Raiola has spoken openly about the Swede's difficult relationship with his former manager - a man he has openly called a 'coward' in the past. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in action for Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday, left Barcelona after just one season . Ibrahimovic (third left) celebrates after scoring a goal for Barcelona in the Champions League in 2010 . 'Zlatan wanted to play for Real [Madrid] when he left Barcelona,' Raiola told Spanish newspaper Marca. 'It would have been the ideal move; the perfect revenge against Guardiola. 'As a person, Guardiola's behaviour was terrible, shocking. He's a great coach. [He called Zlatan] about 10 times [in the year he was at Barcelona]. He told him whatever he needed or wanted, he would be helped with. Then all of a sudden, he stopped talking to him.' Ibrahimovic - who is the most expensive footballer of all time in combined transfer fees - has previously alleged that Lionel Messi, his former team-mate at Barcelona, had been unhappy with the impact Ibrahimovic made at the Nou Camp. Ibrahimovic scored six goals in 12 starts for Barcelona, but did not get on with manager Pep Guardiola . The Swedish striker's agent Mino Raiola does not believe that he will finish his career at Paris Saint-Germain . In fact, according to the Swede, Messi complained to Barcelona because, 'I scored more goals than him.' Raiola admits that he doesn't know if Ibrahimovic's problems were solely down to Messi's status at the club, but told a story involving then Barcelona director of football Txiki Begiristain. 'I remember Txiki Begiristain called me in November and told me he wanted to talk with me: ""Look, Messi is upset, he's not happy. He's not scoring many goals and Zlatan has to help him."" 'Ibra said it was fine and agreed. One month later Txiki told me Guardiola was going to change the system in spite of him not agreeing. ""No problem,"" I told him. Txiki then tells me there's a problem: ""Messi was upset and went crying to Guardiola and he's going to play through the middle and Guardiola's not going to play two strikers."" Ibrahimovic left Barcelona after a season because he did not get on with manager Pep Guardiola (centre) Raiola (right) has lifted the lid on Ibrahimovic's exit from Barcelona after just one season at the Nou Camp . 'Pep didn't speak to Zlatan again, not even when he was injured.' Despite eventually joining AC Milan on loan, before moving on a permanent deal, Ibrahimovic's desire when leaving Barcelona was to join their rivals Real Madrid, where he could then exact revenge on Guardiola. '[Ibrahimovic] was more professional than ever and wanted to sign for Real Madrid,' Raiola added, 'but they didn't have the balls at the Bernabeu and no clear plan.' Instead, he went to AC Milan, before joining Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2012. He has impressed in the French capital, but his agent has a clear message when it comes to his future. The Parc des Princes may not be his home when he hangs up his boots. 'I don't think Ibra will finish his career at PSG.'","Zlatan Ibrahimovic joined Barcelona in 2009, but only lasted one season .

"Number 40, Southwark Street, in south-east London is not your average Georgian house.

Alex Chinneck stands in front of his masterpiece a few weeks ago, before it started melting .

He built it in homage to a candle-making factory that stood in the area more than 100 years ago. Over the last 12 months, Mr Chinneck has liaised with engineers and wax specialists to make the brickwork look as convincing as possible. The installation was commissioned  as part of the Bankside Transformed - Merge Festival. The floating market of Covent Garden . Earlier this month, Alex Chinneck created a stunning optical illusion that appeared to make a building at one of London’s busiest tourist districts hover in mid-air. To passers-by, it looked as though a section of the historic market building in Covent Garden had broken free from its foundations and was floating unaided, high above them. But in reality, the display, which imitated the architecture in the area, was a complicated piece of technical wizardry which took months to create. This installation, named Take My Lightning But Don't Steal My Thunder, was created by the Alex Chinneck (pictured) A passing couple peer inside the building which appears to be torn apart with one half suspended in mid-air with no support . Named Take My Lightning But Don’t Steal My Thunder, it seemed as though the 184-year-old market building was torn off and levitating with a large gap between the broken ‘stone’ walls, pillars and doors. The 12-metre-long sculpture was made from a steel frame and a type of expanded polystyrene called filcor. It is understood to have taken 500 hours to paint using special digital techniques and was designed to resemble the existing architecture in the area. The illusion of it floating was created by using a heavy counterweight strong enough to support the top half of the structure as it hung over the bottom half. A steel beam was hidden inside the green market stall to the side of the building and this was attached to a steel platform and a 12-metre cantilever. In the past, using similar techniques, Mr Chinneck appeared to have turned a house upside down - also in Southwark. Construction workers in harnesses can be seen balancing precariously inside the perfect replica of Covent Garden's Market Building as it is lowered by cranes .","Installation is brainchild of British artist Alex Chinneck, known for his optical illusions .

"It's thought that until 1970, the mysterious Korowai tribe of south eastern Papua, Indonesian New Guinea, were unaware of the existence of any other people on earth. Living as remotely as they do - perched 140 feet up into the canopy of the least explored jungles in the world - it's quite plausible. The tribe are known for their distinctive  treehouses that tower over the jungle on spindly stilts, originally designed to avoid attacks from rival clans intent on capturing people for slavery or even cannibalism. Scroll down for video . The majority of the tribe still live in 140-foot high tree dwellings, deep within the jungle on the  isolated Indonesian island of New Guinea . The Korowai adhere to age old tradition, sharing myths, folktales, sayings and charms to this day, and believe that their dead ancestors can return to land of the living at any time. Some clans are said to fear Westerners, having never seen them, and outsiders are called ' ghost demons'. The first documented contact with the Western world was when a group of scientists met with members of one clan in March, 1974. In May 2006, tour-guide and reporter Paul Raffaele led an Australian TV crew to meet the tribe. It's thought that until 1970, the Korowai tribe  were unaware of the existence of other any other people on earth . The crew claimed that they were approached by a man who told them his six-year old nephew had been accused of being a witch doctor and was in danger of being cannibalised. In an article for Smithsonian, Raffaele said: 'Korowai are among the very few tribes believed to eat human flesh. 'Most Korowai still live with little knowledge of the world beyond their homelands and frequently feud with one another. Some are said to kill and eat male witches they call ""khakhua"".' Anthropologists suspect that cannibalism is no longer practised by the Korowai clans.

"Manchester United’s new kit contract has led to serious repercussions for Andy Murray, the England cricket team and rugby’s British and Irish Lions. All three have lost backing from adidas because of their £750million investment in supplying United shirts from next season. Adidas were not prepared to renew their shirt agreement with Murray because of the increased cost, while the England cricket partnership has been greatly downgraded and might end early. And the German company have announced they will be ending their 18-year association with the Lions — despite replica shirts selling so well. Manchester United's adidas deal will begin next season, ending their association with Nike . Andy Murray has already had his ties to adidas cut - the Scot is now with American firm Under Armour . The massive price of winning the United deal from arch-rivals Nike has meant adidas have had to re-evaluate the importance of other properties, with their funding focused on the core activities of football, fitness and running. American firm Under Armour, with whom Murray signed when adidas did not meet his numbers, are also favourites to take over the Lions contract for the next tour to New Zealand in 2017. The Millennium Stadium has always put on the best pre-match show in the Six Nations. But their impressive laser display last Friday night cannot be emulated by England Rugby 2015 as it will be only dusk when the World Cup opening ceremony finishes at Twickenham around 7.30pm on September 18. Instead they will utilise the pitch itself in way that doesn’t jeopardize the playing surface when England take on Fiji half-an-hour later. The atmosphere at the Millennium Stadium was crackling with the pre-match pyrotechnics before the match . You can’t get away with anything on social media, even if a tweet is more than two years old. A screen grab of foul-mouthed BBC rugby co-commentator Brain Moore’s response from January 2013 — after being told by an astute armchair rugby viewer that he turns the sound off because of Moore — was retweeted hundreds of times during England’s win in Cardiff on Friday. The loveable Moore (above) wrote: ‘Use the red button for the alternative commentary, you thick t***.’ BBC wouldn’t comment. Brian Moore - former England international - was caught out as Twitter users retweeted an old comment . The signs are pointing to the Premier League getting £4billion from their seven TV packages, which are all expected to go to a second round of bidding today. Sky, BT and the Discovery Channel are thought to be competing, with beIN Sport a possible contender as well. But the way first picks for games involving the top clubs have been contained within the four packages that Sky are hell-bent on retaining might be the subject of contention. However, the Premier League say they have spread the picks more equitably in the latest tender. BLATTER'S AFRICA GROVEL . There was a clear subtext to Sepp Blatter accusing Western media of dramatising the serious crowd violence that interrupted the Africa Cup of Nations semi-final between Ghana and Equatorial Guinea. Blatter said: ‘When something bad happens in Europe, they say it’s an error. When something happens in Africa, they begin talking about corruption.’ It’s safe to infer that Blatter knows he will not get the UEFA vote in May’s presidential election and instead wants to shore up support from Africa by currying favour at every opportunity. Sepp Blatter (right), pictured presenting the AFCON 2015 trophy to Ivory Coast's Yaya Toure on Sunday . Meanwhile, German newspaper Der Spiegel has alleged that lawyers acting for Blatter removed some critical passages from governance committee chairman Mark Pieth’s report into FIFA structures. Before Pieth’s findings were made public last year they were sent to Marco Villiger, FIFA’s director of legal affairs, to ‘check the facts’. But Villager’s 37 comments also asked for word changes and deletions regarding Blatter’s conduct that were agreed by Pieth, whose report shows the president in a remarkably good light. FIFA say it is normal procedure. Even when Jose Mourinho is back fulfilling his media obligations he likes to stir the mix. So he told BBC Sport after Chelsea’s win at Aston Villa that he likes them because they ‘do not ask for players to be banned’ — a clear reference to Sky after the Diego Costa stamping incidents. Mourinho was a Sky ambassador when he called their coverage ‘special’. Now he’s a well-remunerated BT representative.","Adidas have not renewed their shirt agreement with Andy Murray .

Spurs lost 2-0 to Fiorentina as the Serie A side progressed to the last 16 of the Europa League but Mourinho does not believe that will affect the outcome at Wembley.

'They can change all those players so I don't think the physical side is a point. 'To play yesterday (Thursday) was good for them because they play with players who aren't playing in the final.' Nemanja Matic will miss Sunday's game because of suspension after being given a two-game ban for the red card he picked up for pushing Burnley's Ashley Barnes to the ground last weekend. The midfielder's ban was reduced by one match by the FA but Mourinho and Chelsea had hoped it would be completely overturned after Matic reacted to poor challenge from the former Brighton man. Asked about the situation, Mourinho said: 'If I give you my views, it's bad for me. I can't give you my views because it's bad for me. 'If I speak again about the Matic situation, I promise I will be in big trouble. I can't talk (about Ashley Barnes).'

Matic (second from right) is suspended for Sunday's final after being sent off against Burnley . Diego Costa has also come under the spotlight for his physical style this season and was banned for three games after stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can in the semi-final second leg. Mourinho admits that his star striker needs to be wary on Sunday and in each game he plays from now on. 'He has to be careful, but not with his behaviour,' said Mourinho. 'He has to be careful because of other players and, as a consequence, the way referees look at him. Not because of how he has played since arriving in England. He has done very well.' Chelsea won the League Cup 10 years ago in Mourinho's first season in charge, a victory which began a spell of success for the west London club. This time the Portuguese insists he is simply focused on winning his first trophy since returning to Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2013. Diego Costa must be careful because of the way referees view him, according to his manager Mourinho . Star strikers Costa and Harry Kane will come up against each other in Sunday's showpiece final .

I don't think about the consequences. I just think about this game. We have a final to win on Sunday and nothing else matters. 'I have affinities with every competition. I respect every competition. It would be easy now because we lost against Bradford to say we didn't take the FA Cup seriously, but we did. 'Probably lots of teams follow us since 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 when we took the League Cup as a real competition, a real challenge, and we were trying to reach finals and to win.

Many times they were at Wembley, winning FA Cups, and won Premier League and European competitions. Chelsea have done very well. 'Now, with a new team and people who were not with dozens of finals at Wembley, will try and bring this new generation of players and this new team to make Wembley something normal for us, normal in the sense that we will try and get there year after year. 'I don't think about consequences. I don't think that, if you win the Cup final, you win the league or vice versa. I don't feel connections. 'I feel this is the way I want to do it, and the players the same, it's a game we have to play, a final. After that, the Capital One Cup is over. 'If you go home with the cup and a medal, perfect. Monday is another day. Tuesday we have to train. Wednesday we have to play. No time to think about consequences. 'It's a final we have to play and a final we have to win.

"It could mean the end of panicking when you've forgotten your keys. A US firm has launched a 'smart lock' that can let you into your home using a mobile phone - and you don't even need to take the phone out of your pocket to open the door. The August lock costs £130 ($199) and can even be set to automatically let in friends or workmen. Scroll down for video . The August lock is a keyless entry system that works using Bluetooth. When a registered device gets near to the lock the homeowner or visitor can open the door by pressing the relevant address entry on the August app. The lock takes a few seconds to confirm the visitor's identity and, once confirmed, the red LED lights turn green and the lick twists to open the door . The August lock runs on AA batteries and can be fitted to existing door locks in 10 minutes. The lock sits on the inside of the door, which means homeowners can still use regular keys if they forget their phone, for example. When the batteries get low an email is automatically sent to the homeowner to replace them .

Behar told TechCrunch: 'There are emotional barriers [with the door lock]. 'People don’t want their homes to be susceptible to burglary or unwanted guests, but at the same time, do often want to welcome people into their houses for various occasions. When a visitor enters or leaves the house using the August lock, a message is sent to the homeowner detailing who had entered the house. The details are also added to a log. A Guestbook function lets guests or the host leave notes, instructions and photos via the app too . 'There’s a balance between these two feelings, and it hasn’t been met by the centuries-old key lock system, or by other recent locking mechanisms. 'Until recent technologies came into the mainstream, such as Bluetooth-LE, it was a lot harder to do . 'There are biometric systems for door entry on the market now, such as iris scanners and thumbprint readers, but they are very expensive and very complex. They are really systems for rich people' 'We’re giving people an easy way to transition to this 21st century way to enter, to have access and to give access.' Research carried out by the company found that 40 per cent of people carry five or more keys with them and 20 per cent carry a key they no longer use. This technology is not the first of its kind. Onefinestay, a site which lets homeowners rent out their properties to tourists, introduced it keyless entry technology called Sherlock in February. Sherlock uses a physical device and a smartphone app to let people into all types of homes, including apartments by using a mobile phone. VIDEO: Goodbye keyring!

"CLICK HERE to read Sam Peters' full match report from Twickenham . That was a very impressive performance from George Ford at fly-half in his first England start and he has to ‘go again’ against Australia next week, a game England must win. And he must play again with Owen Farrell who wasn’t quite so impressive individually but this combination must be given time to grow. My only big regret from Saturday is that England took Farrell off midway through the second half. That didn’t make a lot of sense, they need as much game time together as possible. George Ford (centre) impressed on his full international debut in England's 28-9 defeat of Samoa . Ford played at fly-half - moving his childhood friend Owen Farrell (right) in to the centre . Ford impressed me in many ways. Physically he immediately proved he was up to it by taking two or three big hits from the Samoans, who will undoubtedly have targeted him and would look to have tested him out physically as soon as possible. There were a couple of nice touch finders and he did very well indeed for England’s first try running a wrap around with Farrell and then finding Mike Brown with a good pass to create the opportunity for Jonny May to show his pace and score by the posts. Again there was an electric break on the half hour which probably should have resulted in a second England try but he possibly overcooked the pass a little and Mike Brown couldn’t cling on. Then in the second half he produced a moment of sumptuous class with his cross-field kick to Anthony Watson to create Mike Brown’s try. England's only error of judgement was to remove Farrell midway through the second half . Ford combined well with Farrell by running a wrap around that led to England's first try . Jonny May dives over the line to score his second try and end England's losing run . His goal kicking was very steady, my one constructive criticism is that given the conditions and his excellent kicking game — and indeed that of Farrell — England tried to play too much rugby too early in the first half . England should have been ‘playing’ 20-30 yards further down the pitch. Make that kicking expertise count territorially before you start ‘playing’. He was honest enough to admit his fault afterwards, now he must show the confidence to change on the hoof in the heat of battle. With Farrell, my only real concern is that given his physicality — he loves to get involved — he is probably joining too many mauls and rucks. The big advantage of playing two footballers and playmakers in the side is that you always have the two options available. Anthony Watson (centre) breaks through ahead of passing to Mike Brown for England's second try . England coach Stuart Lancaster has several selection decisions to make ahead of the South Africa clash . You don’t want one of the players tied up needlessly in the heavy forward exchanges no matter how physically able he might be. For Australia, I would bring Dylan Hartley back at hooker and, although it’s a bit unfair on Brad Barritt, I would go with Luther Burrell at outside centre. You need that extra pace outside Farrell. I also enjoyed a lot of what Anthony Watson did, he must go again and get more game time in huge matches. I would also bring Danny Cipriani on to the bench. If the big decision had been made to go with Ford/Farrell England need a like for like replacement at 10 if Ford gets injured. Mike Brown’s second-half try. George Ford’s cross-field kick was a beauty, drilled hard and low to keep the hang time to a minimum so that defenders didn’t have a chance to organise themselves. Anthony Watson did very well to latch on to the ball and even better to resist the temptation to go for glory in just his second start for England and score a try in front of 82,000 fans at Twickenham. Watson scoring was 50-50 at best but he capped an impressive performance by showing the maturity to pass to Mike Brown, who was in a better position to make scoring a certainty. It was very classy and professional. It was also an important moment for Brown, who will have enjoyed getting back on the scoreboard.","England defeated Samoa 28-9 in their QBE Autumn International .

"It was supposed to make NSW Premier Mike Baird appear more hip and appealing to a younger generation in the lead up to state elections next month. But the Liberal leader earned an Internet fail on Friday when the video posted online of him reading out nasty tweets about himself - imitating US comedian Jimmy Kimmel's popular TV spot 'Mean Tweets' - was pulled for trampling copyright restrictions. Mr Baird's use of  music by Taylor Swift and R.E.M without permission are believed to be behind the video take-down. Scroll down for video .

Your charming smile hides your black Liberal heart.' Mr Baird had ended his video with a reference to singers Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. Responding to a Tweet he received that read: 'Mike Baird just announced he hates Justin Bieber', Mr Baird said: 'Yes, of course I hate Justin Bieber, who doesn't hate Justin Bieber, what's wrong with that?' He then added: 'But my daughters are Taylor Swift fans and they tell me, when you get this sort of stuff, shake it off!' R.E.M's 'Everybody Hurts', which had been used as background music during the video, was then abruptly replaced by Swift's Shake It Off while the Premier was filmed laughing. But less than 24 hours after the video was uploaded on Thursday, the premier's shot at viral fame backfired when YouTube administrators removed it for infringing copyright. Upon removing the video, YouTube explained that it would no longer be available due to a copyright claim by Warner Chappell, who owns the rights to both songs, Junkee reports.

"It was after Jos Buttler’s incendiary 121 off 74 balls in the Lord’s one-day international against Sri Lanka in May that Alastair Cook announced his limited-overs wicketkeeper was ‘not ready’ for Test cricket. Self-effacingly, Buttler agreed. But after more mishaps with the gloves yesterday from Matt Prior, attitudes might have changed. The 32-year-old Prior is a warhorse of 78 Tests, well-liked by colleagues and with a proud record as a counter-attacking No 7. Under pressure: Doubts have been cast on Matt Prior's position as England's No 1 wicketkeeper after a number of missed catches in the first Test with India at Trent Bridge . Beaten: A shot from India's Cheteshwar Pujara finds its way past the dive of Prior on day four of the first Test at Trent Bridge . The competition: There have been calls for Jos Buttler (left), England's short form wicketkeeper, to replace Prior in the team . After being dropped for the last two Tests of the Australian debacle, he was recalled against Sri Lanka at Lord’s and responded with a punchy 86. Named England’s Cricketer of the Year in May 2013, Prior had apparently refound his zest. Since then, though, things have threatened to unravel. It’s hard to be over-critical of his batting: he alone held on during England’s first-innings collapse against Sri Lanka at Headingley, and on Friday here in Nottingham he fell victim to a dismal piece of umpiring from Kumar Dharmasena. But his glovework is another matter. The alarm bells began to ring at Headingley, where Prior dropped Kumar Sangakkara on 27 shortly after lunch on a chaotic first day. The catch was so straightforward that Liam Plunkett was halfway through a celebratory leap when Prior allowed the ball, which he didn’t realise had been pinned to his chest by his gloves, to plop to earth. Disappointed: Prior could only make five runs in England's innings, which was rescued by an unlikely last wicket stand between Joe Root and James Anderson . Appealed: India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni successfully pleads the wicket of Prior off the bowling of Bhuvneshwar Kumar . Heroic: James Anderson set a world record on Saturday as he and Joe Root formed a final wicket partnership of 198 to rescue England on the fourth day of the first Test with India at Trent Bridge in Nottingham . If there was a touch of misfortune about that, then his wicketkeeping in this Test has done little to quell fears the Achilles trouble which limited him to one early-season Championship match for Sussex is not evidence of irreversible wear and tear. Even ahead of this game, Buttler was called up as cover because Prior was experiencing tightness in his right thigh. Prior allayed fears with a smart catch to his left to see off India opener Shikhar Dhawan on Wednesday morning, but has since missed three chances low to his right: MS Dhoni was dropped on 50 on the second morning, and on Saturday afternoon he twice failed to lay a glove on chances offered by Murali Vijay. Whether Buttler would have snaffled them may no longer be the point. He is 23, full of drive and invention, and is averaging 40 for struggling Lancashire. He is just the sort of cricketer, in other words, who might fit neatly into the template of a brave new era.","Prior's glovework is becoming a cause for concern, with several missed chances against India .
His batting remains beyond reproach, though he only made five in England's innings at Trent Bridge .
Jos Buttler, England one-day wicketkeeper, is waiting for his Test chance ."
"At Selhurst Park last Saturday, when Chelsea were playing Crystal Palace, an act of supreme sportsmanship passed almost unnoticed. Not quite in the same league as Paolo Di Canio when he caught the ball inside the Everton penalty area at Goodison Park after Paul Gerrard dislocated his knee in December 2000. Or UEFA giving Robbie Fowler a fair play award after he pleaded with referee Gerald Ashby not to award a penalty to Liverpool when he went down under a challenge from Arsenal keeper David Seaman in 1997. Jose Mourinho (right) shaking hands with Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock on Saturday . Mourinho celebrates Chelsea's victory after a match during which he showed his more generous side . A smiling Mourinho speaks during the pre-match press conference before Chelsea faced Maribor . Still, Jose Mourinho’s generosity should be highlighted, particularly after a weekend of football that finished with Swansea manager Garry Monk accusing Stoke winger Victor Moses of cheating. Mourinho’s rampant Chelsea team were 2-0 up passing the ball for fun as Palace willed it to go out of play for them to make a substitution. At the time, with Chelsea in complete control after goals from Oscar and Cesc Fabregas, it felt like Palace manager Neil Warnock would be made to wait for ever. Both teams were already down to 10. Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta was sent off for a studs-up challenge on Mile Jedinak and Palace defender Damien Delaney was sent off for a second booking before half-time. With 21 minutes left, Warnock’s team were temporarily reduced to nine when James McArthur was forced off the field with an ankle injury. It was then that Mourinho approached Warnock in the technical area. Mourinho passed a message to Fabregas, the closest Chelsea player to the technical area and his team suddenly eased off. Palace were finally able to get the ball out of play. Warnock made the substitution, bringing on Adlene Guedioura to replace McArthur to even the teams up, numerically at least. To Mourinho’s credit he then instructed Oscar, who received the ball from Chelsea’s throw-in, to kick the ball back to Palace keeper Julian Speroni. The Brazilian obliged. It was a magnificent sporting gesture. There are times when it is easy to bury Mourinho for his touchline posturing, but he has been on his best behaviour of late. Against Arsenal on October 5, he had very little involvement in the incident which led to Arsene Wenger shoving him in the chest during their 2-0 defeat. There was the usual mischief in the air last Friday when he reacted to news that Wenger had got off scott-free after the incident at Stamford Bridge. ‘Me? Me? Me?’ he joked. ‘Stadium ban’. He has taken to answering tricky situations by lacing them with sarcasm to avoid appearances on the back pages for all the wrong reasons. Mourinho is usually far more gracious when his team are winning and he is has certainly been in a better mood of late. Arsene Wenger and Mourinho during their infamous touchline spat in Chelsea's win over Arsenal . Ahead of the game at Palace, which they eventually won 2-1, Chelsea’s manager claimed he is ‘a humble guy who tries to learn every day’. He was referring to Roy Keane’s criticism of Mourinho after he attempted to shake hands with Paul Lambert when his team were beating Aston Villa 3-0 on September 27. He is no angel on the touchline, we know that. Last season he provoked Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini when he jumped into the stands to celebrate with his son Jose Jnr after Fernando Torres’ last-minute winner. He has since apologised for jabbing former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova, sadly no longer with us, in the eye during a highly-charged Super Cup tie with Real Madrid in 2011. He has cleaned up his act on the touchline, something he has spoken about since his return to English football with Chelsea. Paolo Di Canio holds the ball after catching it so Paul Gerrard (centre, on floor) can receive treatment in 2000 . Robbie Fowler (right) and David Seaman look perplexed after the award of a penalty in 1997 . Last March he said: ‘In this country, it’s easier to behave because almost everybody behaves and the fourth officials are there to help, not create more problems. ‘Normally they’re there to speak and have a dialogue, telling you to calm down, that you don’t need to do that, mustn’t make it difficult for the referee. I know I have that responsibility to show maturity. ‘I know I have normally a better emotional control than one year ago, two years ago, five years ago. I know experience helps.’ He was on the edge of the technical area for all the right reasons on Saturday when he he spoke with Warnock about making the change to make it ten versus ten again. Would he have made the same gesture if Chelsea weren’t in complete control, ‘from minute one to minute 94’, as Mourinho remarked after the game? Actually, let’s not go there.","Jose Mourinho made Chelsea put ball out when Crystal Palace were a man down at Selhurst Park on Saturday .

"Tara Moss has described for the first time how she was raped by the 'cool guy' in her acting class more than 20 years ago. The 41-year-old, who is an author and former model, was living in Vancouver when she was assaulted by the man after he offered her a lift home. 'The one time I was raped was as typical as every stat you hear: someone you know and trust,' Moss told Good Weekend magazine. Tara Moss has opened up for the first time about how she was raped by a man she knew 20 years ago in Vancouver . Moss, who was just 21 at the time of the attack, said he drove her to his house and invited her in for a cup of tea. He then threw himself on her and would not take no for an answer. The Canadian-born model described mentally floating out of her body as she was pinned against a wall for hours while he was sleeping, before finally escaping when he went to the bathroom. 'Everything that you are gets removed. You're not there anymore and everything you thought you were and thought the world was gets vacuumed out; you lose your footing,' she said. The 41-year-old acclaimed writer is mum to three-year-old daughter Sapphira . Moss, who lives in the Blue Mountains with her Australian poet husband Berndt Sellheim and three-year-old daughter Sapphira, reported the attack to police and the man was eventually charged with about a dozen other sexual assaults. He was jailed for two years for one rape after his friends testified against him. The mother of one has broken her 20-year silence in her first non-fiction book, The Fictional Woman, which will be published next week. Moss also details a number of other sexual assaults and near misses she endured in her early years, including being followed, groped and physically and verbally abused. The mother of one has broken her 20-year silence in her first non-fiction book, The Fictional Woman, which will be published next week . She described how she was once walking home in Milan when four Americans pulled up next to her in a car – one man held the door open and another chased her until she reached her apartment. The Fictional Woman weaves her own experiences into a broader look at everyday sexism and issues surrounding women . 'That was the closest I've come to being dumped by the side of the road, and maybe not alive,' she said. Moss started writing crime fiction two years after the attack. She spent 15 years on a six-book series about a former model studying for a PhD who is attacked by a rapist and murderer. The series was published in 18 countries and was shortlisted for various literary awards. Her most recent book weaves her own experiences into a broader look at everyday sexism and issues surrounding women, motherhood and portrayal of women in politics and the media. By sharing her own trauma in the book, Moss said she wanted to show that she was a survivor and not a victim. As a women's right advocate and UNICEF ambassador, Moss said she wants to fight the misconception that people often bring problems up themselves saying that view is problematic when it comes to sexual violence. Moss credits her mother  as the person who has given her the strength to be who she is today - she died from cancer of the bone marrow when Moss was a teenager. Harrowing experience: The former model was just 21-years-old when she was attacked by the man who offered her a lift home . The Fictional Woman is due for release on May 22.","Tara Moss was raped when she was 21 by a man in her acting class .

"'Bullfighting is not a sport. It was never supposed to be. It is a tragedy ... The tragedy is the death of the bull.' So wrote Ernest Hemingway after he witnessed his first bullfight as a reporter in Spain. But three bulls yesterday turned the tables on their killers. They challenged their own ritual slaughter - and won. Olé! David Mora is floored by an El Ventorrillo fighting bull during a bullfight at Las Ventas bullring in Madrid . Beast versus man: The matador is tossed backwards by the huge bull, which is primed for the kill . Floored: Mora was downed by his first bull, before he was even able to plant any banderillos into its body . Head over heels: Mora is flicked around the bullring like a ragdoll by the enraged bull he intended to kill . Gored: Mora was pierced through his femoral artery by the bull, and needed immediate emergency surgery . The goring is seen here from another angle. Mora was still in intensive care today but was said to be recovering . Disaster: Mora's fellow matadors run to his aide, capes flapping, as he is repeatedly gored by the raging bull . Occupational hazard: Assistants help a grimacing Mora from the bullring after he was badly wounded in the fight yesterday . A right bulls up: The injured matador is carried away as his blood drips down the elaborate outfit of one of his assistants . Bulls 3 - Matadors 0. If bullfights had a score line that would have been the one at the Las Ventas ring in Madrid, Spain, on Tuesday evening. All three matadors were gored, one of them severely, and the rest of the bloody spectacle was cancelled because there was nobody left standing to fight. It happened at the 12th corrida in the Spanish capital, less than half-way through the Fiesta of San Isidro, the biggest single event in the official season. Described by Hemingway as the 'World Series of bullfighting', it lasts for nearly a month with a fight every day. Antonio Nazare is gored in his leg by a Los Chospes ranch fighting bull after killing the one that took out Mora . Nazare falls to the ground bleeding after his clash with the bull. Fighting bulls usually weigh about half a ton . Tragedy: Nazare's cape drops to reveal the bull's bloodied back, as it makes sure he is unable to get back up . Death in the afternoon: The bull which beat Nazare spews blood after it is killed by Jimenez Fortes, top second left, in the traditional manner - but without the flair and flamboyance which bullfight audiences come for . Victory: Fortes salutes the spectators as the Los Chospes ranch fighting bull dies at his feet . First to lose was David Mora. Brought . down by his first bull of the afternoon, he was gored in three places as . he was tossed around the ring like a rag doll. After . Mora was carried-off and rushed to the infirmary for emergency surgery, . Antonio Nazare followed tradition and dispatched the bull using cape . and sword. But he did so as swiftly as possible, with none of the flair audiences expect. Then . it was Nazare's turn to fight his own first bull of the afternoon. Within minutes he followed Mora to the infirmary with a single goring. Flair: After dispatching Nazare's beast, Fortes swings his cape as he fights his own bull . Ouch: But he was soon also stuck beneath the merciless charge of the bull he had intended to kill . Fortes's sword flies from his hand as the bull does its best to survive the mortal combat it has been forced into . The bullfighter is tossed into the air by a flick of the bull's neck, as both are stained red with blood . There was little the matador could do on the day to fight back against the half-tonne of pure muscle and rage he was matched up against . Not getting up: With no one left to fight the remaining bulls, there was no alternative than to cancel the rest of the corrida - the first time in 35 years that a bullfight has been stopped during the Fiesta de San Isidro . The one remaining matador, Jimenez Fortes, stepped into the ring and killed the animal, again swiftly and without flamboyance. Then his own first bull sent him flying through the air, catching him on its horns three times. After Fortes was taken to the infirmary the bull was enticed back into its stall alongside the pens of the other three who had also escaped their scheduled deaths in the afternoon. With no one left to fight them, there was no alternative than to cancel the rest of the corrida. It was the first time that had happened during San Isidro since 1979, and only the third time in the fiesta's history.","Three matadors lost to bulls in the 12th corrida of the Fiesta de San Isidro .

"A couple and their teenage son have been swept to their deaths while trying to save their dog from the sea - as their daughter and son's girlfriend watched helplessly from the shore. Mary Elena Scott, 57, and Howard Gregory Kuljian, 54, both drowned in the tragedy on Saturday afternoon at Big Lagoon, a beach by Eureka, which is 300 miles north of San Fransisco in California. A massive search for their son, Gregory James Kuljian, has now been called off, authorities said. He has not been found and is presumed dead. The dog climbed out of the water on its own. The tragedy unfolded after 10-foot waves . pulled the family's beloved dog into the sea as it chased a thrown stick, and . Gregory, known as 'Geddie' to his friends, ran in to save him.

Daughter Olivia, pictured, watched the tragedy unfold . Watching his son running towards the powerful waves, Mr Kuljian followed, said Dana Jones, a state Parks and Recreation district superintendent. The teenager was able to get . out, but when he didn't see his father, he and his mother went back into the . water looking for him. 'Both were dragged into the ocean,' Jones added. The couple's daughter, 18-year-old Olivia, and Gregory's girlfriend watched the horrifying ordeal from the beach. A . nearby bystander called 911 at 12.40pm to report that the trio was in . trouble - but by the time help arrived, nothing could be done.

The Coast Guard deployed a helicopter . and two motor life boats to search for the teenager, but the aerial . search was suspended by 7pm on Saturday due to thick coastal fog.

Scene: The family was overwhelmed by the waves at Big Lagoon, around 300 miles north of San Fransisco . The search continued on Sunday with no further discoveries. By Monday, the search had been called off, but the local Sheriff's department is periodically checking along the coast for any sign of the boy, Coast Guard Lt. Bernie Garrigan told MailOnline. Speaking to the Associated Press, he added that the search was stopped as a person without a wetsuit could not survive for long in the cold water. Signs . are posted near the beach parking lot warning families about 'sneaker . waves' - swells that seemingly appear from nowhere and smash onto the . beach, Garrigan said. 'Because . the beach is designed that way, when that 10-foot wall breaks, it . surges up on the beach and surges back really fast,' he said. 'It's like . a cyclical washing machine.' Danger zone: Signs dot the area warning people about 'sneaker waves' that creep up on beachgoers . Friends flocked to Facebook to remember the family, and launched an event, 'Wear Green for Geddie' encouraging the teenager's schoolmates to wear green to school in remembrance. Ian Johnson, who created the page, added: 'Geddie was one of the best people on this earth. His whole family was so nice and I haven’t met or heard of a single person who didn’t like him. 'Geddie was just the funniest, nicest, most amiable person that I could ever hope to have met.' The family lives in Freshwater, Eureka in California. Online records show that Howard Kuljian was a 2010 graduate student and teacher at the Department of Forestry at Humboldt State University.","Family was at Big Lagoon, a beach north of Eureka in northern California, on Saturday afternoon when dog chased a stick that had been thrown .

"The International Space Station is set to be shut down by the end of the decade thanks to the breakdown in ties between the U.S. and Russia in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. The announcement came today as six Ukrainian soldiers were killed in an ambush by militants in the village of Oktyabrski in the breakaway east of the country. At least 30 pro-Russian insurgents used grenade launchers and automatic weapons in the assault outside the town of Kramatorsk, which also left eight Ukrainian soldiers injured while the troops took part in a 'movement from a military base'. Scroll down for video . Threat: The International Space Station could close by the end of the decade thanks to U.S.-Russia tensions . Violence: Tensions continued to rise in Ukraine's east today as six Ukrainian soldiers were killed and eight more injured in an ambush by pro-Russian forces near Slaviansk (pictured) Armed: Elsewhere near Slaviansk pro-Russian gunmen stood at checkpoints around the city . Damage: Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking east is demanding greater autonomy from the Kiev government . In a statement to CNN, a military spokesman said: 'Our soldiers were attacked in an ambush. Terrorists attacked our land troops with grenades. The attackers were more than 30 people and set an ambush near the river,"" the ministry said. 'After a long shootout, six soldiers of The Ukrainian Armed Services were killed.' Russia's deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin announced a series of punitive measures against the U.S. in response to sanctions imposed after Russia annexed Crimea. The two countries have long co-operated closely on space exploration despite their clashes in foreign policy, but that era could now be coming to an end. The International Space Station is manned by both American and Russian crew, but the only way to reach it is by using Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. The U.S. is keen to keep the $100billion ISS flying until at least 2024, four years beyond its original target. However, Mr Rogozin today said that Russia would reject the request, bringing the mission to an end in 2020. Mourners have also taken to the streets of Krasnoarmeysk today as they hold funerals for pro-Russian activists killed by Ukrainian protesters over the weekend . Independence: Over the weekend Donetsk and Luhansk, two regions of Ukraine, asked to be annexed by Russia sparking violence when the National guard opened fire in Kransnoarmeysk (pictured) Hyudych Vadim Yurievichq was one of those killed, and today his relatives, including his mother (C) held a funeral . 'We are planning that we need the ISS until 2020,' said the official, who is on the sanctions list of both the U.S. and EU and recently set Russia the goal of colonising the moon. 'After 2020, we would like to divert these funds to more promising space projects.' Pointedly, Mr Rogozin - in charge of the country's defence and space industries - noted that the 'Russian segment of the ISS can exist independently from the American one, but the American section cannot exist independently of the Russian one'. Previously he has suggested that the Americans would have to use a 'trampoline' to get its astronauts into space without Russia. Mr Rogozin - a hardliner who used to be Russia's ambassador to NATO - revealed: 'We have definite interest expressed by our American colleagues on extending the work of the ISS until 2024. 'But the Federal Space Agency, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Advanced Research Foundation, are ready now to propose some new strategic aspects, connected with the further development of space exploration after 2020.' Attack: Separatist insurgents in the Ukrainian city of Slovyansk smash up machines in a gambling club . Violence: The militias have increasingly begun to dominate parts of eastern Ukraine . Uncompromising: The insurgents have expressed their opposition to control from the government in Kiev . His . announcement was a response to U.S. sanctions which will deny export . licences for any high-technology items that could aid Russian military . capabilities. Mr . Rogozin added that Russian rocket engines could no longer be exported . to the U.S. if they will be used for military satellite launches. Moscow . will also suspend the operation of GPS satellite navigation system . sites in Russia, and seek to plant sites in the U.S. for the Russian . equivalent of GPS, known as Glonass. Tensions . in Ukraine have remained high over the past few weeks, as pro-Russian . separatists in the east of the country have taken control of government . buildings. Over . the weekend, the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk both voted for . independence from Kiev in referendums which were widely denounced as . illegitimate. In . a statement today, the Russian foreign ministry said that the poll . results 'should be a clear signal to Kiev of the depth of the crisis' in . Ukraine. It . added: 'Moscow hopes the EU and United States will use their influence . on the current leadership in Kiev so that issues of state structure and . respect for the rights of regions are discussed soon.' In . another sign that the violence is unlikely to abate soon, pro-Russian . thugs were pictured using sledgehammers to destroy a gambling club in . the city of Slovyansk. Hammers: The militants used sledgehammers to crack down on what they see as immoral behaviour . Masked: The 'self-defence squads' have often taken to disguising their true identities . Defiant: Vladimir Putin's government today announced new retaliatory measures against U.S. sanctions . In a bizarre incident at the weekend, Mr Rogozin angrily accused Romania and Bulgaria of seeking to force down an official government aircraft as he returned from the breakaway pro-Russian region of Transnistria. He threatened to fly next time in a TU-160 supersonic strategic bomber. Bucharest issued a protest over his comments but the row deepened today with Mr Rogozin threatening harsh diplomatic measures against Romania, having earlier made a similar threat against Moldova, the country from which he was seeking to fly back to Moscow. 'Romania said today via Prime Minister Victor Ponta that if the premier, not the president, were in charge, he would use a destroyer to land our plane in Romania. There is nothing to talk about with them after this,' said Mr Rogozin. 'It is one thing to introduce sanctions regarding people so that they do not come and not to issue visas but to land forcefully a plane with several members of the Russian government on board using military aviation is beyond jokes and various half-serious conversations. The reaction should be most harsh.' Breakaway: Denis Pushilin, centre, claims to be head of the 'Donetsk People's Republic' in eastern Ukraine . Patrol: A tank driven by Ukrainian soldiers on the roads near Slovyansk . He claimed: 'The issue is not physical safety of a certain person - the issue is that they put under sanctions the right of Russian citizens, including those in the country's authorities and representatives of the . Russian government, to fly transit over air space of these countries. 'The pilot has informed me that when the jet entered air space of Bulgaria and Romania, dispatchers got in touch with him and demanded to report whether persons who are in the EU and U.S. sanctions list are on board.' On the way back the Romanian authorities refused to let the Russian delegation's aircraft to go through its air space, Mr Rogozin added. 'In order to facilitate the return of our delegation, I returned with a regular flight, however the jet with our delegation was sent back upon crossing the Moldovan-Ukrainian border and then subject to a search.'","Space station is set to close in 2020 after Russia announced it would refuse U.S. request to keep it open .

"THE POET'S TALE: CHAUCER AND THE YEAR THAT MADE THE CANTERBURY TALES . by Paul Strohm . (Profile Books £15.99) Perhaps it is because contemporary life is intolerable that people are flocking back to the past. They really can’t get enough of it, as the obsession with Hilary Mantel and Tudor politics demonstrates — though in my view, Mark Rylance and Damian Lewis aren’t a patch on Kenneth Williams and Sid James in Carry On Henry, which covered the same ground as Wolf Hall and more amusingly, too. ‘Has she been chaste?’ — ‘All over Normandy’, etc. When at last 16-century history begins to pall — those lutes and galliards in a Renaissance court; the King’s matrimonial wrangles and the breach with the Papacy — my bet is we’ll crank backwards another couple of hundred years and become fascinated with all things medieval. The son of a wine merchant, Chaucer grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the Thames . In anticipation of the next trend, Paul Strohm has written a pungent book about the ‘turbulence and change’ of the Middle Ages, when Latin and Norman French were mixing and merging to create the modern English language and hence the modern English identity. It was a picturesque period — the tournaments and festivities, ‘jousting and lance-play’, the ‘lavish consumption and frivolous display’: Edward III spent millions on ribbons and taffeta embroidered with jewels. The fashion was for extravagant hats and ‘outlandish coiffures’, which make Alexander McQueen look like the Salvation Army. Money came from the wool trade, ‘the nation’s most important income source’. The poet Geoffrey Chaucer worked as a controller in the wool customs and excise department, his job being to keep the accounts and collect tariffs and duties. The son of a wine merchant, Chaucer grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the Thames. He began his career in aristocratic service as ‘a genteel and versatile kind of errand runner’, known as a valet or esquire, before being promoted, as a ‘literate’ civil servant, to ‘the administrative bureaucracy of later Medieval England’. An unpromising background for an artist, you might think. But then, T. S. Eliot worked in a bank and Philip Larkin was a librarian. Strohm’s contention is that what Chaucer later wrote about in The Canterbury Tales was his direct recollection of rollicking London life — the ‘socially mixed body of pilgrims’ telling their stories, the fables, adventures and bawdy romps, were a version of what he saw going on out of his window. This is where the book comes into its own, as a description of the city of London in the year 1374, when Chaucer first went up ‘an awkward circular flight of stone stairs’ into his apartment in Aldgate — one of the many fortified gatehouses surrounding the capital, when it was encompassed by thick, stone walls. It is hard to imagine now, when London is a big splodge, but 700 years ago, Westminster was a separate place from London proper, half-a-mile away along ‘clogged footpaths’. Greenwich was a remote fishing village. Hampstead and Highgate were in the middle of deep countryside, with flocks of sheep. But, in case this starts to sound idyllic, Strohm reminds us that next to Chaucer’s Aldgate was the open sewer known as Houndsditch, named after the kennels on the bank of the Thames maintained for hunting purposes. Dead dogs were chucked in, along with the odd beggar, and ‘it stank to high heaven’. Also adjacent was the ‘extensive latrine’ maintained by Holy Trinity Church for the clergy. Add to this scene the felons’ and traitors’ heads rotting on spikes, and you realise a strong stomach was needed to survive in those germ-prone days. The noise was deafening. Iron-wheeled carts rattled beneath Chaucer’s window, as did drovers, water-carriers and wood-sellers, shouting and yelling. There were continuous processions of convicts and chanting monks, who belonged to the innumerable religious fraternities. Meals were eaten at taverns or from stalls in the street, purchased directly from street-side ovens. No health and safety regulations back then. Eating and drinking was supplemented by courtesans from ‘the stews of Southwark’ or ‘unlicensed brothels’ of Charing Cross plying their trade. To such raucousness must be added the tolling and pealing of the parish bells, which began before dawn and ended only with the night curfew. Many medieval legal cases involved trespass, disputes over boundaries and incursions on personal living space. This reflects the congestion of London — the populace fighting for a little privacy beyond the teeming and insanitary 12 ft-wide streets. With privacy difficult to obtain (few could afford secluded chambers or an enclosed garden), sex could be a bit of a free-for-all, especially after dark when lanterns were extinguished. ‘Racy incidents,’ says Strohm, ‘were part of the fodder of daily life.’ Chaucer was always writing about bottoms being thrust out of windows, ladders conveniently being left next to open casements in readiness for a tryst, rumbles behind the arras, undone breeches around the ankles and so forth. Democratic by temperament, he saw no difference between ‘a cheating wife of high degree . . . and a poor woman who engaged in the same conduct’. Both were wenches. Oh, whatever happened to wenches? I used to love a good wench, me. Barbara Windsor and Diana Dors were wenches. Chaucer described a typical damsel approvingly as frike, or frisky. He himself didn’t have much luck with the ladies, frike or otherwise. His wife, Philippa, lived apart from him in Lincoln, where she was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III’s 13-year-old queen. Possibly owing to the enforced separation, Chaucer in his poems does dwell on the ‘mistakes, misapprehensions and woes’ of the marital state. The Wife of Bath, for example, has had numerous husbands — and she’s an archetypal wench. She has a little gap between her top teeth, which was considered saucy. In 1386, at the age of 43, Chaucer was sacked, along with the other controllers who’d had their hands in the till. He left for Kent — Rochester, Sittingbourne and, of course, Canterbury — and he set down his classic saga, the ‘cacophony of competing speakers’, knights, yeomen, nuns, merchants, confidence tricksters. Before the printing press, readers were of necessity ‘few and private rather than numerous and far-flung’. The manuscript fragments were assembled only after Chaucer’s death (in 1400), copied and recopied by professional scribes (55 manuscripts exist) and finally typeset in 1473, when paper superseded parchment. Chaucer was the first writer in vernacular English, rather than in Latin. It’s not hard to follow — for example, say ‘nat worth a toord’ aloud and the meaning is plain. As Strohm says, ‘human emotions and objectives remain recognisable across time’ and, when The Canterbury Tales was filmed by Pasolini in 1972, it starred Robin Askwith of Confessions Of A Window Cleaner fame. He knew plenty about shooting up ladders, absent hubbies and the bums of wenches sticking out of windows and wardrobes.","Paul Strohm writes about the ‘turbulence and change’ of the Middle Ages .

"Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy has underlined his ambition to make a late push for the Premier League by signing free-scoring Leicester City striker Chris Wood on loan. McCarthy has exceeded expectations by taking an Ipswich team that cost £10,000 to assemble into an unlikely play-off place. But with just seven points separating the top seven clubs in the Championship, owner Marcus Evans has loosened the purse strings to allow McCarthy to sign Wood on loan, a 23-year-old New Zealand international who has scored 57 goals in 114 starts for seven different clubs including West Brom and Birmingham City.

"Dejan Lovren, the Croatian player at the centre of the penalty storm that overshadowed the opening game here in Sao Paulo, has declared that ‘they might as well give Brazil the World Cup’ now. Stunned by Yuichi Nishimura’s decision to award a penalty against him for what the Japanese referee thought was a foul on Fred, Southampton defender Lovren echoed his coach, Niko Kovac, in tearing into the official. Asked if he felt the referee had favoured the hosts, Lovren - who is a reported target for Liverpool this summer - said: ‘Maybe yes, maybe no.

I think it was two billion people. I think it is a shame. A big shame for this mistake. I cannot agree with this.’ He continued: ‘Of course I am angry. I want to cry now but what can you do? If you saw the game you saw everything so I don't need to explain. ‘I was asking the referee how can you do this to us? And then it was a shame. He didn't know what to say. The problem is that the referee doesn't speak English. ‘It is a shame that he cannot explain to me or to anyone else in English. How can any referee be in the World Cup for that?’ Lovren was supported by his central defensive partner, Vedran Corluka. ‘I think it is embarrassing,’ he said. ‘I think if this continues then no one should play against Brazil. We should just give them the World Cup and everyone can go home.’ Unhappy: Vedran Corluka (right) felt Nishimura gave every 50/50 decision in Brazil's favour on Thursday . He too was asked if he thought the referee favoured the hosts. ‘Everyone saw that, not just Croatian players,’ said Corluka. ‘Every 50/50 decision went to Brazilian players and I think Neymar elbowed Luca (Modric). After that he gives the penalty. We scored a goal, he disallowed a goal. It was quite embarrassing. Because it was the opening of the World Cup and you expect something more. ‘He was keen to give the penalty, it happens, it is over now. After that he wanted to give something to us, it was quite funny. I don't think he should be allowed to referee another game. ‘The players are disappointed. But the coach said we need to think about the second game. I congratulate Brazil but they didn't deserve to win today. Language: Lovren (centre) and Corluka have both questioned Nishimura's inability to speak English . ‘I don't blame them but I have never seen a referee in a World Cup that doesn't speak English. It is quite, I don't know how to say it, amazing. He was trying to speak to the players in Japanese. It is ridiculous. ‘He was speaking Japanese but no one could understand him because we don't have Japanese players.’","Dejan Lovren has blasted referee Yuichi Nishimura for his refereeing display .

"America's soccer team has a must-watch World Cup match against Germany kicking off at noon (EST) on Thursday and coach Jurgen Klinsmann has given everyone permission to take the day off. The USA coach sent out an absence note on Wednesday via social media for supporters - with understanding bosses - to excuse them for the day, and reminded those willing not to forget to 'wear your jersey'. The best excuse for staying at home, Klinsmann believes, is because the team 'will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch USA prepare for Germany clash... by playing football tennis . You're excused: Manager Jurgen Klinsmann had given team USA supporters permission to skip work . Good excuse: USA have progressed to the last 16 despite losing against Klinsmann's native Germany . The note, tweeted by the official @ussoccer account, reads: 'Please excuse (insert name here) from work on Thursday, June 26th. 'I understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace, but I can assure you that it is for an important cause. 'The #USMNT has a critical World Cup game vs. Germany and we will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round. 'By the way, you should act like a good leader and take the day off as well. Go USA!' When Jermaine Jones stands for the national anthems of his countries on Thursday, he will soak in the moment. Jones, like four American teammates and his coach, will be familiar with both The Star-Spangled Banner and the Deutschlandlied before the United States' World Cup game against Germany. After playing three games in 2008 for the nation in which he grew up, Jones switched allegiance to the U.S. two years later. 'When I hear the anthem from the United States, I will close my eyes and let everything go through,' the tenacious midfielder said. And then comes the big game. Four years of work by the U.S. come down to 90 or so minutes in the afternoon heat and possibly rain at Arena Pernambuco on the outskirts of a sprawling beach city known as the Brazilian Venice. Now you see stars! The back page of German daily Bild anticipates Klinsmann and his USA team will be handed a beating against Germany . Having squandered the chance to clinch advancement earlier this week against Portugal by allowing a stoppage-time goal in a 2-2 draw, the Americans might need at least a tie against the three-time champions to reach the knockout stage of consecutive World Cup for the first time. The story lines are gripping: . Mission: Klinsmann in training with his USA squad ahead of their Group G showdown for top spot . The Germans beat Portugal 4-0 and tied Ghana 2-2, leaving them with four points and a plus-four goal difference. The Americans, who defeated Ghana 2-1, have four points and a plus-one goal difference. Ghana and Portugal, with one point each, play simultaneously in Brasilia, knowing a tie in either game would eliminate both of them. U.S. Soccer Federation officials will have a system to relay the score of the other match to the bench. 'To be able to keep that level of interest for another four, five, six and hopefully more days would be great for the sport,' USSF President Sunil Gulati said. 'I think for the first time in our history - recent history, I'm not going to talk about 1950 or before - our players believe they're capable of beating anyone.' He rejects the notion the dual nationals are any less American than those who came up through the U.S. youth system. Preparation: USA can top the group but have to beat Germany to do so due to their superior goal difference . When the U.S. and Germany met for the first time in the group stage of the 1998 Cup, Klinsmann scored the second goal in a 2-0 win. The teams played four years later in the quarterfinals, when Michael Ballack's 39th-minute goal gave the Germans a 1-0 victory. The Americans still complain Scottish referee Hugh Dallas declined to call a penalty kick when Gregg Berhalter's 49th-minute shot hit the left arm of defender Torsten Frings at the goal line. While the Germans have four off days between matches, the U.S. has only three. And teams are 0-4 after games in the steamy Amazon rainforest capital of Manaus, where the Americans played Sunday night. 'It's the biggest game of all of our lives,' Beckerman said. 'Any fatigue in our legs will be erased. We've got to give it everything we've got and more.' All but through: USA know a draw would be enough to see them through for definite . There is an outside chance the U.S. and Portugal could tie for second with four points and be even on all tiebreakers - for instance, if the Americans lose 3-0 and the Portuguese win 2-0. In that case, a drawing of lots would decide which team advances. The teams that move on will have second-round matchups with Belgium, Russia, South Korea or Algeria. Gulati hopes for more, much more, that will help boost the growing American fan base. 'It's pretty easy to get emotional about,' he said, 'wanting to see this day happen. It's not The Day.

"A married mom accused of helping her white supremacist husband dump their teenage babysitter's body in the woods after a night of sex and drugs led to the girl's overdose death, has been sentenced today to up to five years in jail. Dea Millerberg, 41, was sentenced on Thursday in Ogden, Utah after she pleaded guilty in June to three felonies, including desecration of a human body. She agreed to a plea deal after testifying against her husband, 38-year-old Eric Millerberg over the murder of 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen. Millerberg, a mother of two young daughters, sobbed hysterically in court on Thursday and turned to apologize to Miss Rasmussen's mother, Dawn Miera, who had come to watch her be sent to jail. Dea Millerberg, convicted of helping her husband dump their teenage babysitter's body in the woods after a night of sex and drugs, burst into tears during her sentencing today in Utah . Millerberg, 41, arrives at 2nd District Court on Thursday in Ogden, Utah. Millerberg was given five years for helping dispose of their teen babysitter's body with her husband . Millerberg and her husband had a drug-fueled, salacious sexual relationship with the teenager that led to her death from an overdose in 2011. Her husband, 38-year-old Eric Millerberg, is serving up to life in prison after he was found guilty of child abuse homicide and other charges. Mrs Millerberg also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and obtaining a prescription illegally in June. Alexis Rasmussen, 16, reportedly asked the Millerbergs how to get meth and they started smoking the drug, along with heroin and marijuana, with the girl. When she overdosed, they dumped her body in the woods . Dawn Miera, mother of Alexis Rasmussen, speaks with reporters after a state judge sentenced 41-year-old Dea Millerberg on Thursday for helping dump her daughter's body after a drug overdose . Weber County Attorney Dee Smith said during in June that he considered the plea bargain was a fair deal considering that Millerberg helped prosecutors get her husband convicted. During a three-day trial in February, prosecutors brought detectives, medical examiners, prisoners and Dea Millerberg to the stand to show that Eric Millerberg recklessly injected Rasmussen with lethal doses of heroin and methamphetamine during a night of sex and drugs. Rasmussen had seven times the lethal amount of methamphetamine in her system and high levels of morphine and amphetamines, and that likely caused her death, a medical examiner said. Prosecutors told jurors that Eric Millerberg and his wife then dumped Rasmussen's body in the woods of northern Utah while lying to police as the girl's mother desperately searched for her for more than a month. Eric Millerberg was sentenced to life in March for child abuse homicide - a first-degree felony and one to 15 years for obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. Millerberg appeared in disbelief today when she was sentenced. She broken down in court and apologized to the teenager's mother . He was also sentenced to two terms of zero to five years for the unlawful and statutory rape of a 16-or-17-year-old - and abuse or desecration of a human body, third-degree felonies. The sentences are consecutive. On his part, Millerberg, 38, showed no sign of emotion as the judge sentenced him for killing Lexi Rasmussen, 16, by injecting her with a lethal dose of drugs in September of 2011. Millerberg's wife Dea was also in the house at the same time getting high when Miss Rasmussen fell unconscious and died. The two grabbed her body, stuffed it in to a trash bag, bundled it in the trunk of their car and dumped it in a remote rural location. Miss Rasmussen was found 38 days later. Dea said the couple started using Alexis - or Lexi as she called her - as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011. The two faces of evil: Eric Millerberg recklessly injected Rasmussen with lethal doses of heroin and methamphetamine during a night of sex and drugs. When she died, he dumped her body in a trash bag. Left, he is pictured when he is arrested and right, after cleaning up for trial . They became friends and started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with the teen before Alexis began requesting that they try harder drugs like methamphetamine and heroin. Eventually they began paying Alexis with meth. According to Salt Lake Tribune, Dea testified that on the night of the girl's death, she had picked up Alexis to baby sit her kids. She said as soon as Alexis arrived at the house, Eric Millerberg helped her get high by injecting her with drugs - once with heroin and twice with meth - into her arm and neck. Then, when she was ‘as high as she had ever been’, the girl and Eric Millerberg performed oral sex on one another. Dea said that she was not involved in the encounter. A short while later, the drugs had a negative effect on the teen and she started ‘freaking out’. She reportedly felt disoriented and cold, so she asked if she could take a warm bath in the couple’s master bathroom. After leaving her alone in the bath at her request, the Millerbergs checked on her about 45 minutes later to find that she was still cold, so Dea wrapped her in a blanket and told her to lie down in another bedroom. The couple left her to smoke cigarettes, and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive. ‘She wasn't breathing. She had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth,’ said Dea, who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail. They then tried to figure out what to do next. ‘It really was a panic. The idea of it was, we will lose our kids and go to jail, and there was nothing we could do to bring her back,’ she told the court. Eric Millerberg was on parole at the time for burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang. The girl was found with her legs folded against her in a fetal position, her lower half stuffed into a garbage bag. Utah assistant medical examiner Joseph White testified on Friday that the girl’s body was so badly decomposed, it was difficult to identify her. Dental records and a fingerprint analysis finally led to a positive identification. A toxicologist testified that reports showed she had ingested meth at least 24 hours before her death. The couple- along with their toddler- drove around extensively disposing of Alexis' body and all evidence. She was found here in Morgan County six weeks after her death .","Dea Millerberg, 41, was sentenced today in Ogden, Utah after she pleaded guilty in June to three felonies, including desecration of a human body .

"Created: . 05:55 EST, 12 May 2014 . Britain’s supermarket 'price war' has been revealed as a sham, with chains increasing the costs of thousands of products, despite promising lower prices. Asda and Tesco have spent millions publicising falling price tags for shoppers so far this year. But in a ten-week period since February 23, the two retail giants and Sainsbury’s reduced the price on 3,057 items, but increased it on 3,653, industry analysts have revealed. The supermarket giants reduced the price on 3,057 items but increased it on 3,653, industry analysts have revealed. Only Sainsbury's lowered a greater number of products . Sham: Tesco, which uses the slogan 'prices down and staying down' has cut 1,012 price tags but hiked up 1,350 others . Sainsbury’s, who recently played down the price war, can boast more reductions than increases - 965 items are down and 704 are up. And Morrisons have cut more than double the number of products it increased, having recently announced a further 1,200 price cuts under a new 'I'm cheaper' campaign. The others, who have been the loudest in their claims, cannot say the same, revealed data from analysts BrandView.com for industry journal The Grocer. Asda have said they are spending £1billion over the next five years to cut prices, but since February 23 it has cut the cost of 1,080 items and increased it on 1,599. Tesco, which uses the slogan ‘prices down and staying down’ has cut 1,012 price tags but hiked up 1,350 others. According to the research, many . products would be cheaper if customers take up special offers and deals, . such as Buy One Get One Free promotions. But . excluding these, rises outnumber cuts on the shelves of the nation’s . biggest retailers, despite the much publicised price war, said study. Lowering prices: Sainsbury's, who recently played down the price war, can boast more reductions than increases - 965 items are down and 704 are up . The retail giants claim the cuts are to the most popular items such as bread and milk and eggs which means the average basket of groceries does cost less now. The Grocer said: ‘Overall, they (the Big Four) have actually increased more prices than they have cut. ‘Prices have fallen when looking at a basket of 60 of the biggest selling products by value across alcohol, health, fresh, ambient, frozen, household and toiletries.’ Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King recently described his company’s policy as ‘price skirmishes’ rather than a price war. As a result, the supermarket has more price cuts than price rises but the cost of a basket of the top 60 goods at Sainsbury’s is up 2.5 per cent in the same period. The same basket is down 7.7 per cent at Asda and 2.4 per cent at Tesco. A spokesman for Tesco said: ‘Our own data covers 40,000 products and clearly shows that our prices overall have come down over this period. ‘On top of that, our price cuts are focused on the products that customers buy most often, like bread, milk and eggs and are down by an average of 24 per cent.’ An Asda spokesman said: 'The price of some products does change from time to time for various reasons including seasonality but two years ago, we locked the price of every day essentials and since then those prices have stayed the same, such as four pints of milk at £1, which is why we’re nearly 8% cheaper in this survey.'‬ .","Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's reduced cost on 3,057 items .

"Killer: Adam Lanza may have been copying a video game when he opened fire on students and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School . Police investigating the Newtown school killings have been looking into the possibility that gunman Adam Lanza may have been copying a video game as killed 26 people in the massacre. Two months after the horror at Sandy Hook Elementary School, little remains known about Lanza's motive. Before the killings, he had smashed his hard drive, making his online trail and habits impossible to follow, but police did reportedly find thousands of dollars worth of violent video games. It is believed that Lanza played the games, which included the Call of Duty series, for hours on end. Along with the video games, Adam Lanza also learned how to fire guns during numerous sessions with his mother Nancy Lanza at a shooting range, where the two 'bonded.' The Hartford Courant reported today that detectives are probing whether Lanza may have been copying a scenario from one of those video games as he fired rounds from his mother's Bushmaster assault rifle in two classrooms at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14. Her landscaper Dan Holmes told the paper: 'She said she took her kids target shooting, that they bonded over that.' Lanza, who was 20 years old, is the face . behind the ruthless murder of 20 first-graders, six adults and his own . mother that shook the quiet Connecticut town. He then turned one of his weapons on himself as police closed in. Nancy Lanza was Adam's first victim on the morning of the Newtown killings, shot dead in her bed at extremely close range, possibly while she was asleep. Before that, she was seen as a dedicated mother to Adam, who had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and a sensory integration disorder (an aversion to bright lights and loud noises), according to the Courant. Mother: Nancy Lanza had taken her son to a shooting range for years, and was shot dead by her son with one of her own guns . Killer: Adam Lanza shot his mother in her bed before gunning down 20 children and six staff at Sandy Hook elementary school on December 14 . She had enrolled and pulled Adam into . numerous schools over the years after growing unsatisfied with the . education he was receiving. She was planning a move to Washington state with the hopes of getting her son back into a college program. But Adam Lanza also received an education on weapons from his mother, who took him target shooting at a gun range for years. Richard Novia, a security chief in the Newtown School system who moderated the tech club - of which Adam had been a member - said he disagreed with Nancy Lanza's recreation with her son. He told the Courant: 'It's a serious mistake, first of all. If you have a child in the home with mental disorders, or learning disabilities, to have involved him with guns in the first place would be bad.' Days after the Sandy Hook shooting, Nancy Lanza's sister-in-law Marsha revealed that she had traveled to nine cities in three countries because she wanted out of the mansion she shared with her troubled son Adam - and could have known the end was coming. House of horrors: It is thought that Nancy was planning a move from their house in Newtown, pictured, for Washington state to find a place for Adam to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled 20-year-old . Victims: Top row, left to right; Ana Marquez-Greene, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos, Emilie Parker, Noah Pozner. Second row: Jesse Lewis, Olivia Engel, Josephine Gay, Charlotte Bacon, Chase Kowalski. Third row: Daniel Barden, Jack Pinto, Catherine Hubbard, Dylan Hockley, Benjamin Wheeler. Fourth row: Grace McDonnell, James Mattioli, Avielle Richman, Rachel Davino, Anne Marie Murphy. Fifth row: Lauren Rousseau, Mary Sherlach, Victoria Soto, Dawn Hochsprung, Nancy Lanza . More victims: Madeline Hsu, six, left, and Allison Wyatt, also six, right, were shot dead on December 14 at their school . It is believed that Nancy - who was . suffering from multiple sclerosis - wanted to downsize and find a place . for him to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled . 20-year-old. Nancy, who herself had been diagnosed . with MS, supposedly had a 'charmed upbringing' in Kingston, New . Hampshire, where her mother was the school nurse. She married her high school . sweetheart Peter Lanza and they moved to Newtown, Connecticut, in 1999 . where they moved into a $1.5million Colonial property. Ten years later however they divorced - but Nancy’s troubles were only just beginning. Speaking . to MailOnline Marsha Lanza, from Crystal Lake, Illinois, said: ‘Nancy . opened up with me and told me she had been diagnosed with MS. ‘This was a few years ago but I don't think many of the family knew. She wasn't someone to make a fuss. She accepted life as it was. Horror: Crying children are led from Sandy Hook Elementary, where Lanza opened fire on the morning of December 14 . In a Facebook conversation seen by MailOnline, Nancy also gave the most revealing account of her own family problems and how they may have shaped her life . ‘Over the last year she suddenly seemed to be traveling a lot. I know she went to England and was all over the US. ‘There . was no sign her health was getting worse. She still looked beautiful, . so full of life, but maybe she felt time was running out.’ The Facebook conversation seems to . back this up. On October 9, Nancy wrote to Marsha that she had been to . ‘a little bit of everywhere.' Peter made $445,000 a year and agreed to pay $240,000 a year in alimony and child support, according to court records . She . wrote: ‘Boston, New York, Maine, Toronto, London, San Francisco, . Nantucket, Charlotte, Baltimore...that covers this year : )’ Nancy also talked about wanting to move to a smaller house but did not want to sell her home at a loss. When she married her high school . sweetheart Peter Lanza in 1981, the couple built a house next door to the home where . they lived until they moved to Newtown. She moved to Newtown with her husband . Peter in 1998. He would commute to the city for his job at General Electric. The . couple divorced in 2009 after their marriage 'irretrievably broke . down'. Peter made $445,000 a year and agreed to pay $240,000 a year in . alimony and child support, according to court records. This was likely due to the cost of Adam's care. Adam Lanza, 20, had lived his whole . life at the $1.4million home in Newtown where he killed his mother while . she lay in bed in her pajamas. Nancy Lanza was described as a 'gun enthusiast' who taught Adam, who had autism-related Asperger's Syndrome, how to shoot.

"A drug dealer caught with a huge block of cannabis when he was in a serious car crash is in line for a multi-million pound payout. The Department of Transport had been trying to stop Sean Delaney profiting from the injuries he suffered in the smash. But yesterday a judge ruled this would have breached EU directives and the 40-year-old father of five should receive compensation despite the ‘public revulsion’. Delaney was a passenger in a speeding £80,000 Mercedes roadster driven by a fellow drug dealer who overtook on a bend and ploughed into a car carrying a family. Ruling: A judge at the High Court said Delaney is entitled to compensation . Peter and Lisa Houston and their three . children all suffered serious injuries as well but were awarded only . £20,000 between them. In the judgment at the High Court in London, Mr Justice Jay said: ‘Many readers may be wondering how it comes about that a drug dealer is entitled to compensation against Her Majesty’s Government in circumstances where he was injured during the course of a criminal joint enterprise. ‘The understandable reaction might be: There must be some rule of public policy, reflecting public revulsion, which bars such a claim. The short answer is that there is not.’ Delaney, from Bedworth, Warwickshire, suffered fractures, ruptured organs, amnesia and ‘intellectual blunting’ in the November 2006 crash near Nuneaton. Mr Justice Jay said: 'Readers might think: There must be a rule reflecting public revulsion which bars such a claim. There is not' When he and the driver, Shane Pickett, were cut free from the wreckage, a small package of cannabis was found hidden in Pickett’s sock and a block the size of a football in Delaney’s bomber jacket. Pickett was jailed for ten months for dangerous driving and possessing cannabis. No action was taken against Delaney, probably because of the severity of his injuries. He demanded compensation from Pickett’s insurers but they invoked an exclusion clause in that Pickett was under the influence of cannabis and driving dangerously. Delaney’s lawyers sued the Secretary of State for Transport, claiming the exclusion under a clause of the UK Uninsured Drivers’ Agreement was incompatible with the 2009 European Motor Insurance Directive which, in the interests of standardisation, allows no exclusions. The 1999 agreement helps innocent victims of uninsured drivers obtain compensation. In 2011 the Court of Appeal found against Delaney saying he would, or should, have known the Mercedes was being used for ‘the furtherance of crime’. But yesterday Mr Justice Jay ruled in his favour, saying the Department’s failure to ensure uniformity between UK law and the EU directives was ‘so serious that ... it must pay compensation to Mr Delaney’. The court found the illegality involved in the journey itself was merely ‘scene setting’ and not the cause of the accident. But Delaney’s Tory MP Dan Byles said: ‘I’m sure I speak for the majority of my constituents who would be horrified that a drug dealer is getting extremely large amounts of taxpayers’ money for what is essentially a self-inflicted injury. It seems highly unfair.’ Dominic Raab, the eurosceptic Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said it was absurd ‘criminals can sue the government at huge taxpayers’ expense for harm suffered in the course of committing their crimes’. He said it added ‘insult to injury that this nonsense is being forced on us by Brussels contrary to all notions of basic democratic accountability’. Accident: Delaney was being driven in a 'flashy' Mercedes SL 500 (left, posed by model) when it crashed. On rescuing him, emergency services found 240 grams of cannabis (right, file photo) The amount of compensation the Department must now pay Delaney will be assessed at a later date, but millions are routinely awarded in cases of such serious injury. The Houston family, from Exhall, near Bedworth, were hospitalised after the crash with broken bones, collapsed lungs and bruised kidneys. Yesterday Mr Houston said he was surprised by the judgment. ‘If Delaney is getting multi millions then it is quite disappointing when we didn’t get anything near that,’ said the salesman. ‘It seems stupid that the loophole is allowed to exist and the EU law allows him to get that money.’ The family received a new car on top of their compensation, which came from a pot built up by the Motor Insurers Bureau under the uninsured drivers agreement. When approached at his semi-detached home, Delaney claimed he had not heard about his court victory. ‘All I can say is I’m in shock,’ he said. ‘I haven’t been able to work for eight years because apparently I’ve got a brain injury. I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong but apparently there is.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘We thought that the directive was drafted in a wide-enough way to allow governments some autonomy. We are considering an appeal.’","Sean Delaney, 40, was passenger in 'flashy' Mercedes when it crashed .

"Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon was suspended for at least one year by the National Football League on Tuesday for violating the substance abuse policy. Gordon, who was banned by the NFL from consuming alcohol after pleading guilty to driving while impaired last July, tested positive for what he called a one-off session of moderate alcohol consumption on a private jet last month. The ban will keep him out of the entire 2015 season. Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon will miss the entire 2015 season after being banned by the NFL .

"The shell casing of a bullet was found in a car rented by former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez on the day he is accused of murdering Odin Lloyd. Keelia Smyth, former manager of an Enterprise rental car branch in North Attleborough, Boston, told the court on Wednesday that Hernandez returned a damaged Nissan Altima on the afternoon of June 17, 2013. In it, she says, was something she believed to be a bullet stuck to a piece of chewed blue gum and a child's drawing. Accused: Aaron Hernandez allegedly left the casing of a bullet in his rental car after the death of Odin Lloyd . Enterprise worker Keelia Smyth told Bristol County Superior Court on Wednesday about her alleged finding . 'Evidence': This is a picture shown to the court on Wednesday of the casing police recovered on June 20 . Hernandez had offered her a piece of blue gum before he left, she said. The testimony came as police were questioned over their handling of evidence, which has been a crucial element of the trial. Smyth told the court Hernandez made no attempt to conceal his identity when he returned the car on June 18, asking for an SUV instead. When she cleaned the car, she said, there was a 'bullet' stuck to a piece of blue chewing gum, and a child's drawing. Before Hernandez left, she says, he offered her a piece of blue gum, which she declined. She threw it all in the trash but when she heard of Hernandez's arrest, called police describing her alleged discovery, the Boston Globe reported. Officers said they found a .45-caliber shell casing, chewing gum, and a child's drawing in the dumpster on June 20. Smyth told the court Hernandez made no attempt to conceal his identity when he returned the car on June 18 . The court also heard from Hernandez's uncle who said the player was upset about losing his endorsements . Hernandez is charged with the June 17, 2013, killing of Lloyd, who was dating the sister of his fiancee . Gum: Smyth claims Hernandez offered her a piece of blue gum before she found the casing stuck to gum . The items were placed in the bed of a State Police pick-up truck - a move which both the prosecution and defense teams have criticised. 'It was just a dirty old pickup truck, right?' defense lawyer James Sultan asked police detective Michael Elliott. 'Has anyone ever taught you to collect evidence that way, sir?' 'No,' Elliott said. Hernandez is charged with the June 17, 2013, killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Odin Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park in June 2013. Requested an SUV: She said Hernandez returned the car asking for an SUV on June 18, 2013 . Resuming the murder trial on Wednesday, prosecution first heard from Ms Smyth, who said Hernandez first rented the Nissan Altima on June 10, 2013. She said he requested an SUV when he returned it on June 18. Smyth claims she offered him a Kia Soul, as no SUVs were available, but Hernandez replied that 'he couldn't be seen dead in that'. He took a Chrysler 300. Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested on murder and firearms charges. The team cut him hours later. Police have yet to find the gun in question, which is proving to be a major set back for both defense and prosecution. In a blow to prosecution, Bristol Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled on Wednesday that Hernandez's friend Robert Paradis could not testify that he knew about the gun. He took to the stand in absence of the jury to clarify that police had overstretched his comments in their report, and that he couldn't be sure of Hernandez's connection to a .45 caliber gun. It was believed Hernandez had told Paradis he owned a .45 caliber gun. Paradis admitted that he cannot recall if it was specifically .45 caliber, and that he never saw the gun in question.

"A kitesurfer is today fighting for his life after he was launched 100ft and slammed into a building after his equipment was caught by a freak gust of wind. The unnamed man, in his early 30s, had just stepped out of the water when his kite suddenly filled with air, dragging him 30 metres along a beach and into a metal sign on the promenade. He was then lifted 10ft into the air and thrown into a building before falling back down and landing on a metal hand rail and some dustbins. Desperate: Paramedics and lifeguards battle to help the critically injured kitesurfer, who was launched 100ft and slammed into a building at Poole harbour in Dorset . Shocked members of the public and two beach lifeguards raced to his side and found him unconscious but breathing. He was airlifted to hospital with serious head injuries. A spokesman for the RNLI, whose two lifeguards helped the victim, said: 'A male kitesurfer had just come out of the water when a gust of wind unexpectedly caught his kite. 'He was then picked up by the kite and dragged approximately 30 metres towards the promenade before hitting a blue beach information sign. 'He was then lifted 10ft and hit a building. From here he fell around 10ft on to hand rails and bins with enough force to break the bins' metal bracket.' Rescue: The Coastguard helicopter flew the victim, who is yet to be named, to Southampton Hospital . The incident happened at 12.20pm yesterday in Poole Harbour, a popular watersports venue. Rare: Kitesurfing (file pic) can be dangerous but accidents like the one in Poole do not happen often, experts say . The RNLI spokesman added: 'The lifeguards carried out checks and found the patient was unconscious but breathing. 'They then administered oxygen, just as the ambulance arrived and took over control of the situation. 'A decision was made to call the coastguard helicopter due to the potential of the casualty having suffered a spinal injury following the incident.' The kitesurfer was flown to Southampton General Hospital where his injuries were described as life-threatening. Richard Gower, chairman of the British Kitesurfing Association, said: 'It was not that windy yesterday but there were squalls. 'The kites are very powerful but there is an emergency system to depower them. It seems this kitesurfer couldn't activate his for some reason. 'Accidents like this are fairly rare. They usually come about due to user error or other circumstances such as weather conditions. 'Unfortunately they often involve people who are fairly new to the sport. 'Most accidents within kitesurfing happen on land - they rarely happen on the water. 'When a kitesurfer is on the land it's the most critical time, and we do encourage everyone to look out for one another.'","Man, in his 30s, was treated on the pavement in Poole after freak accident .

"Match of the Day Two presenter Mark Chapman on Sunday night moved to clarify why the BBC had not shown Bradford's FA Cup giant killing against Sunderland live on TV. The Bantams knocked out another Premier League club following their 4-2 win over Chelsea in the fourth round to book their place in the last eight of the competition. But the BBC came in for criticism because the 2-0 win against Gus Poyet's side was one of only three fifth-round ties not to feature on live TV, either on the BBC or BT Sport. Mark Chapman confirmed on Match of the Day Two that Bradford was not selected for TV because the BBC had to choose the live games before their opponents were known . Bradford goalscorer Jon Stead joked during his post-match interview that the fifth-round tie against Sunderland should have been shown on TV . Bradford striker Jon Stead joked during his post-match interview for BBC that the game at Valley Parade was 'a great cup tie' and that it 'should have been on the TV', a comment that left the interviewer lost for words. Back in the studio Chapman revealed the reason why Chelsea's conquerors from the previous round had not been shown live, despite the opportunity of another upset being on the cards. 'I do have an answer on that subject,' the presenter said. 'And it comes from the BBC football management who say the following: ""They had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore couldn’t be sure who Bradford would be at home to. If they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it"".' Gary Lineker and Mark Chapam were subject to a cheeky tweet from Bradford City following their FA Cup win . Match of the Day 2 presenter Mark Chapman was also targeted by Bradford's cheeky tweet . Sunderland needed a replay to beat Championship side Fulham in the fourth round and the BBC had to select the live games before the tie was decided, with the corporation instead opting to show the all Premier League clash between Aston Villa and Leicester. Gary Lineker had earlier claimed the BBC would have screened Bradford's  fifth-round clash had their opponents been known prior to the fourth-round replays. And the League One side didn't let him forget it by posting a cheeky tweet aimed at Lineker and  Chapham following the Sunderland win. The presenter tweeted: 'The BBC can only show 2 ties in each round and select them pre replays. If they could've waited Bradford would obviously have been chosen.' Billy Clarke (centre) fires Bradord ahead with the help of a deflection during their victory over Sunderland .

Filmed singing are you watching BBC. Sorry'. Lineker led the BBC's coverage from Villa Park as the home side held on for a 2-1 victory in a match that only came to life in the final stages.

"For years, West Ham have been famously known as the Academy of Football, renowned for producing great talents — but in future Tottenham could be hailed as the new production line. Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Michael Carrick and Joe Cole are just a few of the household names who have come through the ranks at Upton Park. But the Hammers were forced to sell them all and have struggled to keep the same standard of players progressing into the first-team.

In stark contrast and just a few miles down the road, their London rivals and today’s opponents Tottenham are now reaping the rewards of a successful youth set-up. Former manager Tim Sherwood should be given a lot of credit for the way he managed the development phase, but the internal structure has allowed the likes of Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb to become a key part of the first team this season. Kane in particular has been one of the star performers in the Premier League this season, scoring 23 goals in all competitions, and is expected to break into the England squad next month. Mauricio Pochettino  substitute Harry Kane during the  Europa League Round  match against Fiorentina . Mauricio Pochettino is no stranger to bringing through the best home-grown talent following the superb job he did at Southampton and sees no reason why Tottenham cannot go one stage further and produce a team full of English players in years to come. Pochettino said: ‘This is possible in the future. If they have the quality and deserve to play then why not? ‘Our philosophy is to give young talent the opportunity. To have a lot of players from the academy is good. ‘We have more players who may have the opportunity to play in the first team.’ Fiorentina's Argentinan defender Jose Basanta vies with Tottenham Hotspur's English striker Kane . Another player to have come through the ranks at Tottenham is Andros Townsend. The England winger says they are inspired by the Class of ’92 at Manchester United which saw the likes of David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers all in the same team. Townsend said: ‘Of course it’s a great inspiration but those players went on to become the greatest players in the country. They’re a great inspiration for us but there are no comparisons. ‘It’s great to be playing with players you grew up with and you played with in the youth teams.’ Tottenham winger Andros Townsend says they are inspired by the Class of ’92 at Manchester United .","For years West Ham have been known as the Academy of Football .

A dying Irish girl’s last dream came true when her favourite pop star sang to her over the phone shortly before she passed away. Triona Priestley, 15, from Dublin, lost her battle with cystic fibrosis minutes after singer Ed Sheeran sang her a song she loved - Little Bird. One of her friends, Lucy Hanlon, revealed Triona’s heart-breaking last minutes. She wrote on Facebook: ‘It is with great sadness that I have to share with you all today – our beautiful angel was taken from us. ‘As we all know about the Twitter campaign, Ed’s manager Stuart Camp emailed me and today Ed rang Triona and personally sang Little Bird to her as she took her last breaths. ‘Triona left us listening to her idol surrounded by all the  people who loved her. ‘People’s respect is incredible. We would like to thank everyone. Goodnight, my angel. Sleep tight.’ There had been a widespread Twitter campaign with the hashtag #SongForTri after her friends wrote online about Triona’s last wish. It is understood that Sheeran rang the teenager and sang her favourite song to her. The singer later commented on Triona’s passing on his Twitter page, saying: ‘Rest in peace Triona, so heartbreaking x’ Previously he had written: ‘Get well soon dude and I’ll see you when I’m over in October xx.’ The young girl’s mother Bernie said: ‘She is so proud her friends did this for her, she gave us a big smile when she found out.’ She also said: ‘From birth, Triona has been in and out of hospital but it didn’t affect [her brother] Colm in the same way.

Her hero: Well known cystic fibrosis campaigner Orla Tinsley (pictured) said Triona had dealt with her condition by writing 'deeply affecting' poetry . ‘She has missed a lot of classes and she has a lot of admissions to hospital and that’s why I got involved in trying to support any kind of initiative Temple Street's Children's University Hospital have in upgrading any kind of physical environment that the kids have to be put in.’ #SongForTri trended on Twitter since this weekend as thousands of Triona’s friends and family joined forces to try and contact the singer and make her dream happen.

Froch, meanwhile, is negotiating for two major defences of his WBA world title against Bernard Hopkins at the City Ground and Julio Cesar Chavez Jr in Las Vegas. Hearn confirmed also that George Groves is declining the possible opportunity of being the opponent for DeGale in the fight for the vacant IBF title. Groves, who narrowly defeated DeGale in their first grudge match, was second in line behind No 2 contender, Andre Dirrell. Negotiations with Dirrell to meet DeGale have already commenced, although the American is wary of returning to England after believing he was robbed of a decision against Froch in Nottingham. Hearn says: 'We will get a decision on Dirrell quickly by pressing for purse bids if he wants this agreement. Froch has vacated his IBF world title having not fought since beating George Groves last May . Froch had been due to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in March but had to withdraw with an injury .","James DeGale will fight on April 25 at London's O2 Arena .

"The BBC is in discussions with the Football Association about how to make it easier to choose the most exciting FA Cup fixtures to broadcast live. The broadcaster received criticism for not showing Bradford's shock 2-0 victory over Sunderland in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday, electing instead to show Aston Villa's match against Leicester. BBC football editor Mark Cole released a statement on Monday afternoon which can be read in full below. Billy Clarke (centre) fires Bradford ahead with the help of a deflection during their victory over Sunderland . Jon Stead (right) seals the tie with a neat finish to complete the FA Cup fifth round giant killing . Phil Parkinson was the mastermind of yet another cup shock with Bradford City at the Valley Parade . The statement comes after Match of the Day Two presenter Mark Chapman on Sunday night moved to clarify why the BBC had not shown Bradford's FA Cup giant killing against Sunderland live on TV. Bradford striker Jon Stead joked during his post-match interview for BBC that the game at Valley Parade was 'a great cup tie' and that it 'should have been on the TV', a comment that left the interviewer lost for words. Back in the studio Chapman revealed the reason why Chelsea's conquerors from the previous round had not been shown live, despite the opportunity of another upset being on the cards. 'I do have an answer on that subject,' the presenter said. 'And it comes from the BBC football management who say the following: 'They had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore couldn't be sure who Bradford would be at home to. If they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it'.' Mark Chapman confirmed on Match of the Day Two that Bradford was not selected for TV because the BBC had to choose the live games before their opponents were known . Bradford goalscorer Stead joked during his post-match interview that the fifth-round tie against Sunderland should have been shown on TV . Sunderland needed a replay to beat Championship side Fulham in the fourth round and the BBC had to select the live games before the tie was decided, with the corporation instead opting to show the all Premier League clash between Aston Villa and Leicester. Gary Lineker had earlier claimed the BBC would have screened Bradford's  fifth-round game had their opponents been known prior to the fourth-round replays. And the League One side didn't let him forget it by posting a cheeky tweet aimed at Lineker and  Chapman following the Sunderland win. The presenter tweeted: 'The BBC can only show 2 ties in each round and select them pre replays. If they could've waited Bradford would obviously have been chosen.' Gary Lineker and Mark Chapman were subject to a cheeky tweet from Bradford City following their victory . Match of the Day 2 presenter Chapman was also targeted by Bradford's cheeky tweet . The TV match selections for the 5th round of the FA Cup caused a bit of a reaction yesterday, so I wanted to use this post to explain in a bit more detail how the selection process works. You still might not agree with our picks, particularly if you're from Bradford, but hopefully you'll see there's a bit of logic to what we try to do. As Gary Lineker mentioned yesterday, the hardest thing is that both the BBC and BT have to make our selections before the outcome of replays. That's the only reason why Phil Parkinson's side didn't get a live match this time round. We had to weigh up the options and given Sunderland's recent form, thought it was a realistic possibility of the match being League One against a Championship side. In this case it wouldn't have been much of a shock whatever the result and the winners would be guaranteed a live Quarter-Final, as Reading have done by progressing at Derby. If Bradford definitely had a home tie against Premier League opposition we certainly would have chosen to have the match live on BBC One. That has been a big part of our policy so far, showing AFC Wimbledon, Cambridge, Bristol City and tonight Preston, all looking to overcome opposition from the top flight. As the game unfolded yesterday at Valley Parade, we shared the frustration of fans and would have loved to have been broadcasting the match live. It's everything the FA Cup and our new comprehensive coverage is about. We are speaking to the FA about whether we can change this in the future, but understand it's tricky for them. Clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing, policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for TV companies to confirm their selections. But we hope there's a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like yesterday. Of course a lot of things are easy in hindsight. We have been really pleased with most of our picks so far and really fortunate to get some proper cup shocks. Warrington from the eighth tier overcoming Exeter City, Blyth Spartans winning in dramatic fashion at Hartlepool, AFC Wimbledon running Liverpool close and Cambridge holding Manchester United under the Abbey Stadium lights. It's also great to see the difference the TV money can make to these clubs, as well as placing them in the national spotlight with over 7 million viewers tuning in. Our audience research also suggests that fans want to enjoy a mix of these David vs. Goliath matches and games involving Premier League sides. For those who can't afford subscription to sports channels, it's been great to be able to see live international stars like Alexis Sanchez, Angel Di Maria, Steven Gerrard, Ron Vlaar and Alex Song, all as part of the licence fee. While the Aston Villa vs. Leicester game wasn't everyone's cup of tea, it was a hotly contested Midlands derby with both clubs picking full strength sides and produced a cracking second half watched by over 4 million. Of course, we would have loved to have been live at Chelsea in the 4th round and Bradford in the 5th, but the good news for fans is that even when a game isn't shown live there's always comprehensive Match of the Day highlights available. There's a lot more extra coverage devoted to the FA Cup on the BBC, with lots of additional content and different ways to enjoy it. After the 4th round, 26 million people had watched the coverage on the BBC, that's 8 million more than on terrestrial TV this time last season. It's not all about viewing figures and ratings, but it's pleasing to be able to bring coverage of the world's most loved cup competition to such a wide audience. Despite some of the criticism coming out of Bradford, a lot of thought goes into the matches we pick, and I hope the selections outlined above show we are particularly keen to showcase clubs outside the Premier League. I'm a Bristol Rovers fan myself so know all too well what the cup can mean to those outside the elite. When we sit down tomorrow morning to pick our two matches for the Quarter-Final we will take all I've discussed into consideration, but the good news is that all four matches will be live on TV. That means Bradford's incredible heroics over the last five rounds have guaranteed them a money-spinning Quarter-Final game and boy do Bantams fans deserve it!","The BBC received criticism for not showing Bradford's shock victory against Sunderland in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday .

"Tim Sherwood stared straight ahead, unmoved for what seemed an eternity as Victor Moses rolled in Stoke’s stoppage-time penalty to suck the hope out of his debut as Aston Villa manager. ‘Devastated,’ he explained later, never one to under-sell a description. His face on the touchline as his first match ended in defeat illustrated as much. Just when it seemed Villa would claim a point, underwhelming in the circumstances but important in the grand scheme, they left with none. Victor Moses celebrates his penalty that gave Stoke City a late winner at Villa Park as Tim Sherwood lost his first game in charge . Scott Sinclair celebrates putting Aston Villa ahead at Villa Park in new manager Sherwood's official first game in charge . Mame Biram Diouf equalised for Stoke City, and here he is congratulated by Victor Moses jumping on the forward's back . Stoke's late winner saw Sherwood disappointed to lose his first game in charge of the goal-shy home side at Villa Park .

How Mame Biram Diouf equalised for Stoke. Click here for more MATCH ZONE . Ron Vlaar erred to allow a marauding Moses possession inside the Villa box, then tried to make amends with a diving tackle that only resulted referee Roger East pointing to the spot and producing a red card. In the third minute of added time, Moses sent Brad Guzan the wrong way and the final whistle was swiftly followed by the boos that have frequently echoed around this stadium. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. It is 11 Premier League games without victory for Villa. As bouncy as Sherwood had been in the build-up to this game, his demeanour in the aftermath showed the opposite extreme. ‘No-one feels as down as I am,’ he said. ‘No-one.’ He added: ‘It is not all rosy in the garden obviously here, nobody said it was going to be easy. It was a cruel way to lose the game but in the end I thought neither team deserved to win.’ That summation is probably correct, even though Stoke once again illustrated their threat away from the Britannia. This was a fifth win on the road this season, the club’s best total in Premier League history, and all the more impressive given Villa had taken the lead. Villa's team-sheet strangely included Kevin Richardson (No 18), a former Villa player who appeared for the club over twenty years ago . Alan Hutton attempts to challenge Jonathan Walters down the wing during the first half as the Stoke man puts a cross in . Asmir Begovic can only watch as Sinclair's header flies into the net to put Villa in front while the forward wheels away to celebrate . Sinclair scored his second goal in two games after settling last week's FA Cup tie with Leicester City with Sherwood in the stands . Sherwood and his bench jump up to celebrate Sinclair's strike with goals having been hard to come by recently for Villa . ‘I’m delighted,’ said Mark Hughes. ‘A lot of people were saying we would get beaten today because we wouldn’t be able to deal with the reaction to Tim’s arrival. We stood up to that and didn’t allow Villa to get any real momentum.’ Sherwood must pick himself and his players up quickly, with this loss sending Villa down to 19th below Burnley. ‘We have to put this behind us and not dwell,’ Sherwood said. ‘I can be devastated now but I won’t be devastated on Monday. Games come thick and fast.’ There are just 12 left for Sherwood to avert the disaster of a drop to the Championship. It had begun brightly, even after an early struggle for lift-off amid a freak hailstone blitz. Scott Sinclair provided the first goal of the Sherwood era, his header worthy of the No 9 on his back. In the 20th minute Carles Gil hit a corner that drifted all the way to Fabian Delph on the left flank, with Sinclair falling to the floor in a tangle with Phil Bardsley. He got to his feet quickly and arrived onto Delph’s cross to glance the ball in off the far post. He celebrated arms wide, his first Premier League strike since August 2012. It was also the first Villa goal in an opening period since December 20. But Stoke found a foothold and began to push back, grabbing an equaliser on the stroke of half-time. Stephen Ireland took a throw to Jonathan Walters, who held off substitute Aly Cissokho and played the ball back. Ireland whipped over a cross and Mame Biram Diouf found space between Vlaar and Alan Hutton to nod in. Sherwood took charge of his first game at Villa Park and was delighted with Sinclair's opener that put the home side in front . Ciaran Clark, Delph, Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor (L-R) all rush in to congratulate Sinclair (centre) while a Stoke defender lies injured . Diouf leaps between Ron Vlaar (left, challenging) and Hutton (right, challenging) to smash a header past Brad Guzan . Diouf is mobbed by his team-mates after equalising while Villa captain Vlaar trudges back up as the home side prepare to restart play . Christian Benteke jinks to get away from his marker Glenn Whelan as the out-of-sorts striker looked to put Villa back in front . Sherwood, as ever an animated figure on the touchline, reacts to a missed chance for his side with the scores level at 1-1 . Diouf tries to get ahead of Vlaar inside the penalty area as the powerful forward causes problems for the Villa defence in the second half . The second half was a low-key affair, punctuated by frequent injuries. Referee East was among those hurt, prompting much mirth. Jon Walters held up an imaginary substitute board. ‘You’re not fit to referee,’ was sung by the Holte End. Sherwood used the delay to hold a team talk, but there was little improvement from his team. Ciaran Clark’s header drew a finger-tip save from Begovic in the final minute, but it was Stoke who struck instead. If he did not know before, Sherwood must now realise the scale of his task. Roger East needed to add on more time at the end of the match because of a stoppage caused by an injury he suffered . East needed treatment from Aston Villa's medical staff as the Holte End sang: 'You're not fit to referee' to the injured official . Vlaar gave away a late penalty to allow Stoke the chance to win the game and he held his head on the floor in despair as he was sent off . Moses sends Guzan the wrong way with his late penalty while Villa fans behind the goal attempt in vain to put him off .

"Lionel Messi, Javier Mascherano and Neymar arrived in Granada on Friday looking they had taken part in a special three-for-two clothing offer. The Barcelona trio touched down ahead of their match with Granada on Saturday donning matching double denim outfits. They may look like are about to perform some of their greatest hits to an area full of screaming girls, but the attire is actually part of a sponsorship deal with denim company Replay. Neymar, Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano arrive in Grenada ahead of Saturday's La Liga match . Meanwhile coach Luis Enrique has given strong public backing to fullback Dani Alves, suggesting he wants the Brazil international to remain at the club beyond the end of this season. Alves is yet to agree an extension to his contract, which expires in June, raising the possibility the 31-year-old will leave the club he joined from La Liga rivals Sevilla in July 2008. Alves came under fire this week for reacting angrily when he was substituted in the second half of Tuesday's Champions League victory at Manchester City but Luis Enrique had nothing but praise for him on Friday. Neymar and Dani Alves participate in their team's training session at Joan Gamper sports city in Barcelona . 'In the decisions with the lineups you can see the confidence I have in Dani Alves, a player of great quality and professionalism,' Luis Enrique told a news conference ahead of Saturday's La Liga game at Granada. 'Dani Alves is one of the most upbeat lads we have in the dressing room: positive, optimistic and with a winner's character,' he added. 'Now that I know him better he is an example of what a professional should be. 'He is not the first player to be sad or angry when they leave the pitch. Some show it in a more effusive manner and others less so.' Barca coach Luis Erique says Dani Alves is one of the most upbeat lads he has in the dressing room . Argentinian striker Messi takes part in training ahead of Barcelona's game with Grenada . Alves has been a key part of Barca's success in recent years with his probing runs up the right wing and a fine understanding with the likes of Argentina forward Lionel Messi. However, he has sometimes attracted criticism for a perceived weakness in defence and it was his howler that led to Malaga's goal in last weekend's surprise 1-0 La Liga defeat at the Nou Camp. If Alves and Barca fail to agree on a new deal it could leave the club without a top-class right back as they have been banned by FIFA from participating in the transfer window until January next year. Enrique has suggestd he wants Brazil international Alves to remain at the club beyond the end of this season . Messi, Mascherano, Xavi and Gerard Pique participate in training session at Joan Gamper sports city . Luis Enrique does not appear to have much confidence in Martin Montoya, who has only made seven appearances this season, and new signing Douglas has made just two starts. Barca are second in La Liga with 14 matches remaining, four behind leaders Real Madrid, who host Villarreal on Sunday. Champions Atletico Madrid are three points behind Barca in third ahead of Sunday's game at Sevilla.

Attendance: 41,014 . By Adam Shergold at Stamford Bridge . Two goals down against one of the most expensively-assembled squads in Europe, Bradford staged one of the biggest FA Cup giant-killings of all time, leaving Chelsea with a 4-2 win. Jon Stead, Filipe Morais, Andy Halliday and Mark Yeates – Bradford's goalscorers – will be granted permanent membership into FA Cup folklore. But every player played their part. All heroes. As for Jose Mourinho, his side's tilt at an historic quadruple is over. His ego, and those of his players, is battered. But that's a story for another day. This is Bradford's fairytale. Chelsea, who were understrength, were cruising; goals from Gary Cahill and Ramires but them on course for a routine win. But then that old FA Cup magic cast yet another spell; a spell that will leave Chelsea's players sleepless for the next few days. The home side caught a glimpse of what was to follow when Peter Cech produced a brilliant instinctive save to deny Andrew Davies' bullet header inside the opening 15 minutes. The save sparked the Blues, at least for time being, into action. First Loic Remy, playing as a right winger, and Oscar both went close before Gary Cahill broke the deadlock with the most nonchalant of finishes. In meeting Oscar's near post corner, the England star mustered a cheeky flick with the outside of his boot – reminiscent of Blues legend Gianfranco Zola's famous strike against Norwich in 2002- that flew past Ben Williams' near post to put the Blues ahead. And in the 38th minute the Blues notched their second; Ramires exchanging passes with Salah before cooly slotting past Williams. Game over, right? Wrong. As Chelsea failed to deal with Morais' corner, the ball fell to Billy Knott who found Stead on the edge of the box. The former Blackburn striker took a touch before firing an unstoppable left-footed rocket past Cech.

Ramires (second left) slots home through a crowd of players to score Chelsea's second goal of the game . Ramires hugs Mohammed Salah as he celebrates scoring the second goal for Chelsea . This wasn't in the script for Mourinho's side. The FA Cup writes its own scripts, though. Remy tried to restore the home side's two-goal advantage three minutes into the second period, but his half volley, following some excellent wing play from Salah, ballooned wide. But that didn't nullify the momentum Bradford had gathered following's Stead's strike late in the first half. Morais and Knott both fired wide whilst in good positions as the Bantams sensed an equaliser. That was enough for Mourinho to send for the cavalry; Willian coming on for Salah, while Cesc Fabregas replaced Jon Obi Mikel, who needed treatment to a head injury after a collision with Knott. Fabregas made an instant impact, locating Oscar with a brilliant flick only for the Brazil international to fire wide from a good position before watching Drogba head his well-flighted free-kick straight at Williams. And a minute later – the unthinkable happened. James Meredith's long throw was met by Andrew Davies, whose header found Knott who saw his shot parried by Cech. But the rebound rolled into the direction of Morais. It must have seemed like an eternity for Morais as he waited for the ball to drop to his feet at the back post. But it was worth the wait as he slotted home to send the visitor's into a frenzy. As if the feat of a League One side coming back from two-down against the Premier League leaders wasn't dramatic enough; the sub-plot to the equaliser is worth considering. Morais and Knott were both on Chelsea's books as youngsters. They'd dreamed of scoring or providing an assist at Stamford Bridge during those fledgling days.

Their dreams had come true, though, perhaps, not in the shirts they'd envisaged wearing. Mourinho responded by throwing on Eden Hazard – the change didn't make a blind bit of difference though, as Bradford made history. Latching on to Stead's lay-off, Halliday's career flashed in front of his eyes in the 82nd minute. This was it. A moment that defines careers. Creates heroes. Creates legend. And the midfielder didn't choke, quite the opposite in fact, cooly side-footing past Cech from the edge of the box. Wow. Wow. Wow. Madness erupted from the vocal travelling support and the Bantams bench. Bradford knew what was coming. The kitchen sink. Drogba headed wide, before Kurt Zouma fired over the bar from close range after Ramires' cut-back. And yet there was more drama, the fourth official signalling seven minutes of stoppage time – much to Parkinson's annoyance. He needn't have worried, though, as substitute Mark Yeates notched a fourth after Stead's pass to secure the most famous of wins. Mourinho had seen enough; approaching Parkinson before attempting to head down the tunnel early. The Bradford boss wasn't having any of it, refusing to shake his counterpart's hand until the final whistle. There were eventually hand shakes. Bradford was shaking on Saturday night, as well.

"A thrill seeker has been left in a critical condition in intensive care after a freak gust of wind slammed him into a sea wall as he was kitesurfing. Mark Warren, 45, broke both his legs and suffered two broken ribs after being picked up and launched into the solid concrete seawall at Chalkwell beach in Essex. Mr Warren was immediately airlifted to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, with life-threatening injuries after the horrific incident. The freak accident happened in Chalkwell Beach, after the strong gust of wind slammed the kitesurfer into a concrete wall . Doctors say he remains in a critical, but stable, condition and is due to have an operation to repair his heart valve in the next couple of days. The keen kitesurfer - who has more than eight years’ experience - is believed to have been caught out by a freak gust of wind during treacherous conditions on Wednesday afternoon. Concerned brother Ian, 47, from Billericay, Essex, said: 'He had never been injured before. 'This was just a freak gust of wind that caught him at the wrong moment. 'Mark has been kitesurfing for about eight years and he also loves playing golf and football. 'He is so full of life and looks so much younger than he is.' Kitesurfing expert Simon Mudd, who runs the nearby Essex Kitesurf School, said even experienced surfers can be caught out by freak gusts of wind. He said: 'This accident involved an experienced kitesurfer - it was a freak thing which just caught him out.'

Meanwhile police continue to search for a missing 52-year-old man who got into trouble in water off Southend yesterday - less than two miles down the coast from Chalkwell. A full blown search and rescue operation was launched at 11.30am yesterday after a member of the public spotted a man desperately clinging to a mooring buoy around 400 yards out to sea. Two RNLI lifeboats, Southend coastguard, a search and rescue helicopter from RAF Wattisham, in Suffolk, and a boat from the Essex Police marine unit joined the search operation. No one was found although Southend RNLI staff searching the beach nearby did find clothes and personal items relating to a 52-year-old man from London. An RNLI spokesman said: 'There was an extensive sea search to the west of the pier involving both of our lifeboats, the search and rescue helicopter, Southend Coastguard and police marine unit. 'We were looking for a male swimmer - possibly in trouble. 'A member of the public reported seeing a man clinging to a mooring buoy about 400 yards from the pier. 'We were stood down at around 1pm.'

"And to think this was not deemed attractive enough for television. What more do they want? The League One conquerors of Chelsea versus another terrified top-flight opponent, old boys rejected by Sunderland with a score to settle, a deafening capacity crowd and a pitch which even cattle would turn their noses up at. And boy, did it deliver — a beautifully ugly contest, blood, studs and thunder from the off. Goalscorer Jon Stead is mobbed by his team-mates James Hanson and Billy Clarke after scoring Bradford's second goal at Valley Parade .

Managers Phil Parkinson and Gus Poyet agreed on two things — Bradford’s victory was deserved and the ferocity of the tie was from a bygone era. But there was romance, too. For ex-Black Cat Jon Stead, scorer of the game-clinching second, was once mocked by Sunderland fans who printed T-shirts reading ‘I saw Jon Stead score a goal’ after it took the striker 30 games to find the back of the net in their colours. He had the last laugh on Sunday, however, and is now the only player to have scored in all five rounds of this year’s competition. As Stead made way in the final minute, the joyous Valley Parade crowd rose as one, affording their man of the match a spine-tingling ovation. In stark contrast, Sunderland’s supporters were fighting among themselves, thus displaying more spirit than their side had shown on the pitch. For Poyet’s side were awful, beaten from the third minute when Billy Clarke’s shot was deflected in off John O’Shea. At full time, the away fans booed their own players before hissing ‘Gustavo Poyet, it’s always our fault’ in response to the head coach blaming them for recent performances. But that poison could not detract from the passion of the brilliant Bantams. League Cup finalists two seasons ago, their list of Premier League victims also includes Arsenal and Aston Villa. They are now one match from a third Wembley appearance in two years, and on the evidence of this pulsating performance which married craft and graft on a bog of a pitch, few will fancy a trip to West Yorkshire in the quarter-finals, reticent television companies apart. Bradford outfought and outthought the Wearsiders to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in 39 years. The pitch, in the end, was a leveller, and at times Bradford did drop to the level of Sunderland. In a forewarning of Sunderland’s anaemic display, Argentinian playmaker Ricky Alvarez appeared scared of the ball as it dropped inside the first minute, ducking out of a free header.

Rory McArdle strikes a pose at the end of Bradford's latest giant-killing act as the Bantams booked their place in the last eight . He wasn’t the only player in blue guilty of freezing during a frenzied start and Bradford’s opening goal came as no surprise. Filipe Morais delivered a free-kick from the right and, when the visitors failed to clear, Clarke took advantage to blast home off O’Shea at the far post. Not content with rattling their guests with that goal, brutish and bearded centre back Rory McArdle thundered through the back of Danny Graham when competing for a high ball and the pair only returned to the action some minutes later, bloodied and bandaged. Further evidence of Sunderland’s lacklustre approach came when Steven Fletcher, refusing to retreat from a free-kick, was booked after his limp leg blocked the attempt to restart. Bradford were threatening a second and it would have been well deserved had Stead’s header from James Meredith’s centre bounced inside the post rather than creeping wide. But Sunderland should have been level on 18 minutes. Seb Larsson’s shot found its way to the unmarked Fletcher, onside just six yards from goal. One touch to steady himself was understandable but the indecision which followed was unforgivable, allowing McArdle to slide and hook clear. Replays suggested the defender had fouled Fletcher, but by putting the ball in the net when he had the chance all debate would have been avoided. Sunderland finished the half in more positive fashion. Larsson saw a snap volley deflected over the bar by a sliding Gary Liddle, Graham headed into the arms of Ben Williams from Adam Johnson’s lofted centre and the keeper then improvised to keep out a Patrick van Aanholt drive with his knees. But Johnson’s most telling contribution came at the other end as, from his woeful attempt at a clearance, James Hanson returned a header for Stead to score on 62 minutes. The 31-year-old stepped inside O’Shea before firing under the weak grasp of Vito Mannone . Sunderland failed to fashion a chance of note thereafter and the sight of fans scuffling with each other should worry Poyet, whose position could come under scrutiny this week.

"Genghis Khan, pictured in this 1780 portrait by Pierre Duflos, expanded the Mongol Empire in the 13th century - a time of unusual wet and warm weather . Scroll down for video . He was one of the most feared warriors in history, waging bloody war across Asia and Europe. But Genghis Khan’s 13th-century rampage may have never happened had it not been for a spell of good weather. The leader of the Mongol armies created a vast empire that eventually stretched across China, India, Russia and Eastern Europe. Historians used to think his armies of nomadic horsemen were fleeing the bleak, cold and dry Mongolian plains for warmer regions. But now scientists have discovered that the rise of the Mongol Empire coincided with a 14-year spell of weather that was the warmest and wettest for 1,000 years. The academics, from Columbia University in New York, discovered the weather anomaly by studying the rings of ancient trees. They think the conditions created those needed for a boost in lush growth of grass, which would have fuelled the soldiers' horses and fattened their livestock. The good weather lasted from 1211 to 1225 - the exact period when Genghis Khan and his armies rose to prominence. Amy Hessl, co-author of the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said: ‘The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events. ‘It wasn’t the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power. ‘Where it’s arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower. Genghis was literally able to ride that wave.’ Researchers analysed 17 trees found in the Khangai Mountains in Mongolia, marked at A, to chart a yearly record of rainfall back to 658 AD. They claim that due to the warm and wet weather during Genghis' reign, there would have been an unusual increase in grass production, which would have fuelled a boom in livestock . Statue of Genghis Khan in the Tov Province, Mongolia. Originally known as Temujin of the Borjigin, legend has it Genghis was born holding a clot of blood in his hand. His father was Khan, or emperor, of a small tribe but was murdered when Temujin was still young. Genghis conquered almost four times the lands of Alexander the Great . Before Khan rose to power the Mongol tribes had been racked by disarray and internal warfare. In the early 1200s he united the tribes, creating a military state that invaded its neighbours and expanded, soon ruling most of what would become modern Korea, China, Russia, eastern Europe, southeast Asia, Persia and India. Khan made himself master of half the known world, and inspired mankind with a fear that lasted for generations. He was a prolific lover, fathering hundreds of children across his territories. Some scientists think he has 16 million male descendants alive today. Genghis Khan was the founder and Great Khan of the Mongol Empire.

By the time he died in August 1227, the Mongol Empire covered a vast part of Central Asia and China. Originally known as Temüjin of the Borjigin, legend has it Genghis was born holding a clot of blood in his hand. His father was Khan, or emperor, of a small tribe but was murdered when Temüjin was still young. The new tribal leader wanted nothing to do with Temujin's family, so with his mother and five other children, Temüjin was cast out and left to die. In all, Genghis conquered almost four times the lands of Alexander the Great. He is still revered in Mongolia and in parts of China. The empire eventually fragmented, but the Mongols’ vast geographic reach and their inventions survived. Their ideas included an international postal system, organized agriculture research and a civil service based on merit. Neil Pederson, who co-wrote the paper, said: ‘Before fossil fuels, grass and ingenuity were the fuels for the Mongols and the cultures around them. ‘Energy flows from the bottom of an ecosystem, up the ladder to human society. Genghis Khan was the founder and Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, pictured. After he united nomadic tribes in Asia he founded the Mongol Empire and began invading the rest of the continent of Eurasia. By the time he died in August 1227, the Mongol Empire covered a vast part of Central Asia and China . ‘Even today, many people in Mongolia live just like their ancestors did.’ The researchers said the trees, some of them more than 1,000 years old, gave them an indication of what the future could hold for the region, with drought and other extreme weather likely to become more common in central Asia. ‘This last big drought is an example of what may happen in the future, not just in Mongolia but in a lot of inner Asia,’ said Mr Pederson. ‘The heat is a double whammy - even if rainfall doesn't change, the landscape is going to get drier.’ Other historical events that studies say were affected by climate include the disappearance of the Maya, the expansion and fall of Roman imperial power and the 13th-century collapse of south east Asia's Angkor civilisation.","Researchers from West Virginia analysed trees in the Khangai Mountains .

"When men of a certain age do it, they risk looking slightly ridiculous. But it seems a high-five has at least one advantage – experts say it is better for health than a handshake. A British study has found that slapping palms together at head height passes on fewer than half as many germs as the traditional greeting. Awkward: David Cameron (left) and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker attempt a high-five . This might be some consolation for David Cameron, who was accused of displaying a lack of dignity earlier this month after using the ‘street’ gesture when meeting European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The high-five was said to defuse tension at the meeting, the first since the Prime Minister failed to block the former Luxembourg leader from taking the EU’s most powerful post. However, it was made clear Mr Juncker initiated the unorthodox greeting. For the study, two Aberystwyth University researchers donned thick rubber gloves and one dipped his hand in a bacterial soup before shaking the other’s hand. 'Fistbump': A British study has found that high-fives pass on fewer than half as many germs as the traditional greeting. And the fistbump (displayed by US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle) is even cleaner . Trendy greeting: The Obamas' husband-wife fistbump was caught on camera at an election night rally in 2008 . The number of bugs transmitted to the second glove was counted and the contact area measured. Then the procedure was repeated with high-fives and also with the even trendier fistbump, which involves two balled fists being gently and briefly rapped together. The high-five was more hygienic than the handshake but the fistbump was the cleanest of all, transferring around one-twentieth of the bugs of the handshake. It is thought that the brevity of the action and the smaller contact area helped slash transmission. Fans of the fistbump include US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle. Smaller contact area: Obama and Cameron high-five as they play table tennis with London students in 2011 . Speaking after a husband-wife fistbump was caught on camera in 2008, she said: ‘I’m not that hip. I got this from the young staff – it’s the new high-five.’ Aberystwyth University researcher Dave Whitworth recommended that doctors and other hospital staff avoid handshakes with patients. For those for whom only a handshake conveys the correct level of respect, tips include keeping it brief and weak. As for the etiquette of it all, Dr Whitworth said: ‘That is something everyone would have to improvise with. There will be some people who are quite happy fist-bumping all the time and there will be some who will look on aghast.’","High-five is better for person's health than handshake, says British study .

"Nasa is rushing to resolve a spacesuit problem that put the life of an astronaut in danger in 2013 ahead of three important spacewalks. Two astronauts onboard the ISS will venture outside the station in the suits in the coming days. But while the suits appear to be in working order, engineers are concerned about a recurring issue that led to the helmet flooding previously while an astronaut was in space. US space agency Nasa is rushing to fix a spacesuit problem. It is related to a problem in 2013 that nearly drowned an astronaut. The issue is where the fan pump separator, party of the spacesuit's temperature control system. If the pump failed, the astronauts would have to return to the ISS (shown) The issue is with a piece of equipment known as the fan pump separator, part of the spacesuit's temperature control system. 'That is the same area of concern we had back in 2013 when we had the issue of the water in the helmet,' said Kenneth Todd, ISS Operations and Integration manager. The trio of upcoming spacewalks will install new docking stations for commercial cargo at the orbiting laboratory. Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. Nasa was alerted to the problem when astronauts were doing spacesuit maintenance in December and found that the fan pump in one suit did not speed up as expected. A new fan pump separator that was on board the space station was installed as a replacement 'and it has been working with no issues since that point,' said Mr Todd. However, when Nasa commander Barry Wilmore was scrubbing cooling loops on another US spacesuit on January 20, he heard an 'abnormally loud fan pump separator,' according to Nasa's blog of space station activities. 'We were doing the same kind of activity and encountered the same type of failure,' Mr Todd told reporters. 'That got us thinking: what has changed? What is happening?' A new spacesuit was shipped to the outpost and will be worn by Mr Wilmore during the spacewalks. The other spacesuit, with the replacement part, will be worn by fellow astronaut Terry Virts. Its fan pump separator has shown some signs of corrosion, but it is working, Todd said. 'The two suits we are going out with have operated every time we turned them on,' he said. Engineers believe that small amounts of water are building up in the bearings inside the fan pump separator each time the suit is powered up and powered down, leading to corrosion over time. The upcoming spacewalks will be performed by Nasa astronauts Barry Wilmore (left) and Terry Virts (right). The spacewalks are scheduled for 20 February, 24 February and 1 March, each beginning at around 12.10pm GMT (7.10am EST) and lasting about six hours . The issue is related to the water-in-helmet leak that nearly drowned Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano during a spacewalk in July 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water, Mr Todd said. 'With the water in the helmet, that was a totally different root cause issue. That was an issue with port holes getting clogged up in the water separator, that was due to the water chemistry,' he explained. 'That is not an issue here. What we are talking about is a failure of the pump to start up. That in itself is not a water-type of event.' If the pump were to fail, the astronauts would have to end their spacewalk and return to the hatch. 'This is not a risk to the crew in terms of loss of life,' said Todd. The issue is related to the water-in-helmet leak that nearly drowned Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano during a spacewalk in July 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered (shown here in this image from the ISS) - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water . A final decision about whether or not the spacewalks - known as extra-vehicular activities, or EVAs - can begin Friday as planned depends on the outcome of further tests, and should be announced later today. 'All indicators are - based on all the data from the ground testing as well as the testing of the suits on orbit - is that we will work our way through this and these suits are going to be okay. But we have some open work left to do,' said Mr Todd. The spacewalks are scheduled for 20 February, 24 February and 1 March, each beginning at around 12.10pm GMT (7.10am EST) and lasting about six hours. The astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station. The ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017. Boeing and SpaceX are in the process of completing their respective crew vehicles, which will restore the United States' ability to send astronauts to low-Earth orbit after the retirement of the space shuttle program in 2011.","US space agency Nasa is rushing to fix a spacesuit problem .

Kadmiri's lawyer said the man had drug and mental health issues before the March 18 incident, but two doctors have found him fit to stand trial. The competency hearing was called after Kadmiri appeared in court on September 2, and labelled the prosecutors Beavis and Butthead. Kadmiri claimed his former lawyer had worked to convict him and then announced, 'I'm really paranoid'. The 25-year-old is accused of firing a Dirty Harry-style Magnum revolver at Fardel and the Thunder From Down Under troupe while they were at the Excalibur Casino on the Vegas strip, in the middle of their show. Scroll down for video . Joey Kadmiri appears in Las Vegas District Court on Tuesday, July 8, 2014. Las Vegas resident Kadmiri is accused of sneaking into the dressing room of Australian, Las Vegas-based stripper troupe Thunder from Down Under, stealing their costumes and then firing a gun when he was apprehended. Australian Thunder from Down Under stripper, Mathew Fardell, told a Las Vegas court how he tried to pin down the hand of a man threatening to fire a handgun inside their dressing room at the Excalibur casino in Las Vegas . Fardell said he came off stage at their show at the Excalibur Casino on March 18 and was told an intruder was being held by other members of his troupe. He went out to a patio and saw his fellow strippers Aidan Te Puke and Ryan Paki struggling to control Kadmiri so he decided to subdue him by 'choking him out'. The struggle continued with more strippers coming to help, before Kadmiri fell back on to the floor with the strippers on top of him. Fardell said he noticed Kadmiri was wearing  the blue Calvin Klein underpants Mr Te Puke wears in the show under his jeans. He also noticed under the underpants Kadmiri was wearing one of his tight, black G-strings. Las Vegas authorities allege Kadmiri was high on a drug, methamphetamine, when he snuck backstage of the Thunder Showroom in the Excalibur Casino on March 18, rifled through the troupe's belongings, and stole G-strings, underpants and other props from their show. 'He (Kadmiri) yelled, “I've got a gun. I'm going to shoot now”,' Mr Fardell told the court on Tuesday. Mr Fardell didn't believe him after seeing the underpants and G-string. 'I kind of relaxed because, given he was wearing my thong and he had on Aidan's underwear, I thought, ""I don't think he'd have a gun"",' he said. Australian Thunder from Down Under stripper, Mathew Fardell, told a Las Vegas court how he tried to pin down the hand of a man threatening to fire a handgun inside their dressing room at the Excalibur casino in Las Vegas . He initially thought Kadmiri was talking about one of the fake guns the troupe uses in SWAT and gangster acts in their show. 'I turned and in his hand was the biggest gun you have ever seen in your life,' he said. 'I don't know guns that well, but I knew it was .44 Magnum. It was massive.' The performer said he put all of his might on Kadmiri's wrist to make sure the gun was pointing away from them before Kadmiri pulled the trigger, lodging the bullet in the wall of an Italian restaurant at the casino. Fardell was so close to the gun when it went off he suffered gunpowder burns on his face and in his left eye, and also suffered tinnitus in his left ear. The ear was bleeding, but after security and police took Kadmiri into custody, Fardell and his troupe went back on stage to finish the show. 'I could feel blood dripping on my shirt,' Mr said. Kadmiri is alleged to have snuck into the Thunder Down Under dressing room on March 18 by claiming to be a new performer in the show . 'It's a miracle that no one was killed,' Prosecutor Kenneth Portz said in his opening address. 'These men don't miss the gym all that much, and it still took six men to hold him.' The .44 calibre Magnum revolver was a gun made famous by Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies, Mr Portz told the court. Prosecutors on Monday dropped eight of 17 charges originally filed by a grand jury in the case, including attempted murder, armed robbery and several counts of robbery with a weapon. The accused suffered a black eye and other minor injuries during the scuffle that saw him allegedly fire a gun . Kadmiri plead not guilty and his lawyers, Joshua Tomsheck and Roy Nelson, plan to make their opening arguments later this week. Police later found that Kadmiri had with him a pair of surgical gloves, an open 2.1-gram plastic packet of methamphetamine and a box of bullets for the handgun. His lawyers haven't confirmed if Kadmiri will testify. A trial date is expected to be set at a hearing on October 3. Kadmiri is being held in a Vegas detention centre on $US500,000 bail.

"Humans through the ages have wondered what it is like to be a bird but now hi-tech headwear has revealed the complex hunting strategies of falcons. U.S. scientists got a bird’s eye view of falcons’ attack strategies by fixing helmets containing tiny cameras to the heads of the birds, which also wore backpacks to record footage of their predatory flights. They discovered that falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary, which allows them to make their attack with precision. Scroll down for video . The scientists worked with 13 falconers in Europe and the U.S. to capture footage of aerial attacks from the birds' point of view  (pictured chasing a crow) and painstakingly logged the position of the birds in each frame of video to reconstruct their attack techniques . Adult falcons have thin tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and to change direction rapidly. Falcons intercept their prey in mid-air after following it at a distance. They keep their target in the centre of their field of vision. To conserve energy, falcons . readjust their flight position so that their prey appears to be . motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape, . This helps them . predict the future position of their victim. Falcons are able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tail it in a straightforward way. Bats and dragonflies use a similar hunting technique. Researchers from Haverford College, Pennsylvania explained that the hunting technique allows the birds to intercept their prey in mid-air, without having to follow it closely - giving the predators the element of surprise. The scientists worked with 13 falconers in Europe and the U.S. to capture footage of aerial attacks from the birds’ point of view and painstakingly logged the position of the falcons in each frame of video to reconstruct their attack techniques. By comparing the position of the targets in the falcons' visual field, they were able to map the bird’s flight path. Researchers from Haverford College, Pennsylvania explained that the hunting technique allows falcons (pictured) to intercept their prey in mid-air, without having to follow it closely - giving the predators the element of surprise . This revealed that if the prey appeared at the centre of the falcon’s field of view, the falcon was probably intending to attack it from a distance and was keeping an eye its target's every move. However, the birds also used more complicated strategies. Suzanne Kane, from the university, told Live Science, said: ‘This strategy of heading straight toward the prey at all times is easy to implement, but it involves following a very winding pathway and it turns out to be a very inefficient way of catching prey.’ To boost efficiency, the predatory birds readjusted their flight position so that their prey appeared to be motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape, which helped the falcons predict the future position of their victim and conserve energy. The falcons were able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tailed it, Professor Kane said. During pursuit, the falcons appeared to . head off their prey using a strategy called motion camouflage, meaning . they intercept the prey in the least amount of time while also masking . its approach. The scientists discovered that falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary, which allows them to make a targeted attack. Here, the landscape is blurred, but the falcon has zeroed in on its target - the crow (pictured centre) Researchers from Haverford College, Pennsylvania (pictured with Professor Suzanne Kane, author of the study, centre) explained that the hunting technique allows the birds to intercept their prey in mid-air, without having to follow it closely, to give it the predators the element of surprise . Previous studies have shown that bats and dragonflies use the same technique. Professor Kane explained that the falconers made special hoods so that the cameras were fixed tightly to the birds’ heads, but did not impede their view. ‘We had some birds who didn't want to wear them, but overall most were unconcerned with the cameras and tolerated the equipment just fine,’ she said. The research, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, was based upon data from eight different falcons making flights in the U.S. Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK. The scientists now aim on investigating other aspects of falcon hunting behaviour, including how the birds select their victims from a flock. Professor Kane said: ‘Falcons are magnificent, charismatic animals and the falcon’s-eye videos of their hunts are very exciting. ‘I can still say that, even though I have spent hours studying them frame by frame using image analysis software. ‘This is truly nature red in tooth and claw. There is something really primal and moving about watching that elemental struggle between predator and prey.’ U.S. scientists got a bird's eye view of falcons' attack strategies by fixing helmets containing tiny cameras to the heads of the birds, which also wore backpacks to record footage of their predatory flights.

"There are grave suspicions within UEFA that the Michael Garcia report into World Cup bid corruption will be altered by FIFA lawyers before it is published to protect president Sepp Blatter. This follows German magazine Der Spiegel’s revelations that criticisms of Blatter contained in FIFA governance committee chairman Mark Pieth’s reform report last year were removed by Zurich’s legal advisor Marco Villiger. UEFA chief Michel Platini has damned the blatant interference by FIFA. UEFA have concerns that FIFA lawyers will alter Michael Garcia's report into the World Cup bid corruption . His spokesman said: ‘This shows FIFA’s independent governance committee was anything but independent. UEFA has always wondered why it was criticised by Mr Pieth and wrongly accused of blocking FIFA reforms. Now we understand why.’ It’s also been suggested American lawyer Garcia’s shock resignation from his FIFA investigative role in protest at Hans-Joachim Eckert’s summary of his findings might be more to do with his Blatter observations being ‘amended’ than detail involving Russia or Qatar. Michel Platini is unhappy with the deemed blatant interference by FIFA in this case . FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali of Jordan said: ‘Something is not right at the heart of FIFA governance. Without publishing the Garcia report in full, FIFA faces ongoing public suspicion that interference may have occurred.’ FIFA, who called the Pieth report legal marks ‘standard procedure’, claim only five changes were made and say: ‘There can be no question of FIFA exerting unfair influence.’ Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner  continues to send mixed messages out of Villa Park as to whether he wants to sell the Premier League club. But certainly Lerner prefers to sped this time of year holidaying at the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados rather than watching his team in action. Randy Lerner (right), pictured with former Aston Villa chairman Doug Ellis (left), is sending mixed signals over whether or not he wants out of the Midlands club . Channel 4, having flirted with the idea of having racing fan Jeremy Kyle present their flagship Grand National coverage on April 11 to appeal to a wider audience, are understood to be reverting to their normal racing anchor Nick Luck in the absence of Clare Balding, who has opted to cover the Boat Race for BBC. Jeremy Kyle, pictured with wife Carla at Cheltenham and Ascot respectively, is a big racing fan . lt hasn’t helped the turmoil at Leicester City that Jon Rudkin, director of football and friend of the Thai owners, has no relationship with manager Nigel Pearson, who is believed to have been sacked and then re-instated on Sunday. Rudkin has been in his role since before Christmas when he replaced Terry Robinson. Before that, he was Leicester’s academy director and he has kept out of Pearson’s way following a previous falling-out. Nigel Pearson is not on good terms with Leicester's director of football Jon Rudkin . BT make their move . The £4billion Premier League TV rights tender goes into a second round on Tuesday morning with revised bids due by midday. The seven packages are expected to be awarded later in the day. Although the Discovery Channel and beIN Sport have shown interest, the most likely scenario is that Sky will retain four prime packages while BT get an increased number of games, up to 56 out of the 168 live matches being sold per season for three years. Overall, the likely cost will be around £8m per game. However, Sky retaining the 4pm Sunday slot package, which has the most first picks attached to it, will allow them to dominate the choice of games as they have done since the start of the Barclays Premier League. The FA, whose relationship with FIFA can hardly get worse, are further exasperated by Zurich not only dumping the regulation of agents back on national associations but also banning third-party ownership across world football but not giving proper guidance as to how this will work. This follows the FIFA ExCo banning emergency loans between clubs despite the FIFA executive and Players Status Committee supporting the system — as well as the whole of English football. England’s Ashes-winning women’s cricket team have posed in contemporary ball gowns for a magazine photoshoot in the Lord’s Long Room for sponsors Waitrose. The original idea was for them to wear Downton Abbey style dresses. Not a good move after the ‘Downton Shabby’ Twitter attack launched on England cricket chief Paul Downton by Kevin Pietersen’s cheerleader, Piers Morgan.","UEFA have growing suspicions that FIFA lawyers will alter the Michael Garcia report to protect president Sepp Blatter .

"My wife and I have been to Nice every summer for the last five years. Why? Because it’s like being on a cruis. Everything is right on your doorstep, especially the sparkling sea. Anyone who climbs to the park on a hill called the Colline du Chateau, at the east end of town, will see what I mean. From here you can watch the planes - far enough out to sea to be inaudible - as they approach the airport at the west tip of the bay on which Nice stands. Not exactly like Blackpool: Nice has long been a seafront favourite with British travellers . Arriving passengers can board a bus that leaves from outside the terminal and skirts the sea for 20 minutes, then you’re in the middle of the bay, where most of the hotels are located. This is the Promenade des Anglais, named after the Britons who launched Nice as a holiday resort - albeit a winter one - 200 years ago. You still hear a lot of English voices, and the Niçoise French are not as intimidatingly chic as the Parisians: they tend to be overripe ladies with small fluffy dogs in tow. They get through a lot of the staple Niçoise drink - rosé - while basking at the seafront cafes. The city, with its sparkling sea and hinterland of slumberous villas, is more beautiful than any British resort, but it is bracingly reminiscent of some of the more rackety ones. The stony beach - the penance you pay for entering the turquoise sea - reminds me of Brighton. The palm trees along the centre of the prom are fairy-lit at night, like a more tasteful Blackpool. The manager of the most select hotel, Le Negresco, would be appalled to learn that its Belle Époque architecture reminds me of the Grand Hotel, Scarborough. The Grand is no longer grand but Le Negresco keeps its end up: a glass of wine in its stately bar costs around £25. So we don’t stay there, but at the Hyatt Regency Palais de la Méditerranée, a couple of blocks along. The original Palais, built in 1930, was a general house of fun, with a restaurant, casino and theatre. By the year 2000, it had fallen into decay and was rebuilt as a hotel, although the lovely art-deco façade is preserved. The Palais is not extortionate - no tip-hungry porter is thrust upon you at check-in - but it is still glamorous, like Nice itself. With all due respect to Blackpool and Scarborough, you wouldn’t catch Bono, Elton John, Sean Connery or Bill Gates living there, as they do in Nice. The city stars in many films featuring beautiful people involved in shady business, including The Jewel Of The Nile (Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas), Ronin (Robert de Niro and Natascha McElhone) and The Day Of The Jackal (the jackal, played by Edward Fox, naturally stays at Le Negresco). But Nice is one of the less expensive jewels on the Côte d’Azur. Big screen: Films such as The Day Of The Jackal (left) and The Jewel Of The Nile have used Nice as a backdrop . It does not exist solely to exploit tourists. The streets inland of the front are full of the French being French: smoking in café terraces; discussing their ailments in the numerous pharmacies. When my wife Lisa and I ask the way to the Museum of Modern Art, nobody knows. Perhaps it is the profusion of museums and galleries that causes the confusion. Nice has more than any French city except Paris. Many are run by the municipality, and these are free. We like the ones close to the prom - partly, I admit, because we can’t be bothered to walk far in the heat. The Musée Masséna, a blessedly cool 19th-century mansion featuring many paintings of old Nice, is right on the prom, at No. 35. Five minutes inland, at 33  Avenue des Baumettes, is the Musée des Beaux-Arts, formerly the residence of a Ukranian princess. It is full of paintings even I can appreciate (thank goodness for Post-Impressionism). There never seems to be more than half a dozen visitors, so I pad around the elegant rooms pretending it’s my house. At the westward base of the Colline is the Old Town, with its medieval alleyways, baroque churches and the most interesting shops, including Maison Auer, at 7 rue Saint-Francoise de Paule, which is unchanged since 1820, and sells glacé fruits. Lisa likes the antique/bric-a-brac market held in the main square of the Old Town, the Cours Saleya, every Monday. My role is to follow her about carrying the linen napkins she buys in bulk. The square is lined with restaurants serving good Italian and Niçoise food. Our favourite is La Favola, where you dine on a terrace under Art Nouveau street lamps. Seafood and pasta are the specialities, and everything is on a huge scale. Plates are 2ft across; the olive oil comes in a sort of petrol can. At night, the green hill of the Colline - atmospherically illuminated - soars above the old town like a vision of heaven. Immediately east of the hill lies the small harbour, where the yachts of the billionaires look somehow less brash than those in Monaco, 12 miles along the coast. I always visit Monaco when in Nice, mainly for the scenic train ride, which costs around £6 for a return ticket. In Monaco, an entry-level property costs £5 million, whereas in Nice, you can buy a two-bedroom flat with sea view for a twentieth of that - my retirement dream. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies from London to Nice from £68 return. Double . rooms at the Hyatt Regency Palais de la Méditerranée (0033 04 9327 . 1234, nice.regency.hyatt.com) cost from £150 (room only).","Nice, a jewel of the Cote d'Azur, has long been popular with British tourists .

"Wilfried Bony has been truly outstanding for Swansea City and Manchester City will know they are getting a top-quality player. His £30million move to the Etihad looks like it will be completed soon. City are getting a brilliant striker to add to their already top-notch resources. Here, Martin Keown assesses Bony's strengths... Manchester City look set to sign Wilfried Bony after opening talks with Swansea City over a £30million deal . Bony fires in a goal against Queens Park Rangers for Swansea at Loftus Road on New Year's Day . Bony was pictured at the airport on Wednesday as he headed for the Africa Cup of Nations . He was pictured with his agent (right) as he prepared to head out and represent the Ivory Coast . The perfect blend of power and pace . When Bony is on the move, defenders simply bounce off him. He is so powerful and direct that he just swats opponents aside. He embarrasses defenders because they can’t lay a glove on him. But there is great touch and skill to go with that immense strength. He is good on the ball and his ability to launch off his left or right foot is similar to Sergio Aguero. He explodes past players in the same way. Bony is so good at shifting his bodyweight and that makes it hard for defenders to read him and deal with him - once he’s past you, there is no catching him. He also likes to stay central and as high up the pitch as he can so that when he runs off the shoulder of a defender, he can minimise the number of touches he needs before he can get a shot in. And when he does get a shot away, he has fantastic composure in front of goal. A man who loves to use his head . At six foot, Bony is no slouch, but he loves competing in the air. For somebody who’s so good on the ball, that is quite unusual. He really enjoys getting on the end of crosses and has said in the past he only needs one from his team-mates to score. He hasn’t scored a header so far this season but he might fare better at City. Bony plays in a similar way to Sergio Aguero - he can be a great replacement or a brilliant partner . The Ivorian forward loves to use his head as well, demonstrated against QPR on New Year's Day . Swansea’s crossing accuracy in 2014-15 is the second worst in the league, whereas City's is the fourth best. If they can feed Bony regularly then he is bound to keep scoring. He’s quite similar to Radamel Falcao when it comes to heading - neither are huge but they beat opponents to the ball out of sheer desire. He wants to be first to it every time and uses his power well to make sure he is. Bony celebrates after scoring for Swansea against QPR during the 1-1 draw at Loftus Road on New Year's Day . Not just a selfish striker . Bony's primary function is to score goals, but he is excellent at bringing others into the game. If he comes deep his first thought is to see which of his team-mates is in the most dangerous position and he will try to find them. He’s got quick, nimble feet, so he is able to pull off great bits of skill and he has a good awareness of how play is developing around him. He plays with real imagination and moving to City to play with the likes of Aguero and David Silva will only improve that. Bony and his  team-mates celebrate his goal at Anfield against Liverpool, who opted against signing the striker . He has interested a number of clubs having scored the most Premier League goals in the calendar year . Experience tells . Bony is 26 but City are getting a player at the peak of his powers. It is a dream move so credit to him for working hard for years in the Czech Republic and Holland to progress. That time has served him well but Swansea also deserve credit for giving him a chance to shine where others ignored him. The competition at City will be tough, but he has already seen what it’s like not to play in every game - he was rotated by Garry Monk over Christmas almost as preparation to see how Swansea would cope without him. Bony, pictured climbing above the Arsenal defence in March, says he always tries to be in the right place . The Ivorian scores past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart in November as Swansea lost 2-1 at the Etihad .","Wilfried Bony is close to moving to Manchester City for £30million .

"The CIA was operating a covert . mission in the U.S. consulate in Libya when it came under attack by al . Qaeda-linked militants on September 11, intelligent chiefs have . admitted. Four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, were . killed in the six-hour, commando-style attack on the US Mission in the . Libyan city, for which al-Qaeda and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia have been blamed. The CIA made the revelation as it laid bare the heroic rescue by a handful of its agents in which they fought off wave after wave of mortar and rocket attacks with just their handguns as they sought to infiltrate the compound and shepherd its American staff to safety. A timeline, released by the agency, has blown open the dramatic sequence of events, revealing for the first time that of the 30 American . officials evacuated from the country following the deadly attack, just seven worked . for the State Department. Burning issue: Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the consulate in Benghazi . The rest were part of a crack team of intelligence and security experts on a secret mission aimed at counterterrorism and securing heavy weapons held by the embattled regime. They had been operating out of a building known as 'the annex', around a mile away from the consulate in central Benghazi. Intelligence officials told how when the annex received a call about the assault, about a half dozen members of a CIA . security team tried to get heavy weapons and other assistance from the . Libyans. But with time running out, the team went ahead with the rescue attempt armed only with their standard-issue small arms. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died of smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle with insurgents . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . A fierce firefight ensued and the team managed to get into the consulate and shepherd its occupants back to the annex under constant attack from machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades. 'The security officers in particular were . genuine heroes,' an official said. 'They quickly tried to rally additional local support and . heavier weapons, and when that could not be accomplished within . minutes, they still moved in and put their own lives on the line to save . their comrades. 'At . every level in the chain of command, from the senior officers in Libya . to the most senior officials in Washington, everyone was fully engaged . in trying to provide whatever help they could.' The CIA revelations come after Barack Obama's administration came under sharp attack over its handling of the incident amid claims Washington told officers on the ground to 'stand down' before the rescue took place. Attack: A U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed in the terror strike that occurred on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 . 'There . was no second-guessing those decisions being made on the ground, by . people at every U.S. organization that could play a role in assisting . those in danger,' the official added. 'There were no orders to anybody to stand down in . providing support.' In the first days after the attack, various administration officials . linked the Benghazi incident to the simultaneous protests around the . Muslim world over an American-made film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet . Muhammad. Only later did they publicly attribute it to militants, . possibly linked to al-Qaeda, and acknowledged it was distinct from the . film protests. The changing explanations have led to suspicions that the . administration didn't want to acknowledge a terror attack on U.S. personnel so close to the Nov. 6 election, a charge Obama has strongly . denied. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . According to the timeline, around 9:40 p.m. Benghazi time, officials at the CIA's relatively fortified and well-defended base in Benghazi got a call from State Department officials at the U.S. diplomatic mission about a mile away that the less-fortified public mission complex had come under attack from a group of militants. Other official sources said that the initial wave of attacks on the diplomatic mission involved setting fires using diesel fuel. 9.40pm - CIA officials in 'The Annex' get a distress call from the consulate saying they are under attack. 10.05pm - Armed only with handguns, team of about six CIA security officers leave their base for the public diplomatic mission compound. 10.30pm - With bullets whistling overhead, the CIA team move into the compound after unsuccessfully trying to get heavy weapons and help from local Libyan allies. 11.10pm - A Defense Department drone, which had . been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to . help officials on the ground gather information. 11.30pm - U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission all accounted for, except for Ambassador Stevens. 11.40pm - Driving back to the secure base, the evacuees come under further fire. 12am - The installation itself comes under fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. 12am - A CIA security team . based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, lands at . Benghazi airport and begins plotting how to locate the missing ambassador. 1am - The patchy attacks on the base begin to die down after 90 minutes of fierce fighting. 4am - The . reinforcements from Tripoli take a convoy of . vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for evacuation. 4.30am - a fresh round of mortar attacks is launched on the base, killing two U.S. security officers. 5.30 - A heavily armed Libyan military unit . arrive at the CIA base to help evacuate the compound of U.S. personnel . to the Benghazi airport. From 6am - Roughly 30 Americans, as well as the bodies of . Stevens and the other three Americans killed during the attacks, were . loaded on planes and flown out of the city, several U.S. officials said. The dense smoke created by the fuel both made it hard for people at the compound to breathe and to organise a response to the attack. About 25 minutes after the initial report came into the CIA base, a team of about six agency security officers left their base for the public diplomatic mission compound. Over the succeeding 25 minutes, the CIA team approached the compound, and tried, apparently unsuccessfully, to get local Libyan allies to bring them a supply of heavier weapons, and eventually moved into the burning diplomatic compound, the intelligence official said. At around 11:10 p.m., a Defense Department drone, which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to help officials on the ground gather information. By 11:30, U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission had been rounded up except for Ambassador Stevens, who was missing, the intelligence official said. When they tried to drive out of the diplomatic compound to return to the CIA base, however, the convoy carrying U.S. evacuees came under fire. Once they got back to the CIA base, that installation itself came under fire from what the intelligence official described as small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. These patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes, the intelligence official said. Around the same time, a CIA security team . based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, landed at . Benghazi airport. Upon its arrival, however, the team spent some time . trying both to arrange local transport and to locate the missing . Ambassador Stevens. After some time . trying to solve these problems, the security team that had flown in . from Tripoli eventually arranged for an armed local escort and extra . transportation, but decided not to go the hospital where they believed . Stevens had been taken. In part this was because they had reason to . believe Stevens was likely dead, and because security at the hospital . was believed, at best, to be 'uncertain,' the intelligence official . said. Not long before dawn, the . reinforcements from Tripoli managed to take themselves and a convoy of . vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for an anticipated evacuation. However, . just after they arrived at the CIA base, the official said, a new round . of attacks on that facility was launched, this time with mortars.

"Premier League chief Richard Scudamore’s reward for delivering another astonishing TV rights deal for the clubs could be the executive chairmanship. A decision on that role is expected before the next PL meeting in March. And the timing couldn’t be better for Scudamore, with the clubs wanting to show their gratitude for £5billion coming their way from domestic deals alone. Scudamore’s promotion is said to have the support of up to 10 clubs already. And the PL’s nomination panel led by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, who had been expected to recommend the in-house option at the pre-Christmas clubs’ meeting, have not been in a hurry to appoint anyone else. Premier League chief Richard Scudamore has helped deliver a record £5billion TV rights deal for 2016-19 . Anthony Fry has been unable to fulfil the chairman’s role since suffering a serious stroke last March. And it is not ideal for the interim chairman, Harrogate lawyer Peter McCormick, to stay at the helm much longer when the PL are his prime clients. If Scudamore does become chairman, the PL are expected to appoint a robust independent director — not before time — to ensure King Richard doesn’t get everything his own way.

"Chinese military forces have been mobilised in Chinese occupied Tibet . after the fifth self-immolation in less than 48 hours was reported . today. Rumours of a sixth incident have yet to be confirmed as security has been tightened in Rebkong County in central China to prevent local people from joining a protest following incident number five. The latest tragedies came after the first documented case of a triple self-immolation yesterday, where three teenage Tibetan monks set themselves alight as they called for the freedom of Tibet. The monks set fire to themselves in Tibet as they begged for freedom from China . Several thousand people gathered in a . peaceful protest after an 18-year-old man named Jinpa set fire to . himself at around 5pm local time. Jinpa hailed from the same area as Tamdin Tso, a 23-year-old woman who self-immolated yesterday. The earlier triple self-immolation took place at approximately 3pm local time yesterday outside the gates of the local Public Security Bureau office in Gomang Township, Ngaba County, Eastern Tibet, which the Chinese refer to as Sichuan province. Tamdin Tso died in the name of freedom . The boys called out for freedom in . Tibet and for the return of the Dalai Lama as they set themselves on . fire. Security forces arrived at the scene almost immediately. The youngest monk, 15-year-old Dorjee, died at the scene. His companions, 16-year-olds Samdup and Dorjee Kyab, were taken to hospital by security forces. Their current whereabouts and wellbeing are unknown. Tamdin Tso, who had a five year-old son, died at the scene after setting herself alight, near Rongwo in Rebkong County, Eastern Tibet. Tamdin Tso took petrol from a motorbike and set fire to herself in the family's winter pasture. Her body was taken back to her family’s home and local people gathered there to pray. Free Tibet Director Stephanie Brigden said: 'These are the youngest Tibetans to set fire to themselves in protest at China’ s occupation. 'This is also the largest single incident, yet another indication of the escalation of protests in Tibet.' The five self-immolations follows reports from Rebkong, . known as Tongren in Chinese, that people have been threatened with two . years’ imprisonment for receiving or making international calls. Chinese authorities are tightening their grip on the area in conjunction with the Communist . party’s congress in Beijing. International campaign organisation . Free Tibet reported that in the days before the congress began, footage . of security forces on training exercises has been broadcast across the . Tibetan region. It warned local people that Chinese security forces will be . 'ready to do whatever it takes to crush those who are destroying . stability in the region to ensure that the 18th Party Congress is not . disrupted’ Free Tibet Director Stephanie Brigden . said there are grave concerns for the safety of the people of Rebkong . County following the footage. ‘As Congress opens, China must be held accountable for its actions in Tibet,’ she said. 'These protests are aimed at sending the next generation of China’s unelected regime a clear signal that Tibetans will continue to fight for their freedom despite China’s efforts to suppress and intimidate them.","A report of a sixth immolation has not been confirmed .

"Four-time Olympian speedskater and silver medalist Andy Gabel has been accused of sexually abusing a fellow skater in the 1990s. Bridie Farrell told public radio station WUWM in Milwaukee that she had sexual contact with Gabel repeatedly over several months in 1997 and 1998 while both were training in New York and Michigan. When the alleged abuse began, she was 15 and Gabel was 33. Gabel competed in short track and won a silver medal in the relay at Lillehammer in 1994. He also served a term as president of . U.S. Speedskating and is currently chairman of the short track committee . for the International Skating Union. Abuse? Bridie Farrell said that she had sexual contact with Andy Gabel repeatedly over several months in 1997 and 1998 while both were training in New York and Michigan. When the alleged abuse began, she was 15 and Gabel was 33 . Farrell recently returned to . speedskating after a six-year absence and is making a long-shot bid for a . spot on the U.S. team that will compete at the Sochi Games next year. She failed in three previous bids to qualify for the Olympics. The national governing body said it was not previously aware of any allegations against Gabel. 'Our current understanding is that it was not reported to anyone at U.S. Speedskating or the authorities at that time,' the organization said in a statement. 'We intend to look into this matter immediately to determine what action should be taken.' There was no immediate comment from Gabel. The Associated Press left a message on his cellphone. Farrell's lawyer, Jon Little, said the abuse began when Farrell and Gabel were training at the same club in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. According to Little, Gabel began paying a lot of attention to Farrell. He would let her drive his car, for instance, and he also sharpened her skates. 'She's star struck,' Little said, describing her state of mind at the time. Regret: 'I wish I had said something the day that it happened,' Farrell said. 'And if that person didn't believe me, that I told somebody else, and somebody else, until someone listened' There was no immediate comment from the ISU. But International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said, 'Clearly, any allegations of such a serious nature need to be fully investigated.' In any event, they represent another setback to a powerhouse U.S. Olympic sport, coming after a sexual abuse scandal in swimming. Dozens of coaches have been accused of abusing underage swimmers, including a former national team director, prompting USA Swimming to adopt a 'safe sport' program and go public with a list of everyone who has received a lifetime ban from the organization. Farrell's allegations are somewhat different in that the abuse allegedly began while she and Gabel were both still competing. But Little said it follows much the same pattern of what happened in swimming: a mentorlike figure taking advantage of a young athlete. The statute of limitations for a lawsuit has expired, Little said, so there are no plans to pursue legal action. He said Farrell decided to come forward because she wants to change the culture of Olympic sports in the U.S., something he described as a 'good old boys network.' 'They see their coaches sleeping with girls,' Little said. 'When they become a coach. ... (they) get access to sexual relationships with young, fit teenage girls – and it's just part of the culture. Everybody thinks that's OK.' Champion: Andy Gabel (center) is a four-time, short track speedskating U.S. Olympian and holds a silver medal as a member of the 1994 5000 meter Short Track relay team . In her interview with WUWM, Farrell said she knew from the beginning that her relationship with Gabel was inappropriate. 'I knew that because he made it be a secret,' she said. 'But I will say that the 15-year-old thought it was exciting.' Farrell said she didn't tell anyone what had happened for years. 'The first five to seven years after it happened, I was scared,' she told the radio station. 'I was petrified, because I was young and in speedskating, and I was knocking on the door to the junior national team, then the senior national team, and I didn't want to do anything to jeopardize that. 'Then,' she added, 'there was a period of my life when I didn't say anything because I realized I was hurt, and I was broken. 'And it took a long time and a lot of work and some pretty dark times to come to grips with it and put myself together.' Hopes: Farrell (circled) recently returned to speedskating after a six-year absence and is making a long-shot bid for a spot on the U.S. team that will compete at the 2014 Games. She failed in three previous bids to qualify for the Olympics . Connected: Andy Gabel (center) demonstrates the ticket-buying process for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City as Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney (right) looks on . 'I wanted to be close and real with friends in skating, but there was this big secret and there was this big part I wasn't disclosing,' she said. 'And in order for me to be honest and truly be friends with these people, I needed to be able to say, ""This is a huge thing I'm battling.""' Farrell said her biggest regret is waiting so long to come forward. 'I wish I had said something the day that it happened,' she said. 'And if that person didn't believe me, that I told somebody else, and somebody else, until someone listened.'

"Employment Minister Esther McVey has laughed off her new title of Queen of the Downing Street catwalk as 'fine if it inspires girls to go into politics'. The . former TV presenter was one of a succession of female MPs photographed . on the steps of Number 10 yesterday, even though some were taking up . more junior roles than men whose promotions were just announced on . Twitter. Speaking . after her promotion to now attend Cabinet, Miss McVey said she could only smile at the . coverage that her glamorous appearance had garnered. She told Sky News: ‘Well all I can say is that it's fantastic having women in powerful . positions in the newspapers and if that meant we were walking, the . paper might have called it, 'a catwalk' - we were walking into Number . 10 Downing Street. Scroll down for video . Employment Minister Esther McVey has laughed off her new title of Queen of the Downing Street catwalk (featured in today's Daily Mail) as 'fine if it inspires girls to go into politics' The former TV presenter was one of a succession of female MPs photographed on the steps of Number 10 yesterday, and featured in today's Daily Mail . ‘And for the last 15 years I have worked with kids from . inner city areas  - young girls who are looking for role models. They see . Nicky Morgan, Secretary of state for Education, and they’re thinking ""hey that’s . something could do.""’ David Cameron replaced a succession of older male ministers with up-and-coming Tory women in an attempt to make his top team more representative of the population. Although former TV host Miss McVey was arguably the star turn in Downing Street, one of the biggest winners was Liz Truss, who entered the Cabinet as Environment Secretary at the age of 38, making her the youngest female Cabinet minister of all time. The ice-cool mother-of-two,  increasingly tipped as a potential future Tory leader, replaced Owen Paterson, who clashed angrily with the Prime Minister as he was sacked after criticism of his handling of the horsemeat scandal, a cull of badgers and the winter floods. The other major promotion  was handed to Nicky Morgan, promoted from No 3 at the Treasury  to replace Michael Gove as Education Secretary. The Prime Minister declared his new team ‘reflected modern Britain’, but faced a backlash from some of the Tory old guard who accused him of culling middle-aged male ministers regardless of their merits. Former TV host Miss McVey was hailed the star turn in Downing Street yesterday after her glamorous turn before photographers . LIZ TRUSS: The new Environment Secretary is very patriotic in a red, white and blue ensemble consisting of a snake-skin navy dress and red jacket oddly finished with black patent shoes. Miss Truss, 38, MP for South West Norfolk and the former Junior Education and Children Minister, looked bright and sensible but a little bit too Eighties air hostess . PENNY MORDAUNT: The Minister for Planning and Coastal Communities was alone in braving the no-jacket look - after all she was brave enough to appear on TV in a swimsuit on Splash! This rather tight, bright, purple dress - the £115 'Viola' by LK Bennett - makes the most of 41-year-old Miss Mordaunt's figure. But who knows what's with the MP for Portsmouth North's wrinkly nude shoes and big bag? The new Leader of the House of Lords is to have her salary topped up by the Tory Party after it emerged she was to be paid less than her male predecessor, Lord Hill. Tina Stowell was announced as the new Lords leader, but there was embarrassment as Downing Street confirmed that she would be paid £78,891 a year, compared to £101,038 for Lord Hill. After Labour criticism, Tory sources said it had been decided to boost Lady Stowell’s salary using party funds. There was particular anger that not one existing woman minister was axed in Mr Cameron’s biggest clear-out since becoming party leader. MPs had expected Helen Grant, the sports minister, who has made a series of gaffes, to be dismissed, and there were question marks over the future of Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi after she poked fun at the Prime Minister’s Eton schooling. ‘What do you have to do as a woman to get sacked by Cameron?’ asked one ousted minister. ‘No matter how hopeless or how provocative you are, you won’t get sacked because he has to meet his quotas.’ Another senior Tory complained: ‘This really is the worst form of tokenistic gesture politics. Merit is out of the window.’ The number of Tory women attending . Cabinet rose to eight out of 27, just short of Mr Cameron’s target of a . third of his ministers being women. The new women join Home Secretary Theresa . May, International Development Secretary Justine Greening and Northern . Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers. NICKY MORGAN: Morgan, 41, MP for Loughborough, and now Education Secretary as well as Minister for Women and Equalities, chose a wintry, belted black dress, low nude pumps and a brown jacket with three-quarter-length sleeves that looks like half of another suit. At least she looks as if she's going to the office . PRITI PATEL: Treasury Minister Priti Patel, 42, must be the first person in that post to wear giant polka dots - her dress, from High Street favourite Wallis, costs £45 - though that navy jacket looks like Ken Clarke was its last owner and those sensible shoes could have been worn by Baroness Thatcher. The MP for Witham's bag is the more fashion-forward £595 'Hepburn' by Aspinal of London . The new leader of the Lords, Baroness Stowell, and Miss McVey have been promoted to join Baroness Warsi in also attending meetings without being full Cabinet ministers. In an indication of Mr Cameron’s keenness to highlight the influx of Tory women, a succession of female MPs was photographed outside No 10, though some were taking up more junior roles than men whose promotions were announced on Twitter. There were new ministerial jobs for Anna . Soubry, Priti Patel, Claire Perry, Amber Rudd and Penny Mordaunt, who . famously took part in ITV’s celebrity diving programme Splash! Therese . Coffey was made a Government whip. AMBER RUDD: The new Energy Department Minister looks both contemporary and work-appropriate in her straight-to-work navy suit, white top and bold necklace - although the trousers are a little tight. The 50-year-old MP for Hastings and Rye, a former Whip, chose a £695 Anya Hindmarch tote that seems to have the kitchen sink crammed into it. The red nails and I-mean-business glasses in her hand are a nice touch . ANNA SOUBRY: Elevated from Under-Secretary of State at Health to the same role at the MoD, Soubry, 57, always has the air of a Mrs Thatcher tribute, fake posh voice, tough manner and everything - and here she is edging towards the helmet hair and forbidding jackets of the Iron Lady, modernised by a lower-cut blouse, trousers and a high heeled £375 loafer by Tod's. The MP for Broxtowe's bag looks big enough to conceal a few missiles . Labour’s shadow women and equalities minister Gloria De Piero said: ‘The Tories have spent the last few days briefing that this would be the reshuffle which fixed David Cameron’s “women problem” but it’s turning into a damp squib. ‘It’s clear the Tories still won’t match the 44 per cent of Labour’s shadow cabinet under Ed Miliband.’ Veteran Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, who quit the Government after four decades at the top of Tory politics, expressed support for all-women shortlists as a way to further increase the number of women representing the party. The former Tory chancellor said the party . was ‘going too slowly’ in its efforts to boost the number of female . candidates, adding: ‘I would be in favour of all-women shortlists, which . I didn’t used to be.’ CLAIRE PERRY: Promoted from Assistant Whip to Junior Transport Minister, Claire Perry, 50, hit the high road in similar wedge shoes to Esther McVey and a smart navy dress, topped off by a 'statement' necklace and a bold teal jacket that looked about two sizes too big for the MP for Devizes . LADY STOWELL: The 47-year-old was the Queen's Baroness in Waiting and joins the Cabinet as Leader of the Lords and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but she's a bit mother-of-the-bride in this outfit by Precis Petite. The line is sold in Debenhams where the dress is £129 and the jacket £159 . Cheryl Gillan, who was Welsh secretary in Mr Cameron’s first Cabinet, said: ‘Don’t forget the Prime Minister only has 49 women out of all his troops to pick from. He has a finite pool from which to choose. ‘I think he has picked some very good people who have been here for four years and therefore have got some good political experience under their belts. ‘I wish all of those women well — not just the ones that have gone in but also the ones that have been  doing very, very good jobs for  this Government.’","Employment Minister laughed off title of 'Queen of Downing Street catwalk'

"Ten pounds might seem a little pricey for a tube of toothpaste. However, in an era of the £60 smart toothbrush and research suggesting a Hollywood smile is key to getting a good job, it could be a price worth paying. Unilever has unveiled a new toothpaste and serum it claims can regenerate 82per cent of tooth enamel after just three days of use. The new Regenerate Enamel Science Advanced Toothpaste contains calcium silicate and sodium phosphate, which effectively re-builds a new layer of white enamel on the teeth . Its new Regenerate Enamel Science . Advanced Toothpaste contains calcium silicate and sodium phosphate, . which effectively re-builds a new layer of white enamel on the teeth. The company is presenting the toothpaste as a beauty product that will sit alongside expensive age-defying creams and potions. The system helps to form a fresh supply of minerals which wrap and integrate in to the surface of the teeth. The . technology appears to work much like re-plastering a wall, filling any . microscopic holes caused by fizzy drinks or sugary foods to leave a . strong, smooth finish. The . company claims this has the effect of restoring teeth to their original . whiteness while making them much stronger, which means they are less . likely to develop cavities. Unilever . says the technology requires the use of a ‘Boosting Serum’ treatment, . which costs another £30, once a month and is applied using two . custom-fit mouth trays. Toothpaste . manufacturers are constantly looking for new science, pack designs or . marketing initiatives to make it appear new, exciting and able to . command a higher price. The company claims that test tube experiments have proved it can restore 82per cent of tooth enamel after three days . UK . sales are estimated at more than £400million a year, while the global . market is put at around £8billion, which delivers rich pickings to . global brands like Oral B and Colgate. Unilever . launched the new product yesterday at Selfridges in a bid to play up . its beauty product credentials - and it will be going in to the Boots . chain from June 11. Research . expert at Unilever, Fred Schafer, who developed the science behind the . toothpaste, said: ‘It is not generally understood that 80 per cent of . common teeth problems, such as cavities and yellowing, can be caused by . acid attacks and enamel erosion. ‘The erosion process happens to . everyone, at all ages, day after day and is caused by common items such . as carbonated drinks, fruit and vegetables, juices and wine. ‘The problem is that when enamel – the outermost protective layer of our teeth – is lost, our body cannot regenerate it. ‘This product is the world’s first system . able to reverse the early, invisible stages of this erosion process and . regenerate enamel with exactly the same mineral tooth enamel is made . of.’ The two key ingredients in the toothpaste are calcium silicate and sodium phosphate. Calcium silicate is most commonly derived from limestone and is used heavily in the production of building materials such as cement. It is also found in table salt and used as an antacid to treat heartburn. Sodium phosphate is a term for a variety of salts used in processed food to control acid levels and help soften bread. They feature in medicines such as treatments for constipation. The technology is the result of work at the Unilever research and development laboratory at Port Sunlight, on Merseyside, as well as teams in Milan and Shanghai. It was developed in collaboration with dental experts from International Oral Health Research Centres and the underlying science is due to be published in the Journal of Dentistry. The company claims that test tube experiments have proved it can restore 82per cent of tooth enamel after three days. As a result, teeth are said to be three times stronger. However, the company faces an uphill struggle to convince a sceptical public that Regenerate is any better than cheaper, rival products which claim to have a similar effect. For example, Sensodyne toothpaste, which costs £4.49, promotes itself on the basis it is possible to treat the pain of sensitive teeth by repairing vulnerable areas of tooth enamel with a formula that includes calcium and phosphate. Earlier this week, a leading British social scientist said the state of a person’s teeth, rather than their education, is becomingly increasingly important in terms of determining their job prospects and social status. Malcolm Gladwell argued that bad teeth . and being overweight are becoming the new benchmarks of inequality. He . suggested those with bad teeth are given a lower chance of success . because they are denied certain entry-level jobs. He said: ‘That’s kind of the way we’re . moving as the gap between the fit and the unfit grows. The teeth thing . and the obesity problems are the same: they are symptoms of the same set . of inferences that are being drawn. Malcolm Gladwell suggested those with bad teeth have a lower chance of success because they are denied certain jobs. Nowadays many, particularly celebrities like Victoria Beckham, get work done on their teeth . ‘I think those kinds of physical characteristics - that’s completely the next wave of discrimination.’ It is evident that people in the public eye increasingly feel under pressure to have a perfect white smile, which is permeating through the rest of the population. A poll conducted last year by VisionCritical also found that people see whiter teeth as an indication of wealth. The survey showed that people with whiter teeth were thought to earn £10,000 more on average than they actually did. Sparkling teeth also made them look up to five years younger and improved their employment potential by 10 per cent, results showed. Eddie Crouch from the British Dental Association has identified a noticeable gap between middle-class teenagers, whose parents are able to afford to have braces, and others who cannot.","Regenerate Enamel Science Advanced Toothpaste creates new layer .

"Australian children are to be banned from blowing out candles together on birthday cakes – because they could be puffing germs onto one another. And in what is seen as an attempt to ‘bubble wrap’ children, youngsters attending birthday parties will be told to take along individual cup cakes on which to place single candles. The extraordinary new guidelines from the country’s National Health and Medical Research Council has provoked an angry response from parents who say that the ‘nanny state’ is trying to take all the fun out of birthday parties. Sensible or a load of hot air? Children in Australia are to be banned from blowing out candles no birthday cakes together because of fears they will spread germs (file picture posed by model) Even doctors say that the birthday rules are going to far – because children are also now expected to wash their hands before jumping into a sandpit to play with their friends. Day care staff will also be instructed to wash toys, doorknobs floors and cushion covers every day to prevent the spread of germs. The guidelines state that kids who want to blow out a candle at birthday parties should bring their own cupcakes to avoid blowing germs over one another when they puff on a shared cake. ‘Children love to blow out their candles while their friends are signing “Happy birthday”’ states a guidelines document from the research council. 'Elf and safety gone mad: The new guidelines also say that children will be expected to wash their hands before jumping into a sandpit to play with their friends (file picture) But it adds: ‘To prevent the spread of germs when the child blows out the candles, parents should either provide a separate cupcake, with a candle if they wish, for the birthday child.’ Alternative, it says, enough cupcakes should be provided for the other children – or a large cake that can be cut up into portions and shared should be made available. Turning to sandpits, the council says that children must wash their hands with alcohol sanitiser before and afterwards. The guidelines have astonished Australian Medical Association president Mr Steve Hambleton. ‘If somebody sneezes on a cake, I probably don’t want to eat it either – but if you’re blowing out candles, how many organisms are transferred to a communal cake, for goodness sake?’ he told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph. Mr Hambleton also attacked the new sandpit rules, saying that all that was necessary was for children to wash their hands before they ate. ‘It’s normal and healthy to be exposed to a certain amount of environmental antigens that building up our immune systems. ‘If you live in a plastic bubble you’re going to get infections (later in life) that you can’t handle,’ he told the paper.

"Profits made by energy firms on household bills have more than doubled in a year, damning new figures reveal. As the Big Six companies drive through price hikes of up to 10 per cent, it also emerged that the costs to them of buying gas and electricity has remained almost unchanged since autumn 2012. Increases in what energy companies pay for gas and electricity have added just £10 to household bills, but profit margins added £50 in a year. Price hikes: Despite gas and electricity wholesale and operating costs remaining almost unchanged since autumn 2012, the Big Six companies have pushed through price hikes of up to 10% . Soaring profits: This graph shows how energy firms have seen their profits soar as bills go up. The wholesale energy cost has remained relatively stable . Bosses responsible for crippling rises this winter are due to be grilled by MPs tomorrow about claims they are driving up costs to make even bigger profits while leaving customers to choose between heating and eating. David Cameron is under intense pressure to tackle soaring bills, after Labour demanded a two-year freeze and former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax to help the elderly to keep warm this winter. Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises, with ScottishPower bills going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. The firms have variously blamed rising wholesale prices, bills for upgrading gas mains and electricity cables and extra green levies imposed by the government. But official figures released by energy regulator Ofgem reveal company profits have doubled in a year. Mr Cameron said last week: ‘I think it is wrong for bills to go up when wholesale prices are not going up substantially, but we have to look at the causes of why bills are going up and act on those causes rather than just have some sort of blanket policy that doesn't work.’ Ofgem analysis shows that the average bill stood at £1,320 this month, up £70 or 5.6 per cent on the same month last year. The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . Wholesale energy costs – which make up the singled biggest part of the bill - have barely changed, up just 1.67 per cent or £10 in a year. VAT, operating and other costs make up £1,255 of the bill, up £40 or 3.29 per cent. However the biggest increase is the average net profit margin made on bills, up 111 per cent from £45 in 2012 to £95 now. Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy secretary, said: 'Energy companies always blame rising global energy prices for putting up people's bills, but these figures show that under David Cameron they've been increasing their profits on the back of spiralling energy bills for hard-pressed households. 'If energy companies won't treat . their customers fairly, then people deserve tough action from the . Government. But David Cameron shows how out of touch he is, refusing to . act. That's why Labour would freeze energy bills for 20 months and . create a tough new watchdog with the power to force energy companies to . cut their prices when the cost of energy falls.' Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure to tackle soaring energy bills but came under fire last week when he suggested 'rolling back' green levies which he claims are pushing up prices . The revelation will fuel public anger at near double-digit rises in bills at a time when wages are up by around one per cent. Ofgem admits that overall wholesale costs have soared in the last decade, up by around 140 per cent for electricity and 240 per cent for gas. Although in the last year wholesale costs have barely changed. However, power firms insist that future prices for them to buy in supplies for this winter have risen. The wholesale price of gas for use this winter is 8 per cent higher than the price of gas for use last winter, Ofgem says. The wholesale price of electricity is 13 per cent higher. Mr Cameron sparked a furious coalition row last week when he vowed to ‘roll back’ the green levies which he says are forcing up bills. Over many years ‘extras’ have been added on all bills to pay to help the elderly heat their homes and cut the cost of energy efficiency measures like insulation. Ofgem estimates that in the last decade environmental and social costs have risen from £10 to over £100 on the average bill. In the last year they have risen by around £10 to £115 of an average annual dual fuel household bill. More increases are expected. However, the energy firms disputed the way Ofgem calculated the figures. British Gas said: ‘The prices that individual suppliers pay depend on their own hedging strategies, and the Ofgem methodology is, at best, an approximation of what those hedging profiles are. ‘We buy a certain amount of gas more than two years in advance, and if you look at the 24 month figure to October 2013, there has been an 18 per cent increase in the wholesale cost.’ SSE insisted it was ‘simply false’ to suggest wholesale costs had not risen. A spokesman added: ‘This is very much a global market and we are seeing increased international competition for supplies, which is putting up prices.’ The . simplest, and often best, way to slash your energy bills is to use an online . service that can compare all the best tariffs on offer for you.

"The first woman to have her own seat on the New York Stock Exchange, left a large chunk of her will to her pet chihuahua. Muriel 'Mickie' Siebert passed away August 24 at the age of 84 and designated $100,000 in her will towards taking care of her dog, Monster Girl. Ms Siebert was a pioneer on Wall Street, buying her seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1967 for $445,000. Hairy heir: Muriel Siebert gave $100,000 in her will to Monster Girl, her pet chihuahua . First female: Muriel Siebert was the first woman to get elected to the New York Stock Exchange - a feat she accomplished in 1967 . Monster Girl will now be taken care of by Ms Siebert's friend Lynda Fox-Frazer. 'I request that my dog not be left alone for long period of time during the day,' she wrote in the will, which was filed in Manhattan Surrogate's Court today. Ms Siebert never married or had children of her own. Her only surviving family member is her sister Elaine Siebert, whom she gifted $1.5million in a trust. Animal welfare was a cause close to Ms Siebert's heart and so she also designated $10,000 to go to The Animal Medical Center in Manhattan. She says that money must be gifted while Monster Girl is still living. Most of Siebert's estate goes towards her foundation which 'supports the furtherance of education in personal financial literacy and the humane support of animals.' Her foundation focuses on supporting animals 'owned by the elderly who are financially challenged'. What she left behind: Muriel Siebert passed away on August 24 at the age of 84. Details of her will were released today . Ms Siebert was also generous with her friends. She left one friend, George Jones, $360,000. Six . of her girlfriends were allowed to choose three items from her jewelry . collection, but they have to agree on how to split it. If not, then her estate's executors will make the final decision. Trailblazer: Ms Siebert at work in 2001, when she was head of stock trading firm Siebert Financial Corporation, which she started . Ms Siebert was born in Cleveland on September 12, 1928, the daughter of dentist Irwin Siebert, and his wife Margaret. Generous sister: Ms Siebert was survived by her sister Elaine. She left Elaine with a $1.5million trust . She attended Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve) but left after two years when her father became sick. In 1954 she moved to New York with just '$500, a Studebacker and a dream.' She worked as a security analyst until she  decided to purchase her own seat on the New York Stock Exchange. The first nine men she asked to sponsor her application declined and the tenth agreed. The exchange said that if she was admitted it would cost her $445,000 and that a bank would need to lend her $300,000 - an amount the exchange had never asked an applicant before. Two years later she secured a loan from Chase Manhattan and on December 28, 1967 was elected as the first female member on the exchange. It was a groundbreaking moment for women on Wall Street, but for 10 years she would continue to be the only one of her sex at the NYSE. During her time there, she promoted . the rights of women - eventually getting a women's restroom installed on . the seventh floor near her favorite luncheon club. She threatened that if the restroom was not installed by the end of the year, she would have a  porta-potty installed. In . recent years, Ms Siebert has been celebrated for her championship of . gender equality on Wall Street, but she constantly warned that the women . had a long way to go. Glass ceiling shattered: Ms Siebert was the first woman on the NYSE, but it took 10 years for more women to join her. She was constantly warning about how women weren't fully equal in the boy's club of finance . 'Firms are doing what they have to do, legally,' she said at a 1992 luncheon in her honor. 'But women are not coming into Wall Street in large numbers, and they are still not making partner and are not getting into the positions that lead to the executive suites. There's an old-boy network. you just have to keep fighting.' In addition to her life at the NYSE, Ms Sierbet served as Superintendent of Banks for the State of New York. When she found out that then-Governor Hugh Carey had appointed her to the position, she remembered thinking 'Mickie, you know you're a college dropout. You've done pretty well as a college dropout.'","Muriel 'Mickie' Siebert was the first woman to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange .

"The founder of the controversial Ground Zero Mosque allegedly spent more than $3 million that had been donated to charity to fund a first-class lifestyle that involved 'lavish trips, luxury sports cars and personal real estate.' Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf was slapped with a $20 million lawsuit by, Robert Leslie Deak, a major backer to his nonprofit who alleges the wild spending in the papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. Rauf's charity, the Cordoba Initiative, received $3 million from the Malaysian as well as another $167,000 from private donors. That money was meant to counter anti-Islamic sentiment but instead went to Rauf's private life, the lawsuit alleges. Big spender: Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf allegedly spent more than $3 million that was meant for charity for personal gain . Deak also claims that Rauf 'falsified' the nonprofit’s 'tax returns for 2008, 2009 and 2010 by failing to report receipt of funds from foreign sources and transfers of funds.' Rauf's lawyer adamantly denied the allegations, the New York Post reported. 'He's going to vigorously defend them and show that it has no basis,' the lawyer, Paul Knight, said of his client.Rauf served as the Imam of the Ground Zero Mosque until being ousted in January 2011. The mosque drew criticism from family members of those who died on 9/11 because it is just two blocks from the site of the terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000. The mosque and community center opened in September 2011 but only after its developer admitted they should have done more to calm concerns of those who lost loved ones on 9/11.

But he said they're good intent should have been mixed with more of a dialogue with the opposition. 'The biggest mistake we made was not . to include 9/11 families,' he said at the time of the site's opening, noting that the advisory board . includes at least one 9/11 family member.

"Crumbs Bakery has learned the hard way that building a business on a fad is no cakewalk. When Crumbs, the New York City-based chain that built its business around cupcakes, shuttered all of its 48 remaining locations Monday, it seemed like an abrupt ending for a company that opened a decade ago to ride the wave of popularity of the sugary treat sparked by the TV series Sex and The City. But Crumbs' rise and fall isn't surprising when considering the company's dependence on a culinary craze. In fact, it's the latest cautionary tale for businesses that devote their entire menus to variations of a single product. Scroll down for video . Harbinger of doom: Crumbs shuttered all its 48 locations a week after the struggling cupcake shop operator was delisted from the Nasdaq . How Crumbs crumbled: Experts say Crumbs Bakery's bankruptcy was caused by over-expansion at a time when demand for cupcakes leveled off . Krispy Kreme, for instance, expanded rapidly in large part on the cult-like following of its doughnuts. But sales started declining and the company ended up closing some locations. Last year, restaurant industry researcher Technomic said Krispy Kreme had 249 locations, down from 338 a decade ago. The chain has broadened its menu more recently. Executives at Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary later this week, weren't available for comment. A similar fate befell Mrs. Fields, which is known for its cookies. The chain has suffered in part because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies, and it was down to 230 stores last year, from 438 a decade ago. TCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago. Part of the chain's problem is the competition, given the proliferation of frozen yogurt places. A representative for the parent company of Mrs. Fields and TCBY wasn't immediately available. Companies that only offer one item can fall victim to a number of risks. For one, trendy products tend to attract competition from big and small players that want to jump on the bandwagon. For instance, Starbucks and Cold Stone Creamery have been trying to capitalize on the cupcake trend with cake pops and ice cream cupcakes, respectively. Where it all started: The cupcake craze can be traced back to Sex and the City (pictured), which popularized the frosted mini-cakes sold by Magnolia bakery in the 90s . Diversified: Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies and brownies . Being beholden to a single item also makes companies more susceptible to customers' whims and changing tastes. There's always a new fad: frozen yogurt; chopped salads; freshly squeezed juices, and even gourmet toast. Entrepreneurs may be eager to open stores selling these products, but there's always the danger that fickle customers will move on to the next thing. 'A cupcake shop today can't survive on just cupcakes,' said Darren Tristano, a Technomic analyst. To combat the risks, many chains diversify their menus. And several have prospered by moving beyond their flagship products. Dunkin' Donuts, for instance, has been pushing aggressively into specialty drinks and sandwiches, with a focus on boosting sales after its morning rush hour. And Starbucks has introduced a range of new foods and drinks in its cafes, including premium bottled juices and salad boxes. The coffee chain even plans to expand wine and beer offering in evenings to as many as 1,000 locations over the next several years. Magnolia, another popular New York City cupcake shop, is credited for sparking the cupcake craze after it was featured in Sex and the City. Downsizing: Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary this week, had 249 locations last year, down from 338 a decade ago . Streamlined: The chain Mrs Fields took a hit  because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies and closed down nearly half of its 438 storefronts . Freeze out: The frozen yogurt business TCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago, because of stiff competition . The chain, which opened in 1996, has endured while many of the cupcake shops that opened up in its wake — including Crumbs — focused on just cupcakes. That's in part because Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies, brownies and banana pudding. Sara Gramling, Magnolia's spokeswoman, said the company is learning about the dangers of focusing too heavily on one product, as well as expanding too quickly. 'We'll be mindful of those lessons,' she said. Still, some chains manage to persevere by carving out a niche where there aren't many competitors; Auntie Anne's and Cinnabon have expanded locations over the years. As for Crumbs, the company noted in a statement late Monday that it was evaluating its 'limited remaining options.' That will include a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Crumbs did not provide comment beyond its statement. While some business analysts were quick to conclude that Crumbs’ collapse heralded the end of the decade-long cupcake trend, others suggested that the bakery chain was a special case. Decade-long fad: Crumbs first opened its doors in March 2003 in Manhattan. The company went public in 2011 but has been suffering as the cupcake boom has deflated . David Sax, author of The Tastemakers: Why We’re Crazy for Cupcakes but Fed Up With Fondue, described Crumbs’ failure as ‘a classic tale of overexpansion and borrowing too much money,’ adding that it was no indicative of the state of the cupcake industry at large, reported the Washington Post. In Sax’s retelling of the story, Crumbs’ fatal flaw was that the chain continued opening more and more stores even as demand for cupcakes levelled off. By 2013, the bakery had 70 locations, which brought in less than $650,000 each. Last cupcake: Before the Crumbs empire crumbled, employees at Likeable Media in New York City bought this sprinkled cupcake from the now-shuttered shop on 42nd Street for $3.95 . Four years earlier, each of Crumbs' 25 locations raked in $1.2million in sales. Sax insisted that the frosted mini-cakes have a bright future. ‘This is much more a story about one company’s mismanagement of its product line than it is about the hatred or falling off of one particular American pastry,’ he said. ‘When the housing market crashed in 2007 or 2008, it wasn’t like people stopped investing in real estate. ‘The death of Crumbs doesn’t mean the end of every other cupcake bakery.’ The news of the chain’s bankruptcy comes less than two weeks after the Nasdaq announced it would stop trading Crumbs, which went public in 2011. Crumbs had seen a steep decline in profitability since its debut on the market: In its quarterly report from March, the company posted an accumulated deficit of $28.8million. Outside the Crumbs on 42nd Street, near Times Square, disappointment was palpable Tuesday afternoon. A pregnancy craving brought Neicy Robinson of the Bronx to another Crumbs location before she walked to the Bryant Park store and realized they had all closed. ‘I don’t know what’s going on. I’m so lost,’ she said. ‘I just want some cupcakes!’ Lots of dough: The bidding on the baked rarity started at $250, but those who wish to buy it now can do so for $1,000 . But those craving that one final sugary, moist bite still have a chance to get their hands on the last Crumbs cupcake, USA Today reported. Before the Crumbs empire crumbled, employees at Likeable Media in New York City picked up a sprinkled cupcake from the now-shuttered shop on 42nd Street for $3.95. Instead of wolfing down the dessert, enterprising staffers decided to put it up for sale on eBay with an opening bid of $250. Those diehard fans of the defunct bakery who do not want to wait until Friday when the bidding ends can snap up the cupcake right now for $1,000.","Crumbs Bakery shuttered all its remaining 48 locations Monday .

"Blow: Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, whose claims Scotland would not have to apply to join groups such as the EU are sounding increasingly unlikely (file picture) If Scotland voted for independence it could have to re-apply to a whole host of international organisations including the EU and the World Bank, laywers said. It would also have to renegotiate 14,000 international treaties, according to legal advice commissioned by Whitehall. The report is a huge blow to Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, whose claims Scotland would not have to apply to join groups such as the EU are sounding increasingly unlikely. The legal advice concludes that Scotland would become a ‘new state’ while the remaining United Kingdom would be considered a ‘continuing state’. So if Scotland seceded, only the rest of the UK would continue to have the same rights, obligations and powers under international law. The UK is a party to 14,000 treaties and is a member of groups such as the UN, the EU, Nato, Interpol and the International Monetary Fund. The 57-page report, written by Professors James Crawford and Alan Boyle, raises the prospect that Scotland will have to apply to re-join many of these if it votes for independence in a referendum next year. David Cameron said: ‘Those glorious Olympics last summer reminded us just what we were capable of when we pull together: Scottish, English, Welsh, Northern Irish, all in the same boat – sometimes literally. If you told many people watching those Olympics around the world that we were going to erect barriers between our people, they’d probably be baffled. Put simply: Britain works. Britain works well. Why break it?’ Addressing matters of the 'heart and head', Mr Cameron said Britain has built up 'world-renowned' institutions such as the NHS and BBC, and 'fought for freedom in two world wars, leaving 'unbreakable bonds'. He said: 'I have no time for those who say there is no way Scotland could go it alone. 'I know first-hand the contribution Scotland and Scots make to Britain's success - so for me there's no question about whether Scotland could be an independent nation. 'The real question is whether it should - whether Scotland is stronger, safer, richer and fairer within our United Kingdom or outside it.' Scotland’s deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Mr Cameron had simply reminded people that ‘he heads a government that Scotland didn’t vote for and that independence is the only way to ensure that Scotland always gets the government it votes for’. A report from the First Minister's council of economic advisers suggested Scotland should retain sterling as currency in the event of independence. Holding on to the pound would also benefit the rest of the UK as a key trading partner, the report concludes. Professor Crawford, of Cambridge University, is an Australian State Counsel, similar to a QC. Professor Boyle is an expert on international disputes. Their opinion was requested last year by the Foreign and Cabinet offices in London and the Advocate General Office in Edinburgh. Agreement: If Scotland gained independence, following a referendum agreed by Alex Salmond and David Cameron last year, Scotland would have to renegotiate 14,000 international treaties .","Scotland would have to re-apply to organisations including EU .

On top: The actress on the February cover of Vanity Fair, on stands now . On Monday, her family confirmed to People the 37-year-old had passed away in what appears to be an overdose. 'It is with deep sadness that the family of Nancy Motes ... confirms that she was found dead in Los Angeles yesterday of an apparent drug overdose,' the statement read. 'There is no official report from the Coroner's office yet. The family is both shocked and devastated.' She was discovered in the bathtub of a home by her fiancé John Dilbeck and pronounced dead at 2:12 p.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles Coroner's Office told MailOnline. It is believed she was found at a house where she was pet-sitting for a friend. Today, Ed Winter, assistant chief at the LA County Coroner's Office, said: ‘The autopsy has been completed and the cause of death has been deferred depending on the toxicology reports. This can take between six and eight weeks. ‘A number of prescription medications were found in the bathroom area as were illegal drugs. We are still investigating whether they were hers or not. We’re not releasing what illegal drugs they were. ‘It could be a possible suicide, but we don’t know the cause of death yet for sure, which is depending on further investigation. It’s more complicated as she also had some medical issues, so we’re not sure what happened at the moment. 'We are not being specific what those issues are, but it could mean a number of reasons for her death, she could have been taking a bath and had a heart attack. We just don’t know at this stage.' Julia's rep did not return calls to MailOnline. The actress cancelled an appearance at an Academy Awards luncheon on Monday. Nancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV's Glee. Julia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy's dad was Michael Motes and Julia's is the late Walter Grady Roberts. In August the blonde had complained about growing up in the shadow of the Pretty Woman star, who has been working the awards circuit this year for her turn in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep. Thinner: Nancy Motes looked considerably thinner in August 2013 as she grabbed coffee near her home in Santa Monica . The younger sibling had said she was known as Julia's 'fat little sister' and said the Oscar-winner had taunted her about her weight, leading her to undergo weight loss surgery in June 2012. Roberts, 46, made her feel embarrassed and ashamed of her weight, according to Nancy, which peaked at 20st. She resorted to a £20,000 gastric bypass operation last year. 'It makes me feel incredibly hurt and very sad,' Motes said. 'When you're in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it's intimidating.' Her other siblings include Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, 48, who are also actors. Actress Emma Roberts is the daughter of Eric. 'I think that growing up as Pretty Woman's little sister has definitely made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside,' she added. 'A lot of my life I felt judged for my weight.' Busy woman: Roberts has been working the awards . circuit for her turn in August: Osage County, which she did here on . January 18 while attending the Screen Actors Guild Awards . Motes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as hooker Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman. The actress, who had won a Golden Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second for Pretty Woman. Motes, who described herself as an 'awkward' child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of her 'very pretty and very popular' sister. She said: 'When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just let me know that I was definitely overweight. She would make it quite clear to me and in a not so nice manner. 'Julia did not want to see me go down that path [of acting] … So I just got a lot of criticism from Julia, which was very discouraging for me.' After graduating from high school in 1995, Motes auditioned for roles in Hollywood while working as a waitress. But she could not afford to continue so returned to Georgia. Niece: Emma Roberts, pictured Monday with Evan Peters, was Nancy's niece . Three years ago Nancy moved back to Los Angeles, after meeting her fiancé John Dilbeck. But she claimed Roberts started taunting her about her weight again days after she arrived. With her weight soaring, she finally decided to have a gastric bypass fitted. Motes said she could not afford the £20,000 fee, but rather than ask Roberts, who is worth £90million, for financial help, she took out a loan. She had lost 7st since the operation last June and had planned on marrying in May. However, RadarOnline reported last year that Julia planned to boycott the nuptials because she didn't like the groom and didn't want to get stuck paying for the wedding.

"Publishing executives are reportedly 'on notice' for allegedly paying Hillary Clinton $14 million for her highly-anticipated memoir which sold just 161,000 copies in its first three weeks. Sources told the New York Post 'there’s lots of finger-pointing going on at (publisher) Simon & Schuster' over the expensive deal. Although the publisher sent one million copies of 'Hard Choices' to stores, a low 85,000 were sold in the first week before sales plummeted in the subsequent two weeks. The book hit stores on June 10. Scroll down for video . Tough times: Hillary Clinton was reportedly given a $14 million advance for her memoior 'Hard Choices' which has not been selling well . Another insider told the Post that while 161,000 sales for a normal book without such a huge advance would be 'OK', executives are wringing their hands over the former Secretary of State's costly tome. Clinton reportedly got $8 million for her last book for the publisher, 'Living History,' which sold more than 600,000 in its first week in 2003 and more than 1.15 million copies overall. To make matters worse, Clinton's new book was bumped from the No. 1 spot on the New York Times best-seller list this week by journalist Edward Klein's 'Blood Feud'. Klein's book describes the acrimonious alliance between the Barack and Michelle Obama, and Bill and Hillary Clinton. The explosive book, which has soared to the top of Amazon, chronicles the 'deep rivalry' between the political families. Competition: Hillary Clinton's memoir has dropped to No. 2 on The New York Times Best Sellers list behind 'Blood Feud' by Edward Klein which chronicles the tensions between the Obamas and Clintons (pictured here in November 2013) From the beginning, Clinton's book has struggled to gain the necessary traction to meet the enormous expectations in sales thrust upon it by publishers. Total sales for the book are unavailable, as recent ebook sales have not been disclosed, but roughly 15,000 digital copies of the book were known to have been bought the first week. When asked about the unexpected unpopularity of 'Hard Choices', a spokesman for publishing company wrote off the memoir's shaky start. 'It will be selling for years — in hardcover, e-book, audio and paperback — and we expect it to be a successful book for Simon & Schuster as well as our many international partners,' Simon & Schuster spokesman Cary Goldstein said according to the NY Times. Initial sales usually account for 30 percent of a book's total sales, meaning Clinton's book would have needed to sale 300,000 copies in the first week to stay on schedule. Reader reaction hasn't been quite up to snuff, either. On Amazon, a large majority of reviewers gave the book one star, with users frequently complaining that the book was a waste of money. 'What a waste of paper. Or for Kindle/Nook readers, screen space. What was Simon and Schuster thinking when they paid her? Not profits for sure,' Virginia resident George V. Caylor commented. 'Too bad kindle books can't be used for toilet paper. One star is five too many for this book. Avoid like a plague,' Cornith, Texas, resident D. L. White said of the book. 'No matter how you feel about Hillary, this book is boring and very poorly written. It's not worth reading unless you need something to put you to sleep,' a user name Richard wrote on June 21.","Clinton allegedly received a $14m advance for 'Hard Choices' which has sold only 161k copies .

"Tragic: Avery Lane died at age six from complications from influenza . A Maine mother whose six-year-old daughter died of influenza is facing heartbreak all over again after her little girl's grave was vandalized three times - including twice in two days this week. Avery Lane's parents adorned her final resting place in Fairfield, Maine, with a colorful pinwheel, wind chimes and other small tributes to the child they lost in December 2012. A small bench also sits beside her headstone, where her family can sit and visit the grave site. Detectives are now investigating whether Avery's grave was targeted because the lovingly decorated site, which is in a Quaker cemetery, isn't in line with the Quaker tradition of simplicity, Fairfield Police Chief Thomas Gould confirmed to MailOnline. The wider community has responded with outrage over the vandalism and has raised $1,800 for a reward to help catch the vandals. 'It’s . the grave of a young child. It’s seen as a heartless thing. People are . upset because this woman lost her child at a very young age and then has to go through this,' Chief Gould said. The Portland Press Herald . reports that on Sunday night, Kennebec County Sheriff's Deputy Jacob . Pierce stopped by Avery's grave and found that it had been disturbed. The wind chime had been knocked down and broken and the pinwheel had been removed. Deputy Pierce . told the Press Herald that he was working on December 11, 2012 when . Avery's father called police that she was having respiratory problems . from the flu. The first grader died in Deputy Pierce's arms. The deputy, who . just returned from an eight-month tour in Afghanistan with the Nation . Guard, said he sobbed when he found the damage to the little girl's grave site.

No other graves in the Friends Cemetery of Fairfield are decorated with toys or trinkets and no other grave sites were disturbed, the Press Herald reports. The plot belongs to the family but they have no affiliation to the church. MailOnline could not reach anyone at Friends Cemetery of Fairfield or at the Fairfield Friends Meeting for comment. Paul Cates, a former Quaker minister in a neighboring town told the Press Herald that the colorful decorations weren't in keeping with Quaker values. 'We don’t have anything like that in our cemetery,' Mr Cates said. 'The idea of decorating with pinwheels and toys and stuff like that is not in the tradition of the Friends.' Chief Gould told MailOnline that his investigators were looking into the possibility that grave was targeted by Quakers upset by the decorations. He said his detectives were following leads and expects to announce a break in the case on Friday. The Friends of Fairfield Cemetery has no other graves that are decorated. The Quakers generally believe in living a simple, unadorned life .","Avery Lane died from influenza in December 2012 .

"A U.S. congressman calling for the release of classified material from a report into 9/11 has warned there would be 'anger, frustration, and embarrassment' if the redacted pages were made public. Representative Thomas Massie has joined a call for the government to declassify 28 pages redacted from the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rep Thomas Massie has joined a call for the government to declassify 28 pages redacted from the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 . Speaking on Wednesday to The Glenn Beck Program on The Blaze TV, Massie said it was important the American public are able to read the report, although he warned there will be 'anger, frustration, and embarrassment when these 28 pages finally come out.' Massie has backed a House Resolution, introduced in December last year by representatives Walter Jones and Stephen Lynch, calling upon President Barack Obama to declassify the redacted pages. At a press conference earlier this month, Massie explained how he felt after reading the report. He said: 'I had to stop every couple of pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years leading up to that. 'It challenges you to rethink everything and so I think the whole country needs to go through that. 'It's going to be difficult and it could be embarrassing, but that is no reason to keep the truth from the American people.'

"Google CEO Larry Page stopped talking to co-founder and long-time friend Sergey Brin after his affair with Google Glass marketer Amanda Rosenberg emerged, friends have revealed. Brin, 40, split with his wife and mother of his two children, Anne Wojcicki, last year after she found 'alarming' emails between Brin and 27-year-old Rosenberg. The pair then began dating. But this did not sit well with Page, his co-founder and a friend since college who had witnessed Brin's blossoming romance with Wojcicki when the couple met in 1998. 'It was inappropriate,' a source told Vanity Fair of Brin and Rosenberg's relationship. 'Insanely upset': Larry Page, left, reportedly did not speak to fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin, right, after it emerged he was having an affair with a 27-year-old Google Glass employee . 'Larry is so ethically . strict... I heard Larry was insanely upset by this whole situation . and wasn't talking to Sergey' for a time. Brin and Wojcicki, who had been married for six years before they split 10 months ago, began drifting apart after the launch of Google Glass, the article noted. In its early days, Rosenberg, a marketer on the project, had spent time with Wojcicki, a prominent Biotech analyst and businesswoman, to understand how to target mothers with the gadget. The two women became friends at the end of 2012 - close enough that Wojcicki bought Rosenberg a Christmas present - and Brin and Wojcicki went out to dinners with Rosenberg and her then boyfriend, Hugo Barra, a high-ranking executive for Google's Android team, Vanity Fair reported. Other woman: Amanda Rosenberg works as a marketer for Google Glass, where she met Brin . Model employee: Rosenberg, pictured wearing Google Glass, was friends with Brin's wife before the split . But around the same time, Wojcicki came across emails that 'caused her alarm', a source said, and she approached Rosenberg about it. In April 2013, Brin moved out of their $7 million Los Altos home to another property they owned nearby but they kept the split quiet until August. At the time, Rosenberg continued to date Barra, an M.I.T graduate and prized member of the creative product team, while also seeing Brin, the article noted. Barra, then unaware of the affair, was planning to move to Hong Kong with Rosenberg after being offered a job by a Chinese mobile phone company, sources said. But in May, Rosenberg broke up with him without giving him a reason, and after the Brin relationship publicly emerged a few months later, he announced he was moving to Hong Kong alone. Together: Brin is pictured in September 2012 with his wife, businesswoman Anne Wojcicki, months before they split. The couple were married for six years and have two children together . In January, Rosenberg revealed on her blog that she was being treated for depression. 'It became increasingly difficult for me to make decisions. I had no empathy for anyone, and I started to crave solitude,' the British-born Google employee wrote. 'The worst part was that it became harder to face people, even those I loved. It felt much better to be holed up on my sofa for unhealthy periods of time. 'Darkness surged through my veins and permeated my eyeballs. All the feelings I’d hoarded over the years were now rushing through me in one go and all I wanted was a one-way ticket back to numbsville.' She added: 'I'm in treatment and have been for 6 weeks. Reaching out for help is the single best and bravest decision I have ever made.' Linked: Before her relationship with Brin, Rosenberg dated Hugo Barra, who worked for Google Android . A family friend told Vanity Fair that her relationship with Brin has also seen its troubles. 'The two of them have horrible, screaming fights,' the friend said. 'It's part of the passion, the chemical attraction.' Brin and Wojcicki, who shared a $30 billion wealth and have two children under the age of six, are not divorced and have no plans to seek one, according to Vanity Fair. The . article also notes that it was not the only affair at Google, which . does not explicitly ban inter-office relationships. Page and Yahoo! CEO . Marissa Mayer also had a relationship, it claims. Rosenberg joined Google after graduating with a communications degree from Leeds University in England. She had previously been educated at £31,000-a-year Marlborough school, where Kate Middleton had previously been a pupil. Pippa Middleton was two years ahead of Rosenberg. In an internet profile Miss . Rosenberg wrote of herself: ‘I’m part of the master race that is the . Chinese Jew or Chew, if you will. 'Born in Hong Kong but bred in the UK. A . misanthrope who’s bad at maths, so I got the worst of both worlds.’ Elsewhere . she declared that her motto is: ‘He who hesitates is a damned fool.’ Miss Rosenberg is understood to have an English father and a Hong Kong . Chinese mother who worked as an investment banker. Long-time friends: Page and Brin, pictured in 2003, met while at Stanford University in the mid 1990s . She initially worked for the internet giant in London before last year moving to San Francisco to work at its Silicon Valley nerve center. She soon won a role promoting Google Glass, the glasses which enable users to film and broadcast over the internet everything they see non-stop, worrying privacy campaigners. She also came up with the idea to say 'OK, Glass' to switch it on.","Sergey Brin and Anne Wojcicki split last year after she found 'alarming' messages between him and Google employee Amanda Rosenberg, 27 .

A Canadian politician says she has become a victim of cyberbullying after a teenager posted a topless photo of her online. Lenore Zann, a member of the Nova Scotia legislature said the picture was taken from an episode in the Showtime series The L Word, a drama series portraying the lives of a group of lesbian, bisexual, straight and transgender people and their friends. Ms. Zann appeared topless in one episode that was shot in 2008, in which she played a small part in a prison shower scene. Caught out: Lenore Zann claims she was a victim of cyber-bullying. 'I never signed on for having that image used for another purpose,' she said in an interview . When the photo was tweeted to her @lenorezann two weeks ago, she asked the sender to remove the image, which she said included a message that said, 'What happened to the old Lenore?' The tweeter, NickScissons @Ncissons, a 17-year old high school student from Truro, said he meant it as a joke. 'I just thought it would be funny, pretty much,' he said. 'It was just meant to be funny and got out of hand I guess,' he said. But 'she was on that show voluntarily and she knew that image was out there and I don't think I said anything mean about her.' Zann said she noticed the tweet that night and messaged Scissons to ask him to take it down. Twit on twitter: Nick Scissons said he deleted the naked image of Lenore Zann from his Twitter feed after she phoned his father at home to complain, however he continued to tweet obscenities at her because he felt frustrated . Number 1 dummy: The 17-year-old teenager, Nick Scisson, was told my his mom, Susan McCarron, that it was a dumb move to tweet the picture of Lenore online . 'Luckily the old Lenore Zann got in shape so she can kick some political butt! Please remove this photo,' she tweeted. But the Scissons refused, and an online conversation soon included others who began retweeting the image and began hurling insults at her. On Twitter she wrote: 'Perhaps you've missed the new federal legislation' and 'Distribution of this image falls under the Criminal Code. It has been reported.' Scissons replied, arguing the photo was public on the internet. During the exchange, which lasted around three hours, Zann said she felt increasingly picked on. 'I never signed on for having that image used for another purpose,' she said in an interview. 'I signed a contract ... for my image only to be used in 'The L Word' show. It's not just the image of the picture that was disturbing. It was the way that these people ... suddenly targeted me. It increased in velocity and intent. It was constant and it was harassing.' I was being cyberbullied so I felt that I needed to call the police. The police suggested that I call the CyberScan unit as well and that's what they're there for. That's why we legislated them, so that they'd be there to help people who feel that they are being bullied by other people online,' she said. 'It was Twitter where I was being tweeted at. I was being sworn at. They were swearing at me. They were disrespectful. It was constant. It was harassment and it was frightening. I was afraid. So that for me accounts for my feeling that I was being bullied. And because it's online, that’s cyberbullying.' The actor-cum-politician said she got in touch with the original tweeter's parents, and the principal at his college. Previous career: Lenore Zann (left), a Canadian politician from Nova Scotia who acted in an a TV series and appeared in lesbian shower scene at a women's prison has claimed she was 'cyberbullied' after the image was tweeted online . Ms. Zann's exchange about the incident on Twitter: She tried to bring the full force of the law upon the teenager but the federal cyber-bullying legislation, introduced in November has yet to become law . Case dismissed: Lenore Zann has employed a new law to launch an investigation against a teenager she alleges was cyberbullying her on Twitter . Scissons said he deleted the naked image of Zann from his Twitter feed after Zann phoned his father at home to complain. His mother, Susan McCarron, said she was angry. 'It was like, 'Take the photo down. Period.' And he responded, 'It's down.' That was around suppertime on Saturday,' said Mrs McCarron. McCarron said she told her son it was a dumb move. 'I think it was done without considering consequences and I think it was a poor decision,' she said. Scissons agreed, but both mother and son said the complaint to the cyberbullying unit went too far. 'I can see why she was angry, but I think this is an over-escalation of the situation and I'd like to see it end,' Mrs McCarron said. The former actress also summoned the local school board, Truro police and Nova Scotia's new cyberbullying investigation unit, known as CyberScan. Teen twit: Nick Scissons, 17, sent a screen capture from the L Word showing Zann's exposed breasts . Truro police Chief David McNeil said an investigation last week determined the case was not a criminal matter. 'Since then, our file has been concluded,' he said. They have since closed their investigation without finding any criminal wrongdoing. A spokesman for Nova Scotia's Justice Department said the CyberScan unit does not discuss details of individual cases. The unit was set up earlier this year when Nova Scotia introduced the Cyber-safety Act, which the province describes as the first law in Canada aimed at protecting the victims of cyberbullying and making those responsible accountable under the law. The act defines cyberbullying as any electronic communication 'that is intended or ought reasonably be expected to cause fear, intimidation, humiliation, distress or other damage or harm to another person's health, emotional well-being, self-esteem or reputation.' Excuse: Nick Scissons said, 'It was just meant to be funny and got out of hand I guess. She was on that show voluntarily and she knew that image was out there and I don't think I said anything mean about her.' The CBC reported that Scissons, the teenager from Truro, said he sent the tweet, thought it was nothing more than a joke and the issue was blown out of proportion. However, Ms. Zann insisted that subsequent tweets from Scissons and others were filled with nasty taunts and vulgar insults. 'It was becoming more and more like a pack mentality,' she said. 'They were attacking me.' Ms. Zann said the image was eventually deleted after she spoke with the boy's father and school officials. No sympathy for 'bullied' politician: Despite Lenore Zann telling the parents of the boy who tweeted her, informing the police and even tell his school about his actions, there will be no penalties or prosecutions for Nick Scissons . Wayne MacKay, a law professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax and an expert on cyberbullying, said Ms Zann's complaint appears to meet the act's definition of cyberbullying. He said even if the sender intended the message to be a joke, the law states that an offence has been committed if the accused ought to have known their actions would cause harm. 'It's not about whether you absolutely intended to do it,' MacKay said. 'It's really looking more at what's the impact on the victim. ... The fact that you didn't really intend to be malicious is not necessarily a form of defence.' Professor MacKay said just because an image is in the public domain, that doesn't mean it can be used for any purpose.","Before moving into politics, Lenore Zann was an actress and once appeared topless in Showtimes,The L Word .

"Even though she was 19 and he was 45, sultry Lauren Bacall and gritty Humphrey Bogart were meant for each other. But they were meant for others too. Throughout their marriage Bogie carried on an affair with a Mexican starlet turned secretary. And Bacall - known as Betty to their pals - fell madly in love with Frank Sinatra and began a steamy relationship with him while Bogie was on his death bed with throat cancer. Bacall, who died at her home in Los Angeles on Tuesday of a stroke, fell in with a fast crowd when she wed Bogart. ‘I knew everybody because I was married to Bogie, and that 25-year difference was the most fantastic thing for me to have in my life,' she said. The most famous actors, writers, artists were now in her inner circle because of they sought out her husband. Scroll down for video . Ring a ding ding: Lauren Bacall began her tumultuous affair with Frank Sinatra when Humphrey Bogart was dying of cancer. They went public with their romance after Bogie died . Threesome: Did Bogie know that his wife was destined to sleep with his close friend? Bacall says that Bogie knew how much she loved to spend time with Sinatra - and that Sinatra was in love with her . Bogie and Bacall formed a group they called the Holmby Hills Rat Pack – a branch of the famed Las Vegas tribe, named after the neighborhood bordering Beverly Hills and Bel Air. It was a tight inner circle of stars dedicated to drinking, laughing and partying into the wee hours. Sinatra was pack master; Judy Garland, first vice-president; Sid Luft, Judy’s husband, the cage master; superagent Irving ‘Swifty’ Lazar was recording secretary; novelist Nathaniel Benchley, historian; and Bacall, den mother. They were constantly together. Once, after a New Year’s party in Palm Springs, Bacall, known as ‘Betty’, wanted she and Bogie to stay and hang out with Frank, since the blue-eyed crooner did not have a woman with him that night. Bogie insisted they go home and told her, ’You must always remember we have a life of our own that has nothing to do with Frank. He chose to live the way he’s living – alone. It’s too bad if he’s lonely, but that’s his choice. We have our road to travel, never forget that – we can’t live his life’, writes biographer Kitty Kelley. When Bogie learned he had throat cancer in February 1956, the diagnosis, surgery and radiation came too late and one of Hollywood’s biggest stars was told he had less than a year to live. Sinatra, came to visit him frequently, kept him laughing by recounting the practical jokes going on with the other Rat Pack members. Out and about: Betty and Frank were seen together at restaurants, premieres, dinner parties and weekends in Palm Springs. She was deeply in love and wanted to marry him . ‘It wasn’t easy for him,’ Kelley quotes Bacall. ‘I don’t think he could bear to see Bogie that way or bear to face the possibility of his death. Yet he cheered Bogie up when he was with him – made him laugh – kept the ring-a-ding act in high gear for him’. Sinatra worshipped Bogart but there was also something brewing between the singer and Bacall. They were falling in love while Bogie was dying of cancer. By October, eight months later, to celebrate Bacall’s thirty-second birthday, Frank sent a chartered plane to Los Angeles to fly some of their closest friends to the Sands in Vegas where he was playing at the time. Bogie chose to stay in Los Angeles and spend it with his son. ‘He was somewhat jealous of Frank’, Bacall admitted. ‘Partly because he knew I loved being with him, partly because he thought Frank was in love with me, and partly because our physical life together, which had always ranked high, had less than flourished with his illness’. ‘This was the closest Bacall ever came to admitting her passion for Frank during the time that her husband was dying,' writes Kelley. ‘It was no secret to any of us’, said playwright Ketti Frings. ‘Everybody knew about Betty and Frank. We just hoped Bogie wouldn’t find out. That would have been more killing than throat cancer’. When Bogart died in January 1957, Frank was performing at the Copa nightclub in New York. He cancelled his appearances but did not fly to the West Coast for the funeral of the man he had adored. ‘He pleaded laryngitis, but close friends suspected that he had developed a crippling case of ‘the guilt germs’. Soon their love affair was out in the open and Betty and Frank were seen about town, at premieres, dinner parties and weekends in Palm Springs. Smooth sailing: Until Bogart was diagnosed with lung cancer in February 1956 the couple were deliriously happy.  Bacall admitted that they had a great sex life until he got sick . Mistress: Verita Bouvair Thompson, who traveled with Bogart as his personal secretary, bartender and hairdresser, held two of Bogie's secrets - he wore a toupee.  She was his mistress for seventeen years and wrote about their love story in her 1982 book Bogie and Me . ‘It seemed to everyone --- to his friends, to mine – that we were crazy about each other, that we were a great pair; that it wouldn’t last; that Frank would never be able to remain constantly devoted, monogamous – yet that maybe with me, he would’, Betty said. What followed was months of an ‘erratic’ courtship with Frank - wildly attentive one minute and distant the next. He didn’t want any woman telling him what to do and Bacall admitted she wasn’t one to mildly suggest anything. She was deeply in love with the crooner and wanted to marry him. On the evening of March 11, 1958, fourteen months after her husband’s death, Frank proposed. They celebrated by going to the Imperial Gardens restaurant on Sunset Boulevard with agent and friend, Swifty Lazar. When a young girl approached the table asking for autographs, Sinatra urged her to sign ‘Betty Sinatra’. He was off to a gig in Miami the next day and Bacall went to the theatre with Lazar where a newspaper columnist asked her about an impending marriage. She admitted the truth and by the next morning, the world knew when the morning paper’s early edition headlines read: SINATRA TO MARRY BACALL. That was the death knell for the relationship. Sinatra was livid when she phoned him in Miami. When he finally returned her call days later, he said he was besieged with reporters and couldn’t leave his hotel room. That was the last time Bacall heard from Sinatra. ‘He didn’t speak to her again for six years, and then only in rage’. When asked about the marriage, his only reply was ‘Marriage? What for? Just so I’d have to go home earlier every night? Nuts!’ When actress Ava Gardner, Sinatra's first wife, called him from Spain, he told her, ‘Jesus. I was never going to marry that pushy female’. Bacall’s response to the too-brief engagement was to call him ‘a s***’ and suggest she was so insecure at the time it was pathetic. For years, Bacall never escaped the perception of the great love affair between her and Humphrey Bogart even when she married her second husband, Jason Robards. Bust up: When Betty spilled the beans that the crooner had proposed to a newspaper and it splashed a headline on the front page, Sinatra was incensed. They split soon after and Frank didn't speak to Bacall for six years . She also never escaped the revelation that Bogart had a mistress throughout their marriage. Verita Bouvair Thompson, who traveled with Bogart as his personal secretary, bartender and hairdresser, held two of Bogie’s secrets – he wore a toupee and she was his mistress for seventeen years. The Mexican starlet met Bogart at an after party for Casablanca in 1942, two years before he met Bacall. Thompson had established herself in Hollywood as an expert on toupees, preparing hairpieces for George Raft, Ray Milland and Gary Cooper – as well as Bogart. Bogie didn’t like to dance, but honey, we danced the night away and from that day on we were lovers’, she stated. 'It’s hard for people to accept that Bogie and Bacall myth wasn’t really what it was’, according to Dean Shapiro, a writer and Thompson’s boyfriend. ‘They were supposed to be this great Hollywood couple, but Bogie was carrying on with Verita on the side. They did a lot of crazy things together’. Bacall had a secret of her own when she came to Hollywood. She was a nice Jewish girl but concealed it. ‘There was anti-Semitism in Hollywood and I was terribly frightened. I was nineteen and wasn’t exactly swimming in self confidence. It’s one area of my life I am not proud of’. When she fell in love with Bogart, she made sure he knew but then he was the last man on earth who would have cared. Bacall lived her life out at a luxurious, cavernous apartment on a high floor of the Dakota, the grand residential building overlooking Central Park on Manhattan’s Upper West side where John Lennon was living when he was shot down by David Chapman in 1980. She often ventured out always wearing all black, a black shirt, black pants and black orthopedic shoes – always accompanied by her ‘friend’, her aluminum walker with tennis balls on its feet.Still outspoken and feisty in her final years. After Bacall’s marriage to Jason Robards broke down because of his drinking, she was linked with James Garner, the ruggedly handsome star of Rockford Files, during his second separation from his wife in 1979. Garner died just a month before Bacall.","Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart and Frank Sinatra were close pals, part of the 'Holmby Hills Rat Pack'

"Charged: Alison Ernst, 36, has been charged with disorderly conduct after throwing a shoe at the former Secretary of State . A woman has been charged and taken into custody after throwing what she described as a shoe at Hillary Clinton during a Las Vegas speech. Police identified Alison Ernst as the woman who tried to harm the former Secretary of State at an event on Thursday. The 36-year-old made her way up to the stage at the Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino where Clinton was addressing a crowd at a Scrap Recycling Industries meeting. The Las Vegas Review Journal reported that Ernst threw the show overhand before being taken away by security. She also threw a stack of papers in the air and a spectator who said it appeared to be a confidential Defense Department report from 1967 that detailed an operation called 'Cynthia' that took place in Bolivia. Ernst, whose mugshot shows has short brown hair, was pictured being escorted away while wearing a long platinum blonde wig and a figure-hugging blue and black dress. Clinton ducked but did not appear to be hit by the object, and then joked about the incident. 'Is that somebody throwing something at me?' Clinton asked. 'Is that part of Cirque du Soleil?' Later reports revealed that Ernst had a single shoe in her purse when she went into the event but security guards did not get a chance to ask her about it beforehand because she avoided the security checkpoints. This is not Ernst's first run in with the law, and she appears to have a history of causing scenes around controversial figures. Scroll down for video . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ducks after a shoe was thrown at her while she was delivering remarks at the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries conference . Chucked: Clinton joked that the assailant must not have played softball like she did since the shoe missed . Radar Online reports that Ernst, who is from Phoenix, is the same Allison Michelle Ernst who showed up at a court hearing for Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes and started screaming. In the August 2012 incident, she screamed at Holmes before being escorted out. 'I tried to deliver information vital to the defense of James Holmes to the public defender,' she said at the time. She later filed a preliminary injunction for a restraining order against Holmes because she accused him of 'entering my mind though subliminal messaging and causing me to be obsessed with him on  a daily basis'. 'I sleep, eat, and think James Holmes 24/7 and I seek a restraining order to have this James Holmes mind manipulation to stop,' she wrote in the injunction. 'I watched Inception, so I’m fully aware of James Holmes magical powers... James enters my head like Dennis Quaid in inner space and he zooms my heart and plays with it and forces me to care for him. 'Holmes won’t even look at me (in court)... this offends me, my life and skin. James Holmes is being framed. 'They wanted to Tim McVay [sic] him...Much like James Holmes, [McVeigh] was a mind-controlled patsy that they dumped the blame for the bombing on,' she wrote, referencing the Oklahoma City bomber. In disguise: Ernst is seen wearing a platinum blonde wig as she is escorted out of the event by security . Though she said she was ignored by her target when it came to the Holmes hearing, that wasn't the case when she had her Thursday outburst at the Clinton event. 'My . goodness, I didn't know that solid waste management was so . controversial,' Clinton said. 'Thank goodness she didn't play softball . like I did.' Many in the audience of more than 1,000 people in a large ballroom laughed and applauded as Clinton resumed her speech. Brian . Spellacy, U.S. Secret Service supervisory special agent in Las Vegas, . said the woman was being questioned and would face criminal charges. Las . Vegas police later announced that Ernst now faces one count of . disorderly conduct and has been released from custody. Her court date is . set for June 24. A black and orange shoe was recovered from the stage, Spellacy said. Ilene Rosen, the wife of a conventioneer from Denver who was seated in the second row, said she saw an orange object fly toward the stage from a side aisle and papers fluttering in the air. Security: An agent enters the stage to assist the expected Democratic presidential nominee . Rosen said the woman had walked down . the aisle to within six rows of the front of the seating area, threw the . items, turned around, put her hands in the air and walked toward the . back of the room. Security officers quickly caught up with her. In the hotel hallway, the middle-aged . blonde woman sat calmly on a sofa, wearing a blue dress and thong . sandals. She said she threw a shoe and dropped some papers, but didn't . identify herself to reporters or explain the action. Security officials . then ushered reporters and photographers away. Spellacy . and Mark Carpenter, spokesman for the recycling institute, said the . woman wasn't a credentialed convention member and wasn't supposed to . have been in the ballroom. After her speech, Clinton answered questions posed by Jerry Simms, the outgoing chairman of the organization. Simms first offered what he called a 'deepest apology for that crude interruption.' Clinton answered questions broadly, saying she felt politics today leads people to 'do what they think will be rewarded.' An attendee later handed a reporter a piece of paper that was apparently thrown by the woman. It appeared to be a copy of a Department of Defense document labeled confidential and dated August 1967; it referred to an operation 'Cynthia' in Bolivia. Who threw that?

"A new book has lifted the lid on the womanizing ways of Bob Hope, claiming the stage and screen veteran 'often cheated' during his 69-year marriage and enjoyed numerous flings with with iconic actresses like Doris Day and Lucille Ball. The biography, Hope: Entertainer of the Century, by Richard Zoglin, details the many one-night stands and even relationships he carried on with his outside of his union to Dolores Reade Hope, who he married in 1934. The book claims the couple were never officially married, despite there assertions, and there is no proof they ever walked down the aisle, according to The New York Post. But perhaps the most shocking revelation was an affair Hope reportedly had with Rosemarie Frankland, a Welsh beauty queen. Scroll down for video . 'Great love': Of his many supposed affairs, actor and comedian Bob Hope is said to have had a relationship lasting 'almost 30 years' with beauty queen Rosemarie Frankland, who he crowned Miss World in 1961 (pictured) Flashback: American comic and film actor Bob Hope is seen here in 1939 his wife Dolores in London . Admirers: Bob Hope performs for the troops with singer Barbara McNair in 1968 . Hope crowned her Miss World in 1961 and the relationship blossomed - for the next 30 years, the book claims. Hope 'took Frankland on his 1961 Christmas trip to the Arctic, supported her when she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a film career and gave her a small part in his 1965 movie I’ll Take Sweden,’ Zoglin wrote. A former publicist for Hope told the biographer that Hope referred to Frankland 'the great love of his life'. While it is not known what finally caused the two to part ways, Frankland was found dead of a drug overdose in her shabby LA apartment in 2000. Next to her body was an empty bottle of pills and an empty bottle of tequila. Arguably Hope's most high-profile affar was with the incomparable Doris Day. Fling: Hope is said to have had a brief relationship with co-star  Doris Day, but the actress and singer called it off . Comedian Bob Hope (left) and radio singer Doris Day have Santa Claus'on the air together in LA in 1948 . 'Hope claimed to a friend years later that he and Day had a brief romantic fling while they were touring together [raising funds for the March of Dimes, above] in 1949,’ Zoglin writes, The Post reported. 'When they returned home to Burbank, Dolores was at the airport to greet them, giving Bob an ostentatious welcome-home hug. 'According to Hope, Day saw the gesture as a wife’s symbolic marking of her territory, and she ended the relationship then and there. 'Day [now 90] never commented on the alleged affair.’ For several months in 1949, Hope enjoyed an affair with sexpot actress Barbara Payton. 'She followed Hope around the country, moved into a furnished apartment that he rented for her in Hollywood, and when the affair ended in August, was paid off by Hope to keep quiet about it,' Zoglin, quoting Payton's biographer, wrote in his book. 'If so, it didn’t stop Payton . . . from selling her story to Confidential magazine in 1956, a rare breach in the wall of secrecy that surrounded Hope’s sex life.' In the interview she was damning of Hope and his temper, saying: 'Hope was ... at times a mean-spirited individual with the ability to respond with a ruthless vengeance when sufficiently provoked.' Tragic American actress Barbara Payton drank herself to death in 1967 . American film actress Barbara Payton seen in an embrace with her leading man Stephen Murrayfor a scene in British film, The Four Sided Triangle, in 1958 . However, on the back of her failing career, Payton turned to drugs and prostitution. She eventually drank herself to death in 1967, aged 39. Another controversial conquest was writer Sandy Vinger, who Zoglin described as Hope's last girlfriend and companion during the 1980s. In 1994, when Hope was 91, Vinger sued him for breach of contract. She claimed Hope had promised to support her for life. The lawsuit was settled out of court. Hope is also said to have had a four-year relationship with actress Marilyn Maxwell and an affair with his publicist Ursula Halloran. Zoglin claims Hope's wife 'almost certainly' knew of his cheating ways. There were also encounters with Lucille Ball, Jane Russell, Madeleine Carroll, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and Dorothy Lamour, The Post reported.

'We’d go to a hotel, I swear to you, outside his room were three, four, five young, beautiful girls, waiting to be picked by him to come in . . .

Their eldest, Linda, is quoted in the book as saying: 'I’m sure my mother knew what was going on. 'And she just decided that he was worth going through whatever she had to go through, to have the life and be Mrs. Bob Hope.

"Ronald Koeman believes the way Southampton perform in the next two matches against sides fighting for their Premier League status could be crucial in determining how high Saints finish this season. Southampton go to West Brom on Saturday bidding to bounce back from the 2-0 home loss to Liverpool which dented their Champions League dream. The Baggies and next Tuesday's opponents Crystal Palace are five points clear of the relegation zone entering this weekend's fixtures. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman wants his team to be more effective in their upcoming fixtures . Southampton's players fail to block Raheem Sterling's shot as the Liverpool forward scores at St Mary's . And while their ambitions are at different ends of the standings, Koeman knows his fifth-placed side must show their ability and be more efficient against West Brom and Palace. 'We will play a lot for our chances for a high position in the table in the next two games. We have to realise that,' he said. 'We have to be prepared for that. I think we're doing well, if you go back to the game against Liverpool, we played well. 'We deserved much more than we got. Now it's about being more effective. 'That's maybe the question at the moment. We're not effective enough to score and to win games. (But) total feel of the team I am happy.' Tony Pulis has provided added steel to West Brom since being installed as manager, and Koeman is wary. The Dutchman said: 'I have watched two games of theirs the last few weeks. Sadio Mane could start against West Brom after being punished for poor timekeeping against Liverpool . Southampton face Tony Pulis' West Brom at the Hawthorns as they look to get their season back on track . 'It's normal that, as a manager, coming into a new team, you try to sort out the defensive organisation. They have. 'It's not easy to score against them. All the results are very close, not a lot of goals in their games. 'Always the opponent has more ball possession, but it's not always about having ball possession. It's about what you make of that. 'They're very strong in set-pieces, because they have as a team, the highest score of scoring at set-pieces. 'They fight for every point and they play out of the qualities that they have. That's the best you can do as a manager.' Koeman knows league position means little when it comes to the match-ups. Defender Toby Alderweireld could start at the Hawthorns after recovering from a hamstring injury . 'A lot of clubs play not to be relegated or to go in the Europa League or for the Champions League positions,' he said. 'Everyone will fight. My experience after one season in the Premier League is that every game is difficult. 'You can win or lose against anybody. You have to go game by game, in my opinion.' Sadio Mane could start after being punished for his poor timekeeping. The Senegal winger was late ahead of the Liverpool clash and was a substitute.

"Ashley Madison, an online dating service for people in relationships and seek affairs, has unveiled a new billboard featuring Hillary Clinton in Chicago. The billboard includes an image of Clinton holding a finger to her lips, with the caption 'Harder Choices...lead to AshleyMadison.com.' The former Secretary of State has been busy promoting her new book, 'Hard Choices.' Ashley Madison's tagline is 'Life is Short. Have an Affair,' and its website includes a photo of a woman making the same gesture. 'Harder Choices': Extramarital dating service Ashley Madison has made Hillary Clinton the star of its new billboard . MyFoxChicago, which broke the story, notes that this isn't the first time Ashley Madison has used political figures in advertisements - the company created billboards for President's Day and during the 2012 election. The President's Day advertisement from last year included the images of Presidents Roosevelt, Kennedy and Clinton with the slogan 'Who said Cheaters Never Prosper? Happy President's Day!' The 2012 ad featured Mitt Romney, with the words 'If Cheating On Your Taxes Is OK, So Is...Ashley Madison.com.' In a phone interview with MailOnline, . Noel Biderman, CEO of Ashley Madison, said Clinton was chosen for the . billboard because 'this could be the first time a person sitting in the . Oval Office has survived infidelity [from a partner's affair] and has an . understanding of infidelity.' Presidential: Hillary Clinton's husband, President Bill Clinton (far right), was featured in an Ashley Madison billboard . Not the first time around: 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was also featured in an Ashley Madison ad . Biderman said he wasn't sure if the billboard was 'satirical,' but said it was 'a play on words that allows people to interpret and discuss' infidelity.

"For any Italians that harboured ambitions as a child of one day pulling on the famous red strip of Leyton Orient, the dream could be edging closer to reality. The east London club is the subject of a TV show on the continent in which footballers compete against one another to win a professional contract at Brisbane Road. The Leyton Orient Show follows the players as they train at the club's training ground and play in trial games at the stadium. Leyton Orient are the subject of a reality TV show in Italy where players compete for contract at club . The show airs on Italian TV channel Agon on prime time on Thursday nights . Orient owner Francesco Becchetti set up the programme and also owns the Agon Channel in Itlay . The reality show airs on prime time Italian TV on Thursday nights and was the idea of club owner Francesco Becchetti, who also owns the Agon Channel that the programme appears on. 'It's a great success, especially for the amount of people that are watching Leyton Orient,' Becchetti told BBC News. 'People are talking about Leyton Orient. People are talking about this talent show and the opportunity we are giving young Italians to come to London to live this great experience, with regards to both the city and British football.' Italian businessman Becchetti acquired Leyton Orient last summer and had grand plans for the League One club with former owner Barry Hearn declaring that Premier League neighbours West Ham 'should be petrified' of the Italian. Becchetti took ownership of the club after they missed out on promotion to Championship by the narrowest of margins following a penalty shootout defeat by Rotherham in the play-off final. The show follows the players as they train at Orient's training ground and play trial matches at Brisbane Road . Orient are currently bottom of League One after they were beaten in the play-off final last season . Fast-forward nine months and Orient are rock bottom of the third tier but Becchetti does not agree that the reality TV has been a distraction to their campaign. 'I think that it is wrong to think that if they (Leyton Orient) are bottom of the league now there is something wrong with it. The reason they are doing not so well is because we are starting a new era and I think that with all the investment, when you start something new, you have to wait a little bit of time. But with the club fighting relegation supporters are less convinced about the merits of the show. Tom Davies from the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust said: 'As the results have gotten worse I think it is something that people have latched on to as something that sums up where we're going wrong really. People are using the word circus and saying this is a joke club.'","Italian's are competing against each other to win contract at Leyton Orient .

"You've got time: Judge Michael J. Holbrook of Franklin County, Ohio created 'Holbrook holidays' where parolees spend three to five days in jail during Thanksgiving or Christmas to deter recidivism . An Ohio woman who ran a black market business providing illegal immigrants with IDs was sentenced to five years of parole yesterday - with the added condition that she spend at least three days in jail every Christmas. The sentence was handed down to 44-year-old Betina Young by Judge Michael Holbrook who has been giving out these unique holiday sentences - called 'Holbrook holidays' - since he was elected to his position in 2004. Judge Holbrook's bailiff David Petikas told MailOnline that 'Holbrook holidays' give parolees an idea of what real prison time would be like, and who really suffers if they continue their life of crime. 'It's a reminder of who they are letting down and the toll it may take on your family during the holidays,' Petikas said. However, Petikas also said that parolees are offered the opportunity to work hard to complete the conditions of their parole and can be off probation in as little as a year and a half. Young pled guilty in May on five counts of tampering with records. In addition to probation and Holbrook Holidays, Young will have to pay a $3,000 fine. If she skips out on any of her holidays in jail, she will have to spend 15 years in prison. The offenders: Betina Young, left, will have to spend at least three days in jail at Christmas each year as part of her five-year probation term. She worked with Sekou Kpoto, right, to issue over 95 false IDs to illegal immigrants . A former employee of the deputy registrar's office in Gahanna, Young would secretly set up payment plans with illegal immigrants to falsifying their records. Young worked with 42-year-old Sekou Kpoto, who would solicit the bribes from the foreign nationals and transport them to the Gahanna agency where Young worked. In seven years, Young issued 95 fraudulent licenses according to the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles. An investigation by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security found that Kpoto received $700 to $1500 for each false ID, and split a portion with Young. Kpoto himself will face trail next Tuesday, and is also charged with five counts of tampering with records.","Betina Young, 44, was convicted of providing over 95 false IDs to illegal immigrants .

"Mike Catt is just the man to evaluate the hype around Jonathan Joseph and the comparisons being made with Jeremy Guscott, as the long span of his career meant he played with both centres. After England’s man of the moment touched down twice at Twickenham on Saturday, following a try-scoring contribution to the victory in Cardiff, the ‘new Guscott’ tag was being applied with more conviction than ever. Catt, the national team’s attacking skills coach, worked with Joseph during his transition from playing to coaching at London Irish, so he has been aware of his potential for several years. Jonathan Joseph scored two tries for England against Italy and has earned comparisons with Jeremy Guscott . Mike Catt (left) played with Guscott and now works with Joseph due to his  England coaching role . Guscott (left) charges through Ireland's defence to score a try for England at Twickenham . Asked about the comparisons with his former Bath and England accomplice, Catt said: ‘I made them four years ago but he’s a different player. Jerry was more of a swerving outside centre, when there’s a big hole in the 13 channel. ‘There aren’t many holes any more, so JJ’s footwork and his ability to slip out of tackles, like you saw (on Saturday) and last week, is phenomenal. That’s the X factor you need to win games. You know you need the X factor like that to be able to break defences down. ‘But Jerry got 70-odd caps so we’ll see how many JJ gets. He’s got a lot more tries to get, to be fair to Guscott. But three from eight caps is not bad. It’s brilliant to see, it’s refreshing.’ There were many satisfying aspects of England’s six-try demolition of Italy which maintained the fine start to their RBS 6 Nations crusade and a few glaring problems to address. But as the capacity crowd dispersed there was no doubt about the primary subject for excited discussion. Joseph is creating a buzz. He has been the form centre in the country this season and now his stellar form has transferred seamlessly to the Test arena. His tries on Saturday came after he had been shunted out to the wing as part of a reshuffle caused by the early loss of Mike Brown. The 23-year-old’s first try, from turnover ball near halfway, featured a glorious side-step and a turbo-charged burst clear of the covering defenders. His second strike was expertly crafted by George Ford’s delayed pass to send him hurtling through a gap. Joseph (lower) crossed the line twice for England against Italy and has three tries in eight appearances . Jospeh (centre) celebrates with Luther Burrell (left) in England's Six Nations victory against Italy . England attacking skills coach Catt (left) was a World Cup winner in the 2003 tournament in Australia . Catt is delighted to see confirmation of the promise he saw years ago as Joseph shows there is a place in the modern international game for subtle attacking qualities amid the thunder of heavy cavalry. ‘Everybody thinks international rugby is all about size but players who play against Jonathan Joseph don’t want to defend him because he’s lethal,’ he said. ‘He’s a hard man to stop. He has incredible feet. ‘He’s very hard to break down if you get the ball to him early, and that’s where George (Ford) has been phenomenal. George gives him early ball and then he’s able to see what’s in front of him. He just plants guys down and gets round them. He’s never tackled behind the gain line. He always makes an extra two or three metres and that’s crucial when it comes to attack, especially in the 13 channel.’ Joseph’s exploits from the flank against Italy will give the England coaches cause to consider him as a wing option if they ever have their full midfield contingent fit. But he is making a powerful case for a long run in his preferred position at outside centre. The No 13 shirt was seemingly only made to measure for Manu Tuilagi but the Leicester wrecking ball faces a battle to regain his place when he returns from injury. ‘Going into a World Cup you’ve got to have four centres,’ said Catt, a member of the victorious 2003 England team. ‘Having guys like Manu who can break down a defence in a different way to how JJ does is what you want. You’ve got a good balance there — and competition. ‘For Manu to get his place back you’re going to have to see some fireworks. Let’s see how it carries on going. It’s just great to have a consistency again between a centre partnership. We’ll see how they develop. I’m sure they will.’ Catt said there will have to be 'fireworks' from Manu Tuilagi (centre) to regain his place in the England side . Catt also praised the impressive performances of George Ford in England's Six Nations campaign so far . England coach Stuart Lancaster will want to see his side combat the sluggish start made against Italy . England were far too strong for Italy but Lancaster’s tempered reaction to the victory told its own tale of shortcomings which must be addressed. A repeat of Saturday’s sluggish start will be far harder to recover from against Ireland in Dublin in 13 days’ time when the championship’s two unbeaten teams collide. Of the six English tries, the first by Billy Vunipola owed much to a generous interpretation of the footage by the TMO. Joseph’s finishes were sublime, while Ben Youngs was alert enough to pounce with a quick tap penalty from close range when the visitors’ defence had switched off. The other scorers were the recalled Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter, which went some way to justifying their return to the Test fold. Captain Chris Robshaw had a titanic influence as usual — topping the tackle charts as always with 18, while his Harlequins skipper Joe Marler built on his superb autumn campaign with another imposing display. In the second row, George Kruis again belied his inexperience with a forceful contribution and No 8 Vunipola ran amok as the game wore on. England captain Chris Robshaw (right) made the most tackles in the game with Italy and had a huge influence . Danny Cipriani (right) scored a try against Italy to help justify his return to the England test fold . Jonny May (second left) created Cipriani's try but also squandered a three-on-one overlap in the first half . But Lancaster was rightly concerned by a dip in defensive intensity which allowed the Italians to score three tries. In attacking terms, Jonny May created Cipriani’s try but lacked composure when he squandered a three-on-one overlap just before half-time. Such fundamental lapses are not critical in a one-sided encounter but they could be fatal in a World Cup knock-out match. Still, clear room for improvement from a winning position is probably the management’s ultimate scenario at this juncture.","Jonathan Joseph crossed the line twice in England's 47-17 win over Italy .

"A woman buried by tons of sand on a construction site in China was saved because her hard hat created an air pocket that allowed her to breathe. The accident happened in the county of Jinjiang in southeast China's Fujian province when Mingmei Xiong, 34, fell into the sandpit nearly 80 feet deep on the construction site, and had a wall of sand fall on top of her. But thanks to the fact that she had a hard hat on, she was able to survive as it created a pocket of air that allowed her to breathe in the crucial 30 minutes it took for colleagues and firemen to reach her. This is the dramatic moment when rescuers saw 34-year-old Mingmei Xiong at being crushed by tonnes of sand in the construction site in China's Fujian province . Rescuers quickly attached a rope to Xiong as the began digging her out of the sinkhole . Rescuers had to carefully remove tonnes of sand in an effort to widen the hole without causing a fatal collapse . Rescuer Shaiming Liang, 43, said: 'We reached her head but the big problem was that the soft, shifting sand would cover her as fast as we could dig it out. 'It was like the sand did not want to let her go.' When the firemen turned up Xiong had already been trapped in the pit for 30 minutes.\n\nOne fireman was fastened by a rope to go into the pit upside down to remove the sand around Xiong's head while others with shovels kept moving away the sand around the pit. Fire brigade spokesman Chung Pan, 45, said: 'It had to be done with extreme care. The sand was fine and wanted to move in one direction only - down on to the head of the trapped victim. It was very tense, a real race against time before there was another major collapse.' Even though the rescue team has reached Xiong, there is still a risk the sides of the hole will collapse, burying the 34-year-old construction worker alive . Even though the rescue team has reached Xiong, there is still a risk the sides of the hole will collapse, burying the 34-year-old construction worker alive . Eventually, Xiong is helped free from the hole having suffering only minor injures requiring an overnight stay in hospital . While the digger and the fireman on the rope kept her nose and mouth free, other firemen dug a rescue tunnel ten feet long beside the woman to allow her to be pulled free. Co-worker Meng Huang, 31, said: 'She popped out like a cork from a bottle. 'We were so happy. We thought she was a goner.' Xiong was conscious if somewhat shell-shocked after her release, and was taken to hospital where she spent a night under observation before being allowed to go home.","The 34-year-old construction worker is buried by tonnes of sand .

"The Piano Man was once on top, finding glory and fortune as one of the top-selling songwriters worldwide. In luck and love, the entertainer has suffered for the longest time, and over three marriages Billy Joel let a lot slip through his fingers thanks to depression and drink. A new biography comes out this week that, according to Page Six, involved 100 hours of interviews by writer Fred Schruers before Joel exited the project. Scroll down for video . Tops: Billy Joel, who has sold more than 150 million records worldwide, found his love life and career dogged by drinking and depression . In 'Billy Joel: The Definitive Biography,' the singer lays bare his history of suicide attempts, his tumultuous marriages — including one to supermodel Christie Brinkley — and how he's now trying to keep his life together. Joel met his first wife, Elizabeth Weber, in 1970 and was smitten from the start. 'She wasn’t like a lot of the other girls I knew at that time who had taken home ec and cooking classes,' he recounted. 'She was intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind, but could also be seductive.' Joel began a relationship with her, in spite of the fact that Weber was married to Jon Small, the drummer of Joel's short-lived duo Attila, with whom she had a young son named Sean. When Small uncovered the infidelity, Weber split, leaving both him and Joel. While her husband was left alone, it was Joel who took her disappearance the hardest. One day, Joel took a fatal dose of the anesthetic Nembutal and phoned Small to apologize. 'The next thing I remember, I woke up in the hospital and learned that they had pumped my stomach,' he told Schruers. Rough waters: Joel said in the book that he fell in love when he first met Elizabeth Weber, who cheated on her husband Jon Small, with Joel, before leaving both . It was Small who saved Joel's life, rushing to Joel's mother's Long Island home, finding Joel lying on the floor and getting him medical attention. Another suicide attempt ended with Joel checking into a mental health center, where he found himself surrounded by others who were not as lucky. 'The people I was locked up with were never going to be able to overcome their problems, whereas mine were all self-made. I can fix this, I thought.' Weber returned, to Joel this time, not Small, and began to manage the songwriter's career, which began to take off even as he medicated his depression with a steady stream of alcohol. Though friends found Weber controlling and brusque, Joel was enchanted, writing singles such as 'She's Got A Way' and 'She’s Always a Woman' for her. Joel describes the relationship now as a transaction. He says when he debuted 'Just the Way You Are' for her on her birthday, she asked him deadpan 'Do I get the publishing, too?' Inspiration: Weber inspired three singles, but Christie Brinkley, who Joel married in 1985 inspired all of An Innocent Man . Beauty: Brinkley had been featured on three back-to-back Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition covers when she met Joel in St Bart's and went on to star in a number of his music videos . The relationship entangled Weber's brother Frank in the finances as well, and years after she and Joel finally divorced, the songwriter found Frank had siphoned $30million out of his fortune. 'I hooked up with the Borgias!' said Joel. 'What a family to pick.' Shortly after things ended with Weber in 1982, Joel was vacationing and met his second wife during an unreal encounter on the Caribbean island of Saint Bart's. Sitting down at a piano, Joel caught the attention of Elle Macpherson and then-unknown Whitney Houston. Tagging along was their companion, Christie Brinkley. Joel later later said 'I kind of felt like a teenager all over again' when he returned to New York and started dating both Brinkley and Macpherson, the latter actually was a teenager when he met her. Brinkley was asked to star in the music video for Uptown Girl, leading to the pair growing closer together. In 1985, Brinkley and Joel married and he dedicated the album an 'An Innocent Man' to her, though the declaration proved to be questionable in later years of their relationship. Third time: Joel reportedly picked up Katie Lee in a hotel lobby when she was a college student, before the two married in 2004 . Striking: Joel said he took Lee to a performance of his own musical during one of their first dates, though she didn't know who the fading songwriting star was then . Touring constantly to make up for his past financial struggles, Joel became worn down by a life on the road and strained the marriage. One night in 1993, after a concert at Nassau Coliseum, rather than go home to Brinkley, Joel booked a hotel. A band member told Brinkley that Joel was unfaithful that night, a claim Joel denies but one that led to his eventual split with her. 'Christie likes to joke that the end of the marriage spelled the end of my songwriting career,' Joel said, but it became a reality, as the next two decades saw him write and record very little. Instead, he drank and spiraled into depression. He had three car accidents between 2002 and 2004, which he once blamed on 911 and denied the involvement of alcohol. His romantic partner at the time was Katie Lee, who was in college when he flirted with her in the lobby of the Peninsula Hotel. According to an interview in the New York Times, one of their first nights out was to Joel's own Broadway musical, Movin' Out. The two married in 2004, when Lee was 23 and Joel was 55, moving into a $4million penthouse in Tribeca together. While the relationship didn't spur Joel to new songwriting endeavors as it had with his past two wives, but it did eventually unravel just the same. Joel was in and out of rehab, but at Lee's insistence went back on tour, often playing shows with Elton John. Lee herself became a fixture in the art scene. One day Joel saw a photo of her dancing with another man at a gallery showing at Art Basel Miami, though she rebuffs any accusations of an affair. Joel could not handle his jealousy, and Lee seemed uninterested in couples counseling that he suggested. 'I realized, it’s not going to happen,' Joel said, and told her 'We’re over. Just don’t send me messages, don’t leave me cute little phone calls, don’t tease me, don’t f--- with me, just end it.' 'I’m an old man now, a vulnerable man. Don’t do that to an old guy.’ The pair divorced in 2009. It now seems the man once described by music critic Robert Christgau as a 'force of nature and bad taste' has cut back on his time in the spotlight. Though he released an album of classical compositions in 2001 and in spite of still touring arenas, Joel hasn't released studio music for a solid two decades. His drinking and depression have still not been resolved, at least according to the man himself, who in spite of numerous trips to rehab says he still has the occasional drink. He's somewhat humbled from his days of dating supermodels, and is living with a girlfriend, 33 and a former hedge fund manager, but he says he remains a romantic. 'You can have all the money in the world, you can have mansions, you can have properties, you can have yachts, you can have limousines, you can have motorcycles,' he told Schruers. If you don't have love, 'it doesn’t mean a goddamn thing.'","A new book, Billy Joel: The Definitive Biography, written by Fred Schruers, lays out the songwriter's rise to fame and gives details of his crushing lows .

"A female soldier claimed that she made $400 a night at Fort Hood sex parties after being recruited as part of a prostitution ring at the Texas base. The allegations were made in documents relating to court-martial in which a sergeant is accused of attempting to use the service. Master Sergeant Brad Grimes was in military court this week, accused of participating in the prostitution ring set up by another sergeant who has not yet been charged. Charges: A Fort Hood sergeant has been found guilty of conspiracy to solicit a prostitute . The allegations are the latest in a series of claims about sexual harassment and sex-related crimes in the forces. Grimes, a married serviceman who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was found guilty of conspiracy to pay for sex from a Fort Hood private. He was allegedly approached by Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen who offered to arrange a tryst with a young soldier. McQueen, who served as the sexual assault prevention officer, is currently being investigated over claims that he recruited cash-strapped female soldiers for sex parties at the base. The defense attorney for Grimes said there had been no talk of exchanging money for sex and added that his client decided not to go ahead with the meeting, after it was set up at a hotel. 'At the end of the day, Master Sgt Grimes chose to do the right thing and not have sex with that young lady,' Daniel Conway said. 'This is really a case about sex parties and Master Sgt Grimes had nothing to do with that.' A female army private told the court-martial that Grimes paid her $100 to have sex with him at a hotel, YNN reported. Claims: Soldiers walk by the base headquarters at Fort Hood, where a Sergeant has been accused of setting up a prostitute ring . She also testified against McQueen, claiming he recruited her for the prostitution ring. The attorney argued that Grimes had been charged after he rejected a deal to testify against McQueen. In documents seen by the Austin-American Stateman, the allegations against McQueen were made when a young private told officials he had tried to recruit her to have sex with high-ranking soldiers. The unnamed soldier claimed the woman Grimes was accused of meeting had told her she made 'like $400 to $500' at Fort Hood parties, according to the documents. The private also claimed that McQueen 'preys on young females who are in bad financial situations and that he keeps their pictures on his cell phone,' a sworn statement seen by the Statesman said. No formal charges have been made against McQueen. At the conclusion of the court-martial yesterday a military panel found Grimes was found guilty of conspiracy to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery. He was cleared of patronizing a prostitute and committing adultery and has been demoted to a lower rank, KWTX reported. Grimes' attorney distanced the case from the sexual harassment scandals in the forces, saying: 'It has nothing to do with sexual assault.'","Iraq veteran found guilty of attempting to hire prostitute .

"A Midtown New York bar with a 'Wild West theme is being sued by former employees for allegedly encouraging customers to photograph staff members clad in bikinis and kissing, or even secretly recording them. The ex-staffers at Johnny Utah's in New York's Rockefeller Center amended their existing class-action sexual harassment lawsuit against the bar's owners and managers on July 1 with new charges, according to media reports. They include allegations that the titillating images are routinely posted on Twitter, Facebook and its own website by their bosses and customers without their consent. A woman rides the mechanical bull at Johnny Utah's, a bar located in Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan. A group of former employees is suing the bar alleging its owners and managers required them to ride the bull while drunk and make out with their co-workers . A picture posted on Facebook shows female staffers at Johnny Utah's dancing in skimpy clothing as patrons look on . The Manhattan federal court filing also alleges the bar's owners used cellphones and in-house security cameras to record the women, the New York Post reported. The footage includes video of women wrestling in kiddie pools filled with cranberry sauce. The new complaint says Johnny Utah's proprietors then posted images on advertising billboards and to social media sites. Jeanne Christensen, the lawyer representing 23 of the former workers, said she hopes the lawsuit, originally filed June 17, helps end the practice of making such recordings in bars. The suit also says the women are required to drink shots of alcohol and kiss while riding the bar's flagship mechanical bull. The women ride the bull together as music plays and customers encourage them to snog. If the women complain about doing these things, they risk having their hours cut or losing their jobs altogether, the lawsuit alleges. Destiny Frye, one of the plaintiffs, was 19 when she began working at the bar as a hostess. Despite her age, she and others were allegedly ordered to drink before riding the bull. The women say they were also ordered to party with two of the defendants, managers Thomas Casabona and JR Lozado, and their friends. The other defendants include the bar's owners, John Sullivan, who also owns McFadden's bar, and Robert Werhane. The mechanical bull is the bar's trademark attraction. Both women and men hop on to ride it while intoxicated, often wearing little clothing . Riding the mechanical bull was parodied on the Fox Broadcasting company cartoon Family Guy with Peter wearing a bikini top .","Owners and managers at Johnny Utah's allegedly required employees - including underage women - to drink and then ride the 'dangerous mechanical bull' while kissing .

"England prop David Wilson has been ruled out of the RBS 6 Nations tournament due to a neck injury, coach Stuart Lancaster has announced. The 29-year-old Bath tighthead will miss England's remaining four fixtures and will be sidelined for up to three months. Wilson will, however, be back in time for the World Cup training camp. David Wilson has been ruled out of the Six Nations with a neck injury, Stuart Lancaster has confirmed . The Bath prop missed the opening win against Wales at the Millennium Stadium last week . 'David has seen the specialist and will be out for the Six Nations,' Lancaster said. 'He's booked in for an operation tomorrow that will relieve his nerve impingement. He'll be out for 10-12 weeks.' Wilson missed England's tournament opener against Wales - a 21-16 victory at the Millennium Stadium - due to the injury. The nerve problem is similar to the one that has ruled lock Joe Launchbury out of the entire competition. England have been hit with a host of injuries ahead of the Six Nations, with Wilson the ninth member of the squad to suffer a problem leading to a lay-off. Dan Cole replaced Wilson against Wales on Friday night and the tighthead impressed . England have been plagued by injuries this year, with Henry Launchbury also out with a similar injury . While centre Brad Barritt and second row Geoff Parling could both return at some point during the series after both suffering knee ligament injuries, six others have either been ruled out or do not have an expected return date. Fly-half Owen Farrell suffered a left knee ligament injury during Saracens' European Champions Cup defeat at Clermont and is out of the entire Six Nations while number eight Ben Morgan had ankle surgery after being carried off against Saracens last month and is also out, along with Launchberry. Powerful centre Manu Tuilagi is unavailable due to a chronic groin condition he first suffered in October while Kyle Eastmond aggravated a shoulder in the final weekend of European club action and no date has been set for his return. Finally, Northampton flanker Tom Wood injured his ankle against Racing Metro and while he did not require surgery, it is unknown when he will return.","David Wilson missed England's opening Six Nations victory against Wales .

"Ashley Cole has explained why he declined the offer to appear in the book celebrating Arsenal's 'Invicible' season of 2003-04. Cole made a controversial switch to west London rivals Chelsea in 2006 - a move which angered Arsenal's fans, many of whom still refuse to forgive him. The book, released last October, featured interviews with a host of stars from that season, including Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira, but not Cole - who has now explained why. Ashley Cole (second right) celebrates with Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires  and Thierry Henry as Arsenal won the league title at White Hart Lane after a 2-2 draw with Tottenham . Cole celebrates with the Premier League trophy with Sol Campbell, Jens Lehmann and Kolo Toure . Cole said in a series of Tweets that he will never forget his time at Arsenal . Members of the Invincible side Ray Parlour, Lauren, Robert Pires, Sol Campbell, Jens Lehmann and Martin Keown gathered in London for a preview screening of 'Invincibles' documentary on Sky Sports . He said on Twitter: 'People asking why I'm not in the Invincibles book I thought it would be for the best. I didn't think fans would want it. 'But I will never forget my times at Arsenal and the amazing achievements I accomplished there with great people.' The book was written by journalist and life-long Arsenal fan Amy Lawrence. She tracked down and spoke to all members of the squad and management to talk about the unbeaten season. Cole, who was still playing for Chelsea at the time, turned down the chance to be interviewed for the book, and Lawrence thought it was due to the manner of his controversial switch from North to West London. Cole moved to Chelsea from Arsenal on transfer deadline day in 2006 . Arsenal fans made mock £20 notes to wave at Cole when Arsenal played Chelsea as they accused him of moving for money . Cole and Arsenal fans never really made up following his departure in 2006 . Cole was offered a new contract by Arsenal on wages of £55,000 per week, but in his own book, My Defence, the left back said the offer left him ‘trembling with anger’ as he had asked for £60,000 per week and felt the club were not that keen on keeping him if they were prepared to haggle over £5,000 . Cole moved to Chelsea on transfer deadline day with the Blues offering a deal worth £90,000-a-week and the move left a bad taste in the mouth for all concerned. Manager Arsene Wenger described the whole Cole saga as one of the regrets of his career. Cole had been earmarked by Patrick Viera to replace him as Arsenal captain and spend the whole of his career at the club. Wenger says in the book that Cole left due to a misunderstanding between his agent and the club. In an interview with www.the42.ie, Lawrence said: ‘When he left and went to Chelsea, there was a lot of bad feeling on Arsenal’s part and on his part. I don’t think he feels like he was treated well, and obviously Arsenal don’t feel as if they were treated well. It was like a very messy divorce. ‘You’d like to think with a bit of time, he could look back on that period and be proud of it. I’m not sure he’s ready to do that yet — he certainly wasn’t ready while he was a Chelsea player. ‘Perhaps in a few years’ time when his career is over and he has a bit more distance, maybe he can recognise what he achieved. I wouldn’t be convinced it’ll happen, but certainly the players spoke fondly of him and had a lot of affection for him as a person as well as a player. But there’s obviously still a bit of a problem there.’","Ashley Cole declined the chance to be interviewed for the Invincible book .

"The transfer window may have slammed shut after a month of activity, but Premier League clubs will still be in a position to speak to a select group of Europe's elite before the end of the season. There are a raft of players, including Real Madrid's Sami Khedira, Dani Alves of Barcelona, and the Shakhtar Donetsk forward Luiz Adriano, who has scored nine times in the Champions League this season, available to sign ahead of the 2015-16 season on a pre-contract agreement. Sportsmail takes a look at the players who are available on a bosman transfer- firstly in an XI format - and then with a collection of notable others. Sergio Romero (Sampdoria) Interest: Manchester United, Liverpool . The man who saved two Holland penalties in the World Cup semi-final could well be leaving Serie A at the end of this season. Argentina's stopper - who was shortlisted for the Golden Glove award in Brazil - would be very handy for most sides. One wonders whether Brendan Rodgers fancies deploying someone down at Stadio Luigi Ferraris? Sergio Romero was Argentina's goalkeeper during the 2014 World Cup and plays for Serie A's Sampdoria . The 28-year-old dives to his right as he thwarts Wesley Sneijder in the World Cup semi-final shootout . Dani Alves (Barcelona) Interest: Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham . Alves has already made it clear that he won’t be staying at the Nou Camp beyond his current contract and would represent an exciting prospect for almost every side in Europe. A veteran of the Champions League but still with the vibrancy a full back in England requires, the Brazilian will have many suitors. Dani Alves has already made it clear that he won't be staying at Barcelona beyond his current deal . Fabian Schar (FC Basle) Interest: Arsenal . One of the emerging central defenders in Europe and with designs of bigger things. Excellent against Liverpool in the Champions League earlier this season and has plenty of admirers. Only 22 so would require a compensation fee to be paid, but that would come out at less than Basle’s asking price otherwise. Andrea Ranocchia (right), pictured in action for Inter Milan against Sassuolo on Sunday . Andrea Ranocchia (Inter Milan) Interest: Liverpool . He says he'll stay at Inter Milan but Premier League clubs with a space in central defence could do worse than have a chat with Italy international Ranocchia. The tenacious 26-year-old is a regular in Roberto Mancini's defence but might be interested in a fresh start if offered an exciting opportunity elsewhere in Europe. Alvaro Pereira (Sao Paulo) Interest: Tottenham . Uruguay’s chosen left back during the summer World Cup, Pereira was the man to continue playing despite a heavy clash with Raheem Sterling in England’s group stage defeat. Loves to gallop forward. Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira played on despite suffering after a heavy clash with Raheem Sterling in Brazil . The full back (pictured playing for Sao Paulo in October) loves to gallop forward from his defensive station . Sami Khedira (Real Madrid) Interest: Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United . The real standout player available. It’s no secret as to Khedira’s obvious ability - with Arsenal interested in the central midfielder - and, although his wages will undoubtedly be high, not many would pass up the opportunity to add the German. Bayern Munich are however, the favourites to land the 27-year-old. Alberto Aquilani (Fiorentina) Interest: QPR . Aquilani was sold to Fiorentina in the summer of 2012 after three disappointing years at Anfield in which he started only nine Premier League games. But the Italy international is yet to commit to a new deal with the Serie A side, and Premier League suitors could be tempted to track the out-of contract midfielder. Sami Khedira (right) is out of contract in the summer and could seal a move to a Premier League club . Stipe Pletikosa (FC Rostov) At 35, the goalkeeper - with 114 caps for Croatia before retiring from international football - may be looking for one last move before he calls it a day for good. Would surely only act as a No 2, but definitely someone who could act as reliable cover. Nigel De Jong (AC Milan) Looking for that little bit of added steel in midfield? De Jong may well be your man. A fierce competitor and someone who Manchester City have missed a touch this season. Maxi Pereira (Benfica) Bombs forward from right back and one of the more exuberant fliers to watch in Europe. Ignazio Abate (AC Milan) Played in Italy's back four during the World Cup and did so impressively. A good age at 28. Yoann Gourcuff (Lyon) Has never scored enough goals given his position and the quality he has, but would still provide a touch of class to a range of sides. Andre-Pierre Gignac (Marseille) Not keen on signing a new deal, with the striker - linked with Arsenal and Newcastle - seemingly on his way. Yevhen Konoplyanka (Dnipro) Interest: Liverpool, Tottenham . Liverpool failed to sign the winger in the summer because Dnipro dug their heels in, but the Ukrainian side must be regretting that now. Interest is high for the jinking creator and he is certain to leave on a free. It’s a matter of who gets there first. Andre Ayew (Marseille) Interest: Liverpool, West Ham, QPR . Always one who is talked about when a window comes around, and January was no different, with Queens Park Rangers having had a bid rebuffed. Marseille won’t see any value in taking the money and running, so it’ll be interesting to see who courts the Ghanaian livewire. Eduardo Vargas (Napoli, on loan at Queens Park Rangers) Interest: QPR, Arsenal . Is QPR merely a shop window for the Chilean? Perhaps, perhaps not. Harry Redknapp will be well aware Vargas is out of contract and - should Rangers have designs of consolidating in the Premier League, they could do a lot worse than to get this one sorted. The one thing that may work against them is question marks over which division they’ll be in next year. Luiz Adriano (Shakhtar Donetsk) Interest: Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool . Simply put, the striker cannot stop scoring. It’s nine (yes, nine) goals in the Champions League already, including five away at BATE Borisov. He is a late developer and an unknown commodity. Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenahm are all interested. Luiz Adriano on target against Porto in the Champions League - he has scored nine times in Europe's premier competition this season .

"For the second time this month a member of the armed forces assigned to help prevent sexual assaults in the military is under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct. The back-to-back Army and Air Force cases highlight a problem that is drawing increased scrutiny in Congress and expressions of frustration from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Lawmakers said it was time for Hagel to get tough with the military brass. ‘This is sickening. Twice now, in a . matter of as many weeks, we've seen the very people charged with . protecting victims of sexual assault being charged as perpetrators,’ Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said. Under investigation: A soldier assigned to coordinate a sexual assault prevention program at Fort Hood, Texas, pictured, is under investigation for abusive sexual contact . ‘It's an astonishing reminder that . the Pentagon has both a major problem on its hands and a tremendous . amount of work to do to assure victims - who already only report a small . fraction of sexual assaults - that they are changing the culture around . these heinous crimes. 'Secretary Hagel needs to act swiftly . to re-examine sexual assault services across the department to ensure . that these disturbing betrayals of trust are ended,' Murray said. A soldier assigned to coordinate a sexual assault prevention program in Texas is under investigation for 'abusive sexual contact' and has been suspended from his duties, the Army announced Tuesday. The solider is being investigated for among other things forcing a subordinate into prostitution and sexually assaulting two others, according to a Capitol Hill staffer who has been briefed on the case and spoke about it on condition of anonymity, reports KSDK.com. Furious: U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, seen on Tuesday, is said to have reacted angry and disappointed by the latest allegations brought to his attention . The Army said a sergeant first class, . whose name was not released, is being . investigated by the Army Criminal Investigation Command. No charges have . been filed. The investigation comes just one week . after an Air Force officer who headed a sexual assault prevention office . was himself arrested on charges of groping a woman in a parking lot. The back-to-back Army and Air Force . cases highlight a problem that is drawing increased scrutiny in Congress . and expressions of frustration from top Pentagon leaders. Pentagon press secretary George . Little said after Tuesday’s announcement that Defense Secretary Chuck . Hagel is angry and disappointed at 'these troubling allegations and the . breakdown in discipline and standards they imply.' Little said Hagel met with Army . Secretary John McHugh earlier on Tuesday and ordered him to 'fully . investigate this matter rapidly, to discover the extent of these . allegations and to ensure that all of those who might be involved are . dealt with appropriately.' Hagel also is directing all the services . to retrain, recredential, and rescreen all sexual assault prevention . and response personnel and military recruiters, Little said. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of . the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement Tuesday evening . saying his panel is considering a number of measures to counter the . problem, including changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and . will act on them next month. 'Tragically, the depth of the sexual . assault problem in our military was already overwhelmingly clear before . this latest highly disturbing report,' Levin said. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said . she intends to present new comprehensive legislation on Thursday to . reform the military justice system by removing chain-of-command . influence from prosecution of sex abuse crimes. 'To . say this report is disturbing would be a gross understatement,' Gillibrand said. 'For the second time in a week we are seeing someone . who is supposed to be preventing sexual assault being investigated for . committing that very act.' Earlier arrest: Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, an Air Force officer who led the branch's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response unit, was charged last week with groping a woman in a parking lot . House Armed Services Committee . Chairman Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon, R-Calif., said in a statement he was . 'outraged and disgusted by the reports out of Fort Hood.' McKeon, . noting he has a granddaughter in the Army, said he saw 'no meaningful . distinction between complacency or complicity in the military’s latest . failure to uphold their own standards of conduct. 'Nor do I see a distinction between the service member who orchestrated this offense and the chain of command that was either oblivious to or tolerant of criminal behavior. Both are accountable for this appalling breach of trust with their subordinates.' The Army announcement comes as the Pentagon continues to struggle with what it calls a growing epidemic of sexual assaults across the military. In a report last week, the Defense Department estimated that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year, based on survey results. Of those, fewer than 3,400 reported the incident, and nearly 800 of them simply sought help but declined to file formal complaints against their alleged attackers. The military is struggling with a variety of sexual assault scandals, including an ongoing investigation into more than 30 Air Force instructors for assaults on trainees at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. Last week the Air Force’s head of sexual assault prevention was arrested on charges of groping a woman in a Northern Virginia parking lot. A police report said that Air Force Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski was drunk and grabbed a woman’s breast and buttocks. The woman fought him off and called police, the report said. A judge has set a July 18 trial date for Krusinski. Congressional outrage over these incidents and two recent decisions by officers to overturn juries’ guilty verdicts in sexual assault cases has prompted outrage on Capitol Hill. Air Force Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin reversed the conviction of Lt. Col. James Wilkerson, a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy, who was found guilty last year of charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. And Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is holding up the nomination of Air Force Lt. Gen. Susan Helms, tapped to serve as vice commander of the U.S. Space Command, until McCaskill gets more information about Helms’ decision to overturn a jury conviction in a sexual assault case. Members of Congress also met at the White House with senior administration officials to talk about measures to encourage more victims to come forward and ensure that perpetrators face justice.","Army: Unidentified soldier has been suspended during investigation into reports he ran a prostitution ring .

I'm looking for new, high-profile challenges.' With 11 goals, Gignac is currently Ligue 1's joint-top scorer alongside  Lyon forward Alexandre Lacazette.

"Former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry has joined the club's backroom staff in a role apparently focused on youth development. Josh Benson, a player for the Gunners' under 15s side, took to Twitter to reveal that he and his team-mates had been coached by Henry on Thursday afternoon.

Former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry has taken up a coaching role, assisting with the club's youth teams . Arsenal academy player Josh Benson excitedly reveals that he was trained by Henry on Thursday . Henry is best known for his first spell between 1999 and 2007, during which he won two Premier League titles. The second of those came as part of Arsene Wenger's 'Invincibles' who managed to go the entire 2003-2004 campaign unbeaten. Following time with Spanish giants Barcelona and in the twilight of his career, MLS side New York Red Bulls, he returned to Arsenal briefly in 2012 on loan during the American close season. Since announcing his retirement from playing last year, Henry has been working as a television pundit with Sky Sports, but this recent foray into coaching is being mooted as the prelude to a venture into management in the long-run. Indeed, given his entrenched association with Arsenal football club, it is unsurprising that Henry has been earmarked as one of Wenger's potential successors when he finally moves on.

The England No 15 has experienced concussion symptoms since being knocked unconscious in an accidental collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi on Saturday. Brown is not allowed to start gentle exercise until he has been symptom-free for 24 hours. Lancaster is optimistic he will start that six-day return-to-play process on Wednesday. Mike Brown could gradually recommence training on Wednesday but won't be rushed back for England . The England full back was at training but not taking part with his team-mates on Tuesday . Brown has had concussion symptoms since being knocked out in an accidental collision against Italy . But in the light of the uproar surrounding George North’s double concussion and growing concerns around head injuries in rugby, Lancaster says doctors’ orders will be followed to the letter. ‘For me it’s always been the same,’ he said. ‘When I go back to my days as an academy manager you have to do what is right for the player first. 'I don’t think any of the coaches I’ve ever worked with would ever do anything other than put the player at the centre and do what’s right for the player. ‘We are all far more aware and sensible in the sense they (the players) know their careers and their post-rugby careers are just as important as their current career.’ A lengthy delay followed Brown's clash with Andrea Masi on Saturday as he was carefully treated .

"George North  brushed off his three-week lay-off through concussion, saying rugby will always have more risks than ‘table tennis or tiddlywinks’. The 22-year-old Wales winger, who will become the youngest player to win 50 caps when he faces France in Paris on Saturday night, has been sidelined after suffering two head injuries during the defeat by England in the opening fixture of the RBS 6 Nations. His record achievement has crept up amid a cloud of debate about concussion, but the Northampton winger does not bear any grudges about the high-profile incidents. George North (centre) walks out for Wales training ahead of his return from concussion against France . North brushed off his three-week lay-off and compared rugby with table tennis and tiddlywinks . ‘At the end of the day it’s rugby, isn’t it?’ said North. ‘It’s not table tennis or tiddlywinks, it’s a contact sport and you are going to get some bangs. Unfortunately they were all on my chin. ‘It’s nice to be back in the squad and involved again. It has been a few weeks of hard work, ticking the boxes and taking my welfare into account, which is what happened from minute one.’ Criticism was levelled at the team doctors after they failed to notice a second-half collision and subsequently allowed North to stay on the pitch. It sparked debate about the safety of the sport and coach Warren Gatland decided to leave the youngster out of his side to face Scotland. North discovered during a meeting with medical manager Prav Mathema that he suffered a third potential impact, but he was still left feeling frustrated by his omission for the Murrayfield victory.

North suffered concussion in the RBS 6 Nations opener against England at the Millennium Stadium . ‘When you are a player at this level, the greatest honour you can get is to play for your country,’ said North. ‘I was passing all the tests and I was symptom-free. I was up for selection so your initial thoughts when not picked are that you are gutted. ‘The neurologist reckons I had a third blow from falling from 6ft 5in to the deck like a floppy sausage and it wasn’t really worth pushing it. In hindsight it was the right decision, but at the time I was like, “arghh!""’ He will be hoping to vent that frustration through his performance at the Stade de France. Including his three Lions caps, North will become the most junior player to reach the 50-Test mark, eclipsing Australia’s Joe Roff, who reached the milestone when he was 24. A special pair of boots have been commissioned for the occasion and North intends to hang them on the wall alongside those from his first Test in 2010. ‘For me it was never a case of 50 or 100 caps,’ said North. ‘It was always about being in that jersey once, then anything more is a bonus. North has had a special pair of boots commissioned for North's 50th cap in Paris against the French . The adidas boots include the branding '#50 - 28/02/2015', marking the number of caps and the date . ‘I’m obviously super-proud to achieve it and hopefully I can keep my head down and get to my Welsh 50. I kept my first-cap boots, my Lions boots and I’ll probably keep these boots as well. You keep your jerseys, too — hopefully my mum hasn’t thrown any of them out!’ His mother will be among the crowd in Paris  to watch her son. The 17st 2lb speedster has a promising record against Les Bleus — two tries in his two previous appearances — but is not expecting a repeat of 2013, when his father earned himself cult status by running on to the pitch to celebrate North’s 71st-minute try. ‘I’ve ordered tickets for my family but my old man is up the top,’ joked North. ‘My mam and sister are at the front but my dad is in the top right-hand corner. If I score and he manages to get down from there, I’ll be impressed!’ North shares a laugh with his wing partner Liam Williams (left) during Wales training ahead of the game . With or without his father, North will certainly celebrate if he crosses the whitewash. Having scored just one try in his last six Wales appearances, the national coaches are demanding more from the former Scarlet. His club form is much better — 11 tries in 15 appearances this season — and Gatland has told the wideman that he must look for more touches on the ball. ‘It’s obvious to see,’ said North. ‘I’ve been very happy with my club form over the past few weeks but I’ve just not been able to get into my groove for my country. ‘The England game was a step forward from the autumn series and the summer tour for me. I missed the Scotland game but hopefully this will be the next step back on to that track.’ North talks to the press ahead of the game that marks his comeback from concussion . FRANCE: Dulin; Huget, Lamerat, Fofana, Guitoune; Lopez, Parra; Ben Arous, Guirado, Slimani, Taofifenua, Maestri, Dusautoir (capt), Le Roux, Chouly.

"When opportunity knocked Les Ferdinand paid attention. From non-League Southall to the England team and most recently to a desk in his office behind which he sits in his designer knitwear while Queens Park Rangers train. He'd rather be out on the grass, he explains, but this interview is keeping him indoors and, when the director of football picks a route through the mud to pose for a photograph, the temptation for some is too much to resist. 'F***ing hell Les, we've only won one game,' yells Joey Barton, from the midst of a nearby finishing drill, his verbal arrows more accurate than anything from his feet, as usual. Les Ferdinand believes English kids are made to look mediocre but he thinks they just need an opportunity . The former England international wants to bring the Stan Bowles spirit back to Loftus Road . The other players titter and Ferdinand laughs along. The mood is relaxed ahead of Saturday's game at Hull City where Chris Ramsey tries to build on victory at Sunderland, the first away points of a difficult campaign, before they fly to Dubai for a training break. 'In a short space of time, there's been a positive turn,' smiles Ferdinand. 'The reaction has been great. We want to be a Premier League side. We know the figures. We also know the first year up is the hardest. Our focus is on staying in this division and everyone to a man is confident of doing it.' Survival is vital with Financial Fair Play penalties hanging over QPR if they slide into the Football League and a large part of Ferdinand's role is to set down principles to keep the club within its means based around growing their own players. Ferdinand says QPR's Premier League survival is vital for the club and he's confident they can do just that . Ferdinand explains: 'In this country, we'll buy someone from abroad for £20m who has been playing professional football for years and we all go: 'Give him a year to 18 months to settle in'. 'Yet we'll take someone out of the development squad who has never played any senior football in his life and if he's not a world-beater within two games everyone's saying: 'Well, he's no good is he'. 'Why not afford the kid the same opportunity? It's incredible. We're making English players and English coaches appear mediocre and they're not. They're more than that, given the opportunity.' He speaks from experience and with QPR in his blood. Hayes signed him from nearby Southall for £5,000 and sold him a few months later to Queen's Park Rangers for an initial £15,000, plus another £15,000 based on appearances and a 10 per cent sell-on which turned out to be £600,000. Born in Paddington and raised in Ladbroke Grove, he walked by Loftus Road every day on his way to Christopher Wren School, now Phoenix High School in Shepherd's Bush. Ferdinand signed for QPR from non-League Hayes and  established himself as one of the best in the league . The former England international thinks youngsters should be allowed to settle like the foreign imports . 'I wasn't a QPR fan but they were the only team I saw play live when I was a kid,' said Ferdinand. 'My cousin's husband brought me to a game against Leicester when I was 11 and Phil Parkes saved a penalty. 'The thing I was most impressed about was that he played in goal with bare hands. I stood behind the goal thinking: 'Woah, this geezer's got no gloves on, man' and I ended up playing in goal at school for three years because of that. 'With players like Stan Bowles and Rodney Marsh, they were always associated with entertaining football. Terry Venables went in and got them promoted and the plastic pitch was in full swing when I joined. There was none of this 3G and 4G, there were no 'G's involved at all.' The former England striker revealed he used to play in goal as a youngster after watching Phil Parkes . He lost 4-1 at Coventry, but Cyrille Regis left a big impression. 'He'd come from non-league like me,' said Ferdinand. 'He looked so massive and strong and had this aura. I was thinking: How do I get to that?' His second appearance was worse – a 7-1 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday – before he returned from a year on loan at Besiktas to established himself in a team managed by Gerry Francis. They were the top London club in 1993, finishing fifth in the inaugural Premier League. 'QPR went out and bought well from the lower divisions and made players better,' said Ferdinand. 'Players came through the ranks, like Kevin Gallen, Bradley Allen and Danny Dichio. People moaned that we sold our best players, but we couldn't compete for multi-million pound players. 'I came when it was acceptable for QPR to go and spend £30,000 on a non-league player but clubs have stopped doing it. The demands are such that if you're not spending £10million on players in every transfer window, you're not competing and lack ambition. His goalscoring record at QPR was impressive after 80 goals in just 163 appearances for the London club . Newcastle United signed him from QPR for £6million and he was extremely prolific at St James' Park . 'It's about educating. We weren't buying players for £3million back then. We were selling for that money and for a club like QPR this has to be the avenue.' Years of boardroom instability and managerial chaos seem to have left the club with an identity crisis which Ferdinand will address with the backing of owner Tony Fernandes. 'I will look at the long-term future of the club,' said the director of football. 'And we will make sure it works. My job is not to sign players. It's to work with all areas of management to improve the club.' At the heart is youth development and opening pathways to the first-team. 'I'm not saying our first-team is going to be full of 21-year-olds,' he said. 'You need experienced heads. When I came here I had the likes of Ray Wilkins and Nigel Spackman to help me. Gerry Francis and Ferdinand after his move to Tottenham Hotspur from Newcastle in 1998 . 'But we need to attract youngsters here by giving them the opportunity in the first-team. That has to be our selling point. With respect, if you go to Chelsea and some of the bigger clubs, you're not getting a chance to play in the first-team unless you're the most exceptional of the exceptional.' Ferdinand and Ramsey were previously employed at Tottenham as part of a coaching team responsible for nurturing Harry Kane, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb. 'All of a sudden the conveyer belt has started,' he said, and the desire to strengthen the same Spurs connection at Loftus Road prompted Ferdinand to recommend Tim Sherwood for the job when Harry Redknapp quit. Tim Sherwood (centre) was recommended for the Hoops post by Ferdinand, but he opted for Aston Villa . 'It is my remit is to bring people in who will progress the club,' said Ferdinand. 'We'd done well at Tottenham and I know what he does. We're good friends but I can't afford to bring someone in here because he's my mate. 'He's a very good manager but he opted for Villa before we really had a chance to sit down and talk and the way things happened we had to act quickly. Anyone coming in from outside was going to be a gamble. 'And, as the owner has said, the job is Chris's to lose. I know what he's capable of. He's been doing it forever, but he's never had the opportunity.' This is Chris Ramsey's first managerial position and has the tough task of saving QPR from relegation .","Les Ferdinand wants the Stan Bowles spirit back to Queens Park Rangers .

"The FEI has reacted to the Al Reef Cup scandal and removed the two remaining international endurance events due to be held in the United Arab Emirates from the calendar following a string of serious issues  during races in the region. Three horses were reported dead at the 74-mile Al Reef Cup in Abu Dhabi on February 1 and one, Splitters Creek Bundy, appeared to have broken both front legs. The decision to cancel the March events, according to the governing body, is 'an emergency measure to protect horse welfare and to preserve the integrity of the FEI rules and regulations at FEI events.' It was at the Al Reef Cup that Splitters Creek Bundy's front legs appeared to collapse beneath him . Click here to read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's column from October 2013: Sport is not about driving horses to their deaths . 'The move follows a mandate from the FEI bureau to the executive board to urgently investigate horse welfare issues and non-compliance with FEI rules and regulations in the UAE,' a spokesman said. The board is now due to finalise its recommendations to the bureau. 'We have made this our top priority and will make our conclusions as speedily as possible so that the recommendations can be presented to the bureau for urgent consideration,' FEI president Ingmar De Vos said. The FEI had initially said the Abu Dhabi event was outside its jurisdiction as it was covered by officials from the UAE. The international races in March were scheduled at Bou Thib, Abu Dhabi and the Crown Prince Cup in Dubai. The FEI are also set to look into the practice of duct-taping over blinkers so that the horse can hardly see. The reason for taping the blinkers is unclear although as it stands, this is not against the rules. In the clip below, also from the Al Reef Cup, a horse with blinkers taped can be see crashing into a gate.","Three horses were reported dead at the Al Reef Cup earlier this month .

"The Conca d’Oro - the Golden Basin - sounds like something hidden and precious. It is. This is a part of Tuscany, deep in the Chianti region, that not even Tuscany insiders know about. It’s a place you might stumble across, if you were lost. I should know. Although it’s only a 60-mile drive from Pisa, I got lost and did not have a sat-nav, so it was well after midnight before I finally collapsed in my bed in the Villa Barone. The Villa Barone is just outside the village of Panzano; and Panzano is where you head to discover the Conca d’Oro. A hilltop haven: The little village of Panzano neatly encapsulates the beauty of the region . After breakfast, we strolled into the village. Below, the gentle hills and valleys of the Conca dozed away the summer. The bakery and cafe were doing steady business. Panzano has a population of 979, not many of whom were in evidence. A couple of older citizens sat on a bench and discussed life. There was not much traffic other than the occasional farmer’s van or another visibly lost hire car. But in the distance there was a sound that was distinctly at odds with these tranquil, timeless surroundings. We walked towards the cacophony. Here, in the land of cantatas and madrigals, someone was playing the Aussie rockers AC/DC at full blast - in a butcher’s shop. People, some of them with wine glasses in hand, were spilling onto the pavement. Inside, the place was packed with a crowd laughing and drinking. It was not like any other butcher’s shop I’d ever known. But then it belongs to Dario Cecchini: possibly the world’s only celebrity butcher. Fragrantly fertile: The fields and slopes of Chianti swarm with vineyards . Dario looks a bit like Jack Nicholson’s jovial Italian cousin. He has demonic eyebrows, a large, hooked nose and burly frame. All the international superstar chefs know him: Alice Waters, Wolfgang Puck, Jamie Oliver. His shop is a place of pilgrimage for those who care about meat. It is also a restaurant. At lunch, under the vines and on long tables, we ate course after course of his succulent beef. There were glasses of majestic Fontodi reds. And the best guide to the Conca d’Oro is the man who makes that wine: Giovanni Manetti. If Dario is a Tuscan Jack Nicholson, Giovanni is an Italian Cary Grant: tanned, beautifully dressed, dryly humorous. After lunch, he drove us around his 80-hectare estate. So what is the Conca? Sculpted into the hills 2,000ft high, it’s a fertile valley once famous for its golden corn - hence the name. Today, the corn has gone and the Conca is a kind of heaven for wine-growers and cheese-makers, as well as butchers, English chefs and AC/DC fans. The south-facing slopes are perfect for Giovanni’s wonderful organic wines. His vines are interspersed with barley to feed his Chianina cows. Their manure nourishes the vines, their milk makes the cheese and their meat ends up in Dario’s big hands. Later that evening, Dario was cranking up the volume and sharpening the knives. The coals in his inferno were white hot and Highway To Hell blasted out of  the speakers. Here in foodie heaven it was going to be a long and hellishly good night. British .

"Apple is turning its retail stores into art galleries featuring the work of photographers and other artists who use iPads, iPhones and Mac computers to create. They include paintings, photographs and short films by both professional and amateur Apple fans. The firm is set to install the artworks in all of its stores in an unprecedented move, saying it hopes to inspire others. Scroll down to see all the artworks and videos . Artwork from artists Craig Redman and Karl Maier is on display on the wall of an Apple Store in New York. The pairs both used iPad Air 2's to create the piece through apps iDraw and waterlogue. The also used FaceTime to chat about the work. 'Every piece in this gallery was created on an Apple product,' Apple said. 'Every brushstroke, every pixel, and every frame of film was brought to life by talented Apple users from around the world. 'As you explore their work, we hope it inspires you to create something new.' Travel photographer Austin Mann told MailOnline he used an iPhone 6 to take otherworldly panoramic photos of an Icelandic glacier. He said it was 'surreal' seeing the artwork blown up in the firm's Soho store in New York. He originally began taking pictures as a way to help review Apple products for a website. He said the larger screen was a major change. 'It's so nice to shoot with a big screen - it's almost like the old medium format cameras,' he said. Mann, who recalls mowing lawns for a summer as a 7th grader to save up for his first, bright green iMac in 1998, says his use of an iPhone and high-end cameras is 'split pretty even' when it comes to professional work. 'In the photography industry especially, when you are getting started you are always seeking gear, 'If I could only get this $1,000 lens,'' he said. Using just an iPhone to take great photos encourages people to 'shift away from focusing on gear and equipment.' Austin Mann told MailOnline he was driving along the Icelandic coast when a bank of fog lifted to reveal the biggest glacier he had ever seen. To reach it and get the shot, Mann left all his gear in the car, put his iPhone 6 Plus in his pocket, and climbed down a steep rock face to capture the  photo in panorama mode. He then used the VSCOCam app to edit the image in the car on his way back to a hotel. Apple commissioned the work of 12 artists at various stages of their career to create works meant to inspire. Showcasing the people who use its technology - in this case, painters, photographers, filmmakers and other visual artists — is a shift for a company long focused on making its products front and center. The artwork, done on iOS devices and Macs using various apps, is displayed on Apple's website as part of an ad campaign called 'Start something new.' And the Cupertino, California-based company is replacing all product signage in its retail stores with the artwork. Just as technology has transformed the way we work and interact with one another, it has also changed the way we create. Jules Julien used iDraw on an iMac to create the modern interpretation on emoji . Jimmy Chin, a professional photographer, used and iPhone 6 and Pixelmator app to capture these stunning mountain scenes . For painter Roz Hall, that's meant shifting away from the canvases and acrylic paint he started out using in art school to an iPhone app called Brushes. After not painting for many years, Hall in 2010 read about a group of artists who started using their iPhones and sometimes iPads, which had just come out. 'I had an iPhone at home and I downloaded the Brushes app,' he says. 'That was a wonderful, simple application.' It was also challenging. When he painted on a canvas, he painted life-size works. Painting on a 3.5 inch-screen was an entirely different thing. 'What I liked about it was that there was no setup,' Hall says. With all the prep work that comes with traditional painting, he says, 'by the time you have everything out the moment has (often) passed.' Roz Hall used the app Procreate to paint with his fingers on the iPad . Brazilian artist Marcelo Gomes shot handfuls of colorful paper from different angles with an iPhone 6 Plus. He slowly moved the camera as a painter might move a brush, while using the Slow Shutter! app to lengthen the exposure time . Hall, whose website lists exhibitions in cities from San Francisco to New York to Shanghai, says he has not painted traditionally for many years. And he prefers painting on the iPad to using a traditional computer. Using the app Procreate to paint with his fingers on the iPad, 'you don't feel like you are fighting a computer to create your art. 'You feel connected to the artwork,' he says. 'When I first used an iPad, it made me think of cave paintings, or when a child first paints using their finger.' While some artists may look at digital painting as 'cheating' — after all, you can delete mistaken brush strokes — Hall, who lives in Britain, thinks it actually makes artists more daring. 'If you spent 50 pounds ($75) on canvas and another 50 pounds on paint, at some point you are going to get careful. You don't want to waste what you spent,' he says. For Apple's display, Hall used Procreate to paint portraits of people he encountered at the university where he lectures.

Taylor-Young bought an iPhone in 2007, when they first came out. Having worked with Polaroid cameras early in his career, he found the quality of the original iPhone's camera very similar. 'It was quite soft and the colors were muted and distorted,' he says. 'The moment I picked up the phone and started taking pictures, it reminded me of photography in its infancy.

"It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. WHAT'S HOT . NIGEL CLOUGH . On receiving a letter of complaint from a Derby County supporter, Clough, the club's manager, drove round to his house. Nigel Clough has guided League One Sheffield United to the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup . Later that year he received correspondence from another fan suggesting his 18-year-old son could get in his team. Clough invited the lad to training and threw him a pair of boots. Lovely tales, both, but they do more than suggest Clough jnr has a flick of his old man about him. They tell you that Clough knows his mind and this is something evident in the way he selects his very best team for cup matches. Hired last season to keep United in League One, he did that but I would imagine his club's fans will treasure the memory of the FA Cup semi-final that followed rather more. A year on and Clough's team have a sniff of Wembley again. United's league form may suffer if they do make it to the Capital One Cup final but Clough will take the risk. Football is supposed to be about guts and glory. Nobody writes letters to football managers to thank them for finishing eighth do they? Clough's Sheffield United go into the second leg  against Tottenham at Bramall Lane a goal down . MIKE BREARLEY . The Australian quick Dennis Lillee used to tell toiling batsman: 'You've got some s**t on the end of your bat'. On seeing the more gullible flip the bat over and examine the bottom, Lillee would add: 'Wrong end mate'. It was crude but it was funny. What was only one of these things was Michael Clarke's welcome to Jimmy Anderson when the Englishman arrived at the crease in Brisbane last winter. 'Get ready for a broken f*****g arm,' grunted the Australian captain. Dennis Lillee of Australia and Pakistan's Javed Miandad clash during a Test match back in 1981 . David Warner and Rohit Sharma exchange words during Australia's clash with India in Melbourne . The Aussies aren't the only exponents of what the modern cricketer ludicrously calls 'mental disintegration'. Typically, they're just better at it than everybody else. The point is, though, that it's not amusing and there is too much of it. The current interpretation of sledging is one step removed from bar room name calling and before long there will be a fight on a first class cricket pitch. Former England captain Brearley – now chairman of the ICC's World Cricket Committee – has asked for the issue to be on the agenda of next week's meeting and he is quite right to do so. Former England cricket captain Mike Brearley, picutred in 1981, has called to stamp out sledging . RAHEEM STERLING . When you can really play, you can play just about anywhere. Back from a break in the Caribbean, Sterling must have wished he was back in his hammock when manager Brendan Rodgers asked him to play centre forward against John Terry and Gary Cahill on Tuesday night. At times during the first half, the little Liverpool forward looked as likely to score as Mario Balotelli, who wasn't even at the ground. Sterling, though, has football intelligence and, like all the good players, he found a way to get it done. His dash towards goal from deep for Liverpool's equaliser resembled a rugby scrum-half spotting a gap from the 20-metre line and was the work of a quick mind. All that Roy Hodgson nonsense about Sterling complaining about tiredness in October sounds like background noise now and it should have been treated as such at the time. Raheem Sterling shoots past Chelsea's Gary Cahill (centre) and Thibaut Courtois (right) to score for Liverpool . WHAT'S NOT . EVERTON . Like the day Tiger Woods drove his car in to a fire hydrant outside his house, sometimes it's not the incident that ultimately transpires to be important but what it reveals. So it is with the curious case of Kevin Mirallas and the stolen penalty kick. Kevin Mirallas missed a penalty as Everton drew 0-0 against West Brom at Goodison Park on Monday . Mirallas (second left) demanded to take the penalty despite Leighton Baines (left) being Everton's regular taker . Three questions: Where was captain Phil Jagielka when Mirallas decided to shove Leighton Baines to the back of the queue? Why did Baines give way so meekly? Why, in essence, did Mirallas feel so confident he could get away with his act of impertinence in the first place? These are the issues that make Everton look as though they have gone soft under Roberto Martinez. A couple of weeks ago, Jagielka gave newspaper interviews claiming media stories about shouting matches in the dressing room were so false they made him laugh. One final question: Everton are four points from the relegation zone. If nobody is shouting, why not? The Belgian dragged his penalty wide of Ben Foster's goal as the game remained goalless just before half-time . Mirallas watches his penalty clip the outside of the post beyond the outstretched arm of Foster . RUUD GULLIT . The clip in which Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal appeared to refer to his opponents as 'Queens Park Raisins' should have been the stand out blooper on Match of the Day. However, he was eclipsed by one of the programme's own as Gullit provided an insight in to what can happen if you don't pay attention. There was a beautiful arrogance about Gullit's football but that doesn't work as an analyst and last weekend he appeared short on preparation. Asked by host Gary Lineker about Paul Lambert, he started to talk about Ricky Lambert. One manages Aston Villa while the other is occasionally a centre forward for Liverpool. Later in the show, Lineker commented: 'Stoke in to the top half' to which his guest replied: 'Could be.' Stoke are, of course, already tenth. Small details perhaps but it's the small details that give a pundit the platform on which he can make broader and bolder statements with credibility. Without these he is nothing. Ruud Gullit appeared short on preparation when the former AC Milan player appeared on Match of the Day . MARTIN KAYMER . Golf can make you so unhappy it's no wonder those who depend on it to feed the kids find ways of pretending that the bad stuff was really quite good. This was Kaymer after his final round in Abu Dhabi last weekend. 'I didn't hit many fairways and I didn't make many putts,' said the German. 'On the other hand I was playing really good golf.' Martin Kaymer was defeated by two over the course of 14 holes at Abu Dhabi last week . Certainly Kaymer's collapse from ten shots clear to defeat by two over the course of 14 holes hints at much more bad than good but the really sad thing about his demise is that the bloke who actually won the thing – World number 357 Gary Stal – is already lost in the story. After all, who remembers the name of the horse who won the Devon Loch Grand National in 1956? Young Stal should be celebrating the greatest day of his young life but the reality is that the 22-year-old is already on his way to becoming little more than an answer to a rather obscure quiz question. *The horse was called ESB, by the way.","Raheem Sterling scored for Liverpool  in the League Cup against Chelsea .

"Many students long to take a break from their studies, and a road trip through America is top of the wish list of Britain's adventure-seeking students, according to new research. A trail-blazing stateside adventure such as driving Route 66 is twice as popular as a safari in Africa and a skydive over New Zealand when it comes to dream holidays. The latest research into student travel habits by gadget insurance provider Endsleigh, has revealed the top YOLO (You Only Live Once) travel experiences amongst students. The allure of the American highway: Many young people dream of a road trip across the United States . With the pressures of student life, it's no wonder that 43 per cent of students want to travel to have a break from work or study, and 73 per cent are planning to do so in the next 12 months. Last August, ABTA released its 'top 10 gap year destinations' based on bookings, none of which included European countries. But Endsleigh's research this year has found that Europe is the most popular continent for backpacking, with 50 per cent of respondents planning such a trip, highlighting a potential new trend in student travel. Wild side: An African safari was also high on the agenda for young travellers . Asia was close behind in popularity, with 47 per cent of students planning to go backpacking to the continent. Individually, Thailand (43 per cent) was the most popular country for backpacking, followed by Italy (33 per cent) and then France (32 per cent), but, out of the top 10 countries, five were European. Aside from backpacking, Europe also proved popular as a holiday destination amongst respondents. Just one of the countries in the top 10 wasn't in Europe - the USA (14 per cent), in fifth place. Endsleigh's research shows that staying connected abroad ranks highly with students, with a sizeable 90 per cent taking smartphones abroad and more than half (51 per cent) admitting it's important to have Wi-Fi access whilst abroad. On a shoestring: Thailand is still the most popular country to go backpacking but Europe takes number one continent . Sixty six per cent of students also admit to updating their Facebook status whilst on holiday or travelling, with 35 per cent doing so several times a week.. Instagram is more widely used abroad than Facebook, with 40 per cent posting to Instagram several times a week whilst away. It seems smartphones alone aren't enough to keep students connected, as 28 per cent of respondents plan to take a tablet abroad and 21 per cent a laptop. Despite being cash-strapped, the average student carries £1,010 of gadgets abroad. 1. Road trip through America - 27% . 2. Safari in Africa - 13% . 3. Skydive over New Zealand - 10% . 4. Stay in the . jungle in a treehouse - 7% . 5. Walk along the Great Wall of China - 6% . 6. Sailing around the Whitsunday Islands in Australia - 6% . 7. Riding the . length of Vietnam on a motorbike - 5% . 8. North Pole Trek - 4% . 9. Hot air . balloon ride over Serengeti - 4% . 10. Mardi Gras in New Orleans - 4% . Sara Newell, Student Markets Manager at Endsleigh, said: 'Our research really shows that students value a good work-life balance. 'Forty three per cent want to travel to have a career or study break, and they are willing to work hard to do so. 'Fifteen per cent of the students we spoke to are even happy to work from home or whilst travelling to fund their trip. 'Phones and gadgets are the some of the most valuable items in your luggage, both in terms of money and of memories, so it's important to take out an insurance policy that sufficiently covers them when you go abroad. 'It's also worth setting up backups like iCloud and Google Drive before you head off to safeguard all your photos and videos if the worst happens. 'Also remember to literally switch off when possible and soak up the new cultures and experiences all around you.'

"Dear West Ham fans, . In my very first column of the season, I wrote that I feared for your team. I was worried that the inconsistencies of the previous campaign, the quality of the performances and the value of the summer signings meant you would flirt with relegation and I predicted you would finish fourth from bottom. After all the stick I got over the years at Upton Park I find it very hard to apologise to any West Ham fan but, I am happy to admit just this once, that I was wrong about your team. Hitting form: West Ham's run of four wins in February saved them from relegation . By Sunday night West Ham will still be in the Premier League and comfortably clear of the relegation zone. I could not see that happening at the start of the season. The club and Sam Allardyce have proved me wrong. Even though his imminent sacking may not come as a surprise, it shows a disappointing lack of loyalty from the West Ham board. What kind of message does it send to a prospective new manager when you ditch a man who has achieved everything asked of him? At times the football has not been pretty but Allardyce masterminded three big wins over Tottenham and a crucial 0-0 draw at Chelsea. That result sent West Ham on a four-match winning streak — their first in seven years — and was the run that saved their season and kept them up. It is admirable Allardyce got the chance to see things through, especially with other clubs sacking managers for fun — the bottom three have had seven between them this season – and he has managed in a bullish manner throughout. On his way: Sam Allardyce is understood to be nearing an exit from Upton Park . They have survived quite comfortably in the end, but there have been problems. Andy Carroll, who Allardyce signed for record money, has scored only twice and his injury saga was a real concern. The away form has barely improved since last season, either. But Sam is a troubleshooter, the kind of man clubs turn to for a quick fix. Now West Ham’s problem of survival has been solved, the fans and the club are ready for a change. Allardyce will feel aggrieved he lost his job over the brand of football rather than results, but all is not lost. Tony Pulis was sacked by Stoke in similar circumstances but has evolved and enhanced his reputation with Crystal Palace. If this is the end for Sam, he can easily do the same thing at another top club. West Ham fans are purists and want their team to play with flair, but we have not seen that for a few generations and any transition will not happen overnight. Out! West Ham fans let their frustration out on the manager after defeat to West Brom . The team are set up for Matt Jarvis and Stewart Downing to find Carroll with crosses. The new boss will have to make the most of the players he has, making tweaks to the way they play rather having a radical overhaul. For all the desire to play more attractive football, sacking Allardyce is a huge gamble. The club will want to be a Premier League side when they move into the Olympic Stadium in 2016 and Sam could have provided that stability. He achieved all that was asked and  usually in business if you meet your objectives, you keep your job. But for West Ham fans football is an entertainment business and they do not feel entertained. It is not a decision that will be taken lightly, but when Allardyce was booed by his own fans, it was the beginning of the end. It was never an easy relationship but now it’s up to the board to find a new man who fits the bill. Fresh new start: A new manager could drive West Ham up the league next season . In the spotlight: Yaya Toure, Age 30, Manchester City . He may not be the most original pick for Spotlight but when Yaya Toure said he did not receive enough recognition earlier this season, I could not agree more. There is a lot of talk at the moment about the development of young English players but any youngster will only take inspiration from what Toure is doing on and off the pitch. He is one of the most humble people I’ve met in football, he is a team player first and foremost and his individual ability is unquestioned. Underrated: Yaya Toure has not received the praise he deserves after another superb season . It is rare to find a player who so perfectly mixes pace, power and technique. He can finish like a forward and defend like a centre half, as he proved for Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League final. If City are struggling to score on Sunday, it will probably be Yaya who pops up with a winner. If he keeps it up I might say he is better than my old team-mate Patrick Vieira. But he’s still got some work to do to match the fantastic Frenchman.","The club and Sam Allardyce have proved me wrong, it shows a disappointing lack of loyalty to sack Sam Allardyce .

"The owner of a hotel in Scotland has turned to social media in the hope of tracking down a young couple who, he claims, left after a luxury Valentine's weekend without paying their bill. Hotelier Jason Henderson took to Facebook to allege that the couple racked up a tab of £800 then left suddenly in a silver Audi. Henderson is offering a two-night stay at the four-star Knock Castle Hotel and Spa in Crieff, Perthshire, to anyone who can help him find the pair using a CCTV image he has shared online. The young couple were captured on CCTV before disappearing, allegedly, without paying for their bill . The mystery couple reportedly splashed out on fine food, flowers and wine - leading to a hefty £800 bill. However, the furious hotel owner alleges they left early without settling up with the front desk. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Travel, Knock Castle owner Jason Henderson said: 'It's disappointing and very upsetting that this has happened, myself and all the staff work so hard to sustain the business. 'To me it's not about the £750, £800, it's about highlighting what these people have done and making sure they don't do it again. It's a matter of principle. 'All we expect is people to pay their way, and I wouldn't like this to happen to anyone, whether they are our rivals in the market or not. 'I have been blown away by the support I have received by people who are all trying to help since I posted on Facebook; it's really pleasing. 'The police here are very effective, and I'm quite confident they will catch the two.' Henderson, who has been running the hotel for seven years and takes on the roles of head chef, general manager and owner, revealed that the couple had enjoyed meals, snacks, champagne and flowers during a three-night stay. He also believes the couple were 'from Scotland' and that they used fake ID when checking in. The 4-star Knock Castle Hotel & Spa, where a case of fraud is being investigated by police after a couple allegedly fled without paying . Hotelier Jason Henderson has offered a free two night stay for anyone who can ID the couple . The Facebook post by Knock Castle claims the couple used 'false' credit card details, leaving it unable to trace the mystery guests. It also claims the couple were driving a silver Audi A3 and posted a CCTV image of them on the property. The woman has long dark hair and is wearing a pink jumper and jeans, while the man appears to be blonde and is wearing a blue zip up jacket and jeans. Police Scotland have confirmed to MailOnline Travel that the matter is being investigated. A spokesperson said: 'We can confirm we are looking into a report of fraud at Knock Castle Hotel and Spa in Crieff. 'The incident occurred between 6.30pm and 9am on February 13/14. 'The man is about 5ft 6ins, of thin build, aged in his late 20s and was wearing a blue jacket. The woman is approximately 5ft 8ins and of medium build. 'Anyone who has any information are urged to call Police Scotland on 101.' The owner of the Knock Castle Hotel & Spa has taken to social networks to identify the couple . The Facebook posts also offers a 'reward' to anyone who help identify the guests. There are already over 100 comments from Facebook users, with one user cheekily suggesting, 'The one on the right [the man] looks like a shapeshifting reptilian', while others question the hotelier's right to post the pair's pictures without their permission. Other users have spoke of their anger at the allegations that the couple left without paying. Paul Kelly wrote: 'Hope you catch them, your hotel looks very nice and people like this deserve to be caught by whatever means possible,' while Jan Thomson added: 'Sorry for your loss. Police will catch up with them for sure. Someone somewhere knows them'. Rhona Murray said: 'Sorry to hear this happened. Hope they are caught.'","Owner of Knock Castle Hotel and Spa in Scotland turns to social media .

"Liverpool have been cleared of any financial fair play breaches by UEFA, but Hull have been fined £145,000. The Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) announced the decisions following a meeting on Friday. UEFA said in a statement: 'The CFCB investigatory chamber announced that Sparta Prague and Liverpool have been found (following the submission of additional financial information) to have satisfied the break-even requirement and are no longer under investigation.' Brendan Rodgers' side will not be hindered to by Financial Fair Play sanctions next season . Liverpool were close to administration before Fenway owners Tom Werner (left) and John Henry (right) arrived . FFP rules are that clubs cannot exceed losses of £35.4million for the 2011/12 season and the following campaign. Liverpool posted a losses of £49.8m in 2012-13 and a further £40.5m in the 10 months that preceded. But the first set of results Liverpool posted are flexible under a term 'transitional relief' and Anfield officials have successfully stated their case to UEFA. It is expected Liverpool will announce a small profit for last season and they expect to post an even greater profit next year, showing how much they have turned their business around. When Fenway Sports Group took over in October 2010, they were close to going into administration but there has been a determination to improve finances. The Anfield club have made serious progress towards improving their financial stability . On the pitch, the Reds were knocked out of the Europa League by Besiktas on penalties . The club have been  aggressive in the last 12 months pursuing new commercial deals; they recently announced a global partnership with Nivea following on from deals with among others, Dunkin Donuts, Garuda Airlines and Subway. Liverpool Chief Executive Ian Ayre said: 'During this review period, the Club was going through a transitional period having just emerged from a difficult financial and operational position under previous ownership. 'Since FSG took over in October 2010, we have stabilised the Club and made good overall progress by taking a measured approach to our financial position as we worked towards FFP compliance. We have always been supportive of the principles of FFP and welcome today's announcement.' Liverpool chief Ian Ayre (right) has 'welcomed' the announcement after coming through transitional period . Hull owner Assem Allam has agreed to pay their £145,000 fine and adhere to FFP regulations next season . Hull, who played in the qualifying rounds of the Europa League, have agreed to settle for the fine and to pay an additional £290,000 if they are not compliant with FFP for the 2015/16 season. Last year Levski Sofia and three Turkish clubs each received a £145,000 - the same sanction that has been imposed on Hull. The CFCB is also expected to announce that investigations into Monaco, Internazionale, Sporting Lisbon and Roma are to continue. Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain were the the biggest loser for breaching FFP regulations last season with both clubs handed £49m fines as well as restrictions on transfer spending and a reduction in Champions League squad size.","UEFA have cleared Liverpool  of beaching financial fair play regulations .

"Golf ball-sized hailstones, destructive winds and torrential rain have battered parts of Brisbane after a rare and dangerous super cell thunderstorm struck the city on Thursday afternoon. More than 82,000 people were left without power after the severe storm, which led to winds of 141 km/h when it struck south-east-Queensland at about 4:45pm, the ABC reports. The wind speed, which is typical of a category two cyclone, led to the uprooting of trees and damage to at least 300 power lines. Queensland Premier Campbell Newman confirmed troops from the army barracks were also called in to help mop up what was described by insurers as a catastrophic event. Although the storms had cleared by about 8:20pm, Queensland police issued a statement on Thursday night warning motorists of expected delays and lane closures on Friday due to the ongoing clean-up of storm damage.

City worker Angela Harper said she and her coworkers were terrified when the windows on their office building started to buckle. 'We are 13 floors up and the whole company was freaking out because there was water leaking in and the windows started to buckle. There were people screaming,' she said. 'I've been through myriad cyclones in Townsville but this was a lot worse and far scarier. I've never experienced anything like it in my life.' Hail stones as big as gold balls were reported, smashing car and building windows . Residents took to social media after the worst of the storm had cleared, sharing images of huge piles of hailstones and uprooted trees . Hail stone as large as 50 cent coins were collected by one Twitter user . Queensland Premier Campbell Newman confirmed troops from the army barracks were also called in to help mop up what was described by insurers as a catastrophic event .

And on Thursday he proved Brendan Rodgers' side chief tormentor once more after playing a key role in their goal to level the tie before almost winning it in the dying moments of normal time when his shot smashed against the crossbar. However, Ba was on hand once more to inflict pain on the English giants as he tucked away a penalty for the hosts in the shootout before Dejan Lovren's miss saw them progress to the next round of the tournament.

"Manuel Pellegrini has admitted Manchester City have the advantage for Sunday's trip to Liverpool after Brendan Rodgers's side landed back from their Europa League trip to Turkey at 4.20am. The Chilean, who takes a fully fit squad to Anfield as they look to close the gap on leaders Chelsea to two points, believes Liverpool's late arrival home from their penalty shootout defeat Besiktas will help their cause. 'I think of course it's an advantage,' he said. 'I also played in the Europa League and when you arrive back on Friday it is not the best way to prepare. Manuel Pellegrini says Liverpool's Europa League exploits gives Man City an advantage for Sunday's clash . Dejan Lovren missed the decisive penalty kick as Liverpool were knocked out of the Europa League . 'You cannot prepare the game because you finish on Thursday night and you must play on Sunday, the players need at least 48 hours to recover.' Pellegrini, however, did say that Liverpool's late night would not be the only reason for a City victory. 'It is an advantage for the other team but it is not a decisive one,' he explained. 'If we think we are going to win that game because Liverpool arrive yesterday (Thursday) night late, that is not the reason. We must play very good because they also have a strong squad. I don’t think they will play the same starting 11.' Pellegrini, who will become back Yaya Toure after he was suspended for Tuesday night's 2-1 Champions League defeat at the hands of Barcelona, is relishing the chance to ramp up the pressure on Chelsea. Sergio Aguero celebrates after scoring against Barcelona on Tuesday in the Champions League . 'It is important, more than psychologically it is important mathematically,' he said. 'We are going to have three points more, we are going to go two points behind Chelsea because they do not play the next game. 'It is very important to beat Liverpool because they are a strong team and a difficult stadium. And to continue winning in the Premier League in the way we did in the last two games because we won 4-1 and 5-0 against Stoke and Newcastle. 'We will continue fighting until the end to retain the title because we have to play for 36 points more.' City have a miserable record at Anfield and have not won there since 2003. It is the only Premier League ground at which they have not tasted victory following the 2008 Abu Dhabi takeover. Pellegrini can call again Yaya Toure again after the midfielder was suspended against Barcelona . Last year, on the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough Disaster, they were defeated 3-2 in a match that handed Liverpool the initiative in a title race they would eventually lose to City. Pellegrini is hoping for a better result this time. 'It was a very special day also because it was the day when we remembered what happened with their fans some years ago,' he said. 'It was a very emotional day. It was a very close game. We couldn’t win for different reasons. This year we go with the same mentality, to try to win and try to be an aggressive team and an attacking team from the beginning.' Pellegrini refused to analyse the recent performances of captain Vincent Kompany, who some believe was at fault for both Barcelona goals. Pellegrini said Vincent Kompany is 'a great player' after refusing t analyse his performance against Barca . Sports data analysts BSports believe the most likely outcome at Anfield will be a Manchester City win . 'I think he is a great player,' he added. Pellegrini also declined to discuss contract talks with defender Martin Demichelis and midfielder James Milner, who has been linked with Liverpool. The trip to Anfield could mean a first start for striker Wilfried Bony, who has come off the bench twice since his £28m switch from Swansea City. 'Bony is working with our team just two weeks,' said Pellegrini. 'We will see which is the best moment for him to start. It is important for him every time that he goes in to give to our team what we know he can do.'","Manchester City travel to Anfield on Sunday to take on Liverpool .

"No football fans like taking a beating at the hands of their local rivals, but Cologne fans suffered more than usual after their defeat by Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday. After Switzerland international Granit Xhaka had scored a last-minute winner for the hosts in the Rhine derby, some Cologne fans decided to storm the pitch. The visiting supporters, dressed in white boiler suits, burst out of the crowd onto the playing surface and then threw flares at the players as they left the field.

Videos taken from the crowd show some of the men being repeatedly punched and kicked as they tried to get back into the stands. After the incident Cologne moved quickly to condemn the fans involved. A club statement read that Cologne were 'disappointed and angered' by the disturbances that 'cause massive harm to Cologne and the majority of Cologne's fans.' Promising 'tough action,' they added: 'Whoever claims to be a Cologne fan and behaves like this does not understand the basic rules of football and is not wanted.'

"The man who allegedly beat to death the 'secret' son of Minnesota Vikings' star Adrian Peterson has a history of domestic violence, it was revealed today. Joseph . Robert Patterson, 27, the mother's boyfriend, was charged on Friday with aggravated assault and aggravated . assault on an infant. The two-year-old boy, named locally as Ty, passed away on Friday at a South Dakota hospital after being . admitted on Wednesday. The football star's father Nelson confirmed that . the boy who died was his grandson. Patterson appeared in court on Friday to be arraigned on the felony charges. Additional charges may be added now that the child has died, South Dakota State’s Attorney's office said. Charged: Joseph Robert Patterson, pictured in court today, left, is charged with aggravated battery of an infant and aggravated assault. It emerged in court that he had previously been charged over domestic violence . Requests for privacy: NFL star Adrian Peterson, pictured at a press conference today, acknowledged   that he was dealing with a 'private matter' but said little else. It is believed that his 'secret' son died today after being beaten by the boyfriend of the child's mother . The little boy was brutally beaten on Wednesday while in Patterson’s home at Platinum Valley Apartments, Sioux Falls where he had recently moved with his mother. Patterson was the sole caregiver at the time. Initially, . police were told that the child had choked on candy. Only later did it . emerge that his brain injuries were the result of being violently shaken. The arrest was made . after police found the little boy with injuries 'consistent with . abuse'. Patterson is being held in Minnehaha County Jail, South Dakota on $750,000 cash bond. He is scheduled to appear in court on October 23 but a grand jury indictment is expected before then. South Dakota State’s Attorney Thomas Wollman filed motions on Friday ordering Patterson to serve two year-long sentences that had been suspended on prior domestic assault charges. Patterson had pleaded guilty in 2012 to simple assault in an incident involving an ex-girlfriend and her three-year-old son. The woman requested a protection order saying that Patterson had spanked her little boy so hard that she had to ice the welts on his buttocks, according to the Argus. She also said that he choked and punched her, threatened her with a knife . and held her in the bedroom against her will, according to records. She asked for the protection orders prior to the birth of the son she has with Patterson. As part of his prior charges, Patterson was ordered to undergo family violence training and to stay . away from the woman until completing it. A different woman requested a protection order against Patterson in 2004 in Jackson County. Remembered: Vanja Srdie shares a memory about Minnesota Vikings' Adrian Peterson's two-year-old son during a candlelight vigil at Sertoma Park in Sioux Falls . Family, friends and well-wishers gather to say goodbye to the little boy who was killed, allegedly by his mother's boyfriend . It is believed that Patterson only recently began a relationship with the mother of the child he allegedly killed. A candlelit vigil was held in Sertoma Park, Sioux Falls to remember the little boy on Friday. One woman told the Argus Leader that Ty 'was a spunky boy full of life, who was ''always running, jumping and into everything... but whose big brown eyes made it hard to be mad at him'. Another attendee, Vanja Srdic, 27, described the two-year-old as 'very happy, very strong-willed, so much potential, a go-getter little boy. His mom was his world'. Following the news of his son's death, NFL star Peterson tweeted: 'Thank you to my family, my fans and fans of other teams for their support. 'The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players. Peterson added: 'God Bless everyone and thank u so much.' Peterson has been . pictured publicly with his son Adrian Jr, who is two, but it was another two-year-old boy who died on Friday. The football star, who also has a ten-year-old daughter Adeja, was spotted in Sioux Falls, South Dakota on Thursday.

Truly unbelievable! #GodBless' A friend of the boy's mother in Sioux Falls told CityPages . that the mother of the child had a casual relationship with the NFL . star when she lived in Twin Cities but had since moved to South . Dakota. A recent paternity . test revealed that Peterson was the little boy's father. The child has . his mothers' last name and the father is not identified on the birth . certificate. Peterson knew that he was the father of the child before he was tragically killed.

"Google Chrome has officially overtaken Microsoft's Internet Explorer as the most popular web browser in the U.S. for the first time, commanding 31.8 percent of the combined desktop and mobile internet market, according to new figures. A report released by Adobe Digital Index (ADI) analyzing the market share of web browsers has shown Google's freeware is up 6 percent year-over-year, trouncing Internet Explorer - once a lone internet leader - which is sitting at 30.9 percent. The figures combine internet usage on both desktop and mobile devices, the latter of which has helped both Google and Apple exponentially thanks to the growing prevalence of phone internet use. Apple’s Safari came in third with a market share of 25 percent, reported CMO.com. Google's Chrome browser has overtaken Microsoft Internet Explorer as the most popular Web interface in the U.S. While Microsoft still maintains a prominent desktop presence (see graph), its lack of market among mobile browsers has seen it pipped by Chrome, which is sitting just in front with 31.8 percent . Mozilla's Firefox browser—which consistently held a minor, yet steady, position—declined from nearly 20% market share two years ago to only 8.7% in April. According to ADI, this decline is likely due to its lack of mobile presence. 'Control of the browser gives Google an even greater role in consumers’ lives,' principal analyst at ADI. Tamara Gaffney, told CMO. 'Not only do the Chrome and Android browsers both default to Google search, but with their Gmail and Google+ extensions, consumers are spending more and more time signed into Google’s ecosystem.' Google Chrome was already a market leader worldwide, with StatCounter estimating its usage at 43 percent. Dominance: Apple's Safari browser has cornered the mobile market thanks to overwhelming popularity of the iPhone . In 2011 Google began to climb in Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Russia, and Italy. However the new data represents such America. ADI technology analyst Tyler White said the results are likely due to the increased reliance of the mobile operating system. Internet Explorer had long held onto its dominance by being the default web browser on desktops. But mobile devices are not relying on Internet Explorer as a web portal, instead defaulting or embedding Chrome or Safari, predominantly. White added that people like to have 'a consistent experience across devices'. Internet Explorer still retains the lead as the go-to web browser in the US with 43.3 percent, but Google Chrome is growing fast, sitting at 30.6 percent . That is, someone is using Safari on their iPhone all day, for example, they are likely to use it at home or at the office when working on a computer. Chrome, which is rumored to become the default browser on all Android devices in the near future, offers a consistent interface with sharable bookmarks in a fully functional browser capable on desktop and mobile, CMO reported. Google has seen even more success outside of the U.S., where it took over the market share lead last year. Google Chrome began its international assault in 2011, when it began to grow in Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Russia, and Italy .","Google Chrome has surpassed Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE) in U.S.

"In the first half of the 20th Century, Montreal, Canada, was known as the sex tourism capital of North America. Now, a new set of archive images reveals the faces behind that seedy . industry. Recently . unearthed mug shots from the Archives de la Ville de Montreal show the . women who were arrested for prostitution and the madams who ran the brothels - commonplace in the Canadian city then known as a place of debauchery. Aside . from their heavily plucked eyebrows, curled hair and rouged lips, one . thing these woman all seem to have in common is a marked air of . mischief. City of sin: The face of Mary Shepperd, who was arrested in connection with an investigation into prostitution, appears in a collection of 1940s mug shots from the Montreal archives. At the time, the Canadian city was a nightlife Mecca and famous for its brothels . Underground industry: Anna Labelle, aka Mrs Emile Beauchamp, was the most powerful madam in Montreal during World War II - then Canada's very own Sin City. Her clients were often the same policemen who arrested her . Perhaps their knowing looks had to do . with the fact that many of the officers who arrested them were crooked . cops who were also their very own clients. In one image, madam Liliane Brown (aka . Ida Katz), who was one of the three most prominent brothel owners in the . era, grins slyly in her black cap and leopard print coat. Another mug shot from the archives is that of Anna Labelle, known at the time as Mme Émile Beauchamp, the most powerful brothel owner in Second World War-era Montreal. Mme Beauchamp - . who shows off her freckled features and pencil-thin eyebrows in her . mug shot - would reportedly arrive at the courthouse for her arrests in a Cadillac, her body wrapped in mink. Selling sex: Madam Liliane Brown (aka Ida Katz), who was one of the three most prominent brothel owners in the era, grins slyly in her black cap and leopard print coat . Distinctive look: Irene Lavallée, arrested in connection with an investigation into prostitution, has the plucked brows, curled hair and dark painted lips that were considered fashionable in the early 1940s . Crackdown: Annie Parker, who was arrested in 1941 in connection with an investigation into prostitution, also features among the women pictured . Unimpressed: Jeanine Lebrun, a maid, was arrested on April 11, 1940 for keeping a brothel, part of a city-wide effort to crack down on a booming prostitution industry . According . to Dangerous Minds, Montreal became a sex tourist destination after . World War I and during Prohibition, when Americans would drive north to . fulfill their illicit needs in Canada. Not . only did the city abound in drinking dens, brothels and gambling houses, but because . of its architecture and the language spoken there, it was viewed as an . extension of Europe, making it something of 'an exotic vacation.' But . following the end of Prohibition in 1933, as well as a sudden rise in . cases of sexually transmitted disease, Montreal prostitutes lost their exotic . allure and were instead seen as a force of corruption that needed to be . stopped - publicly, at least. Indeed, . while raids were frequent and arrests were many in the 1940s, fines . were low, and many prostitutes and brothel owners resumed business . shortly after their handcuffs were taken off. Local madam: Some addresses that were known to police as brothels were hit often. One such location was 1225 Bullion, a brothel kept by Fleurette Dubois. In her mug shot, Ms Dubois slouches and stares at the camera disinterestedly, her deep red lips, dark curls and pencil-thin eyebrows on display . Dual identity: Not all these women were prostitutes or madams in the traditional sense; one image is that of Blanche Martin, a servant who was arrested in May 1940 for owning a brothel . This was most likely another factor that contributed to the women's seeming nonchalance in their mug shots. Some . addresses that were known to police as brothels were hit often.

In May 1942, Ruby Taylor was also arrested at Ms Dubois' brothel as part of a police investigation into prostitution. Hers . is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating mug shots; in it, she bares . her teeth in a knowing grin, the corners of her eyes crinkling with mild . amusement. Ready for her close-up: Ruby Taylor, who was arrested in 1942 as part of an investigation in connection with prostitution, is the only woman to smile at the camera. Perhaps her knowing look had to do with the fact that many of the officers who arrested the sex workers were crooked cops that were also clients . Busted: Gisèle Roy, who had an alias of Marie-Jeanne Lambert, was arrested for prostitution in 1941 . Booming trade: Marguerite Smith was arrested several times between 1941 and 1943 for operating a brothel at 1225 Bullion . Arrested: Like Marguerite Smith, Madeleine Gagnon was also stopped at 1223 Bullion as part of an investigation in connection with prostitution . Some of the . other women arrested in this era in relation to prostitution include . stern-looking brunette Annie Parker and Mary Shepperd - a youthful woman . with eyebrows drawn so far apart that they lend her an air of sadness. Lina . Tony was arrested in December 1941 for owning two brothels on the same . road.

"'Socialist': Ed Miliband, pictured, was accused of being a 'card carrying Marxist' by Sir John Ritblat . One of Britain’s top businessmen has accused Ed Miliband of being a ‘card carrying Marxist’ who is ‘unfit to govern’. In the latest salvo from a captain of industry, Sir John Ritblat also accused the Labour leader of ‘learning nothing and forgetting everything’ from the financial crisis. Sir John, who bought British Land for £1million in 1970 and transformed it into one of the UK’s biggest and most successful companies, voiced concerns that a Labour government would ‘pick up some of the flaws of the French economy’. He said: ‘I would simply say there is a problem when the leadership is obviously very inexperienced, has never been involved in commerce and whose family tradition is one of left wing, totally unreconstructed, card carrying Marxists. This is not a good basis for pragmatic government.’ The 79-year-old City grandee, who was responsible for transforming the skyline of London with the development of the giant Broadgate office complex in the heart of the City, added: ‘This all adds to the impression that Mr Miliband is unfit to govern’. Last night one of Britain’s leading fashion entrepreneurs Harold Tillman also joined the backlash against Labour, accusing it of wanting to ‘stamp on aspiration.’ Arguing Mr Miliband warrants his ‘Red Ed’ nickname, Mr Tillman - who previously owned British fashion chain Jaeger - said: ‘I am only just realising how socialist Miliband is. I am shocked at this, but Labour sound as if they want to stamp on aspiration.’ The criticism will be blow to Labour, which this week slipped behind the Tories in the polls following a series of bruising battles with big businesses. A succession of company bosses have raised concerns about a lurch to the left under a Labour government and accused the party of not supporting business and enterprise. Labour’s plans to freeze energy prices and break up the banks recently prompted former Marks & Spencer boss Lord Rose to brand Mr Miliband a ‘1970s throwback’ whose policies echo those of the socialist Labour government of that era. Mr Miliband’s late father Ralph was a Marxist intellectual who rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s. Business leader: Sir John, pictured, voiced concerns that a Labour government would ‘pick up some of the flaws of the French economy’ The opposition leader has spoken of the formative influence of his father, recalling political discussions around the dinner table at the family home in Primrose Hill. Mr Miliband also alarmed the business community after cosying up to Francois Hollande’s socialist French government after its 2012 victory. Last week one of the world’s biggest investment banks, Bank of America warned Labour would reduce Britain to an economic basketcase like France, with stunted growth and soaring unemployment. Sir John Ritblat, who retired from British Land in 2006 and is now chairman of family property company Delancey which is involved in redeveloping the Olympic village site in East London, said: . ‘I don’t want to go the way of France and other high tax regimes, but there is a real danger that we could end up picking up some of the flaws of the French economy (under Labour)’. Referring to the financial crisis which started under the previous Labour government, Sir John - a Conservative Party donor - said: . ‘It is very disappointing that the Labour leaders have learnt nothing and forgotten everything. This collective amnesia about the damage caused to the economy under the previous Labour government is extraordinary’. Mr Miliband was ridiculed for failing to mention the near £100billion budget deficit in his party conference speech last September. The concerns among business leaders were echoed by fashion entrepreneur Harold Tillman, 69. He said: ‘Labour would be very bad for the economy and very bad for employment. We need to be creating a nation of entrepreneurs. It is idiotic to criticise businesses.’ The boss of one of the country’s leading manufacturers also warned of the danger of returning to failed 1970’s socialism under a Labour government. John Neill, the chief executive of motor parts and logistics giant Unipart , which was carved out of the old British Leyland empire, said he has bad memories of the 1970s when British Leyland was riven by strikes. He said he is worried about the risk of going back to the ‘failed models of the past’. Attacking Mr Miliband’s plans to freeze energy prices as ‘harebrained’, he said: . ‘We cannot afford to be complacent. Think about China. How do we compete, how do we achieve that if we go back to the failed models of the past. I am concerned we might do that yes. Labour has come under attack from a long list of prominent businessmen, including Sir Charles Dunston, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse and Sir Ian Cheshire, who ran the DIY chain B&Q.","Sir John Ritblat accused Miliband of 'learning nothing' from financial crisis .

"Former NFL star and ‘Inside the NFL’ host Ahmad Rashad is reportedly dating President Barack Obama’s senior adviser. Rumors have been flying all over the capital that Rashad and Valerie Jarrett are an item, but no one appears willing to confirm or deny the supposed romance. Rashad himself told the New York Times to 'get a hobby while I get my phone number taken off the listing’ when asked about he and Jarrett. Are they an item: Gossip columns and the capital are chattering about the possible pairing of NBC host Ahmad Rashad (left) and senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett . The former Minnesota Viking’s appearances at Michelle Obama’s 50th birthday party earlier this year and at the president’s unveiling of his ‘Mr Bother’s Keeper’ initiative aimed at helping young black man find career paths only further stoked the rumor mill flames. Whispers grew into chatter though when Rashad was seen playing golf with President Obama on a recent family vacation – Jarrett did not join them on the links but was on the trip, the Times noted. The paper also mentioned the White House press office ‘strongly objected’ to their report on what may be Washington’s latest power couple, and no photos of them together are to be found anywhere. ‘They haven’t gone out in public,’ an unnamed source told New York Post columnist Richard Johnson last November. ‘They are sneaking around.’ Rashad’s brother also did not appear willing to confirm or deny his brother’s relationship status with the Times. ‘I know Valerie is the president’s head girl, but I didn’t know anything about that,’ said Robert Moore. Rashad changed his name from Bobby Moore decades ago when he converted to the Muslim religion.

One former White House staffer is said to have asked ‘what the hell is going on out there’ after seeing the popular NBC personality putting with Obama. But Moore has other ideas, and joked to the Times that ‘maybe we’ll get an ambassadorship.’ Chatter, jokes and whispers may be all there is until Rashad and Jarrett both step forward – if they ever do.","Multiple reports have said former NFL star and current NBC personality Ahmad Rashad is dating senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett .

"There was renewed speculation over Vladimir Putin's love life last night after TV footage showed his rumoured girlfriend wearing a 'wedding ring'. As the Russian President was hosting the Winter Olympics in Sochi, glamorous champion gymnast Alina Kabayeva, 30, was at a children’s sporting event in the industrial city of Nizhnekamsk, where she showed her ring finger to TV camera crews, prompting a flurry of internet comments. Putin, 61, was also shown wearing a wedding ring during a meeting with the Egyptian defence minister last week, before a Kremlin-friendly news website withdrew the picture saying it predated last June’s announcement that he and his wife Lyudmila were to divorce.

Russian women wear the wedding ring on their right hand. The Kremlin has previously denied claims President Putin married Miss Kabayeva in the town of Valdai in September . At the time Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most charismatic political rival, tweeted: ‘I’m told that Putin and Kabayeva are marrying today at the Iver Monastery. All of Valdai sealed off.’ However, Mr Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later dismissed the claims as ‘an internet exercise to relieve boredom’. Valdai is in the Novgorod region, where 60-year-old Putin was based in September for an international conference involving politicians and journalists. The Kremlin were forced to deny that Putin had tied the knot with Miss Kabayeva in the town of Valdai in September, late last year . Speculation of the pair's union was rife after Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most charismatic political rival, tweeted: ‘I’m told that Putin and Kabayeva are marrying today at the Iver Monastery.

Claims that the pair have children together have also been dismissed. This week the former KGB man indicated he may stand for office again in 2018. Putin was first elected in 2000 and served two four year terms until he handed control of the country to puppet president Dmitry Medvedev who served until 2012 when Putin was reelected, this time for a six-year term. If reelected the hardline ruler will have been in power for nearly a quarter of a century which will make him the nation's longest-serving leader since Joseph Stalin. Putin stepped out of the presidential limelight and became prime minister in 2008 to observe a limit of two consecutive terms. However, he maintained his grip on power from the shadows with his longtime ally, Dmitry Medvedev, serving as a placeholder.","Renewed rumours President Putin has married gold-medalist Alina Kabayeva .

"A 20-year-old self-proclaimed 'pothead princess' from Florida tweeted the words '2 drunk 2 care' just hours before allegedly causing a horrific wrong-way crash that killed two young women. Police say Kayla Mendoza, of Hallandale Beach, was the culprit in the Saturday night accident on Sawgrass Expressway that resulted in the deaths of Marisa Caran Catronio and Kaitlyn Nicole Ferrante. Catronio was pronounced dead at the scene. Her friend was rushed to a hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries this morning. Scroll down for video . Party girl: Kayla Mendoza, the 20-year-old self-proclaimed 'pothead princess' who posted photos of joints on her Twitter account, is allegedly responsible for a wrong-way crash that killed two women . Less than three hours before the wrong-way crash on November 17 last year, Mendoza tweeted that she was '2 drunk 2 care' Addict: Mendoza's Twitter account is filled with posts about her marijuana habit . Evidence: The 20-year-old was not shy about sharing photos of weed . Mendoza, who remained in serious condition at an area hospital earlier this week, has not been shy about her suspected drug use and weakness for alcohol on Twitter, as Miami New Times first reported. Posting under the user name 'Kaila Mendoza,' the T-Mobile sales associate has fired off dozens of tweets about being high and rolling blunts. Just after 11pm Saturday, less than three hours before the deadly collision, Mendoza posted a message that read: '2 drunk 2 care.' Second fatality: Kaitlyn Ferrante passed away from her injuries in a hospital four days after the collision .

On November 9, Mendoza tweeted: 'Can't sleep without my bedtime blunt.' A week earlier, she shared with her 631 followers: 'I really am so baked right now.' Mendoza's Facebook page, however, paints a slightly different portrait of the Florida party girl.

"Les Kiss, the pioneer of the choke tackle, has rejected Wales coach Shaun Edwards' claims the technique is 'very dangerous'. Ireland assistant coach Kiss claimed Edwards was 'wide of the mark' to label the ploy 'a blight on the game', suggesting tackling with a bid to hold players off the ground leads to clashes of heads. Former Australia rugby league star Kiss devised the choke tackle in 2011, where defenders wrap up attackers and hold them off the ground to form a stagnant maul that wins a turnover via the scrum put-in. Jack Nowell is choke tackled by Dave Kearney (left) and Gordon D'Arcy at Twickenham last season . The choke tackle involves a defender wrapping his arms around the neck and chest of the ball-carrier — often one who is isolated and too upright — and preventing him from going to ground. With assistance from team-mates, this can lead to the ball being stripped or a maul forming, which can produce a penalty to the defending team if the opposition collapse it in their bid retrieve the ball. If a maul forms and the ball doesn’t emerge, the defending team will win the put-in at the subsequent scrum. Kiss defended Ireland's right to use the perfectly-legal tactic ahead of Joe Schmidt's side hosting England in Sunday's RBS 6 Nations Grand Slam eliminator. 'Look, there has been a little bit said. I've got a lot of respect for Shaun Edwards actually but I think he's a little bit wide of the mark saying it's the cause of a lot of concussions,' said Kiss. 'By virtue of the tackle itself you have to cool your jets a bit and wrap a bit more to get under the ball, so you actually have less heat in the collision to actually affect it properly. 'When you do a lot of chop tackles there's a danger there where you can get hit by knees and hips as well, so the baseline for us, we just try to coach as good technique as we can in whatever tackle we use. Les Kiss has rejected Wales coach Shaun Edwards' (pictured) claims the technique is 'very dangerous' 'It's one of the forms of tackle we have, we try to vary it up in a tactical sense as well, and a lot of clubs and countries are using it now as an effective weapon. 'But I don't think you can overuse it, and that's where England have been quite astute as well to mix up how they do use it. 'But I don't agree that it's a dangerous form of tackle that's for sure.'","Les Kiss rejected Shaun Edwards claim that choke tackle is dangerous .

"Replacement Ben Spencer had the final say at Allianz Park after his three second-half penalties saw Saracens snatch a 22-17 win over Newcastle. Andy Saull and Alesana Tuilagi crashed over for the Falcons in the first half, either side of a David Strettle try, but Saracens entered the break with a slender lead through the boot of Charlie Hodgson. However, a Hodgson injury meant scrum-half Spencer took over kicking duties in the second half and his three penalties, despite a converted try for Will Welch, secured the victory. The Saracens players celebrate victory over Newcastle in the Aviva Premiership match . Jacques Burger (centre) of Saracens is tackled by Scott Lawson of Newcastle Falcons . Nils Mordt (right) juggles the ball as he takes on Juan Pablo Socino of Newcastle Falcons . The two sides put on a showcase of enterprising rugby at Kingston Park in December - Juan Socino missing a last-gasp conversion which would have handed the Falcons a draw - and this clash started in much the same fashion. Saull benefited from a powerful driving maul, formed as a result of Tom Catterick's decision to find touch, and the flanker drove on to put Newcastle ahead within the opening four minutes. Catterick failed to convert and when Hodgson was presented with a penalty directly in front of the posts, Aviva Premiership Rugby's all-time top points scorer reduced the deficit to 5-3. With just over 10 minutes played, the hosts found more answers after quick hands set up Strettle to dive over in the corner, with Hodgson converting. However, in a tit-for-tat clash Newcastle soon levelled the scores through the bulldozing Tuilagi. The 34-year-old picked up the ball and charged down the wing, running straight at last man Strettle whose attempted tackle barely slowed the Samoan down. Half an hour in, Hodgson's close-range penalty put Saracens back in front by three points, but moments later the fly-half had to come off with an injury to his hamstring. Nevertheless Sarries were in the ascendancy and Newcastle did well to hold them back before the half-time whistle blew. Neil de Kock had also left the field due to a knock to his head and his replacement, Spencer, would go onto have a vital say in the second half. Alex Tait's swift break looked to be leading Newcastle to a perfect start and, after numerous phases, another maul formed at the line-out was driven over by captain Welch. Catterick's first successful conversion of the afternoon gave the visitors a four-point advantage but only a determined defensive effort from the visitors made sure Saracens did not reply immediately. The Falcons' defence eventually gave away a penalty after 56 minutes which a confident Spencer made no mistake with.

The scrum-half then nosed Saracens ahead five minutes later with another well-taken penalty, this time from the sidelines. Catterick broke free from the Saracens defence with seven minutes left to play but a second's indecision from the fly-half, in which he failed to release club top-scorer Sinoti Sinoti, gave Saracens a chance to regroup and quell a dangerous attack. Spencer's third penalty of the afternoon was just as good as his previous, sailing through the posts from 35 yards before the hosts managed to see out the remaining five minutes.","Charlie Hodgson got injured, so Ben Spencer took over kicking duties .

Tristan Vandeworp posted this happy looking selfie with his friends on Instragram at a cafe . 1. Don't have the stick in the picture. 2. Capture the best angle, try turning your head a few degrees to the right or left, your features will appear less flat . 3. Show off something new in your selfie like haircut or new item of clothing . 4. Enhance one of your features e.g. wear lots of mascara or a bright lipstick and keep the rest natural . 5. You need good lighting for the best selfies. 6. Use the phone's back camera because it will take a higher resolution picture. 7. Think about what background you want, the best selfies have something interesting behind the subject. It is a trend that's especially popular in Asia, including Indonesia. Soulaya Lestary, 20, from Indonesia, told The Huffington Post: 'We use social media all the time and because we’re shy to ask someone, [to] take picture of us,’ it’s easier to do it ourselves.' Meanwhile, a number of existing monopods can be used with iPhones, from companies including Interfit. They work by holding the camera in landscape mode, with the screen facing the photographer and using the front-facing camera. Buttons on the handle of the stick are used to control the device. Depending on the model, some monopods will manually press the shutter button on the side of phone using an arm, or similar, while others connect remotely via Bluetooth and take the photo using software controls.

"Twins Peder and Steen Mondrup have become heroes among the endurance racing community after Peder became the first person with cerebral palsy to complete an Ironman. Despite being confined to a wheelchair his entire life, he has completed the KMD Ironman Copenhagen Challenge using a specially designed wheelchair that his brother Steen pushed and pulled across the circuit. The Danish twins, who competed in the event this week as Team Tvilling, were first required to swim 3.8km. For this, Steen first pulled Peder in a rubber boat through the entire swim. Scroll down for video . The finish line nears as Steen and Peder run past hundreds of spectators cheering them on . Steen Mondrup pulling his brother Peder on a rubber dinghy through the swimming leg of the race . Steen carrying his brother to the next race stage during the transition from the swim . Following this, the twins rode a double bicycle for a 180km, then ran a 42.2km marathon before Steen pushed his brother across the finish line in his racing wheelchair. The brothers completed the circuit in a time of 15 hours, 42 minutes and 38 seconds. They wrote on their website afterwards: 'We did it! Thank you. Congratulations to all competitors. We are proud to be racing with you!' The two were born three months prematurely but Peder suffered from a lack of oxygen, causing cerebral palsy and leaving him wheelchair-bound. But it has been no barrier, with the 34-year-old and his brother forming a formidable duo in what is considered one of the most gruelling of all endurance sports. Steen Mondrup then pushed his brother 42.2km through the running stage of the Ironman in Copenhagen . The brothers stop for a quick drink during the race. The twins said they were inspired by Team Hoyt - a U.S. father-son duo who race together despite son Rick Hoyt being wheelchair bound . The twin's inspiration lies with Team Hoyt, a father and son duo who together compete in marathons and Ironman competitions. Rick Hoyt, 51, was diagnosed with celebral palsy at birth, but in 1977 told his father Dick Hoyt that he wanted to take part in a five mile benefit run. The father son duo use a racing technique similar to the Mondrup brothers involving special two-seater bikes and running wheelchairs. The two have now competed in more than 1000 events.","Danish twin with cerebral palsy completes Ironman at his brother's side .

"His fist-pumping 'Ronny Roar' celebration has become a big noise in recent weeks, but the Celtic manager admits he would like to hear his defenders turn up the volume as they prepare to face Inter Milan in the San Siro this week. The sight of Ronny Deila making his way to the club's support and whipping the fans into a ferment has added colour to the Scottish football season but, while the boss may ooze flamboyant charisma, he admits his team is short of like-minded rabble-rousers. Out with the warrior-like presence of his captain Scott Brown and, when he is in the team, the ebullience of on-loan striker John Guidetti, Deila admits his team lacks natural leaders, the sort of men who use words to spark their colleagues into action. Rory Deila has called for more discipline from his team following their 3-3 draw with Inter Milan . The silent treatment may suffice when facing the routine Premiership opposition but, step up a level or two to the Europea League, and the Norwegian reckons he could be doing with a lot more communication among his defenders. His two full-backs, Adam Matthews and Emilio Izaguirre, may like to attack with a certain flamboyance but are among the most reticent footballers you could ever meet. At 19, Jason Denayer has the makings of a quality centre-half but has yet to find his voice. Even Virgil van Dijk, a man not short on belief in his own abilities, has had to be coaxed out of his shell by the club's coaching staff. Goalkeeper Craig Gordon, meanwhile, asserts his authority by exuding a Zen-like calm. Two rare errors from Gordon may offer a partial explanation for the first-leg 3-3 scoreline from three nights ago but Deila would also like the men in front of him to assert themselves better. He knows his team must score at least once in Italy to have any hope of progressing to the last 16 but a clean sheet would do just as much to help. The portents are not good — Celtic have shipped an eye-watering 23 goals in 13 European matches this season and the prospects of finding a way to plug all the gaps between now and Thursday appear slim. Celtic striker John Guidetti scored injury-time goal to secure an improbable draw against Inter Milan . That won't stop Deila trying. Organisation will be key on the Nerazzurri's home patch and that's likely to be a central theme in training this week. 'I think we can keep a clean sheet but we have to cut out the easy mistakes and improve the communication in the team, especially at the back,' said Deila. 'Everything is possible. It will be a great achievement if we go through and beat them in Milan, but the players have to talk more. 'I think they need matches like this, that's important. Our central defenders are both young and very talented and there's a lot of attention on them when they play these games. They have to deal with that. 'There are 20 clubs coming to watch them. So it's mentally tough, especially for young players. 'We have to bring it out of them. We have Broony who talks with the players around him but it's very important to get experience into that central spine of the team. It's also something to look for when we're bringing in players — a leadership style. 'Craig speaks a lot with his body — he's very calm and reads situations very well but he could also be more vocal. Virgil has stepped up in that way, he's much better than he has been, but he's still young. So to have an experienced central defender could be a good thing.' Having held on to van Dijk in the face of interest from English clubs, including Southampton and Sunderland, it seems likely that Celtic will cash in on the Dutch international hopeful at the end of the season. Guidetti connected with Liam Henderson's pass with a left-footed finish to score against the Italian giants . Deila has repeatedly gone on record with his desire to extend Denayer's loan transfer from Manchester City into a second season but the Belgian has been less willing to talk up the chances of another year at Parkhead. If Deila does indeed find himself in the market for a centre-half with an old head and an active tongue, it won't be through choice. 'If I had to choose, I would not bring anybody in,' he insisted. 'I'd stick with the two I have because they have the future in front of them.' That Deila is talking about communication is instructive. Six months ago, the Norwegian had the more fundamental issue of fitness on his mind as his players struggled to adopt the high-tempo pressing game he had deployed at his previous club Stromsgodset. In the first leg against Inter, Deila's team was unrecognisable from the group that laboured against Legia Warsaw and, to a lesser extent, Maribor in the Champions League qualifiers. 'We looked fit,' he agreed. 'We kept at Inter for 90 minutes, pushed them backwards and could keep them under pressure for good periods. 'We were not able to do that six months ago. 'I think we saw that against Legia Warsaw — the team couldn't cope with it and lost the game big time. So we are taking steps all the time, showing that everything is possible. 'We scored three goals against an Italian team, a Roberto Mancini team, so it's a good performance. The sad part is we gave away two easy goals. 'We have to defend more in Italy but also we have to vary our pressure. The key is to stay compact for 90 minutes because you know they have players who can exploit your mistakes quickly.' Although Inter have been displaying shaky form domestically, the concession of three goals in Glasgow on Thursday was an anomaly — in the previous eight European ties played this season, Mancini's defence had been breached only twice. Leigh Griffiths (left) and Gary Mackay-Steven congratulate Stuart Armstrong after Celtic's second goal . The thrust of Matthews down the right flank was instrumental in unsettling Inter, with the full-back showing drive and then composure to square the ball for Stuart Armstrong and kick-start the comeback from 2-0 down. Armstrong and his old Dundee United pal Gary Mackay-Steven were both excellent on their home debuts for the club and they have added extra pace to the mix. 'I think we have a lot of speed in the team now and players who can do something,' said Deila. 'The relationships in the side are better, so we create things from the sides.' The end of the match brought Deila on to the pitch but there was to be none of his trademark theatrics, just a few waves of gratitude at the part played by the crowd on a memorable night. While accepting that a 0-0 scoreline might statistically have given his team a better chance in the return leg, you suspect he wouldn't have changed a thing about the emotionally-charged match that ended on the crescendo caused by Guidetti's stoppage-time equaliser. 'For me, football is about entertainment, we have to entertain the fans and also get results,' he added. 'The Celtic fans are intelligent, they have seen so much football and they know what they like. 'They were happy because we gave everything and also because we tried to create and attack. 'You have to believe in a style but I'm not doing this for romance, I'm doing this to get results and I believe we can do it.'","Celtic drew 3-3 in the Europa League round of 32 first leg .

"England are braced for an aerial bombardment directed by Ireland's Test Lions half-backs when the RBS Six Nations title rivals lock horns at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday. The Red Rose back three of Alex Goode, Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell face a busy afternoon patrolling the wide open spaces of Lansdowne Road to counter the pinpoint kicking of Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton. It promises to be a key battleground in the seismic showdown between the Six Nations' only unbeaten teams, with the winners placing themselves on the home straight towards a precious Grand Slam. Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton celebrates victory over France in their last Six Nations clash . Conor Murray is also a threat to England with his kicking game, according to Mike Catt . 'Conor Murray and Sexton are the in-form nine and 10 in the world at the moment. They control the game exceptionally well,' attacking skills coach Mike Catt said. 'From that point of view their aerial route with Tommy Bowe, Simon Zebo and Rob Kearney is very formidable. 'They have a very good kicking game. We have to match them and try and get the better of them in certain aspects of our game. 'It will be a hugely exciting Test match, two positive sides playing some exciting rugby. It should be a great spectacle. 'Ireland have a really good balance to their game and have some dangerous and smart players.'

"This was just the second time in three years England manager Roy Hodgson has dared to venture to the Stadium of Light but on the evidence of this sour stalemate he will not be back. It was not just the Three Lions contenders — Saido Berahino and Jermain Defoe — who failed to impress; every player on the pitch was as desperate as the next. Referee Mike Jones and his assistants were equally inept, failing to send off West Brom’s Joleon Lescott early in the game and later denying Sunderland a legitimate goal. Jermain Defoe  is tackled by Chris Brunt during the League match between Sunderland and West Brom . Sunderland manager Gus Poyet on the side line during the Premier League game at Stadium of Light . The draw — Sunderland’s 13th of the Premier League season — has done little to ease the pressure on Black Cats boss Gus Poyet, who this week wrote to the fans asking for their support. But the Uruguayan did have reason to moan about some first-half refereeing. The game was just five minutes old when Lee Cattermole sprung Danny Graham clear on the shoulder of Lescott and, under minimal contact from the recovering defender, the striker flopped to the turf. Man of the moment Brown Ideye fails to continue his fine goal scoring run against West Brom . Referee Jones waved play on, only for assistant Constantine Hatzidakis to flag for an infringement. Lescott, then, would surely have to go. Jones, though, opted to show a yellow. The officials were again the centre of attention when they disallowed Adam Johnson’s goal on the stroke of half-time. Ricky Alvarez crossed to the far post where the winger — played marginally onside by Craig Dawson — poked in. Poyet said: ‘It’s onside. I understand why he gave offside, but it was a mistake. Ben Foster makes a save during the Premier League match between Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion . Poyet lets his feelings be heard during the goalless draw against West Brom at the Stadium of Light . ‘I was more disappointed with the Lescott one. If you make the decision it’s a foul then it should be a red card.’ But Baggies boss Tony Pulis said: ‘I’ve seen old women in the high street take more of a knock and stay on their feet.’ West Brom, though, barely mustered a shot on goal with Berahino failing to impress in front of Hodgson. Pulis added: ‘Saido has been fantastic for us but he took a knock early in the game and struggled. He’s had better days.’ As has everyone who had the misfortune to be at the Stadium of Light.

"She was dubbed the 'Angel Maker', a prolific serial killer responsible for the murders of around 400 babies, horrific crimes that sent a shock wave through 19th century Britain. Amelia Dyer preyed on the down-on-their-luck, desperate unmarried mothers who paid her to have their children adopted in the naive belief she would find them a better life. But there would be no fairytale endings, instead this despicable woman simply took the money before strangling the helpless infants with dressmaking tape and dumping their bodies in the River Thames as reported by The Independent. Angel of death: Victorian serial killer Amelia Dyer is believed to have killed up to 400 babies . For over 30 years Dyer was able to conduct her grisly trade with apparent impunity. Little wonder that she is now believed to be Britain's worst ever serial killer. Her crimes have come to light once again after more than 2.5million criminal records from between 1770 and 1934 were placed online by the National Archives. The intriguing records chronicle the crimes and punishments of some of the worst murderers and villains ever to roam these lands. But even among this company of loathsome individuals Dyer stands apart. She began to conduct her grisly trade in Bristol in the late 1860s, opening a house of confinement in the suburb of Totterdown where she took in unmarried pregnant women who had nowhere else to go. Some would ask her to smother their babies at birth, crimes that went unchallenged as Victorian doctors were unable to tell the difference between suffocation and still-birth. A cell and the galleries at Newgate prison where Amelia Dyer was jailed before her hanging in 1896 . An artist's drawing of three people being hanged outside Newgate prison where Amelia Dyer also met her end . Amelia Dyer's shocking crimes stunned Victorian Britain. Her case was so sensational that songs were written about her and Britain's adoption and child protection laws had to be toughened up in response to the public outcry . Then Dyer moved began offering a fostering . service, which involved her simply drugging the babies with laudanum, a powerful opiate, to keep . them quite while she slowly starved them. This went on for almost a decade until she was found guilty of infant neglect and sentenced to paltry six-months in prison. By the time she came out she had a developed a new business plan. The logic was simple; why deal with . all the bother of actually looking after the children when she could offer a one-off full adoption . service and simply kill them. Angel Maker: Dyer was hanged at Newgate Gaol, near the Old Bailey in London, in 1896 . She . moved to Reading and soon found her services in high demand - . eyewitnesses reported seeing as many as six babies a day coming into her . home. Police would later find evidence of around 20 children who had been entrusted to her care in the two months before her arrest. She was finally arrested following the discovery of the body of an infant in the reeds of the Thames. An address on the parcel paper led the police to her rented terraced house.. Inside her house of horrors they were met with the stench of rotting flesh emanating from the kitchen pantry and from a trunk under her bed. They discovered baby clothes, vaccination papers as well as letters and receipts for her newspaper advertisements offering adoption services. A search of the River Thames was hastily ordered. After 50 bodies had been discovered she admitted to police: 'You'll know all mine by the tape around their necks. Her case was so sensational that songs were written about her and Britain's adoption and child protection laws had to be toughened up in response to the public outcry. Dyer was hanged at Newgate Gaol, near the Old Bailey in London, in 1896. She was 58.

"A Chinese woman has revealed she was dragged from her home in the middle of the night and forced to have an abortion, three months before her child was due to be born. Liu Xinwen, 33, and her husband Zhou Guoqiang were left devastated after the mother-of-one was pulled from her bed and taken to hospital to be injected with an abortion-inducing drug. The forced abortion is due to China's strict one-baby policy, introduced in 1979 to keep the country's population under control - the couple already have a son. Scroll down for video .

The baby died in her womb and was delivered a day later - a horrific photo shows the foetus in an orange bucket next to Liu Xinwen curled up on the hospital bed.

Known to many as the one-child policy, China's actual rules are more complicated. The government limits most urban couples to one child, and allows two children for rural families if their firstborn is a girl. Numerous other exceptions include looser rules for minority families and a two-child limit for parents who are themselves both singletons. There has been growing speculation among Chinese media, experts and ordinary people about whether the government will soon relax the one-child policy — introduced in 1980 as a temporary measure to curb surging population growth — and allow more people to have two children. Though the government credits the policy with preventing hundreds of millions of births and helping lift countless families out of poverty, it is reviled by many ordinary people. The strict limits have led to forced abortions and sterilizations, even though such measures are illegal. Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs. Many today also see the birth limits as outdated, a relic of the era when housing, jobs and food were provided by the state. She told Sky News that after her son was born she had a contraceptive coil inserted, a procedure proscribed by China. She said it must have failed and she discovered she was expecting a second child when she was four months into the pregnancy. The couple decided against informing the authorities as they feared a forced abortion and instead hoped to pay a fine after the birth - this is sometimes acceptable in parts of China. It is not clear how authorities found out Liu Xinwen was pregnant. The Chinese Embassy in London told Sky News they were looking into the case. In July a man stabbed to death two government workers in China after they told him they couldn't register his fourth child. They had told the man they were . unable to record the birth because he had not paid a fine for breaching . China's family planning laws. The . official Xinhua News Agency, said staff at the Dongxing City Family . Planning Bureau - which comes under Fangchenggang city - had refused to . register the man's fourth child for a hukou, or resident's certificate, . because he hadn't paid a social compensation fee. The fine is levied on parents who break family planning laws and can be up to 10 times a family's annual income. A child without a hukou faces problems registering for education, health care and government benefits. Known to many as the one-child policy, China's actual rules are complicated. The government limits most urban couples to one child, and allows two children for rural families if their firstborn is a girl.

Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs. Many demographers argue that the policy has worsened the country's aging crisis by limiting the size of the young labor pool that must support the large baby boom generation as it retires. They say it has contributed to the imbalanced sex ratio by encouraging families to abort baby girls, preferring to try for a male heir.","Liu Xinwen, 33, and her husband Zhou Guoqiang were left devastated .

"Mixed emotions: Statue of Hitler kneeling in Warsaw ghetto where tens of thousands of Jews died has upset descendents . A modern artist has caused huge controversy after placing a statue of Adolf Hitler praying on his knees in the former Warsaw Ghetto. Some Jewish groups have expressed fury at the 'senseless' decision to install the provocative artwork in the area where thousands of Jews were forced to live during the rule of the Nazi regime. In total, around 300,000 Jews from the Ghetto died or were sent to their death in concentration camps. The statue by Italian artist Maurizio . Cattelan, entitled 'HIM', has attracted a large number of visitors since . its installation last month. The work is visible only from a distance, and the artist has not said what he intends viewers to read into Hitler's pose. Organisers of the exhibition of which . the statue is a part say its point is to make people reflect on the . nature of evil - but some are angered by its placement in such a . sensitive site. One Jewish advocacy group, . the Simon Wiesenthal Center, this week called the statue's placement 'a . senseless provocation which insults the memory of the Nazis' Jewish . victims'. 'As far as the Jews were concerned, . Hitler's only ""prayer"" was that they be wiped off the face of the . earth,' said the group's Israel director, Efraim Zuroff. However, others have praised the artwork's emotional impact. And organisers defend putting it on display in the former ghetto. Fabio Cavallucci, director of the Centre . for Contemporary Art, which oversaw the installation, said: 'There is . no intention from the side of the artist or the center to insult Jewish . memory. Controversy: This statue of Adolf Hitler on his knees praying has been installed in the Warsaw Ghetto . 'It's an artwork that tries to speak about the situation of hidden evil everywhere.' The Warsaw Ghetto was an area of the city which the Nazis sealed off after they invaded Poland. They forced Jews to live in cramped, inhuman conditions there as they awaited deportation to death camps. Many died from hunger or disease or were shot by the Germans before they could be transported to the camps. Hidden: The statue by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan is visible only through a hole in a door . Fury: The statue has drawn condemnation from Jewish groups which regard it as a 'senseless provocation' The Hitler installation is just one . object in a retrospective of Cattelan's work titled 'Amen', a show that . explores life, death, good and evil. The other works are on display at . the centre itself, which is housed in the Ujazdowski Castle. The . statue is visible from a hole in a wooden gate across town on Prozna . Street. Viewers only see the back of the small figure praying in a . courtyard. Because of its small size, it appears to be a harmless . schoolboy. 'Every criminal was once a tender, innocent and defenseless child,' the centre says in a commentary on the work. Visitors: Some who have seen the statue praised its shocking emotional impact . Thought-provoking: Exhibition organisers say they want viewers to reflect on the nature of evil . The Warsaw Ghetto was established in the Polish capital in 1940, while the country was being occupied by Nazi Germany. All 400,000 Jews living in the city, which was then a major centre of Jewish culture, were ordered to live in the area, which was surrounded by a 10ft wall. Even though the Ghetto housed 30 per cent of Warsaw's population, it occupied just one-fortieth of the city's area, leading to unbearably cramped conditions. The area was plagued with disease and starvation, causing the deaths of thousands - but the worst horrors came between July and September 1942, when more than 250,000 residents were sent to the Treblinka camp, where nearly all were murdered by the Nazis. In January 1943, German soldiers started another round of deportations, but this time the Jewish residents fought back. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising briefly succeeded in stopping the deportations, but later that year was brutally put down. 56,000 Jews were killed or deported in retribution. Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said he was consulted on the installation's placement ahead of time and did not oppose it because he accepted the artist's attempt to raise moral questions by provoking viewers. He said he was reassured by curators who told him there was no intention of rehabilitating Hitler, but rather of showing that evil can present itself in the guise of a 'sweet praying child'. 'I felt there could be educational value to it,' said Mr Schudrich, who also wrote an introduction to the exhibition's catalogue in which he says art can 'force us to face the evil of the world.' On Friday, a stream of people walked by to view the work, and many praised it. 'It had a big emotional impact on me. It's provocative, but it's not offensive,' said Zofia Jablonska, a 30-year-old lawyer. 'Having him pray in the place where he would kill people - this was the best place to put it.' Cattelan caused controversy in Warsaw in 2000 when another gallery showed his work 'La Nona Ora' - 'The Ninth Hour' - which depicts Pope John Paul II being crushed by a meteorite. That offended many in Poland, which is deeply Catholic and was John Paul's homeland.","Statue of dictator on his knees praying created by artist Maurizio Cattelan .

"Access: Steven Smith, chairman of PIE, worked at the Home Office . The former leader of a pro-paedophile campaign boasted of storing the group’s files in the Home Office while he worked there. Steven Smith, 60, said he was given security clearance for his Whitehall job by Scotland Yard despite being chairman of the Paedophile Information Exchange. He worked as an electrical contractor monitoring security alarms at the Home Office for four years in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Smith later went on the run while facing charges over child abuse images. He was jailed in 1991 and again in 2011. In an obscure book published in 1986, he told how he was given a room of his own at the Home Office and used it to conceal PIE’s files. ‘For four years I was employed by a firm of electrical contractors, Complete Maintenance, to monitor a control panel of alarm systems at the Home Office,’ he said. ‘The job entailed practically no work on my part, beyond attending the panel, and in fact I had a furnished office completely to myself seven days a week on a  rotating shift basis. ‘Much of PIE’s less sensitive file material was stored in locked cabinets there, where no police raid would ever have found them. Each year my security clearance was renewed by Scotland Yard without my connection with PIE being discovered.’ He claimed he used a phone number in the Home Office building as a contact point for PIE. A later trial heard that he probably published an obscene magazine from inside the ministry. Smith, also known as Stephen Freeman, lost his job when his role in PIE was exposed by a newspaper in 1982. He said he had hoped the revelation that the leader of a paedophile group had been employed in the heart of Westminster would lead to the resignation of then Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw. But no heads rolled – and it appears that there was only a limited official investigation into his role at the department. ‘The extent of security chiefs’ knowledge of my activities did not prompt them to investigate the content of my filing cabinets, and a carload of PIE files was safely spirited from the building before it could occur to them to intervene,’ he wrote. A second senior PIE official, the group’s secretary and treasurer Barry Cutler, is also said to have worked at the Home Office in the early 1980s. In 1983, it was reported that a Home Office civil servant had received a series of slides with images of abuse of young boys and obscene letters delivered to his departmental address. One colleague protested that the material should be handed over to the police, but this was ignored and it was treated as a purely internal matter, according to a Daily Express report at the time. Smith fled to Holland in 1984 to escape trial after PIE was infiltrated by headmaster and anti-child abuse campaigner Charles Oxley. Smith claimed political asylum by arguing that he was part of a minority political group campaigning for changes in the law in the UK. He returned to Britain in 1991 in the . mistaken belief he would not be arrested and was jailed at the Old . Bailey for 18 months after he admitted publishing an obscene magazine . and sending it through the post. Smith worked as an electrical contractor monitoring security alarms at the Home Office (when it was was situated in its former location in Petty France, Westminster, above) for four years in the late 1970s and 1980s . In 2011 he received another prison sentence of at least 30 months as ringleader of a paedophile group that distributed drawings depicting child abuse. Tom O’Carroll, another former PIE chairman, wrote a book defending having sex with children called Paedophilia: The Radical Case. He shared a platform with Labour ex-health secretary Patricia Hewitt at a gay rights conference in 1977, but was jailed for two years in 1981 for conspiring to corrupt public morals.

"Las Vegas residents fear voodoo rituals are to blame for piles of headless cockerels and pigeons that are being found on the city's streets. Piles of birds, intact save for their heads, have been left in several locations in the past few weeks, but every time they are cleared away, more bodies appear. West African priest Duane Reece has confirmed that the sightings could be linked to magic rituals, saying someone could be trying to use voodoo to appease a spirit. Scroll down for video . Ritual: The appearance of headless roosters in the back alleys of Las Vegas has been blamed on voodoo rituals . The birds are mostly roosters and pigeons, and they appear in perfect condition except that their heads have been neatly lopped off. Street cleaner Ryan Roskins started to see the headless chickens a few weeks back, and told KLAS-TV he has continued to see carcasses as he makes his rounds. 'The first time I saw it, it was a large rooster. Everything else is there, feet, feathers. It’s just decapitated,' he said. 'I actually think it must be voodoo.' Reece, a priest for the African Ifa religion which has similarities to Voodoo, said the placing of the birds would suggest it is part of a ritual. 'They might be wiping themselves with . the bird, letting the blood and then having to discard the body,' Reece said. He added that those who follow religions like Ifa often sacrifice birds and goats for protection or cleansing rituals. The carcasses then have to be left in a place the 'deity is calling out for' he added. Voodoo: Duane Reece, a priest of the African Ifa religion, says the birds may be part of a cleansing ritual .

"Whether it's the bound lotus or the half frog, yoga poses can get you into a tangled mess. Now a new mat aims to change that by offering users spoken and visual cues on how to best position their body – without the need for an instructor. Described as the world's first smart yoga mat, the gadget also provides feedback by sending pressure data to an app on an Android or iOS device. Scroll down for video . High-tech Yoga: Described as the world's first smart yoga mat, the gadget provides feedback on poses by sending pressure data to an app on an Android or iOS device . On the outside, the 'SmartMat' looks like an ordinary yoga mat and can be rolled up into a gym bag. But beneath its outer foam is a grid of conductive fabric placed over what is known as piezo-resistive material. This material changes its electrical resistance when pressure is applied. With the help of software, this allows the mat to know where a user is standing and how much weight is being exerted on each of its zones. It also provide audio advice on breathing technique and hand position. 'We built SmartMat because we wanted a way to receive personalised yoga instruction without having to go to an outside class or hire a private teacher,' said SmartMat Founder, Neyma Jahan. 'SmartMat synchs with and analyses each user via a unique calibration process, providing the kind of custom biofeedback once exclusive to private lessons.' Strike a pose: The 'Smartmat' takes users through a series of poses  to help determine their 'perfect pose' The Smartmat is the same size, consistency and rolls up like a 'regular yoga mat'. It connects to a smartphone or tablet using bluetooth. The device calibrates to a users body and yoga abilities to determine the correct adjustments for that individual. It's In-Class-Assist mode follows along to a users movements, recording those and offering real time adjustments either visually, via audio or both. In Home Private mode, the user follows along to the program receiving adjustments on first alignment and then balance. According to its Los-Angeles-based makers, if set-up correctly, the SmartMat can distinguish between 62 different yoga poses. A user begins by plugging in data on their weight, height and other body measurements into the mat. The gadget will then take the user through a series of poses and suggest adjustments to determine their 'perfect pose'. After this initial calibration, SmartMat will use the information to provide yoga recommendations during future sessions. Users can also teach themselves new moves through downloadable lessons, and a 'Zen mode' can be switched on to get feedback later. According to its Los-Angeles-based makers, if set-up correctly, the SmartMat can distinguish between 62 different yoga poses.

"Unsightly speakers with trailing wires are an unwelcome feature of many living rooms. But now there is an alternative that claims to be 'invisible' and able to disappear into its surroundings as the main bulk of the speaker is completely transparent. A U.S. firm has developed an ultra-thin clear acrylic speaker that will cost $350 (£215) – which is a cheaper alternative to embedding speakers into walls and does not require DIY skills either. Scroll down for video . Transparent tech: A U.S. firm has developed an ultra-thin clear acrylic speaker (pictured) that costs £215 - which is a cheaper alternative to embedding speakers into walls and does not require DIY skills either . The ‘invisible’ Clio speaker can sit directly in front of a TV without obscuring a person’s view and works with any Bluetooth tablet or smartphone. It uses a 1mm thin sheet of acrylic to create the sound and is wireless. Traditional speakers generate sound in one direction but the curved surface of the Clio model emits sound in multiple directions, according to ClearView Audio of Boston in Massachusetts. There is no grill or cover between the speaker and your ears – so that the sound is clearer than ever, it said. Traditional speakers generate sound in one direction but the curved surface (pictured) of the Clio model emits sound in multiple directions, according to ClearView Audio of Boston in Massachusetts . The speaker weighs 900 grams and is approximately nine inches tall (23cm) and 12 inches (30cm) wide. It will go on sale next month in three base colours - dark bronze, silver or charcoal. The first deliveries are expected to be shipped in May - including to the UK - and can be ordered from the company's website. Vice President of Marketing, Gene D'Ovidio, 64, said: ‘The original idea was to create a speaker from the motion of a curved membrane. ‘But the idea of a clear membrane emerged from a desire to make a speaker that would fit in front of a TV or any other monitor that would have to be clear. Spot the speaker: The device (pictured on the piano) uses a 1mm thin sheet of acrylic to create the sound and is wireless . The 'invisible' Clio speaker (pictured) can sit directly in front of a TV without obscuring a person's view and works with any Bluetooth tablet or smartphone . ‘We were driven by the desire to eliminate unattractive ""black boxes"" from the interior design of a home or office - we believe that speakers should be heard and not seen.' Mr D'Ovidio said that the company wants to give consumers the same experience if walking into a purposely designed room with speakers embedded in walls and ceilings, at a fraction of the cost. The technology used to make the sound, which is called Edge Motion, is patented by the company. The speaker weighs 900 grams and is approximately nine inches tall (23cm) and 12 inches (30cm) wide. The base comes in three colours to help it blend n further with the decor of a room . Traditional cone speakers push sound from behind, but vibrations are driven along the outside of the clear glass' thin membrane in the Clio speaker.

A nice place for a stroll: Even if you don't fancy throwing yourself off the bridge, you can just enjoy the views . Riders are strapped to a zipwire together, clipped in horizontally side by side. The ride reaches speeds of 70mph as it swoops through the air. The Skypark AJ Hackett has already successfully applied to the Guinness World Records for the site to be recognised as the longest suspension footbridge in the world. Quite the feat of construction: The bridge stretches across its wide chasm for the best part of a kilometre . Spokesman Vladislav Baranov says: 'Parts of the skypark are still under construction, but we want this to be the highest, fastest, most fun park in the world.' He adds: 'There are two heights of bungee in case people don't feel brave enough to go all the way down from the top. Do we have to jump?

"A beauty school student from Sacramento says she had to sell her car because it was being haunted by the spirit of her dead boyfriend. Deanna Stinson says she had a series on spine-chilling experiences in her pick up truck which started days after her boyfriend Alex's unexpected death. When a paranormal investigator checked the car, he recorded what the pair believe was a male voice trying to answer their questions. Haunted: Deanna Stinson believes the spirit of her dead boyfriend is in her car . Spirit world: Paranormal investigator Paul Dale Roberts and Deanna recreate how they tried to make contact with the ghost . Ms Stinson had been dating Alex for only a month in 2005 when he died of a drug overdose. Three days later she claims she had the first of several supernatural encounters with the 22-year-old. She said she was driving through Sacramento while wearing a skirt that Alex had always admired on her, when she could feel someone touching her. 'I could feel touching on my hair and on my shoulders, on my thighs, just everywhere,' she told CBS Sacramento. 'My concentration would be lost a lot of the times, but I would just pray, and then it would stop,' she added. On a couple of occasions the student became convinced she could see Alex in the rear view mirror and even in the passenger seat next to her. Spooky: Deanna says she was forced to pull over because the spirit of her dead boyfriend tried to touch her . Spirit world: Deanna Stinson and Paul Dale Roberts are both interested in paranormal activity . Connection: Deanna believes Alex is still haunting her car, but his presence led to her marrying Paul . In one encounter, she claimed that he appeared as a ghost in the back seat and began to give her a shoulder massage. 'I was starting to get freaked out and I don't like to be touched by ghostly hands, especially when I am driving,' she told the Knight Talk Radio website. Ms Stinson says she had no choice but to get rid of the pick up truck but when the feeling that she was being haunted lingered, she called in a paranormal investigator. Paul Dale Roberts, who has written several books about supernatural activity, used electronic equipment to test the truck. The 59-year-old, who married Ms Stinson earlier this month, asked the spirit of Alex a series of questions and, when he played back the recording a muffled male voice could be heard. 'He’s definitely probably not attached to his car, but he’s attached to Deanna,' Mr Roberts said. Ms Stinson says that although she has still felt the presence of Alex in her new car, she is happy for him to remain as long as he doesn't interfere with her driving.","Deanna Stinson says she was forced to buy new car because old one was possessed .

"Casey Anthony showed no signs of grief parading in a 'hot body' contest at a Florida nightclub four days after her two-year-old daughter went missing, the court heard during her sensational murder trial. In the shocking climax to the high-profile trial, the jury today accepted the claims of Anthony's defence team that Caylee drowned in the Anthony family swimming pool on June 16 . But witnesses, including Anthony's flatmates and boyfriend, revealed to the court how the single mother from Orlando carried on as normal in June 2008, showing no signs of distress, anxiety or depression and never mentioning her daughter's disappearance. Show off: Casey is seen here at a 'hot body' contest at Fusion nightclub in Orlando four days after she claims her daughter drowned . Casey Anthony poses here in a raunchy picture taken from her Facebook account . Anthony's boyfriend, Tony Lazzaro, testified that just hours after her lawyers claim that Caylee drowned, they both went to their local Blockbuster video store to rent a film. 'She was the way she was every day – happy. Happy to see me. Having a grand old time,' said Mr Lazzaro who had begun dating Anthony on June 2 after becoming friends with her on Facebook. During the month that passed between Caylee last being seen alive and her grandparents calling the police, Anthony enjoyed wild parties joining friends on nights out to local bars and clubs. On June 20, four days after Caylee drowned, Anthony went to Fusion, a restaurant and nightclub in Orlando, dressed up in a clinging blue-knit dress. 'She was in a Hot Body contest…She was partying and having a good time, drinking, dancing,' said Roy 'Clint' House, who shared an apartment with Anthony's then boyfriend, where she spent much of that month. A prosecutor asked whether Anthony had seemed worried, depressed, withdrawn, sad, angry, scared or had voiced concern about her daughter. 'No sir,' he replied. 'She seemed like a fun party girl,' said Mr House. Fellow flatmate Nathan Lezniewicz, 23, told the court: 'She always seemed like she was having a good time. She's not an introvert personality by any means.' Later that month, Anthony visiting a tattoo parlour to get Italian phrase 'Bella Vita' tattooed on her back, which means the 'good life'. Delighted: Casey Anthony shows her excitement as she is found not guilty . Friends and flatmates of her boyfriend Tony Lazzaro all concurred, saying that Anthony's demeanour never changed between when they saw her with her little girl in early June, and the period during which they later learned that Caylee had been missing. 'She seemed just the same. Nothing had changed, you know. She was happy,' Cameron Campana, 23, told the court. When the police were finally called on July 15, Anthony broke down and claimed that Caylee had been kidnapped by her nanny, who later turned out to be fictitious. Caylee was last seen on June 16, 2008, when Anthony left the family home with her daughter. But it was not until a month later that police were notified that she was missing. Drowned: Caylee Anthony, two, was said to have died in an accident in the family swimming pool on June 16, 2008 . Protection: A mounted police unit patrols the suburban neighbourhood street in front of the Anthony home . The single mother told her parents a complex series of lies for why they could not see Caylee, including that the girl was with a nanny named Zanny, that she and her daughter were spending time in Jacksonville with a rich boyfriend and that Zanny had been hospitalised after an out-of-town accident and they were spending time with her. Finally on July 15, after hearing her daughter's car had been towed, Cindy Anthony confronted her daughter and called 911 to report Caylee was missing. In a distressed call she told the operator that her granddaughter had been missing for a month and that she had found her daughter's car that day and 'it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car'. Remains: Caylee's skull and other bones, blurred, were discovered in woodland near the Anthony home in Orlando, Florida . Distressing: The court heard that Caylee's bones had been gnawed by animals before they were found . Grief: A well wisher leaves stuffed animals and candles at a makeshift memorial left on Suburban Drive, Orlando, near where Caylee's remains were found . When Anthony got on the phone, she claimed that her nanny Zenairda Fernandez-Gonzalez - who was later shown not to exist - had taken Caylee. She claimed she had not reported her missing sooner because she was trying to find her herself, which she admitted was 'stupid'. The kidnap claim triggered a nationwide search for the toddler and on October 14, 2008, Anthony was indicted for murder. Then on December 11, 2008, the search for Caylee ended when her skeletal remains were found in woodland with duct tape hanging from her skull. But the most shocking revelation came on the first day of her murder trial on May 5, when in the defence's opening statement lawyer Jose Baez dropped a bombshell - claiming that Caylee was never missing, but had accidentally drowned in the Anthony's pool on June 16. He also accused George Anthony of sexually abusing his daughter as a child, having a role in disposing of the body and bullying his daughter into keeping it all secret. Mr Anthony denied the claims. Mr Baez claimed the family's disfunctional relationship explained Anthony's behaviour after Caylee's death, which he acknowledged was 'bizarre' and 'inappropriate'.","Casey appeared in 'Hot body' bar contest just days after Caylee went missing .

"Leon Brittan died at the age of 75 following a lengthy battle with cancer. Today friends said the former Home Secretary's final days had been 'dogged by allegations' Explosive claims that Leon Brittan conspired to cover up an Establishment child sex ring are ‘wholly unjustified’, a senior peer said yesterday. Only days after he died from cancer, the Tory former home secretary was also the subject of wild allegations of ‘multiple child rape’. The second, toxic, claim was made in a newspaper yesterday by Labour MP Tom Watson, who even compared the Tory grandee to Jimmy Savile as he accused him of abusing three boys. Lord Brittan, who died last Wednesday aged 75 after a long battle with cancer, remains under investigation by Scotland Yard. He was questioned under caution last summer after a Labour activist came forward and accused him of raping her in 1967. The grandee has long been accused of failing to act on an abuse dossier passed to him by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983. Yesterday Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile said the claims were ‘based on no evidence’, adding that Lord Brittan was ‘an important political figure’ whose final months were ‘very sad’. Lord Carlile, a former counter-terrorism watchdog, highlighted how Mr Dickens repeatedly praised Lord Brittan over his response to the ‘dossier’. He said: ‘Geoffrey Dickens praised him explicitly both in the House of Commons and in correspondence. ‘Leon Brittan has been the subject of a smear campaign in the media which is wholly unjustified and based on no evidence. ‘We know now there’s a further very important point. We know now because it’s been revealed publicly that he was interviewed by the police about an alleged offence not long before he died. No action was taken on it, he was never arrested let alone charged.’ But there are mounting allegations that Lord Brittan was himself embroiled in a sick world of child abuse. Mr Watson said one alleged victim told him Lord Brittan raped him and described him as ‘as close to evil as a human being could get’. Mr Watson suggested that, as with Savile, the DJ and TV presenter who was a prolific paedophile, the former minister may have been protected by a reluctance to examine the affairs of the powerful. Lord Brittan - pictured as British Trade and Industry Secretary - with Margaret Thatcher in 1986 . Writing in the Sunday Mirror, he called on the police to investigate the claims and described those victims and witnesses he has spoken to as ‘sincere’. And he attacked those who have stood by Lord Brittan and said they do not believe the victims’ stories. Mr Watson said: ‘Their comments were a cold dismissal of those who believe it’s a travesty that Brittan will never be asked the truth; to answer questions about his conduct under oath at a public inquiry. ‘It is possible to spend a lot of time with a person and yet know nothing of their true nature.’ Speaking about the reaction to his death, he added: ‘All the glowing tributes reminded me of the media coverage immediately after Jimmy Savile’s death… . ‘Savile was protected by a media culture that worshipped at the altar of celebrity. Was Brittan protected by a misplaced sense of deference to the powerful?’ One key witness, known only as ‘Nick’, claims Lord Brittan raped and abused him more than a dozen times at an apartment in Dolphin Square near Westminster in the 1980s. Mr Watson claims two others have made similar allegations of being raped by him. In his strident statement, Mr Watson also said: ‘Leon Brittan stands accused of multiple child rape. Many others know of these allegations and chose to remain silent. I will not.’ Last week Scotland Yard said its investigation in to the 1967 rape remains ‘under review’. But it is widely believed that Lord Brittan is also under scrutiny in the separate investigation, known as Operation Middleton, into historical sex abuse. This work is far from complete, but senior officers are understood to be considering how best to reveal their findings if prosecutions cannot be brought. Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said: ‘I think the Met Police should share what information they do have on Leon Brittan so that it can help clear his name or help encourage other alleged victims to come forward.’ Senior politicians have paid tribute to Lord Brittan. David Cameron described him as a ‘dedicated public servant’. Leon Brittan abused teenage boys during sex parties which are at the heart of claims of an Establishment paedophile ring, it was claimed yesterday. The Tory peer was accused of attending the orgies at the now notorious Dolphin Square luxury apartment complex in Westminster. A key witness ‘Nick’, who has been described by police as ‘credible’, told investigative website Exaro he was raped ‘more than a dozen times’. He said Lord Brittan ‘would treat me like I was not even human’. And he added that the peer was ‘nasty, cruel, sadistic and hateful’. Dolphin Square: The scene of the orgies involving Leon Brittan, according to claims . Asked how he had identified him, Nick said: ‘Well, he told me. Not his full name. He told me that it was Leon. And it was only later in my adult life that I knew who it was.’ He alleged that Lord Brittan attacked him from the age of 11. He said he witnessed other boys, all aged under 14, being abused as well. Shocking claims : Leon Britan . Nick has been interviewed at length by Scotland Yard detectives investigating allegations of sex abuse by the rich and powerful. Last month they sensationally revealed that they found his claims of abuse, rape and even the murder of three boys to be ‘credible and true’. Lord Brittan has now been accused of being present at three venues where the alleged abuse of underage boys took place. In a separate development yesterday, a former police officer claimed he was photographed entering a second sex den. The Tory former Cabinet minister, who was also a former European Commission vice-president, was said to have been caught on camera during a surveillance operation focusing on rent boys around King’s Cross in North London. Police suspected young men were being trafficked around the capital and preyed upon in rented flats and garages by groups of men. And a schoolboy has claimed he was repeatedly molested at the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London, by a man called ‘Uncle Leon’. The youngster made the comments in a police interview in 1982 but they were left out of his formal statement, despite being witnessed by officers and a social worker. The mystery omission, suspected to refer to Lord Brittan, came to light when the Met began an investigation in 2013 into activities at the guest house, where a VIP paedophile ring is said to have operated.","Alleged victim 'Nick' claims ex-Home Secretary raped him a dozen times .

"Google has launched what it describes as its most-advanced voice search to date. The new features are available on iOS from today, having been previously available on select Android devices and the Google Chrome browser. Google Voice Search aims to understand the context of requests, allowing follow-up questions to be asked on the same topic. This means someone asking about the current weather in Birmingham, for example, could then ask: 'How do I get there?' - without reminding the device which city they are referring to. Scroll down for video . Google's new Voice Search app is available on iOS from today, having been previously available on select Android devices and the Chrome browser. Google Voice Search aims to understand the context of requests, allowing follow-up questions to be asked on the same topic, such as humpback whales, pictured . The answer will be given aloud on the smartphone if it is short and succinct. Google technology expert Michael Valvo said: 'Whether you're plotting the easiest public transport route across London, trying to order a drink in Paris en Francais, or cheating at a pub quiz, Google is there to help you get the information you need, fast.' Its other features include giving directions based on information from live traffic updates, and setting reminders based on a location. This could allow the user to be alerted to take the bins out when they get home, or to pick up a certain item when they get to their local supermarket, for example. It will also allow smartphone users to ask Google to identify a song that is being played, similar to how Shazam works - and will then give the user the option of buying that song in the Google Play store. Google claims the new voice search is faster than its nearest rival, Apple's Siri, and also provides users with more detailed answers. Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak even admitted earlier this week, during an interview with the BBC, he thought the Android search was superior to Siri's. Mr Valvo added: 'This is Google's most advanced voice search ever, which is now available to the majority of smartphone users in the UK with the release day of the latest Google search app on iOS. 'It has the ability to understand the context of a conversation and spoken directions that even take into account traffic conditions.' The voice search technology builds on the changes Google made to written searches, announced in September. When you search Google it no longer just searches for individual keywords; it can now respond to questions and statements in the same way a human might, by looking at the whole query - even if it doesn't have an exact answer. The new features of Google's improved Voice Search were showcased in central London in a specially-designed Google House, pictured, which demonstrated how the search could be used in different contexts, such as in the kitchen or while planning a holiday .

"The majestic transformation of a star has been revealed in a stunning time-lapse of a stellar explosion 20,000 light years away. The animation, spanning four years, documents a huge explosion emanating from V838 Monocerotis – a red star located in the constellation Monoceros. Before it exploded, V838 had grown to become one of the largest stars ever observed by astronomers, producing 600,000 times more light than our own sun. Scroll down for video . The animation, which spans images taken over four years, documents a huge explosion emanating from V838 Monocerotis – a red star located in the constellation Monoceros . A light echo is light from a stellar explosion echoing off dust surrounding the star. V838 . Monocerotis produced enough energy in a brief flash to illuminate . surrounding dust, like a spelunker taking a flash picture of the walls . of an undiscovered cavern. The star presumably ejected the illuminated dust shells in previous outbursts. Light from the latest outburst travels to the dust and then is reflected to Earth. Because . of this indirect path, the light arrives at Earth months after light . from the star that travelled directly toward Earth. As it burst, V838 created an expanding light echo that lit up the cosmic dust surrounding it, creating some of the most stunning images seen by the Hubble telescope to date. The time-lapse uses a series of images captured by Hubble between 2002 and 2006, when V838 Monocerotis produced a stellar flash so brilliant that scientists had never seen anything like it before. As it burst, V838 created an expanding light echo that lit up the cosmic dust surrounding it, creating some of the most stunning images seen by Hubble to date . A stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas and novas typically expel matter out into space, often obscuring them from view. While the animation appears to show V838 expel material into space, what it is actually showing is an outwardly moving 'light echo' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity. According to Nasa, during echoes, light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star. Structures that resemble whirlpools in the star are noticeable in the time-lapse, and may have been produced by the effects of magnetic fields in the space between the stars.

According to Nasa, in a light echo, light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star . Scientists still don’t know what caused the explosion. They originally predicted that astronomers were watching a supernova or the thermal pulse of a dying star. But these theories have since been dismissed after discovering the V838 was likely a young star. A paper with contributions from the US Naval Observatory, the University of Arizona and the European Space Agency concluded: 'When combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behaviour, these characteristics indicate that V838 Mon represents a hitherto unknown type of stellar outburst, for which we have no completely satisfactory physical explanation.' V838 Mon lies about 20,000 light years away toward the constellation of the unicorn (hence the name Monoceros), while the light echo in the image spans about six light years in diameter.
