"(CNN) -- X-ray data from NASA's MESSENGER probe points to high levels of magnesium and sulfur on the surface of the planet Mercury, suggesting its makeup is far different from that of other planets, scientists say. The unmanned orbiter has been beaming back data from the first planet for a year and a half. Readings from its X-ray spectrometer point to a planet whose northern volcanic plains formed through upwellings of rocks more exotic than those often found on the Earth, the Moon or Mars, said Shoshana Weider, a researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. ""Before this MESSENGER mission, a lot of people assumed it was very like the Moon -- it's dark, it's grey,"" Weider said. But while the Moon's surface formed when light materials floated to the top of an ocean of molten rock, the low level of calcium on Mercury indicates that didn't happen there. ""This gives us clues to the kind of precursor materials that accreted to form Mercury, in an extremely oxygen-poor environment,"" Weider said. A short history of the Space Shuttle Endeavor . The concentration of sulfur on the surface is about 10 times that seen on Earth, she said. And while Mercury's iron core ""makes up a huge amount of the planet,"" very little is found at the surface. The northern region of volcanic plains differs significantly from the surrounding portion of Mercury, where the surface -- as dated by the number of craters -- is about a billion years older, Weider said. The results were published in the latest issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research, a peer-reviewed publication of the American Geophysical Union. Weider and her co-authors studied 205 different readings from the spectrometer to produce their results. MESSENGER -- an acronym for the Mercury Surface Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging mission -- has been orbiting Mercury since March 2011. It's only the second spacecraft to reach the planet and the first to circle it. It's about 5% the size of Earth and revolves around the sun every 88 days. It rotates very slowly -- once every 58 Earth days -- and the surface temperature on the day side can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (425 C), according to NASA.

"(CNN) -- To say that I am upset by the copycat violent protests spreading around the Arab and Muslim world would be an understatement. I want to protest against the protesters. The mindless and criminal actions of a few in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen and elsewhere, which have already led to the deaths of innocents, threaten to do a great deal of harm and seem never to make a sensible point. Like many other Muslims, I suspect, I have wrestled with the most appropriate response to that 14-minute trailer of trash produced by extremist, criminal -- yes, the ""producer"" apparently has a criminal record -- filmmakers in California. I have come down on the side of sanity. Opinion: In Yemen, protests mask diverse views on anti-Islam video . For sure, as a Muslim, I am offended by those who recklessly and purposely denigrate my faith and those who share my faith. Certainly, some of the protesters represent the unemployed, the abused and the just plain forgotten in Arab and Islamic states that have been ruled by autocrats enjoying the patronage of Western governments. It is also an obvious point for anyone living in this part of the world that virulent anti-Americanism is a driving force for what is happening today. U.S. policy in the region has bequeathed a fatal breakdown in trust between successive American administrations and Arabs and Muslims. An unjust and illegal Iraq war, a ""war on terror"" that spawned a whole new drone industry, Washington's double standards in promoting human rights in the region and its unflagging support for Israel in spite of an expanding occupation in Palestine have all contributed to that legacy. As Arab states undergo a historic transformation, this breakdown in trust is having a devastating effect as the Obama administration wrestles with the right thing to do. Arabs, with the notable exception of most Libyans, give the U.S. very little credit for what it is doing and complain, as in Syria and Bahrain, about what it is not. But absolutely none of the above should justify the violent protests sweeping the globe. Instead, the violence of the protests has undermined our legitimate pain in the eyes of billions across the globe. The protests have reinforced those who seek to portray Muslims as wide-eyed extremists and Islam as an inherently intolerant, violent faith. News: Free speech or incitement? French magazine runs cartoons of Mohammed . Worse still, they have detracted the attention of the world from the continuing slaughter in Syria. Last month was reportedly the most violent on record in all the Middle East's recent conflicts -- more so even than Iraq at the height of its civil war. Many Syrians on social media and elsewhere are asking themselves, rightfully, where are the protesters when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his regime continue to kill more than 150 men, women and children a day? And when his supporters continue to chant ""There is no God but Bashar""? If we are not careful, these protests could encourage the world to forget the so-called Arab Spring and turn away from the struggle for dignity, justice and opportunity that has driven people to demand change. Surely, that is the hope of their biggest supporters -- a mix of former regime elements, al Qaeda offshoots, other jihadists and Salafi political parties. It is no coincidence that the protests first took root in weakened states, such as Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, which are in the early stages of democratic transitions. While not all the protesters may know it, their actions are helping those who want to derail those transitions. That is why new governments in these countries must show zero tolerance for the violent challenge posed by these protesters. As they must surely know, they are engaged in a battle for the soul of their societies. There must be no hesitation, no equivocation and no nuance in dealing with such violent aggression. In particular, President Mohamed Morsy of Egypt, an Islamist leader from the Muslim Brotherhood party, has to demonstrate the clear moral leadership that is required to steer his country to calmer waters. For many, his response to date and that of the Muslim Brotherhood has been troubling, illustrating both a lack of understanding of the United States and a desire to appease the demonstrators. It has shown a lack of confidence. Morsy must realize that he is the president of Egypt, not simply a leader of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party -- from which he actually resigned on taking office just a few months ago. The economy and international reputation of his country is suffering great damage, which he must urgently reverse. Although opinions about him are sharply divided, Morsy has the legitimacy to rally his people. He has the responsibility to insist on safeguarding the rule of law, without restricting new democratic freedoms. News: Why video upset so many Muslims . The protesters must realize that we cannot continue to go through this kind of turmoil every time an ill-meaning hate-peddler decides to mock our faith. The idiocy and recklessness of the people behind ""Innocence of Muslims"" are without question. Sadly, those who continue to protest violently against them are acting just as stupidly. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Salman Shaikh.","Salman Shaikh: Violent protests of anti-Islam film have killed people and are pointless .
Shaikh thinks the film, U.S. policy, Iraq war have justifiably angered the Mideast .
But protests bolster worst Muslim stereotypes, he says, detract from issues like Syria .
Shaikh: Anti-democracy elements behind protests; Arab leaders must denounce them ."
"(CNN) -- I've been given a lot of credit for opening up the airwaves to frank sexual material, but I doubt without Helen Gurley Brown's pioneering articles in Cosmopolitan that I could have gotten away with as much as I did. Hugh Hefner showed a lot of naked women in Playboy, and the Playboy Advisor did offer some advice on sexual functioning (in between answering questions about cars and stereos, but men weren't having quite the same difficulties finding sexual satisfaction that women were back in the '60s. The sexual revolution was upon us and young people were having more sex, but that didn't mean young women were having better sex. Certainly they weren't learning how to have good sex in the few sex ed classes that were around. Discussions about pleasure weren't part of the curriculum, that's for sure. And if most of their friends were as clueless as they were, they weren't learning much from them. (Some women can climax very easily but the majority of women cannot have an orgasm from intercourse alone and it's those women who need to be taught what to do.) News: Former Cosmo editor Gurley Brown dead at 90 . The men they were dating knew even less about how to please a woman than the women did. So in between the silly quizzes and the puff pieces on fashion and the latest hairstyles, Helen Gurley Brown was sneaking in, at least in the early days, real information about how women could find sexual satisfaction. And the women were lapping it up, which is why eventually the articles about sex made their way onto the cover pages and the titillating titles became a mainstay of the magazine's success. As Cosmo's influence grew, spreading around the world, Helen's crusade to teach women how to fully enjoy sex had a worldwide impact. Helen is known for having cracked the glass ceiling as editor of Cosmopolitan, but she should be given credit for helping every women in the working world because of the frank way she covered sex in her publication. Thanks to what they were reading in Cosmo, women discovered that they could have sexual satisfaction, but only if they took more control of what was happening during sexual encounters with their male partner. As they learned to ask for what they wanted and needed -- sexual satisfaction in the bedroom -- it wasn't going to be long before they took more control in the boardroom as well. Video: Helen Gurley Brown: I'm a devout feminist . Knowing that you can control your own body gives you a level of self-confidence that helps in every endeavor. If you are sexually frustrated, if you have doubts about your own body, if you see two people having sex in the movies, as unrealistic as movie sex is, and say to yourself, ""Why can't I do that?"" then when faced with men at work who put you down and act in an overbearing manner, you'll naturally back down. How can you show strength if you can't even manage something as basic as having sex? But once a woman discovers how to have great sex, and takes charge and teaches her man what she needs, then the next morning when she's on her way to the office she'll have a lot more confidence in her own abilities and that confidence will help her succeed. There have been many women throughout history who were good at getting what they wanted by using their bodies. Their sexual wiles earned for them a degree of power that otherwise would have been unattainable. And while possibly some of them were actually enjoying sex, they didn't have to, as women can fake it -- and I'm certain many weren't, at least not with the man they were milking for the better things in life. What Helen Gurley Brown taught women was how to use their bodies not to give someone else pleasure but to give themselves pleasure, and that is a tremendous contribution for which I thank her on behalf of all the women who are now orgasmic and might never have been without her pioneering efforts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Ruth Westheimer.","Dr. Ruth Westheimer says Helen Gurley Brown's Cosmopolitan sex articles were pioneering .

"Zhouqu County, China (CNN) -- Our journey started with a 16-hour drive, most of it on windy, rugged mountain roads. But we could only drive so far. As we hiked the last four kilometers to the landslide, we passed villagers trekking out single file. Most were carrying their lives on their back, some with a child on their hip, even a few people were barefoot. Then we started seeing bodies, body after dead body, wrapped in blankets on makeshift stretchers. Some were carried by soldiers, some by villagers, all headed to the morgue, a parking lot designated on the side of the road. That night, I settled in for an uneasy sleep in the car with my producer Wen-Chun Fan and photographer Brad Olson, knowing it was just a preview of the devastation we would witness. After crisscrossing floodwaters, and dodging goat carcasses and mudflows, we reached the site of the actual slide. Several stories of mud and rock stretched down from the mountain that had unleashed this fury. In every direction were soldiers heaving stone after stone and families digging with picks, shovels and their bare hands. The biggest hazard was the sludge, which Wen-Chun Fan dubbed ""quick-mud."" If we stepped in the wrong spot, we could easily be swallowed up. There was heavy machinery stranded in the deep mud. We carefully navigated a network of stones and unsteady planks to reach the survivors. One woman said she was digging for a family of eight. A couple lost their parents and two sons. Another man told us he lost everyone and didn't even have a pair of chopsticks to eat with. After we finished a series of live shots, the sun seemed to get hotter. Our heavy bags, filled with gear and supplies, seemed heavier. We ran out of water. One woman offered me a sip of her water, apparently the only bottle she had. When I refused, she tore off a piece of the cardboard box she was sitting on and handed it to me. She didn't have a home and had probably lost a few family members, but she wanted to make sure I'd have a place to sit. Sitting down was a relief, but it gave me too much time to think, look around and stare at the faces of these people who had lost so much. Every so often, rescuers would reach another dead body and family members would break out in a chorus of wails and screams. Then we heard screams of what may be called joy. A team of People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers had found signs of life. They pulled a 52-year-old disabled man from the wreckage. He had been trapped for 60 hours. I couldn't see his face, but I saw him move, and knew he was alive. The celebration was brief. It was the only successful rescue that day. The next day we thought we might have already seen the worst, until we arrived at Yueyuan village, or what was left of it. The entire village was smothered beneath a sweeping mud plain. There was barely any evidence that three hundred homes once stood there. Some people didn't know exactly where to start. One man said he thought he was digging into his brother's bedroom, but still had found no evidence of a structure. Another man, Mr. Li, had already found his wife's body, but was still looking for the remains of his two sons. He drew a map for us, room by room, speculating about where they might have been when the landslide happened. A pile of blankets, bowls and a lamp shade were all he had left. He said he hadn't been able to bury his wife yet - the town had run out of coffins. It was a journey filled with images we would all rather forget but will probably always remember. When we passed the morgue two days later, many bodies had been partially unwrapped by family members hoping to find their loved ones.","""The we started seeing bodies, body after dead body,"" Emily Chang .

"(CNN) -- We don't yet know how heavy a blow Hurricane Isaac will deliver to the Gulf Coast when it hits. But mindful of the devastation that Hurricane Katrina left in its wake, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi have declared states of emergency and evacuations have begun. Public officials and emergency managers are getting good at getting people out of harm's way. Unfortunately, where official plans are likely to fall short is in helping evacuees to quickly return to their storm-damaged communities and get back on their feet. The kind of levee system failure we saw with Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 is not likely to be repeated with this storm, given the $14 billion investment that the Army Corps of Engineers is close to completing. Harder hit will be the people along the Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama coastlines and in low-lying inland areas with no levee protection. But it's making communities safe enough for residents to return to quickly that is so important, because packing up and running away from the weather is so expensive. The average Gulf Coast family fleeing the storm will have to dole out and estimated $250 to $300 a day for food and lodging. With the economy still foundering, and the unemployment rate for most of the Gulf Coast region still above 8%, plenty of folks have no savings to pay for shelter or even to fill the gas tank for the drive inland. Those who must leave their jobs behind will have smaller paychecks to draw on when the credit card bills arrive at the end of the month. The longer they must stay away, the greater the financial setback they will face. While the media satellite trucks are likely to leave shortly after Isaac passes, plenty of hardship stories will be left to tell once Gulf Coast evacuees are allowed to return to their homes. Residents will almost certainly face the same kinds of challenges they experienced seven years ago in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Our elected officials all recognize the high political cost of failing to respond to a disaster as it unfolds, and will do whatever it takes to earn good marks. But despite the painful experiences the Gulf region has endured in the aftermath of recent storms, the path to recovery will still be a rocky one. Federal, state and local government officials have not resolved many of the bureaucratic and insurance-related issues that slow restoring services, paying out legitimate claims and making repairs. Damage assessments have to be made and questions about liability and coverage have to be resolved for homes and businesses that are destroyed. In public spaces, cash-strapped agencies have to determine who is responsible for clearing debris and cleaning up spills of hazardous materials. To date, too little attention has been paid to streamlining these processes. When government falls short in meeting the immediate needs of victims, nonprofit and faith-based relief organizations often step in to fill the void. But long before Isaac started churning through the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, relief organizations throughout the Gulf Coast were already under severe stress, trying to serve nearly one-fourth of the region's residents who have a chronic need for assistance. And with charitable giving down below 2007 levels, churches and small community-based organizations have had to cut back on staff and make painful cuts in the social services they provide. What this means is that the ultimate safety net for the neediest populations may be one of the victims of Isaac. These organizations will require early and substantial outside assistance. The storm will provide yet another vivid display of nature's menacing capacity for destruction and disruption as Republicans gather in Tampa, Florida, and a few days before Democrats descend on Charlotte, North Carolina. Organizers for both national conventions have promised programs that will offer up contrasting views of the role of government. Isaac will provide a reminder that managing messy real world challenges does not lend itself to simple formulas favored by political partisans. When it comes to assuring the safety and well-being of Americans, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Responding to and recovering from disasters require individual and local resilience on the one hand, and capable and competent government at all levels -- local, state, and federal -- on the other. Throughout this election season our political parties have been busy highlighting what divides us. But disasters have a way of teaching lessons that should unite us. When catastrophic events happen, it is the decisions and actions of local officials and everyday people that are key to survival. But when it comes to planning evacuations, maintaining levees, and supporting the speedy recovery of communities leveled by a storm -- government matters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Flynn and Sean Burke.","Writers: Isaac evacuations start; officials have gotten good at getting people out .

"(CNN) -- CNN asked two contributors, both steeped in the political arts, to give advice to the candidates for Wednesday night's debate. Here are their thoughts: . Paul Begala's advice for Mitt Romney: . A quarter-century ago, George F. Will wrote that in a meeting with atomic scientists, President Ronald Reagan quoted Jack London: . ""I would rather be ashes than dust, . I would rather my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze, . Than it should be stifled in dry rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, . With every atom of me in magnificent glow, . Than a sleepy and permanent planet."" The Gipper followed that powerful poetry with some classic Reagan common sense. He said the Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler was asked what London's lines meant. Stabler replied: ""Throw deep."" How to watch, Clip and Share the debate . That should be Mitt Romney's strategy in tonight's debate: Throw deep. Here's the problem: the one time in his cautious, careful, risk-averse candidacy that Romney gambled, he lost. Putting Paul Ryan on the ticket has been a disaster. Ryan's budget ideas -- voucherizing Medicare, privatizing Social Security, gutting education and giving tax breaks to the rich -- are toxic. The Romney-Ryan budget plan has cemented Romney's image as Gordon Gekko on a bad day; Thurston Howell III on a good one. Opinion: How will debates sway the undecideds? Romney's aides are right when they tell the press a debate is a series of moments, and they are wise to try to craft some moments. But they are fools for telling The New York Times: ""(Romney's) strategy includes luring the president into appearing smug or evasive about his responsibility for the economy."" First, let me assure you our president reads The New York Times and has almost certainly deployed his Spock-like mind on avoiding smugness or evasion. Any strategy that relies on your opponent to err is a hope, not a strategy. Instead of hoping for President Obama to be a jerk, Romney should surprise us by being human. He should acknowledge the obvious: that his party made a hash of things the last time they ran the economy: squandering the surplus, generating trillions in debt, deregulating Wall Street, waging war on the national credit card. Opinion: Debate is all about trust for Romney . By pushing off the GOP's errors, Romney would build credibility as a sensible moderate. Then, and only then, he could be believable when he attacks the Obama economic record. Breaking with the failed orthodoxy of his own party's past was something Ronald Reagan was capable of. But Mitt Romney is no Ronald Reagan. And he's certainly no Ken Stabler. Romney was not a quarterback, throwing deep. He was, and remains, a cheerleader, furiously praising his team's efforts. Even when they have demonstrably failed. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, is senior adviser to Priorities USA Action, the biggest super PAC favoring President Barack Obama's re-election. Begala was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. Opinion: Candidates, stop vying to be debate underdog . Alex Castellanos' advice for Barack Obama: . Mr. President, my advice for you in your debate tomorrow: Have a cigarette. No, seriously. If I were your advisor, I'd urge you to remember that you are the president, and we only have one of those. A president's stature is hard to match. Don't throw it away by becoming a political attack dog. Yes, you need a good offense or Romney will put you on defense, which you don't want. Hey, you've got a lot that needs defending! But keep your famous cool and make Romney come up to your level. Eatocracy: How the candidates should eat before the debates . Remember, a tie goes to the incumbent. Mitt Romney has to make the case for change or Americans will keep what they've got. The pressure is on him. Keep your chin down. No, literally. You tend to get a bit arrogant sometimes. At times, you've even bragged about your modesty. Debate night is not the time to repeat your suggestion that you might be one of the four greatest presidents in American history. Opinion: Why debate is crucial for Obama, too . Quote Bill Clinton. I know this one sticks in your craw: You don't believe Clinton is in your same league. Remember, however, that his speech at the Democratic convention wasn't just an endorsement, it was a campaign plan. Follow it. Tell America that Clinton was right, things are getting better and your priority for the next 4 years is reducing the deficit. Give voters a signal that you won't need the Democratic Party's left wing after you are re-elected. Let the center know you may have fooled around with crazy spending your first term, but if re-elected, you'll be faithful, live on the family budget and settle down at home with them.

"Tampa (CNN) -- It was supposed to be Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's night. But instead of basking in the afterglow of what many called a solid acceptance speech, the Romney campaign is now forced to deal with the aftermath of Clint Eastwood's rambling ""empty chair"" routine at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night. In case you missed it, the octogenarian delivered a 12-minute ad lib where he unleashed a string of criticisms on an invisible President Barack Obama sitting in an empty chair on stage. In the process, the actor/director-turned-politician stole Romney's thunder on a night when the Massachusetts governor was supposed to be the headliner. And that's not good, political watchers say. ""I thought the idea of an old man talking to a chair was a little weird. The bad part of what happened yesterday is that Clint Eastwood in his own way upstaged Mitt Romney,"" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. Given the narrow window before the Democratic National Convention -- which begins on Tuesday -- Eastwood's performance and the ensuing backlash on social media stole valuable time that the Romney campaign could have used to dominate the media cycle. ""I can't decide if it was amazingly clever or just crazy,"" said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department. ""Twenty-five percent of it is going to be taken up with the Clint Eastwood speech because it's more interesting."" Laughter, then confusion . When Eastwood walked on stage and began his Obama routine, the convention hall erupted in laughter and applause. Then his performance went viral. There were comments from everyone -- befuddled college kids and armchair pundits as well as snarky replies from celebrities. ""Tomorrow you'll know Romney hit it out of the park when the media spends its time talking about Eastwood,"" responded conservative radio host Erick Erickson, who is also a CNN contributor. The Twitter handle ""@InvisibleObama"" popped up within minutes of Eastwood's address, had more than 20,000 followers within an hour and has had more than 45,000 followers in the past 24 hours. ""I remember when anything was possible. Like 'invisible presidents,'"" said one tweet from that account. However, @InvisibleObama has been so popular that visitors to the page have been greeted throughout the day with a message that said ""Account Suspended."" Ironically, Twitter accidentally suspended the account likely because an unusual amount of ""@"" replies -- mentions about the account online -- triggered automatic spam filters. While Twitter won't comment on specific accounts, @InvisibleObama appears to be sporadically up and running. No laughing matter . But with just 67 days before Election Day, such distractions are no laughing matter, said CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger. ""I think it was rambling and I think it was a real mistake by the Romney campaign. I don't understand how they could really let that happen,"" Borger said after the speech. ""I mean, you can't exactly give him the hook when he's -- when he's on the stage, but you have to set parameters."" Romney adviser: Eastwood a 'great messenger' Senior Romney campaign strategist Stuart Stevens downplayed the notion that Eastwood's ""improv"" would be a distraction to the candidate's message. ""The crowd loved it,"" Stevens said, adding that Romney had been backstage laughing along with the audience. ""He thought it was funny."" ""For him to go out there and to say that there's a need to change presidents and that he supports Mitt Romney, and talk about 23 million people out of work as he did, and talk about when someone doesn't do their job you need to change, that's a powerful message,"" Stevens said. ""He's a great messenger. The guy is an American treasure."" The U.S. Labor Department, says there are 12.8 million unemployed people, not 23 million. Eastwood, a longtime Republican, endorsed Romney at an Idaho fundraiser at the beginning of August, where he told reporters that he was backing the GOP presidential candidate ""because I think the country needs a boost somewhere."" He endorsed Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election.Time Magazine humor columnist Joel Stein weighed in Friday on Eastwood's unscripted address on CNN's ""Starting Point"" with Soledad O'Brien. ""I've been to eight conventions, that is the best moment I've ever been to at a convention,"" Stein said. Directed at an empty chair, Stein wonders how the Romney campaign allowed the speech to happen. ""They're such a scripted group. ... I'd love to hear the pitch that he made where everyone said, 'Yes, let's do that,'"" Stein said. ""You only have a few opportunities in these campaigns to get your message out,"" said Ryan Lizza, Washington correspondent for The New Yorker. ""And we're all sitting here talking about a somewhat crazy moment by Clint Eastwood rather than what was in Mitt Romney's speech."" ""I'm not sure it really spoke to the critical issues,"" added Democratic Congresswoman Kathy Castor of Florida. ""It was a light moment."" Politicians and others stealing the spotlight or becoming political distractions is nothing new. Recently, several prominent Republicans have called on Rep. Todd Akin to drop out of the Missouri Senate race after the congressman made statements referring to ""legitimate rape,"" saying that the GOP candidate had become a distraction and liability in the tightly-contested race. Van Jones, who some say became a distraction himself just before the former Obama administration green jobs czar left the White House in controversy when conservatives linked him to past liberal political statements, offered Eastwood a bit of advice on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer on Friday. ""I feel his pain. I've been that guy,"" Jones said. ""My advice is, remember, it gets better. It gets better. Tomorrow will come."" CNN political producer Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","Actor Clint Eastwood delivered a 12-minute ad lib to an empty chair during the closing night of the Republican convention .
Some thought the routine was funny, while others called it bizarre .

"London (CNN) -- Extremist Islamic cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri and four other men departed England on Friday night destined for the United States, hours after the High Court in London ended a years-long legal battle by ruling the men could be extradited ""immediately."" Two planes left the British Air Force base Mildenhall with al-Masri, Khaled al-Fawwaz, Adel Abdul Bary, Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan so they could face trial in the United States, Home Secretary Theresa May said in a statement. ""We have worked tirelessly -- alongside the U.S. authorities, the police and the prison service -- to put plans in place so that tonight these men could be handed over within hours of the court's decision,"" May said. ""It is right that these men, who are all accused of very serious offenses, will finally face justice."" Earlier Friday, Judge John Thomas ruled that the British court's decision authorizing the extradition of the men could not be appealed and said it ""may proceed immediately."" The charges against al-Masri include conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 Westerners in Yemen, and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon in 1999. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. The UK Home Office earlier welcomed the High Court decision, and May said in her statement ""that these men ... used every available opportunity to frustrate and delay the extradition process over many years."" The U.S. Embassy in London said it was ""pleased"" by the court's ruling. ""All of these defendants will be guaranteed the same rights provided to American citizens charged with crimes in the U.S. They will be afforded a full opportunity to challenge the evidence against them in U.S. courts,"" an embassy statement said. The suspects' lawyers had sought to persuade Thomas and a second senior judge to prevent the extradition on medical and human rights grounds. It had already been approved by British courts, the European Court of Human Rights and Britain's home secretary. Thomas said the judges are satisfied that the European court had not fallen into error ""and was justified in drawing the conclusion that it did."" It was ""unacceptable"" that extradition proceedings should take so long, he said. They should last ""months, not years,"" he said. The five men had taken every possible effort to prevent their extradition, he added. The legal process in the case of al-Fawwaz and Bary has lasted 14 years.

In a statement read out on his behalf outside the court, Ahmad -- who has been detained without trial since 2004 -- claimed a moral win. ""Today I have lost my eight-year and two-month battle against extradition. I would like to thank all those over the years who supported me and my family: lawyers, politicians, journalists and members of the public from all walks of life,"" it said. ""By exposing the fallacy of the UK's extradition arrangements with the U.S., I leave with my head held high having won the moral victory."" His father, Ashfaq Ahmad, said the UK police, prosecutors and judiciary had ""colluded to implement a pre-determined decision which was made in Washington."" He added: ""We will never abandon our struggle for justice and the truth will eventually emerge of what will be forever remembered as a shameful chapter in the history of Britain."" Read more: Court clears way for cleric Abu Hamza's extradition . The ruling followed a three-day last-ditch hearing this week. Lawyers for al-Masri told the court their client suffers from deteriorating mental health and was unfit to plead. However, the judges dismissed that argument in Friday's ruling. ""There is nothing to suggest it would be unjust or oppressive to order his extradition,"" Thomas wrote. The cases of Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan are both linked to a website called azzam.com, which U.S. prosecutors say was run by the two men to support terrorism around the world. Meanwhile, Al-Fawwaz and Bary are accused of being al Qaeda associates of Osama bin Laden in London during the 1990s. Lawyers for al-Fawwaz presented evidence, including some arising from an interview by British intelligence officers with an al Qaeda informer, which they say discredits the case against him.

Presenting medical reports, lawyers for Bary said he had a deteriorating mental illness, making him unfit for detention in a high-security Supermax prison, where he is expected to be held if sent to the United States. But in his ruling, Thomas said there was a clear prima facie case against both Bary and al-Fawwaz. He also dismissed the medical argument put forward by Bary's lawyer against extradition, saying: ""It is clear to us that there has been no material change in the psychological condition of Abdul Bary."" Lawyers for Ahmad and Ahsan presented what they said was fresh evidence to support their calls for the two men to be charged with similar terrorism-supporting offenses in Britain, rather than have them face trial in the United States. The U.S. and British governments strongly contested the five suspects' submissions. Lawyers for the British government described the arguments as an abuse of the legal process. Al-Masri is one of the highest-profile radical Islamic figures in Britain, where he was already sentenced to seven years for inciting racial hatred at his north London mosque and other terrorism-related charges. Born in Egypt in 1958, he traveled to Britain to study before gaining citizenship through marriage in the 1980s. A one-time nightclub bouncer in London's Soho district, al-Masri -- also known as Mustafa Kamal Mustafa -- has said he lost both hands and one eye while fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He often wore a hook in place of one hand. In 1997, al-Masri became the imam of a north London mosque, where his hate-filled speeches attacking the West began to attract national attention and followers, including Richard Reid, the so-called ""shoe bomber"" who attempted to blow up a Miami-bound passenger airplane three months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Al-Masri has called the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center ""a towering day in history"" and described bin Laden as ""a good guy and a hero."" He also described the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003 as ""punishment from Allah"" because the astronauts were Christian, Hindu and Jewish. Al-Masri faces 11 charges in U.S. courts. ""As in the UK, legal counsel will be provided at the expense of the U.S. government if the defendants do not have the resources to pay themselves,"" a U.S. Embassy briefing note on the extradition said. ""The U.S.-UK Extradition Treaty also forbids use of the death penalty for anyone extradited from the UK.""

"(CNN) -- The desperate hunt for a 5-year-old girl abducted in Wales entered its fourth day Thursday, with hundreds of police officers, volunteers and mountain rescue workers combing a rural area for any trace of April Jones. Police continue to question a man arrested on suspicion of her abduction but said they urgently need help from the public to trace his movements during the crucial hours after April was snatched from a street Monday. Mark Bridger, 46, remains in police custody and will be questioned again Thursday, said Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, of Dyfed-Powys Police. A team of officers is working around the clock to try to piece together Bridger's movements between Monday evening and his arrest Tuesday afternoon, Bevan said, using forensic analysis and witness statements. But, he said, more help is still needed from people who may have seen or spoken with Bridger at that time. ""We are appealing for anyone who has had contact with Mark; we don't have the complete picture yet,"" Bevan said. British Prime Minister David Cameron added his voice Thursday to the plea for information made by April's family, an unusual intervention by the country's leader in an ongoing police search. ""My heart goes out to April Jones's family. I appeal for anyone who saw or heard anything to talk to the police,"" he said via his official Twitter feed. Speaking at Downing Street, Cameron also mentioned the extra concern prompted by the news that April has cerebral palsy, a condition his late son Ivan also suffered. The girl's abduction as she played with a friend on a street near her home in Machynlleth, mid-Wales, has shocked the small, close-knit community -- and made headlines across the United Kingdom. There has been no trace of the pretty brown-haired child since she was seen Monday evening, climbing into a vehicle that then drove off. April's mother, Coral Jones, made an emotional televised plea for help Wednesday. ""It has been 36 hours since our April was taken from us,"" she said, breaking down in tears. ""There must be someone out there who knows where she is and can help the police find her. ""We are desperate for any news -- April is only 5 years old. Please, please help us find her."" Local volunteers have joined police and rescue teams in searching the town and surrounding area, a task made more difficult by poor weather, flooding rivers and hilly terrain. Police said Wednesday that the search was focused on more than 20 different areas, including houses, outbuildings, river banks and open countryside. ""The geography is very challenging and everyone is working in a hostile environment -- by that I mean the terrain is difficult, waterlogged, working near to flooded rivers with the potential for mine shafts and unstable ground,"" police Superintendent Ian John said. Police dogs, coast guard teams, kayakers and mountain rescue specialists have been called in to assist in the search.","Police say they will question suspect Mark Bridger again .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The parents of missing Madeleine McCann have accepted £550,000 ($1.1 million) libel damages and an apology over stories published in two British newspapers that alleged they were involved in the disappearance or death of the girl. The front pages of the Daily Express and the Daily Star newspapers featuring apologies to Kate and Gerry McCann. In a statement read by the couple's spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, outside the High Court in London on Wednesday, the McCanns said they were ""pleased that Express Newspapers have today admitted the utter falsity of the numerous grotesque and grossly defamatory allegations that their titles published."" The McCanns accepted the damages and the couple said the money will go towards the Find Madeleine campaign. ""As part of our settlement, Express Newspapers have also agreed to pay damages, by way of a donation of £550,000, to the Fund that was established to help find Madeleine. We feel it entirely appropriate that the search for Madeleine will now benefit directly out of the wrongs committed against us as her parents."" The Daily Express and Daily Star, both owned by Express Newspapers, printed an apology on the front page of their Wednesday editions apologizing to Kate and Gerry McCann for suggesting the couple was responsible for the death of their daughter. ""Kate and Gerry McCann: Sorry,"" read the headlines. The newspapers said there was no evidence to back up a series of articles they printed alleging the parents had a role in their daughter's disappearance or death. ""Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance,"" the newspapers wrote. Both papers said they had paid ""substantial"" sums to Madeleine's Fund as a way of expressing their regret. The fund is a nonprofit company that says it was set up to help find Madeleine, support her parents and bring to justice anyone who played a role in her disappearance. ""Kate and Gerry, we are truly sorry to have added to your distress,"" the Daily Express wrote. ""We assure you that we hope Madeleine will one day be found alive and well and will be restored to her loving family.""  Watch video on the newspapers apologies » . Media commentator Roy Greenslade told the BBC it was ""unprecedented"" for two national newspapers to run front-page apologies simultaneously. ""I think this is an amazing stand-down, U-turn, by the Express newspapers,"" he said. ""I think when people realize that more than 100 stories have been complained about as being grossly defamatory, it will annihilate the Express' readers sense of trust and credibility in their newspaper."" Madeleine's parents reported her missing last May 3, just days before her fourth birthday. At the time, they were on a family vacation at a resort in Praia da Luz, in southern Portugal. The parents have since garnered international support in an effort to find their daughter, enlisting the support of celebrities such as David Beckham and even Pope Benedict XVI. Portuguese investigators named the McCanns as official suspects last September. The parents deny any involvement, saying they believe Madeleine may have been abducted.

"TAMPA, Florida (CNN) -- Ron Russell was a machinist at the Hav-A-Tampa cigar factory in Tampa for 3½ years. Ron Russell has started a Web site to help find work for his fellow laid-off cigar factory workers. When he was hired, Russell remembers thinking, ""There's no reason I have to look for a job again. ... I was thinking, here's a place I can retire from. I thought I was safe in a 100-year-old company."" But Russell and his colleagues -- almost 500 workers -- recently lost their jobs when Hav-A-Tampa shut its doors in Florida to consolidate operations in Puerto Rico. The plant had been operating since 1902. After the plant closure, Russell didn't start pounding the pavement looking for another job for himself. Instead, he did something very different -- he decided to contact local businesses to see if they would hire his laid off colleagues. After a few calls, he realized it would be easier to centralize the employee information in one location, ideally a Web site. But that would cost money. So he asked each colleague for a dollar. ""I collected $30 out of the folks at work,"" Russell said. ""Some could give, some couldn't."" Soon, havatampaneedsjobs.com was born. On it are the names, contact information and skills of former Hav-A-Tampa employees who want to be listed. It's one-stop shopping, Russell said, for companies looking for workers. To use the site, laid-off employees can become a member by going to the site's home page, where they can list their employment and contact information. Potential employers can search the database by clicking on job titles such as engineer, electrician and general labor. Among those who donated and joined the site is Harvey Morris, a mechanical engineer with 23 years of experience. Morris said he was skeptical at first. ""But I also knew Ron. I knew that he was very determined,"" Morris said. When asked what type of workers an employer would find on the site, Morris said, ""Simply put, quality people, just quality people."" Since becoming the unofficial job placement advocate for his former colleagues, Russell said he has guarantees for 30 jobs, mostly for unskilled laborers who were laid off. Russell is overjoyed at the generosity of those businesses. His sales pitch: ""I told them if you could take one person you are a hero to 500."" ""I am kinda flying by the seat of my pants because I never done nothing like this before,"" Russell said.  Watch Russell talk about his efforts to find work for his former colleagues » . At one time, there were some 200 cigar factories in Tampa. It's down to one now, the J.C. Newman Company. Hav-A-Tampa officials said a new federal tax dramatically increased the price of their cigars and reduced consumption. ""It's an absolute tragedy. Totally preventable tragedy,"" said syndicated radio talk show host Dave Zeplowitz, known as ""Cigar Dave."" ""There's no other product that is taxed at 53 percent in this nation. ""This is a company that's given people tremendous livelihoods, and that's all gone,"" Zeplowitz said. ""Every piece of history in this city, every building is intertwined with cigars."" The new tax was levied to help fund a federal health insurance program for children from low-income families. Ironically, Russell said, his child qualifies now for the insurance, at least until he finds work. Russell doesn't blame his former employer for losing his job. ""I was unhappy about being taxed out of a job, because that's what happened,"" he said. Russell has put his own plans on hold while he helps his fellow workers. The father of one said he eventually plans to open his own machine shop. But he's not worried about the risk. ""I'm not going to be safe in a 100-year-old company, might as well try to not be safe in my own."" ""No. 1 will get his turn when it's time,"" Russell said. But now's the time, he said, to find work for the others.","Cigar factory closes its doors after 100 years in Tampa, Florida, leaving 500 jobless .

"(CNN) -- American Airlines mechanics will fix floor mounts in 48 of its 757s to prevent seats from coming loose, the airline said Thursday. Engineers figured out ""additional preventative steps"" to upgrade the mechanism that locks the seats to the floor, an American Airlines news release said. The carrier said 50 Thursday flights were canceled and 44 on Friday would likely be scrubbed because of the work, which is scheduled to be finished by Saturday. 3rd American Airlines flight in a week experiences loose seats . Three American planes had seats come loose while in flight, including a New York to Miami flight on Monday morning. ""American has instructed mechanics to pay particular attention to the seat lock plunger mechanism that secures the seat to the aircraft floor,"" the carrier said. A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration said the agency agreed with the decision to repair the seat problem at each plane's next stop. ""Our safety investigation continues and we'll take additional action as appropriate,"" Kathleen Bergen said. No plane will be grounded and each fix should take about two hours to complete, spokesman Kent Powell added. He called the fix a ""longer-term resolution."" American Airlines has a total of 102 757s, but these 48 planes have the same model seats. Who wants to fly American Airlines? The airline has also been beset recently by labor troubles, delays and flight cancellations. American, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year, persuaded a judge to throw out its contract with the pilots union last month. Since then, the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket. More than 1,000 American flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed in the past month alone. Airline management has blamed the situation on pilots filing what it claims are frivolous reports about aircraft problems. The pilots union has denied management's assertion.

"(CNN) -- When people across the world tune in to the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics on Friday, regular TV programming will be set aside for pageantry and pomp. Amid all the attention to the ""Made in China"" controversy about Team USA's uniforms, little has been written about their design. But if numerous online slide shows ranking the best and worst of the opening ceremonies uniforms are any indication, the design is what we're most interested in. Opinion: Why not make Olympic uniforms in China? Nations did not always wear uniforms in the Olympic Games, and the United States did not adopt a cohesive look until about 1920. Today, however, with huge worldwide audiences and markets at stake, the uniform is a calculated part of each nation's global image. The colors, patterns, silhouettes, lines and shapes of each nation's uniform form a statement about its identity. U.S. designers, for example, have frequently used white cowboy hats in their ensembles. Strike a pose: High style meets high performance at London 2012 . Designed by Ralph Lauren, Team USA's 2012 opening ceremony uniforms feature berets and navy, brass-buttoned, double-breasted blazers for the men that -- even without chevrons, medals or epaulettes -- draw clear inspiration from the dress uniforms of the U.S. Army and Navy. Should the appropriation of military style concern us? Almost all Olympic uniforms we see today derive from religious or military forms of apparel. Military apparel migrated to civilian life centuries ago, when veterans realized uniforms invited attributions of reliability, discipline and heroism and when various civil institutions used them as a means of regulating groups of people. Men's clothing strongly has been influenced by military looks, and the fashion industry markets ""military chic"" to women as well. America's love affair with military looks is especially intense and enduring. And unlike the Vietnam War, when military uniforms were appropriated in anti-war protests, today's military looks are part of a sartorial status quo that subtly affirms a pro-soldier, pro-military message. We know the athletes are not real warriors, of course, but clothing sends powerful messages. Fashion critics long have charged that military fashions are a problem because they aestheticize war and divorce clothes from their true functions and origins. We ought to be wary of efforts to make any aspect of war desirable. Considering that the U.S. spends more on defense than the next 10 nations combined, some would argue that dressing the Olympians like members of the armed forces during the biggest television event of the year is an arrogant or impolitic choice. Skeptics might counter that Jamaica's opening ceremony outfits are militaristic, too. But Jamaica's are more clearly sportswear, and in color, pattern and tone, their look is joyful and lighthearted. And Jamaica isn't a global military power. For most Americans, however, the military style of the 2012 the uniforms will raise little concern because we have been encouraged to ignore the countless ways in which military culture is integrated into our society. Fashion designers promote military styles as cutting edge, but usually refute the notion that the military aesthetic has anything to do with real war. Glitzy Pentagon marketing campaigns, military-backed Hollywood films and first-person shooter video games elevate the cultural status of uniformed troops and encourage us to identify with them. All of these things help maintain a pro-military citizenry. The 2012 Olympics uniforms are another in a long series of salutes to and affirmations of the American military. They are a product of an inherited, imperial history of clothing, of our particular war-fighting history and of the ""support the troops"" trope so common in 21st century war rhetoric. Readers: Forget uniforms, Olympians would bet better off 'naked' Whether we're comfortable with it or not, the military uniform of Team USA is at least as American as white cowboy hats. But there are other choices. Historically, roughly half of the U.S. opening ceremonies uniforms have been inspired by sportswear, including the excellent styles in the 2004 and 2008 Summer Games. Maybe it's time to get more creative. In the next Olympics, how about getting Betsey Johnson to design a uniform that is radically different? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Achter.","Paul Achter: In Olympics, uniform is a calculated part of each nation's global image .

"(CNN) -- Bill Coleman's business in New Orleans was looted during Hurricane Katrina. Now, Hurricane Isaac threatens to bombard the region with heavy wind and rain on Katrina's anniversary. He may have to close up shop again until the storm passes and, if necessary, power is restored. But this father of two and grandfather of one said he is ""not concerned."" ""Katrina was a once-in-a-lifetime event,"" the owner of Coleman's Retail Store told CNN Monday, noting that forecasters aren't predicting Katrina-like catastrophic conditions for the city he's lived in his whole life. Also, ""We have a vastly improved police department,"" Coleman said. ""A much higher level of conduct is expected. ... There have been a lot of positive changes."" ""The city was under siege"" during Katrina, with a ""total breakdown of society,"" he said. Now, ""it's just a different city.""

He doesn't think it'll be long before he reopens so the establishment -- which closed down for months in 2005 -- can resume serving the ""world's best baked ham."" It hasn't closed yet. Amato planned to ""wait until the last minute to decide whether to pull the trigger,"" but now he faces ""a quagmire.""

Thomas Blais, manager of the upscale men's shoe shop Allen Edmonds at New Orleans' Canal Place mall, said his and other shops were closing Monday ""because our families need to get home to prepare their houses for the storm."" But he, too, is ""not overly"" concerned about Isaac. While the mall experienced looting and fires during Katrina, he doesn't expect a repeat.

""It's wonderful after the storm, when everybody comes out and starts talking, drinking, and hanging out. ""That's the good part about the storms -- it brings neighbors together."" Coleman said those neighborly feelings have grown in recent years. ""I think we've got a really a much improved and a much higher level of thought and spirit in the city. There's much more unity.""

"London (CNN) -- Two senior British judges are due to decide on Friday if five men, among them extremist Islamist cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, will be extradited to the United States to face terrorism charges.

"(CNN) -- Fighting criticism of his controversial remarks on government dependency, Republican challenger Mitt Romney said Wednesday that he would better help poor and middle class Americans than President Barack Obama. Romney and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan also sought to reshape the campaign narrative less than seven weeks before the November vote by accusing Obama of favoring wealth redistribution -- code for socialism among conservatives -- based on a 1998 video of the president as a state Senate candidate in Illinois. America does not work by government making people dependent on government, Romney told a fundraising event in Atlanta, adding ""that will kill the American entrepreneurship that's lifted our economy over the years."" ""The question of this campaign is not who cares about the poor and the middle class? I do. He does,"" the former Massachusetts governor said to rising cheers. ""The question is who can help the poor and the middle class? I can! He can't!"" Romney spoke as fellow Republicans appeared divided over his secretly recorded comments from a May 17 fundraiser that were made public this week. ""There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,"" Romney said in a clip from the event first posted online on Monday. ""There are 47% who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that, that they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing."" He also said he would ""never convince"" the 47% of Americans who pay no federal income tax ""that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."" In response, three GOP Senate candidates in tough races this fall have distanced themselves from Romney's comments. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, told CNN on Wednesday that he had a ""a very different view of the world"" than what Romney expressed. ""As a United States senator, I think I represent everybody, and I think every vote is important,"" Heller said, adding: ""I don't write off anybody."" A day earlier, Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts and GOP candidate Linda McMahon of Connecticut released campaign statements denouncing Romney's comments. Some conservative commentators also criticized Romney, questioning whether he understood the conservative principles he championed to win the Republican nomination. ""These appear to be the words of somebody who doesn't understand American conservatism and its relationship to the American idea,"" wrote journalist John McCormack of the conservative Weekly Standard. ""Conservatives don't believe in economic determinism. Conservatives know -- and explain why -- their economic policies will help the poor, as well as senior citizens, working families, and our troops who pay no income taxes."" Others on the political right defended Romney's comments as an accurate assessment of growing societal dependence on government through entitlement and welfare programs that are major contributors to the mounting federal deficit and debt. ""I think the basic point is correct. It's what this election is about. Do we want a government-centered society?"" said GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. ""Do we want to continue to build government and grow our debt at an unsustainable level and bankrupt this nation? Or do we want to start working toward a path of opportunity, success - things that actually make this country great."" 'Anatomy of a leak' of the Mitt Romney video . A flurry of polls this week showed Romney unable to make up ground on Obama and slipping behind in some key battleground states, including Virginia. A new CNN/ORC International survey on Wednesday showed Obama also holding a 52%-44% lead in Romney's birth state of Michigan. Another new poll showed the secretly recorded Romney comments had a moderately negative impact on registered voters so far. The Gallup survey taken Tuesday showed 36% of registered voters indicated they would be less likely to vote for Romney after the videotapes were released, while 20% said they were more likely to vote for Romney and 43% said the comments made no difference. Meanwhile, the Drudge Report on Tuesday posted a video clip of Obama reportedly recorded in 1998 at Loyola University in which he discussed ways to make government more effective. ""I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution - because I actually believe in some redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot,"" Obama says in the clip. Both Ryan and Romney made sure to mention the redistribution reference on the campaign trail on Wednesday. ""President Obama said that he believes in redistribution,"" Ryan told supporters in Danville, Virginia. ""Mitt Romney and I are not running to redistribute the wealth. Mitt Romney and I are running to help Americans create wealth."" At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney characterized the GOP attacks as an effort to divert attention from Romney's controversial remarks. Obama believed in 1998 and still believes that ""there are steps we can take to promote opportunity and ensure that all Americans have a fair shot, if they work hard,"" Carney said. ""He certainly doesn't believe -- as some apparently do -- that any student who looks for a government-backed loan is looking for a handout or that a senior citizen receiving Social Security is a freeloader or a combat veteran not paying taxes is a victim,"" Carney continued, adding: ""When a campaign is having a bad day or a bad week or some might say a bad month ... you sometimes witness an effort that seems desperate to change the subject."" Other Democrats were quick to pile on. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Romney's comments showed he only wants to be president of half the country. ""We have a long line of people who are running from Romney as if the Olympics are still on,"" Reid quipped about GOP Senate candidates Heller, Brown and McMahon. Obama told the ""Late Show With David Letterman"" on Tuesday night that ""one of the things I learned as president is you represent the entire country. If you want to be president, you have to work for everyone."" The Romney remarks, which sparked numerous fact checks, have gained more attention on Facebook than his speech at last month's Republican National Convention. Democrats pounce on Romney comments . Priorities USA, a pro-Obama super PAC, is using the Romney clips in a new television ad to characterize Romney as out of touch with Americans' economic struggles. The group said Wednesday the commercial would air in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin, all battlegrounds that Obama won in 2008 and hopes to take again in November. On Tuesday, Ryan said at a campaign stop in North Carolina that Romney's comments were ""obviously inarticulate"" but made the correct point that people have become too dependent on government under Obama. Romney presented the same argument Wednesday in a USA Today op-ed. ""Under President Obama, we have a stagnant economy that fosters government dependency. My policies will create a growing economy that fosters upward mobility,"" he wrote. ""Government has a role to play here. Right now, our nation's citizens do need help from government. But it is a very different kind of help than what President Obama wants to provide."" How candidates are preparing for the debates .

"(CNN) -- Jim Lehrer, the mainstay of public television's longest running news show, is stepping aside as anchor of ""PBS Newshour"" next month, PBS announced Thursday. Lehrer will continue working with the daily show, helping with editorial direction and moderating a weekly segment, the network said. ""I have been laboring in the glories of daily journalism for 52 years, 36 of them here at the Newshour and its earlier incarnations and there comes a time to step aside from the daily process, and that time has arrived,"" Lehrer said in a written statement. The move becomes effective on June 6, PBS said. Lehrer served as the show's Washington correspondent when it premiered as the half-hour ""Robert MacNeil Report"" in 1975. It was renamed ""The MacNeil/Lehrer Report"" the next year to reflect his larger role. It became ""The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer"" when Robert MacNeil retired in 1995. Lehrer began paving the way for this transition in December 2009 when he agreed to drop his name from the title, making it the ""PBS Newshour."" A multi-anchor team featuring Lehrer has hosted the show since the latest name change. ""It is the most constructive and graceful exit strategy I have ever seen for someone holding a coveted and senior position in today's media,"" MacNeil said in a written statement. ""It guarantees a continued place in today's bewildering media spectrum for a program that will stay devoted to serious journalism."" Lehrer will be on the show ""on many Friday evenings"" to moderate the weekly analysis of syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks, PBS said.","Lehrer steps aside on June 6 .

"(CNN) -- The Muslim cleric who once described Britain as a toilet has launched an appeal to avoid extradition to the United States on terrorism charges, a representative for the High Court in London said. The representative would not give more details of the appeal or the grounds for it, or talk about other suspects included in the appeal. Abu Hamza al-Masri faces a potential life sentence in America after nearly a decade of legal battles. He was convicted in a British court and jailed in 2006 for a variety of terror-related crimes. Al-Masri was born in Egypt in 1958 and gained citizenship in Britain through marriage in the 1980s. He once worked as a London nightclub bouncer. He has a hook for a hand and only one eye, the result of fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. In 1997, he became the imam of a north London mosque, where his hate-filled speeches attacking the West began to attract national attention. His followers included Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, who attempted to blow up a Miami-bound passenger airplane three months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Al-Masri has called the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center ""a towering day in history"" and described former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as ""a good guy and a hero."" He also described the Columbia space shuttle disaster as ""punishment from Allah"" because the astronauts were Christian, Hindu and Jewish. The shuttle disintegrated on re-entry to Earth in February 2003, killing all seven people aboard.","Abu Hamza al-Masri's hate-filled speeches at a London mosque inspired followers of al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- The Mars rover Curiosity will get to try out its scoop this weekend, according to current NASA plans. ""The request that the engineers made to the scientists was: Find us a good sandbox, a good sand pit, to play in here, on our way to Glenelg,"" said Mike Watkins, Curiosity mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, at a press conference Thursday. ""This site, Rocknest, is exactly that."" The vehicle is currently parked 400 meters as the crow flies from Bradbury Landing, where it landed on August 6. It will likely stay there for another two weeks, with scooping to begin on Saturday. Curiosity rotated its wheel around the sandy material where it is to make sure that it was loose, dry soil, Watkins said. The rover will use its instruments to further determine what this sand is made of, to make sure it meets the scientists' needs. The sand also serves as a sort of ""mouthwash"" for Curiosity to finish cleaning out its hardware, NASA experts said. There are five tools at the end of the rover's robotic arm. The Collection and Handling for Interior Martian Rock Analysis mechanism does scooping, processing and sample drop-off. What we've done on Mars, and what's next . Although the hardware was clean when it was assembled at NASA facilities, it's impossible to avoid an oily film that accumulates as a result of being on Earth, said Daniel Limonadi, a sampling expert at JPL. The sample analysis instrument on Curiosity is so sensitive that it needs this film scrubbed away. The handling of sand sample will be used as a way to accomplish this, Limonadi said. Effectively, the rover will vibrate the sand on sensitive hardware surfaces to sand-blast them, then spit the material out and repeat three times. Scientists were looking for a ""boring"" and ""safe"" Martian sand dune for this purpose to make sure that it wouldn't do something weird such as turn to paste or absorb water, Limonadi said. The rover will be performing an X-ray diffraction experiment, using a device called ChemMin, to help detect the minerals present in the sample. This technique has never been done before on Mars, said Ashwin Vasavada, deputy project scientist for the rover mission. ""Even the most boring sand on Mars is going to be a new result in that respect."" Mission specialists say the rover will probably end up at Glenelg around the rover's 90th Martian day, and then Curiosity will pause to try out its drilling system. There will be a similar cleaning activity for the drill. Days on Mars are about 40 minutes longer than on Earth, and the people working on the mission are still living on ""Mars time."" In its first two months on Mars, Curiosity stumbled upon an area where it appears that water once flowed in a vigorous stream. Scientists say the rover spotted rock outcrops that seem to have formed in the presence of water, with rounded gravels that may have been transported by water. But the rover did not linger at these sites. Instead, drivers proceeded to command Curiosity to continue moving toward Glenelg, a site of scientific interest because it contains three types of terrain, including layered bedrock. ""We think there's even better versions of that same material at Glenelg, at least that's the hypothesis,"" Vasavada said. If that doesn't pan out, Curiosity can visit some of the outcrops it's already passed on the way back. After Glenelg, Curiosity is bound for a 3-mile-high mountain called Mount Sharp, composed of layers of sediment that have built up over time. These layers may hold organic molecules, indicating that at one time life could have subsisted. Also this week, Curiosity checked in on Mars using the mobile application Foursquare. While no human will be overthrowing the rover's check-in supremacy anytime soon, users of Foursquare can score a Curiosity-themed badge when checking in at certain science-y locations. This program will go into effect later this year. Read more about the Mars rover on CNN's Light Years blog .","""Find us a sandbox,"" engineers asked scientists .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who left office last June, has taken up a part-time job with a Wall Street bank on an estimated $1 million salary. JP Morgan Chase did not say how much Blair will make in the part-time position. Blair will work with JP Morgan Chase, a firm with assets of $1.5 trillion and operations in more than 50 countries. He will advise the bank on global political and strategic issues, a company statement said. ""We operate our business all over the world, and Tony Blair will bring our leaders and clients a unique and invaluable global perspective that is especially critical in turbulent times like these,"" said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of the company, in the statement. Neither Blair nor the bank would say how much the former PM would be paid. A New York recruitment consultant though told the Financial Times that the job was likely to be worth more than $987,000 (£500,000) a year. Advisory jobs such as the one Blair has accepted are popular among former world leaders. His predecessor as prime minister, John Major, took a position with the Carlyle Group, a private investment house, as did former U.S. President George H.W. Bush. Blair left 10 Downing Street in June after a decade as prime minister, and took an appointment as a special envoy for the Middle East Quartet, which includes the United States, the United Nations, Russia and the European Union. The quartet hopes to re-energize the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians. During his tenure as prime minister, Blair's Labour Party won three straight general elections. In addition, peace came to Northern Ireland and the British economy boomed. But the Iraq war and several domestic controversies damaged Blair's reputation. Before his re-election in 2005, Blair had vowed to serve a full third term, but political infighting within Labour ranks culminated in a political coup that prompted him to leave office early.

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- About 50 students broke into a Dutch consulate compound in Indonesia Wednesday to protest a film by a Dutch lawmaker that many Muslims consider anti-Islamic. Protesters demonstrate against an anti-Islamic film in front of the Dutch embassy in Jakarta. The protesters tore off the gate of the embassy in the city of Medan and ripped down a flag, said Dutch Embassy spokeswoman Gonneke de Ridder. Local television carried pictures of police dispersing and rounding up demonstrators. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim nation. The 15-minute film, ""Fitna,"" features disturbing images of terrorist acts juxtaposed over verses from the Quran to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. It has been posted on several Web sites, including Google Video and YouTube. Dutch Prime Minister Jan Beter Balkanende has said his government worried that Geert Wilders' film could provoke a violent backlash. The film has prompted protests in other parts of the Muslim world. Soon after its release last month, hundreds of angry Muslims rallied in Pakistan, where the government temporarily blocked access of YouTube over a trailer for Wilders' film. The protesters burned the Dutch flag and called on Pakistan to cut ties with the Netherlands. The Dutch government and others, including the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, have rejected the film. The OIC has 57 member states over four continents and claims on its Web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization, after the United Nations. In its statement, it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the Dutch government to prosecute the author of the documentary under Dutch law. Wilders has stood by his project. ""My intention was not to offend in any way, but to show the truth -- at least the truth as I see it,"" Wilders told CNN. ""And if the truth hurts and could be offensive, well, this of course is not my problem."" Wilders is a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom and an outspoken critic of Islam. He said he has ""big problems"" with Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the Quran and ""everything that is stated inside this terrible book."" The title, ""Fitna,"" translates in Arabic to ""strife"" or ""conflict"" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. The film opens with passages from the Quran, interspersed with graphic images of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States . The video also includes disturbing images of other terror attacks -- bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional Muslim attire; and footage, with subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians.

"Polokwane, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African court charged Julius Malema with money laundering Wednesday, and the firebrand politician scoffed at the accusations and riled up his supporters moments after his release on bail. The former youth leader went into an anti-government tirade after his release. He said the charge against him is politically motivated by President Jacob Zuma. Speaking into a microphone, Malema, who appeared without his trademark beret and donned a dark suit and burgundy tie for the hearing, addressed his raucous supporters near the court. He belittled the allegations against him as minor, saying the president told authorities to ""just arrest him for anything."" Prosecutors accused him of unlawfully benefiting from proceeds generated by companies he had shares in. The 31-year-old, who was youth leader for the African National Congress, was thrown out of the ruling party this year. He has denied the allegation. The court did not provide additional details of the charge against him because it is still finalizing the documents, it said. The ruling party said the allegations are not politically motivated. ""The charges have been preferred by competent institutions that derive from our Constitution,"" the party said in a statement. ""We want to put it on record that we have confidence in our state institutions to discharge their duties without any political motive."" Before the hearing, Malema's supporters sang songs deriding the president outside the court in Polokwane. After an overnight vigil at a local hall, they waited for him outside the court, peeking behind razor wire amid heavy security that included riot police. Police closed roads leading to the court and deployed a water cannon to the scene. ""Hands off Malema,"" placards outside the court read. ""Malema will rule one day!"" Who is Julius Malema? Malema was freed on $1,215 bail and is scheduled to return to court on November 30. Crimes in South Africa are categorized between schedule one and schedule five, the latter being the most serious. His alleged crime falls under schedule one, according to his lawyers. Malema, once a major ally of the president, is now one of his fiercest critics. His populist rhetoric has made him a controversial figure in the nation and sparked outrage in the ruling party. His supporters have said he is being persecuted for challenging Zuma's leadership before a December vote for head of the powerful ruling party. Malema's brash, populist message resonates with some of the nation's disenfranchised, who took to the streets in protest when he was ousted from the ruling party. The party, accusing him of sowing division and hate speech, first suspended him, then shot down his appeal and expelled him in April. Zuma and Malema broke ties despite the latter's role in propelling him to power in 2009. Malema was instrumental in the president's election and campaigned across the nation on his behalf. In recent years, he has accused his administration of intolerance and failure to improve the lives of the poor. Malema has also called for nationwide strikes in the mining industry, dismaying politicians trying to quell labor discontent among workers. His calls came after police killed 34 striking mine workers in August during the miners' labor protests to demand higher pay. The killings -- one of the deadliest attacks since the end of apartheid -- sparked a firestorm in the nation. Malema's controversial road to fame includes his calls to seize white-owned farms in South Africa, especially incendiary in a nation with a history of racial tensions. The self-described ""economic freedom fighter"" has renewed his calls for the nationalization of mines, unnerving potential investors. Polokwane, which is north of Johannesburg, is the capital of Malema's native Limpopo province.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two suicide bombers struck a joint U.S.-Afghan military base in central Afghanistan early Saturday, killing 13 people, authorities said. Among the dead were a child, two women and four policemen, said Shahidullah Shahid, a spokesman for the Wardak province governor. The attack wounded 78 others. One bomber attacked the base on foot, then another one detonated a truck, Shahid said. No international coalition service members died in the attack in Wardak's Sayedabad district, according to Maj. Adam Wojack, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force. However two coalition members were wounded, Shahid said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Violence against Afghan civilians fell in the first half of the year, according to a recent United Nations report. But even though attacks were down compared with the first six months of 2011, violence is taking a ""devastating toll on civilians,"" the report said. In the first six months of this year, 1,145 Afghans were killed and 1,954, injured -- down from the 1,510 killed and 2,144 injured in the same period a year earlier. The drop marked the first time in five years there has been a fall in violence against civilians, the report said. About 80% of the attacks against civilians are by anti-government forces such as the Taliban, the report said.

"(CNET) -- Coming from a company known more for its plasma HDTVs, the Panasonic TC-32LX85 is a pleasant surprise in the 32-inch LCD category. Attractively designed and well appointed with generous connectivity, it is also a good performer overall, although by no means perfect. I was particularly impressed with the set's color accuracy, which is something I really don't expect from entry-level displays. Compared with the competition, the LC-32LX85 represents a compelling value in small LCD screens when you consider its performance characteristics. Design . Basic in its design, but simultaneously elegant-looking, the TC-35LX85 has a glossy black finish, with a 3-inch-wide bezel surrounding the screen on all sides. It is a small and unobtrusive television that will fit into just about any decor nicely. Side panel AV inputs are neatly tucked away behind the right side of the screen. The remote control is identical to Panasonic's current plasma line of HDTVs, with an excellent ergonomic design. It is on the large side, but slender enough to fit in the hand comfortably. Unfortunately, the remote is not backlit. The internal menu graphical user interface is also quite simple and intuitive to use and navigate. Features . The Panasonic TC-32LCX85's offers a fairly comprehensive feature package for an entry-level 32-inch LCD TV. Its native resolution is 1366x768, or around 720p, whereas many higher-end models have a 1080p native resolution. At this screen size, however, the benefits of 1080p resolution are nearly impossible to discern with moving video, whether standard- or high-definition. If you plan on regularly using your 32-inch LCD TV as a computer monitor, however, you might want to consider a 1080p model. Picture adjustment options are OK, but not as extensive as found on the Samsung LN32A450 or LG32LG30 for example. Preset picture modes include Cinema, Game, Custom, Vivid, and Standard. Custom can be adjusted independently per input while the others can be tweaked as well and apply to every input. Selectable color temperatures include Warm, Normal, and Cool. The Backlight feature may be the most important in terms of optimizing the panel's picture, as it helps it achieve reasonably deep black levels when lowered from its factory setting. Some dubious picture-adjusting features include Color Management and AI Picture, both of which should be shut off for optimum performance. AI is an auto-contrast feature that raises and lowers the light output of the panel depending on ambient room lighting. This ultimately makes black and white level a moving target, and both of these parameters really should remain constant. In the Advanced menu there are two varieties of noise reduction, called Video NR and MPEG NR, and for high-quality sources both should be turned-off. Black Level should be set to Light for full shadow detail, although intuitively I would think Dark would be correct. (Panasonic always had Lighter and Darker settings that were intuitively correct at 7.5 and 0 IRE respectively in their DVD players. Strangely, for their TVs, it is backward.) Connection options are generous enough on the Panasonic, although unlike most other small-screen flat-panel sets it lacks a VGA-style PC input. The rear panel does have two HDMI inputs, one component video input, one AV input with a choice of either composite or S-Video, and one RF input. One set of analog audio outputs, and one digital optical audio output for routing sound to an external AV receiver are also on tap. Side panel inputs include one HDMI, and one set of AV inputs with composite video only, and an SD Card slot on the right side of the panel for viewing your digital photos. We'd like to see a headphone jack on the side as well, but no dice. Performance . The Panasonic LC-32LX85 is one of the better performers at its size in the entry-level, 720p-resolution LCD category. Color accuracy and black level performance are its main strengths, while color decoding and standard-definition processing are not. I didn't have to make too many adjustments during the user menu calibration to get the little TV looking its best. Since there are no custom color temperature controls in the user menu, I simply chose the best picture mode (Custom) and color temperature preset (Warm) and then tweaked the remainder of the basic picture controls. Afterward I was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of the grayscale; you can click here to access my full picture settings. For my comparison I looked at the Panasonic alongside the Sony KDL-32M4000, the Westinghouse VK-40F580D and the Vizio VP322, two LCDs and a 32-inch plasma respectively. Black level: Blacks are reasonably good for an inexpensive LCD flat-panel TV, and deeper than either the Sony or the Vizio, although not quite as deep as the Westinghouse. The Panasonic also delivers the blacker-than-black video signals that many more expensive displays cannot, which helps lead to improved shadow detail. Chapter two of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" showed off the LC-32LX85's compelling blacks very nicely. This high-contrast scene takes place at night, with bright explosions going off to provide a good look at an HDTV's shadow detail capability. There was plenty of fine detail in the background dark areas of the picture. The black areas of the picture were deep, rich, and inky, and the scene was relatively free of low-level noise. Color accuracy: As you can see from the Geek Box, grayscale tracking in the Warm color temperature preset was impressive, and the primary colors of red, green, and blue also measured reasonably close to the HDTV standard, which is unusual even in some expensive flat-panel displays. Color decoding does push red a bit though, so we had to desaturate the color somewhat and remove some of the picture's punch. Colors still appeared vibrant, however, and skin tones looked quite natural. Chapter four of the awesome transfer of ""I, Robot"" proved an excellent scene to show off the Panasonic's contrast ratio--good blacks and whites creating a snappy picture--as well as its accurate color reproduction. Video processing: Unlike most modern HDTVs the LC-32LX85 doesn't accept 1080p sources, so my evaluation had to be with all HD sources set to 1080i. The set lacks an aspect ratio that provides for zero overscan, which would be a bigger issue if it were a 1080p resolution panel, but really isn't a big deal the panel has only a 720p resolution. The video processing does roll off the high-frequency video somewhat, a common flaw with many flat-panel sets on the market today. Uniformity: White-field uniformity was reasonably good on this panel, and that is saying something for an LCD. As you may know LCD display technologies, whether flat panel or projection, suffer from poor white-field uniformity. As a result you may see red and blue splotches in scenes that are primarily white like the ice in a hockey game or a movie like ""Ice Age."" This Panasonic, while not perfect, was better than most in this performance test. Standard-definition: The Panasonic is a mediocre performer with standard-def material. It didn't resolve every line of horizontal resolution according to the charts on the HQV disc, and as a result some images appeared a bit softer than normal. It did a below-average job of smoothing out jaggies on rotating diagonal lines, and there were a good number of such artifacts in a waving American flag. The set's noise reduction, on the other hand, was very good at cleaning up moving motes in low-quality images of skies and sunsets, and the set engaged 2:3 pull-down detection quickly and effectively. PC: Absent a VGA-style PC input I attempted to test the Panasonic's capability to handle digital signals from a PC via its HDMI jack. The best resolution the video card allowed was 1,280x768, which is short of the set's native resolution, and there was enough overscan that important areas of the screen, including the Windows taskbar, were obscured. People who want a PC display should probably choose another set. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved. CNET, CNET.com and the CNET logo are registered trademarks of CBS Interactive Inc.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The Indian Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the death sentence for Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving gunman from the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. A trial court sentenced Kasab, a Pakistani, to death in 2010 on charges of murder, conspiracy and waging war on India. The High Court of Mumbai upheld his conviction and sentence in February last year. Now, the Supreme Court has done the same, rejecting his argument that he hadn't received a fair trial. ""The court has had a chance to appreciate the evidence completely,"" Gopal Subramaniam, a lawyer for the prosecution, said after the verdict. He noted that Kasab had been provided with state-appointed lawyers for his different court hearings. With his appeal rejected by India's highest court, the options are running out for Kasab. He can still file a review motion with the Supreme Court. If that fails, he can submit a clemency petition to the president. During the November 2008 assault on Mumbai, 10 heavily armed men attacked landmarks around the city, including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. More than 160 people were killed in the coordinated attacks that lasted three days. Indian forces killed nine of the suspects, but Kasab, who was photographed holding an assault weapon during the violence, survived and was arrested. India blamed the siege on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistani-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. Indian authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on the Indian parliament. The group has denied responsibility. The Mumbai attacks destabilized peace talks between the Indian and Pakistani governments, which remain bitterly opposed over issues like the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. In the subsequent years, the two nuclear-armed nations have resumed the high-level meetings and relations have improved. In April, President Asif Ali Zardari met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi during a brief private trip. It was the first visit to India by a Pakistani head of state in seven years. Indian sporting authorities also recently announced the resumption of bilateral cricket tournaments with Pakistan. The sport has often been used as a platform to ease relations. But tensions remain close to the surface. This month, New Delhi alleged that ""elements"" in Pakistan were using social-networking sites to stir religious unrest in India amid ethnic clashes between Muslim migrants and native tribal groups in the northeastern state of Assam.

"Kagadi, Uganda (CNN) -- One of five prisoners receiving treatment for a suspected case of Ebola virus in Uganda escaped overnight Friday from the hospital at the center of the outbreak, a health official said. ""Should his results come back and he is positive, that causes us a lot of worry. So right now, we have resolved that the remaining prisoners will be cuffed on the beds for fear that they might also escape,"" said Dr. Jackson Amune, commissioner at the Ministry of Health. The inmates from Kibaale prison are among 30 people at Kagadi hospital with suspected cases of the virus. Two additional patients have confirmed cases, according to Doctors Without Borders. The prisoners have been showing Ebola-like symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and fever, Dr. Dan Kyamanywa said Thursday. ""We do expect the number of suspected cases to increase,"" Kyamanywa said. ""It's important to break transmission and reduce the number of contacts that suspected cases have."" Read more: Ebola outbreak suspected among Uganda prisoners . Many patients fled Kagadi hospital when Ebola was confirmed, he said, and the facility is struggling to respond to all the call-outs to suspected cases. The outbreak began in the Kibaale district in western Uganda with 53 confirmed cases. At least 16 people have died. An additional 312 people have suspected cases of the virus and have been isolated, pending further testing. The deaths have stoked heightened fear of the virus, a highly infectious, often fatal agent spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. Symptoms can include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, a measles-like rash, red eyes and, at times, bleeding from body openings. ""I would like to stress that the disease is under control,"" said Joaquim Saweka, the World Health Organization representative to Uganda. Health officials urged the public to report any suspected cases, to avoid contact with anyone infected and to wear gloves and masks while disinfecting bedding and clothing of infected people. Officials also advised avoiding public gatherings in the affected district. Read more: Could the Ebola outbreak spread to the U.S.? Teams in Uganda are taking an aggressive approach, including trying to track down anyone who came into contact with patients infected with the virus, and health workers have been gearing up to protect themselves and deal with an influx of cases. The workers include people from Uganda's Ministry of Health, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, officials in Kenya were taking extra precautions after at least two patients showed symptoms of the virus, according to Jackstone Omoto, a medical official in Siaya, western Kenya. One man tested negative. A second man and two relatives have been isolated at the Moi Teaching & Referral Hospital in Eldoret, pending test results. The man was traveling from South Sudan to Kenya through Uganda.

"(CNN) -- Throngs of mourners bid farewell to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on Sunday in Ethiopia's first state funeral for a leader in more than 80 years. Meles, 57, died two weeks ago of an unspecified illness. He had not appeared in public for months, sparking nationwide speculation about his health. The prime minister, a key U.S. ally, is the first leader honored with a state funeral in the nation since Empress Zauditu in 1930. A contingent of African heads of state and foreign envoys attended the ceremony at the main square in the capital of Addis Ababa. Presidents of Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and Nigeria were among leaders who hailed him for bringing development to the nation during his 21-year rule. Mourners followed the coffin as it made its way through the capital in a horse-drawn carriage accompanied by a marching band. Others flooded the streets, some in tears, clutching miniature flags and posters adorned with his picture. His relatives, who were dressed in black, sat on stage with the heads of state. In days leading up to the funeral, his flag-draped coffin lay at the national palace for a public viewing. He will be laid to rest at the Holy Trinity Church behind the palace, where famed Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie is buried. Meles was credited with working toward peace and security in the region, and was instrumental in peace talks between Sudan and South Sudan. He dispatched Ethiopian troops to battle militants in Somalia, and is a major player in the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa. Ethiopia is often lauded for effective use of aid money, and his nation has remained relatively peaceful in the unstable horn of Africa region. He was a leader who focused on the big picture, said Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., who attended the funeral. Meles came to the forefront as a leader of a guerrilla insurgency against dictator Haile Mengistu Mariam in 1991, and cemented power in the ensuing decades. However, human rights groups accused his government of a heavy hand and a series of abuses, including limiting press freedoms and cracking down on the opposition. ""He came to power at the barrel of a gun, but he made the transition from rebel leader to political leader very quickly,"" said Ayo Johnson, director of Viewpoint Africa. Though he was vilified for his human rights record, the West turned a blind eye to his shortcomings because he battled Islamist movements in the region, a major concern for the U.S., according to Johnson. Meles' relatively unknown successor, Hailemariam Desalegn, served as his deputy. The next ballot is scheduled for 2015, government officials said. CNN's Richard Greene contributed to this report.","African heads of state and foreign envoys attend the ceremony .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Philadelphia Judge M. Teresa Sarmina ruled Friday to stay the execution of Terrance Williams and grant a new penalty phase in the case, after finding that authorities had suppressed evidence of alleged sexual abuse. Williams, 46, had been scheduled to be executed on October 3 for a 1984 slaying in which he beat Amos Norwood to death with a tire iron. Sarmina found ""reasonable probability"" that the verdict might have been different had allegations of abuse surfaced during the initial case, noting that the relationship between the two men had been established but not disclosed. Williams attorney Shawn Nolan said the defense team is ""very gratified"" by the decision, having maintained that information about the alleged abuse was withheld from the trial and that Williams' life should instead be spent in a cell. The sexual abuse began when Williams was 6 years old, his attorneys have said. They argued that the jurors who convicted Williams more than 25 years ago were told that it was a robbery-homicide case and never learned of the abuse allegations. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said Friday that he would appeal the decision. He has said the abuse allegations are hearsay and ""a last-ditch effort to escape punishment."" ""In the 28 years since the murder of Amos Norwood, these new allegations only came to light just a few months ago, and (Williams) is not the one making the allegations."" Announcing the scheduled execution, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett's office described the brutal Philadelphia killing. Williams and accomplice Marc Draper led Norwood, 56, to an area near a cemetery, forced him to lie on the ground, tied him up, gagged him and stole his valuables, the governor's office said in a statement. ""Williams and Draper repeatedly beat the man with a tire iron and a socket wrench and then drove away in the victim's car. Williams later returned and burned Norwood's body,"" the statement said. Draper is serving a life sentence. On September 17, the state's Board of Pardons failed to reach the unanimous agreement required to recommend clemency. Three members of the five-person panel voted in favor of asking Corbett to consider granting clemency. But the two other board members voted against the petition. Since the execution date was set, a number of high-profile supporters have called for clemency in the case, including Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly. More than 360,000 people have signed an online petition asking authorities to spare Williams' life. Norwood's widow has also asked for the execution to be called off. But Norwood's daughter wants the execution to go forward, the Philadelphia district attorney's office said. She said Friday that accusations of sexual abuse were false and asked the court to uphold the death penalty.","NEW: Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams will appeal the decision .

"London (CNN) -- A striped crosswalk in London entered the history books Wednesday for a second time. First, the Beatles made it famous by walking across it on the cover of their ""Abbey Road"" album, prompting millions of imitators. Then, this week, the British government declared the zebra crossing a historic landmark -- the first street crossing ever to get the designation. ""It is a fantastic testimony to the international fame of the Beatles that -- more than 40 years on -- this crossing continues to attract thousands of visitors each year, trying to mimic their iconic 'Abbey Road' album cover,"" British heritage minister John Penrose said. The street crossing is near the Abbey Road music studios, where the album was recorded. The studios themselves were declared a historic landmark in February. Paul McCartney, who appears barefoot on the album cover, said he and the Beatles had had a great year and that the designation of the crosswalk was ""icing on the cake."" He and Ringo Starr are the only two living Beatles. John Lennon was shot and killed in 1980, and George Harrison died of cancer in 2001.","Millions have imitated the Beatles album cover .

"(CNN) -- Syria's shelling of a border town in Turkey has sparked fears that President Bashar al-Assad's attempt to snuff out a rebellion at home could turn into a damaging regional war between the two neighbors. Five civilians, all women and children, in the town of Akcakale were killed by Syrian artillery rounds in the worst single case of violence on the Turkish side of the border since Syria's unrest began last year. What's behind Syria's shelling of Turkey? While Syria hasn't confirmed its motive for firing into Turkey, rebels fighting an 18-month war against the Assad regime have allegedly been using positions on the Turkish border as a safe haven to regroup and re-arm following battles with Syrian troops. Another explanation, says one expert, is that in a cat-and-mouse pursuit to neutralize rebel groups near the border, Syrian artillery units simply overshot their target. ""These things happen in the fog of war,"" Jeremy Binnie, Middle East and Africa editor of Jane's Defence Weekly, told CNN. ""If your artillery battery is 10 kilometers away and you're trying to call a strike down on the border, it's pretty easy to put a few rounds in the wrong place if you put in the calculations wrong."" Opinion: Why Turkey, Syria don't want war . The incident prompted the Turkish parliament to give the government powers to authorize troops to deploy to foreign countries, along with retaliatory Turkish artillery strikes on military positions in Syria -- but both sides have insisted they don't want war. Which country, Syria or Turkey, has the stronger military? Turkey, a NATO member, has the most powerful military in the region. Binnie says Turkey flies Western-made jets, and that its older equipment has been upgraded and supplemented with early-warning radar airplanes and unmanned drones. Turkey also has a formidable ground force that has spent decades fighting the Kurdish separatist rebels of the KPP in the southeast of the country. Analysis: Kurds add explosive element to Syria equation . Despite their robust military capability, and despite the fact the Syrian army has been worn down by 18 months of civil war, Binnie says Syria's missile capabilities mean Turkey's not interested in anything more than limited border excursions. ""Turkey wouldn't want to tangle with the Syrians, who do still have the ultimate deterrent of long-range chemical weapons capabilities,"" he told CNN. What weapons do Syrian forces have? Where are they coming from? Syria's greatest strength has also been its weakness in the current fight against rebels. The Assad regime spent years buying up sophisticated long range missiles, air defense systems and chemical weapons to counter the threat of an airborne attack from Israel. But the long-term focus on long range weaponry has left the regime unprepared to fight a guerrilla war in the streets of Syrian cities -- an approach that requires flexible, mobile infantry with stockpiles of smaller arms. Syria has been the Middle East's top importer of Russian weaponry, most of which is now more than 20 years old -- and Binnie says the Syrian air force has been underfunded to the point of ""regime forces dropping what amount to IEDs (improvised explosive devices) from helicopters."" Recently, Syria has attempted to get some of its Mi-24 attack helicopters refurbished by Russia -- a move which prompted an international outcry -- and has ordered Yak-130 advanced training jets and MiG-29 fighter jets that have yet to be delivered. While the Kremlin has pledged not to deliver new weapons to Syria, it is unclear whether the Assad regime will get the weapons it ordered before the uprising began last year. Syria's heavy weaponry and battle tanks may be Russian made, but wars of attrition like this also require huge amounts of small arms. To that end, Iran -- Syria's other major regional ally -- has been using Iraqi airspace to fly small arms, infantry weaponry and personnel into Syria, according to U.S. officials. Analysis: What does Iran get for supporting Assad? Iraq says it is conducting random searches on Syrian-bound Iranian planes that use its airports, but as Binnie points out, ""the Iraqis don't have any way to force Iranian planes to land."" In addition to the tanks and troops fanned out across the country, Syria has also deployed communications interception systems to try to track rebels. CNN reporters who have been on the ground there say for the most part using a cell phone is out of the question, as Syrian forces can easily triangulate the user's location. What weapons do Syrian rebels have? Where are they coming from? The rebels are severely outmatched, and most of their weaponry was either taken from Syrian military arsenals or obtained from local black markets. In addition to individual infantry weapons like AK-47s, tripod-mounted PK machine guns, and RPG-7 grenade launchers -- the ubiquitous shoulder-mounted weapons seen on nightly news reports from conflicts around the world -- Binnie says rebels have also been seen with Strela-2 shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles. Rebels have also commandeered Syrian tanks, but since they don't generally have the capacity to maintain and refuel them, according to Binnie, they've instead been stripping off the heavier guns and mounting them on civilian vehicles. Binnie says the increasing number of improvised weapons and explosives being used in Syria shows the rebels, without a foreign power to supply them, may be struggling to maintain adequate levels of ammunition. ""Some of the weapons in Syria look very similar to what we've seen in the last year in Iraq, where they've finally ran out of all the ordinates that were lying around from the 2003 U.S. invasion and have had to improvise,"" he told CNN. What other groups are operating in Syria? Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, says militant groups ""of all persuasions"" are now operating in Syria -- and that some groups increasingly appear to be carrying out joint co-ordinated attacks. While Lister says the majority of the militias now in Syria are not Islamic extremists, analysts believe a hard-line jihadist group known as Jabhat al Nusra, which has claimed responsibility for a string of recent suicide attacks across Syria, has close links with al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq. ""Their focus now is on recruiting suicide bombers. They want to copycat the Zarqawi model,"" Noman Benotman, a former Libyan Jihadist now with the Quilliam Foundation in London, told CNN. More: Pro al Qaeda group steps up bombings . The ""Zarqawi model"" refers to the devastating campaign launched by al Qaeda in Mesopotamia leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi after U.S. troops occupied Iraq. At the same time, Kurdish militias now control at least 10 towns and cities in north-eastern Syria, some near the Turkish border -- an issue Lister says is ""of significant concern to Ankara"", which has been battling Kurdish separatists along its borders for decades. Report: Turkey's Kurdish conflict turns deadlier . Is Assad losing control of the Syrian army? Not yet, it seems. Despite some high profile defections, Binnie says ""we haven't seen significant Syrian army units going across to join the rebellion."" Binnie says: ""The speculation is that the Syrian army is focused on keeping itself together more than deploying some of the potentially less reliable units into rebel held areas."" Like most of the nation itself, the majority of Syria's conscripted army is Sunni Muslim. Rather than send some less-than-keen battalions in to kill their own countrymen, Binnie says the approach may be to have the army bombard cities from afar, before sending in loyal militias to do the up-close fighting street to street. ""You give the militias the weapons and the mobility, and you just make sure that the army units which are largely Sunni conscripts just stay together,"" he told CNN. The plan seems to be working; Binnie says many people have been surprised at how well the army has managed to maintain its cohesion during the rebellion. Is Syria going to end up like Libya? The world cheered the fall of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi -- but what has been left in his place are a number of well-armed militias operating beyond the control of a relatively weak central government operating in the capital Tripoli. Analysts don't believe the Assad regime is in danger of collapse any time soon -- Syria's army is bigger and better organized than Gadhafi's was in Libya, and foreign intervention into the civil war seems extremely unlikely at this point. But if the regime does fold at some point, Binnie says the weapons proliferation in Syria is going to be far worse than in Libya. ""Syria has a much bigger military, more missiles and chemical weapons, and the potential for major sectarian violence,"" he said. ""So it's a little like Libya, but potentially much, much worse."" Information from CNN Wires and CNN's Nic Robertson was used in this report.","NATO country Turkey has most powerful military in the region .

"(CNN) -- Commentators usually make too much of presidential debates. Social science data consistently show that there are very few presidential debates that make a huge difference in the dynamics of a campaign -- other than a few exceptions where the race was incredibly narrow, as in 1960 or 2000, and the performance of candidates had some impact. Regardless of whether they are game-changers, the presidential debates are still an important part of the broader narrative about each candidate that voters evaluate when they step into the voting booth in November. More important than doing well is avoiding mistakes. Particularly in the current age of YouTube and nightly political news comedy, any slip-up can become fodder for the 24-hour news cycle. The last thing that a candidate wants to do is provide material for the ""Saturday Night Live"" comedy writers who are eagerly preparing for the next show. The mistakes the presidential candidates have made over the years are numerous. Poor body language has been a common blunder. As much as candidates focus on perfecting the substance of what they say before the cameras, a large number of Americans are really most interested to see how they say it. In 1960, the sweat on Vice President Richard Nixon's brow, his pale skin, and his darting eyes conveyed the image of a politician who could not be fully trusted. Debate coach: Obama, Romney are top performers . In 1992, President George H.W. Bush's decision to glance at his watch while someone asked a question during a town hall meeting with Bill Clinton played into the image that he had little interest or patience with Americans struggling through the recession. Vice President Al Gore's continual sighs during his 2000 debate against George W. Bush conveyed a level of arrogance that made him more difficult to like. In another odd moment, Gore walked right up to Bush as he answered a question, looking like a schoolyard bully trying to stare down his opponent as he spoke. Looks are important, but so are words. The way in which candidates package their ideas can matter very much. Though there is always a temptation for candidates to prove that they know their stuff, sometimes too many words can be deadly. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter provided a lengthy and substantive response when asked about health insurance. Ronald Reagan simply turned to him and said, ""There you go again!"" Reagan used just those few words to raise questions about whether Carter, with all his knowledge, really knew what he was talking about and whether he could be trusted. In 1984, Reagan's scattered response to a question, where he seemed to have trouble keeping his thoughts together and articulating an answer, raised questions about whether he was too old to be president. Reagan recovered, however, turning the tables on his opponent, Walter Mondale, in the following debate, when he said, ""I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."" The manner in which candidates respond often tells voters a lot about the personality of a candidate. In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis answered with clinical detachment when CNN's Bernard Shaw asked whether he would support the death penalty for someone who raped and killed his wife. ""No, I don't, Bernard, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent and I think there are more effective ways to deal with violent crime."" As he reiterated his opposition to the death penalty, Dukakis seemed to miss the fact that the panel wanted to see him wrestle with this difficult choice. The cold response conveyed the image of a politician who lacked warmth or passion. Opinion: When candidates said 'no' to debates . Verbal gaffes also have the capacity to turn a debate into a major campaign headache. Before his 1976 debate against Carter, President Gerald Ford eagerly prepared to respond to criticism, coming from the right and the left, that his policy of detente with the Soviet Union meant that he had essentially accepted the permanence of Communism. When Ford responded to a question by saying that there was ""no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration,"" he meant to say that he didn't accept its legitimacy, nor did the people living under Communist rule. When questioned by a stunned reporter, Ford simply repeated his statement. Not missing a beat, Carter pounced on the statement to raise questions about whether Ford was capable of handling the duties of the office. Presidential debates are full of land mines for the candidates. Even in an age where everything in politics is so scripted and overprepared, the televised debates remain an event where many mistakes are bound to be made. With the television cameras focused on everything the candidate does, and the political-analysis-industrial complex ready to pounced on every word and motion, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, particularly with the race still so close, must enter with caution and be cognizant of how many of their predecessors have stumbled in this arena. For Obama, the challenge will be one of appearance, to convey the impression of strong leadership that his critics say he lacks and that independents are still trying to evaluate. For Romney, he'll need to avoid the kinds of gaffes that have gotten him into repeated trouble and show, through his answers and demeanor, that he is not simply a creature of America's one percent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Top priority for candidates in debates is to avoid mistakes .
He says gaffes have the potential to change how voters view a candidate .
Candidates are viewed not only for what they say but for their body language, he says .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich made short work of opponents Greuther Furth as the Bavarian giants made it a miserable Bundesliga debut for their less illustrious neighbors with a 3-0 win on Saturday. Elsewhere, Borussia Monchengladbach continued their good form from last season with a 2-1 win over Hoffenheim. Bayer Leverkusen struggled in their first game of the season, going down 2-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt despite taking the lead in the first half. Xerdan Shaqiri was handed his debut for Bayern, and tasked with replacing the ill Franck Ribery, with Brazilian defender Dante also making his first start in defence. It was one of Bayern's regulars who opened the scoring, however, with Thomas Muller lashing the ball into the net from close range after a header from debutant Dante. Bayern dominated throughout and doubled their lead in the 59th minute when Croatian striker Mario Mandzukic -- signed in the summer from Wolfsburg -- headed his first goal of the season past goalkeeper Max Grun. Dutch winger got his reward for a fine performance when he added a third in the 78th minute. Robben's cross took a wicked deflection off Furth's defender Nehrig and looped over the unfortunate Grun's head before settling in the back of the net. ""We were very composed, smart and clever too,"" Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes told the club's website. ""Naturally, it's normal that you need a little time to get going. We were playing a promoted team who were still euphoric after what they achieved, and that's never easy."" ""We're aiming very high this season, the team is fired up and extremely motivated, and we're getting through a lot of good work, so I'm not surprised by today's result."" Mike Buskens, Furth coach, admitted that getting a result at Bayern is ""hard"" if they take the lead. ""Once you fall behind to Bayern it's always hard. If you give them space just for an instant, they'll free up Robben with a first-time pass, and suddenly it's 2-0,"" he told the Bayern website. Monchengladbach recovered from their mid week defeat in the champions League qualifiers to claim an opening win over Hoffenheim. Gladbach enjoyed large spells of possession, but couldn't make the breakthrough. In the 33rd minute, Juan Arango delivered a dangerous free kick into the box that tall striker Mike Hanke was able to head into the net to open the scoring. The goal didn't ignite the game, with neither side creating any clear opportunities. However, in the 66 minute Gladbach goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen struggled to hold a shot from Eren Derdiyok and Roberto Frimino pounced to prod the ball home. The game looked to be heading for a draw when Arango stepped up to strike another free kick. This time the Venezuelan curled the ball into the top corner to give his team all three points. Bayer Leverkusen suffered a poor start to life under new full time manager Sami Hyypia. Things looked to be going well for the former Liverpool man, with Stefan Kiessling giving Leverkusen the lead on the half hour mark. Kiessling did well to pounce when Kevin Trapp spilled a shot from Carlos Zambrano. Frankfurt, returning to Germany's top league after a year in Bundesliga.2, rallied well and deserved their equalizer in the 57th minute. Stefan Aigner leveled the score when he shot home after good work from Bastian Oczipka. After the equalizer the game opened up as the two teams went for a winner. Leverkusen went close, and should have taken the lead when Gonzalo Castro fired wide. Frankfurt's Martin Lanig finally settled it in the 82nd minute when he perfectly connected with a cross from Stefano Celozzi to fire an unstoppable header into the Leverkusen net. Nuremberg got their season of to a good start in a poor game against Hamburg. Hanno Balitsch scored the only goal of the game in the 56th minute, poking home the rebound from Per Nilsson's header on to the bar. Hamburg had their chances. Marcel Jansen should have taken a point for the North Germans in the final minute, but his header somehow hit the bar when the back of the net seemed simpler. Fortuna Dusseldorf have signed 18 players over the summer, but only gave debuts to five of them in their starting eleven. The newly promoted side looked the more impressive of the two teams, and a brace from Dani Schahin -- who arrived from Furth this summer -- ensured they took their first points of the season. Both Frieburg and Mainz enjoyed wins in the DFB cup last weekend, but neither could take the three points as the Bundesliga got under way. The two sides were evenly matched, but it was Freiburg's new signing Max Kruse that made the breakthrough in the 48th minute. Mainz attacked from the restart, and eventually got the equalizer in the 65th minute when Nicolai Muller was fouled in the box. The lively Andreas Ivanschitz stepped up to convert the spot kick.","Bayern Munich enjoy opening day win in Bundesliga .

"(CNN) -- What has Big Bird ever done to Mitt Romney?! Did a young Mitt try to meet Big Bird and Big Bird snubbed him? Did Big Bird in essence give Mitt ""the bird'? Or was Romney just channeling his inner Oscar the Grouch? For those who may have missed it, during last night's presidential debate, Mitt Romney said that if elected president he would cut funding to PBS. He even mentioned Big Bird by name. (This is even more shocking because Mitt offered very few specifics on how he would cut the deficit other than slashing support for PBS.) So what happens to Big Bird if Romney has his way? Will Big Bird be laid off? What jobs are out there for an 8-foot-2-inch yellow bird who sings slightly off-key? Will Big Bird become part of the 47% that Romney talked about who believe they are victims and are entitled to government funding? And what about the other Muppets? What will come of them? How will they survive in this tough economic climate? Entertainment: Celebs defend Big Bird . To be honest, out of all of them, I think Bert and Ernie and Guy Smiley (who reminds me of Romney) will probably fare the best. I always suspected they were financially astute. They probably have stocks, mutual funds and maybe even some off-shore investments in places like The Cayman Islands. But what about the rest of the Muppets? Is there any doubt that Cookie Monster is living paycheck to paycheck? Will Cookie Monster turn to crime to support his habit? Will we see The Count standing on the side of the road holding up a big sign that reads: ""Will Count for Food""? I don't even want to think what will happen to Mr. Snuffleupagus. What hope does a slow moving, wooly brown mammoth have in Romney's America? Can't Mitt sit with the Count and try to figure out a way to cut the deficit without cutting out Big Bird? Maybe Mitt Romney and the rest us simply had a different childhood. To be brutally honest, when I was a child, my family couldn't afford day care and often TV was a substitute for that. The neighbor upstairs would be around for emergencies, but my sister and I would be plopped in front of the TV -- and particularly ""Sesame Street."" Political Ticker: Big Bird mentions explode on Facebook . Big Bird and the Muppets were not just a TV show to us -- they were, on some level, our friends. And more important, they taught us things before we ever stepped foot in school. I'm pretty sure I learned about the letter ""C"" from Cookie Monster. And there was the classic ""Three of These Things Belong Together,"" teaching us about organization. And of course, Big Bird sang about the alphabet so that we understood that the ABCs were individual letters and not one long word. Apart from learning, Big Bird and his crew made us laugh -- from Ernie singing about his rubber ducky to Kermit the Frog singing about the struggles of being green. But Mitt Romney -- like the Grinch -- would take that all away from the children of America. OK, to be fair, PBS could exist without federal funding which amounts to about 15% of its total budget. But funding has already been cut, and PBS has said this would eliminate programming in its smaller markets. Romney is not just after Big Bird -- in addition to PBS, he wants to cut all federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Cutting all funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund PBS, would save only $450 million -- not much in the face of trillions of dollars. Is this really the place Mitt Romney should be targeting? Romney said last night he would not raise taxes, would cut corporate taxes, not cut Medicare, not cut the defense budget and still reduce the deficit. Even a Muppet would call this fuzzy math. My hope is that Mitt will take a few minutes off the campaign trail and sit with children who are watching Big Bird, Bert and Ernie and the Cookie Monster. Watch the kids' eyes light up as they see their favorite Muppet on the screen. Hear them giggle to the jokes or sing along in learning about the alphabet. Perhaps then, Mitt Romney's heart will grow three sizes and he will give a reprieve to our 8-foot yellow friend.

"(CNN) -- Ann Romney was magnificent last night addressing the Republican convention. She did everything that party strategists could have desired, presenting herself as an articulate and passionate advocate for her husband, who should now seem more ""likeable"" than he did before her speech. Having once ghost-written words for men who ran for president (Eisenhower, Nixon, and Ford), I admired the craftsmanship: ""His name is Mitt Romney, and you really should get to know him."" She proved herself a great salesperson. Yet he -- not she -- has the name on the November ballot for president of the United States. Similarly, we can admire Michelle Obama, but we will vote for or against her husband. As for Mrs. Romney's reach: This was a convention speech, and conventions stopped being interesting to other than the political class when their outcomes stopped being surprising. Conventions attract the party's faithful. In this election, the polls tell us that there are very few undecided voters. The vast majority of her listeners have already made up their minds. It was different before. My first conventions were in 1952 in Chicago, where both the Republicans and Democrats were meeting. I was a college student working there. When we entered the hall on Day One, we did not know who would be nominated on Day Three. Opinion: Ann Romney stole the show on opening night . That was the last time this happened in American political history. The candidates: Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson. Not every home had a TV set, but every TV set stayed on far into the night. My hunch is that this couldn't be claimed last night. When a long line of speakers preceded Mrs. Romney, my wife and I started channel-surfing. The convention had a lot of competition. Candidates' wives have been a force -- not a factor -- since Lady Bird Johnson was given her own campaign bus and agenda in 1964. It would have been unseemly to have asked Mamie Eisenhower to take to the road or Harry Truman's Bess before her. Pat Nixon, a charming presence, smiled, laughed at the same joke that Dick told in every speech, and otherwise remained silent. Hillary Clinton was briefly a factor in 1992 when Bill announced, ""Buy one, get one free."" The suggestion was instantly shot down, and never resurrected. Politics: Romney gaining buzz among women on Facebook . The genius of the American electorate is in how voters ultimately sort out what is necessary to make a decision, and what is not, discarding the detritus of evening news sound bites, and rhetoric regurgitated on late night panels during the country's endless process of choosing a president. Ronald Reagan was not elected because of his memorable one-liners. ""There you go, again."" Nor was Michael Dukakis defeated because he looked silly riding around in a tank. It's fun to compare the Romneys' touching kiss last night to Al and Tipper's back-bender at the 2000 Democratic convention. These are all part of the show. Some people are well paid to produce the ads and provide the other services for the show. Others are paid to report them. Many enjoy what a newspaper columnist of my youth called ""the great game of politics."" Still, after a half century of observing American voters, I find it uncanny how they always gravitate to what's the most important to them. Which brings us to what the 2012 election is all about. Jobs. Jobs. Jobs. How we feel in our gut about which candidate is more likely to put Americans back to work and revive the economy. There is usually a slight upward bump in the polls after a convention. But it soon settles back down. The only events -- other than what pundits call ""unanticipated consequences"" such as a homeland terrorist attack -- that could influence the outcome will be the debates where the candidates directly challenge each other. Opinion: Where Ann Romney's speech veered off-track . If Mitt Romney wins, a majority prefer his economic message. If Mitt Romney loses, he will still know that no other candidate's wife ever worked so hard to explain her husband to the American people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Hess.","Stephen Hess: Ann Romney did great job with speech; should help with Mitt's ""likability""
He says conventions mainly for the political class; most voters won't have watched .
He says wives can be a force, not a factor; voters ultimately vote what's important to them .
Hess: Political process is a show; whoever persuades voters on jobs issue will win ."
"(CNN) -- In my previous CNN opinion piece, I explained to readers my reasons why President Obama should not be re-elected. Many keen readers responded: If those are the reasons to vote against Obama, then what are the reasons to vote for Mitt Romney? Opinion: Why debate is crucial for Obama, too . This is an entirely fair question; Romney's obligation is to make the case to the American people why he should be president. Here, then, are my reasons to vote for Romney. Business and management career success . The American economy is in desperate need of a turnaround artist. Mitt Romney has made his career in the private sector doing exactly that -- turning around failing business and enterprises. During his time at Bain Capital, Romney was responsible for building companies that Americans shop at everyday -- Staples, Domino's Pizza, Sports Authority, and Brookstone. Of course, not all of his investments were successful and some companies failed, but on the whole, Bain Capital's returns for its investors were nothing short of stellar. In its independent analysis of Bain's record, The Wall Street Journal reported, ""Bain produced about $2.5 billion in gains for its investors in the 77 deals, on about $1.1 billion invested. Overall, Bain recorded roughly 50% to 80% annual gains in this period, which experts said was among the best track records for buyout firms in that era."" How to watch, clip and share the debate . Romney was one of the most successful venture capitalists of the late 1980s and 1990s. The Obama administration attacks Romney's business career, but praises that of billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. That's quite the double standard. Perhaps, they should heed President Bill Clinton, who called Romney's business record ""sterling."" Opinion: Obama, light a cig; Romney, throw deep . Romney's success didn't end at Bain. In 1999, he left to rescue the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics from the verge of collapse. Romney took control and managed the Olympics from debt and disaster into a national success. If Romney can thrive in the private sector, where 5 of 10 small businesses fail within five years, and the public sector, where regulations and inefficiencies often stifle success, surely he can help the U.S. economy back to its feet. Executive governing experience . Romney took office as governor of Massachusetts in 2003, at a time when the state was undergoing its own recession. After the dot-com bubble burst, Massachusetts lost more than 200,000 jobs and had a $3 billion budget shortfall. Romney closed the budget deficit without raising state taxes, but by raising fees and closing tax loopholes. Although the number of jobs created during his term was ranked near the bottom compared with other states, Massachusetts did progress from shedding jobs to creating tens of thousands. The unemployment rate dropped from 5.6% to 4.7%. And he accomplished all this with a Democrat legislature. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Massachusetts topped the nation in eighth grade math and reading scores in 2007, the last year of Romney's term. While Romney did inherit what was arguably already the best school system in the country, he continued his own conservative reforms and was a good steward of the state education system in place. Today it consistently ranks as the best state education system in the United States. And thanks to Romney's state-led health care reform, in 2012, Massachusetts had the lowest percentage of uninsured, at 4.9%, according to a Gallup survey. Character and leadership . To hear many in the mainstream media describe Mitt Romney, he's out-of-touch, stiff, insensitive and uncaring. In reality, Mitt Romney, the man, husband and leader, is a deeply benevolent, compassionate, and generous man.Â But he must tell his story. For example, in July 1996, Romney closed down all of Bain Capital and sent his employees to New York City to search for the 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at Bain Capital. She had snuck off to a rave party in New York City and had been missing for three days. Romney set up a command search center in New York City, coordinated with the New York Police Department, put up posters all over the city, and sent out alerts. It wasn't long before the young girl was found in a basement suffering from ecstasy withdrawal. Referring to Romney's efforts, Gay said: ""It was the most amazing thing, and I'll never forget this to the day I die."" Opinion: Why you shouldn't vote for Obama . At the Republican Convention, Ted and Pat Oparowski told the tear-jerking story of their 14-year-old son, David, who was diagnosed with terminal Hodgkin's disease. Romney visited him frequently, becoming a close friend. At David's request, he wrote the young man's will and gave the eulogy at his funeral. These are the untold stories of a good and decent man. In 2011, Romney and his wife, Ann, gave almost 30% of their income to charity, more than $4 million. As Romney likes to say, compassion isn't measured by welfare or food stamps, but by the ability to lift people off welfare and food stamps. Each year he gives millions of his own dollars to help people in such a way. Romney's plan . After four years of President Obama's failed economic leadership, Romney would bring to the White House a specific, detailed plan for returning to fiscal responsibility and job creation. His plan would cut federal spending as a share of GDP to 20% by 2016. It would reform our complex tax code by reducing tax rates 20% across the board while eliminating loopholes, specifically those for the highest earners, and maintaining revenue neutrality. It would also reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, now the highest in the world, to 25%. Under a Romney administration, the largest drivers of our debt would be reformed by giving more choice and responsibility to individuals rather than bureaucrats for managing their Medicare and Social Security. In the case of Medicaid, it would be block granted and sent back to the states. Romney's plan will reduce onerous regulations and taxes, like Obamacare, and usher in a new era of fiscal certainty for business owners and entrepreneurs. In debates, presidential candidates' tics and tells matter . Romney will also champion energy independence, will approve the Keystone pipeline and stop the Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory war on coal. Borrowing from his experience in Massachusetts, Romney will push for more school choice for parents and students, performance pay for teachers, and, with 3 million skilled jobs going begging, new skills training for skilled workers. Finally, his pick of Rep. Paul Ryan as his vice presidential candidate cements his conservative credentials as a fiscal reformer bent on tackling the debt and entitlements, something our current president ignored. Romney's experience and success in both government and business, his leadership in public office, as well as his compassion in private, make him a man qualified and equipped to lead America's comeback, certainly more qualified than Barack Obama before his candidacy for the White House in 2008. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","William Bennett says Romney's business acumen gives him an advantage at fixing economy .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Bangkok faces the highest flood levels yet and is preparing for the worst, the governor of the Thai capital told CNN. Residents are urged to flee the rising floodwaters, which have already forced the closure of Bangkok's Don Muang airport and the evacuation of flood victims who have taken refuge there. Thailand's government has declared a five-day public holiday in flood-affected provinces to try to encourage people to seek safety elsewhere before high tides expected this weekend. But Bangkok Gov. Sukhumbhand Paripatra told CNN the authorities could not evacuate a whole city and it was difficult to persuade the Thai people to leave their homes, despite the risk. CNNGo: Updated info for tourists . ""Apparently there will be large volume of water runoff coming toward the city tonight onwards, and over the weekend,"" he said. ""At the point of high tide, it will be very high, the highest this year. We are bracing for the worse."" Thongthong Chantharangsu, a spokesman for Thailand's Flood Relief Operations Center, appealed on TV for Bangkok residents to head to the countryside. Floodwaters extend from Rangsit, north of Bangkok, to Don Muang airport and Yingcharoen Market, state-run news agency MCOT reported. The water has reached 30cm (12 inches) in places and is overflowing on to sidewalks and some roads, causing problems for small vehicles and leading to traffic congestion, the agency said. In a televised address Tuesday night, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said the capital could be submerged by as much as 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of water. Of particular concern were areas along the Chao Phraya River, which winds through the capital and is expected to overwhelm embankments this weekend. The Airports of Thailand declared Don Muang airport, which primarily services domestic flights, closed Tuesday night, after floodwaters flowed onto runways and affected the lighting. Nok Air, which usually operates from Don Muang, was forced to cancel flights but should be able to run an almost normal schedule by Friday after moving its operations to the main Suvarnabhumi Airport, the airline's chief executive Patee Sarasin said Wednesday. Some 3,000 Nok Air passengers were affected by flight cancellations Tuesday, he said. The flood relief operation will continue to be based at the airport, the Thai government said Wednesday. More than 600 prisoners held at Bang Kwang Central Prison have been evacuated, according to the Department of Corrections. The high-security prison has about 4,000 inmates, the chief of the prison said, some of them high-profile. The floods have also forced the Dusit Zoo to evacuate some animals, including goat antelope and Sika deer, to a zoo in the countryside, according to Dusit Zoo's chief, Karnchai Saenwong. The U.S. ambassador to Thailand, Kristie A. Kenny, said the crisis was slow moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. The United States has already provided civilian relief resources including water pumps, purifiers and life vests, she said, and two U.S. helicopters are helping the Thai military survey the extent of the flooding. Nationwide, the floods have killed 373 people and affected more than 9.5 million people, authorities said. The public holiday announced Tuesday will be from Thursday to next Monday and will be effective in 21 provinces, including Bangkok, that are still under water, a government spokeswoman said. The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede in some areas. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge. Overall damage from the floods has risen and could top $6 billion, with the worst yet to come as the waters destroy shops and paralyze factories nationwide, the Thai Finance Ministry said. Thailand derives a significant portion of its revenue from tourism, which has been diminished by the flooding. CNN's Elizabeth Yuan, Kocha Olarn and Paula Hancocks contributed to this report .","NEW: Bangkok's governor warns of the highest water levels in next few days .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- North Korea requested permission from Iraq this week to fly a plane through its airspace to Syria, an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told CNN on Friday. Al-Maliki rejected the request out of suspicion the plane would be carrying weapons, said adviser Ali al-Mousawi. The prime minister talked by phone with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Friday afternoon, officials said. Biden asked Iraq for help in stopping weapons from reaching Syria, according to a statement released by his office, and stressed to the Iraqi prime minister ""the need to prevent any state from taking advantage of Iraq's territory or airspace to send weapons to Syria."" Al-Maliki ""expressed the Iraqi government's discomfort with some informal U.S parties of stirring suspicions about Iraq's position toward the Syrian crisis,"" and that Iraq has held a ""firm position in rejecting any weapon supplies or violent activity over Iraq's territories or its airspaces,"" according to a release from his office. ""Al-Maliki reiterated the position of the Iraqi government based on the need to find a peaceful political solution for the Syrian crisis and its rejection to supply ammunitions to any party involved in the Syrian conflicts,"" the release said. Opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's rule are concerned about the shuttling of arms to his government by entities such as Iran. Iraq borders Syria and Iran. Al-Assad magazine interview . Earlier, Syria's besieged president slammed the rebels battling his government forces, but said the ""door to dialogue is open."" ""Dialogue with the opposition is the only way out to address the crisis,"" al-Assad said in a magazine interview published Friday. The cries for freedom and democracy that spread across the Arab world last year also reached Syria. That set the wheels in motion for a standoff that morphed into a civil war between the al-Assad government and a burgeoning rebel movement. More than 26,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the one-and-half-year-long conflict, according to opposition activists. Al-Assad, who blames the violence on terror groups, told Egypt's Al-Ahram al-Arabi magazine that ""armed men are engaged in terrorism against all of the state's institutions."" ""They have no support in the society. Rather, they have harmed the interests of the people by targeting the infrastructure that serves the people and killing innocent Syrians. Ultimately, they will not emerge victorious,"" he said. He said backers of these forces ""think the only solution is through a Libyan scenario."" That's a reference to rebel forces, with foreign backing, toppling Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and his government. ""But a decisive end (to the crisis) will take some time, of course. However, the door to dialogue is open and we have offered several initiatives for amnesty for all of those who put down their arms in order to encourage dialogue,"" al-Assad said. Libyan fighting in Syria symbolizes fears . The president took jabs at Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar -- all supporters of the opposition. ""They suddenly saw money in their hands after a long period of poverty and think they can change (the role of) history and geography, and play a regional role,"" al-Assad said, referring to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Before the Syrian conflict started last year, Saudi Arabia served only as a ""mediator with the West that does not appreciate the axis of resistance against Zionism advocated by Syria,"" the president said. ""Let me correct a prevalent idea that Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt are the triangular axis of stability in the region. This is not true. It has always been, and will remain, Syria, Iraq and Egypt,"" he said. As for Qatar, it ""uses the power of money and revolves in the orbit of the West by providing weapons and money to terrorists to repeat the Libyan scenario,"" al-Assad said. And Turkey, he said, has ""lost a lot"" by taking its stance on Syria. ""They are unconcerned about the interests of its people, focusing solely on its ambitions that include the new Ottoman Empire,"" he said. Here's a roundup of other developments in Syria's conflict: . Mass grave, massacres reported in Damascus area . Twenty-five ""bound and blindfolded"" bodies were found in a mass grave in the al-Qadam area of Damascus Friday, Syria's state news agency said. Authorities blamed the deaths on ""armed terrorist groups."" The government also said its armed forces ""killed a number of terrorists"" in the Damascus area town of Beit Jen. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said regime forces conducted a ""massacre"" in the suburb of Buwaida. Seventeen people were stabbed to death after soldiers stormed the area, it said. The LCC said the 17 were among 117 people killed across Syria on Friday. Forty-eight deaths occurred in the Damascus area. Seventeen people were killed in Aleppo and 15 each in Homs and Idlib provinces. Violence also raged in Daraa, Raqqa, Deir Ezzor, Latakia and Hama provinces. Opposition figures disappear upon arrival in Syria . Two members of the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change -- an opposition group -- and a friend who came to pick them up disappeared shortly after leaving the airport in Damascus, the group said. ""The National Coordination Body's Exile Branch holds the kidnappers, whoever they be, completely responsibility -- ethically, legally, and politically -- for any physical or mental harm done. We demand an explanation for why there has been no communication, whatever the motives and reasons. We demand they be immediately returned safely to their families,"" the NCB said in a statement. Syrian state news blamed terrorists for kidnapping the men. Help for Syrians . The U.N. refugee agency says it is making progress relocating Syrian refugees in Lebanon. It is also working to enroll refugee children in Lebanese and Iraqi schools, the agency said Friday. Nearly 73,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon have registered or are awaiting registration with the United Nations. There are now more than 29,000 Syrians in Iraq. A second Russian plane transporting 38 tons of food arrived in Damascus Friday, according to the Syrian Arab News Agency, which reported the arrival of a similar shipment Thursday. Christians in Syria fear uncertain future . CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported from Baghdad and Nic Robertson reported from Damascus.

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams gave an awesome demonstration of power tennis to demolish Maria Sharapova 6-0 6-1 in the Olympic women's singles final at Wimbledon Saturday. The 30-year-old American was backing up her Wimbledon triumph last month on the same grass courts and never allowed her Russian opponent the chance to settle. Victory came after just 63 minutes and fittingly with yet another thunderous ace to complete a one-sided match. Williams has joined Steffi Graf as the only players in tennis history to win all four grand slam titles and the Olympic singles title, the so-called Golden Slam. Having won the Olympic doubles twice with sister Venus, she is also the first woman to achieve that triple feat. Williams believes it ranks among her greatest achievements. ""This one is so high up there, being Olympic gold champion, being Golden Slam champion singles and doubles, that's pretty awesome,"" she told gathered reporters. Three aces in her opening service game set the course of the match and she immediately broke French Open champion Sharapova in the next game. Almost total domination followed and it was not until the ninth game of the match that Sharapova got on the scoreboard. She threatened on Williams' next service game, but the 14-time grand slam champion won it to lead 4-1 before breaking Sharapova yet again. World number four Williams has beaten Sharapova, current world number one Victoria Azarenka and two other former world number ones in Caroline Wozniacki and Jelena Jankovic on her way to the title, dropping only 17 games in six matches. After losing to Virginie Razzano in the first round of the French Open, doubters were writing off Williams, but she has responded in emphatic style with her fifth Wimbledon crown and now more Olympic glory. Azarenka beat Maria Kirilenko of Russia 6-3 6-4 in the battle for bronze. The American gold rush at SW19 continued Saturday as brothers Bob and Mike Bryan won their first Olympic title with a 6-4 7-6 victory over French second seeds Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Michael Llodra in the men's doubles final. The Bryan brothers had taken the bronze medal in the men's doubles in Beijing four years ago, but made no mistake this time.","Serena Williams wins women's singles title at London Olympics .

"Sydney (CNN) -- Australia has a female prime minister. Her name is Julia Eileen Gillard. Australia also has a shock jock commercial radio broadcaster and his name is Alan Belford Jones. His dislike of the prime minister is as legendary as his typically adoring, right-wing retiree listeners are loyal. The two have been involved in an almighty collision that is proving commercially and politically disastrous for Jones and a likely polling gift for Gillard. Jones is a former coach of the Australian National Rugby Union team who sought Liberal Party pre-selection in the late 1970s. He is also a determined climate change denier who 13 years ago was investigated over allegations of accepting commercial support from companies in exchange for favorable comment. Despite this, the take-no-prisoner broadcaster remains one of Australia's most popular and highly paid radio announcers. Since she snatched the premiership from Kevin Rudd in 2010, Gillard claims she has been the target of persistent misogynist invective and otherwise abusive treatment that some commentators agree would not have been directed at a male incumbent. If not her hair, then her distinctive drawl, physical attributes, and dress style have attracted negative comment in mainstream press and on social media, along with her de facto relationship with Tim Mathieson, a former hairdresser who is now in real estate. However, in the past week, the disrespect flew off the Richter scale and the culprit was Jones. Having ruled the airwaves for more than two decades with a very large, if aging audience, Jones has enraged and offended much of Australia. He took aim at the most tender and raw of emotions: the prime minister's palpable grief at the recent death of her beloved father, John Gillard, after a long illness. ""The old man died a few weeks ago of shame,"" Jones told a gathering of the Sydney University Young Liberals a week ago. ""To think that he had a daughter who told lies every time she stood for Parliament,"" he is heard saying on a recording of the event taken by a journalist from Rupert Murdoch's News Limited paper The Sunday Telegraph. The ""lie"" Jones referred to was Prime Minister Gillard's promise before the 2010 election that no government she led would introduce a carbon tax. However, Gillard abandoned her stance when the election produced a hung parliament. Jones has led several anti-carbon tax rallies and he has said that the prime minister should be better known as Ju-LIAR. He has suggested the guillotine be brought back to deal with her and that she be thrown to the sea in a chaff bag. Later he claimed that Gillard, along with a handful of other female political leaders, was ""destroying the joint."" Jones claims his attacks on Gillard are squarely aimed at her policies, but some commentators, and Gillard herself, suspect that his barbs have more to do with her gender. His claim that Gillard's father died of shame was the last straw for campaigners on social media, many companies that advertise on Jones' show and some regional radio stations that buy his daily show. A significant number of major companies, amongst them Mercedes Benz and supermarket giant Woolworths, have pulled valuable advertising from his show. On its Twitter profile, in response to a social media campaign, home wares store Freedom noted: ""You spoke, we listened. We do not support the comments made by Alan Jones. We have pulled our advertising off the air."" Those which have not yet withdrawn their advertising dollars from the network are under intense pressure to follow suit. Jones for his part has been less than contrite. In a rambling 45-minute media conference the day after the content of his speech was made public, he insisted he was merely ""repeating"" a comment he had heard at a social function. He said he had phoned Gillard to apologize, but she had refused to take his call. The prime minister said Wednesday that she wouldn't be speaking to Jones, nor would she appear on his show. Two days after apologizing, Jones was back on air and his followers were backing him all the way. Even those who thought his comment offensive and distasteful threw their weight behind Jones: ""I believe you were wrong in what you said, but I am so proud to have a man stand up and apologize,"" one listener told him. Condemnation from the prime minister's Labor Party was swift. The leader of the opposition Liberal-National Party Coalition, Tony Abbott, a staunch friend of Jones, issued a brief statement, saying ""Alan's remarks regarding the PM were completely out of line."" ""It's good that he's recognized this and apologized for them,"" he added. Abbott now faces intense political pressure to go further and prevent Jones from attending any Liberal Party functions. It has been a difficult few weeks for the Coalition leader who, just a few weeks ago, was riding high in the polls. He has battled a perception that he has difficulty relating to women. He stands accused of being a misogynist himself over an alleged incident 30 years ago in which he's alleged to have punched the wall behind a female candidate after she won a student council election. Abbott denies the incident ever happened. What impact the Jones affair will have on his polling is yet to be seen. While many commentators believe the Gillard's decision not to speak with Jones, on or off air, could result in a lift in the polls, others think if her cabinet supporters protest too loudly, the gains will be lost. A reader poll in one newspaper showed an overwhelming desire for Jones' employer, the Macquarie Media Network, to sack him. And, at the time of writing, more than 100,000 people had signed an online petition calling for his dismissal. Commentators say that it's unlikely he'll go. Jones is the company's fourth largest shareholder and as stockbroker Roger Coleman told the Crikey website: ""His key listeners are over 55, they are right wing. They agree with him that Julia Gillard is a bitch and witch. There is no mismatch between him and his listeners."" Although the advertisers will likely return to the country's highest rating broadcaster, they might at the very least have cause to question Jones' dictum that it is women who are ""destroying the joint."" Gillard may prove the polls wrong too and end up running the joint for another three years after the 2013 election.","Popular Australian shock jock Alan Jones in clash with Prime Minister .

"(CNN) -- Joss Whedon's name has been flung around the movie stratosphere with Thor-worthy momentum since his superhero blockbuster ""The Avengers"" staked a claim on the box office this summer. But the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Angel"" and ""Firefly"" creator still feels relatively nervous, modest, yenta-ish and excited when it comes to film festivals. His equally modest, black-and-white Shakespeare adaptation ""Much Ado About Nothing"" premieres Saturday at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. The festival runs from Thursday through Sept. 16. ""I've been to two festivals in my life, and I've never been to Toronto. I haven't really been making festival movies. This is new territory for me,"" Whedon told EW.com. ""I'm kind of festive. Toronto has an amazing rep. The entire cast is coming. That's so exciting for me, since they're all my buddies. I would like to find a distributor and would really like to see other people's movies."" What's next for Joss Whedon? ""Much Ado,"" starring ""Angel"" alums Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof as sparring lovers Benedick and Beatrice, and ""Firefly"" alum Nathan Fillion as comically incompetent constable Dogberry, is as far from ""The Avengers'"" large sets and booming action as you can get. The movie was shot over 12 days at Whedon's home in Santa Monica, Calif. It's the first feature from Whedon's mini studio Bellwether Pictures, which he created with his wife Kai Cole. Acker, who has flown somewhat under the radar since her role as wide-eyed Winifred Burkle on ""Angel,"" did a reading of ""Much Ado"" with Denisof years ago at Whedon's house. Hopefully the film version will land Acker back in the spotlight. ""Amy's the best actress I've ever worked with. Get ready for an ace star performance. People were speechless,"" gushed Whedon. ""We started the home Shakespeare readings 10 years ago or more. It was season five or season six of Buffy. Sarah Michelle Gellar did not do the readings. A smattering of writers and actors from the shows did them. With Much Ado, eventually the technology changed to the point where you can make a movie, and not just a stage reading, but an actual production at home."" As for Fillion, Whedon said the Castle star had never read Shakespeare, before filming the movie, and that Fillion was scared. ""But he was so assured, and so funny. People are thinking spinoff!"" said Whedon. Whedon also mused about the connections between Shakespeare and ""The Avengers,"" which has grossed more than $650 million domestically at the box office since its May debut, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com. Apparently a knack for dry, snarky, intricate language and twisting, turning plot lines spans generations, TV, movies and plays. ""There's a reason Tony Stark makes fun of Thor, and mentions Shakespeare in the Park in The Avengers,"" said Whedon. ""It's great to play high drama and comedy alongside a modern story. Shakespeare was shameless about that stuff, pop culture references. Much Ado is very much in the vein of the movies I make, which surprised me. It's not that different from The Avengers. It's about finding why everyone is in the movie. What makes Ursula the maid shine? It was oddly similar."" As for making other independent films, with Whedon's mega stuffed Marvel schedule working on ""The Avengers"" sequel and TV spinoff ""S.H.I.E.L.D.,"" will there still be time, or even room in his Marvel contract, for the multitasking writer-director to feed into Bellwether Pictures? Whedon said yes. ""The agreement with Marvel carved out room for movies like 'Much About Do' and 'In Your Eyes,' which my wife produced, which we've finished post on. And Dr. Horrible 2,"" said Whedon. ""Anything that is not movie and TV. I can do web, comic books, macramÃ©, art."" See full story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- In his September 4 op-ed, Jack Schlossberg presents his case that young Americans should cast their ballots for President Obama this fall. Published on the same day it was widely reported that the national debt had hit $16 trillion, his piece is as ill-timed as it is unconvincing. Seeking to speak to and for his generation, he characterizes Obama as ""our biggest ally in Washington."" He neglects, of course, to recount the harsh realities of the Obama economy. Instead, his message rests on the flimsy notion that we should hang on a little bit longer because enduring change takes time. You may be wondering what happened to ""We can't wait"" and ""Yes we can."" Schlossberg concedes that we're ""a little more cynical,"" but contends that ""just because our politics and government can disappoint us sometimes doesn't mean we should forget how far we've come."" How far we've come? Unfortunately, such an argument demonstrates a sloppiness with the facts. Take, for instance, the fact that unemployment has remained above 8% since the beginning of Obama's term. Or, according to this analysis, that half of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed Or that under Obama, the national debt has risen $5 trillion. Or that Obama presided over the first credit downgrade in American history. I could go on. The point is, these facts are overwhelming. And they are neither fair to young Americans nor signs of the progress for which we yearn. Rather, they are the residue of generational theft, of promises unmet, of false hopes and of crushed dreams. In a word, travesty. To argue otherwise is to fall out of a fairy tale. Schlossberg begins his piece with ""The Catcher in the Rye's"" Holden Caulfield. He compares Caulfield's desire to escape phonies to young people's support for Barack Obama in his first presidential campaign. But the problem with that analysis is that it's four years out of date. In 2008, Obama regaled us with promises of hope and change, but his time in office has exposed the emptiness of these promises. And there's more than meets to the eye to the president's self-proclaimed achievements. While his allies may credit his health care law with allowing members of my generation to stay on our parents' health care until we're in our mid-20s, the real question is, why can't we find jobs in the first place? Obama regards students as beneficiaries of his achievements. Schlossberg praises the president's ""insistence on keeping student interest rates low,"" but that hasn't kept student loan debt from reaching record levels. Schlossberg's discussion of Obama's energy policy is equally selective. He talks about the president's ""investments in clean energy projects and jobs,"" but fails to mention that some of these ""investments"" came at a high price and on the dime of taxpayers. The saying goes that brevity is the soul of wit, so this argument merits a one-word refutation: Solyndra. But of all of Schlossberg's claims, perhaps the most misguided is the notion that Obama has displayed political courage in the White House. He has refused to reform entitlements in a way that will ensure they remain solvent for future generations -- which is to say, us. Instead, he started a brand new trillion-dollar entitlement program in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, an unaffordable government takeover of our nation's health care system. His fiscal stewardship has been nothing short of a disaster. Four consecutive years of trillion-dollar deficits isn't courageous; it's immoral. Schlossberg does get one thing correct, however: Part of growing up is coming to terms with heartbreaking truths. But in this case, it's about coming to terms with the fact that Obama has had his chance to lead and his policies have failed. We don't have to fall into line once again only to be taken for granted. We can vote for a new direction. We can reward truth-telling. We can elect Mitt Romney.

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- More than 100 Sri Lankan soldiers were killed and another 400 wounded Wednesday when troops attempted to advance toward a stronghold of the Tamil Tigers rebel organization, highly placed army sources told CNN. Sri Lankan soldiers patrol the frontline on the Jaffna peninsula, the scene of fierce fighting. The incident happened before dawn, when troops manning a defense line in the northern Sri Lanka village of Muhamalai attempted to advance toward the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi in the northern Wanni region, the sources said. The village is on a thin isthmus linking mainland Sri Lanka to the Jaffna peninsula. A defense line bordered by the Kilaly Lagoon on the west and the Indian Ocean on the east divides the rebel-controlled area from those held by the government's security forces. Troops made an attempt to open a third front in the Wanni region by advancing south, Army officials said. Their ultimate aim was to reach Kilinochchi -- the power center of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil, better known as the Tamil Tigers. ""The rebels feigned they had withdrawn from their first line of defenses in well-dug-out trenches,"" one official said. ""After the troops backed by battle tanks reached the area, the rebels sprung a fierce attack."" The incident deals a setback to military efforts to weaken the Tamil Tigers. Government leaders and military commanders vowed early this year to ""eliminate"" the rebels by the end of the year, but later extended the deadline into 2009. Until Wednesday, the heavy fighting had remained focused in the western coastal town of Mannar and the northeastern coastal area of Weli Oya. Local and foreign media are barred from visiting battlegrounds, except on conducted tours, and casualty counts from the military and the rebels are often exaggerated. Initial information on the Wednesday incident came from the Media Centre for National Security, the only government agency disseminating information on the separatist war. In its latest update, it says 43 soldiers and more than 100 rebels have been killed, while 120 soldiers are injured and 33 are missing. Independent verification of claims made by the center is often difficult. The army sources also told CNN that at least 30 soldiers were reported missing in action. Rebel sources reported some soldiers remained lying on the battleground, but did not divulge a number. Some of the injured were flown to Colombo hospitals. Officials appealed to the public on radio and television to donate blood. E-mail to a friend .","Tamil rebels and government troops wage fierce battle along frontline .

"(CNN) -- North Korea may be on the brink of another famine as a result of last year's devastating floods, the worldwide increase in food prices, and a malnourished population, the United Nations warned on Thursday. According to a U.N. report, nearly 40 percent of young children are ""chronically malnourished."" ""North Korea ... faces a dire food shortage,"" U.N. World Food Program spokesman Paul Risley said at a Bangkok, Thailand, news conference. ""Because of high global food prices it will be very difficult for the government of DPRK to purchase food on global markets to make up the difference."" The Democratic Republic of North Korea is still recovering from a famine in the 1990s that is believed to have killed about a million people and left many children permanently stunted, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Nearly 40 percent of North Korea's young children remain ""chronically malnourished,"" according to a recent survey by the WFP and UNICEF. And this year, the isolated communist country is expected to see the largest harvest deficit since 2001, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. ""We're very concerned that this year the food shortfall of 1,600,000 tons of rice and wheat will mean that malnutrition will increase and that children will receive less food than they are really needing to receive,"" Risley said. Potatoes and eggs are luxuries for most people in North Korea, who must spend a third of their monthly income for two pounds (1 kilogram) of rice, according to the WFP. The price of rice and other staple foods has doubled over the past year, it said. ""Its harvest in the past year was virtually destroyed by floods that occurred in August of 2007,"" Risley said. ""What this means is the country now does not have enough food to feed its people and it has not received substantial contributions from South Korea as it has in past years."" Part of the problem is that North Korea's reclusive government led by Kim Jong Il has refused outside aid and regularly denies that his country has suffered from famine. The WFP said Pyongyang significantly cut the U.N. group's operations in 2006. Before the cut, the program had been assisting more than 6 million North Koreans; now it can only help a little more than a million of the most vulnerable population, mostly women and children. ""The food security situation in the DPRK is clearly bad and getting worse,"" said Tony Banbury, WFP's regional director for Asia. ""It is increasingly likely that external assistance will be urgently required to avert a serious tragedy."" E-mail to a friend .","World Food Program warns of looming food crisis in North Korea .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Three members of the Russian punk rock band Pussy Riot pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of hooliganism after performing a song criticizing President Vladimir Putin in a Moscow church, Russia's state news agency reported. The charge, which carries a potential seven-year sentence, stems from an unusual performance they gave in February. ""Mother Mary please drive Putin away,"" the band screamed, their faces covered in neon masks, inside Moscow's Christ Savior Cathedral. The anonymous, feminist protest band called it a punk prayer. Three of the women were arrested soon after, and have been in custody ever since. Two of the women have young children. Read more: Jailed punk band Pussy Riot pushes free speech limits in Russia . On Monday, band members apologized to Orthodox Christian believers if they felt they had been insulted, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, Maria Alyokhina, 24, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 29, grinned at cameras as police brought them from a van into the court, waving their handcuffed arms behind their backs. They appeared in court in an enclosure that forced them to bend down to speak through small window to be heard. Amnesty International said Monday the trial ""never should have taken place."" John Dalhuisen of Amnesty said the singers had been making ""a legitimate protest -- this is not a criminal offense. They must be released immediately."" ""They dared to attack the two pillars of modern Russian establishment -- the Kremlin and the Orthodox Church. While many may have found their act offensive, the sentence of up to seven years in prison they may expect on the charges of hooliganism is wildly out of all proportion,"" he said. Pussy Riot member Tolokonnikova is bearing up well in jail, her husband, Peter Verzilov, told CNN earlier this month. ""She looks very good and she's taking it as she's supposed to take it -- as very political and very artistic; as a very solid, creative and powerful person,"" he said, based on fleeting glimpses of her in court. Pussy Riot specializes in sudden, often illegal public performances, including one in Moscow's Red Square. ""We did realize that at some point, (they) could get arrested. That was always a possibility, but of course no one expected the arrest would come after this particular performance,"" Verzilov said. The punk prayer was inspired by the women's anger about the relationship between the Russian government and the Orthodox Church. The Orthodox leader Patriarch Kyril has been widely reported as saying Putin's years in power have been a miracle from God. But the band's behavior in one of Russia's most sacred cathedrals has outraged many of the country's faithful. ""This is a disgusting thing to do,"" one woman told CNN. ""They should go to jail,"" said another. ""A year or two. Let them to think about their behavior."" But even some of those who were offended believe the women should not be in jail. ""If necessary, God will punish them,"" said one man. ""It must be not be cruel punishment."" The women also have passionate supporters who say they are victims of political persecution. Verzilov says he has told his 4-year-old daughter who's to blame. ""Gerra knows that Putin has put Nadia in prison and he's not letting her out. We have to find a way to defeat him to free Nadia,"" he said. The Russian president hasn't commented on the case. Pussy Riot is only one small part of the recent anti-Putin protest movement. But the decision to jail and prosecute these women has ensured that the band's colorful face masks have become one of the opposition's most powerful symbols. CNN's Phil Black, Alla Eshchenko and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Pussy Riot sang an anti-Putin song in Moscow's Christ Savior Cathedral .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney had another debate Saturday night in which he didn't make many mistakes, was smooth, knowledgeable, even presidential. It was his worst performance yet. The game has changed, and someone forgot to tell him. He is behind in national polls, and this time it's serious: His main rival, Newt Gingrich, is polling well not just in Iowa, but also across the country. Saturday night's debate was on a major network, with a wide audience, in the first state in the nation to hold a caucus -- and there is only one more debate before that voting. The conclusion is inescapable. Romney blew it. Let me reiterate something I've said before (it can't be overstated): Your debating strategy must change based on your position. If the debate team I coach is a heavy favorite in a debate, I coach the debaters to keep doing the same things that made them the favorite. But if we're an underdog, we will approach the debate with an entirely different argumentative strategy. Mitt Romney is still debating the way he was six months ago. He's debating not to lose instead of debating to win. And that's a mistake, given the rise and potential staying power of Gingrich. Romney committed three major errors in Saturday evening's debate. And what is maddening is that they were all opportunities for him to differentiate himself from Gingrich -- but he failed each time. The first error was when George Stephanopoulos directed a possible bonanza question to Romney. He asked Romney if he was more conservative (his potential weakness) and more electable (his potential strength) than Gingrich. Perfect softball. In one answer, Romney could erase doubts about his conservatism for the base of Republican voters and he could talk about how he is the only candidate who can beat Obama (as evidenced in polls). Romney's answer? Moon mining. Seriously. After starting with some generic answer about the direction of the country, his first specific example was that he was different from Gingrich on moon colonies. ""We could start with his idea to have a lunar colony that would mine minerals from the moon. I'm not in favor of spending that kind of money to do that."" That was his ""go to"" answer. Awful. Romney never mentioned his conservative principles or background, and he never attacked Gingrich on electability. Not even once. Romney's second mistake was that he was shallow when he should have been on the attack. Gingrich recently said the Palestinians were an ""invented"" people. While Romney held his own in an exchange on this issue, saying he was not a rhetorical ""bomb thrower"" who would hurt our allies, he did not take the argument as far as he should have. One of Gingrich's perceived weaknesses is his imprudence, rhetorical and otherwise. Romney could have hammered home an argument that Gingrich would be a poor chief statesman because of his often-inappropriate outspokenness. Finally, when the other candidates teamed up on both Gingrich and Romney, as they did with health care (Bachmann's new angle of attack for the evening was calling the two ""Newt Romney""), Romney needed to immediately separate himself from Gingrich. Why? If Gingrich is leading, and the voters think he and Romney are identical, then why would they vote for Romney? They wouldn't. But Romney didn't ever get the separation he needed. The teamwork was effective, and both Gingrich and Romney were grouped together time and time again. This did not help Romney. For his part, Gingrich seemed to escape the other candidates' criticism, partly because it was split (some attacks were aimed at Romney), and because the discussion did not stay on one topic for long enough to make Gingrich defend his positions in depth. He was able to get out his front line of debate answers, and that was good enough to get him by without too much damage. In any form of debate, if you want your attacks to stick, you must stay with them for an extended period of time so you can rebut the answer of the opponent you are attacking. This did not happen last night, and is one of the weaknesses of these presidential debates. But Gingrich was far from passive, stepping up repeatedly to attack. A favorite line: ""I am a Reaganite, I'm proud to be a Reaganite. I will tell the truth even at the risk of causing some confusion, sometimes with the timid."" That's what the Republicans are looking for. They want tough conservative talk and someone who can take the fight to Obama. Gingrich behaved as though he was ready and willing to do so. And Romney missed his chance in this debate. There is only one more debate before the new year and before the voting begins in Iowa. I would suggest Romney take a serious look at changing his approach. Staying the course might feel safe, but it is no longer a winning strategy. Sometimes you risk everything when you refuse to take risks. Does Romney really want to bet the nomination on the hopes that Gingrich will implode? (He really needs to stop betting in these debates, by the way. A $10,000 bet he offered to Perry, over Perry's accusation that he'd excised one of his positions from a later edition of his book, could not have helped him in the heartland.) Debating not to lose is perhaps the riskiest thing Romney can do at this point. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.","Todd Graham: Mitt Romney had a bad debate in Iowa, didn't seem to know he's trailing in polls .

"(CNN) -- New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees threw a touchdown pass in the first quarter of Sunday night's game against the San Diego Chargers. That's not exactly news, because throwing touchdown passes is what Drew Brees does -- and does and does and does. What is news is that it was the 48th consecutive game in which Brees has thrown for a TD. The accomplishment breaks the NFL record set by Hall of Famer Johnny Unitas of the Baltimore Colts during a stretch that started in 1956 and ended in 1960, according to the league's official website. The league eased its suspension of Saints coach Sean Payton to allow Payton to be in the Superdome to witness the event. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell tweeted his regards: . ""Congrats to @drewbrees & his teammates on breaking Unitas' record,"" Goodell said. ""Amazing accomplishment by great QB & leader. We're proud of you, Drew."" Brees' streak began October 16, 2009, and who knows when it will end? According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, over those 48 games, Brees has thrown for 114 touchdowns (compared to Unitas' 102) and connected with 14 different teammates in the end zone. (Unitas had just seven targets during his streak.) The nearest active quarterback to Brees and Unitas is Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, whose current streak of touchdown-pass games stands at 37. The Green Bay Packers' Brett Favre had a 36-game streak. Brees seems to be in the business of breaking longstanding marks. Last year he shattered Dan Marino's record for most passing yards in a season with 5,476.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United moved into second spot in the English Premier League with a convincing 3-0 win at Newcastle Sunday. United have moved above local rivals Manchester City on goal difference, but both trail pacesetters Chelsea by four points after seven games. Alex Ferguson's men responded to their shock 3-2 home defeat last weekend to Tottenham Hotspur with a fine performance against north-east hopefuls Newcastle. Early goals from defenders Jonny Evans and Patrice Evra put them firmly in command before young England international Tom Cleverley wrapped up the three points with a brilliant strike after the break. It was his first English Premier League goal. Wayne Rooney, who set up the two opening goals from corners and was named man of the match, said United were delighted with their display. ""It was a great result, everyone knows this is one of the hardest games of the season and we came away and defended brilliantly,"" he told Sky Sports. Tottenham, improving fast under new manager Andre Villas-Boas, built on their success at Old Trafford with a 2-0 home win over struggling Aston Villa. Villas-Boas ended American goalkeeper Brad Freidel's run of 310 straight league games by selecting French international signing Hugo Lloris. A mistake by Lloris nearly let in Villa for the opener in the second half but shortly afterwards Steven Caulker deflected home a Jermain Defoe shot. Aaron Lennon sealed a win which lifts Tottenham to fifth, five points adrift of Chelsea, with a surging run and shot on 67 minutes. Elsewhere, Liverpool's disappointing start to the season continued as they were held goalless at Anfield by Stoke, while Southampton and Fulham drew 2-2. In Serie A, Juventus extended their unbeaten run to 47 games with a 2-1 away win at Siena. The Turin side were boosted by the news Friday that their coach Antonio Conte could return to their bench in December and the victory kept them ahead of Napoli, later 2-1 winners at home to Udinese, on goal difference. Andre Pirlo put them ahead after 14 minutes but Emanuele Calaio equalized after the break for the home side. Midfielder Claudio Marchisio volleyed a superb winner in the 85th minute for Juve. A third minute goal for Inter's Walter Samuel settled the Milan derby in the San Siro as they beat Milan 1-0. Lazio also stayed in early title contention as Miroslav Klose scord twice in a 3-0 win over Pescara. Reigning Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund lost more ground on runaway leaders Bayern Munich when they were held 1-1 at Hanover after Robert Lewandowski had given them a 26th minute lead. Second placed Eintracht Frankfurt suffered their first defeat of the season, beaten 2-0 at Borussia Moenchengladbach.","Manchester United score convincing 3-0 win at Newcastle .

"(CNN) -- Louisiana State Police investigating wiretapping allegations against the New Orleans Saints football team said Monday they found no evidence any state laws were broken. The investigation began in April after ESPN, citing anonymous sources, reported that Saints General Manager Mickey Loomis had a device in his Superdome suite that was wired to allow him to hear members of the opposing coaching staff from 2002 to 2004. ""This has been an intensive investigation, and after numerous interviews we have determined that there is no evidence that state laws have been violated,"" said State Police Superintendent Col. Mike Edmonson. He cautioned that he was not in a position to comment on the status of a federal investigation that is being conducted by the FBI. When the story first broke, Loomis vigorously denied the accusation. ""In my 29 years in the NFL, I have never listened to an opposing team's communications,"" he said. ""I have never asked for the capability to listen to an opposing team's communications. I have never inquired as to the possibility of listening in on an opposing team's communications. And I have never been aware of any capability to listen in on an opposing team's communications at the Superdome or any NFL stadium."" The allegation came on the heels of another Saints scandal. In March, the NFL penalized the Saints and members of its coaching staff for the team's bounty program. The unprecedented punishment was handed down after an investigation found that the team had an active bounty program during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. During this time, players were purportedly offered payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game.

"(CNN) -- Seven families who thought they had escaped the wrath of Irene are now stranded in the New York's Catskill Mountains after bridges crumbled all around them. The 23 people -- including two pregnant women, seven toddlers and three infants -- are now stuck with no electricity, a dwindling supply of food and were down to one gallon of water late Sunday night. ""When we heard news about (bad weather) hitting Brooklyn, we thought we had saved ourselves,"" said Irina Noveck, one of those trapped at a vacation house in Prattsville, New York. But after four bridges leading to the house collapsed, the families found themselves in a more dire predicament. ""We're sitting in one room, and it's a horrible situation and there is no way out,"" Noveck said. ""(We) called 911, 311, nobody can help. Kids are getting scared, food is getting spoiled."" She said the families brought enough food for their weeklong stay, but that week ends Monday. And well water to the house is powered by an electric pump, but now there is no electricity. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office said early Monday that emergency officials are monitoring the situation and ""expect to rescue the people by sometime Monday."" Greene County Administrator Shaun Groden said Prattsville was one of the hardest-hit areas in terms of flooding after Irene tore over New York. He said the volume of water coming off the Catskill mountaintops is estimated to have exceeded the flow from Niagara Falls on both the American and Canadian sides, based on cubic feet per minute. Earlier Sunday, 25 people stranded in Moore's Motel in Prattsville were rescued by National Guard troops and mutual aid. The effort took hours because 70 mph gusts proved too powerful for an air rescue, Groden said. A total of 87 people stranded in Prattsville were rescued Sunday, he said. Groden said Greene County is experiencing a 500-year flood, with many communities impassable. The county has missing bridges, major flooding and boats ""that look like corks in the water."" He said rain had stopped by late Sunday night. While officials hope the major runoff is over by Monday morning, high tide is expected at 6 a.m. near the Hudson River. CNN's Maria P.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two Americans and three Afghan soldiers died in a firefight that might have involved insurgent forces, the International Security Assistance Force said Sunday. One of the U.S. deaths was a soldier; the other was a civilian, U.S. officials said. The coalition first said the clash Saturday was the latest in a spate of insider attacks involving Afghan forces, which have killed more than 50 NATO troops this year. Later, the coalition called that into question. It appears the clash in Sydabad district might have been provoked by insurgent fire, said Lt. Gen. Adrian Bradshaw, the ISAF deputy commander, at a news conference. Marine killed in Afghanistan predicted insider attack that lead to his death . The firefight took place at a temporary checkpoint being operated by ISAF troops in Wardak province, west of Kabul. An Afghan National Army, or ANA unit, was nearby, Bradshaw said. ""According to ISAF and ANA reporting, after a short conversation took place between ANA and ISAF personnel, firing occurred which resulted in the fatal wounding of an ISAF soldier and the death of his civilian colleague."" Neither the statement nor Bradshaw indicated who fired the fatal rounds. Investigators from ISAF and the Afghan army were trying to establish ""whether the initial exchange of fire was provoked by insurgent firing,"" Bradshaw said. ""That is not clear,"" but ""there is a report of insurgent fire,"" he said. In its statement, ISAF called the clash ""tragic."" The incident brings the confirmed U.S. death toll inside Afghanistan to 2,002, according to a CNN account. The deaths include four U.S. civilians. The thoughts and prayers of the president and first lady ""go out to the families of those who sacrifice so much for this country in Afghanistan, including the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice,"" said Josh Earnest, a spokesman for President Barack Obama. Insider attacks by Afghan soldiers and police officers -- or militants wearing uniforms -- have been on the rise for months. ISAF: Insurgents in deadly attack in Afghanistan wore U.S. Army uniforms . So-called ""green-on-blue"" attacks have been climbing this year, triggering concerns about the stability of Afghan security forces ahead of planned NATO withdrawals in 2014. ""Green-on-blue"" refers to a color-coding system used by the military, in which blue refers to international troops and green refers to allied Afghan forces. ""Make no mistake though that these attacks do not diminish in any way the commitment of the president, the commitment of our men and women in uniform, the commitment of our allies to follow through and complete successful transition to Afghanistan by 2014,"" said Earnest. The senior combat leader in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, said he is ""mad as hell"" about the insider attacks, but he stressed it is important to remember the majority of Afghans are ""with us in this."" ""We're willing to sacrifice a lot for this campaign, but we're not willing to be murdered for it,"" he said during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that aired Sunday night. Afghan President Hamid Karzai also appeared on the show. He described the attacks as ""sad"" and spoke about the security situation.

"(CNN) -- The general manager for the New Orleans Saints said Thursday he has never listened in on an opposing team's communications, or asked to have the capability. Allegations that he had the ability to eavesdrop on coaches for nearly three seasons were not true, Mickey Loomis told reporters. ""I have a clear conscience."" ""In my 29 years in the NFL, I have never listened to an opposing team's communications,"" Loomis said. ""I have never asked for the capability to listen to an opposing team's communications. I have never inquired as to the possibility of listening in on an opposing team's communications. And I have never been aware of any capability to listen in on an opposing team's communications at the Superdome or any NFL stadium."" Louisiana State Police have joined the FBI in looking into the matter. ""All we have now are allegations of illegal use of wiretapping and eavesdropping,"" state police Superintendent Mike Edmonson said earlier this week. Loomis said he did not know who made the eavesdropping claim. ""I'm angry about it,"" he said. ESPN reported this week that the Saints general manager had a device in his Superdome suite that was wired to allow him to hear members of the opposing coaching staff from 2002 to 2004. The stadium suffered severe damage in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina ripped through the city. Citing anonymous sources, the report said it could not determine for certain whether Loomis ever used the system. On Monday, Saints spokesman Greg Bensel called the report ""1,000% false -- completely inaccurate."" ""We asked ESPN to provide us evidence to support their allegations, and they refused. The team and Mickey are seeking all legal recourse regarding these false allegations,"" he said. Jim Haslett, former Saints coach and current defensive coordinator for the Washington Redskins, similarly cast doubt on the ESPN report. ""At no time during my tenure as head coach with the New Orleans Saints did Mickey and I discuss monitoring opposing team coach's communication, nor did I have any knowledge of this. To my knowledge this concept was never discussed or utilized,"" he said in a statement. The statute of limitations for wiretapping crimes is typically five years, according to CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. When asked how that fact might figure into the investigation, Edmonson said, ""Let's find out that if the allegations are factual and if state law has been compromised first. Then it will be up to the U.S. attorney or district attorney to review the matter."" A spokesman for the National Football League said Monday that the league had no prior knowledge of the wiretapping accusations, which come on the heels of another Saints scandal. This month, the NFL upheld penalties it imposed against the Saints and members of its coaching staff for the team's bounty program. The unprecedented punishment was handed down in March after an NFL investigation found that the team had an ""active bounty program"" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. During this time, players were purportedly offered payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game. The stiffest penalty handed down -- an indefinite ban -- was given to Gregg Williams, the Saints defensive coordinator who, over the offseason, moved to take that same position with the St. Louis Rams. Head coach Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012-13 season. Loomis was suspended without pay for the season's first eight regular season games, while assistant head coach Joe Vitt was suspended without pay for the first six regular season games. The team was also fined $500,000 and ordered to forfeit its second-round draft picks in 2012 and 2013, the NFL has said. Loomis said Thursday the team respects the NFL's decision on the bounty program . ""It is our job to move forward. Player safety is a paramount issue for the league and the New Orleans Saints."" CNN's Rick Martin contributed to this report.","Mickey Loomis denies he listened in on communications, or tried to .

"(CNN) -- Ain Shams University Biologist Hebat Abdel Hadi is taking ""waste not, want not"" to a whole other level. Alphonso Van Marsh discovered first hand how damaging the Nile crayfish can be. She says crayfish carcasses the part of the crustacean that humans often throw away are for the birds. As higher chicken feed costs push multi-national chicken firms like Pilgrim's Pride and Tyson's Food to report losses this year, Abdel Hadi says crayfish waste is an alternative source for the protein and minerals necessary to raise chickens. Abdel Hadi earned her PhD exploring the use of crayfish as chicken feed. Her studies included comparing chickens fed with fish meal, with those raised on meal made with crayfish waste. ""The group of chickens [that we raised] on crayfish have stronger bones, have a higher optical density of meat. The color of the meat is better, the taste is better, it looks better,"" she says. The crayfish carcass is largely shell and skeleton. Feed nutritionists say crayfish-sourced feed would therefore contain high percentages of calcium and minerals. As a result, Abdel Hadi says, her experiments show that chickens raised on a crayfish feed diet lay more, stronger, higher-protein eggs. But poultry nutrition experts warn that chicken farming is a complex science that involves multiple nutrition and energy needs. ""The challenge has to do more with genetics, and the right balance for this fast growing bird,"" says Martin Humphries, Feed Sales Director for an English specialist poultry feed supplier. ""Crayfish heads will have some meat in there for protein. Crayfish skeletons will have calcium and I'm sure there is a nutritional value but perhaps [feeding crayfish to chickens] is a leap too far for now,"" Humphries says. Egypt is experiencing a crayfish invasion along the Nile River. Scientists like Dr. Madgy Khalil, who also works at Ain Shams University, say there are unprecedented numbers of crayfish thriving in the Nile with no natural predator, from the Mediterranean Sea or from the south of Egypt. The crayfish that have a penchant for clawing into fishermen's nets and eating their catch are causing problems for fishermen. But are there enough crayfish to sustain a chicken feed industry? Andrew Kendall, a spokesman with the UK's largest feed manufacturer BOCM Pauls is unsure. ""Theoretically, it is possible to use crayfish remains, but they would be in such short supply it would not be a feasible solution. For manufacturers who make any kind any business on a large scale, there's not enough [crayfish] supply to be a viable business. However, it could be better for a niche market,"" he says.","CNN's Alphonso Van Marsh spent time with Nile fishermen in Egypt .

"(CNN) -- Four NFL players will be eligible to play this weekend despite having been suspended for their involvement in the New Orleans Saints' controversial ""bounty"" program, the league said Friday. Their suspensions are to be reviewed by Commissioner Roger Goodell, according to the NFL. The move came shortly after a ruling by a three-member appeals panel. ""Consistent with the panel's decision, Commissioner Goodell will, as directed, make an expedited determination of the discipline imposed for violating the league's pay-for-performance/bounty rule,"" said league spokesman Greg Aiello. ""Until that determination is made, the four players are reinstated and eligible to play starting this weekend."" In March, the league suspended four current and former Saints players -- Jonathan Vilma, Scott Fujita, Anthony Hargrove and Will Smith -- concluding that they had leadership roles in the pay-for-injury program. ""I can't wait to see Jonathan on the field,"" said Vilma's attorney, Peter Ginsberg. ""He's fought long and hard for a measure of justice."" Vilma tweeted: ""Victory is mine!!!! -stewie griffin."" Stewie Griffin is the name of a child character in the animated TV show ""Family Guy"" for whom ""victory is mine"" is a catchphrase. Smith also tweeted Friday, saying, ""Thank you to everyone involved in the process of this solution. And everyone who supported us through this whole ordeal."" Fujita said he was ""overwhelmed with all the support."" ""Thank you so much everyone,"" he tweeted. ""Can't tell you how much it means to me."" The league also suspended three coaches and the Saints' general manager this year. The panel's ruling does not affect them. Vilma, a defensive captain, helped the team's defensive coordinator establish and fund the program, the league said in a news release. ""Multiple independent sources also confirmed that Vilma offered a specific bounty -- $10,000 in cash -- to any player who knocked Arizona quarterback Kurt Warner out of the 2009 Divisional Playoff Game and later pledged the same amount to anyone who knocked Minnesota quarterback Brett Favre out of the 2009 NFC Championship Game the following week,"" the league concluded after a months-long internal investigation. The NFL said its investigation found that the Saints had an ""active bounty program"" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. During this time, players were purportedly offered payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game.

"(CNN) -- The Internet was made for moments like these. Clint Eastwood and his empty chair didn't so much detract from Mitt Romney's big moment at the last night of the Republican National Convention, as much as they became breakout stars in their own right. Romney and Marco Rubio still had their moments. Clint retained his Hollywood icon status. And two new stars were born, Invisible Obama and Clint's Chair. Those weren't the only OMG moment during the final night of the RNC. 1. More crying . ""Is crying becoming a 'thing' for Republicans?"" asked @libgrrrl Thursday night. We couldn't have said it better ourselves. One of Eastwood's most tweeted moments was his reference to crying when Obama was elected. ""I just thought this is great. Everybody's crying, Oprah was crying. I was even crying,"" he said. U.S. Olympian Mike Eruzione got choked up speaking about carrying the World Trade Center flag during the 2002 Opening Ceremony, but it was Romney talking about single rose his father would leave by his mother's bedside every day that had most eyes welling up, including Romney's. ""Mitt's tearing up talking about his parents! Y'all I can't even deal with all this crying tonight,"" tweeted @rsethib . And then there were the weepers in the audience, some of whom managed to hold back tears long enough to tweet, like @ShoshanaWeissmann, ""Loving this!!!!!! Crying a little and SO inspired!!!!!!"" 2. Homocon . CNN reporter Jen Christensen spent time with members of the Log Cabin Republicans who were invited to participate in the convention platform for the first time this year. The LGBT group GOProud threw a Tuesday night party called ""Homocon,"" that included go-go dancers and a velvet rope. However inclusion did not = acceptance. But let's focus on the lighter moments shall we? ""Dance remix of 'say a little prayer' plays at #homocon and still no one dancing. I'm sorry, but are these Republicans really gay?? #gop2012,"" wrote @libawr . ""Weirdest events for #RNC2012? Try zombies, Homocon and comedian (?) Grover Norquist,"" wrote @Danielson_Times . 3. Take a seat. Almost any seat. When comedian Patton Oswalt tweeted, "" 'If Clint Eastwood ever talks to a chair on national TV, people will need a way to reassure each other' -- inventor of Twitter, March 2006,"" not everyone was amused. Thankfully we were. In true Twitter fashion, the social community soon asked why Eastwood should be having all the fun and decided to turn the spotlight back on themselves by snapping photos of their own empty chairs and tagging them #eastwooding. More than 500 tagged photos were uploaded to Instagram with many more shared on Twitter. Cats, dogs and babies were of course, included, as the Internet gets extremely anxious whenever they stray too far from cats, dogs or babies. Mia Farrow almost got in on the joke, neglecting to post a photo when she tweeted, ""Breakfast w #emptychair. We were a little rude to invisible guest #eastwooding."" The fun extended all the way to Pinterest as Invisible_Obama posted, ""At last a worthy opponent,"" with a pin of Romney and an empty wooden chair. Piers Morgan summed it all up with this tweet, ""Awk-ward. #Clint"" The Twitter account @ClintsChair has more than 2,000 followers and continued tweeting through the night, taking responsibility at one point for Eastwood's ramblings. ""I was talking to Clint about Afghanistan right before we went out there. That's why I forgot his notes."" And it wasn't too long before @BarackObama responded with ""This seat's taken,"" showing Obama comfortably seated in a leather chair clearly labeled ""The President."" (As a side note, ""The Empty Chair"" Facebook page is a community focused on supporting and comforting survivors of grief. They continue on as usual, seemingly unaffected by the empty chair meme.) 4. America. America. America. How many times did Romney say ""America?"" The great folks at @Upworthy counted 95. But they might have missed a few since they made a drinking game out of it. @Upworthy, ""If you are still playing the #AmericaCount drinking game, MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL. #GOP2012"" 5. This guy . Several photos of a man wearing what appeared to be a cowboy hat made of a Yuengling beer case earned salutes, praise and a few questions. We say: Well played, sir. ""ok yeah this guy made a cowboy hat out of a case of Yuengling and went to the #rnc,"" tweeted @trimpey who posted a photo for our benefit. 6. WTH? It's no surprise Eastwood's conversation with an empty chair raised a lot of eyebrows. Anyone having an unscripted conversation with an empty chair during a live broadcast on every major network would. It is Clint Eastwood, after all. What the Internet seemed most delighted by was that no one could decipher what Eastwood was actually saying. Transcripts revealed a text riddled with incomplete sentences. The best ""summary"" was posted on Comedy Central's Indecision Tumblr and goes like this, ""I was talking to Barack Obama the other day... Potato. Sneaker. Fish. Pizza. Algebra. Racecar."" On Twitter, the accounts @InvisibleObama and @ClintsChair rocketed to instant popular kid status tweeting things like, ""Sigh...agent just got off the phone with Biden. Booked for Charlotte."" (@ClintsChair) The Facebook page Invisible Obama (one of three) began posting photos of, wait for it, Invisible Obama doing things POTUS would. But they didn't have all the fun. ""After Clint Eastwood's chair, Romney is back stage feverishly making a sock puppet,"" wrote @rationalists . Oh, if only it were true.

"(CNN) -- Some analysts have attributed the recent downing of a U.S. RQ-170 Sentinel high-altitude reconnaissance drone in Iran to that nation's increasingly sophisticated capability to launch cyber attacks. Others have dismissed the idea that Iran was capable of bringing down an RQ-170, arguing that Iranian air defenses do not have the capability to track an aircraft with radar-evading technology. Either way, the incident clearly demonstrates American concerns regarding Iran's nuclear capacity, as the drone was likely sent over Iranian territory to spy on its nuclear program. I find the argument that Iran is engaged in developing a nuclear weapons program credible. I am also convinced that Iran will not test a device, but rather will acquire the capability to produce a weapon quickly if its strategic environment deteriorates to such an extent that it feels it must. I am further convinced that an Israeli or American strike or strikes against its nuclear facilities would put Iran's nuclear program back by a few years but would not be able to terminate it. In fact, such strikes would provide Tehran with the legitimacy to go ahead and acquire nuclear weapons capability in full view of the world and with international sympathy. It is time for world leaders to recognize the inevitability of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons capability, even if it remains untested, with Tehran following the policy and adopting the rhetoric of deliberate ambiguity. Moreover, the major powers that act as the self-appointed guardians of the current international nuclear order need to recognize that treaties and other legal documents are not the primary determinants when it comes to state decisions regarding acquisition of nuclear capability. It is a country's strategic environment that principally determines such a decision. Iran's strategic environment is such that it makes the decision by Iran's policy makers to acquire nuclear weapons appear rational both to themselves and to the wider Iranian public. This is why leading opposition figures are as opposed to suspending uranium enrichment as regime hard-liners. The foremost opposition presidential candidate, Mir-Hossein Moussavi, in an interview with the Financial Times in the run-up to the elections in 2009, stated categorically: ""No one in Iran would accept suspension."" The strategic rationality of such a policy was recognized in a candid moment by none other than Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak. In an appearance on ""Charlie Rose"" last month, Barak was asked whether he would want to acquire nuclear weapons if he were an Iranian government minister. Barak responded very candidly: ""Probably, probably. I know it's not -- I mean I don't delude myself that they are doing it just because of Israel. They look around, they see the Indians are nuclear, the Chinese are nuclear, Pakistan is nuclear, not to mention the Russians."" While downplaying the Israeli nuclear weapons capability, Barak neglected to mention that Iran's policy makers perceive the American nuclear and non-nuclear armada in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea as the greatest threat to their security. All this obviously makes for a dangerous strategic environment as far as Tehran is concerned, regardless of the nature of the Iranian regime. The American decision to invade non-nuclear Iraq while desisting from militarily confronting a nuclear North Korea surely tells Iran's rulers that even rudimentary nuclear capability can deter potential American and allied designs to attack Iran, whether to topple its regime or impair its nuclear capacity. Given the near-certainty that Iran is launched on an irreversible course for nuclear weapons capacity, there are only two strategies that can be used -- if not to stop the nuclear program, then at least to make it less threatening to American interests. The first is for the United States to actively promote the idea of a nuclear weapon-free zone (NWFZ) for the Middle East that would include both Israel and Iran. Iran has supported calls for a NWFZ for several years, most recently at a Nuclear Disarmament Conference it hosted in April 2010, as long as it included Israel as well as Iran. However, promoting a NWFZ in the Middle East does not appear realistic for the United States in the short run because Israel is stubbornly opposed to it before a permanent solution is found to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Furthermore, domestic constraints, including a highly pro-Israel Congress, would not allow the U.S. administration to seriously pursue this course. The other option is to accept Iran's status as a near-nuclear power and engage it in substantive discussions about the future architecture of regional security in the broader Middle East, and more specifically in the Persian Gulf, where Iran is the indispensable power. This would entail a drastic revision of the current American strategy of isolating and quarantining Iran, and replacing it with one that accommodates Iran's regional aspirations and attempts to find areas of convergence rather than confrontation with Tehran. The American approach to India in the 1990s and the 2000s could form the model for such a policy. Such a change of course is likely to pose a major but not insuperable challenge to American policy makers, given the current atmosphere of mutual hostility surrounding Washington's relations with Tehran. It would require creative diplomacy on the part of the White House and the State Department, including signaling Iran that the United States recognizes its pre-eminent status in the Persian Gulf region (much as Washington did with India in South Asia) and the legitimate role that goes with it. It will also mean reducing the paranoia currently afflicting Iran's policy makers because of their fear of encirclement by nuclear powers. If this means that the international community has to learn to live with a near-nuclear Iran, then this is the price it must be willing to pay for stability and security in this crucial region. As recent experience has demonstrated, economic sanctions and military threats are only likely to stiffen the Iranian resolve to acquire nuclear weapons as well as to act as the ""spoiler"" not only in the energy-rich Persian Gulf but also in the strategically important broader Middle East region. Furthermore, American hostility toward Iran reinforces the domestic legitimacy of the Iranian regime and discredits the democratic opposition, an outcome that is not in the long-term interest of the United States. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Mohammed Ayoob.","Mohammed Ayoob: Iran inevitably will acquire nuclear weapons capability .

"(CNN) -- ""Out of an abundance of caution,"" American Airlines said Tuesday it would inspect 47 Boeing 757 airplanes after seats on two of the company's jetliners came loose. A Boeing 757 from Boston to Miami carrying 175 passengers diverted to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday when three seats in row 12 came loose shortly after takeoff. A second American Boeing 757 returned to JFK on Monday morning after a similar seat issue was discovered. ""Originally, American planned to evaluate the seats on eight Boeing 757 airplanes, but out of an abundance of caution, the decision was made to proactively evaluate a total of 47 Boeing 757 airplanes that have the same model Main Cabin seats with a common locking mechanism,"" company spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said in a statement. ""American's internal investigation has focused on one of three types of Main Cabin seats on the 757s and how the rows of these three seats fit into the track that is used to secure the rows to the floor of the airplanes. Our maintenance and engineering teams have discovered that the root cause is a saddle clamp improperly installed on the foot of the row leg,"" she said. The clamps were used on 47 of the company's 102 Boeing 757 airplanes. So far, American Airlines has inspected 36 planes and found that six -- including the two involved in the recent diversions -- had seats that were not properly secured. Not all of the seats were loose, the company said, but they had the potential to become so. Eleven aircraft still need to be inspected. Huguely said the seats issue does not appear to be connected to any one work group or maintenance facility, and apologized for any inconvenience to customers. ""Safety is -- and always will be -- American's top concern,"" the spokeswoman said. The Federal Aviation Administration is looking into the incidents of loose seats, which are the latest in a string of woes for American Airlines. Earlier Tuesday, an American Airlines flight from Chicago to London made an unscheduled landing at Shannon Airport in Ireland after a passenger reported a smoky odor, an airline spokesman said. American Airlines Flight 98, a Boeing 777-200 carrying 246 passengers and 14 crew members, was diverted as a precaution, airline spokesman Ian Bradley told CNN. An inspection revealed that the odor was coming from an overhead fan that had overheated, he said. Niall Maloney, head of operations for Shannon Airport, said such technical diversions are not uncommon. Who wants to fly American Airlines? The airline has also been beset recently by labor troubles, delays and flight cancellations. American, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year, persuaded a judge to throw out its contract with the pilots union last month. Since then, the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket. More than 1,000 American flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed in the past month alone. Airline management has blamed the situation on pilots filing what it claims are frivolous reports about aircraft problems. The pilots union has denied management's assertion. Late Tuesday, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association said it would resume contract negotiations with the airline. Tom Hoban said talks could start as early as Wednesday. A company spokesman similarly said that negotiations are set to resume this week. Meanwhile, Robert Gless, deputy director of the Air Transport Division of the Transport Workers Union of America, dismissed the notion that the problems with loose seats were linked to labor issues as ""without any basis in fact."" Seat installation work is largely carried out by outside contractors, rather than maintenance personnel employed by the airline, he said in a statement. ""Problems related to seats are less likely a labor problem, but rather a management issue related to outsourcing work to third-party facilities,"" he said. American Airlines plans to increase its use of outside maintenance facilities, including in China and other overseas locations, as it seeks to exit bankruptcy, he added. Seats come loose on two American Airlines flights . CNN's Stephanie Halasz, Saskya Vandoorne, Sherri Maksin, Nick Valencia and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Contract negotiations between the company, pilots are expected to resume this week .

"New York (CNN) -- A lawyer for a woman accused of being a high-end New York madam said Monday his client ""doesn't have two nickels to rub together,"" and offered his own loft as bail so the mother of four could get out of jail. Judge Juan Merchan will weigh the proposal made by the attorney, Peter Gleason, which would mandate that Anna Gristina be confined to Gleason's apartment and have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet. A hearing is set for Thursday to consider this offer, which prosecutors oppose. For now, Gristina, 44, remains behind bars with her bail set at $2 million bond or $1 million cash. She was arrested on February 22 and has been charged with promoting prostitution in the third degree. She is suspected of running a multimillion-dollar escort service for high-powered clientele out of an apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side. The judge ruled Monday that, given her financial situation as portrayed by Gleason, Gristina can continue to have a public defender. That means public funds can be used to pay her court-appointed attorney, Richard Siracusa. Gleason, who is a friend of Gristina's, is representing her pro bono, or free of charge. Merchan, the judge, denied Gristina's request to replace Siracusa as one of her representatives. He and Gleason butted heads during Monday's court hearing. Gleason complained that Siracusa had not visited Gristina at New York's well-known Rikers Island jail complex, while Gleason countered that he'd visited their mutual client ""seven or eight times."" Siracusa, meanwhile, accused Gleason of hindering his own efforts. The judge made it clear Monday that Siracusa will be Gristina's public defender and criminal attorney, while Gleason would represent her in other matters. Last Tuesday, a New York judge denied a request to reduce Gristina's bail. That same day, a Morgan Stanley broker was placed on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation into Gristina, according to company spokesman Mark Lake. Prosecutors say Gristina was with the broker in his Manhattan office shortly before her arrest. They say the two were there to discuss the creation of a website that arranges illicit encounters. The broker, whom CNN is not naming because he has not been charged with a crime, said they were in talks to create a website for a legitimate dating service.","A lawyer offers his NYC loft in lieu of a $2 million bail so Anna Gristina can get out of jail .

"New York (CNN) -- Jazz master Wynton Marsalis says the blues is the true American music -- the heartbeat and unifying principle of jazz, country, R&B, gospel and other styles -- but it's been relegated to the back of the bus by greed and the legacy of racism. Marsalis grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana, son of Dolores and Ellis Marsalis. He was a trumpet prodigy, surrounded by top-notch musicians and steeped in the city's eclectic music. He was encouraged to excel by his father, a jazz pianist who instilled in his son a love of musical excellence and integrity. Marsalis plays classical and jazz music with equal mastery. He is artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center  and has won nine Grammy Awards and the Pulitzer Prize in music. He will be awarded the French Legion of Honor on November 6. In an interview Tuesday, Marsalis talked to CNN.com about the primary position of the blues in American music. The blues is our root music, American born-and-bred, but it's been treated like a stepchild of dubious origin, granted only secondary status, in Marsalis' view. It suffuses Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, rock 'n' roll, country-western, gospel, bluegrass and more, but never got its financial due or the respect it deserves. Marsalis says that's because of racism -- it was the music of a whole people granted only secondary status -- and its inability to make a lot of money. He also talks about his father, how slavery has affected the nation, and some lessons to be learned from jazz. CNN: You have a DVD out called ""Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis Play the Music of Ray Charles."" That's jazz, country and R&B. What do those styles have in common? WYNTON MARSALIS: The blues. It runs through all American music. Somebody bending the note. The other is the two-beat groove. It's in New Orleans music, it's in jazz, it's in country music, it's in gospel. The other is the down-home sensibility that's sophisticated. That's why Louis Armstrong could play with Jimmy Rogers. Ray Charles is actually the embodiment. He and Willie Nelson came 'round in young manhood at a time in the late '40s early 1950s when all of the American music, root music, was all combined. It became segregated in the mid- to late-'50s. Carl Perkins had a hit in 1955 -- ""Blue Suede Shoes."" It was on the R&B charts, it was on the country charts, it was No. 1 on the rock and roll charts. [It was] basically the same music, so there was an intersection point. It's like in cuisine, that would be like fried chicken and red beans and rice, it would be like potato salad and barbecued ribs. Someone in Texas not going to eat barbecued ribs? CNN: What led to the compartmentalization of these kinds of music, that came from the same roots? MARSALIS: Money and racism. I don't know which one came first. CNN: Why was blues not regarded as something of value in this country? MARSALIS: It came from who we didn't like. That's what it was -- it wasn't that we couldn't see it. Who it came from, we did not like them. CNN: So do you include African-Americans in that? So black people didn't appreciate it? MARSALIS: They didn't appreciate it. They don't now. That's part of the whole kind of self-hatred that comes from that type of slavery that the black American still labors under. That racism was heavy. The legacy of it -- it wasn't just 50 years. It was seven generations, and if a generation is 33 years, ... seven or eight [generations]. That's a long time. And to recover from it has proven to be very difficult. CNN: So is that what's going on with rap? MARSALIS: No question. Rap is the repetition of the minstrel show. But it's not going to go away, it was too many people. If it had been 100,000 people, it can go away. ... But it can't be millions of people and their descendants. [Slavery] was a very powerful and successful system. And it went on for a long time. In the aftermath of slavery ... there was a retrenching, and [it turned into] the type of racism that was experienced by people who came to the North. That consciousness has begun to shift, in the last 30 years. And that's 20 or 30 years of just thawing and shifting that's attached to 330 years [of slavery], and the thought you can get up and you will be better ... that's just asinine, it's absurd. CNN: But didn't the blues come from this, being marginalized? MARSALIS: The blues was like a solution to that, an antidote to it. But the blues is not only Afro-American music. CNN: So, you've written that it's not just African, it's American. What about America gave rise to the blues? MARSALIS: It is America. It's that combination, those tensions, the east-west tensions, the kind of tension of being a slave in the land of freedom, and the land of freedom itself, the Western mind, the concept of soloing across time, the call-and-response of democracy, direct call and response, the kind of optimism that is American in nature, is in the blues. There are elements in it that are African and there are elements of the American take on Europeanism. It's integrated, it's like a person whose DNA is integrated. You start to try to figure it out -- but you can't. That's how the blues is, that's why it fits with everything, country-western, bluegrass -- everybody's playing the same music. CNN: You write that jazz leaves room for individual creativity, but you have to listen and allow the other musicians to participate equally. So what's the lesson for the nation? MARSALIS: We have to have an overall cultural objective, which we don't have. ... We then fight under the flag of a position, the left or the right, black or white, old or young. It's very simplistic. We don't know our cultural history, we don't know we are together, and because we don't know we are together we can't act in that way. And that's the main thing our music, and the history of our music, can teach us as a nation. The one concept that has to be at the heart of the American experiment is integrity. The integrity of the process is very important. If you come up on the bandstand you have to be at least trying to swing. If you don't really want to swing or play with the musicians, there's nothing they can do, because you have the freedom to destroy it. CNN: Your father set an example. It sounds like you got a lot of your ideas about integrity from him. MARSALIS: Yes, he sure did. From him. He wasn't segregated about any music, he didn't care, you could play pop music, funk, he'd say ""right, great man."" He was a jazz musician. He wasn't uptight and always railing about somebody. What he did was very clear, and what he thought about being a man, he didn't look at a boy like that. I remember he sat in with our funk band one time. ... We'd go to his gig, there'd be six people. We'd go to our gig, there'd be thousands of people, dancing having a good time. We were playing a dance at a high school, he didn't know any of the music, but he played all of the music we had. We were laughing, we said, my daddy didn't know any of the music and he didn't know any of the tunes but he was playing better than us. CNN: When you were playing in a funk band in high school, did you look at your jazz musician dad as old school? MARSALIS: No, no, never, I never suffered from that misconception, because he was so much hipper than the people I was around. Philosophically, he knew more than we did. I'd bring people to see him. He never tried to act like a child, like a kid. I never thought I knew more than him, he was on the case. CNN: What are the components of jazz? MARSALIS: The main three components are the blues, improvisation -- which is some kind of element that people are trying to make it up -- and swing, which means even though they're making up music, they're trying to make it up together. It feels great, like you're having a great conversation with somebody. Sometimes you get in a good coordinated groove, and it just continues to happen.

"(CNN) -- Adam Greenberg struck out on three pitches Tuesday night, but you couldn't tell that from his smile in the Miami Marlins' dugout. He had waited seven years for this chance. Greenberg, 31, was hit in the head by a pitch in his first and only Major League Baseball plate appearance, with the Chicago Cubs, in 2005 and had not played in the majors since. Greenberg signed a one-day contract with the Marlins on Tuesday afternoon in anticipation of taking a single at-bat in the night's game against the New York Mets. Mets knuckleballer R.A. Dickey fanned Greenberg to lead off the bottom of the sixth inning. Greenberg was pinch-hitting for Marlins left fielder Bryan Petersen at the top of the order. The Marlins Stadium public address system played Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" as Greenberg, wearing No. 10, walked up to the plate and took his place in the left-hand batter's box. He took a strike from Dickey, swung at and missed the second pitch and then waved at a pitch around his chin for the third strike. The crowd cheered loudly for him as he returned to the dugout, where his one-day-only teammates congratulated him and slapped the beaming ballplayer on the back. Greenberg had petitioned the Cubs to let him come back for one official at-bat with them, but team officials turned him down. The Marlins agreed last week to help Greenberg make his dream come true. Marlins manager Ozzie Guillen said he planned to use him as a pinch-hitter in the middle of Tuesday night's game, perhaps in the pitcher's spot in the lineup, according to MLB.com. But pitcher Jacob Turner was pitching so well that Guillen wouldn't take him out for Greenberg. Follow late-breaking updates on This Just In . ""I'm ready to help the team,"" Greenberg said in a tweet on the Marlins' account. ""The Marlins are an amazing organization. ... I couldn't be more thankful."" The pitch that knocked him out may have derailed a longer MLB career. On July 9, 2005, Greenberg stepped up to the plate to pinch-hit for the Cubs, who had just called him up from the minors, at Miami's Dolphins Stadium. Valerio de los Santos' pitch hit Greenberg in the head and sent him to the ground. Greenberg, in severe pain, had to leave the game without playing defense and no official at-bat -- it counts only as a plate appearance. As Chicago Magazine and ESPN's ""Outside the Lines"" have documented, Greenberg was dizzy for months, had blurred vision, and had trouble playing when he returned to the minors weeks after the incident. He eventually was diagnosed with positional vertigo. Symptoms eventually improved, but he struggled in the minors. He last played professionally in 2011 for the Atlantic League's Bridgeport Bluefish in his home state, Connecticut, where he runs his LuRong Living business. ESPN kept Greenberg's story alive with a couple ""OTL"" segments. And this year, filmmaker Matt Liston made it his mission to get him a real MLB at-bat. Liston, a Cubs fan and Chicago native living in California, took up Greenberg's cause this year after he and his wife saw ""Field of Dreams"" -- a baseball movie that mentions Moonlight Graham, who never came to bat in his only big-league game in 1905. ""My wife said she felt sorry for him. I said, 'Moonlight Graham has (nothing) on Adam Greenberg,'"" Liston said. ""Graham played a couple innings. Adam only got a couple seconds."" Liston, who didn't know Greenberg but recalled seeing the plate appearance on TV, decided he wanted to help him get a proper MLB at-bat. So, armed with credentials, he made the 2007 film ""Chasing October"" about the 2003 Cubs, he visited baseball training camps, trying to persuade players and general managers that Greenberg deserved a shot. He and a dozen or so friends organized the ""One At Bat"" campaign, taking to Twitter and Facebook to rally public support. They also started a Change.org petition, it had more than 25,000 supporters as of Thursday, that Liston hoped would persuade the Cubs' management to bring him back for a game this month. Liston, who met with the Cubs in May, also contacted Greenberg and ended up befriending him as he kept him updated. But the Cubs announced this month that they weren't on board. ""Adam made the big leagues based on merit in 2005,"" Cubs General Manager Jed Hoyer told the Chicago Tribune in an e-mail. ""While it is unfortunate he got hit in his first at-bat, he is in the Baseball Encyclopedia as a major leaguer and should be incredibly proud of that. We wish him the best, but there are no plans to add him to the roster now or in the future."" So Liston pressed other teams, eventually meeting in New York with the Miami Marlins General Manager David Sampson. There, Sampson told Liston that the Marlins would do it.","NEW: Greenberg makes first MLB plate appearence since 2005 injury .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani police say a Muslim cleric planted evidence to link a Christian girl to blasphemy -- a new twist in a case that has fanned flames of religious tension in the country and attracted worldwide interest. The imam, Khalid Jadoon Chishti, will himself face blasphemy charges for tearing pages out of a Quran to use as evidence against the girl, Islambad police chief Bin Yamin said. The latest development may make it easier for the girl, 14-year-old Rimsha, to be released on bail at her next court hearing. Police arrested Rimsha last month after a neighbor accused her of burning pages containing texts from the Muslim holy book, the Quran. Rimsha had two shopping bags with her: one containing ashes and the other, the partially burned pages, police said. She had gathered the paper as fuel for cooking, authorities said. Even though Rimsha's lawyer said no one actually saw the girl burning the papers, the neighbor went to Chishti -- the neighborhood cleric -- with the bags for safekeeping as evidence. Chishti wasn't certain that simply burning pages with texts from the Quran would be enough to convict Rimsha on blasphemy charges, said Munir Jaffery, the investigating officer in the case. So, the imam added two pages from the holy book itself to the bag to bolster the case, Jaffery said. Police arrested Chishti on Saturday after three witnesses told a judge about the imam's actions. He was sent to jail for 14 days, accused of evidence tampering. Chishti has denied the allegation, authorities said. Yamin, the police chief, drew a distinction between the accusations against the two, saying Rimsha is a simple-minded minor, while the imam is highly educated in religious studies and indulged in the act of blasphemy willfully.Â Â . Insulting Islam provokes widespread and immediate reaction in Pakistan, a predominantly Muslim nation. Its controversial blasphemy law makes the crime punishable by death. Critics have said the legislation is being used to entrap minorities. Punjab Gov. Salman Taseer, who criticized the law, was shot to death by his security guard last year. A Pakistani court then suspended the guard's death sentence. In Rimsha's case, about 150 people gathered on August 17 -- the day she was arrested -- in the area where the neighborhood's Christian population lives and threatened to burn down their houses, police said. Her relatives have gone into hiding. During a tense hearing Saturday, Muslim lawyers demanding that Rimsha remain in jail got into a shouting match with the judge. They provided a list of reasons the girl should be detained, including questioning whether the girl gave her lawyer the power of attorney. A judge ordered investigators to get more details on her power of attorney and postponed the hearing to Monday. Before Saturday, a decision was supposed to come Thursday, but was deferred so authorities could answer questions about her medical history. ""All these are the delaying tactics by the lawyers of the complainant to keep the girl in jail,"" said her lawyer, Tahir Naveed Choudhry. Her lawyers dashed into a car and sped off after the hearing Saturday for safety reasons. Rimsha did not attend. Pakistani authorities have come under pressure to guarantee Rimsha's safety amid concerns that if she is released on bail, angry Muslims will seek retaliation. Choudhry has sought bail, saying she is legally a minor and should be reunited with her parents rather than kept in a jail with adults. He cited a report by an independent medical board stating that the girl is 14. The doctors who examined her also concluded that her mental age was lower than her chronological age and she suffers from Down syndrome, he said. Police have said the girl is illiterate and denied knowing there were Quran verses on the documents she allegedly burned. Choudhry says he expects the trial to last as long as two years. Rimsha would remain in custody for its duration if bail is denied, he said. If she is tried as a minor, she might receive a milder sentence if convicted. As an adult, she faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for blasphemy, the lawyer said. The imam's arrest may prompt a reexamination of the allegations against the girl, authorities said Sunday. ""We have strong evidence against (the cleric),"" said Naveed Chaudhry, an adviser to Pakistan's president. ""(Rimshi's) lawyer is going to court for bail. She might be released by Monday based on this evidence.""","NEW: The imam involved in the case is himself accused of descrating a Quran .

Filipino pedestrians in Quezon City, a suburb of Manila, brave Tropical Storm Ketsana's floodwaters. Flood spawned by the rainfall killed at least 75 people with at least 21 others missing, the government said. More than 80 percent of the capital was under water that swallowed whole houses and buses. Manila, in the island of Luzon, and the nearby province of Rizal bore the brunt of the storm. People huddled on rooftops Sunday waiting on army helicopters to pluck them to safety. Others used ropes to wade through waist-deep muddy waters. Power and water supply failed in some areas.

"(NEW YORK) CNN -- After raising a staggering amount of money for the general election, President-elect Barack Obama must now rake in more cash for his transition and inauguration. Barack Obama broke fundraising records in the general election. There is about $9.74 million of taxpayer funds available to pay for the transition, but experts say that's not enough. To make up the difference, past presidents have turned to private money and corporate cash. Obama's transition team, however, is taking pains to keep lobbyists out of his transition and forgo corporate cash. John Podesta, the co-chair of Obama's transition team, has vowed to make this ""the most open and transparent transition in history,"" but Obama has not explicitly outlined his intentions for the inauguration. The Obama team will have to balance how to raise enough money without contradicting its tough talk against lobbyists. ""I really do hope Obama sticks by his principles and does not accept corporate money, does not accept money from lobbyists, and places a very, very low ceiling on the amount of money he'd accept from individuals to pay for his inauguration,"" said Craig Holman, a legislative representative for Public Citizen. Public Citizen is a national nonprofit organization that says it advocates for consumer interests in Congress and openness and democratic accountability in government. The group says companies sometimes contribute cash to the inauguration in order to buy influence.  Watch what people will do for inauguration tickets » . President Bush raised a record $42.8 million for his second inauguration, and according to Public Citizen, more than 90 percent of donations to his second inauguration were from executives or corporations. Bush limited corporate donations to $250,000 each in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interests. Obama could decide to accept corporate donations for the inauguration, but impose tighter limits. ""I think past presidents have had to raise lots of private money to do these things. And I think he's actually got a good resource base of donors that are willing and probably will give money for both the transition effort, but also the inaugural campaign as well,"" said David Lewis, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University and author of ""The Politics of Presidential Appointments."" Even without corporate cash, the Obama fundraising machine has been a force. Nearly half of the record $639 million that the Obama campaign raised during the primaries and general election came in the form of donations of $200 or less. As of mid-October, the Obama campaign had spent about $594 million, but any money left over from the general election cannot go toward the transition. The president-elect could return that money to contributors, donate it to charity, form a political action committee or contribute to other candidates, PACs or party committees, as long as he stays within federal contribution limits. Obama could also hold on to the money and use it for a future federal campaign, such as a re-election bid. The public will get a better idea of exactly how much cash is on hand when the next reports are filed with the Federal Election Commission on December 4.","Barack Obama's transition team has taken pains to keep lobbyists out of transition .

"(CNN) -- Iran is in possession of the building blocks to construct a promising, fast growing, developing economy. The basics are all there -- a sizable population of 78 million people, with a median age of just 27. A highly cultured and educated society, and by its own geological surveys the country is blessed with 9% of the world's oil reserves. Utilizing a conservative IMF calculation of $75 a barrel, that means Iran sits on $10 trillion of oil reserves and another $3.5 trillion of gas reserves. Iran, minus the intense sanctions put forward by the West starting in mid-2010, would warrant a slot in the N-11 group of countries -- this is the next wave of the most promising economies within the emerging market sphere of Jim O'Neill at Goldman Sachs. That is the promise, but the reality today with its devalued rial is the polar opposite. According to economist Steve Hanke, Professor of Applied Economics, at Johns Hopkins University, the Republic is the first country in the Middle East to ever have hyperinflation -- defined as an economy seeing its monthly inflation rate soar 50% or more each month. Iran joins Zimbabwe (2008) and North Korea (2009-2011) as the only three in the 21st Century to experience that fate and at the same time share a common link of being subject to international sanctions. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in his United Nations address toned down the rhetoric from the recent past and suggested the post-war institutions are not benefiting all citizens. ""There is no doubt that the world is in need of a new order and a fresh way of thinking,"" he said in his eighth and final address to the General Assembly as President. But that call for a new global order may ring hollow with those struggling on the ground. With daily insights from our reporter Shirzad Bozorgmehr in Tehran, we know that the costs of staples in society are soaring. Chicken prices have risen three-fold in the past year, barbari bread a five fold increase. This is directly linked to its currency. When U.S. President Barrack Obama signed the sanctions legislation into law in July 2010, the rial was trading at just over 10,000 to the dollar. It is recovering from a low last week of 37,500 on the black market, but at 28,500 the currency is still down nearly 70% in the last year. In 2010, Iran began removing subsidies for fuel, from heating oil to engine petrol, which amounted to $4,000 per year for the average family of four according to the IMF. This was a sign Iran was starting to normalize its economy and at the same time began introducing a privatization program to reduce the size of the state. That effort, economists say, stalled since it clashed with Iran's isolation from the global economy due to its pursuit of its nuclear development plan. It has been a toxic result for the average Iranian who is caught in the middle of a ""cat and mouse"" game of uranium enrichment and negotiations with the Vienna based agency, the IAEA. All the while, the screws linked to sanctions are being tightened. Oil makes up 90% of the country's export earnings, but their customers have trimmed back volumes due to the sanctions and difficulty getting systems insured. China, South Korea, Japan and India are big customers. Beijing, energy consultants say, is using the plight of sanctions to reduce the price they pay. Iran's daily production, according to OPEC, is the lowest in over two decades. It is down nearly a million barrels a day in the last five years. The sanctions also limit any new investment by the international oil giants who are already operating in Iran. So the sanctions of today will leave a terrible aftertaste for years to come. With rising import prices due to a plummeting currency, Iran Inc. is also no longer able to compete. There are reports that the industrial sector has laid off up to 800,000 workers this year and those who have kept their jobs are seeing their wages eroded by skyrocketing prices. Tehran bazaar reopens after currency protests . This is a critical window for Iranians. President Ahmadinejad's term expires in June of next year. Most candidates, whether moderate or not, are keeping their heads down during this flashpoint of anger being expressed on the streets linked to the falling rial. Meanwhile, Iranians must be asking the question: What if we joined the global economic community, even with its imperfections after the 2008 debt crisis? At this juncture it is far too early to answer that question, but most would likely say Iran's isolation to date has not been the answer to their financial woes.","Iran is in possession of the building blocks to construct a promising, fast growing economy .

"(CNN) -- American Airlines has come up with a new explanation for The Mystery of The Falling Down Seats in some of its Boeing 757 airliners. Part of the explanation is -- well -- kind of out there. The answer? Soda pop. Coffee. Snacks. Really. Something called the seat lock plunger mechanism can ""get gunked up over time with people spilling sodas, popcorn, coffee or whatever and that can affect that locking mechanism on the ground that locks the seat to the floor,"" airline spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan said Friday. 11 witty and sage airline 'gunk' retorts . Apparently, worn locking pins can get stuck when food and beverages spill onto them, allowing seat rows to come unhinged, she said. American earlier said saddle-shaped clamps installed to hold the seats down were put in backwards. While the clamps may have played a role, the soda and snack gunk now seems to be among the culprits, Fagan said. And while that explains what happened to the three American flights that experienced loose seats, it doesn't explain why the problem has affected only American flights in recent days, or why it's happened so many times in such a short period. How would you save American? ""My question is, why haven't we seen this before?"" said Bill Waldock, professor and crash lab director at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Prescott, Arizona, campus. ""Did the gunk start building up and decide to falter in the planes at the same time? I kind of doubt that honestly."" Waldock called the airline's explanation ""curious,"" adding that it ""seemed to be unique to the 757, and to the ones that they reconfigured."" ""What would make more sense is if (the seats) were improperly installed,"" he said. Besides presumably cleaning out the gunk, Fagan says American mechanics are ""taking extra steps to ensure that the seats do not dislodge from the track."" That includes installing industrial-strength metal ties as a backup, airline spokeswoman Courtney Wallace said. Later Friday afternoon, airline spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said that the company plans to have ""all 48 of our Boeing 757s back in service"" by Saturday, noting that 42 of its airplanes had already been repaired and that there were will be no disruptions to service. ""We have identified the issue, and our maintenance teams are securing an FAA-approved locking mechanism to ensure no seat can be dislodged,"" she said. American insists after these newly installed mechanical ties are in place, no more seats will be dislodged. American Airlines fixing seats in 48 757s . The problem first surfaced on a September 26 flight from Vail, Colorado, to Dallas, according to the airline. On Saturday, three seats came loose shortly after takeoff on a flight from Boston to Miami that was carrying 175 passengers. That plane diverted to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. After incidents with airline seats, readers let loose . Another incident occurred Monday on a flight from New York to Miami with 154 passengers. It returned to JFK without further incident. While rare, such incidents are not unprecedented. In 2008, according to media accounts, a United Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing when a row of seats came loose on takeoff. The National Transportation Safety Board -- which investigates U.S. civilian aircraft accidents -- does not track loose-seat incidents, spokesman Peter Knudson said. When asked about gunked seat-track fittings, a Delta spokesman said, ""We are not seeing what our competitor has described on the same scale by any means."" The coffee and snacks suggestion also didn't sit well on airlinesforums.com, an online gathering spot for pilots and airline maintenance crews. ""Must have been 'Alien' blood to dissolve metal,"" posted one user, referring to the film with the space monster with acid blood. Suggestions on the site are rampant that American's maintenance contractors bore responsibility for the problems. American, however, has said maintenance work was not to blame for the problems. Vice President David Campbell also dismissed the possibility that the problems could be linked to an ongoing labor dispute. Last month, a judge threw out American's contract with its pilots union. Since then, pilots have staged what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket. More than 1,000 American flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed in the past month alone. Airline management has blamed the situation on pilots filing what it says are frivolous reports about aircraft problems. The pilots union has denied management's assertion. ""I really have a difficult time believing that it's actually sabotage,"" Campbell said. American Airlines also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year. Who still wants to fly American? CNN's Vivian Kuo, Carma Hassan, Jim Barnett and George Howell contributed to this report.","NEW: Expert Bill Waldock calls the airline's explanation ""curious""

"(CNN) -- International leaders expressed their condolences Sunday after the death of former Czech President Vaclav Havel, one of the leading anti-Communist dissidents of the 1970s and 1980s. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso: ""He was a true European and has been a champion of democracy and liberty throughout his life. I recall with great emotion the contacts we have had while he held the office, first as President of Czechoslovakia and then of the Czech Republic and also as a European personality and man of culture. Vaclav Havel's name will remain forever attached to the reunification of Europe and the expansion of its values to Central and Eastern Europe."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague: ""I was greatly saddened to hear of the death of Vaclav Havel. As the Czech Republic's first democratically elected president, he played a pivotal role in the development of freedom in Europe. He will be remembered as a leader who helped create a modern democracy in the Czech Republic. His achievements are historic and will live after him. He will be sorely missed."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""A man of culture and a writer of great talent, Vaclav Havel was the incarnation of tireless commitment to democracy and freedom. His ascension to the presidency after the Velvet Revolution in 1989 capped a life entirely dedicated to the fight against totalitarianism and for the defense of values that inspired his action -- tolerance, the promotion of human rights and the struggle against oppression. With the death of Vaclav Havel, the Czech Republic loses one of its great patriots, France loses a friend, Europe loses one of its sages."" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe: ""With him, we lose a great European conscience and France loses a friend. The French have not forgotten the meeting between the dissident and his companions with President Mitterand in Prague on December 9, 1988. They have not forgotten the courage and the force of conviction of the herald of human rights. They remain very attached to the legacy of the poet-president, a man of letters who became a statesman, an author of the most beautiful pages in the history of democracy."" U.S. President Barack Obama: ""I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing today of Vaclav Havel, a playwright and prisoner of conscience who became president of Czechoslovakia and of the Czech Republic. Having encountered many setbacks, Havel lived with a spirit of hope, which he defined as 'the ability to work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed.' His peaceful resistance shook the foundations of an empire, exposed the emptiness of a repressive ideology, and proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon."" Former U.S. President George W. Bush: ""His strong voice for human liberty changed the course of his country and crossed continents. In the days of Communist rule over Czechoslovakia, he was viewed as an enemy of the state for ridiculing the pretensions of an oppressive government. The most subversive act of the playwright from Prague was telling the truth about tyranny. And when that truth finally triumphed, the people elected this dignified, charming, humble, determined man to lead their country. Unintimidated by threats, unchanged by political power, Vaclav Havel suffered much in the cause of freedom and became one of its greatest heroes.""","Hague: Havel ""played a pivotal role in the development of freedom in Europe""

"(CNN) -- Authorities continued their search for bodies Wednesday, two days after one of India's worst ferry accidents claimed at least 100 lives. The ferry sank Monday evening as it sailed along the Brahmaputra River in the remote northeastern state of Assam. Officials said the vessel -- which was overcrowded and carrying as many as 300 people -- apparently broke apart when it was about to dock after a storm. Assam home commissioner Jishnu Barua told CNN 90 people were rescued, while 19 bodies have been recovered so far. Officials said the number of recovered bodies was downgraded from 40 due to inaccurate statements from witnesses. Barua said divers have been used to retrieve bodies from the swollen river but have had limited success. He admitted the chances of finding more survivors in the fast-flowing river almost 40 hours after the accident were slim. Indian officials have also requested help from Bangladesh as they suspect many corpses have been swept downstream into the neighboring country, Barua said. Meanwhile, local villagers described the horror that awaited them on Monday night as they arrived on the scene in torrential rain to help. ""We searched the bank for survivors. We found some jumping onto the land, but about an hour later, bodies were floating and getting pushed to the bank,"" Motlef Ali told the Times of India. A survivor from the boat described how many of his fellow passengers were prevented from escaping. ""The storm lasted almost an hour. It was close to the bank and many of us managed to jump on to the ground. But then the boat capsized and many were trapped inside,"" Joynal Abedin told the Times of India. An inquiry into the incident has now been ordered, officials said. Boat accidents are nothing new in remote areas of India, where ferries are often overcrowded and in poor condition due to lax safety standards. In 2010, a boat packed with Muslim pilgrims capsized in West Bengal in eastern India, killing at least 79.","Ferry sank Monday evening as it sailed along the Brahmaputra River in Assam state .

"(CNN) -- Chevron filed an appeal with Ecuador's National Court to review a ruling that it must pay billions of dollars in damages for oil pollution in the Amazon rain forest. In addition to the $8.6 billion ruling, the court said that Chevron must publicly apologize to Ecuador, and if it fails to do so, the fine will be doubled to nearly $18 billion. The ruling Chevron is appealing was handed by an Ecuadorian appeals court on January 4, nearly a year after the panel received the case, the state-run Andes news agency reported. The case stems from claims that the company had a detrimental impact on Amazonian communities where it operated. Chevron says it has filed the appeal with Ecuador's National Court of Justice. ""Throughout the course of this litigation, judges corruptly operating in concert with the plaintiffs' lawyers have created, rather than corrected, injustice,"" Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president and general counsel, said Friday. Chevron's appeal is the latest in 19 years of litigation between Amazon residents and Texaco, which was later purchased by Chevron. At the time of the January ruling, Chevron said the appeals court decision ""is another glaring example of the politicization and corruption of Ecuador's judiciary that has plagued this fraudulent case from the start."" The company alleges that reports and evidence against it were fraudulent, and that bribes and corruption led to the original decision against it. ""Chevron does not believe that the Ecuador ruling is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of law. The company will continue to seek to hold accountable the perpetrators of this fraud,"" the company said in a statement. When an Ecuadorian court handed down the original ruling last year, both Chevron and the Amazonian residents appealed. Chevron argued the verdict was the product of fraud and the plaintiffs said the size of the award was too small in comparison to what would be needed to do a real clean-up. The case, Aguinda v. ChevronTexaco, was originally filed in New York in 1993 on behalf of 30,000 inhabitants of Ecuador's Amazon region. The suit was eventually transferred to the Ecuadorian court and Ecuadorian jurisdiction. The lawsuit alleges that Texaco used a variety of substandard production practices in Ecuador that resulted in pollution that decimated several indigenous groups in the area, according to a fact sheet provided by the Amazon Defense Coalition. According to the group, Texaco dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways, abandoned more than 900 waste pits, burned millions of cubic meters of gases with no controls and spilled more than 17 million gallons of oil due to pipeline ruptures. Cancer and other health problems were reported at higher rates in the area, the group says. Chevron says Texaco was partnered with an Ecuadorian oil company when it operated in Ecuador, and that it spent $40 million on remediation efforts to clean up roughly one-third of the sites in which it worked -- an amount reflective of its 37% share of the oil-producing consortium with Petroecuador. It says its cleanup efforts were certified and approved by the Ecuardorian government and blames Petroecuador for any ongoing pollution at sites where it was the sole operator, according to documents on the Chevron website regarding the lawsuit and its history of operations in the South American country.","Chevron's appeal continues 19 years of litigation .

"(DEPARTURES.com) -- A trip to Nashville, Tennessee, and Florence, Alabama, unearths a bounty of Southern-made artisanal luxuries. One day, while standing on a street corner in Vienna in the late summer, designer Natalie Chanin realized suddenly that August should really mean sunshine and fresh tomatoes. The Alabama native was a successful, Paris-based stylist working on a film set in Austria at the time, living out of a suitcase and wondering if she had packed enough winter clothes. That realization led to an overhaul and reconfiguration of her life, culminating several years later when she returned to her hometown of Florence, Alabama, to launch her sustainable-clothing label, Project Alabama. Now in its second evolution as Alabama Chanin, the award-winning line is still based in a warehouse just north of Florence. What about the South pulled her back and continues to do so for others? We flew down to find out. The South of the northern imagination—that memorialized by William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, Harper Lee and Robert Penn Warren—is afflicted by its past and lost in the present. Ironic, then, that much of this decade's Southern renaissance is built on the foundations of old traditions: quilting, work clothes, garden kitchens, comfort food. We once mistook this elegant clarity for oversimplification. But in today's hyper-communicative, superfast, deeply insecure culture, tradition has been reanimated into a new worldly form. Florence, with a population of 39,000, sits on the Tennessee River in Alabama's northwestern corner, a two-hour drive from any of the nearest three airports. It calls itself ""Alabama's Renaissance City"" and has more clothing labels than restaurants. (Visit one of Alabama Chanin's monthly retreats and take a tour of the studio.) To fill that void, we flew into Nashville first—an old metropolis of the New South—for the food alone. The longtime music capital has always been home to the creative and the cosmopolitan, but the new two-feet-on-the-ground sophistication of the cooking has attracted the attention of a much wider audience, and the city is having a moment. Areas outside the city center, like 12th Avenue South and East Nashville, are being reengineered from the inside out. An old gas station has been converted into a store for tailored denim by the label Imogene + Willie; an 18th-century factory building houses City House, one of the best restaurants in town; and an old trailer is the mobile vintage-clothing store High Class Hillbilly. We crave the locally made finds that have the simplicity of an heirloom tomato. And right now, it's all about returning to roots—something the South most definitely provides. Here are our 10 new reasons to love the old South. © 2010 American Express Publishing Corporation.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The former California home and headquarters of civil rights and labor leader Cesar E. Chavez was added to the National Register of Historic Places, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced Thursday. Nuestra Señora Reina de la Paz (La Paz) served as the headquarters of the Chavez's United Farm Workers of America (UFW) and his residence during his last 22 years, from 1971 to 1993. The structure is located in the Tehachapi Mountains of Kern County, California. ""Cesar Chavez is one of the heroes of the 20th century, leading a nonviolent movement that improved working conditions for agricultural workers and bettered the lives of thousands of Hispanic men and women and other minorities throughout the United States,"" Salazar said in a statement. ""By adding La Paz, now known as the National Chavez Center, to the National Register of Historic Places, we are honoring his legacy and inviting Americans to learn more about the life and work of this extraordinary man."" Added Paul F. Chavez, Cesar Chavez's middle son and president of the Cesar Chavez Foundation: ""For my father, La Paz was a personal refuge from bitter struggles in agricultural valleys and big cities, a spiritual harbor where he recharged batteries, drew fresh inspiration and prepared for the battles ahead.

"(CNN) -- Watching the premiere of ""The Informant!"" -- the Matt Damon movie about a high-level FBI mole at a large multinational company -- was the mole himself, Mark Whitacre. Mark Whitacre, right, at the premiere of 'The Informant' with Matt Damon. The movie is a dark comic take on the three years Whitacre -- a former divisional president of Archer Daniels Midland, the US-based food additive giant -- spent working undercover to break a global price-fixing conspiracy. Whitacre recognized real episodes in his life on the big screen, such as trying to fix a hidden tape player during a meeting and his delusional belief he would be made CEO of the company as a reward for his undercover work. But what you won't see in the movie are the events of August 9, 1995, six weeks after an FBI raid blew the case into public attention. It was two days after ADM fired Whitacre and accused him of embezzling millions from the company. His FBI partners for the previous three years would no longer speak with him. On that day, Whitacre sat alone in his car with its engine running inside a closed garage and slowly lost consciousness. He was hoping to end his life as surely as he had ended his career. A gardener found him unconscious. Some scenes just can't be played for laughs. ""There was nothing comical in the reality of the story,"" said Whitacre, who eventually spent nearly nine years in prison for his role in the price-fixing scheme and revelations he siphoned off $9 million from the company while he was working for the FBI. For Whitacre, 'The Informant!' is a study in his own mental illness, as he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after hospitalization for his suicide attempt. His meeting with Damon at the premiere was the first time the pair met. Damon told him he hoped they portrayed his illness in a sensitive way, Whitacre said. ""He didn't want to talk to a 52-year-old Mark Whitacre while preparing for the role, the Mark Whitacre who went to prison, who has been treated for bipolar disorder, who is now COO of a company,"" said Whitacre, who is now an executive for a small food supplement maker. ""He wanted to portray the 35-year-old Mark Whitacre, otherwise it would make it difficult to portray the delusions I had at that time."" The fix is in . For companies and regulators, the 1997 conviction of ADM was a landmark event, the first antitrust action in the United States since World War II and a case that has spurred price-fixing investigations around the world. ""As a result of this case, the Department of Justice and the FBI started looking around to see if they could find any other cases like this,"" said Dean Paisley, a retired FBI agent who supervised the undercover ADM work. ""This used to be relatively unusual until the (ADM) case came to light,"" said John Connor, a Purdue University researcher on cartel activity, who was an expert witness in the government's case against ADM. ""Back in 1993 you'd see maybe one or two global (price-fixing schemes) being discovered ... in the past three years or so, there are about 50 a year."" Price-fixing schemes -- where a cartel of manufacturers inflate prices against market demand -- cost consumers untold millions each year. In the ADM case, it was found that in the three-year period of investigation the company's cartel activity with manufacturers in Japan and Korea inflated prices by at least $200 million. The ADM case resulted in a record $100 million fine in 1997 -- a figure long since dwarfed. Last month Japanese company Epson agreed to pay $26 million for its role in price-fixing LCD panels used in mobile phones in the U.S. Several other companies, including Sharp, LG and Hitachi, have already pleaded guilty in the case and paid fines of more than $600 million. Just last week, the Hungarian government fined Visa Europe, MasterCard and seven commercial banks a total of $10.4 million for price fixing bank fees (Visa and MasterCard are appealing that decision). Flawed heroes . A sign of cartel activity is usually a sharp and uniform increase in price with a contraction in demand. ""But, in fact, in the last 15 or 20 years (governments) have relied almost exclusively on whistle-blowers to make their cases,"" Connor said. And as Whitacre showed, whistle blowers often don't have noble motives. ""The movie should be taken very, very seriously,"" said Sam Antar, a CPA who turned government witness against his employer in the 1980's. ""In white-collar cases, the governments have to rely on informants ... in effect, relying on unsavory characters to make their case,"" said Antar, who now advises government agencies on white-collar crime. ""What happened in 'The Informant,' is he had an agenda to become head honcho of the company,"" Antar said. ""The mistake the FBI agents made in the movie is they fell in love with their witness. It turned out there was a dark side they didn't know about."" Whitacre said he began stealing millions from the company while working for the FBI, in part, as a financial backstop in case things went wrong. ""I had this sense of false entitlement, like they owe me this ... after all, the company was stealing hundreds of millions."" The stress of his double-life undoubtedly added to his mental woes, said Paisley, the original FBI supervisor in the case. He points out that undercover FBI agents receive surveillance training and are pulled for psychological evaluation once a year -- Whitacre received none of that. ""There were no provisions for similar checks and balances with Whitacre,"" Paisley said. ""He had no ideas what he was getting into when he agreed to cooperate ... we had no idea it would last three years."" Although Whitacre has served his time, Paisley and other agents involved in his case are seeking a presidential pardon. ""He really screwed up by stealing,"" Paisley said. ""Be that as it may, how many hundreds of millions would have been stolen if (ADM) wasn't stopped by Mark Whitacre? He is a national hero, in my eyes.""","The ADM price-fixing case was a landmark in global antitrust prosecution .
Global price-fixing investigations have skyrocketed since the ADM scam .

"(Financial Times) -- Japanese carmakers appear to be suffering significant sales declines in China over a flare-up over disputed islands in the East China Sea, after Mazda reported that sales in the country fell 35 per cent year on year in September. Mazda is the first Japanese automaker to report China sales data since violent anti-Japanese protests erupted in Chinese cities last month over the Senkaku islands -- a small chain of islets controlled by Japan but claimed by China. The September data give shape to reports that Chinese consumers are shunning Japanese cars and other products in response to the territorial conflict, which has aroused nationalist passions on both sides. Thousands of Chinese and Japanese tourists have cancelled trips to each other's countries. Chinese customs officials are also reported to be holding up imports of Japanese electronics components, chemicals and other goods at Chinese ports. Cars are a particularly visible symbol of Japan's economic presence in China. In an incident that has come to symbolise the public rage unleashed by the dispute over the Senkaku islands -- which China calls the Diaoyu -- a Chinese man in Xi'an was severely beaten by a mob that discovered him driving a Toyota Corolla. Mazda is Japan's fifth-largest carmaker and has a relatively small presence in China. But analysts say its problems are shared by other Japanese groups. Toyota was already cutting back production of cars and trucks for the Chinese market in the expectation of lower demand and others may follow suit. Many Japanese manufacturers shut down factories in China for several days during the worst of the protests in mid-September. Goldman Sachs estimates that sales of Japanese-brand cars in China will be 40 per cent lower in the six weeks to the end of October than the same period last year. September and October are the most important months for car sales in China, heightening the impact on production and profits. ""China has become a second source of earnings for the Japan auto industry after the US and anti-Japan sentiment there poses serious near-term damage to sales,"" Kota Yuzawa, a Tokyo-based analyst at Goldman, said in a recent report that looked at the impact on Toyota, Nissan and Honda -- Japan's biggest carmakers. Of the three, Nissan is the most exposed to the Chinese market and will suffer the biggest financial setback, Mr Yuzawa said. He cut his estimate for earnings per share at the company in the fiscal year to March by 9.5 per cent, to Y97.3, compared with reductions of 6.2 per cent for Honda and 2.4 per cent for Toyota. Mazda said it sold 13,258 vehicles in the country during the month. Nissan, Honda and Toyota are expected to report September China sales figures next week. Japanese carmakers were already on the defensive in China, a market whose blistering growth in recent years has made it a strategic priority for rival European, US and Korean brands. Supply disruptions caused by the 2011 earthquake compounded already existing issues of declining competitiveness, say auto analysts in China. LMC Automotive, a market research firm in Shanghai, estimates the collective share held by Japanese carmakers has shrunk almost four percentage points since 2009 to 22.8 per cent. European, American and even Korean carmakers have introduced new models that have captured the imagination of Chinese car buyers, while Japanese auto companies have stuck to models that are viewed as tired and even boring by mainland consumers. Lack of innovative new models has become an increasingly serious problem as the Chinese market has slowed from growth rates as high as 45 per cent per year, down to single-digits. This has led to cut-throat competition in China's crowded car market, which boasts as many as 100 carmakers.

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian judges released the captain of the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise liner from house arrest Thursday, but ordered him not to leave his home town while the case against him continues, his lawyer said. Francesco Schettino has been under house arrest in his home town of Meta di Sorrento, near Naples, since January 17. At least 30 people died when the cruise liner struck rocks and turned on its side off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13. Schettino faces allegations of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship, failing to report an accident to the coast guard and destroying a natural habitat, a prosecutor said this year. Giglio is a protected park. Schettino's lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, had argued for the lifting of the restrictions on his client, saying his behavior had been ""faultless."" The judge leading the preliminary investigations, Valeria Montesarchio, said it would be easy to keep Schettino under ""adequate supervision"" in Meta di Sorrento without house arrest because it is a small town, according to court documents released Thursday. In addition, the months Schettino has spent under house arrest have already produced a ""deterrent effect,"" Montesarchio said. Concordia disaster focuses attention on how cruise industry operates . The judge also lifted a provision barring Schettino from communicating with anyone apart from his lawyers and family. From the beginning, Leporatti said, the attitude of the captain had been ""totally collaborative, he has spoken on his defense but admitting his responsibilities, without trying to download them on others."" The lawyer said the judge's decision to order Schettino to stay in his home town was ""the least punitive measure"" available to him. Also on Thursday, Italian newspaper Corriere del Mezzogiorno published documents written by Schettino's lawyers that purport to be the captain's recollection of what happened on the night the Costa Concordia struck rocks off the Italian coast. ""No one, until then, had warned me that we had passed the point of turn on the fixed route. Luckily I saw the white froth on my left. It was a sign that made me give the order to tack to starboard, out of pure instinct. At that moment a divine hand has definitely landed on my head. If I had continued on that route, we hit the rock with the bow. It would have been a massacre,"" Schettino said, according to the newspaper. A court hearing on July 21 will start the examination of the enormous amount of technical information gathered in the wake of the disaster. Schettino's first officer, Ciro Ambrosio, and six other officers both on the ship and from the firm Costa in Genoa are under investigation over allegations including manslaughter, shipwreck and failure to report the accident, the prosecutor in the case has said. No one has been charged in connection with the shipwreck. Schettino previously has said managers of the Costa cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast. He has said the rock the ship struck was not indicated on his charts of the area. Salvage experts announced in May that efforts to raise the wrecked liner from the sea floor in one piece and tow it from the disaster site were getting under way. Covering a cruise ship disaster .

"(CNN) -- If you're landing in the middle of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, or the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, you'll probably spend much of your time inside the convention hall cheering and voting for your candidate and collecting all those colorful hats and buttons delegates like to wear. Yet there is much fun to be had beyond the convention walls in Tampa and Charlotte, even if you only have a little bit of free time in either city. With the Republican National Convention opening Monday, August 27, Tampa is up first. CNN.com decided to ask Tampa Tribune food writer Jeff Houck, author of the popular food blog, ""The Stew,"" for his nonpartisan recommendations for a good time in his city. Whether you just have an hour, an afternoon, a day or the luxury of an overnight trip, here are his recommendations for a great time. If you only have an hour: ""Tour the Tampa Theatre. Built in 1926, its interior, designed by architect John Eberson, makes it one of the most spectacular movie palaces in the country. Designed in the atmospheric style that mimics an outdoor Mediterranean setting, the ceiling blinks with 99 twinkling stars and puffy clouds that appear to float by. ""Taken over by the city of Tampa in the 1970s and placed on the National Register of Historic Places, Tampa Theatre remains home to independent films, first-run movies, classic flicks and local events. It is magical and wonderful and makes even the worst film at least 33% better just by showing it there. Plus, the theater is next door to the Hub, one of Tampa's best dive bars. You could spend an hour there hugging a PBR and picking songs on a nicotine-stained jukebox."" If you have an afternoon: ""Tour the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg. The home to works which span the surrealist master's entire career, the collection features 96 oil paintings, sculpture, photos, drawings and an archive of documents. Plus, the museum just moved into a spectacular new building worthy of his absurd body of work. ""It isn't every day you get to see ""The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus"" and ""The Hallucinogenic Toreador"" and the lobster phone. The gift shop is a must-visit. A set of Dali-designed tarot cards makes a lovely souvenir."" Take the whole day: ""You can't visit Florida and not go to a theme park. Spend the day in Tampa at the African-themed Busch Gardens Tampa Bay screaming your lungs bloody aboard the roller coaster SheiKra. With its delayed 90-degree drop after hanging 200 feet above Mother Earth, SheiKra is less of a thrill ride than a gravity propelled, 3,188-foot-long physics-induced exorcism. If that's not enough for you, there are other spine-rattling rides on which you can test your stomach's capacity for high-velocity jostling. And exotic animals. And beer."" The luxury of an overnight: ""In 1924, Thomas Rowe had a dream to build a pink castle on the sugar-fine sand of St. Petersburg Beach. His resort for the ultra-rich became what is now known as the Loews DonCeSar Resort. Posh doesn't begin to describe this 277-room playground. Anything that was good enough for F. Scott Fitzgerald should be good enough for you. ""Just know that the 'Pink Lady' is just feet from the shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico, the sunsets are spectacular, the food at the Maritana Grille is extraordinary and the rooms and day spa are beyond luxurious.

"Commerce City, Colorado (CNN) -- Maria Zepeda-Sanchez remembers the excitement of the ""change"" argument in 2008. ""There was really a change then,"" she said with a nostalgic smile. ""People were really anxious to have a new person."" Working the phones for President Barack Obama again four years later, though, change has a new -- and to her troubling -- meaning. ""Different. It's a little different,"" she said of the then and now reaction when calling Latino voters in Colorado. ""It was more hype I think back in 2008, yes."" And now? ""Some people are still really excited,"" Zepeda-Sanchez said during a brief break from her phone bank work. ""Others say, 'Oh, I don't know, well, I haven't made up my mind.'"" Then comes the sales pitch, and the new reality of incumbency -- of 2012. ""Well you say, 'he has done this, and this,'"" Zepeda-Sanchez told CNN. ""And they say, 'Well he promised a lot of things.'"" Latinos made up 13% of the Colorado vote four years ago, and 61% voted for then-Sen. Obama as he turned Colorado blue after GOP presidential victories in 1996, 2000 and 2004. But this time, battleground Colorado is tougher territory. Not that Latinos have switched loyalties and plan to give significantly higher support to GOP nominee Mitt Romney compared to John McCain four years ago. The question is not will Obama dominate the Latino vote, it is whether Latino turnout will rival 2008 levels -- here and in other key battlegrounds. Zepeda-Sanchez is a little worried. ""Yes, yes, it is a little bit harder,"" she says of the then and now. ""Sometimes some of them say, 'Well I don't know who to vote for - these two evils, you know.'"" She is a battle-tested volunteer. And shrugs off the idea that this time around is more discouraging. ""You go, 'You know, you voted for this person last time. Give him another chance. ... He needs four more years to do what he needs to do.'"" As critical as Latino turnout is for Obama in Colorado, the intensity -- and strength -- of the evangelical vote is a pivotal piece of Romney's path to victory in the state. ""He cannot win unless he wins convincingly among evangelicals,"" said Pastor Gino Geraci of the Cavalry South Denver Chapel in Littleton, a close-in Denver suburb. Math backs up that assessment; white evangelicals made up 23% of the Colorado electorate in 2008. ""Think about life, think about liberty, think about character and then cast your ballot,"" was part of Geraci's Sunday sermon at Calvary South Denver. Geraci steered clear of any mention of the candidates or political party from the pulpit, though in an interview he made it clear he will vote for Romney -- but not without some hesitation. ""I was a little frustrated because he seems to have equivocated on the issue of life, and then he has come down quite dramatically on the issue of life,"" Geraci said at a suburban sanctuary that was once a supermarket. In talking to many of his 1,200 congregants, Geraci said the consistent complaint is unhappiness with both major presidential candidates. ""The frustration of not wanting to vote for either,"" Geraci said. ""So I feel my role is to encourage people to vote."" Will they? Geraci said his conversations convince him the combination of economic and values concerns are going to motivate a high evangelical turnout -- ""a far greater turnout"" than in 2008. Visits to the competing campaign headquarters and satellite offices provide instant proof of the urgent emphasis on turnout - the so-called ground game, including nudging less reliable voters to take advantage of Colorado's early voting window, which opens October 22. ""We are, I believe, at ground zero in the presidential election,"" is the view of veteran Democratic strategist Michael Stratton. Heading into the final four weeks, Stratton said Colorado is again up for grabs -- and a new University of Denver poll released this past weekend backs that up. In the survey, Obama received 47% support to 43% for Romney. Just shy of six in 10 Coloradans said the economy was the top issue, and they gave Romney a slight edge (50%-to 45%) when asked which candidate would do a better job on the economy. Poll: Obama slightly ahead in Colorado, Romney won debate . ""Before the concept of red and blue, before the concept of purple, you remember they called Colorado a ticket splitter state,"" Stratton said in a coffee shop interview across the street from his Denver office. Bill Clinton won Colorado in 1992, but lost it in 1996. George W. Bush carried it twice, but never with more than 52% of the vote. Then Obama returned Colorado to the blue column in 2008, winning rather comfortably with 54%. Since then, however, unemployment in the state has risen a bit, from 7.2% when Obama took office to 8.2% now. In the University of Denver poll, 23% of Coloradans said their personal economic situation had improved over the past year, 41% said it has stayed the same, and 36% said it was worse. In addition to evangelicals, Stratton said Romney can safely count on deep support from the state's Mormon voters - like Romney members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. ""In some places, as you know, there are concerns about Mormonism,"" Stratton said. ""People here all know Mormons. They are family people. You won't hear as in some parts of the country, 'who are these people? Are they some weird cult or something?' ... The Mormon thing helps him here."" The keys for the president, he said, are healthy turnout among Latinos and a heavy focus on suburban women. On that front, Stratton believes the GOP convention gave Democrats some help. ""Some of this regressive rhetoric about getting rid of Planned Parenthood or taking birth control out of a women's health plan - that is troublesome to voters,"" Stratton said. ""Women are a larger majority of voters in Colorado than they are in a lot of states."" Both campaigns said having Denver as the site of last week's first presidential debate helped bring extra enthusiasm to their state organizations. ""It will be close here,"" Stratton said. ""It will be close in Colorado regardless."" More battleground coverage from CNN's John King: . Revived auto industry gives Obama advantage in Michigan .

"(CNN) -- Schoolchildren in Syria remain in the line of fire of the country's civil war, where shells and bombs deliver death and trauma into classrooms, UNESCO lamented Friday on World Teacher's Day. Many pupils and teachers dare not attend lessons, opting to take cover or flee with their families, leaving schools deserted. But the violence is forcing some classes literally underground, into caves. In the town of Jabal Zawiya, in the embattled Idlib province, the shrieks and laughter of children scurrying from class to class, while teachers rein them in with firm, gentle admonishments, have died out from the hallway of a large school, leaving it completely empty, with the exception of an arid pile of concrete rubble that fell when a shell blasted through the ceiling. Even with its battle scars, the school in Jabal Zawiya -- compared with Internet videos of damage done to other schools -- makes an almost intact impression. Video: Syrian rebels say they will kill Iranian hostages . But war has made the school too unsafe for children, explains local activist Abu Diyaa in a social media video posted Thursday to YouTube. ""Here we are during the school hours, and there is not a single student here,"" he says in the taut tone and gestures of a citizen turned journalist, as the wind lashes over his microphone. ""We were surprised that the school was hit by the regime shelling from jet fighters,"" he says, pointing to the gaping hole in the ceiling. Jabal Zawiya is a target of the indiscriminate bombing of civilians, according to Amnesty International, which investigated the town. ""Battlefield weapons and munitions -- unguided bombs dropped from the air and imprecise artillery shells and mortars, which have a wide impact radius and cannot be aimed at specific targets -- are now being used daily against residential areas, significantly increasing the number of civilian casualties,"" Amnesty said in a report on Jabal Zawiya in September. The Syrian children share a similar fate with students in conflict regions around the world, according to UNESCO. Read more: Who is arming the Syrian conflict? ""There are millions of teachers and children who are killed (globally) because of being in the classroom itself,"" says Pauline Rose, director of an independent annual report on education published by UNESCO. This year's report focused on education in regions beset with the violence. As Abu Diyaa steps inside a classroom, the camera reveals rows of empty desks. His voice echoes loudly off of desolate walls, as he walks viewers through the school, which has become a deadly trap. Read more: U.N. still has no plan for Syria . ""Not a single soul in this classroom; everyone left because they fear the random shelling and the attacks,"" he says. The Syrian government has justified military operations at schools in state media reports, stating that rebels have used them as bomb-making factories and weapons caches. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of events depicted in social media because of restrictions on journalists by the Syrian government and life-threatening dangers involved with reporting from inside the country. But the Syrian government confirmed in September to the United Nations Office at Geneva that more than 2,000 of the country's 22,000 schools had been damaged or destroyed. Abu Diyaa traipses silently back out into the open-air hallway, gazing down at the rubble crunching under his shoes, then the video abruptly cuts to another scene. iReport: Turbulence in the Middle East . The activist leads the camera into a dark, gray room, but his report has a happy ending, because the community and the school's teachers have not given up on their children, their future or their education. ""One thing that we found ... was that even in these conflict-ridden countries, there is a real desire for education,"" Rose says. ""It's a very flexible approach, but they really want education to continue for their children."" Jabal Zawiya's school and its children have gone into hiding -- in a cave in the countryside outside of town, not out of the ordinary in wartime Syria, says Amnesty. ""Some towns and villages have been virtually emptied of their residents, many of whom are now camping out in the surrounding countryside or hiding in caves."" Reminiscent of the stone schoolhouse in a Flintstones comic, the cave's interior is hewn by human hands into cubed-shaped real rooms. Spotlights shine down onto the children and glare into the camera. The cave school is in Kansafra, a small village near Jabal Zawiya, in a region known for its picturesque nature, flowing green fields and groves of olives, cherries and grapes -- none of it visible from the cavern classroom, which has no windows. Citizen reporter Abu Diyaa is again planted in front of the camera, but now, from behind hm, the lively voices of schoolchildren, raising their hands, eager to answer questions, drone into his microphone. They are calling out to a teacher, who is animating them to learn. The male instructor introduces Abu Diyaa to the group of first- through fourth-graders, who greet him graciously with a round of applause. ""So, why here?"" Abu Diyaa asks. The teacher, who does not give his name, replies: ""We want to keep educating our children, but in the city, there is always this imminent danger that the regime choppers or planes will bomb us or drop the TNT barrels."" Most of Jabal Zawiya's residents have fled with their children, he says. ""We are teaching whoever is left behind."" In spite of the hope that the cave's stone walls and the remote location offer real protection, it is still dangerous for the children to go to and from school, the teacher says. He groans about the lack of supplies, the small blackboard and the dim lighting. Read more: Thousands displaced as Syrian authorities demolish Hama neighborhood . Students behind him hold flashlights to help brighten the room. ""There is suffering, but thank God, we are moving on,"" he says. He is happy for what progress he can make with the students. Children in conflict situations ""need a classroom, where they feel safe,"" Rose says. ""They need a teacher who understands their psychological needs as well as their learning needs."" The teacher calls on a student seated on the floor to stand up and talk to Abu Diyaa, who asks him what he would like to tell President Bashar al-Assad's government. ""We want them to leave us alone; enough killing and destruction; we've had it,"" the boy says. ""We can't get close to our schools."" The interviewer follows up with a question: ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" ""A doctor,"" answers the boy. Read more: Turkey and Syria: Why neither side wants war . Read more: Syria's internally displaced languish in squalor at Turkish border . ""The children want to be able to learn,"" Rose insists, especially during upheaval. ""Those who were in school really had a desire to learn, and schooling gave them a sense of feeling normal."" Rose says aid organizations should boost education in their programs. ""Only 2% of humanitarian aid is spent on education,"" she says in a disappointed tone. She also wants to see the perpetrators of violence at schools brought to justice and their misdeeds publicized. In the Syrian cave, the teacher steers his class away from the camera and back to schoolwork. ""OK, let's recite what you learned today one more time,"" he calls out. Abu Diyaa gets out of his way then strikes up a conversation with a female teacher in the next room. The activist asks her to deliver a message to the government. ""We will be victorious,"" the teacher proclaims, ""and we will raise our children to be the teachers, the doctors and the engineers of tomorrow's Syria.""

A judge rejected the women's defense that they were acting from political motives, ruling that they had intended to insult the Orthodox Church and undermine public order. An Orthodox church leader has been widely reported as saying Putin's years in power have been a miracle from God. A day before the hearing, the Russian Orthodox Church appealed for leniency for the band members, according to state-owned Ria Novosti. The church believes repentance will ""benefit the souls"" of the band members, the news agency said. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called for the members' release, but said he is ""sickened"" by their actions.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea apparently test-launched three short-range missiles this week, the South Korean Defense Ministry said Friday, an indication that the reclusive state's military is operating normally after a leadership transition. ""We understand that North Korea test-fired three short-range missiles earlier this week,"" a spokesman for the Defense Ministry said Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity as is customary for South Korean military officials. He declined to comment further on the matter. North Korea often fires short-range missiles during military drills. They cause less concern in the region than longer-range missiles. The report of the test firings came nearly a month after the death of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, who had made the nation's military the focal point of his 17 years in power. Pyongyang fired a short-range missile over the East Sea on December 19, the day it announced Kim's death to the world. The regime has since anointed Kim's youngest son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un, as its new ""supreme leader."" State-run television aired video last weekend showing the younger Kim in a tank and on horseback, continuing efforts to build up his image as the rightful successor to his father. Kim Jong Un had received little attention from the North Korean state media until he emerged as the likely successor to his father in September 2010. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Seoul says it believes North Korea fired three short-range missiles earlier this week .

"(CNN) -- We know the point of the 2010 Census is to count us, one by one, to tally every last resident, but the massive project of course has more prying, if limited, interests. If the aqua- and black-tinted census form were a person, he would be like a slightly nosy seat mate on a plane, fitted out with an unfortunate '80s flair, someone oddly arbitrary in his inquiries while being intimately probing. Beyond the primary accounting, we're asked additional questions about the people we live with and our relationship to them; whether we hold a mortgage or rent; how old we are; our gender; whether we inhabit a second residence or even, alas, a prison; and then, inevitably, how we categorize ourselves racially. The boxes I can check to mark myself have certainly multiplied over the decades, allowing not just a single Asian category but broken out most progressively, it would seem, to other boxes for Vietnamese, Laotian, even Guamanian or Chamorran -- and then the one for me, Korean. The automatic response is to check this box, for that's what I am, at least in my bloodlines: My parents are from Korea, which was where I was born. My family immigrated when I was 3, and our predecessors inhabited the Korean Peninsula for as long as can be recalled. But as I consider the box, I have to pause. Perhaps it's because I'm a novelist, someone who spends his days telling stories in part by stripping away the surface realities, unraveling presumed identities, in the hopes of characterizing what it is and means to be alive. And thus my hesitance to mark the box. For despite a thorough pride in my Korean heritage and my wish to be no other, the complexities of what might seem a circumscribed identity (surely not a tenth as vast as ""white"" or ""black"") still feel too numerous to be so neatly contained. For my Korean-ness, especially in the context of America, is like no one else's: It is not at all like my first cousin's, who immigrated in his 20s and had to learn the language as an adult; not like my friend's, who was born in Los Angeles and grew up in a bustling enclave of Korean businesses and churches; not like the Korean adoptee's, who was raised in rural Oregon or Minnesota, being maybe the only Asian person in the county. Our shared heritage shows in our faces, but given the differing nature of our experiences and the character of our respective communities, each of us has profoundly varying conceptions of our sense of belonging, cultural ties, even future possibility -- in short, of who we are. If I had made up the census form, the Korean box would necessarily have dozens, maybe hundreds or even thousands of sub-boxes nested inside, boxes for whether we dream in the native language, for how often we Skype with folks in Seoul, whether we wear shoes or go barefoot in the house, if we prefer our kimchee fresher or riper or perhaps not at all. Each form would have to be an epic novel of boxes, its combinations approaching the infinite, a document so vast and particular and dense that the boxes themselves would at some point begin to blur, perhaps disappear, the marks coalescing into something so singular that they would eventually take on a life itself, which is always shifting, dynamic, at last uncountable.","Chang-rae Lee: If census form were a person, he would be the nosy seat mate on a plane .
Lee will tick Korean box but knows his Korean-ness in America is like no one else's .

"(CNN) -- Honda is recalling about 268,000 CR-V vehicles due to concerns about the power window master switch, which could start a fire. The vehicles affected are from model years 2002 to 2006, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In severe conditions, rain water entering the driver's side window can enter the master power window switch, Honda said in a statement Saturday. Such exposure to liquids can cause electrical resistance in the switch, which could cause it to overheat, smoke and start a fire. Four switch fires -- but no crashes or injuries -- have been reported, Honda said. Because a switch failure and fire could happen even if the car is off, ""owners are advised to park outside until the recall repair has been performed,"" the NHTSA said. Honda is asking affected CR-V owners to go to an authorized dealer to have their master power window switch inspected and repaired or replaced.","The affected CR-Vs are from model years 2002 to 2006 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Egyptian-American man behind the inflammatory film ""Innocence of Muslims"" denied Wednesday violating the terms of his probation from a 2010 bank fraud conviction. Mark Basseley Youssef made the denial in a federal courtroom during a proceeding in which prosecutors are seeking to revoke the probation. The amateur filmmaker from Cerritos, California, denied each of the eight instances in which prosecutors alleged he violated his supervised release from federal custody. He is now being held without bail. An evidentiary hearing on the charges will be held November 9. The filmmaker was identified in initial news accounts last month as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the name used in the bank fraud case. But the probation revocation case lists the defendant as Mark Basseley Youssef, which the filmmaker stated in court last month is his legal name. The use of aliases is among the allegations that the prosecutors are citing in their case to revoke Youssef's probation and return him to prison for two years. Specifically, prosecutors are accusing Youssef of using a name other than his legal one in December 2010; possessing a driver's license under the Nakoula name; possessing a fraudulent driver's license; using the name Sam Bacile on August 7, 2011, the name he allegedly used in making the controversial film; and falsely telling his probation officer last month that he hadn't used the Bacile name. Youssef is also accused of falsely telling his probation officers on September 15 that his role in the film was limited solely as the writer. Youssef garnered international attention following protests against his film throughout the Muslim world. His film was initially implicated in the violent demonstration last month in Libya that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead last month. U.S. officials initially said the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi and a nearby U.S. annex came as protesters outside the consulate rallied against the online video that offensively portrays Islam's Prophet Mohammed. That explanation has shifted with time. The Obama administration now says the incident was a terrorist attack, occurring 11 years to the day after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon. After Wednesday's court hearing, Youssef's attorney told reporters that his client ""had nothing to do with the violence that occurred in the Middle East as a result of the film. ""Clearly it was pre-planned,"" attorney Steve Seiden said about the Benghazi incident. FBI visits site of attack in Libya . The defendant is a Coptic Christian, a religious minority in Egypt where Copt-Muslim relations are tense, authorities say. His film, backed by hard-core anti-Islam groups in the United States, is a low-budget project that was largely ignored when trailers were posted on YouTube in English last June. But protests erupted in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories when an Arabic translation of the trailer was released a few weeks before the anniversary of September 11. A Chechen court ruled the film to be extremist and banned it in the Russian republic, according to information minister Murat Tagiyev. State Department officials: Benghazi attack 'unprecedented' The amateurish film portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, buffoon, ruthless killer and child molester. Islam categorically forbids any depictions of Mohammed, and blasphemy is an incendiary taboo in the Muslim world. When news of his movie first broke, the filmmaker identified himself as Sam Bacile and told The Wall Street Journal he was a 52-year-old Israeli-American real estate developer from California. He said Jewish donors had financed his film. But Israel's Foreign Ministry said there was no record of a Sam Bacile with Israeli citizenship. 'Innocence of Muslims' actress sues filmmaker, YouTube . A production staff member who worked on the film in its initial stages told CNN that a different name was filed on the paperwork for the Screen Actors Guild: Abenob Nakoula Bassely. A public records search showed an Abanob B. Nakoula residing at the same address as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. Another staffer who worked on the film said he knew the producer as Sam Bassil. That's how he signed a personal check to pay staff. In the bank fraud conviction, Youssef served one year in federal prison at Lompoc, California, but officials couldn't say recently whether he paid any of the court-ordered restitution of $794,700, according to probation department officials and court records. While on probation, Youssef was also prohibited from accessing computers or any device that can access the Internet without approval from his probation officer. U.S. official sought more security for Benghazi post . Meanwhile, the U.S. House Oversight Committee held a hearing Wednesday on the administration's handling of the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy rebutted criticism by Republicans of an alleged lack of preparedness ahead of the consulate attack and a shifting response by the Obama administration following the assault. ""We regularly assess risk and resource allocation, a process involving the considered judgments of experienced professionals on the ground and in Washington, using the best available information,"" Kennedy told the Republican-controlled committee. The assault on the U.S. compound was ""an unprecedented attack by dozens of heavily armed men,"" Kennedy said.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- China's new found wealth has seen an explosion in the number of new developments springing up in what is, arguably, the world's biggest building boom. The construction of the Linked Hybrid project is underway in Beijing. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Beijing, which has transformed into a virtual construction zone as the city undergoes an Olympic makeover. Once a flat cityscape in the shadow of the formidable Forbidden City, Beijing has been struck by skyscraper fever. The city is now an architect's playground with foreign ""starchitects,"" like Norman Foster flocking to the country armed with individual creations that push aesthetic and technological boundaries. And the latest addition to the Beijing skyline is no exception. Standing on the edge of the former site of  the city's historic walls are a series of eight asymmetrical towers that bestride the smog-laden landscape like a colossus. Dubbed the Beijing Linked Hybrid, this architectural maverick has certainly pushed the design envelope to its very limit. The brainchild of New York architect Steven Holl, the mixed-use unit is a ring of eight 21-story towers, linked at the 20th floor by gently sloping public sky bridges, lined with galleries, cafes, restaurants, bars and shops. The development has been widely praised for its forward thinking sustainable design that includes a waste water recycling plant that sits beneath the complex and one of the world's largest geothermal systems, which eliminates the need for boilers or electrical air conditioners. It also has green roofs, filters to protect residents from pollution and large ponds to harvest recycled rainwater. The complex comes with its own Hyatt hotel and the 15-acre grounds feature everything from a basketball court to tai chi platforms, a cinematheque, bank, dry cleaners and even a kindergarten. For its 2,500 inhabitants, there are enough facilities and services to ensure they never have to leave the confines of the complex--except maybe to go to work-- when it opens in October 2008. Linked Hybrid is, in effect, a city within a city. Holl, who is also a professor at Columbia University, describes it as a ""visionary project on all levels"" and an ""ultra modern expression of ecological urban living."" However, for all its plaudits, the Linked Hybrid project has attracted many criticisms. Among them is that its brand of green luxury won't come cheap. With apartments selling for 44,000 Yuan, or $6,000, per square meter, it can only appeal to China's nouveaux riches, further creating social division in what is already a deprived area of the city. Sound Off: Tell us what you think of the Linked Hybrid project. Critics also argue its city within a city element has isolationist overtones, reminiscent of gated communities that are becoming increasingly popular around the world. For Washington-based architect and urbanist, Howard Decker, buildings like Linked Hybrid form part of the problem and not the solution, although he applauds the efforts to ""green-up"" the project. ""This is a remarkably cold, hostile, hermetic place,"" he tells CNN. ""The disconnect with the surrounding urban fabric emphasizes the sense that the Linked Hybrid's principle references are to itself, not the larger city. ""The project is inward focused, the towers gathered around a central water feature at the middle of the towers. The towers seem to be in a conversation with one another, but not necessarily with the surrounding city."" Decker, a former Chief Curator of Washington's National Building Museum, believes the concept of a street in the sky is ""antagonistic"" to how cities should work. ""First, last and always, great places, great cities, begin with great public domains, and in particular with their streets. We all own the street: it is the place where we all belong, where we can move and linger, where we can erect monuments to tell our stories, where we can sit and watch our neighbors, or sit and sip and read the news of the day."" ""One of the joys of urban life is the collision of uses, the chance to sit and observe the passing scene, to see and be seen,"" he adds. This, he contends, cannot be done within Linked Hybrid where the inhabitant takes on more of an observational role. ""In the instance of the Linked Hybrids, this experience seems more like being in an observation tower, and less like being in the middle of a bustling, alive, exciting city,"" he says. Chief among the criticisms the Linked Hybrid project has attracted is that it is entirely out of context with its environment and ""desecrates"" the former imperial city. Linked Hybrid is sited just 2.5 miles from the Forbidden City and its residents can apparently see into the former palace on a ""clear day,"" Holl tells CNN. But Holl is adamant this is no 21st Century Forbidden City. ""Linked Hybrid is no more isolationist than Greenwich Village in New York,"" he says. ""We modeled it on the Rockefeller Center. Anyone can go in but of course the owner reserves the right to refuse entry. ""But people need to come in to allow the shops and commercial base to be successful."" Furthermore, Holl rejects assertions that this is ""fortress architecture"" designed to keep all but the very rich out. He said: ""It's a very open and porous building,"" he says. ""It's free passage and the very opposite of a gated community. Our scheme is going against what's currently being built in China. ""What is being built now are point towers, isolated at the base. Gated communities with no services. I believe that we had to make a project that has a vision for urban interaction, one that has services, and is open to the public. There are actually 15 different ways to enter the complex."" However, the concept of a city within a city, one that appears disconnected from its surrounding environment, rests uneasily with some, who see it as the stuff of dystopic science fiction. Some, like Beijing-based designer Mi Qiu, believe China ought to preserve more of its traditional housing forms like the centuries-old villages and hutong--neighborhoods traversed by narrow, winding alleys. ""These new buildings are totally different--they are just dumped down as if from nowhere. There is no harmony or overall concept or town planning,"" Qiu said in a BBC interview. But as China hurtles headlong into rampant modernization and urbanization, producing millions of new homeowners, its social fabric and thousands of years of its history will no doubt become fundamentally, and irrevocably, altered.","Beijing is in the grip of a building boom that has transformed its skyline .

For now, officials have confirmed eight deaths: four French citizens, one German, one Italian, one Nepali and one Spanish. Twelve climbers were injured, said Binod Singh, a Nepali police spokesman. The avalanche, which struck around 5 a.m. Sunday, was most likely caused by a piece of ice the size of six or seven football fields that fell from a glacier above the camp, said Christian Trommsdorff, vice president of the National Syndicate of High Mountain Guides in Chamonix, France. One of the survivors, Frenchman Arnaud Manel, said Monday that he was in a tent with two other people when large amounts of snow began to fall on it. He said he managed to break the icy tent open and get out, and then rolled for what he thought was about 200 meters (655 feet) in the snow. ""When I stopped rolling, I was neck deep in snow,"" said Manel, a 42-year-old surgeon. ""I was only wearing a T-shirt. I couldn't breathe."" He said enough of the snow around him melted to allow him to clamber out. He said that he managed to save one friend, but that another, buried deeper in the snow, died. Another survivor, American Glen Plake, was inside his tent reading Bible verses when the avalanche swept 300 meters (985 feet) down the mountain, according to Trey Cook, the editor in chief of EpicTV.com. He spoke with Cook by satellite phone. EpicTV.com makes films about skiing, climbing and other adventure sports. Plake said that when he stopped moving, he was still in his sleeping bag, in his tent and was still wearing the headlamp he'd been using to read. Plake lost a few front teeth and suffered an eye injury, Cook said. Plake had planned to descend from the summit on skis without the aid of oxygen, according to Cook. The avalanche struck two camping areas for mountaineers, one at 6,600 meters (21,650 feet), and another about 500 meters (1,640 feet) below, according to Yograj Kadel of Simrik Air, which participated in the rescue efforts. The mountain is 8,163 meters (26,780 feet) high. Cook said Plake told him that the avalanche destroyed all 25 tents at one of the camping zones and bashed and moved 12 tents in the other. Two French expeditions were on the mountain when the avalanche struck, a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. Two French climbers were among the missing, she said. Among those confirmed dead was Marti Gasull of Spain, described by the nonprofit Pro-Language Platform in Barcelona as one of the leading Catalan language activists in the country. ""He had a passion for the mountains. He was committed to the Catalan culture and language and admired for his human side and his commitment to our country,"" the group said in a posting on its website. Kenton Cool, a mountain climber from England who reached the summit of Manaslu in 2010, told CNN that the weather during the post-monsoon season can be unsettled. His friends on the mountain told him that in the past 10 days or so, there had been ""quite high levels of snow on the mountain,"" he said. Teams normally wait for new snow to settle before leaving camp. Cool, who said Manaslu had a ""fearsome reputation,"" predicted that searchers will have a hard time finding some of the people still on the mountain. The area where the avalanche happened is the site of large crevasses. ""It will be hard to know exactly where everyone was,"" he said. ""It will be hard to find the bodies, let alone retrieve them."" According to Nepal tourism officials, 231 foreign mountaineers from 25 teams were attempting to climb the mountain in the autumn season that ends in November.

"(CNN) -- Almost a year has passed since Tiffany Hartley's husband was shot and killed while on a personal watercraft on Falcon Lake, which sits on the border and is shared between Texas and Mexico. Now she has sued the State Department, the Justice Department and the FBI in an attempt to get answers about what happened that day and why no one has been brought to justice in the killing of David Hartley. It is believed that he was shot by members of the Zetas drug cartel, but no one has been arrested or even named as a suspect in his death. With the help of Judicial Watch, an organization dedicated to investigating corruption, Tiffany Hartley filed the three freedom of information act lawsuits Friday. ""We are just requesting information, anything regarding our case,"" she told CNN affiliate KRGV on Monday. ""It's a disgrace that as a wife and as a victim who was there, to not release anything."" David Hartley's mother, Sue Hartley, said the family was desperate for any information from the investigation. ""I think they've shut the door on finding David. I'm still begging for help,"" she said. Tiffany Hartley spoke Monday after testifying at a congressional field hearing in Brownsville, Texas. She recounted the story of how, ahead of a move back to Colorado from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, the couple decided to enjoy Falcon Lake one last time. The crossed the lake on their Sea-Doo personal watercraft into Mexican waters, to the submerged ruins at Viejo Guerrero. It was on their way back to the U.S. side of the lake that armed men started shooting at them, she said. David Hartley was shot in the head, and Tiffany Hartley was unable to retrieve his body as the bullets kept coming. ""It's only by the grace of God that I am here today,"" she testified. Her information requests to the government agencies were simply an attempt to get information that she wasn't getting from investigators on either side of the border. A Mexican investigation to look for the body and find the killers dried up after the lead investigator was found decapitated. Early on, authorities surmised the couple had stumbled into the middle of a drug transaction, as the area is widely known as a Mexican drug cartel's stomping ground. Zapata County Sheriff Sigi Gonzalez said there were reports of fishermen on the lake being warned away from the Mexican side as long as a year before Hartley's shooting. Gonzalez, who patrols the Falcon Lake area, testified that he knew the names of people who were possibly among the shooters and had information on where the orders to shoot came from. Unfortunately, he said, Mexican officials have not moved forward with anything. ""The men who murdered David are right across the river. They aren't in Afghanistan; they aren't in Iraq. They're in our own backyard. The cartel members are taking over Mexico, and they are killing anyone who gets in their way,"" Tiffany Hartley said.","Tiffany Hartley is suing for information about her husband's death .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole has been charged by the Football Association (FA) after he called them a ""bunch of twats"" during a Twitter rant on Friday. Cole was responding to an independent report into an allegation of racism against Chelsea captain John Terry, in which the panel cast ""considerable doubt"" over the 31-year-old's evidence. Terry, who retired from international football over the affair, was found guilty of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand, banned for four matches and fined US$350,000. When Cole learned of the FA panel's suggestion he had ""evolved"" the evidence he gave to the investigation he responded by tweeting: 'Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFTWATS.' He apologized unreservedly hours later but he has now been charged with misconduct. Cole is currently on international duty with England, preparing for the World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland. A short statement on the FA's website read: ""Chelsea FC's Ashley Cole has been charged by the FA in relation to a Twitter comment which was improper and/or brought the game into disrepute. ""Cole has until 4pm on Thursday 11 October 2012 to respond to the charge."" Terry was also tried in a criminal court after his altercation with Ferdinand, the brother of Manchester United defender Rio, in which he admitted calling Anton ""a f******g black c***."" He claimed he was repeating words that Ferdinand had said to him, asking his opponent if he thought he had been the subject of racial abuse. Terry was found not guilty in July but the FA found him guilty on 27 September, using the ""balance of probabilities"" as its standard of proof as opposed to the ""beyond reasonable doubt"" ruling used in a criminal trial. The FA panel said: ""We are driven to conclude not just that it is 'highly unlikely' that Mr. Ferdinand accused Mr. Terry on the pitch of calling him a 'black c***', but that he did not."" The organization stressed it does not believe ""Terry to be a racist"", citing a large body of testimonial evidence -- ""including statements from black footballers"" -- to say that he is not, but that it did find him guilty of making a racist insult. Cole's initial evidence in the days after the incident occurred was amended in November 2011 when Chelsea secretary Dave Barnard asked the FA to add the word ""black"" to the former Arsenal defender's original statement. The FA also stated that it had ""considerable doubt"" over Cole's claims he had heard Ferdinand use the word ""black"" when insulting Terry after the pair clashed, while calling Barnard's evidence ""materially defective."" It went on: ""The Commission [has] considerable doubt as to whether the request to amend paragraph 4 of Mr. Cole's statement, to include the word 'black', was based on Mr. Cole's own personal recollections, or as a result of discussions that he had had with Mr. Barnard."" Cole is also likely to face punishment from his club for the abusive tweet, with manager Roberto Di Matteo stating his player had fallen foul of Chelsea's social media policy. He told a press conference: ""If you are going to criticize football the one thing I would completely agree with is there are certain players out there, and I am not particularly picking on Ashley Cole, that forget some times that they represent an employer, industry and governing body which is the FA.""","Chelsea defender Ashley Cole is charged with misconduct by English Football Association .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For a man once accustomed to wearing banana boots, tights and a leotard -- together -- today's choice of attire is remarkably sedate. Comedian Billy Connolly takes CNN's Revealed on a tour of his home town, his beloved Glasgow, Scotland. Scottish actor and comedian Billy Connolly is wearing black jeans, a black T-shirt and a brown jacket to give CNN's ""Revealed"" a tour of his beloved hometown of Glasgow. He'd almost blend into the background if it wasn't for his wild mop of grey hair, distinctive round glasses and compulsion to chat with every passer by. ""You know he just loves an audience,"" says his long-suffering but immensely proud and supportive wife, Pamela Stephenson, an Australian comedienne-turned-psychotherapist. ""I mean it's frustrating for me because we'll be in a restaurant or we'll be on the street or something and I'm trying to get somewhere, and someone will stop him and he'll say 'Ah yes!' and he'll start telling a story, and all of a sudden they're best friends."" Billy Connolly has a lot of best friends in Glasgow. Men cross the street to shake his hand and elderly ladies stop to enquire about his health. On spying the camera, one dressed in a neat blue suit and sensible flats asks, ""you doing a wee program, son?"" ""You want to be famous?"" replies Connolly, engulfing her tiny frame in a six-foot bear hug from which she emits a muffled whoop. ""Your first screen kiss,"" he adds, planting a smacker square on her lips. She giggles as they part. ""Thanks Billy,"" she says, giving him the thumbs-up. The streets of Glasgow weren't nearly as friendly 65 years ago when the young Billy Connolly arrived with a plop on the cold linoleum floor of his parents' tenement house. He was the second of two children born to a young family that was soon to fracture. Not long after Billy's birth, his father, William Connolly, left to join the war effort in Burma. His mother, Mamie Connolly, soon tired of looking after two children on her own and walked out on both of them when Billy was barely four years old.  Watch Connolly discuss how his childhood drove him into comedy » . The children were taken in by two aunts who abused them even after their father's return from the war in March 1946. Far from protecting them, he too mentally and physically abused his young son. ""The most overwhelming thing that happens to you isn't the abuse itself, the physical side,"" Connolly tells CNN. ""It's the loss of love, there's a loss of respect happens and it's irredeemable, it can't be gotten back."" As a boy, Connolly had difficulty retaining information. He did poorly at school and left to work as an apprentice welder at the local shipyards. ""It helped me greatly. You go in as a spotty boy at 16 and you come out at 21, with an Adam's apple and your voice has broken, you are a guy, a man."" By then, he'd also discovered the banjo. ""When I saw Pete Seeger playing the banjo it completely changed my life,"" Connolly tells CNN. He discovered his comedic talents while playing a folk music gig in Paisley with his friend Jimmy Steel. Halfway through a song, Connolly forgot the lyrics so he told the audience the storyline instead. To his great surprise, they laughed and a comedian was born. ""It gave me the confidence to be funny,"" Connolly recalls. ""I'd always enjoyed being funny but it gave me the confidence to stand up on stage and do it."" ""Though I must say, I really wanted to be a banjo hero, a folkie with a beard and an instrument and music, and people go 'did you hear him play?' It's purely mine now -- it isn't for the public anymore, it's just for me and my other pals who play.""  Watch a rare performance of Billy on Banjo ». In the early 1970s, Billy Connolly's anecdote-heavy, expletive-strewn stand-up shows were selling out venues in Scotland. In 1975, he hit the big time after shocking audiences with a bawdy joke on popular English talk show ""Parkinson."" ""I told a joke about a guy parking a bicycle in a woman's bum, and it got the most phenomenal reception. Parkinson just collapsed,"" Connolly recalls.  Watch Billy's bum joke » . ""He literally told one joke on that show and that made him as a comedian,"" presenter Michael Parkinson tells CNN. ""Whenever he came on the show after that, he used to put two to three million on the viewing figures. The only two people who ever did that were Mohammad Ali and Billy Connolly."" While Billy Connolly's career was on an upward trajectory, though, his personal life was spiraling out of control in a toxic blur of drink and drugs. ""I was quite suicidal at the time,"" he tells CNN. ""The fame was getting on my nerves. I was really fed up of being famous. I found it tiresome; the drinking was a way out of it, but then it became its own problem."" His first marriage was crumbling when he met wife Pamela Stephenson. ""It was like a door opening and daylight streaming in,"" he says. ""Billy will sometimes say things like I saved him. It's just not true, he saved himself,"" Stephenson tells CNN. Pamela Stephenson talks about life with Billy . ""He's very, very smart,"" she continues. ""He saw that there was a chance for personal happiness and a chance to survive and to take care of his enormous talent and move into a far greater happiness and he made a choice to do that."" More than thirty years after his sell-out Scottish shows, he's still packing them in. His recent tour of Northern Ireland sold out in record time -- 20,000 seats in six minutes. ""It's just a case of putting the name up and they come,"" promoter Pat Egan tells CNN. Connolly's manager of some 24 years, Steven Brown, still struggles to comprehend his client's enduring appeal. ""We haven't been to Ireland for seven years, and the demand is probably twice what it was before, which is probably twice what it was the tour before that,"" Brown tells CNN. ""After forty years it shouldn't do that. It should level off to a plateau, or start dipping. ""The only thing I can put it down to is he doesn't do a lot of press, he doesn't do radio. I wish I could take credit for it and say it was a clever management decision that made it happen but it's not, it's just that what he does he does brilliantly and people love it and they just want to come and see more of it."" The banana boots Connolly used to wear on stage to ""sex up"" his image now sit in a glass cabinet at the local museum, ""The People's Palace,"" in Glasgow. He no longer wears outlandish costumes on stage. He doesn't need to. If the reception he receives on the streets of his hometown is anything to go by, he'll have them rolling in the aisles for some time to come.","Comedian Billy Connolly gives CNN's Revealed a tour of his hometown .

"(CNN) -- Adam Scott will take a four-stroke lead into the final round of the Open Championship at Royal Lytham & St Annes after shooting a two-under par 68 on Saturday. The 32-year-old finished on 11-under par, four clear of overnight leader Brandt Snedeker, who struggled to a 73 and Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell (67) with Tiger Woods lurking a shot further back on six-under par. In benign conditions on the Lancashire coast, Scott put together a composed round, picking up two birdies on the opening nine before bagging another at the par-five 11th. A bogey at the 13th checked his progress but the Australian, who is bidding to win his first major championship, came home in even par -- aided by a stunning bunker shot at the 17th. ""A four shot lead doesn't seem to be very much this year on any golf tournament that I've watched. That doesn't mean a lot,"" Scott said. ""The good part is if I play a solid round of golf tomorrow, it will be very hard for the others to beat me, and that's all I'm thinking about,"" he added. Snedeker, who hadn't dropped a shot in the opening 36 holes, saw shots slip away in a hurry on Saturday, arriving at the turn three-over par for his round. Further shots went at the 11th and 14th before two birdies in the closing three holes dragged the 31-year-old back into contention. Woods who is bidding to win a 15th major title, recovered from a bogey, par, bogey start to finish with an even-par 70. ""I turned it around. I got off to an awful start and battled back and got myself right back in the mix again going into tomorrow, and I'm right there,"" Woods said. ""I'm five back. So Adam is in a great spot right now, he's got a four shot lead and he's playing really well. He's going for his first major title. So he's in a very good spot,"" the 14-time major champion said. America's Zach Johnson's round of 66 was the lowest of the day and lifted him to joint fifth alongside South Africa's Ernie Els (68) on five-under par, while 22-year-old Dane, Thorbjorn Olesen is four-under after a one-over 71. Reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson is currently locked in a three-way tie for 10th place with former Open winner's Louis Oosthuizen and Mark Calcavecchia on two-under par. World number one Luke Donald is a shot further back after a one-over par 71. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy continued his stuttering form of late, carding a three-over 73 to leave him tied for 64th on five-over par while Scotland's Martin Laird had a day to forget.

"Washington (CNN) -- Come the first Tuesday in November, when millions are streaming into polling stations across the country, as much as 40% of Americans will have already voted. In 2004, 22% of Americans voted early and that rate rose to 34% in 2008, according to Paul Gronke, Professor of Political Science who founded and runs the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Oregon. Not only is early voting changing the way Americans cast their ballot but it's also changing the way candidates run their campaigns. ""People find it much easier if they can choose the time to vote ... rather than show up on one day of the week,"" said Tom Slockett, Johnson County, Iowa, commissioner of elections and the county's voting auditor. Slockett said early voting is insurance against the expected -- finals at the University of Iowa or an out-of-town business trip -- or the unexpected, like a sick child. Johnson County, home to 130,000 residents, is on pace with its 2008 early voting requests by mail when about 55% of the county voted early. Iowa begins early voting on September 27, almost a week before the first debate on October 3. Idaho and South Dakota are the first states to start voting with ballots being cast on Friday. Depending on state law, early voting can either be done in-person, through the mail or through an absentee ballot. Some states require an excuse for absentee voting while others are moving toward no-excuse absentee balloting. Military personnel are able to vote by email. While early voting has changed the times when voters hit the polls, it has also changed the cycle by which campaigns try to influence voters. Voting days are upon us . The October Surprise -- ""the really stinky piece of information that campaigns hold on to until the end of the election,"" as Michael McDonald, an associate professor at George Mason University who specializes in American elections, puts it -- will have to be a September Surprise to have much effect. By October, he said, it could be too late for that kind of information to influence the election. And Karl Rove's successful 72-hour voter turnout program from 2002 and 2004, which used a grassroots network to push voters to the polls three days before Election Day, would come too late now. ""[Early voting has] changed our voter contact program,"" said Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. ""We're actually moving from our identification phase into our early vote, absentee ballot program earlier. That means every -- direct mail advertising -- everything moves up depending where [the state is] on the calendar."" Some Romney backers still frustrated with state of campaign . Democrats say they are using early voting to combat the large influx of super PAC dollars in this election, of which Republicans have raised more. ""While Mitt Romney and his allies are counting on big ad buys ... we've made early investments in battleground states -- where we've been registering folks and keeping an open conversation going with undecided voters for months -- to build an historic grassroots organization that will pay off when the votes are counted,"" Obama campaign spokesman Adam Fetcher said. And campaigns can better focus those efforts on who hasn't voted ahead of Election Day. ""By encouraging our supporters to vote early, we can focus our resources more efficiently on Election Day to make sure those less likely to vote get out to the polls,"" said Fetcher. And once voters cast their ballots, campaigns may contact them again to volunteer, helping with the turnout effort in the last days of the election campaign. Despite Obama cash haul, GOP sees big month over Dems . While voters are taking advantage of early voting more and more, the impact on turnout is mixed and can cost governments more. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which begins voting on October 8, Eric Sample, spokesman for the county elections division, says that early voting and the state's 100% vote-by-mail has increased voter participation. ""It does increase voter participation, especially in special elections,"" Sample said. He noted the impact, for instance, on school district elections, which aren't as high profile as presidential contests. In Colorado, which relies heavily on ballots mailed to people on an active voter roster, their system increases voting among people already on the list. But ""it doesn't get any new faces out to vote,"" said Andrew Cole, spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state. Colorado will begin its early voting in October 22. Jennie Bowser of the National Conference of State Legislatures said the impact on turnout depends on who you ask. ""The consensus seems to be ... that it's not increasing voter turnout,"" said Bowser. ""The people that vote already are also using early voting."" Obama holds advantage in three swing states . And it's not cutting costs. Slockett said early voting increases the cost of elections, noting that expenses are spread out over a longer time period. Early voting requires states to staff polling locations for weeks at a time and to maintain and secure the polling machines. ""All of that costs money and is logistically not simple,"" said Bowser. But oddly enough, logistics are exactly what resurrected early voting from its pre-1845 days when Congress declared, ""the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November"" as Election Day. Modern early voting began in the West, which has a history of complicated ballots, Gronke said. ""[Because of the initiatives and referenda] you could have a really long ballot and it would take 10, 12, 15 minutes to type it all in and make sure it's correct,"" said Cole. ""For a while there, it was just a matter of getting people out of the door [of the polling stations]."" The time-consuming voting overwhelmed polling centers on Election Day and left legislators looking for relief. Sending out mail ballots early not only allowed Colorado voters to read through the sometimes lengthy ballots and send them back at their leisure, Cole said. It also took pressure off swamped polling centers. But mail ballots can increase the chance of ballots not being counted if voters don't follow procedures carefully. Improperly filling out a ballot is ""the number one way people disenfranchise themselves,"" McDonald said. In 2008, more than 400,000 absentee ballots were thrown out nationwide, according to data from the Election Administration and Voting Survey. Even though that's less than 1% of the ballots cast nationwide, McDonald said that ""it could make a big difference in the election. So it's critical.""","In 2004, 22% of Americans voted early and that rate rose to 34% in 2008 .

"Washington (CNN) -- For at least three undecided voters, both candidates left an impression during Wednesday's debate. Mitt Romney, they said, came to play. Barack Obama, they said, let them down. Until late on October 3, Micheal Fazio, 41, of Las Vegas, leaned toward the president. But Obama's ""disinterested"" performance in the debate in Denver left him concerned. Fazio said Obama wasn't on point. ""As the president of the United States, I hate to say it, no rest for the weary,"" said Fazio, who voted for Obama in 2008. ""If he's not sharp in the debate ... what's he going to be like behind closed doors?"" Chuck Taylor, 66, a North Carolina retiree, said Romney impressed him. ""I was impressed, as many people were with Mr. Romney's debating skills,"" Taylor said. ""I thought the president for whatever reason was not on his game."" But polls show Fazio and Taylor aren't alone in their assessment of the candidates' performances. Unemployment rate below 8% a boon for Obama, but Romney says not enough . According to a CNN/ORC International survey taken just after the debate, 67% of registered voters who watched the debate said that the Romney won the contest. One in four said Obama won the 90-minute event. ""No presidential candidate has topped 60% in that question since it was first asked in 1984,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. With the candidates neck-and-neck in national polls ahead of the debate, any edge is valuable, especially with undecided voters who make up somewhere between 3% and 8% of the electorate. ""They're important because with voters on both sides seemingly unwilling to switch teams,"" David Di Martino, a Democratic strategist and partner at Blue Engine Media, said, ""these last undecided voters -- let's call them the ""6%"", will put either candidate over the top whenever they decide to break one way or the other."" A battleground poll of likely North Carolina voters taken ahead of the debate shows Obama leading Romney by two points with six percent undecided in the state. A similar poll in battleground state, Nevada shows Obama leading Romney by two points with three percent of likely voters undecided. Polling for undecided voters post-debate is not available. But will the candidates' performances make a difference in the election? Fazio says it kept his vote up for grabs. ""I've been undecided for the longest time,"" Fazio said. ""For the past month to six weeks I've been leaning toward Obama."" Fazio said he was looking for Obama to nail down his vote during the debate. Obama, Fazio said, didn't deliver. In the final days of campaign, it's all about the slivers of voters . Another undecided voter, Jason Mencher, 26, a Hofstra University law student, voted for Obama in 2008. The New York resident said ahead of the debate that he was completely neutral, but the candidates' face off pushed him toward Romney. ""I'm not happy with what Obama did in the past four years,"" Mencher said. ""I think Romney is a viable alternative, but I don't know what he would do specifically."" But he said nothing in the debate would have changed his mind ""besides some extreme event like a major meltdown"" by either candidate. In the history of televised presidential debates, only two have shifted the tide of an election -- 1960 and 2000, according to a Gallup Politics analysis. Those elections, Gallup explains, were close -- like the election this year. Wednesday's debate impacted voters but it isn't likely to alter the tide. The debate ""kept both of them squarely tied, so it didn't sway the campaign either way,"" said Christine Riordan, dean of the Daniels College of Business at the University of Denver, site of the debate. Instead, voters say they are looking toward the next three debates -- two presidential and one vice presidential -- to make a decision and to clear up their concerns. Fazio says that he is worried Romney will revert to the policies of George W. Bush. ""It scares me to stick the Republicans back in there."" Fazio said. He also added that at this point in the election, he's watching out for mistakes -- because consistency matters. ""I hate saying this ... but I am waiting for a gaffe from one of them to say, 'Oh my goodness, this is the straw that broke the camel's back.'"" Taylor is looking for someone who can corral Congress. ""I think that the president, while it's an important position, is not the problem here. It's the Congress that's the problem,"" Taylor said. ""And you've got to have a leader who is going to be able to abandon their extreme ideas and come together on a compromise on those positions, for instance, the national debt."" That was fast: Romney debate remarks in new Obama ad . Mencher wants fewer anecdotal stories, negative political sparring, and more logic and facts. ""The person who is going to lead the free world is making low blows on stage?"" Mencher asked. ""That would lose my vote."" And what comes up in the next round of debates could be significant. ""The second and the third debate become more critical in the minds of the undecided voters,"" Riordan said. Those debates could bring up some of the more ""volatile"" issues that weren't talked about Wednesday night, she said. ""There weren't any social issues introduced,"" which affect important voting blocs of women and Hispanics in swing states like Colorado, Riordan said. Undecided voters who tend to vote wait until the last minute to cast their ballots, said Jan Leighley, professor of government at American University. ""If you don't have to buy a new cell phone for another month, you probably won't buy it today,"" Leighley said. But for Fazio, because of the debate, he says he couldn't vote today. ""If you had me pencil in a vote today, I couldn't tell you who I was going to vote for.""

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Mirna Castaneda pays close attention to the instructor showing her the best way to make a bed. ""This crest is very important"" said the instructor in Spanish as Castaneda makes a double fold on the upper edge of the white bedsheets, then carefully tops it with a few pillows. It's not as if Castaneda doesn't know how to make a bed that a Las Vegas visitor can gleefully climb into after a day --- or night -- out on the town. She has already spent five years working at different hotels, but this training is required for her new job this time as a member of the Culinary Workers Union. ""They offer really good benefits I didn't have before and the pay is also better,"" she said. Her training takes place at the union's Culinary Training Academy, where job seekers learn everything needed to work on the Strip, from loading a dishwasher to vacuuming floors and waiting tables to the finer details of gourmet cooking. It also provides the experience required by the hotels and casinos. Completion of the course at the academy is the equivalent of one year of experience on the job. Why Nevada's Latino vote could make the difference in the 2012 election . That makes all the difference in the world for people like Jazmin Rivera, 21, who is hoping to land a job as a busboy. She says she has had a hard time finding a job since her employment as a census worker ended last year. But for Castaneda and Rivera, their union membership could provide more than a steady job with benefits. They could be getting a political education, too. ""We spend almost a full year before the election making sure all of our members are registered to vote,"" said Yvanna Cancela, the political director for the Culinary Workers Union Local 226. Cancela said the union also encourages and assists in navigating the citizenship process for members who qualify. That is a big deal for the Latino members of the union, who according to Cancela make up more than 35% of the Las Vegas membership. As it did in most states, the Hispanic population exploded in Nevada over the past decade. According to the census, 26% of the more than 2.7 million state residents have Latino heritage. Both parties rolling the dice in Nevada . With the strength in numbers comes political muscle. State politicians are locked in a battle to draw new congressional districts that best reflect Latino representation. Democrats favor spreading Hispanics into three districts, arguing that would give them more clout in more places. Republicans, led by Gov. Brian Sandoval, want a Hispanic majority district, saying the time has come for Latinos to have a better chance of sending one of their own to represent them in Washington. The process is now in the hands of a three-person panel appointed by a federal judge and charged with solving the stalemate. Latinos are already making their mark in politics. They are credited with saving the seat of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, in the midterm elections. They helped then-Sen. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Nevada presidential primary. Cuban-born Griselda Marino is one of those who caucused for President Obama. ""It was very interesting to participate, especially for someone like me who came from another country and had different views of the political process,"" she said. Marino joined the union 13 years ago, two years after she arrived in the United States. She said the union helped her register to vote as soon as she became a U.S. citizen. ""It is a great responsibility we all have, especially those who came from other countries, because we have to make sure our voice is also heard,"" she said. Marino said she hopes her example inspires people like Castaneda, who is more focused on getting health insurance for her family than thinking about who is running for office. ""I keep politics on the side,"" Castaneda said. Marino and the members of Local 226 will have a chance to flex their political muscle in January when Nevada holds one of the earlier caucuses in the presidential selection process. It could also be a preview of the role the Latino vote will have in November 2012.","Unions in the West play dual role for many Latinos: professional training and political activism .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A protest march against U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, led by former cricket star turned politician Imran Khan, came to a halt on Sunday when authorities blocked access to the demonstration's final destination in the tribal region, officials told CNN. Authorities used steel shipping containers and security forces to seal off the road entering South Waziristan, where protesters had planned to hold a rally on Sunday, local government official Shahid Ullah said. When confronted with the roadblock, Khan directed protesters to turn back, saying the march had achieved its goal of drawing attention to the controversial U.S. drone strikes. Khan has been a fierce critic of U.S. policy in Pakistan and the use of drone strikes, calling them a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and a strategy that fuels militant anger towards Washington. ""We will not cause any trouble if the government doesn't want us to enter South Waziristan,"" Khan told reporters. ""We just want to direct the attention of the entire world to these illegal and immoral drone attacks in Waziristan that have left many innocent people dead."" In recent years Washington has sharply stepped up the use of drone attacks in Pakistan's mostly ungoverned tribal region, widely believed to be a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. U.S. officials say the drone strikes are an effective strategy against militant groups and insist civilian casualties are rare. The anti-drone march set out in a convoy of more than 100 vehicles from the capital, Islamabad, on Saturday and reached the border of South Waziristan on Sunday afternoon, where it was turned back. The U.S.-based anti-war group Code Pink was part of the procession. Throughout the journey the pink-clad peace activists regularly chanted anti-drone slogans in Pakistan's native language of Urdu. ""Stop them! Stop them! Stop the drone attacks,"" the protesters shouted in Urdu. Pakistani authorities had earlier warned that the demonstration would not be allowed to enter South Waziristan for security reasons. ""The situation in the tribal areas is comparatively good but not suitable for any gathering there,"" Tashfeen Khan, a government official, said on Saturday. Journalist Aamir Iqbal contributed to this report.","Authorities block road into South Waziristan, ending protest march .

"ACCRA, Ghana (CNN) -- Jennifer Staple runs the Unite For Sight program which started in the U.S., but has branched out into working overseas. Regarding sight as a fundamental human right that most people take for granted, the program aims to tackle a range of visual impairments that affect people across the world. Jennifer will be traveling to Ghana and then India, taking volunteers to continue the work of Unite For Sight. Keep up with her experiences in her blogs and video diaries. November 8, 2007 I have been developing and coordinating Unite For Sight's programs in Ghana from the U.S. since 2004, so it has been a great privilege to finally arrive in Ghana to meet the patient beneficiaries and the local Unite For Sight team. I have been spending much of my time with our ophthalmic team in Accra. Robert Dolo and Kartee Karloweah are ophthalmic nurses and medical staff at the Crystal Eye Clinic, which is Unite For Sight's partner in Accra. They are extraordinary people, working six days a week to provide eye care for patients living in extreme poverty, waking at dawn and working until sunset, often examining 150 patients per day. Each day that I am with Robert and Kartee in the villages, I marvel at their dedication and efficiency. Having heard stories about them from our partner ophthalmologists and visiting volunteers, I knew that I would see their greatness in action while in Accra, but personally seeing their selfless dedication and commitment to Unite For Sight was even more extraordinary than I had anticipated. Unite For Sight vision screenings are held in very remote locations, where patients have no access to eye care. Their health needs are beyond comprehension, as raw sewage often flows through the streets and running water is nonexistent. A small area is organized for the vision screening, which includes a series of screening stations. Visiting Unite For Sight volunteers and local Ghanaian translators work to register patients, identify their eye care needs and provide visual acuity screenings. Then, the patients move into a very small, dark room where Robert and Kartee are stationed to provide examination and diagnosis. They need to work in the dark so that they can see the back of each patient's eyes. Often more than 100 degrees (Fahrenheit or 37.7 Celsius) in the room, Robert and Kartee rapidly examine each patient and determine whether they need medication, eyeglasses, consultation by ophthalmologist Dr. James Clarke or surgery. If the patient needs medication or eyeglasses, they move to another station that is usually manned by local and visiting volunteers. If the patient needs surgery, Unite For Sight arranges for them to go to Crystal Eye Clinic. Living in extreme poverty, the patients can barely afford food, so they cannot afford the price of surgery, which is usually $100. Unite For Sight sponsors their surgery to insure that no one remains blind because they can't pay. Through September 2007, Unite For Sight has coordinated and funded more than 1,200 sight-restoring cataract surgeries in the Accra, Ghana region. The success of the program can largely be attributed to the remarkable work of Robert and Kartee in the villages. It has been an extraordinary privilege to meet them and to see their work making such an impact. E-mail to a friend .","Jennifer has arrived in Ghana and is spending time with the local UFS team .

"(CNN) -- A representative for Scientologist Tom Cruise on Tuesday derided an article that contends the Church of Scientology embarked on a secret project to find the actor a girlfriend following his 2001 divorce from actress Nicole Kidman. ""Vanity Fair's story is essentially a rehash of tired old lies previously run in the supermarket tabloids, quoting the same bogus 'sources,'"" said Bert Fields, Cruise's attorney. ""It's long, boring and false."" The church also weighed in, describing the October issue article by special correspondent Maureen Orth as ""hogwash."" Ex-Scientologist: Cruise was top church recruit . Vanity Fair magazine, which provided a preview of the article on its website, said Shelly Miscavige, wife of Scientology leader David Miscavige, headed an ""auditioning"" process in 2004. Actresses who were Scientologists were called in for other reasons and asked, ""What do you think of Tom Cruise?"" the article says. Actress Nazanin Boniadi was eventually selected and dated Cruise for a few months, according to the article. Boniadi met Cruise in November 2004 and sensed the possibility of an arranged marriage, according to Vanity Fair. The relationship ended in January 2005, according to the article. What is Scientology anyway? Boniadi's representative told CNN that she was not available for comment Tuesday evening. In its statement Tuesday, the Church of Scientology said, ""there was no project, secret or otherwise, ever conducted by the church to find a bride (via audition or otherwise) for any member of the church. Never. "" Vanity Fair relied on a small group of ""anti-Scientologists"" for its information, the church said. ""These apostates have shamelessly exploited Tom Cruise's divorce by spreading false and invented tabloid stories in hopes of promoting themselves."" The Church of Scientology said Orth came to the church only after the article was written. Further, it said, Boniadi is a member of the ""anti-Scientologists."" Murdoch calls Scientology 'very weird cult' The church's statement also said a member of the group, who was a source for the Vanity Fair article, previously said under oath in an unrelated matter that he was a paid tabloid source. The statement questioned whether Vanity Fair paid for his ""cooperation"" in ""corroborating"" its article. Vanity Fair denied that claim and released a brief statement when contacted by CNN for comment on the article. ""We absolutely stand by Maureen Orth's story,"" spokeswoman Beth Kseniak said. ""Vanity Fair has never paid sources and never would."" Vanity Fair said Cruise and David Miscavige had declined to be interviewed. Orth did not immediately respond to a message left Tuesday night by CNN. Cruise has two children from his marriage with the Academy Award-winning Kidman. They divorced in 2001. He later married actress Katie Holmes. They were divorced in July. More: Unpacking report that Holmes has rejoined Catholic Church .

"(CNN) -- Ryder Hesjedal became the first Canadian to win one of cycling's three major tours as he claimed victory in the Giro d'Italia Sunday. The 31-year-old Garmin rider snatched the pink jersey from Spain's Joaquim Rodriguez on the final time trial stage in Milan, forging a winning margin of just 16 seconds after 21 stages. Hesjedal had trailed Rodriguez by 31 seconds ahead of the 28.2 km individual test and sixth place behind stage winner Marco Pinotti was enough to seal his narrow win. The pair had battled through most of the latter stages of the Giro for overall victory with two grueling legs in the Alps ahead of the time trial proving decisive. Hesjedal kept close enough to Rodriguez to lay the foundations for his triumphant finale as the stronger rider against the clock. Belgian Thomas De Gendt, who rode so superbly to win Saturday's penultimate stage, was rewarded with third place on the podium, one minute 39 seconds behind the winner. For home riders it has proved a difficult Giro, with last year's winner Michele Scarponi in fourth and Ivan Basso fifth. It was the first time since 1995 that no Italian riders had made the final podium. Small consolation came in the form of Pinotti's commanding final day victory, finishing 39 seconds clear of Britain's Geraint Thomas (Sky) with Jesse Sergent of New Zealand third. The Giro d'Italia is the first of the three major tours to take place, with the Tour de France starting in July ahead of the Tour of Spain in September.","Garmin rider Ryder Hesjedal wins Giro d'Italia in Milan .

"(CNN) -- You could say there is only one swing state that really matters in 2012: Germany. Whether (and how and when) Germany acts to save the euro will exert huge influence over the U.S. economy, too, and thus over the outcome of the presidential election. Next question: How much influence? Everybody agrees that the troubles in the eurozone hurt the U.S. economy. When your trading partners slump, you slump with them. Everybody agrees that the uncertainty over the future of the euro currency worries U.S. financial markets. If the currency fails, European banks plunge into a crisis that would be a replay of the shock of 2008. But what remains deeply uncertain is the upside of the equation: How much benefit would the U.S. gain, if Europe did somehow find a solution to the euro problem? It's clear that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has the power by saying ""no"" to lose the presidency for Barack Obama. Could she win it for him with a ""yes""? By the trade numbers, faster growth in Europe would seem relatively unimportant to the U.S. economy. Trade accounts for only about a quarter of the U.S. economy, and trade with the entire European Union represents less than a fifth of that one-fifth. Now remember that the European Union includes a number of important countries, such as the United Kingdom, that do not use the euro. And the largest economy in the eurozone, Germany, continues to buy and sell strongly. A fillip to the economies of Spain, Italy and France would be welcome news but hardly decisive to a U.S. economy still recovering from its own financial crisis. Yet trade numbers may understate the story. Here in the U.S., the raw materials for recovery are all at hand. U.S. corporations are earning record profits. They have accumulated vast reserves of cash. They are investing, and they have begun to hire, too. As Obama likes to note, more people are at work today in the U.S. private sector than on the day he took office. (He does not add that far fewer were at work when the recession began in December 2007.) In aggregate, though, the pace of recovery continues weak. The rocket is lifting off, but it is not achieving escape velocity. Something more is needed! The program needed to save the euro could provide a piece of that ""something."" To save the euro, Germany will have to agree not only to a financial rescue of other countries' banks but to a big program to stimulate the German economy, still one of the world's top five. Somebody has to buy, and with China and India slowing down, Germany -- a much richer country -- would emerge as what the U.S. was in the early 2000s: the world's consumer of last resort. Over the horizon, we can see the dawn of the next great chapter of U.S. economic expansion: the conversion from coal-fired electricity to a new energy economy based on the exploitation of the vast quantities of natural gas entrapped in U.S. shale formations. Gas emits only about half as much carbon dioxide per unit of energy as coal, so it is more environmentally benign as well as cheap. The conversion process will be a vast undertaking, putting money and people to work. To close the gap from here to there, though, the U.S. needs a jolt. Could a euro rescue administer it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Whether Germany saves the euro is key to 2012 U.S. election .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate U.S. prohibitions against torture unless they ""have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering,"" according to a previously secret Justice Department memo released Thursday. Former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft testifies before Congress July 17 about waterboarding. The interrogator's ""good faith"" and ""honest belief"" that the interrogation will not cause such suffering protects the interrogator, the memo adds. ""Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture,"" Jay Bybee, then the assistant attorney general, wrote in the memo. The 18-page memo is heavily redacted, with 10 of its 18 pages completely blacked out and only a few paragraphs legible on the others. Another memo released Thursday advises that ""the waterboard,"" or simulated drowning, does ""not violate the Torture Statute."" It also cites a number of warnings against torture, including statements by President Bush and a then-new Supreme Court ruling ""which raises possible concerns about future U.S. judicial review of the [interrogation] Program."" A third memo instructs interrogators to keep records of sessions in which ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" are used. The memo is signed by then-CIA director George Tenet and dated January 28, 2003. The memos were made public by the American Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the three CIA-related documents under Freedom of Information Act requests. ""These documents supply further evidence, if any were needed, that the Justice Department authorized the CIA to torture prisoners in its custody,"" said Jameel Jaffer, director of the ACLU National Security Project. The Bush administration has consistently denied that the United States tortures detainees. Reports say the CIA waterboarded three ""high-value detainees,"" including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, although former Justice Department official Daniel Levin suggested in congressional testimony in June that there had been more than three instances of the practice, which critics call torture. The third document released Thursday was blacked out except for a line saying ""Unless otherwise approved by Headquarters, CIA officers (redacted) may use only Permissible Interrogation Techniques. Permissible Interrogation Techniques consist of both (a) Standard Techniques and (b) Enhanced Techniques,"" plus the instruction for interrogators to keep records of sessions in which enhanced interrogation techniques are used.","Previously secret Justice Department memo released Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Investigators were searching for suspects Wednesday after a shooting that killed one Border Patrol agent and wounded another near the U.S.-Mexican border in Arizona. The agents came under fire near Naco, Arizona, Tuesday after responding to a sensor that had gone off near the border, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said. Authorities identified the agent killed as 30-year-old Nicholas Ivie. A native of Provo, Utah, he joined the Border Patrol in January 2008. Ivie is survived by his wife and two young children. ""I'm just in shock right now and sad,"" sister-in-law Michelle Ivie told CNN affiliate KUTV. ""Nick was the most tenderhearted, kind, gentle, loving person you could ever meet."" He was the youngest of five children, KUTV reported. In a statement, his parents and brothers said: ""We are extremely proud of Nick and for his service both in his community and our country. He loved what he did and he gave it his all, including his life. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wonderful wife and his two beautiful girls."" President Barack Obama called Ivie's family to offer his condolences and thank the family for Ivie's service, the White House said. ""The president told the family they are in his thoughts and prayers and made clear that his administration was doing everything it could to locate those responsible for this tragic event,"" a White House statement said. The agent who was wounded was not identified. After the shooting, he was airlifted to an area hospital and with non-life-threatening injuries. He was released from the hospital Wednesday, said Jeremy Copeland, an agent with the Tucson Sector of U.S. Border Patrol. Customs and Border Protection ""appreciates the support it has received from its law enforcement partners and community members from around the nation,"" Copeland added. Tuesday, Customs and Border Protection Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar noted that Ivie ""died in the line of duty, protecting our nation against those who threaten our way of life. ""His death only strengthens our resolve to enforce the rule of law and bring those responsible to justice,"" Aguilar said in a statement. The FBI is conducting a joint investigation with the Cochise County Sheriff's Office. Investigators have not yet found the weapon used in the shooting, a law enforcement official said. James Turgal, special agent in charge of the FBI for the Phoenix division, declined to say whether the agents involved in the incident returned fire. He also declined to comment on whether any weapons had been found. Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, said investigators are at the scene. ""Every time that a law enforcement person is either killed or shot or injured in the line of duty, we have to take a moment and think of our families and think of the heroes involved,"" Breuer said. Ivie is the 14th agent killed in the line of duty since 2008, including three this year. He was killed near a border station recently named for Brian Terry, whose 2010 death led to the public disclosure of the botched Fast and Furious gun-smuggling sting, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. ""There's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed, but because of Operation Fast and Furious, we'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill-advised gunwalking strategy sanctioned by the federal government. It's a sad commentary,"" the Republican senator said. Turgal declined to comment on whether there could be a possible Fast and Furious connection to Tuesday's killing.

"GONAIVES, Haiti (CNN) -- Four major storms have raked the desperately poor country of Haiti in the past month, leaving at least 341 people dead. A man carries drinking water through the flooded streets of Gonaives, Haiti, on Monday. Nine of the deaths were attributed to Fay, 79 to Gustav, 183 to Hanna and 70 to Ike, said Abel Nazaire, deputy head of Haiti's Civil Protection Service. The country's fragile infrastructure was overloaded after the storms and officials were concerned that the floodwaters could spread disease, Sophie Boutaud de la Combe, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, said Tuesday. Gonaives, on the west coast, is one of the hardest-hit cities. This week, Gonaives was knee-deep in filthy water and reachable only by water or air, with many of Haiti's bridges destroyed and roads flooded. ""My home is destroyed. I have no place to live with my kids. Everything I had just washed away,"" Roselene Josef told CNN.  Watch desperate survivors in Gonaives » . Another survivor said, ""The flood washed away everything. I couldn't save anything. They should just move this city. Floods always destroy it."" Aid workers warned of a deepening humanitarian crisis as attempts to deliver aid were frustrated by logistical problems. The U.S. Navy's USS Kearsarge arrived in the waters off Haiti on Monday to support the U.S. Agency for International Development's efforts to assist after the devastation. The vessel will help move cargo and equipment between affected cities and will deliver relief supplies, said the U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command. But Monday, the Kearsarge wasn't able to deliver anything to Gonaives, because the ship's scout helicopters couldn't find a suitable place for supplies to be unloaded, according to The Associated Press. A U.S. Coast Guard ship carrying 35 tons of relief supplies arrived Saturday in Gonaives. The U.S. cutter was preceded by a ship carrying U.N. relief supplies, including 19 tons of high-energy biscuits, 50,000 bottles of water and water purification tablets, which arrived Friday in Gonaives, said Myrta Kaulard of the United Nations' World Food Program. CNN's Karl Penhaul watched as U.N. troops handed out scant supplies of food and water to a long line of Haitians.  The line became chaotic, with people fighting over supplies.  Watch the devastation Penhaul found in Haiti » . Hundreds of people had taken shelter in a school. They told Penhaul they had not received relief aid in a week. An official in Gonaives told the AP on Monday that nine people had died in shelters, including two children. It was not clear if they had died of starvation or some other cause, Daniel Dupiton of the region's civil protection department told the AP. When floodwaters were at their highest, some residents camped out on their roofs, their clothing and blankets hung over the sides of buildings. Some people ""have lost really everything. ... These are not rich people, these are people who were really struggling [already] against high food prices,"" Kaulard said. U.S. Navy Capt. Frank Ponds said he had flown over part of southern and northern Haiti. ""I saw towns that were completely flooded,"" Ponds said. ""I saw infrastructure, such as bridge[s] and roads, totally wiped out."" The eye of Hurricane Ike never touched Haiti earlier this week, but the storm system did bring heavy rains and winds to Gonaives and other towns. Jean Pierre Guiteau, executive director for the Red Cross in Haiti, said 52 people were killed when a river burst its banks in the mountain town of Cabaret near the capital, Port-au-Prince. Another 21 bodies were pulled from sea at Fort-Liberté, Haiti, close to the border with the Dominican Republic. ""It's a very grim picture,"" Guiteau said Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi gave her Nobel speech in Norway on Saturday, more than two decades after she won the peace prize. Her presence in Oslo, Norway, on a historic first trip to Europe after years of house arrest, signals the progress toward reform in Myanmar, also known as Burma, over the past year. Suu Kyi was unable to accept the Nobel when it was awarded in 1991 because she was under house arrest in Myanmar. Her husband and two sons accepted it then on her behalf, paying tribute to her sacrifice. Greeted by heartfelt applause from those gathered in Oslo City Hall, Suu Kyi spoke of what peace meant to her and also of her country's fragile progress toward democratic reform. ""Over the past year there have been signs that the endeavors of those who believe in democracy and human rights are beginning to bear fruit in Burma. There have been changes in a positive direction; steps towards democratization have been taken,"" she said. ""If I advocate cautious optimism it is not because I do not have faith in the future but because I do not want to encourage blind faith."" Speaking as a former prisoner of conscience, she appealed for the ""earliest, unconditional release"" of all prisoners of conscience still held in Myanmar. Of her own work for democracy, she said it had never occurred to her that it might one day lead to any award or honor. ""The prize we were working for was a free, secure and just society where our people might be able to realize their full potential. The honor lay in our endeavor. History had given us the opportunity to give of our best for a cause in which we believed,"" she said. ""When the Nobel Committee chose to honor me, the road I had chosen of my own free will became a less lonely path to follow. For this I thank the Committee, the people of Norway and peoples all over the world whose support has strengthened my faith in the common quest for peace."" Earlier in her speech, she explained how the prize at first ""did not seem quite real"" but that her understanding of it changed through her long isolation under house arrest, as she became aware of how it was being discussed in the wider world. The peace prize ""had made me real once again; it had drawn me back into the wider human community. And what was more important, the Nobel Prize had drawn the attention of the world to the struggle for democracy and human rights in Burma. We were not going to be forgotten."" She said the prize, for her, meant extending her concern for democracy and human rights beyond national borders. What Suu Kyi's moment shows us . And years later, much of the world is still seeking peace as ""negative forces"" eat away at its foundations, she said. ""Fires of suffering and strife are raging around the world. In my own country, hostilities have not ceased in the far north; to the west, communal violence resulting in arson and murder were taking place just several days before I started out on the journey that has brought me here today."" Introducing Suu Kyi, Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman ThorbjÃ¸rn Jagland paid tribute to her ""awe-inspiring tenacity, sacrifice, and firmness of principle."" He recalled how her son accepted the award on her behalf in 1991, and the challenges Suu Kyi faced during her long years of house arrest in Myanmar, during which her husband died in Britain. ""You carry a heavy burden on your shoulders. No one can be certain of what the future will bring. But today you are here. And we know for sure that you can return home,"" he said. ""Few have done more than you have to make the world a better place for all of us. We thank you for your fearlessness, your tenacity and your strength. ""You bring hope to the oppressed people across the world. Your life is a message to all of us... You have paid a high price but you have been spreading hope, and the world needs hope."" Speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour from Oslo ahead of the ceremony, Suu Kyi explained that she was still exploring the question of what peace means. ""My attitude to peace is rather based on the Burmese definition of peace -- it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world. So peace does not mean just putting an end to violence or to war, but to all other factors that threaten peace, such as discrimination, such as inequality, poverty,"" she said. Jagland: What Suu Kyi's moment shows us . While in Europe, Suu Kyi is also scheduled to address both houses of the British Parliament, be the guest of honor at a concert in Dublin, Ireland, and celebrate her 67th birthday with family. The trip is Suu Kyi's second abroad since she returned to Myanmar, also known as Burma, in 1988 to care for her dying mother, and comes on the heels of her first trip outside the country earlier this year. Suu Kyi was recently elected to parliament as her National League for Democracy won dozens of seats in by-elections. It remains a minority in parliament, but the elections marked a turning point for the country after decades of oppression by its military rulers. A military coup in September 1988 put Gen. Saw Maung in power, setting off anti-government demonstrations and a crackdown that left hundreds dead. Suu Kyi -- whose husband, Michael Aris, remained in England -- became a leading activist and co-founder of an opposition group, the National League for Democracy. She was placed under house arrest for the first time the following July on charges of trying to divide the military. She spent much of the next two decades confined to her home by the ruling junta. When her party won the 1990 general election in a landslide vote, the military rulers -- in power since 1962 -- refused to let the National League for Democracy serve, nullifying the results. A year later, Suu Kyi won the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought as well as the Nobel Peace Prize, which cited her ""nonviolent struggle for democracy and human rights."" But she remained in detention. Accepting the prize at the time on his mother's behalf, Alexander Aris said, ""I personally believe that, by her own dedication and personal sacrifice, she has come to be a worthy symbol through whom the plight of all the people of Burma may be recognized."" The military rulers have since loosened their grip on power, allowing a series of democratic reforms. Her house arrest ended in 2010, and she was able to travel around the country during her party's election campaign this year.

"(CNN) -- Thursday's vice presidential debate will not receive nearly as much attention as the battles between Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama. After all, the debates between the vice presidential candidates are a bit like watching AAA baseball. Right now, most voters are focused on the people running for the highest office in the land. Nevertheless, vice presidential debates have a colorful history. Although they don't do much to affect the results of the actual campaign, they can have an effect on the future of a candidate's career regardless of whether the ticket wins or loses. In several cases, promising stars have been badly harmed by their performances, developing public perceptions that proved hard to shake. Opinion: Romney was hungry, Obama was flat . With Vice President Joe Biden possibly considering a run for the presidency in 2016 and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan widely considered to be one of the most promising stars of the GOP, both men have a lot to lose if their effort on Thursday does not go well. In 1976, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kansas, ripped into his opponent on many fronts, but he came off looking nasty and unnecessarily aggressive. Some of his statements were so controversial that they raised questions about whether he was fit to hold the office, particularly because voters were still leery from the nastiness of President Richard Nixon's White House. During the debate Dole said that ""If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century, it would be about 1.6 million Americans, enough to fill the city of Detroit."" Walter Mondale seized on the statement, saying that ""Sen. Dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man."" That phrase stuck, even more than Dole's comments, and for many years Republicans remained skeptical that Dole could be an effective presidential candidate because of this negative image. In 1988, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, running with Michael Dukakis, picked apart Sen. Dan Quayle. The charismatic young conservative from Indiana was a fresh voice in the party, a politician who many observers thought could be a new leader for the GOP down the road. This was why Vice President George H.W. Bush selected him as his running mate. News: Stakes get higher in upcoming Biden-Ryan debate . When Quayle, who had stumbled through some gaffes early after his announcement, likened himself to President John F. Kennedy, Bentsen fired back: ""I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."" The zinger played into fears that Quayle was a lightweight who could not handle the obligations of the presidency. While Quayle was on the winning ticket, his image took a big hit as a result of the debate and other events on the campaign trail. In 2004, North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, running with Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, also suffered from his encounter with a more experienced candidate, Vice President Dick Cheney. At the time, Edwards was one of the darlings of the Democratic Party, a photogenic senator who spoke emotionally about the issues of poverty and inequality, something that energized the party's base. But his performance in the debate was unsuccessful. Opinion: Millennials want candidates Talk to us . Cheney dug into Edwards, saying, ""The first time I ever met you was when you walked onto the stage tonight,"" a statement highlighting the accusation that Edwards was more interested in advancing his career than politics and that he had constantly missed votes. When Edwards brought up Cheney's daughter Mary, who is gay, to challenge his opposition to gay marriage, Cheney came back by saying, ""Let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter,"" ending Edwards' assault on the spot. Edwards' performance left many uncomfortable. The senator looked like a lightweight, and many came away more skeptical about whether he could handle the pressures of the presidency. The 2008 debate between then-Sen. Joe Biden and Sarah Palin didn't have as many dramatic moments. Still it was harmful to Palin. The Alaska governor entered the debate with low expectations after a series of botched television interviews led voters to question whether she was really qualified to hold higher office. During the debates, Palin did not do much to impress voters. Her decision to evade certain questions and give vague responses to others continued to fuel discussion as to whether she was out of her league. What would you ask Biden, Ryan? Some scratched their head when she asked her opponent, ""Can I call you Joe?"" At another point she admitted that she ""may not answer the questions the way the moderator and you want to hear."" The performance became fodder for ""Saturday Night Live"" comedians, with Tina Fey playing Palin, constantly winking and talking about being a maverick without any substance. When the segment ends, Fey asks: ""Are we not doing the talent portion?"" (A reference to Palin having been in the Miss Alaska competition.) Opinion: Will Big Bird be downsized? It might be that following the first presidential debate, where Mitt Romney dramatically turned the media narrative in his favor and walked away with a major victory, that interest will be greater than usual in this vice presidential debate, and a decisive victory either way could play some role in the campaign. But the chances are still slim. Regardless, we do know that poor performances in vice presidential debates can harm the chances for a candidate to run for higher office down the road. Though they will obviously be focused on 2012, both Ryan and Biden will need to be careful not to act in ways that undercut their ability to run for the presidency four years from now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Vice presidential debates don't usually sway outcome of elections .

"(CNN) -- Scientists at Ohio's Cleveland Clinic are touting a new prototype vaccine to prevent breast cancer as ""promising."" This follows tests performed on mice by the researchers. The scientists said a single vaccination was shown to prevent breast cancer tumors from forming in mice, and also stymied the growth of existing tumors. The vaccine contains a protein found in most breast cancers, but not found in healthy women, except during lactation, according to Dr. Vincent Tuohy, the study's principal investigator and an immunologist at the Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute. Tuohy says this allows the vaccine to direct a woman's immune system to target this protein without damaging healthy breast tissue. ""We can protect women from breast cancer, but if it destroyed their normal breast, it's an unacceptable side-effect, so we had to avoid that,"" Tuohy said. Tuohy now wants to move forward in testing the vaccine in human patients. Enrollment could begin next year according to the Cleveland Clinic. Tuohy acknowledges cancers have been cured in mice before without that success transitioning to humans, but thinks this vaccine's chances of success are ""promising."" ""It's kind of like an application of immunologic judo, using the natural changes that occur in a woman's needs,"" said Tuohy. ""A decrease in the use of the breast for breastfeeding, and an increase in the breast's risk of developing tumors. We're taking advantage of that. That hasn't been done before."" The inspiration for the research comes from the childhood vaccination program that has been successful in preventing diseases like polio and measles, according to Tuohy. ""It just struck me as a giant hole in our health care that we don't have preventive vaccines that mimic the childhood vaccination program for adult diseases like breast cancer,"" said Tuohy. The tests have been restricted to mice so far. Tuohy said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will guide researchers through what type of toxicity studies they want done, and usually they require other species -- rats, for example. Tuohy says he doesn't anticipate any difference in results between mice and rats, but he would not second-guess the FDA on their request for tests on different species. The FDA has granted approval to two cancer-prevention vaccines: cervical and liver cancer. However, these vaccines target viruses, while the one tested by the Cleveland Clinic targets cancer formation. If any human testing proves successful, the strategy would be to vaccinate women 40 and over as well as younger women with a heightened risk of breast cancer. Tuohy says there is no funding for human trials at this point, but it has been applied for. However, he speculates it will take at least 10 years to get the vaccine to normal, healthy women at risk of developing the cancer. ""We have to try it. It looks to me to be extremely promising, and until I see a better idea I'd like to try this.""","Scientists at Ohio's Cleveland Clinic tout prototype vaccine to prevent breast cancer .

"(CNN) -- A controversial new cyberlaw has been temporarily suspended in the Philippines by the country's top court Tuesday, a move seen as a victory of netizens who objected to the criminalization of libel, which could result in social media users being thrown in jail for posts. The Supreme Court suspended the new law for 120 days effective immediately, giving the government time to amend the law. Fifteen petitions -- signed by hundreds of individuals and several organizations -- were filed opposing the law. Petitioners said the law has a ""repressive perspective on personal freedoms and regressive view of technology."" The top court's order has given respondents 10 days to comment on the petitions filed and has set January 15 to hear oral arguments in the case.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Maria Shriver and her children are ""circling the wagons and are working through"" the family crisis brought on by the revelation that Arnold Schwarzenegger fathered a child more than 10 years ago outside his marriage, a source close to Shriver told CNN Tuesday. The former California governor is ""way on the outside of the circle"" and ""rambling around"" their huge house with none of his family around, said the source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The revelation, published first by the Los Angeles Times, came about a week after Schwarzenegger and his wife of 25 years announced that they were ""amicably separating."" ""After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,"" Schwarzenegger said in a statement obtained by CNN. ""I understand and deserve the feelings of anger and disappointment among my friends and family. There are no excuses and I take full responsibility for the hurt I have caused. I have apologized to Maria, my children and my family. I am truly sorry."" Schwarzenegger fathered the child with a household staffer, the Times article said. He has provided support for the child since birth, the source told CNN. First published by the Los Angeles Times . The staffer told the newspaper that the child was fathered by her then-husband. She declined to comment after learning of Schwarzenegger's statement, the newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted her as saying she recently retired ""on good terms"" with the couple after working for them for 20 years. The newspaper said it was not publishing the former staffer's name or that of her child to protect their privacy. Schwarzenegger's four children were told about their sibling only recently, with Shriver ""methodically"" talking to them, the source said. They were ""well prepared"" before it became public, the source said. Patrick, Schwarzenegger's 17-year-old son, expressed his feelings Tuesday morning in a Twitter posting: . ""some days you feel like s--t, some days you want to quit and just be normal for a bit, yet i love my family till death do us apart. #family"" The oldest child, 21-year-old Katherine, followed with her own tweet later Tuesday: . ""This is definitely not easy but I appreciate your love and support as i begin to heal and move forward in life. I will always love my family!"" Shriver, who described her husband as an ""A-plus human being"" when he was accused of sexual misconduct in 2003, released a written statement Tuesday calling it ""a painful and heartbreaking time."" ""As a mother, my concern is for the children,"" Shriver said. ""I ask for compassion, respect and privacy as my children and I try to rebuild our lives and heal. I will have no further comment."" People: 'I love my family,' Patrick Schwarzenegger says . Privately with her children, ""Maria is very much 'Don't abandon your father,' "" the source said ""It is very admirable to not show your children the anger and also ask your children to be supportive of their father."" The announcement on May 9 that Schwarzenegger and Shriver were separating did not mention a reason for the split, but said the decision was a mutual one. ""This has been a time of great personal and professional transition for each of us,"" they said. ""After a great deal of thought, reflection, discussion, and prayer, we came to this decision together."" The couple have four children together between the ages of 13 and 21. After Schwarzenegger and Shriver married in 1986, they became one of America's most famous couples. He was one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, and she was a network news anchor and a member of the Kennedy family, America's storied Democratic political dynasty. Shortly before the 2003 gubernatorial election that catapulted the former actor to political office, however, the Los Angeles Times ran a series of articles in which 16 women accused him of sexually harassing and humiliating them over a 30-year period in incidents on movie sets, at gymnasiums and elsewhere. One of the women said that when she worked with Schwarzenegger on a movie, he pulled up her shirt to expose her breasts and took a picture, and groped her on two other occasions. Rhonda Miller filed a lawsuit, saying Schwarzenegger and his campaign staff tried to discredit her by spreading false information about her. Schwarzenegger said he knew nothing about Miller's allegations and said the timing of the complaints of the 16 women was ""rather odd,"" given that no one had filed a complaint against him in the 35 years that he had lived in the United States. Schwarzenegger issued a general apology for ""behaving badly sometimes"" but said many of the allegations were not true ""because that's not my behavior."" Shriver took to the campaign trail to defend her husband a day after the allegations surfaced and just four days before the 2003 recall election. ""You can listen to all the negativity, and you can listen to people who have never met Arnold, or who met him for five seconds 30 years ago. Or you can listen to me,"" she said in a speech to a Republican women's group in Orange County. ""I wouldn't be standing here if this man weren't an A-plus human being. I wouldn't be taking my time, I wouldn't have left my job that I love, I wouldn't be doing any of this if I didn't believe in this man."" Speaking to reporters after the speech, Shriver described her husband as ""an extraordinary man"" and took issue with the characterization that he behaves boorishly toward women. ""He's honest, he's sensitive, he's sincere. And he is gracious with every bone in his body,"" she said. ""I have met thousands and thousands of women who have come up to me and said they have worked with him, they have worked for him, alongside (him) and he has been an extraordinary gentleman."" She also said she thinks it took ""tremendous courage to stand up and say, 'I'm sorry if I offended anybody. I apologize. That was not my intention.' "" Shriver said then that she was not personally hurt by the allegations. ""Nothing hurts, because I know the man that I'm married to,"" she said. ""Has he said and done everything absolutely (right) 100% of the time? No. But I don't know anybody on the planet, male or female, who's led a perfect life. ""I think it's really important to understand who Arnold is today, and I think it's taken great courage on his part to get into this race."" Schwarzenegger, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Austria who gained fame as the youngest winner of the Mr. Universe bodybuilding contest, was governor until January. He has been busy in recent months reviving his acting career and signing movie deals -- including a project to do another installment of his ""Terminator"" series.","NEW: Maria Shriver's ""circling the wagons,"" a source says .

"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (CNN)  -- At least 50 people have died in a school collapse in in Petionville, near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, officials said Friday night. Haitians try to help victims at a school that collapsed Friday in Petionville, near Port-au-Prince. Rescue personnel planned to continue working into the night to dig out students and teachers buried in the rubble, the Red Cross said. At least 100 people have been injured, the Haitian Civil Protection Bureau said. The death toll is expected to rise. Officials said the school could have held as many as 700 people when the collapse occurred at 10 a.m. (10 a.m. ET) Some students were in class while others were in a playground, Haitian media reported. ""We are looking at major casualties here,"" Claudon said. He said dozens of students appeared to be trapped inside but couldn't give an exact number. However, he said it was a typical school day and the building had been crowded. Most of the students at the College La Promesse Evangelique range in age from 10 to 20, he said, but there are younger ones as well. Haitian press reports said the school has kindergarten, primary and secondary students. President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis toured the disaster area. ""I heard and saw with my own eyes children appealing for help,"" Preval was quoted as saying on the French language www.haitipressnetwork.com. ""We are taking all necessary steps,"" Pierre-Louis said. "" The government has mobilized to save those who can be saved."" Preval asked residents to stay away from the area so police and rescue officials could do their work unimpeded. Michaele Gedeon, president of Haiti's Red Cross, said she heard the voices of distraught children as rescuers tried to calm them while she was on the phone attempting to coordinate emergency rescue efforts.  Watch as the Red Cross official describes the scene » . ""On the phone, you can hear so many children, you know, crying, crying and saying, 'this one is dead,' 'that one is dead,' "" she said. Claudon said hundreds of bystanders and rescue workers were digging through the rubble, but ""what we need right now is heavy search-and-rescue equipment."" Claudon later said, ""local authorities are doing their best."" Fifty to 60 patients, 30 of them severely injured, were taken to Trinite Hospital in Port-au-Prince, said Isabelle Mouniaman Nara, the head of mission in the capital for Medecins sans Frontieres. Another 150 patients were treated elsewhere, Nara said Friday night. The situation at Trinite ""is under control right now,"" she said. Trinite is the only hospital open in Port-au-Prince, the group said. The other two, General Hospital and Hospital de la Paix, are closed by strikes. The school is in an extremely poor part of town, and the roads are nearly impassable, local journalist Clarens Renois said. A United Nations helicopter was unable to land, Renois said. ""The school is poorly built,"" said Amelia Shaw, a journalist with United Nations TV who visited the scene. Renois described the building as ""not quite solid"" with ""weak construction."" The school consisted of two floors with an addition built in the rear over a 200-foot ravine, Shaw said. The steep hillside, she said, is covered with shanty-like housing on both sides. The disaster occurred when the second floor crumbled onto the first, Shaw said. A disaster assistance response team from the U.S. Agency for International Development arrived on the scene within hours of the collapse, the agency said in a release. After assessing the situation, USAID activated its partner the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team. That team will be composed of 38 personnel, four search-and-rescue dogs and 31,000 pounds of rescue equipment and is expected to arrive Saturday. The Urban Search and Rescue Team will be accompanied by four additional USAID disaster experts. U.S. Ambassador Janet Sanderson expressed her condolences, haitipressnetwork.com reported.","NEW: At least 50 students killed, 100 injured; toll is expected to rise .

Peter Siddle (34) and Brad Haddin (21) steered the hosts home after they stumbled from a comfortable position of 205-3, losing three wickets for just 18 balls in the process. The biggest talking point, in front of a huge Boxing Day crowd at the MCG, was the dismissal of senior batsman Michael Hussey -- who has been under pressure recently following a string of poor scores. 2011 - The sporting year in pictures . Hussey suffered his third first-ball duck in eight innings after being caught behind off a Zaheer Khan delivery. TV replays appeared to show that the ball brushed Hussey's sleeve rather than his bat, but India opted to reject the Decision Review System (DRS) for this four-Test series -- meaning Australia could not appeal against the dismissal. Australia got off to a sticky start, losing their opening two wickets before 50 runs were on the board. However, former captain Ricky Ponting (62) and debutant opener Ed Cowan (68) shared a century stand for the third wicket, before Ponting was caught at second slip as he continues his near two-year wait for a Test hundred. India are bidding to win their first series in Australia in 64 years and currently hold the Border-Gavaskar trophy after winning the last two series at home.

"(CNN) -- This week the Democratic National Convention isn't running away from the abortion issue. Almost all of Tuesday night's speakers made some reference to reproductive freedom, from Nancy Keenan of NARAL to Michelle Obama. So confidently and constantly was it mentioned that it became something of a litany. Deval Patrick is for it, Martin O'Malley wants it passionately, Julian Castro sees it as a fundamental right. In case you missed it, the Democrats really, really believe in reproductive freedom. The electoral message is that Mitt Romney and the Republicans are waging a war on women, or at least a concerted effort to limit access to contraception and abortion. The goal is to expand the gender voting gap to the Democratic Party's advantage. And also to turn out the base -- reviving the liberal coalition that put Barack Obama in office in 2008 . By contrast, Romney seems to be avoiding abortion talk as much as possible. He mentioned it only once in his convention speech, and the ticket has been beset by rumors of flipping and U-turning on the issue. No one doubts that the GOP is as anti-abortion as ever, but it seems to regard the matter as a distraction from this election's central issue -- jobs. Historically, this finds us in a very unusual situation. It used to be Republicans who used abortion as a wedge issue against Democrats. Now it's the other way around. For more than 30 years, Republicans used abortion partly from conviction, partly to win religious voters and partly just to keep the Democrats on a back foot, forcing them constantly to equivocate in a manner that made them seem muddled or the prisoner of the feminist lobby. When they ran for the White House in 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore had both ""evolved"" on the issue so dramatically or cynically that even the spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee described the position as ""pretty slippery."" In office, Clinton stuck to a formula of ""safe, legal and rare"" that seemed to acknowledge that abortion was something troubling that ought to be reduced. His wife went further. When she was setting herself up for a presidential run, Hillary Clinton described abortion as a ""sad, even tragic choice"" that she hoped would ""not ever have to be exercised."" Yet neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton lobbied for legal limits that would reduce the number of procedures significantly. Until recently the Democratic message has been that abortion is almost too complex for a definitive stance. Recall the painful contortions that John Kerry went through in 2004, trying to explain how a faithful Catholic could regard abortion as a matter of private conscience. The electoral problem was less Kerry's thoughtful attempt to resolve a painful conundrum than it was George W. Bush's comparative clarity. All that changed under Obama. Evidence suggests that this is not a man who has ever doubted that the abortion rights position is both constitutional and ethical. As a state senator he voted ""present"" on a bill that would have compelled doctors to provide life support to fetuses that survived a termination procedure and were not expected to live. Obama argued that the language of the bill extended the legal protection to a ""pre-viable"" infant and so would not be constitutional. (PolitiFact notes that Illinois ""already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus -- meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body -- then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion."") As a presidential candidate, he trumpeted his support for Planned Parenthood and abortion rights. As president, he reopened the flow of tax dollars via U.S. foreign aid to groups that provide abortion overseas, and he refused to use his authority to support a bill that banned gender-selective terminations. The White House said that bill would ""subject doctors to criminal prosecution if they fail to determine the motivations"" behind abortions, according to news reports. The Democratic Party's platform theoretically contains no limit on access to abortion. In another historical switch, the Democratic platform is now the more radical. The political meaning of the president's approach to reproductive rights is hard to fathom. Conservatives insist that the so-called war on women is a cynical distraction from the poor performance of the economy. But it's hard to imagine that working. Pollsters repeatedly say that abortion rights ranks low on voters' list of priorities, and with unemployment seemingly stuck at higher than 8 percent, some may resent the attempted obfuscation. Pollsters also report that the ""pro-choice"" position is at a record low. If the Democrats wanted a moral issue to beat the Republicans with, they'd probably be better off focusing on same-sex marriage. But maybe it all comes back to likability -- something that Obama easily outranks Romney on. Todd Akin's appalling comments on sexual assault, Paul Ryan's attempt to distinguish between legal varieties of rape, and the conversation among conservatives about abortion in cases of rape and incest -- all of these have communicated the sense that the Republican attitudes toward women are old-fashioned, bordering on medieval. It smacks of precisely what conservatism promises not to be: the state telling people what to do with their lives. And the language is far removed from the experience of most people, for whom all rape is rape and contraception is a reality, not a theological challenge. Perhaps Obama is using abortion less as a specific issue to wedge between Republicans and women than as a way of accentuating the infamous Romney ""weirdo factor."" The narrative throughout Tuesday's proceedings has been that the Democrats are as diverse and ordinary as the rest of America, contrasted with the wealth and social Old World attitudes of the Republicans. The president's approach is a big gamble. It is true that likability matters, and there's no doubt that the news cycle on moral issues currently favors the president (thanks largely to Akin). But the constant reference to abortion rights Tuesday night was at risk of coming off too strong. Abortion is a complex, painful issue that touches upon faith, gender and class. It is not a matter that lends itself well to electioneering. More importantly, there's a danger that in pushing the ""war on women,"" Obama may seem distracted from the real challenges facing America. Jobs, debt and health care are what matter most to voters in 2012. It's still the economy, Mr. President.

Since its inception in 1901, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize has been chosen, in accordance with Nobel's wishes, by a five-member committee of lawmakers elected by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, and assisted by specially-appointed expert advisers. The 2009 committee is headed by Thorbjørn Jagland, a former Norwegian prime minister and the current president of the Storting. The decision-making process starts in September, more than a year before the winner of the prize is announced, when the committee sends out letters to qualified individuals inviting them to nominate contenders -- either individuals, joint individuals or organizations -- for the peace prize. Qualified individuals include members of national assemblies, governments, international courts, heads of universities and academics and previous Nobel laureates. The names of nominees and other information about the deliberation process are kept secret for 50 years. No-one can nominate themselves. The deadline for nominations closes in February when the committee begins its work whittling scores of contenders down to a shortlist, typically of between five and 20 names. Expert advisers are then recruited to provide additional information about the remaining candidates and evaluate their merits. The winner of the prize is decided by a majority vote of committee members at the start of October. Unlike the other Nobel prizes, which are awarded in Stockholm, the peace prize ceremony and laureate's lecture takes place in Oslo in December.","Alfred Nobel determined who would decide winners in his will establishing prizes .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The brazen shooting of a defiant teen blogger has stirred the conscience of Pakistan, a nation plagued for decades by violent extremism. An angry chorus of voices in social media, on the street, in newspapers and over the airwaves has decried the attack against 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai as cowardly and an example of a government unable to cope with militants. ""I blame the Taliban, first and foremost,"" columnist Sami Shah wrote in The Express Tribune, a local English daily. ""I blame the government. All of it."" Malala was slowly recuperating Wednesday after surgeons worked for three hours to remove a bullet lodged in her neck. Opinion: Girl's courage, Taliban's cowardice . On Tuesday, Taliban militants stopped a van carrying three girls, including Malala, on their way home from school in northwestern Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley. One of the gunmen asked which one was Malala Yousufzai. When the girls pointed her out, the men opened fire. The bullets struck all three girls. For two of them, the injuries were not life-threatening. For Malala, it was touch-and-go for a while. ""We are happy that she survived, but are worried too about her health condition,"" said her uncle, Faiz Muhammad, who is with her at a military hospital in Peshawar. On Wednesday, police took the van driver and the school guard into custody for questioning. They also said they'd identified the culprits. Meanwhile, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and issued an ominous threat. ""If she survives this time, she won't next time,"" a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said. ""We will certainly kill her."" ""I have the right of education,"" Malala said in a 2011 interview with CNN. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" In fact, many of Malala's courageous words during that interview take on an even more defiant context. ""When your people need you, you should come up,"" she told CNN's Reza Sayah. ""You should come and stand up for their rights."" Malala also encouraged other young people to take a stand against the Taliban -- and to not hide in their bedrooms. ""God will ask you on the day of judgment where were you when your people were asking you, when your school fellows were asking you, and when your school was asking you that I am being blown up?"" Read more: 14-year-old girl wins Pakistan's first peace prize . Mian Iftikhar Hussein, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa information minister, said he was declaring a bounty of $100,000 for the capture of the culprits in the attempt on Malala's life. Pakistani Army Chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani visited Malala in the hospital and delivered a simple message: ""We refuse to bow before terror."" He also noted that the Taliban lack respect for the ""golden words"" of the Prophet Mohammed -- ""that the one who is not kind to children is not amongst us."" ""In attacking Malala, the terrorists have failed to grasp that she is not only an individual, but an icon of courage and hope,"" the general said. The chief minister of Punjab said he would bear the cost of Malala's treatment, calling her ""the daughter of Pakistan."" The head of PIA, the national airline, said he was putting a plane on standby to take the teenager ""anywhere in the world if needed"" for treatment. Two neurosurgeons, one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom, have also offered to fly to Pakistan if needed, the interior minister said. Throughout the country and around the world, Pakistanis, hurt and angry, prayed. ""Malala is what Taliban will never be,"" said Murtaza Haider, the associate dean of research and graduate programs at the Ted Rogers School of Management at Toronto's Ryerson University, in an opinion piece in the Dawn newspaper. ""She is fearless, enlightened, articulate, and a young Muslim woman who is the face of Pakistan and the hope for a faltering nation that can no longer protect its daughters."" ""If the Taliban wants to fight, then they should pick on someone their own size,"" a girl said on a local news channel. Shamila Chaudhary, a former U.S. National Security Council director for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told CNN the incident reverberates among women and girls and even conservative Muslims. ""The Pakistani Taliban don't have a lot of support in the Pakistani society,"" she said. ""They don't offer social services and justice, they don't offer any alternative to weak government."" This latest incident ""makes them more unpopular"" among masses of people who view the aspirations of Malala and the Taliban's resistance to them as a ""fight between good and evil,"" said Chaudhary, a senior South Asia fellow at the New America Foundation. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the act ""heinous and cowardly"" on Wednesday and said the attackers must be brought to justice. ""The secretary-general, like many around the world, has been deeply moved by Malala Yousufzai's courageous efforts to promote the fundamental right to education -- enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" a representative for Ban said. iReport assignment: Girls + Education = ... Twitter, the closest thing to a barometer of public opinion, likewise lit up. ""Wasn't the brute who put a gun to Malala's little head born to a woman?"" wrote Kamran Shafi. ""Did he have sisters, aunts, a wife or four? Bloody filthy terrorist!"" Pakistan's picturesque Swat Valley was once one of Pakistan's biggest tourist destinations. The valley, near the Afghanistan border and about 186 miles (300 kilometers) from the capital city of Islamabad, boasted the country's only ski resort. It was a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts and visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. But that was before militants -- their faces covered with dark turbans -- unleashed a wave of violence. They demanded veils for women, beards for men and a ban on music and television. They allowed boys' schools to operate but closed those for girls. It was in this climate that Malala reached out to the outside world through her blog posts. She took a stand by writing about her daily battle with extremist militants who used fear and intimidation to force girls to stay at home. Malala's online writing led to her being awarded Pakistan's first National Peace Prize in November. ""I was scared of being beheaded by the Taliban because of my passion for education,"" she told CNN at the time. ""During their rule, the Taliban used to march into our houses to check whether we were studying or watching television."" She said that she wanted to be a political leader, that her country ""needs honest and true leaders."" The Taliban controlled Malala's valley for years until 2009, when the military cleared it in an operation that also evacuated thousands of families. But pockets remain, and violence is never far behind. For Pakistani public officials, Chaudhary said, the incident is a reminder of the Taliban's ends -- keeping girls from going to school and imposing hard-line religious and cultural values. Many are in denial and haven't accepted ""the extent the Taliban will go to impose their cultural values."" There have been other examples of violence against women, Chaudhary said, including the Taliban flogging of a woman caught on video a few years ago. That was ""a trigger event -- it pulled a lot of the political elite out of their denial,"" she said. ""I see this instance as something similar."" Chaudhary said there's a misconception across the world that the political elite sympathize with the Taliban. That's untrue, she said. They are afraid of them and the possibility of violent retribution against officials and government installations. If the government doesn't talk about this latest issue and have justice served, it will be a ""step back,"" she said. Sami Shah, the columnist, said the ruling Pakistan People's Party shares blame. ""There can be a million excuses why the Taliban can still operate with impunity in Pakistan, a lot of them legitimate. But if you are the ruling party, then you must accept responsibility for your failures. And the PPP has resoundingly failed."" Setback for Pakistani teen facing blasphemy charges .

"(CNN) -- Is it a case of British ""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""Pride and Prejudice"" or just a wrong-headed piece of ""Persuasion?"" The British help invent baseball before it traveled to America, according to author Julian Norridge. According to author Julian Norridge baseball originated in Britain, and part of his proof comes from a reference in Jane Austen's novel ""Northanger Abbey."" Norridge, whose book ""Can we Have our Balls Back, Please?"" focuses on Britain's role in writing the rulebooks for a long list of sports, says Austen mentioned baseball in the opening pages of ""Northanger Abbey,"" which was written in 1797-98. Norridge says that Austen referenced the sport while introducing her tomboy heroine Catherine Morland, writing: ""It was not very wonderful that Catherine, who had nothing heroic about her, should prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the country at the age of 14, to books."" He argues in his book that the reference indicates British people were familiar with the sport prior to its supposed invention much later in the United States. ""There's no doubt it was being played in Britain in the late 18th century, and equally no doubt that it traveled to America,"" he writes. Norridge argues evidence of the sport's British origins were covered up by American sports magnate Albert Spalding, who set up a special commission to investigate its origins only to ignore the findings and decide it was invented by General Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown, New York state, in 1839. Doubleday, himself, never claimed any role in the sport's invention and many sports historians have rejected suggestions he played a part. Norridge says the first written evidence of baseball comes from a diary written by William Bray, a teenager from Guildford, Surrey, in 1755.","Author claims baseball originated in Britain and traveled to the United States .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that gives regional leaders 45 days to provide specific plans for an international military intervention to oust rebels in northern Mali. The unanimous resolution Friday marks a key step and speeds up preparations for a possible intervention to retake the region from al Qaeda-linked rebels. Mali plunged into chaos in March after a military ruler overthrew the president, shaking one of West Africa's most stable democracies. The coup leader stepped down in May and transferred power to a civilian transitional government, but uncertainty looms. Ethnic Tuareg rebels and Islamist militants took advantage of the chaos to seize the northern portion of the country. Months later, two groups with ties to al Qaeda toppled the Tuareg movement. The two groups now control two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. West African states and the transitional government have asked the U.N. Security Council to authorize the military intervention. The Security Council on Friday urged the transitional government, the rebel groups and community representatives to ""engage as soon as possible"" to find a peaceful political solution. It also tasked U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with working with West African nations and the African Union to submit to the Security Council within 45 days ""detailed and actionable recommendations"" in preparation for the deployment of an international military force in Mali. United Nations officials should provide military planners to the African Union to assist with the preparations, the resolution said. Recommendations should include the number of forces needed and estimates of how much it would cost, according to the resolution. The resolution comes amid grim reports of human rights violations in the north. Radical Islamists are compiling a list of unmarried mothers in northern Mali, raising fears of cruel punishments such as stoning, amputations and executions, a senior United Nations official said this week. . Islamists controlling most of the north have vowed to impose a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. Local radical groups have said the law condemns relationships outside marriage. The U.N. assistant secretary-general for human rights, who just returned from a visit to Mali, said there are reports Islamist groups are compiling lists of women who have had children out of wedlock, or who were unmarried and pregnant. ""The threat is there, it's real and people live with it and they are afraid of those lists,"" Ivan Simonovic said. ""This could indicate that these women are at imminent risk of being subjected to cruel and inhumane punishment."" Extremists have conducted public executions, amputations, floggings and other inhuman and degrading punishments, Simonovic said. Women and children face greater risk, he said. More women in the region are ending up in forced marriages and the militants are also buying children and enlisting them as soldiers. They are paying the children's families $600 -- a major incentive in a country where more than half the population lives on $1.25 a day, he said. In addition, the Islamists have also banned smoking, drinking, watching sports on television and listening to music.","U.N.

"(CNN) -- Nearly half of the nation's states have new voting measures that could stop some Latinos from heading to the polls in November, a civil rights group said Monday. ""This year, an unprecedented number of voting restrictions impose barriers to voting that disproportionately affect the Latino community,"" said a report from Advancement Project, which has also sued to block such voting measures in a number of states. Monday's report from the organization, which pushes to protect voting rights, was the latest volley in a national battle over such measures that splits largely along party lines. Advancement Project's report points to three different types of efforts in 23 states that it says will impact eligible Latino voters: efforts to purge rolls of non-citizen voters, proof of citizenship requirements for voter registration and photo ID laws. Campaigns battle over narrow groups of voters . It is difficult to calculate exactly how many Latinos could be affected, Katherine Culliton-Gonzalez, director of voter protection for Advancement Project, told reporters in a conference call Monday. Based on U.S. Census population data of eligible Latino voters in the 23 states with what Advancement Project calls ""voter suppression policies,"" she said, the organization estimates that obstacles could deter or prevent more than 10 million Latino citizens from registering and voting in the 2012 elections. Romney steps up effort to woo Latino voters . But one conservative Hispanic leader said Monday that the group's estimate sounds ""completely ridiculous."" ""It is a number that simply is not believable,"" said Rosario Marin, an advisory committee member for the Hispanic Leadership Network and a former treasurer of the United States during President George W. Bush's administration. Advancement Project said its figure was a conservative estimate, pointing to letters it says Florida officials sent to thousands of registered voters asking them to prove their citizenship or be purged from the voting rolls. The intimidating impact of such letters extends far beyond those directly involved, Culliton-Gonzalez said Monday. ""Discrimination works that way,"" she said. ""It exponentially affects the entire community."" And, she said, it can influence the results of the election. But Marin said voter ID laws were a positive step. ""It's something very important so that we have integrity of the vote. When it is not done, there are questions about whether in reality people have the right to vote,"" she said. ""When we have the identification it eliminates the need for any questions."" Advancement Project's report said the organization's arguments are based on an analysis of government documents and data, media reports and scholarly works. The organization has been involved in a number of legal challenges to recent state voting measures, including a high-profile case over Pennsylvania's controversial voter ID law, which requires voters to present a state-issued photo ID. Earlier this month, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court sent the lawsuit back to a lower court to assess the availability of alternative forms of identification and whether the new law disenfranchises voters. The law's backers argue that it strengthens voting procedures and protects against fraud. Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, signed the law in March after its passage largely along party lines. He said it ""sets a simple and clear standard to protect the integrity of our elections."" Justice Department approves New Hampshire voter law . In its report Monday, Advancement Project countered that evidence shows that in-person voter fraud is ""virtually nonexistent."" ""This is an overly broad method of trying to solve a problem that doesn't even exist that has a disparate impact on people of color,"" Culliton-Gonzalez said. Debate over the Pennsylvania measure and other similar efforts across the country has largely split along party lines. Republican supporters have argued that the laws would help to fight fraud, while Democrats make the case that the new measures aid Republicans in the voting booth by limiting minority turnout in crucial battleground states. CNN's Halimah Abdullah, David Ariosto and the CNN Political Unit contributed to this report.","A new report is the latest volley in a battle over state voting rules .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- The deaths of 26 victims in the latest wave of violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo might constitute war crimes, a United Nations spokesman said Saturday. A Congolese girl cries as she walks with her mother near Kibati on Friday. It is unclear who was responsible for the deaths in the village of Kiwanja or how many of the victims were civilians. But if some of the victims are found to be non-combatants, their deaths could be handled by a war crimes tribunal, said Madnodje Mounoubai, U.N. mission spokesman in Kinshasa. ""Some were combatants, and some were not,"" he said. ""If it is determined that they were not just caught in the crossfire -- that they were pulled out of their homes or singled out for questioning and killed -- that would make it a war crime."" Mounoubai made the remarks one day after leaders at a regional summit called for an immediate cease-fire and the creation of humanitarian corridors in areas plagued by bloody attacks. Fighting broke out at the end of August between the Congolese army and rebel forces led by Gen. Laurent Nkunda. Despite a unilateral cease-fire declared by Nkunda last week, fighting has continued, and there are reports of heavy civilian casualties in recent days. Mounoubai also said that a U.N. team in Kiwanja had confirmed reports of 26 bodies in 11 graves in the village. Residents told the U.N. team that rebels killed the victims amid accusations that they collaborated with government troops, Mounoubai said. In a communique released at the end of Friday's African Union-hosted summit, regional leaders asked for a strengthening of the mandate for peacekeeping forces in the country. There are 17,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Congo, the largest U.N. peacekeeping force in the world, but U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the forces have been ""stretched to the limit."" He said Friday that the recent violence, which the United Nations estimates has displaced 252,000 people, must be prevented from spilling into the wider region. ""Neither the DRC nor Rwanda nor the rest of the Central Africa region can afford to be dragged back into conflict. The international community cannot allow this to occur,"" Ban told the leaders. ""For far too long, peace and security in your region has been threatened by armed groups, domestic and foreign, present on the soil of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They have been operating from there with impunity, aggravating strains between your countries and between your peoples."" The fighting has aggravated an already serious humanitarian crisis, the United Nations and aid groups say. Nkunda was not present at the summit. Congolese President Joseph Kabila and the presidents of Congo's neighboring countries -- Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania, and Yoweri Kaguta Museveni of Uganda -- were among the leaders there. Ban implored the leaders to use their influence in restoring stability to eastern Congo. ""As leaders of Africa, you have a historic responsibility. This is a critical moment for the Great Lakes region and for Africa as a whole. We must put the cycle of violence behind us,"" he said. ""We must build a shared future of stability, peace, development and human rights for all citizens of your countries."" In particular, Ban said, they should urge Nkunda not to resume fighting, prevent him from getting support and urge him to pull back his rebels. Human Rights Watch reported Thursday that Nkunda's rebel forces and the opposing government-backed Mai Mai militias deliberately killed civilians in Kiwanja, in North Kivu, on Tuesday and Wednesday in violation of Nkunda's declared cease-fire. ""Eyewitnesses in Kiwanja told Human Rights Watch that at least 20 persons were killed and another 33 wounded during a battle for the town and in the cleanup operations by Nkunda's forces that followed,"" the group said in a written statement. Nkunda denied Thursday that his soldiers were involved in any civilian killings and said the Mai Mai were dressed in civilian clothing. ""These Mai Mai, these militia were in civil dress. ... We asked the civilian population to get behind the front lines. So, the population were behind the front line,"" he said. ""We cannot kill a civil population."" Human Rights Watch said U.N. peacekeepers in the area were unable to protect civilians. After the rebels re-established control of Kiwanja on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch said, they ordered all 30,000 residents of the town to leave. They then sought out and killed civilians, particularly men, whom they accused of supporting their enemies, the groups said. ""People in Kiwanja said they heard screams into the night and saw bodies on the streets the following morning,"" Human Rights Watch said. One of those killed was a journalist working for a local radio station, the group said. Witnesses said Mai Mai militias targeted civilians in Kiwanja, including those they accused of supporting Nkunda's forces, Human Rights Watch said. The conflict in Congo is complicated by outside forces and a variety of armed groups fighting both the government and each other. Some analysts say Rwanda is Nkunda's principal supporter. Rwanda denies that. For several years, it has called for the disarming of Rwandan Hutu rebels, many of whom are in eastern Congo.","NEW: If civilians were killed, deaths may constitute war crimes, spokesman says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Dozens of fishing boats and 12 coast guard ships from Taiwan briefly entered waters close to a disputed island chain in the East China Sea, Japan's Coast Guard said on Tuesday. The Coast Guard said the vessels had left Japanese territorial waters by noon local time after it issued a warning and fired water cannons at the ships. It said the Taiwan coast guard vessels fired water from high-pressure hoses in return. It added that 10 Chinese surveillance ships were in the area but none had strayed into waters regarded by Japan as its territory. The long-running dispute over the islands has flared up in recent months, triggering anti-Japanese protests in China. Taiwan, China and Japan all claim ownership of the islands. Read more: Behind the islands dispute . Taiwan news agency CNA said that up to 100 fishing boats, escorted by 10 coast guard ships, were making the voyage to assert local fishermen's rights to operate in the waters. It said the fishing boats came as close as three nautical miles to the islands before turning away. Wang Jinn-wang, head of Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration, was quoted as saying the flotilla was ""the biggest ever action"" to support Taiwan's sovereignty over the islands. CNA said the island chain lies 100 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan. Earlier this month, the Japanese government bought the disputed islands -- known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China and Taiwan -- from the Japanese family that owned them for 2.05 billion yen (US$26.2 million). The move infuriated China. Protests erupted across dozens of Chinese cities, forcing the closure of a number of Japanese businesses and factories as residents railed against anything representative of Japan or its people. Interactive: Disputed islands: Who claims what? While Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a breakaway province, has long been a claimant in the Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute, the self-governing island has seldom rigorously advanced its claims because of an unwillingness to risk its good relationship with Japan, said Alan Dupont, a strategic analyst at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. He said Taiwan's decision to become more assertive was a response to recent action taken by China and Japan, as well as concerns over access to fishing and marine resources. ""Under the Law of the Sea, you have to demonstrate an ongoing interest in the islands over a period of time. It rewards countries that assert their claims,"" he said. China says its claim to the islands goes back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. Beijing and Taipei both claim they inherit China's historic sovereignty over the island. Taiwan is governed by the nationalist Kuomintang party that fled to Taiwan after losing to China's communists in 1949. ""The islands get subsumed in the long-running dialogue about reunification,"" said Dupont. ""It is one situation where strategic objectives are in sync."" Dupont also said Taiwan's protest would be an unwanted complication for the U.S. as it tries to strengthen its relationships in Asia to counter China's rising power.

"(CNN) -- Football legend Diego Maradona has been officially confirmed as the new coach of the Argentina national side. Maradona will get the chance to test his coaching credentials at the highest level. Julio Grondona, the president of the Argentinian Football Association, made the much-anticipated announcement in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. ""Today is a special day for Argentinian football,"" said Grondona. Maradona, 48, will be assisted by former Argentina coach Carlos Bilardo, who will act as general manager. Maradona's first match in charge wil be a friendly against Scotland in Glasgow on November 19. He then faces a tougher task in making sure Argentina qualify for the 2010 World Cup finals from the South American group. ""It's an honor,"" Maradona said. ""It's a dream come true. I'm going to give it my all to make sure that things go well. We're going to work everyday so that Argentina has a national team that keeps getting better and better."" Maradona wasted little time in stamping his authority in his new job, announcing that Liverpool's Javier Mascherano would replace Javier Zanetti as captain of the Argentina side. ""I want Mascherano to be my captain because I believe he is the Argentinian player who is closest to the idea I have about the Argentinian shirt -- sweat for it, sacrifice for it, being a professional, being close to the teammate,"" he said. News of Maradona's likely appointment broke last week after a meeting with Grondona and in subsequent media interviews it became clear that he was going to take on the job. Maradona told Fox Sports that ""my path is with the national team ... my path is to speak with the players, try to put together a solid group with Carlos. ""I'll put together the team, I'll choose the players and I'm sure Carlos will take care of a ton of other things. ""For me, this only compares to the birth of my two daughters"" Dalma and Giannina,"" he added. Maradona's well-publicized off-field antics make him a controversial appointment, despite the hero worship status he enjoys in Argentina after almost singlehandedly leading them to the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. They were beaten four years later by hosts Germany in the 1990 final. Maradona also played in the 1994 World Cup in the United States, but was sent home in disgrace after a positive drugs test. It was a sad end to a glittering career which saw him lead unfashionable Napoli to two Italian League titles. The world transfer record was broken when he joined Barcelona in 1982 and he went on to be regarded as perhaps the greatest footballer who ever played the game. Maradona is best known for his two goals in the 2-1 victory over England in the quarterfinal of the 1986 World Cup. The first was the ""Hand of God"" goal when he punched the ball beyond goalkeeper Peter Shilton and the second was a ""Goal of the Century"" contender in the shape of a spectacular 60-metre weave through six England players. Critics say he is inexperienced in a coaching role, having failed in brief stints with Argentine teams Deportivo Mandiyú and Racing Club during the mid-90s, but Grondona defended his appointment. ""We have the security of excellence,"" he said.","Diego Maradona appointed coach of Argentina's national team .

"(CNN) -- The old adage ""beauty is only skin deep"" has turned out to be true, and filmmaker Timothy Greenfield-Sanders is a living witness. For his latest documentary, ""About Face: Supermodels Then & Now"" -- premiering on HBO on Monday --- the lensman exposes a side of the fashion business rarely seen by the masses, in which some of the most legendary and beautiful clotheshorses open up about their triumphs and struggles in and out of the spotlight. HBO is owned by CNN's parent company. The hour-plus-long film, which debuted this year at the Sundance Film Festival, features interviews with household names like Christie Brinkley, Beverly Johnson, Calvin Klein, Isabella Rossellini, Christy Turlington Burns and Cheryl Tiegs alongside industry pioneers such as Carmen Dell'Orefice, China Machado, Eileen Ford, Pat Cleveland and Bethann Hardison. Unlike other accounts of the fashion business -- such as popular fictional films like ""Mahogany,"" ""Zoolander"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and the documentary ""The September Issue"" -- ""About Face"" let the models do the talking. ""People go into the film thinking, 'Oh, it's going to be some kind of fluffy film about the fashion world,' and then they leave it overwhelmed,"" Greenfield-Sanders said from his home in upstate New York. ""I think that everyone was very honest in the film,"" he added. ""And that's what I appreciated, them giving me their 100%. They gave me a lot and were very open."" The film begins with 81-year-old Dell'Orefice candidly comparing her plastic surgery to repairing a ceiling that's falling down. The New York native is regarded as the world's oldest working model and started at Vogue magazine at the tender age of 15. Another eyebrow-raising moment comes with anecdotes from another octogenarian: Machado, who became the first ethnic model to grace the cover of Harper's Bazaar in 1959 after legendary fashion photographer Richard Avedon blackmailed the magazine's publisher into putting her on it. Three years later, the Shanghai-born beauty would become fashion editor of the same publication. ""It started out in this '70s and '80s world,"" Greenfield-Sanders explained. ""And I realized that I wanted to go deeper in front of that, and I wanted to do people from the '60s and even the '50s. Part of that was because they are still alive. You can still have a first-person conversation with (them)."" The auteur behind such acclaimed documentaries as ""Lou Reed: Rock and Roll Heart,"" ""Thinking XXX"" and ""The Black List"" series became inspired to do the project after a chance encounter. His friend Harry King, a well-known fashion hairdresser, hosted a party three years ago in New York as a reunion of sorts with people from the past who were his current Facebook friends. Greenfield-Sanders double-parked his car to run in for five minutes and ended up staying for hours. ""My life changed,"" he said. ""I knew a few of their names, and there were a handful of models there, and I thought, 'This could be a interesting group portrait,' "" he said. ""And that was the beginning of what I wanted to do. ... As I got to know them, I realized that this could definitely be a film."" ""I liked the idea of strong women who had kind of reinvented themselves, who have gone through tremendous fame and glamour and how they deal with that."" The conversation around ageism is what mostly piqued his interests, he admitted. ""That's something I think about a lot. I'm 60 years old. How does the world treat you as you get older? How do you deal with the fact that you're not the best-looking person anymore if your life is all about your looks?"" Beverly Johnson, the first African-American woman to grace the cover of Vogue, appears in the film, as does another black beauty (""one-eighth African-American,"" she clarifies in ""About Face""): Cleveland, who spoke poignantly about being attacked in the racist South during her early days modeling with the Ebony Fashion Fair. Cleveland would flee the United States for Europe until women of color were represented more in fashion in her homeland. Marisa Berenson revealed how her grandmother, famed fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, ended a longtime friendship with then-Vogue editrix Diana Vreeland after she hired her as a model for the magazine. Isabella Rossellini opened up about how her long-term contract as a spokesmodel for LancÃ´me cosmetics ended once she turned 40. And Bethann Hardison, who is more known for managing and shaping supermodels' careers, shared intimate stories about growing up in Brooklyn and how her mother thought she was a prostitute when she embarked on a modeling career. There were a few coveted cover girls, like Twiggy, who were out of his reach. ""I think the film covers all of the areas that I wanted to cover. It covers the fun of fashion and modeling and the excitement of being that beautiful and having people turning everyone's heads,"" he noted. ""It covers the drugs, the racism and the plastic surgery, and it's a very wide-ranging film. And I like that about it. And we like stories."" Kim Alexis, one of the top models of the '80s, was elated to be a part of the film and to reconnect with friends she hadn't seen in years. ""Modeling is a lonely business. We show up for jobs by ourselves, and each day is a new venture, no team, no office camaraderie. To be able to take a photo with my favorite models, doing what we did best, was a great day."" The former Revlon spokesmodel released her literary debut, a novel titled ""Beauty To Die For,"" this week. Like her book -- a sudsy murder mystery -- she said ""About Face"" offers a voice for the silent. ""Modeling is silent. People don't know or understand how we feel as we work."" Alexis recently hobnobbed with some of the film's subjects and the New York glitterati at the premiere party at the Paley Center for Media, which will house the corresponding portrait exhibit through September. ""How good it was to hear these women's past and present thoughts, how everyone looked so good -- still -- and what a great thought on the part of Timothy Greenfield-Sanders to think it was worth sharing,"" said model Tyson Beckford, who attended the party. ""No matter who you are, a good story is always worth listening to, and a beauty-related issue keeps it interesting."" With the increasing growth and mass appeal of image-savvy social media apps and smartphones (equipped with state-of-the-art camera lenses) Greenfield-Sanders understands his lofty position as the poster child for portraiture. And it's not something he takes for granted. ""I have been very aware of this and how the world had gotten so much faster and bigger, and if you don't have a photo show and a movie and a book and a DVD and a CD all at once, you just get lost, and I've been lucky as an artist, because I started out as a filmmaker but then became a photographer, so I'm skilled in all of these areas,"" he said. ""I think, if you can, you need to be in as many mediums as possible at the same time.""","""About Face: Supermodels Then & Now"" premieres tonight .

"London (CNN) -- Lawyers for radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri and four fellow suspects presented last-ditch arguments Tuesday against their extradition from Britain to the United States to face terrorism charges. Al-Masri, whose followers included the so-called ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid and who once called al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden a ""hero,"" faces 11 charges in U.S. courts. Extradition ruling marks end of era for radical cleric . The charges include conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 Westerners in Yemen, and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon in 1999. He faces a potential life sentence if convicted. Last week, after almost a decade of legal battles, the European Human Rights Court ruled that the cleric and four other suspects could be sent to the United States. The men's lawyers appealed the ruling. A two-judge panel at London's High Court must now decide whether the defendants' lawyers can show new and compelling reasons to stop the extradition. Lawyers for Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz argued Tuesday that if they are extradited to the United States, their detention in super-maximum security prisons would breach their human rights under European law. The court was also told that new evidence from an al Qaeda informer weakened the case against Al-Fawwaz in relation to his alleged involvement in bomb attacks against U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998. The informer, L'Houssaine Kherchtou, made no mention of Al-Fawwaz's name in an 800-page briefing document given to MI6, Britain's spy agency, the court heard. Kherchtou, a Moroccan, was an early member of al Qaeda who pleaded guilty in 2000 to his involvement in the East Africa bombings and gave evidence against co-defendants. In return, he entered a witness protection program. Lawyers for the United States argued, however, that there was a strong case against both Bary and Al-Fawwaz. This included the presence of Bary's fingerprints on a claim of responsibility faxed before the bomb even went off, they said. The other suspects facing extradition to the United States are Syed Thala Ahsan and Babar Ahmad. Apart from al-Masri, none has been convicted of any offense. The lawyer representing al-Masri is expected to present his arguments against extradition on Wednesday, one of them being his client's failing health. The judge will also question lawyers from London's Metropolitan Police Service and Britain's government-run Crown Prosecution Service. They are expected to face questions about why they passed key evidence straight to American authorities rather than pursuing prosecutions in the United Kingdom. Born in Egypt in 1958, al-Masri traveled to Britain to study before gaining citizenship through marriage in the 1980s. A one-time nightclub bouncer in London's Soho district, al-Masri -- also known as Mustafa Kamal Mustafa -- has said he lost both hands and one eye while fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He often wore a hook in place of one hand. In 1997, al-Masri became the imam of a north London mosque, where his hate-filled speeches attacking the West began to attract national attention and followers, including Reid, the so-called ""shoe bomber"" who attempted to blow up a Miami-bound passenger airplane three months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Al-Masri has called the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center ""a towering day in history"" and described bin Laden as ""a good guy and a hero."" He also described the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003 as ""punishment from Allah"" because the astronauts were Christian, Hindu and Jewish. The cleric is one of the highest-profile radical Islamic figures in Britain, where he was already sentenced to seven years for inciting racial hatred at his north London mosque and other terrorism-related charges. Last week's decision, which was signed by seven judges from different European nations, followed a ruling this spring in which the same court likewise said that Hamza and the four other terror suspects could be extradited. The suspects would not get ""ill treatment"" in super-maximum security prisons if they are extradited to the United States and convicted in American courts, according to the European court's decision last Monday. That ruling noted that conditions in such U.S. prisons are in some ways better for inmates than in Europe, given that they'd have access to television, newspapers, social visits and hobby-related items. It acknowledged the prisoners might be confined to their cells most of the time, but said this was warranted given the charges they face. More: BBC apologizes to Queen Elizabeth over Abu Hamza .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African commission tasked with investigating the killings of dozens of striking miners by police started its proceedings Monday with a moment of silence and the reading of the victims' names. President Jacob Zuma ordered the inquiry into the killings, one of the deadliest attacks since the end of apartheid in 1994. The proceedings are open to the public except in cases where officials believe justice will be undermined, the commission said in a statement. For the next two days, the commission will look into how the events unfolded. Members plan to visit the settlement where the miners lived to assess conditions. The strikes started in August at Lonmin-owned Marikana platinum mine in the nation's northwest. Police opened fire on demonstrators the same month, killing 34 workers. An additional 10 people died in the protests, including two police officers. South African authorities at first charged 270 miners with murder before dropping the charges pending further investigation. Workers at the mine ended their weekslong strike last month after accepting a pay hike of up to 22%. Rights groups are calling for transparency and fairness in the proceedings. ""The powers and ability of the Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate the deaths of 44 people near Lonmin's Marikana mine in August must be clarified to ensure justice and redress for all those affected,"" Amnesty International said in a statement last week. Amnesty expressed concerns on the safety of witnesses and whether the commission has enough resources to support those providing evidence to the inquiry. ""Many potential witnesses may need financial support to engage with the commission, including for legal advice and transport,"" Amnesty said. The commission will look into the conduct of Lonmin, the South African police and the workers' unions during the strikes. It will have the powers to issue subpoenas and conduct searches. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse reported from Johannesburg; Faith Karimi from Atlanta .","NEW: The commission members plan to visit the settlement where the miners lived .

"Paris (CNN) -- Police who searched buildings in Paris as part of a far-reaching investigation into a suspected terrorist cell found ""all the elements needed for making explosives,"" prosecutors said Wednesday. The searches were connected to a big police operation Saturday targeting radical Islamists suspected of involvement with the bombing of a Jewish supermarket in September. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Wednesday that the 12 suspects in custody would be detained for an additional 24 hours. Normally French authorities can only hold suspects for 96 hours before they must press charges or release them. Police who searched premises in Torcy, about 25 kilometers (16 miles) east of Paris, overnight Tuesday found bags of potassium nitrate, sulfur, saltpeter, pressure cookers and headlight bulbs, all items useful in making homemade explosives, Molins said in a statement. A shotgun and handgun were also found, he said. The search continued Wednesday morning. The premises where the alleged explosives components were found are used by the same person at whose address a list of Jewish organizations was found by police Saturday, Molins said. Read more: Two arrested at London airport in terror probe . However, police inquiries suggest that two people suspected of throwing a grenade through the window of the Jewish supermarket in Sarcelles, a Paris suburb, may still be at large, he said. Given the nature of the discoveries made by police and the need to find all the members of the presumed terror cell, it was vital to extend the detention of the suspects by an additional 24 hours, Molins said. This step is allowed under French law if there is a serious risk of an imminent terrorist threat, and can be renewed once, leading to a maximum possible period of detention without charge of six days. It is only the second time this provision has been used since it came into law in 2006, he said. ""We are clearly and objectively facing a terrorist cell of an extreme dangerousness,"" Molins said. Authorities will do everything in their power to put an end to the cell's actions and avoid any risk of a terrorist attack in France, he said. The suspects are being held on suspicion of having links to terrorism, manufacturing deadly explosives, illegal possession of weapons and attempted homicide of police officers. Read more: Spain 'al Qaeda cell' may have targeted Gilbraltar . Three of them have criminal records for drug trafficking, theft or violence, Molins told reporters Saturday. One man who was arrested on top of a building in Torcy on Saturday was armed with a loaded .22-caliber pistol, Molins said. The chief suspect in the September bombing, 33-year-old Jeremie Louis-Sidney, died in Saturday's operation as he traded gunfire with police in a Strasbourg apartment building. French intelligence operatives had been monitoring him since spring -- well before the Sarcelles attack -- but he had not been questioned by authorities, Molins said. He was sentenced to two years in prison in 2008 after being convicted of drug trafficking. ""He appeared (to be) a delinquent converted to radical Islam,"" Molins said. Police seized items such as ammunition, a list of ""Israelite"" organizations in and around Paris, a publication produced by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, wills, computer equipment and 27,000 euros ($35,000) in cash, the prosecutor added.","Bomb-making materials were found at premises used by a terror suspect, prosecutor says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British television audiences will be shown an assisted suicide for the first time Wednesday, when a documentary is aired about a man taking his own life at a Swiss clinic. Craig Ewert, along with his wife Mary, hears final instructions from Dignitas escort Arthur Bernhard before taking a fatal dose of barbiturates. The documentary for broadcaster Sky will show the final moments in the life of 59-year-old Briton Craig Ewert, a retired university professor, as he takes a lethal dose of sedatives under medical supervision. The father-of-two had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease -- a rare condition caused by the breakdown of nerve cells in the brain that control the muscles -- five months before his death at Swiss euthanasia clinic, Dignitas. He decided that he didn't want to continue suffering as a prisoner in his own body. Ewert's story follows a number of high-profile assisted suicide cases in the UK -- where the practice is illegal -- in recent years, with opinion divided as to whether those involved should face prosecution. What's your view? Click here to comment . With this in mind, we answer some of the main questions related to the practice. What is assisted suicide? This is where the person who is going to die needs help to kill themselves and asks for it. It may be something as simple as getting drugs for the person and putting those drugs within their reach. It differs slightly from euthanasia, which involves the deliberate killing of a person for the benefit of that person. What are the laws on assisted suicide in the UK? Assisted suicide is currently illegal in the UK, with the 1961 Suicide Act making it an offence to ""aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another."" Helping somebody to die carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years. Have people been prosecuted here for assisting suicide? No. A decision by Britain's Crown Prosecution Service on December 10 effectively ruled out the prosecution of families who assist in such ""mercy killings,"" when it decided no charges would be brought against the parents of a paralyzed rugby player. Daniel James, 23, died with the aid of his parents in a Dignitas assisted suicide clinic last year after deciding he was no longer able to live with the injuries he sustained playing rugby at university.  Watch more about the case » . In a landmark decision, Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said there was ""sufficient evidence"" to prosecute the couple, but that it would not be in the public's interest to do so. In a statement he pointed to the fact that Daniel, ""as a fiercely independent young man, was not influenced by his parents to take his own life and the evidence indicates he did so despite their imploring him not to."" Has there been a push to change the law in the UK? The issue was brought to widespread attention in 2002 when Diane Purdy, a terminally ill woman, failed in a legal bid for her husband to be allowed to help her take her life without fear of prosecution. Her lawyers had argued that under the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to respect for private life and bans inhuman and degrading treatment, she should be allowed to die with dignity, rather than face the distressing final stages of her disease. She eventually died in a hospice in Luton, England. Since then several attempts to legalize assisted suicide in the UK have been rejected. The most recent, in 2006, was defeated in the House of Lords -- the country's upper house in parliament -- by 148 votes to 100. In Scotland, which has its own legal system, veteran MP Margo MacDonald has launched a campaign to legalize the practice. MacDonald, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, said people should have the right to choose the time and place of their death. She hopes to bring legislation before Scotland's parliament next year. Why can it be done in Switzerland? Who does it? Swiss charity Dignitas was founded in 1998 and has helped hundreds of people across Europe to commit suicide. Dignitas takes advantage of Switzerland's liberal laws on assisted suicide which suggest that a person can be prosecuted only if they are acting out of self interest. Campaigners see the absence of a complete ban on assisted suicides as tacit permission to proceed - although their stance has never been tested in the Swiss courts. The charity is run by lawyer Ludwig Minelli, who believes that he is helping people ""die with dignity.""","Final moments in the life of 59-year-old Briton Craig Ewert shown on TV .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The man tapped as Afghanistan's next intelligence chief faces allegations of drug trafficking and torture that stem from his work as a powerful official in the rough-and-tumble Taliban-birthplace of Kandahar, according to testimony from a top Canadian diplomat and other sources familiar with the new appointee. A staunch Karzai loyalist and anti-Taliban fighter known for his experience and heavy-handed tactics, Asadullah Khalid is the country's minister of tribal and border affairs who oversees its southern security forces. On Sunday evening, President Hamid Karzai officially nominated the Pashtun leader as head of the National Directorate of Security. But last week, top-level government leaks regarding the president's choice stirred controversy in the region and protest from rights groups. Dogged by accusations of abuse and trafficking, Khalid must still pass a legislative vote of confidence before assuming the coveted leadership post atop the country's main intelligence agency. Afghan president dismisses intelligence chief amid cabinet shakeup . Much of the concern stems from the testimony of Richard Colvin, Canada's former deputy ambassador to Afghanistan, who worked directly with Khalid while he was governor of Kandahar from 2005 to 2008. In 2009, Colvin testified before Canada's parliament that his team had uncovered ""very credible"" evidence of torture being used by Afghan authorities in Kandahar, which allegedly included Khalid's direct involvement. ""He was known to us very early on, in May and June 2006, as an unusually bad actor on human rights issues. He was known to have had a dungeon in Ghazni, his previous province, where he used to detain people for money, and some of them disappeared,"" Colvin said in his testimony. ""He was known to be running a narcotics operation. He had a criminal gang. He had people killed who got in his way."" The Canadian diplomat also testified that ""in Kandahar we found out that (Khalid) had indeed set up a similar dungeon under his guest house."" ""He acknowledged this. When asked, he had sort of justifications for it, but he was known to personally torture people in that dungeon,"" said Colvin. A high-level diplomatic source, who declined to be named, said a more recent independent review offered ""credible evidence that (Colvin's account of Khalid had indeed) occurred,"" though the source declined to elaborate beyond what was already in the diplomat's public testimony. The Canadian inquiry was formed as a result of a complaint into whether detainees captured by Canadian soldiers and handed over to Afghan authorities in Kandahar were being mistreated. The investigation led to a new agreement in which Canadian officials were allowed greater access to Kandahar prisons, but it also shed light on the nature of NATO's partnerships in the volatile Afghan south. Canada's forces had been largely deployed to Kandahar, considered the Taliban heartland, which borders Pakistan and is thought to be essential to Afghan national security. A second source, who agreed to be identified only as a former Western official with considerable knowledge of Kandahar, said ""it was widely believed that (Khalid) got his hands dirty and did some of this (torture) himself."" But Khalid has rejected those accusations, blaming them on enemies threatened by his success. ""I know there is nothing (in terms of evidence),"" he said last week. ""This is just propaganda about me."" Karzai's office also called the accusations false. But Human Rights Watch weighed in on Friday and called on the Afghan president to ""drop reported plans to appoint a senior official linked to torture,"" referring to Khalid. ""He's viewed as a pretty brutal, but reliable person to be fighting Taliban,"" said the high-level diplomatic source, who declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the matter. ""When you see he was put into Kandahar after Ahmed Wali Karzai got killed, that's significant."" Wali Karzai, the president's half-brother and once a powerful southern political figure, was gunned down by a bodyguard in Kandahar last year. The Taliban claimed responsibility, though reports later surfaced that the killing may have instead stemmed from an internal dispute. Still, his death sent shockwaves across Afghanistan at a time when Taliban fighters appeared to be using assassination tactics against high-profile targets, many of whom were allied to the president. Analysts say Khalid's redefined role over southern security forces may have afforded Karzai a needed ally, particularly in the absence of his younger brother. But it may have also cast Khalid as a more prominent figure leading up to the nation's presidential elections, which are slated for 2014. ""One possible course of action is that Karzai tries to retain power through a successor who is beholden to him -- sort of the Medvedev model,"" said Sarah Chayes, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to how Russian President Vladimir Putin anointed Dmitry Medvedev as his successor in 2006. ""Khalid is a candidate for that role. Moving him up to a more prominent and responsible position would advance that possibility,"" said Chayes, who first met Khalid when he was appointed as Kandahar governor in 2005. But abuse allegations surrounding the former governor are expected to renew old questions from Western allies, just as NATO eyes its 2014 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Considered an ambitious man despite dropping out of Kabul University, Khalid joined legendary Taliban-fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud, known as the ""Lion of Panjshir,"" before the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. He later worked in conjunction with U.S. Special Forces in southern Afghanistan, according to a former senior Afghan official, who declined to be named, citing security concerns. ""He's thought of as a do-er, a field person. Not a desk person,"" the ex-official said. ""And he is also one of the only ministers I know to travel to Kandahar by road,"" a reference to the region's perilous roadways that are often lined with improvised explosives. But the former official added that he knew of no evidence to support allegations of Khalid's direct involvement in torture. ""Yes, there were people beneath him who made mistakes, but I have no evidence that he was directly involved,"" he said. The U.N. Mission in Afghanistan estimates that torture has occurred with considerable frequency in Afghanistan, and says it is a particular problem within the country's intelligence services. It found ""compelling evidence that 125 detainees (46%) of the 273 detainees interviewed who had been in NDS detention experienced interrogation techniques at the hands of NDS officials that constituted torture,"" according to a U.N. report. Torture, the U.N. said, ""is practiced systematically in a number of NDS detention facilities throughout Afghanistan."" The NDS is Afghanistan's main intelligence agency and reports directly to the president and National Assembly. If confirmed, Khalid's ascension atop the agency would bring a practiced Taliban-fighter and well-connected senior official to a security post critical to the president's inner circle. Others who know him say allegations of abuse and drug trafficking are unfounded. ""He's too smart for that,"" said the former chief of staff of Kandahar's chief of police. The former chief of staff, who goes by the last name Afghan but asked to keep his first name anonymous for security reasons, said Khalid ""didn't need private prisons."" ""He had the NDS,"" Afghan said. ""And he was really good at intelligence in Kandahar."" Afghan also noted that the regional NDS chief reported directly to both Kabul headquarters and to Khalid, a practice thought to be commonplace in Afghanistan. Private detention centers did exist, and likely still do, he said, but just not under Khalid. For instance, a former Kandahar governor -- prior to Khalid -- had once maintained a private prison in Kandahar City across from his office, said Afghan, who noted residents were ""constantly complaining to us"" that they or their friends or their family members had been tortured. ""People were taken out and questioned, hanged to death and beaten to death,"" he said. However, the prison was apparently removed when Khalid assumed power in 2005, Afghan added. CNN could not independently verify that account. If confirmed, Khalid would take over from Rahtamullah Nabil, 42, whose two-year term has expired. Nabil's predecessor, longtime intelligence chief Amrullah Saleh, is now an opposition leader. Meanwhile, Karzai on Sunday also floated replacement possibilities at the Ministries of Defense and Interior, which have been vacant for weeks. Bismillah Khan Mohammedi, a well-connected Tajik leader with robust ties to the Afghan army and police, was tapped to head up the Defense Ministry, Karzai's office reported. But that move is also expected to stir discord among parliament lawmakers who recently dismissed Mohammedi from his post atop the Interior Ministry. ""This is classic Karzai, and trial balloon floating,"" said Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It could be to placate Tajiks. But it's also entirely plausible that he's floating an idea that he expects to be shot down."" ""In Afghan politics, these things are often four levels of gamesmanship,"" said Biddle. The cabinet shakeup comes just one month after Karzai earned international praise for a sweeping set of proposed reforms meant to stem corruption in the war-wracked country. But his moves have also raised new questions about Afghanistan's rising political players, particularly those expected to take over in the wake of the NATO withdrawal.","Asadullah Khalid is accused of drug trafficking and torture .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""Kick-Ass"" actress Chloe Moretz has been chosen for the title role in a movie remake of Stephen King's ""Carrie,"" a horror story about a teenaged girl whose telekinetic powers turn a high school prom into an inferno. The original 1976 movie, directed by Brian DePalma, launched John Travolta's film career and earned Oscar nominations for Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Moretz, 15, tweeted about it Tuesday: ""Never been so happy in my life! Thank you Kim Pierce and thank u MGM for the chance of a lifetime i will never forget!"" Spacek was 26 when she played Carrie White, a socially outcast high school student who grew up sheltered by an abusive mom, played by Laurie. Carrie, in her desire to become accepted by classmates, wanted to attend her school's prom, but her mother objected. ""They're all going to laugh at you,"" her mother told her, a line that became one of the film's most memorable. MGM announced last year that it hired Marvel Comics writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who is also a staff writer on the ""Glee"" TV show, to pen a new script based on King's 1974 novel. The studio did not say when production would begin or when the film would hit theaters. Moretz most recently starred in Martin Scorcese's ""Hugo,"" but her next film to hit theaters is ""Dark Shadows.""

"(CNN) -- For some time now, Republican hawks like Sen. John McCain and Rep. Howard P. ""Buck"" McKeon have been saying that our military budget is inadequate for the threats we face. They like to gripe that President Barack Obama is orchestrating the decline of American power. Some of this is pure partisanship. Republicans criticize Democrats just as Democrats criticized President George W. Bush. The hawks, though, have a special devotion to the military budget. In their view, some military spending is good; more is even better. But if overspending on the military and promoting the United States as global policeman are benchmarks of approval, they should have little to complain about with our current president. Contrary to his rhetoric of change, the president sounded like a neoconservative when he declared during his recent State of the Union address that the United States was, and would remain, the world's ""indispensable nation."" Obama's proposed Pentagon budget, released last week, affirmed his intention to retain most of the U.S. military's current missions, even when they aren't needed to safeguard the United States' vital security interests. Meanwhile, the Pentagon's latest strategy document was carefully designed to convince allies and adversaries alike that the United States can continue to prosecute multiple armed conflicts in far-flung corners of the globe. Taken together, Obama's strategy document, budget and State of the Union remarks articulate a coherent philosophy on military spending and global engagement that ought to hold a lot of appeal for the neoconservatives in the GOP. But partisan politics aside, what our foreign policy leaders have consistently ignored is an argument that should have strong sway at a time of economic uncertainty: This country's tax dollars can be better spent than on defending wealthy allies who are more than capable of protecting themselves. The administration plans to withdraw some U.S. troops from Europe, but as many as 70,000 are likely to remain. Meanwhile, the number of troops in Asia will be increased. These troops serve to reassure our allies of our commitment to defend them. It is working as designed: Other countries do not spend enough to satisfy their defense needs. The end result is that Americans pay more. The Obama administration's budget will cost every American nearly $2,000 next year. The figure rises by hundreds of dollars when one accounts for homeland security, payments to veterans, and the few billion dollars tucked away in the Department of Energy for the nation's bloated nuclear arsenal. All told, every American will likely shell out more than $2,700 on spending classified as national defense. That is at least 2Â½ times what the British spend, five times more than what the Germans spend, and six times what the Japanese spend. It is hard to see how that is good news for Americans struggling to make ends meet. Obama's magnanimity is especially ironic given his emphasis on ""fairness"" and ""shared sacrifice."" His rhetoric apparently does not apply to people living outside the United States. American troops will continue to be tasked with policing the world, and American taxpayers will be on the hook to pay for it. The administration has proposed to restrain the growth of military spending. But total U.S. military spending will remain well above pre-9/11 levels. The Obama administration is requesting $525 billion for the Pentagon's base budget in 2013, plus another $88.4 billion to pay for the war in Afghanistan. To put this in perspective, that is more than the annual average during Ronald Reagan's time in office (about $526 billion in today's dollars). One seldom hears GOP hawks speak of Reagan as a misguided dove who left the country vulnerable to attack. Focusing only on budget numbers, however, misses the big picture. Instead, we must focus on what we will spend and why. The answer is clear: Our military budget is large by historical standards because Washington is unwilling to revisit the premise that Americans are responsible for everything that happens in the world, even things that have no connection to American security or prosperity. Our fiscal crisis has created an opportunity to revisit our commitments abroad. We should focus American power on our core interests, and call on other countries to take responsibility for their own defense. Intuitively, that exercise should satisfy both liberal demands that ""everyone pay their fair share"" and conservative demands that our government ""live within its means."" But given the rhetoric we have heard so far, it is doubtful that this election cycle will produce a leader who will seriously contemplate how we can most prudently provide for our common defense.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Averting what could have been another gas crisis across Europe, Russia and Ukraine have fixed a price on natural gas for 2008 while Kiev has promised to pay its 2007 gas debts. The last-minute deal mirrored a similar situation in 2006, when Russia briefly cut off gas supplies to Ukraine over pricing differences. Ukraine is the largest facilitator of natural gas to European Union countries, and the disruption caused shortages in Western Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko announced on Tuesday they had reached agreement on the gas issue at a news conference in Moscow following their talks. The Russian natural gas company, Gazprom, had threatened to stop supplying gas to Ukraine on Monday, then extended the deadline until Tuesday evening while talks continued. The two leaders said several other issues between the countries had been resolved, as well. Yushchenko said Ukraine will pay its gas arrears of 2007 and will be a stable transit supplier to Western Europe. A final agreement will be signed in the next few days and payment for gas already used will begin shortly, Putin said. After the gas cut-off in 2006, EU leaders called for solutions that would allow the union to avoid being a victim of disputes between Russia and other former Soviet republics. A consortium of countries banded together to fund the Nabucco pipeline, a $7.4 billion (5 billion euros) project that will bring gas from Turkey's borders with Georgia and Iran to Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria, and then on to Central and Western Europe, according to the Nabucco Web site. Construction is to begin in 2009 on the 3,400-km (2,113-mile) pipeline, and it's expected to be operational in 2013. But Gazprom, along with Italy's ENI, is planning a 900-km (560-mile) pipeline following a similar route to feed into Austria and Italy, a project that would cost between $14.6 billion and $17.5 billion (10 billion to 12 billion euros). Last week, the managing director of Nabucco Gas Pipeline International, Reinhard Mitschek, announced that Gazprom may also send gas through the Nabucco pipeline. Critics say the move would undermine the purpose of the project, which was to reduce European dependence on Russian gas.

"SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (CNN) -- Richard Holbrooke first visited Bosnia in 1992 as a private citizen. Richard Holbrooke's 'bombs for peace' policy was vindicated when bombings brought an end to the war. Three years later, he would become one of the most influential U.S. figures working to end a war that had introduced a new euphemism for genocide: ethnic cleansing. Holbrooke, who had worked as a diplomat, journalist and investment banker, was intrigued, disgusted and challenged by what he saw in the early days of the war in Bosnia. A month before his first visit, reporters had learned of Bosnian Serb concentration camps where Muslim prisoners were tortured, sexually mutilated and executed. The news photographs and footage seemed like an echo of the Holocaust. In the ethnically mixed capital, Sarajevo, Holbrooke saw Bosnian Serb forces laying siege to the city to drive out Muslims. U.N. peacekeepers even had to negotiate with the aggressors just to truck food into the starving city. In Banja Luka, Holbrooke saw Muslim families being forced to sign over their property to Bosnian Serbs -- Orthodox Christians -- in exchange for their lives and a one-way bus ticket out of town. Returning with CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour in 2008, Holbrooke remembered feeling the connection with his own family history: His Jewish grandfather fled Germany shortly after Hitler took power. ""I thought I'm seeing a color remake of the black and white scenes we'd seen in World War II of Jews signing away their property at the point of a gun and then being shipped off to who knows where,"" Holbrooke said. ""I don't think you have to be Jewish to understand that what you're seeing was a genuine crime against humanity. The Europeans were doing nothing, and the Americans were doing less.""  Watch as Holbrooke talks with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at the scene of the crime » . Holbrooke thought only a U.S.-led intervention would stop the slaughter. ""The [Bosnian] Serbs would have melted away because they were thugs and bullies,"" he said. But the White House was vowing to stay out. ""The United States is not going to inject itself into every single crisis, no matter how heart-rending,"" then-President George H.W. Bush said. Holbrooke, who had served President Jimmy Carter as an assistant secretary of state, offered his recommendation to Bill Clinton's advisers during the 1992 presidential campaign: Direct use of force against the Bosnian Serbs. ""I took a stand that I believed was correct,"" Holbrooke said. ""I didn't think it was so controversial."" When Clinton embraced a get-tough policy, Holbrooke was optimistic. In the back of Holbrooke's mind, there was a lingering question: ""Will he do as president what he said he would do as a candidate?""  Watch Clinton's campaign pledge » . Holbrooke wanted to handle Bosnia for the Clinton administration. But after the election, Holbrooke -- the consummate insider -- found himself on the outside. Instead of getting the Bosnia portfolio, he was named U.S. ambassador to Germany. ""By advocating vigorous action [in Bosnia], I was kind of marginalized by people inside the government who were less in favor of vigorous action,"" he told Amanpour. America's European allies opposed airstrikes, fearing retaliation against their peacekeepers on the ground. Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, told CNN that the Europeans ""were, to put it mildly, extremely reluctant to see us pursue unilaterally any actions which could imperil their troops."" Lake said the president's hands were tied. ""We tried to convince them. And the Europeans said, 'Absolutely no.'"" Over the course of the next year, Clinton was able to persuade his European allies to at least use limited air strikes against the Bosnia Serbs. But it didn't stop the killing. Under mounting criticism in the press, Clinton asked Holbrooke in May 1994 to leave his post in Germany and return to the White House to help with Bosnia. But Holbrooke and others in the administration who advocated force would nonetheless see Bosnia's Muslims endure another 15 months of heartbreak and death -- including the slaughter of 8,000 at Srebrenica.  Watch as a Bosnian concentration camp survivor describes the torture and rape she witnessed » . The massacre shook the world's conscience -- and Clinton's foreign policy. He was now ready to lead, with or without approval from other nations. ""What I said to the Europeans was, 'We're going to do this. And it'll work best if you come with us,'"" Lake recalled. After a Serb mortar attack on a Sarajevo market in August 1995, Clinton pulled the trigger. With the Europeans on board, U.S. and allied planes began attacking Bosnian Serb positions. After eight weeks of NATO bombing, Holbrooke got enough concessions to negotiate an end to 3 ½ years of war. It was vindication for a policy Holbrooke calls ""bombs for peace."" ""I don't like to advocate the use of force, [because] I know people will get killed,"" Holbrooke said. ""But there are times when you have to use force in order to stop people from being killed in larger numbers, and it seemed to me this was a clear-cut example.""","Richard Holbrooke first went to Bosnia in 1992 in the early days of the war .

"(CNN) -- Government investigators found no proof substantiating reports that miners massacred members of an indigenous community in the Venezuelan Amazon, officials said. But activists and indigenous groups said Monday that the government was too swift in denying that dozens of Yanomami Indians died in an attack that reportedly occurred in July, and that was the subject of a call for action last week by a Yanomami organization and other groups. ""It's far too early for the Venezuelan government to be denying this massacre took place,"" said Chloe Corbin, a spokeswoman for London-based Survival International. Allegations of the massacre trickled out of a remote region along the Brazil-Venezuela border, where unauthorized Brazilian gold miners have long clashed with indigenous groups. The Yanomami, who live in both nations, are considered the largest indigenous group in the Americas that remains largely untouched by advances in the outside world. Venezuelan officials said last Wednesday they were investigating reports of an attack. On Saturday, a top official said visits to the region revealed that reports about the alleged massacre were false. ""We can tell the country that there is no evidence of any deaths, nor any evidence of homes burned down in the supposed massacre of 80 of our Yanomami brothers,"" Nicia Maldonado, Venezuela's minister of tribal people, told state-run VTV. On Sunday, the South American country's interior minister described the allegations as ""false news,"" accusing private media companies and members of the opposition of spreading the report. In a Twitter post, Interior Minister Tareck El Aissami said government investigators had visited all of the Yanomami communities and ""all are well."" But a group of organizations representing indigenous people and communities in the Amazon said the investigators hadn't visited the area where the attack is reported to have taken place. For that reason, the groups said in a statement published on the website of the Venezuelan human rights organization Provea, the authorities can't ""say that no evidence proving the alleged massacre has been found."" They urged the government to continue the investigation and to go as far as site of the settlement that was reportedly attacked. The area is a five-hour helicopter ride, or 15 days on foot, from Puerto Ayacucho, the main Venezuelan city in the Amazon, the government said. Survival International, which advocates tribal peoples' rights worldwide, said in a written statement that the government officials' comments are ""not unusual in these circumstances and should be ignored."" ""There is more that needs to be done on the ground to get to the bottom of this reported massacre and find out how many people were affected by it,"" Corbin said. Indians told members of a neighboring Yanomami community that they saw burned bodies and bones in the area where the attack allegedly occurred, according to Survival International, which had contacted local representatives but had not spoken directly with any witnesses of the alleged attack. Of about 80 Yanomami people who lived in the Irotatheri community, only three survivors had been found, according to a declaration published on Survival International's website, purportedly from indigenous organizations. In recent years, the Yanomami tribe has been under increasing pressure as miners illegally entered their land in the search of profits. Miners in Brazil have transmitted diseases such as malaria and flu to the Yanomami, who have little resistance to such diseases, observers say. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: Investigators didn't visit the site of the alleged attack, indigenous groups say .

"(CNN) -- World leaders tackled the bloody 18-month crisis in Syria on Wednesday. Chinese and U.S. diplomats met, Turkey's prime minister spoke and Egypt's president said, ""It's time for a change."" Here are the latest developments: . Clinton, Chinese foreign minister discuss Syria . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi huddled over what Clinton called ""the evolving situation in Syria"" and urged support for ""transition"" in that country. ""With respect to Syria, it is no secret that we have been disappointed by Russia and China's actions blocking tougher U.N. Security Council resolutions, and we hope to continue to unite behind a real path forward to end the violence in Syria,"" Clinton said at a joint news conference with Yang in Beijing. The secretary of state stopped in China during a visit to Asia. The United States believes in a ""peaceful political transition"" in a Syria currently ruled by Bashar al-Assad's regime and wants to work for that goal with China and other nations, Clinton said. ""We haven't agreed on how to handle Syria, but we haven't stopped talking about what should be done, because the violence continues,"" she said. Yang called the situation complex. He stressed China's neutrality and said, ""Any solution should come from the people of Syria and reflect their wishes. It should not be imposed from outside."" ""China has been emphasizing all along that the various parties should arrive at a cessation of fire and an end to violence, and the various parties in Syria should begin a political dialogue. And like many countries, we support a period of political transition in Syria."" Egyptian leader says it's time for a change . Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy called for a transitional phase in Syria and for al-Assad to leave power. ""The Syrian people made their decision, and it is time for change. Let the Syrian leadership learn from the recent lessons of history. Change is due, now,"" he said. Morsy made the comments while addressing a meeting of Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo. Morsy's support of the Syrian opposition reflects his solidarity with the people who took to the streets during the Arab Spring, the popular label for the democratic movements that swept across the Middle East and North Africa last year. Turkey: ""Pre-election situation"" may be impeding U.S. initiative . Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the United States might be holding back on stronger action against Syria because of this year's presidential elections. ""Maybe it's because of the elections -- maybe it's because of the pre-election situation in the States. Might be the root cause of the lacking of initiative,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""Nobody has spoken to us about their reasons, and they are not obliged to state anything. We are very thankful and pleased they have stated that they're against this regime."" Erdogan has called on the U.N. Security Council to declare a no-fly zone along the Turkey-Syria border, but the council is frequently divided between the interests of Western countries and Russia and China. Dozens killed in Syria's largest city . The battle for Aleppo raged, with at least 115 people killed there, opposition activists said. The fatalities are among at least 258 people killed across the country, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.

"(CNN) -- When Tropical Storm Washi ripped through the southern Philippine city of Cagayan de Oro last weekend, it dumped in one day more than the city's entire average rainfall for the month of December. According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, a total of 181 millimeters of rainfall was recorded in the area last Friday, compared to the expected 99.9 millimeters for the whole month. The devastating flash floods, which have so far claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people, arrived just weeks after a report from the UK's Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Change indicated that global warming has significantly increased the number of people at risk from flooding. The report, ""Climate: Observations, projections and impacts,"" examined how climate change will modify the weather in 24 countries around the world. While findings vary from region to region, it forecasts an overall increase this century of coastal and river floods, extreme weather events and a global temperature rise of between 3-5C, if emissions are left unchecked. According to climate change experts, cities from New York in the U.S. to Dhaka in Bangladesh are likely to be heavily affected. Migration . Simon Reddy, executive director of the C40 Cities network, which promotes sustainable development among local city authorities around the world, says this could be a catalyst for migration into urban areas. ""If the forecast temperature rise is accurate, then entire countries could be irrevocably damaged in certain parts of the world -- and their inhabitants will have to find somewhere else to live,"" he said. To illustrate his point, Reddy says that a third of flood-prone Bangladesh, in South Asia, could be made uninhabitable by a two-foot (60 cm) rise in regional sea-levels. The Met Office report echoes this point, predicting that climate change will subject an additional five million people in Bangladesh to floods, if they continue to live in the same place. ""Where are they going to go?"" asks Reddy. ""In most cases they'll move to where the opportunities and the jobs are -- the nearest habitable city."" With 70% of the world's population expected to live in cities by 2050, according to figures from the U.N., the impact of climate change on the urban environment appears more pressing than ever before. Floods . Historically, cities built up around water highways and coastal regions have flourished due to their association with maritime trade and transport, said Jan Corfee-Morlot, senior climate change analyst for the OECD. ""This means that a disproportionately high number of the world's cities are located in areas that are now increasingly at risk of floods,"" she added. According to Morlot, recent risk studies from the OECD as well as the newly published data from the Met Office report predict that extreme ""once-in-a-lifetime"" weather events such as flash floods and coastal hurricanes are going to become significantly more commonplace. But, she says, it's not just cities in the developing world that are ill-equipped to manage the problem. ""In America alone -- New York, Miami, New Orleans -- these cities face terrible exposure to floods, and unlike cities such as Rotterdam (in the Netherlands) -- they do not have the defenses to prevent them."" In the future, Morlot believes that major cities will have to adapt to the reality of regular flooding by building new infrastructure, such as vast flood barriers and ""evacuation avenues"" -- wide roads with dedicated lanes for emergency vehicles. Extreme heat . Global temperatures are projected to rise by between three to five degrees over the next century, according to the Met Office. Dr David Dodman, senior researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development, says that temperatures in the city will far exceed that, due to a phenomenon known as the ""urban heat island effect."" ""The built environment tends to absorb heat during the day and release it slowly at night, so there's little opportunity for the city to cool down"" he said. ""This means that temperature rises from climate change will be significantly exaggerated in urban areas."" Aside from increased instances of heat-related deaths, particularly among the elderly population, Dodman says that the ""wicked irony"" of the urban heat island effect is that it stimulates a demand for air conditioning. ""In places like Delhi, we're seeing a growing middle class use their wealth to pay for electricity-hungry air-conditioning units, which contribute to global warming, and this of course creates a negative feedback loop."" Water shortages . According to Dodman, the predicted rise in global sea levels pose a threat to city aquifers -- underground wells that provide a source of fresh water for many urban settlements around the world. ""In coastal cities, the rise causes 'saline intrusion' -- where salty water gets into the fresh water aquifers, making it undrinkable"" he says. In addition, Dr Doug Crawford-Brown, executive director at Cambridge University's Centre for Climate Mitigation Research, anticipates that stock piles of bottled water will be have to be rationed when fresh water distribution systems buckle under the impact of city floods. ""Even in a developed city like London, which is very well protected by the Thames barrier, high intensity rainfall could create problems with the old sewage system -- causing the potential spread of microbial disease,"" he said. Adaptation . Simon Reddy believes that urbanities of the future will be defined ""not just by how they restrict their own contributions to climate change, but by the infrastructure and policies they employ to defend against the consequences of it."" To this end, Reddy says that many of the cities in the C40 network have already started to implement adaptive measures. ""In Seoul, for instance, they have removed a highway and restored an ancient river running through the city. This creates a wind corridor to it keep cool, and will also help drain water away in times of high rainfall,"" he said. Meanwhile, New York and Tokyo have led the way with green rooftops and urban gardens. ""Urban green spaces are going to be more critical than (they have) ever been,"" he said. ""Not only do they absorb heat and rainfall -- helping to keep cities cool and dry, but they provide opportunities for small scale food cultivation -- so city dwellers can become a little less dependent on imports."" For Matthew Kahn, economics professor at the UCLA's Environment Institute, the accelerated urbanization caused by climate change, will mean that for most cities, the only way is up. The professor, whose book ""Climatopolis"" details how future cities could turn climate change to their advantage, says that he expects future modern cities to accommodate the flood of migrants by building energy efficient high-rise residential tower blocks, over small areas of land -- ""much like we see in Singapore today,"" he said.","Tropical storm in Philippines comes just after report on climate change predicts floods .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Nine people died over two days in clashes between Egyptian police and protesters amid reports of inadequate security at a soccer match that devolved into a riot in which 79 fans were killed, officials said Friday. Six deaths occurred in Suez and three in Cairo, the Health Ministry reported. Among the fatalities was an 18-year-old, the ministry said. More than 2,500 people were injured near the Interior Ministry in Cairo over two days, officials said. Thousands of protesters gathered outside the ministry, prompting riot police to deploy tear gas for fear the men -- some of them masked -- would storm the building. ""The people demand the downfall of the field marshal,"" chanted the protesters, who waved flags from the popular soccer team Al-Ahly, which was playing in the game Wednesday in Port Said after which the riot broke out. Gen. Marwan Mustapha, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said protesters who had taken over a government taxation building were throwing Molotov cocktails from the roof. Nearly 200 police officers were injured, several by birdshot pellets, Mustapha said. Clashes were reported Friday in Suez, where at least 18 people were injured, Deputy Health Minister Hisham Shiha said. In the Sumoha neighborhood of Alexandria, thousands of protesters clashed with police, throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks and setting tires afire, said Tamer Mohamed, an activist who witnessed events there. Police fired tear gas into the crowds and warning shots into the air, he said. Two fires occurred Friday in or near Cairo. In one, the taxation building -- in the center of where demonstrations were going on -- was ablaze. Mahmoud el-Azali, a witness and reporter for Nile TV, said a band of people broke into the building about 9:30 p.m. and set the top floor afire. Though no one was hurt, attempts to put out the massive blaze proved fruitless, he said. Another fire broke out 20 kilometers from Cairo, at the Al Marg police station, said Usama Emam, a national security investigator. Twelve prisoners escaped, he said. The causes of the fires were not immediately clear. Among the people arrested in Cairo were 12 Syrians, said Maj. Karim El-Fouli with the Egyptian police. He said the Syrians were accused of setting the first floor of the Syrian Embassy afire. Outside the police station, about 100 other Syrians demanded their countrymen's release. ""Mubarak gone! Gone! Assad Next! Next!"" they chanted, referring to the toppled Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and his Syrian counterpart, Bashar al-Assad. ""They are here because of the massacre in Homs today,"" said Syrian activist Sumer Badr, in Cairo, referring to violence between Syrian government forces and demonstrators. The Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said in a statement posted on Facebook that the country ""is passing in a sensitive and difficult time that is considered the most dangerous and important in Egypt's history."" The statement continued, ""The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has always reiterated to the military forces that peaceful protests are a right to all people to state their demands."" It called on ""all national and political factions of this nation to remain alert and responsible and to effectively intervene to ensure stability again across Egypt."" On Thursday, two people died in Suez and a military officer was accidentally killed by a vehicle driven by security forces in Cairo, officials said. The latest demonstrations come amid a period of mourning for those who died at the match Wednesday in the Mediterranean city of Port Said. Fans of the hometown Al-Masry club stormed the field after a 3-1 win over Cairo's Al-Ahly club. Rival fans battled with rocks and chairs, and witnesses said many of the Al-Masry fans carried knives and sticks. Many suffocated in the crush of bodies that formed as fans attempting to flee the stadium found their escape blocked by a locked steel gate, survivors said. In the aftermath, horrified fans questioned why police had not stopped the Al-Masry fans from rushing the visitors' stands, why exits were barred and how fans were able to take weapons into the stadium. ""We believe this is something that has been well-organized,"" said Khaled Mortagy, a member of Al-Ahly's governing board. ""I'm sure there are some hidden hands behind this, but we cannot really see, or we cannot really confirm, who is behind all that."" Mamdouh Eid, executive manager of the Al-Ahly fans committee, said authorities contributed to the escalation of violence. ""The police stood there watching, and the ambulances arrived late. I carried several dead fans in my arms,"" he said. But Gen. Ismail Osman, a member of Egypt's military council, told Mehwar TV on Thursday that the military and police were not responsible for what happened. Mustapha said fans stoked tensions during the entire match. ""There were organized groups in the crowds that purposely provoked the police all through the match and escalated the violence and stormed onto the field after the final whistle,"" he said. ""Our policemen tried to contain them but not engage."" The soccer violence reignited demands for Egypt's military-led government to make reforms and improve security. Egypt's fledgling parliament erupted in anger over the national tragedy Thursday, with the debate growing so heated that the body's speaker ordered a live broadcast of the session cut off. The order was retracted after lawmakers objected. A committee will investigate the circumstances behind the riot. Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri suspended Port Said's security chief and the head of police investigation. The two men will face an inquiry. Ganzouri also accepted the resignation of Port Said's governor. The governor and the chief of security, along with the head of the Port Said football federation, the stadium manager and the riot police chief, have all been banned from travel until the investigation is completed. Police have charged 52 people with ""premeditated murder, thuggery, destruction of public property and beatings causing fatal injuries.""

"(CNN) -- Wednesday marks day 2,000 since retired FBI agent Robert Levinson disappeared in Iran, and the State Department is urging Tehran to provide information on his whereabouts. ""Determining Mr. Levinson's whereabouts and reuniting him safely with his family continues to be a priority for the U.S. government. The United States also continues to welcome the assistance of our international partners in this investigation,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. An FBI reward of $1 million for information leading to Levinson's safe return still stands. Levinson, who became a private investigator after retiring from the FBI, was working on a cigarette smuggling case when he disappeared more than five years ago while on a business trip on Iran's Kish island on March 8, 2007. The State Department has consistently denied Levinson was working for the U.S. government and has unsuccessfully pressed Tehran for information. Read more: Who is missing American Robert Levinson? In March 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the U.S. government had received indications that Levinson was being held by a group in a region that includes the border areas of Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan. At the time, the Iranian government said it would make inquiries about Levinson but did not know what happened to him. Later, the FBI said it did not know what group was holding Levinson, what the group's demands might be or even a reason for his capture. Whoever his captors are, they sent a ""proof of life"" videotape and photographs of Levinson to his family in 2010. In the video, Levinson asked the U.S. government for help: ""Please help me get home,"" said a gaunt-looking Levinson on the tape, citing his 33 years of service in the FBI as a reason for that assistance. Levinson suffers from diabetes and appeared to have lost 50 to 60 pounds since his capture. He turned 64 on March 10. In addition to his wife of 38 years, Levinson has seven children and two grandchildren. Levinson's family aired their angst and anguish in a statement released Tuesday: . ""Two thousand days since Bob has heard the voices of his children and his wife, and since we have heard his. Two thousand days since he has worn the clothes in his closet -- which we are sure no longer fit him - and 2,000 days since he has slept on his side of the bed. ""It is time for Bob to be released.""

"(CNN) -- After Michelle Obama's speech Tuesday night, it will be very difficult for her critics to portray her as angry or aggrieved. She rarely raised her voice. She smiled, she charmed, she seemed to tear up. She said not an unkind thing about her political opponents. Indeed, she never mentioned them. Yet she eviscerated Mitt Romney and everything he represents by stunning contrast, by recounting her modest upbringing and reminding her audience that President Obama shared her unassuming roots. It was a bravura political performance cloaked in an apolitical narrative. After Tuesday night, it will be very difficult for the Rush Limbaugh League to accuse the first lady of being unpatriotic, of failing to sufficiently love America. From her introduction by one of the nation's military supermoms -- Elaine Brye, mother of four military officers -- Obama spoke of schoolteachers, of firefighters, of wounded warriors and their sacrifices. Given Romney's failure in his convention speech to even acknowledge men and women in uniform, Obama's salute to them was another striking contrast, served up without venom or bile. From their first presidential campaign, Michelle Obama's role has been at least as difficult to navigate as her husband's. As the first black woman to represent the country in a job with few defined duties but generations of cherished symbolism, she has had to endure relentless vicious attacks. She has been caricatured, as she has noted, as an ""angry black woman."" She has been cast as hostile to whites. And her campaign against childhood obesity has earned cruel denunciations from the right, including a remark from an overweight GOP lawmaker that she has a ""large posterior."" She has had to suffer through that privately, never shedding her calm exterior in public. She has had to shield her children from scrutiny and attempt to ensure they enjoy something close to normality. And she has had to carve out an official portfolio of suitable causes. But she has done all that with aplomb, racking up an enviable approval rating. If she was once a reluctant political wife, she seemed Tuesday night to have found a way to enjoy her role. She was relaxed and confident. She was warm and approachable. (She was also lovely. That shouldn't matter, but it does. Just ask any woman in the national political spotlight.) Opinion: Will Michelle Obama's speech change history? She wove a narrative thread around her insecurities about how the pressures of life in the White House might change her husband and her family. And she delivered a resounding assurance that the president remains not only loving and compassionate but also grounded in honesty and integrity. He can make the tough calls. ""Well, today, after so many struggles and triumphs and moments that have tested my husband in ways I never could have imagined, I have seen firsthand that being president doesn't change who you are -- it reveals who you are."" In a speech full of great lines, that was my favorite. If Romney is a congenital flip-flopper whose views shift with the political winds, Obama's character has already been revealed, she noted without rancor or even explicit comparison. ""And I've seen how the issues that come across a president's desk are always the hard ones -- the problems where no amount of data or numbers will get you to the right answer ... the judgment calls where the stakes are so high, and there is no margin for error,"" she said. Rarely have I heard a political speech that so deftly hit all the right notes and so stirringly found all the right chords. Opinion: Michelle Obama has redefined black women . She deftly deflected Republican accusations of class envy: . ""Our families weren't asking for much. They didn't begrudge anyone else's success or care that others had much more than they did. ... In fact, they admired it."" But she also noted that Democrats don't believe in Ayn Rand's hyperindividualism. ""We learned about gratitude and humility -- that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean ... and we were taught to value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect."" This was red meat served up in a bed of lovely salad greens from Obama's garden. Who could argue that wasn't a fitting entree from a First Lady? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Tucker.","Cynthia Tucker: It would be tough for critics to paint Michelle Obama as angry, aggrieved .

"(CNN) -- The mother of Jhessye Shockley -- a young Arizona girl last seen 11 months ago -- was arrested and charged Thursday with murder in her daughter's case, authorities said. A grand jury indicted Jerice Hunter on Thursday and, later that day, she was arrested ""without incident"" around 1:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) at her home in Mesa, Arizona, Glendale interim police Chief Debora Black said. ""We are confident, with the indictment and arrest of Jerice Hunter today, we will achieve our ... goal of securing justice for Jhessye,"" Black told reporters. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery noted that Hunter faces two charges: felony child abuse and first-degree murder. Police believe 5-year-old's body was dumped in trash . Hunter had said her daughter Jhessye, then 5 years old, wandered out of the family's Glendale home on October 11. The girl went unnoticed by her 13-, 9- and 6-year-old siblings, who were supposed to be watching her, according to her mother. Jhessye hasn't been seen since, and while authorities long ago opened a homicide investigation, her body hasn't been found. The girl's mother came under suspicion early in the investigation, and she spent a week behind bars in November 2011 after being arrested for alleged child abuse. Police said reports from the girl's siblings led them to believe Hunter had abused Jhessye. Late last year, Glendale Police Department spokeswoman Tracey Breeden called Hunter ""our primary focus"" in the investigation. But while Breeden insisted then ""we're getting closer to solving the case,"" no further arrests were made at the time. The mother's attorney, Scott Maasen, said late last year that Hunter ""certainly declares her innocence."" Maasen said his client's children were playing in the backyard behind their apartment complex when Hunter went out to a store. When she came back, she found that her daughter was missing, the lawyer said. ""She's been steadfast in every conversation we've had,"" said Maasen, who has accused authorities of ""stonewalling"" and failing to share information with his client. ""She wants to find Jhessye, wants to know where her daughter is."" Mom Begs for Missing 5-Year-Old's Return at Rally . In a press release issued last December, Glendale police said they believe the girl's body was dumped in a trash bin in nearby Tempe ""prior to the report of Jhessye's disappearance on October 11."" Trash from the location is taken to a transfer station and ultimately to Butterfield Station Landfill, police said. Some 280 law enforcement officers from 13 agencies went through 9,500 tons of trash, but ended their search weeks ago without finding any sign of Jhessye, Black said Thursday. The police chief added that there are no plans to look further for the girl. ""We believe that Jhessye is at her final resting place at the Butterfield Station Landfill,"" Black said. ""There's nothing to be gained by continuing to search."" After that search was finished, police and the Maricopa County Attorney's office worked together in preparing a case, which they then presented to a grand jury. Montgomery, the county attorney, said the fact authorities haven't found Jhessye's body didn't prove to be an impediment in securing an indictment nor did he expect it would prevent a jury from convicting Hunter. Black, police chief for the city of about 225,000 just northwest of Phoenix, acknowledged the toll Jhessye's disappearance has taken on residents, grief and frustration that now may be tempered with Hunter's arrest. ""Our hope is that the announcement today will allow the healing process to begin for everyone who knew Jhessye, who loved Jhessye and all those who have been touched by her story,"" she said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The promoter for Michael Jackson's comeback concerts expressed doubts about the star's ability to be ready for the shows but expressed confidence in the private doctor eventually convicted in Jackson's death, according to e-mails published in Sunday's Los Angeles Times. AEG Live President Randy Phillips was responding to ""This Is It"" director Kenny Ortega's e-mail, which said Jackson had ""strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior"" and suggesting they hire a ""top Psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP."" Jackson died on June 25, 2009, from what the Los Angeles County coroner ruled was an overdose of a surgical anesthetic and sedatives, drugs that Dr. Conrad Murray told police he used to help the entertainer sleep as he prepared for the concerts set to start two weeks later. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison last year. The e-mails, leaked to the newspaper, were gathered for an insurance company's lawsuit, which seeks to void a $17.5 million policy that AEG Live purchased in case Jackson was not able to perform the 50 shows scheduled for London's O2 Arena. The newspaper did not disclose the source of the leaks. Lloyds of London contends AEG Live hid Jackson's health problems from the insurer and failed to respond to repeated requests for his medical history. Katherine Jackson explains disappearance . While Phillips called Jackson's death ""a terrible tragedy"" in an e-mail weeks after he died, he added ""but life must go on."" ""AEG will make a fortune from merch sales, ticket retention, the touring exhibition and the film/dvd,"" Phillips wrote. In fact, AEG Live was allowed to sell Jackson tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary ""This Is It,"" produced from rehearsal video. AEG Live and its lawyer did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The e-mails suggest AEG Live's president saw Jackson's problems first hand the day the pop star was to appear at the O2 Arena to publicly announce the shows. ""MJ is locked in his room drunk and despondent,"" Phillips wrote in a March 5, 2009, e-mail to AEG Live's parent company, the paper reported. ""I (am) trying to sober him up."" ""I screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking,"" Phillips wrote. ""He is an emotionally paralyzed mess riddled with self loathing and doubt now that it is show time."" The promoter blamed London traffic when Jackson was 90 minutes late for the announcement that day. ""He's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever,"" Phillips told CNN two months later to refute reports Jackson's health was threatening the concerts. The Los Angeles Times story, however, said the e-mails indicated major doubts about Jackson's ability to perform. ""We cannot be forced into stopping this, which MJ will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants,"" AEG Live executive Paul Gongaware e-mailed to Phillips. Jackson's missed rehearsals in June triggered concerns in e-mails that he was slow in learning his dance routines and would have to lip-sync on stage, the newspaper reported. ""MJ is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time,"" one e-mail from the show's music director read, the paper reported. A production manager wrote: ""He was a basket case. Doubt is pervasive."" Despite 'Unity' concert, family in uproar . A loud warning from Ortega, who worked closely with Jackson on previous tours, came in mid-June, just over a week before his death. ""It is like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state,"" Ortega wrote. ""I believe we need professional guidance in this matter."" Ortega testified at Murray's trial about his concerns about Jackson's frail condition and missed rehearsals. It resulted in a meeting six days before Jackson's death in which Murray assured the promoters he would have Jackson ready for rehearsals that next week. An e-mail from Phillips after that meeting said he had confidence in Murray ""who I am gaining immense respect for as I get to deal with him more."" ""This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig, so he (is) totally unbiased and ethical,"" Phillips' e-mail said. Murray seeks new test in MJ's death . The correspondence could play a role in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jackson's heirs against AEG, which accuses the promoter of contributing to his death by pressuring him to prepare for the concerts despite his weak condition. A lawyer for Jackson's mother and a spokesman for Jackson's estate declined to comment on the e-mails reported in the newspaper. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Sunday's Los Angeles Times reveals internal e-mails from ""This Is It"" promoter .

"(CNN) -- Police say they are searching for 16-year-old Kara Alongi, a missing New Jersey girl who generated big buzz on social media with a post about a possible intruder. ""There is somone in my hour ecall 911,"" she posted on Twitter at 6:20 p.m. Sunday before she went missing. It is believed she meant ""someone in my house, call 911."" The comment spawned a flurry of activity on the social networking site, with thousands using the hashtag, #helpfindkara. The girl's Twitter account had also netted nearly 100,000 followers by mid Monday.

"(CNN) -- As Mitt Romney prepares to make the case for a first term, give a thought to what we can expect from a Barack Obama second term. It's probably going to look a lot like the second terms of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon -- driven not by his own agenda, but by events beyond his control. Bush's second term was defined by the after-effects of the Iraq decision he made in his first term; Clinton's by impeachment and the Internet boom; Reagan's by deficits and Gorbachev; Nixon's by Watergate. And what will define Obama's? 1) Republicans will hold at least one House of Congress, maybe two. 2) The U.S. economy will continue to mend, as the financial crisis recedes into the past. 3) Unless forcibly prevented, Iran will enrich enough uranium for multiple nuclear weapons sometime before 2017. 4) Natural gas production will continue to surge. Prediction 1 implies that there will be no bold Obama legislative agenda in a second term. The votes just won't be there. The second-term Obama agenda will have to be executed through agency action and executive order. And he'll have lots of opportunities via the big laws passed in his first term: the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, and so on. Critics often talk about how long these laws are. Yet however long the enactment, the text of a complex modern statute is only the very roughest guide to its future operation. The crucial operating decisions are made by presidential appointees, supervised by the courts. Congress drafts, but the administrators fill in the details - and the details, as the saying goes, are where the devil lurks. A re-elected President Obama will have large powers to reshape the health industry and financial services -- not with some dramatic law, but with a thousand undramatic lower-level edicts that cumulatively can redefine a law in ways never imagined by its authors. Politics: Reggie Love -- Obama leads like he plays . But there is one agreement that the president and Congress will have to reach: over future taxes and budgets. The Bush tax cuts of 2001, extended in 2010, will expire at the end of 2012. The president has said he would allow those tax cuts to lapse, at least for high income levels. Republicans are determined to preserve them. Who'll blink? On past precedent, you might guess that the president will. But the president knows that people expect him to blink -- which may inspire him to hang much, much tougher. 2) Recovery comes much more slowly from recessions caused by financial crises, according to the authors of the best study of the subject, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. Yet if recovery comes slowly, it does come eventually. By 2015, the U.S. economy should be reaching normal growth and fuller employment. Deficits will begin to shrink; the country's present desperate mood will abate. And Republicans and Democrats will furiously argue over who deserves the credit, as they still argue over who deserves credit for the 1990s boom. We also saw in the 2000s, however, that employment can grow strongly without generating very much in the way of wage increases for most working people. The U.S. economy added almost 2 million jobs in 2004, more than 2 million in 2005, about 1.7 million in 2006, and more than 700,000 in 2007. Yet the median wage as of the end of 2007 still had not caught up to its 2000 peak, adjusting for inflation. In the post-2009 recovery, almost all the income growth has been captured by the most affluent few. President Obama may deplore that trend, but he seems to have no very clear idea of how to alter it. 3) U.S.-led sanctions and Israeli-led sabotage have slowed the Iranian nuclear program. Few experts expect that these non-belligerent means will work indefinitely. What then? Israel could attack Iran. The United States could hit even harder. But suppose -- as seems most likely -- that both allies flinch from war. Then the U.S. and Israel will confront a radically reshaped Middle East, one in which America's friends will be weaker and more fearful and Iran will be more assertive and intransigent. The president's hopes of reconciling the Islamic and Western worlds -- of midwifing a Palestinian state -- and of finishing off jihadist terrorism will all bump into the reality of an emboldened Iran and depleted American prestige. 4) Second terms tend to bring disappointments, but one huge success seems to be gathering for whoever happens to occupy the White House over the next four years: the advent of that long promised goal, energy independence. The surge in natural gas production in the United States, the full development of the massive oil sand resource in Canada, could make North America the world's fastest-growing energy region in the years ahead and put the continent on the way to self-sufficiency by 2020. It won't have quite happened yet by 2017, but the achievement will at least be visible on the near horizon. It will be a strange irony of history if the president of hope and change left office as the president who presided over the greatest surge in domestic fossil fuel production since the 1930s. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: A second term for Barack Obama would have a different shape .
He says Dems likely won't control both houses, giving him little chance for major legislation .
Frum: Obama would likely benefit from an improving economy but would face challenges overseas .

"(CNN) -- Here are the top five things that occurred in the ongoing civil war in Syria on Wednesday that you need to know: . 1. The Syrian city of Maarat Nouman, a strategic link between Damascus and the cities of Homs, Aleppo, Latakiya and Tartus, is the latest flashpoint in the conflict, according to activists and opposition groups. After members of the Free Syrian Army gained control of the city Tuesday, following a two-day battle, the Syrian army bombarded the city of 150,000 Wednesday, activist Ahmad El-Khalaf told CNN from the outskirts of the city. Heavy clashes between government troops and the FSA at checkpoints just outside Maarat Nouman continued Thursday morning, the opposition The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Syrian forces fired long-range heavy artillery at targets in Maarat Nouman early Thursday, the coordination committees said. About 200 rebel fighters attacked a military convoy heading to Maarat Nouman on Wednesday, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Across Syria, 197 people, including women and children, died Wednesday, the Local Coordination Committees said. Most of the dead were in Damascus. One rebel commander was killed as rebel groups clashed with government troops on the Damascus-Aleppo International Highway, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Regime shells began raining down on neighborhoods of Khalidiya, Jouret Shiyah and Homs old city. Syrian state TV also reported Wednesday that a state TV cameraman, Mohammed Al-Ashram, was ""killed by terrorist gunfire in Deir Ezzor."" Al-Assad routinely blames terrorists for the violence in Syria, but activists say his forces are behind the brutality. 2. A Syrian plane that originated in Moscow was forced to land in Ankara on Wednesday after suspicions it was carrying equipment that violated civil aviation rules, Turkish media reported. After an extensive search, authorities confiscated some of the items on board, the Anadolu news agency reported. The plane was allowed to leave early Thursday with its passengers, but the suspicious materials were kept for further investigation, the news agency said. 3. Syrian novelist Samar Yazbek, who risked her life to document her countrymen's suffering, won the prestigious PEN Pinter International Writer of Courage Award. Her memoir, ""A Woman in the Crossfire: Diaries of the Syrian Revolution,"" chronicles the first months of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Yazbek writes about standing at a rally and seeing a man next to her shot down by a sniper. She recalls trying to save a fleeing boy who was orphaned when his parents were taken by police because they were protesting. Well known in her country before the civil war, Yazbek is also an Alawite, the same sect as the Assad family. For taking a position against al-Assad, her family disowned her. She dedicated her book to ""the martyrs of the Syrian revolution"" and ""those who move among the downpour of bullets and artillery fire, the tanks and the fighter jets, in order to carry on the revolution of the Syrian people toward establishing a free and democratic society."" Read excerpts of the book and a profile of Yazbek . 4. The New York Times reported Wednesday that the U.S. military has secretly sent a task force of more than 150 planners and other specialists to Jordan to help Jordanian troops deal with an estimated 180,000 Syrian refugees. CNN reported in May that the United States sent troops to Jordan for a training exercise called Eager Lion. The troops are part of a joint special operations group of about 150  that has been in and out of Jordan regularly. U.S. special forces have, since April, been working on a variety of potential scenarios in Jordan including border protection, securing chemical weapons in Syria, and debriefing defectors, CNN's Barbara Starr has reported. The group is also offering advice on humanitarian relief and corridors. A senior official from the Jordanian Armed Forces on Wednesday denied media reports about the presence of U.S. forces in the country helping handle refugees. The official said that the Jordanians could handle ""any kind of future threats."" 5. Al-Assad finally replaced Nawaf al-Fares, Syria's ambassador to Iraq, who defected July 11. The state-run news agency SANA reported that the former ambassador was ""relieved of his duties"" after he ""made press statements that contradict the duties of his position of defending the country's stances."" Syria's new ambassador to Iraq, Sattam Jad'an al-Dandah, was sworn in Tuesday and al-Assad wished him well, SANA reported. Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the situation in Syria has ""dramatically worsened."" ""It is causing serious risks to the stability of Syria's neighbors and the entire region,"" he said. ""The escalation of the conflict, along the Syrian-Turkish border and the impact of the crisis on Lebanon are extremely dangerous. This is a regional calamity with global ramifications. I am deeply concerned by the continued flow of arms to both the Syrian government and opposition forces. ""I urge again those countries providing arms to stop doing so,"" he said. ""Militarization only aggravates the situation."" The Syrian Ministry of Foreign and Emigrants Affairs responded by saying that Syria has tried twice before to issue cease-fires that did not work. An official statement accused Ban of presenting ""only half of the truth.""

He had been in police custody since being arrested on suspicion of abduction Tuesday. He will appear before magistrates in Aberystwyth on Monday morning, Jenkins said. ""I realize that this is an incredibly difficult time for April's family, friends and the community,"" he added. Superintendent Ian John, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said that the force remained ""totally focused and committed"" to finding April. Specialist police search teams have been scouring building in and around Machynlleth, as well as the surrounding mountainous and wooded countryside and a nearby flooded river. Hundreds of local volunteers who had been helping police in the hunt were asked to leave the search to the professionals as it became apparent that it was now a murder inquiry. April's mother made an emotional appeal earlier this week for information leading to her daughter. She was taken from a street near her home as she played on her bicycle with a friend. Chief Constable Jackie Roberts said the investigation had been ""one of the most complex and fast moving"" in the history of the police force. She also paid tribute to the efforts of local residents who had rallied round to try to help the little girl. Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this week said the abduction was ""every parent's nightmare.""

"New York (CNN) -- A collection of 46 never-before-seen photos from The Beatles' first concerts in the United States was auctioned off for more than $350,000 at a New York auction house on Wednesday. The evening's biggest sellers included a close-up of John Lennon and Paul McCartney singing into a microphone, which sold for $30,000 and an image of the four Beatles shot from behind, which went for $68,500. The auction, held at Christie's in Manhattan, was expected to bring in about $100,000, but the grand total ended up being $361,938. The Washington, D.C.-based photographer behind the show was 18 when he took the photos. Mike Mitchell, who is now 65, said that the thought of someday auctioning off the photos for such a large sum had never crossed his mind as a rookie photographer vying for a press pass to see the Fab Four. ""Nobody knew where The Beatles would go,"" he said. ""They kind of marched and everybody fell in step behind them."" When Mitchell heard The Beatles were making their first trip across the Atlantic, he managed to get a press pass from a magazine he worked for. ""I had realized that the camera was really a ticket to a lot of places one might not be able to go otherwise,"" he said. Some of the photos that were auctioned off were taken on Feb. 11, 1964, at the Washington Coliseum -- The Beatles' first concert in the United States. The others were taken at the Baltimore Civic Center in September of that year. Mitchell chose the 46 photos to be auctioned from about 450 negatives that had been collecting dust since the 1964 concerts. He chose group shots, close-ups and even photos without any faces. One of his favorite photos is an image of Ringo Starr's jeweled hands. Another is a photo of one of The Beatles' boots on a stage littered with jelly beans. Mitchell had to scan and restore the photos for the auction. ""I had to remove all the dust and scratches that had accumulated over that time,"" he said. He decided to release the photos because ""it was time,"" he said. Cathy Elkies, director of iconic collections at Christie's, said she was nervous going into the auction because Mitchell was a relatively unknown name, but that the photographs and their subjects spoke for themselves. ""They are beautiful, they are intimate, they are evocative,"" she said. ""And the fact that he was 18 just is really a very sobering idea."" And the fact that the photos had never been seen added to the success of the auction, Elkies said. ""Beatles fans just think they've seen it all so to have the opportunity to bring something to market that was never seen before was great,"" she said.","The biggest sellers include a close-up of John Lennon and Paul McCartney .

"(CNN) -- Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni guided India to a second Cricket World Cup title on Saturday as his team beat tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka by six wickets in the final in Mumbai. Dhoni, the world's highest-paid player, produced his best performance of the six-week-long event when it mattered most as India passed Sri Lanka's total of 274-6 with 10 balls of the allotted 50 overs to spare. The 29-year-old smashed the winning runs with a huge six over the boundary ropes to finish the innings unbeaten on 91 off only 79 balls faced. He set up victory with his fourth-wicket partnership of 109 with Gautam Gambhir, who top-scored with an invaluable 97, after coming to the batting crease at 114-3 in the 22nd over. Duel of the cricket demi-gods . Sri Lanka, winners of the tournament in 1996 and runners-up in the last staging four years ago, set a potentially testing target for India thanks to an unbeaten 103 from captain Mahela Jayawardene. With the victory, India -- the top-ranked team in cricket's five-day Test format -- assumed the No. 1 position in the limited-overs game ahead of previous champions Australia. It was a successful farewell for India's South African coach Gary Kirsten, who is ending his four-year tenure. The final, the first between two Asian teams in the tournament's 36-year history, was billed as a battle between two of the game's greatest players: India batsman Sachin Tendulkar and his fellow record-setter, bowler Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka. When cricket means more than just a match . However, the 37-year-old Tendulkar made only 18 after opening the Indian innings, meaning that the world's highest run-scorer in all formats of the game finished second in this tournament behind Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan -- who added 33 for an overall total of 500 runs from nine innings. However, he had the satisfaction of earning his first World Cup win in his sixth appearance at the tournament since 1992, playing on his home ground where he made his first-class debut for Bombay with a century at the age of 15. ""I couldn't have asked for more,"" Tendulkar told the crowd after being carried around the Wankhede Stadium on the shoulders of his teammates. ""Winning the World Cup is the ultimate thing. It is the proudest moment of my life. It shows it is never too late. I thank my teammates, who were fabulous. I could not really hold back my tears. These are happy tears so I don't mind crying."" Muralitharan, playing his final match before retiring, was unable to add to his 15 wickets in the tournament as he was visibly hampered by the injuries that threatened to rule him out of the match. Murali, who turns 39 next month, ended his career with a record 800 Test and 534 one-day wickets. India's Zaheer Khan picked up two more wickets to join Shahid Afridi as the tournament's leading bowler on 21, having played one more match after his team beat Pakistan in the semifinals on Wednesday. Sri Lanka won the pre-match toss of the coin and chose to bat first, but needed late fireworks from Jayawardene -- who scored his runs off only 88 balls -- plus Nuwan Kulasekara (32) and Thisara Perera (22) after a mid-innings dip. Fast bowler Lasith Malinga gave Sri Lanka hope when he dismissed both Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag (0) but Gambhir added 83 with Virat Kohli (35) to steady the run chase. Dhoni then upped the scoring rate, and India appeared to be cruising until Gambhir attempted a rash shot in sight of his 10th one-day century and was bowled by Perera. That left India needing 52 to win off 54 balls, but Dhoni turned the tide again when he hit the first six of India's innings off Perera -- and then survived an appeal for a run out that required several replays before the video umpire made his ruling. Dhoni was given able assistance by Yuvraj Singh, who ended the game unbeaten on 21 from 24 balls and was later named man of the tournament for his consistent displays with bat and ball.","Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni smashes winning runs for India with huge six .

"(CNN)  -- Caroline Wozniacki has moved within one win of reclaiming her world number one ranking with victory over Japanese qualifier Ayumi Morita in the third round of the Dubai tennis championships. The Danish top seed eased past her 57-ranked opponent 6-1 6-0 on Thursday and could regain the world number one spot she lost to Australian Open champion Kim Clijsters if she makes the semifinal of the hard-court tournament. Clijsters -- who chose not to play in the Middle East this week -- leapfrogged 20-year-old Wozniacki into the number one spot when she reached the semifinals of the Paris Open last week, but failed to cement her position when she lost in the final to Petra Kvitova. Shahar Peer of Israel is now the only obstacle left for Wozniacki to conquer in her bid to regain top spot, after the ninth seed came back from a set down to beat Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer 3-6 6-4 6-1. Wozniacki lost to Peer in last year's tournament. CNN blog: Can Murray become a grand slam champ? ""I knew how Ayumi was going to play today. She has had a good week so I was really pleased about winning today,"" Wozniacki told the official WTA website. ""Against Shahar I just need to stay positive and try to play like I did today. If I play well, the ranking will come automatically - for me, I'm just focused on going out there tomorrow and playing my best. That's all I can do."" Meanwhile, number two seed and world number three Vera Zvonareva made a shock exit as she lost to fifteenth seed Alisa Kleybanova. World number 22 Kleybanova won the all-Russian affair 6-3 6-2, to set up a last four clash with Italian number 11 seed Flavia Pennetta, who overcame Belarussian seventh seed Victoria Azarenka  6-3 6-7(2) 6-4. Third seed Francesca Schiavone was also an early casualty. The Italian faced Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova in a repeat of their recent record-breaking encounter in Melbourne, but in a reversal of fortunes it was Kuznetsova who triumphed 1-6 6-0 7-5. The double grand slam champion and former world number three will next face Polish number nine seed Agnieszka Radwanska, who easily beat former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli of France 6-3 6-2. French Open runner-up Sam Stosur also made the last four after a 6-3 6-4 win over Switzerland's Patti Schnyder. The Australian fourth seed will face sixth seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, after she beat Kaia Kanepi of Estonia 2-6 6-3 7-5. Elsewhere, at the men's ATP Tour event in Marseille, France, second seed and world number six Tomas Berdych made it through to the quarterfinals with a victory over French world number 122 Edouard Roger-Vasselin. The 2010 Wimbledon finalist will play Croatia's Marin Cilic for a place in the semifinals, after former world number nine defeated Germany's Philipp Petzschner 7-6(3) 6-3.

"(CNN) -- The United States accused Sudan of targeting civilians in recent airstrikes, including one that destroyed a Bible school in South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly-created independent country of South Sudan. ""The United States strongly condemns the bombing by the Sudanese Armed Forces of civilian populations in Southern Kordofan,"" a White House statement said. ""Aerial attacks on civilian targets are unjustified and unacceptable. Such attacks are a violation of international law and compound the ongoing crisis in these areas."" The Sudanese government could not be immediately reached for comment, but has said in the past that it is targeting rebels in the area. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area near the Bible school Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, American evangelist Franklin Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Bible college buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement . No injuries were reported. ""It was a miracle that no one was injured,"" the statement added. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005. But before South Sudan gained independence in July of last year, human rights monitors expressed concerns that longstanding grievances could again lead to violence consuming the region. In November, there were several days of bombings near an entry point for refugees at the border, the United Nations reported. It did not specify who launched the bombs. The White House statement, release Thursday, urged for officials to find others ways to settle the conflict. ""We believe that this conflict can only be resolved by dialogue, not through violence, and we encourage all parties to negotiate a peaceful settlement,"" statement said.","Rev.

"(Rolling Stone) -- ""I went through a few roller coasters,"" says Taylor Swift, reflecting on her relationships over the past two years. She channeled the turmoil into her fourth studio LP, ""Red,"" out October 22. ""Trying to chronicle each step of the way was challenging, because you go to some really dark places with the lyrics. Then in the next track, you're talking about how amazing it is to meet somebody new."" After writing 2010's smash ""Speak Now"" by herself, Swift veered in the opposite direction, co-writing with pop hitmakers such as Max Martin and Adele collaborator Dan Wilson. She wound up with nearly 40 potential songs; in between stops on the yearlong world tour that she wrapped in March, Swift joined her writing partners in L.A. and Nashville. ""I felt like an apprentice,"" Swift says. ""They taught me so much about melodic sense, and they let me do what I love, which is the lyrics."" The result is Swift's most eclectic set ever, ranging from ""State of Grace,"" a howling, U2-style epic with reverb-drenched guitars, to a sweet acoustic duet with U.K. singer Ed Sheeran. Another key track even features a dubstep-inspired bass breakdown. So far, the new direction isn't hurting Swift's career: Lead single ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"" a bitter breakup anthem with a hip-hop-flavored Max Martin beat, has shattered chart records, selling a stunning 623,000 digital singles in its first week. Taylor Swift to Release New 'Red' Album in October . To Swift, the musical excursions aren't surprising, given how much hip-hop and R&B she listens to. ""I have so many play-lists full of Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown,"" she says. ""I love Wiz Khalifa."" Lyrically, the album is full of Swift's usual themes of romance and heartbreak. ""I know general things about love,"" she says. ""How to treat people well, what you deserve and when to walk away. Other than that, love is a complete mystery -- and that's why I like to write about it."" Taylor Swift: My Fourth Album Is About 'Crash-and-Burn Heartbreak' Swift has spent much of the summer with her new boyfriend, Conor Kennedy (the son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.), in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. She's even looked into buying a house near the Kennedy compound. ""That would be so amazing,"" she says. But Swift won't be resting for long: She's already thinking about how to top her last tour, which featured aerialists, costume changes and a mock wedding onstage every night. ""I really want to go out on the road in the spring,"" she says. ""After I write a song, I always end up laying awake at night thinking, 'What are the lighting cues going to be on this? How big is the pit going to be?' I have been thinking of some big moments that are going to happen.""

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- The spokesman for Nigerian militant group Boko Haram has been captured after a months-long surveillance operation, a spokesman for Nigerian police said Wednesday. Security services tracked Abu Qa Qa through his phone even though he changed his location and phone number regularly, police told CNN. They said they're now trying to confirm his true identity, though they believe that he is a Nigerian citizen. Boko Haram has carried out multiple bombings and shootings across northern Nigeria in recent days. Depending on the faction of the group, Boko Haram's ambitions range from the stricter enforcement of Islamic Sharia law to the destruction of the government. Abu Qa Qa has been instrumental in linking journalists with the militant group and getting its messages out to a wider audience on social media after Boko Haram's long-term shunning of what it deemed to be Western technology. His arrest has provided a much-needed boost to security services, who were criticized for failing to foil the January 20 bombings in Kano, which killed 211 people. The bombings struck eight government sites in the country's second-largest city, leaving the police headquarters and other government buildings in charred ruins. The attacks prompted President Goodluck Jonathan to fire the country's inspector general of police. Boko Haram -- whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege"" -- claimed responsibility for the blasts in a phone call to the Daily Trust, according to journalists at the newspaper. Further criticism of the police response after the Kano bombings came Wednesday from the human rights group Amnesty International. It accused the ""poorly trained and ill-equipped"" police of carrying out extra-judicial killings and other violations in response to Boko Haram's attacks. ""Boko Haram has perpetrated numerous human rights abuses and shows contempt for life, but the security forces have failed to prevent, investigate, prosecute or punish these acts and have often carried out new human rights violations with impunity,"" Amnesty said in a statement. Suspected Boko Haram members who have been rounded up have not been tried, and innocent women and children have been detained to gain information about male relatives suspected of offenses, the group said. ""Investigations into crimes, if they occur, are often inadequate and not intelligence-led,"" Amnesty said. CNN asked the Nigerian government repeatedly for comment on accusations of extra-judicial killings but has received no official response. The accusations have also come from civilians caught up in the police activity. ""We are in a state of fear and turbulence,"" the mother of a missing man and his pregnant wife told CNN in an audio-only interview. She asked not to be identified because she was scared to criticize the government on camera. Neighbors said the couple was at home when security forces opened fire, demanding he let them in. The mother said her son's Quran was scattered and destroyed and she found blood pooled by the bedroom door. Despite repeated requests to authorities, she said, no one has told her where her son and his wife are or whether they are still alive. ""My son is not a member of Boko Haram,"" the mother said. ""Had there been justice, they would have arrested him and paraded him before a court of law. This is a jungle justice."" Boko Haram was formed in 2002 by Islamic preacher Mohammad Yusuf as an outgrowth of ethnic tensions in the country in the 1990s. Nigeria's population is split between mostly Muslims living in the north and predominantly Christians in the south. Yusuf advocated the institution of Sharia law throughout the northern states and opposed democracy. The group operated openly from northeastern Nigeria and staged small-scale attacks against government targets. In 2009, Nigerian police forces moved to crack down on Boko Haram. Harsh police tactics led to an armed uprising and the arrest of Yusuf, who later died in police custody. His death spurred the group to begin its attacks on police stations. Ensuing clashes between group members and the police killed hundreds.","NEW: Amnesty International accuses police of extra-judicial killings .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's foreign minister on Thursday called the attempted assassination of a teenage activist who pushed against extremists and in support of women's rights and education ""a wake-up call (to) a clear-and-present danger."" Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar spoke to CNN's Christiane Amanpour two days after Malala Yousufzai, 14, was gunned down as she headed home from school in Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley. The girl was in critical condition Thursday at a military hospital outside Islamabad after surgeons removed a bullet lodged in her neck. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for targeting Malala, who enraged the militant group by writing about her daily battle with extremists who used fear and intimidation to force girls to stay at home instead of going to school. Malala's online writing earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize in November. Read more: 14-year-old girl wins Pakistan's first peace prize . The Taliban have vowed to kill the teenager if she survives. According to Khar, people in Pakistan and all over the world must confront those ""who choose to use violence ... to follow whatever they consider to be their agenda."" While noting Pakistan's previous military efforts in the Swat Valley, the foreign minister said the teenage girl's shooting may force even more decisive action between two scenarios -- one that includes rights for women as represented by Malala and ""the other ... trying to be imposed by this particular band (of) extremists."" ""Today, for (Pakistan), it could be, possibly be a turning point,"" she said. ""I would keep my fingers crossed on that."" Education a focus on International Day of the Girl . Malala is suffering from severe cerebral edema, or swelling of the brain, said Lt. Col. Junaid Khan, the head of neurosurgery at the Peshawar hospital. Her uncle, Faiz Muhammad, said his niece hadn't been conscious or responsive in the more than 24 hours after the surgery to remove the bullet. Muhammad, who is at the hospital with Malala, said the family is ""very worried"" about her condition. ""We are counting on all the prayers of the nation,"" he said. ""The prayers are with us, so, God willing, everything is going to be fine."" When Taliban gunmen stopped the van carrying Malala and two other girls Tuesday, they asked which one was Malala Yousufzai. When the girls pointed her out, the men fired, striking all three girls. The two others were not seriously injured in the attack. Opinion: Cowards shot this brave girl . A day later, police took the van driver and another person into custody for questioning. They said they had identified the culprits, but had been arrested. Khar added Thursday that there's been significant law enforcement activity beyond that, saying about 100 people have been arrested on suspicions of ""colluding"" with the attackers. The foreign minister noted, too, that Pakistani authorities offered additional protection prior to the shooting, but Malala's family had turned it down. The Taliban itself issued a statement Thursday defending the attempted killing on religious grounds, saying anyone who ""campaigns against Islam and Sharia (Muslim law) is ordered to be killed by Sharia."" The Taliban denied targeting the teen activist because of her demands for an education. ""That's absolutely wrong, and a propaganda of media,"" the group said. ""Malala is targeted because of her pioneer role in preaching secularism and so-called enlightened moderation."" The Taliban accused Malala of ""playing a vital role in bucking up"" the Pakistani government and ""inviting Muslims to hate mujahedeen."" Khar, Pakistan's foreign minister, said Malala's shooting -- and the Taliban's justification for it -- has been ""rejected by all Pakistanis."" The assassination attempt has also stirred furor abroad. Former U.S. first lady Laura Bush, for instance, hailed Malala as an inspiration.

""We must speak up before these acts occur, work to ensure that they do not happen again, and keep our courage to continue to resist the ongoing cruelty and barbarism of the Taliban,"" Bush said, writing in the Washington Post on Wednesday. ""Malala Yousufzai refused to look the other way. We owe it to her courage and sacrifice to do the same."" The singer Madonna said, during a Wednesday night concert in Los Angeles, that Malala's story made her cry and exclaimed, ""Support education! Support women!""

""This song is for you, Malala,"" she said, and then sang ""Human Nature."" Opinion: Make schools safe for girls everywhere . Malala wrote about her life in Swat Valley, a hotbed of militant activity. The valley near the Afghanistan border once attracted tourists to Pakistan's only ski resort, as well as visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. But that was before militants -- their faces covered with dark turbans -- unleashed a wave of violence. They demanded veils for women, beards for men and a ban on music and television. They allowed boys' schools to operate but closed those for girls. International Day of the Girl: Advice from leading women . It was in this climate that Malala reached out to the outside world through her blog posts. ""I have the right of education,"" Malala said in a CNN interview last year. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" Malala also encouraged other young people to take a stand against the Taliban -- and to not hide in their bedrooms. ""God will ask you on the day of judgment where were you when your people were asking you, when your school fellows were asking you, and when your school was asking you (why) I am being blown up.""

"Botulinum in its purest form is a deadly poison, but it can help stroke victims with pain. Botox is considered a poison with a purpose. Millions of Americans use it to help smooth their wrinkles. As more people use Botox as the ultimate wrinkle remover, doctors are realizing that its benefits go far deeper than the skin. Now it's being used to help stroke victims. A study showing these benefits was released in October 2005. What is Botox? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent: Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin type A. It's produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. In its purest form, botulinum is one of the deadliest poisons known to humans. It can cause death by paralysis. What does Botox do? Gupta: In 1989, long before physicians injected Botox into faces to smooth wrinkles, the FDA approved it for patients with debilitating neurological diseases such as dystonia. In these conditions, faulty connections between brain and muscle cause parts of the body to spasm. Muscles are locked into uncomfortable, often excruciating, positions. Amazingly, Botox liberated many of these patients by actually chemically allowing their muscles to relax. On a basic level, that is what's happening with Botox for wrinkles -- the muscle is loosening its grip on facial skin. This ability to stop the brain from triggering the muscle malfunction led researchers to use Botox for a whole host of other conditions. Up to four in 10 stroke survivors suffer from spastic disability. You may recognize it as stiffness on one side of the body, often seen in a club-like hand or foot. These people lose their independence -- the ability to wash themselves, to eat, even walk. Botox has been used for years in these stroke patients in combination with physical therapy. It allows some of them to gain back mobility and function in their muscles. Is Botox the perfect solution? Gupta: Botox isn't a cure-all. It can have minor side effects and more studies need to be done on long-term use. But for many patients, Botox provides the muscle relief that will allow them to better move their muscles. Does it matter how much time lapses between the stroke and the patient getting Botox treatment? This is definitely a case where the sooner the patient can receive the treatment, the better, so that they can regain mobility and function of their muscles.",Bottom Line: Botox can help stroke victims ease a painful side effect .
"Washington (CNN) -- The Washington Nationals -- the upstarts battling for a playoff spot -- ended the season of its star pitcher to keep him healthy for next year. Stephen Strasburg made his last appearance of the 2012 season Friday, team spokesman John Dever confirmed to CNN. Debate has raged in baseball over the rare move, particularly because the National League-East leading Nationals appear headed to a division title and a post-season berth. The 24-year-old right-hander returned to the mound this season after ""Tommy John"" surgery on his right elbow. The Nationals said they would limit him to roughly 160 innings for the year to keep him from reinjuring his pitching arm. Manager Davey Johnson made good on the promise after Strasburg's rough outing Friday night against the Miami Marlins. A start Wednesday against the New York Mets was supposed to be Strasburg's final appearance this year. The pitcher finished the season with a 15-6 record, 197 strikeouts and a 3.16 ERA.

"AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (CNN) -- The nationalities of the people killed in the Turkish Airlines plane crash near Amsterdam's main airport have been identified as five Turks and four U.S. citizens. Masked investigators work at the crash site Thursday. Among the dead were two Boeing employees, among four onboard the flight, their company said late Thursday in a posting on its Web site. A third was hospitalized, and a fourth employee's fate was not yet known, the company said. None of their identities have been released. Investigators were trying to determine what caused the crash of the aircraft, a model with a good safety record flown by a well-respected airline at one of the world's most modern airports. The crash split the plane into three parts, as it was arriving at Schiphol from Istanbul, Turkey, around 10:40 a.m. (4:40 a.m. ET). Flight 1951 went down in a farmer's field about 500 yards short of the runway in favorable weather conditions. It had 135 people onboard. Among those injured in the crash, 63 remained hospitalized Thursday, six of them in critical condition, said Theo Weterings, the mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality, where Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is located. Another 25 passengers were severely injured, an official said Tuesday. Authorities have confirmed the nationalities of all but 15 of the passengers and crew, Weterings said. Those on board the flight included 53 Dutch, 51 Turkish, seven Americans, three Britons, and one each from Germany, Bulgaria, Finland, and Taiwan.  Watch crash survivors return home » . ""I want to express my deepest sympathies again to the victims of TK flight 1951,"" Weterings said. One week ago, an employees' union accused Turkish Airlines of ""inviting disaster"" by ignoring aircraft maintenance, it emerged Thursday. The Turkish Civil Aviation Union alleged on its Web site on February 18 that Turkish Airlines ""is ignoring the most basic function of flight safety, which is plane maintenance services."" ""The company administration does not understand the consequences of ripping people from their jobs and inviting a disaster."" The union, which represents 12,000 Turkish Airline employees, is involved in an ugly dispute with the company's management.  Watch how survivors described crash » . Turkish Airlines posted a statement on its Web site on Thursday saying it takes safety seriously and that it followed all ""maintenance procedures of the plane manufacturer, national and international authorities directives"" for the plane. Two days before the crash, the company statement said, the pilot of the plane reported failure with the ""Master Caution Light"" while taxiing. The part was replaced, and ""after this replacement, the plane had eight take-offs and landings and there were no problems,"" Turkish Airlines said. In the wake of the disaster, Turkish Airlines executives and officials from Turkey's Transportation Ministry said the Boeing 737-800 had last been inspected December 22.   See where 737-800 has been involved in previous incidents » . ""There was no problem with maintenance in the records of the plane,"" Candan Karlicetin, executive board chairman of Turkish Airlines, said in a news conference just hours after the crash. Teams of investigators arrived at the crash site just after daybreak and set up a large white tent. They fanned out over the debris field, where the white fuselage of the Boeing lay in three pieces. A special Turkish Airlines flight landed in Amsterdam Thursday morning from Istanbul, carrying about 70 relatives of those on board the fatal flight. The relatives were accompanied by trauma specialists, the airline said. The flight data and voice recorders were recovered. Turkish officials have also ruled out weather conditions as a possible reason for the crash. Dutch and Turkish authorities say they await the results of an international investigation into the cause. Aviation experts say Turkish Airlines has a relatively good safety record, though in 2003, more then 70 people were killed when a Turkish Airlines domestic flight crashed in fog near the southeastern city of Diyarbakir. Turkey's flagship carrier had been expanding its routes and fleet of aircraft in recent years. Hollywood actor Kevin Costner was recently hired to star in an advertising campaign for the company. Costner's commercials were to be broadcast in 70 countries. An employee in Turkish Airlines' advertising department said the promotional campaign was suspended in the wake of the fatal plane crash.

"(CNN) -- Sometimes life can turn on a dime. Just ask Richard Eggers, a former Wells Fargo employee. The 68-year-old Eggers was fired by the company's home mortgage division in West Des Moines, Iowa, in July for a petty crime he committed nearly 50 years ago. He got caught using a cardboard cutout of a dime to run a laundromat washing machine when he was 19. Officially, the crime is called operating a coin changing machine by false means, court records from 1963 say. ""It was silly and stupid,"" Eggers told CNN affiliate KCCI-TV. ""I am not terribly proud of it, but, it doesn't warrant a termination a half a century later."" Wells Fargo says it's following federal laws laid down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIC). They're designed to weed out employees guilty of identity theft and mortgage fraud. ""Wells Fargo is ... bound by US Federal law ... to protect our customers and their personal financial information from someone who we know has committed an act of dishonesty or breach of trust -- regardless of when the incidents occurred,"" Vickee J. Adams, vice president of external communications, said in a statement. ""It is uncomfortable, but it is a law that we have to follow,"" she said. ""We have the responsibility to avoid hiring or continuing to employ someone who we know has a criminal record."" Wells Fargo says between May 2011 and May 2012, it performed thorough background checks on all its team members, regardless of when they were hired. The screenings were the same as those required for new hires. ""The whole thing was too absurd for words,"" Eggers told KCCI. ""They had their instructions and there was nothing I could change, but I wanted to let them know I didn't accept it as a logical and reasonable business practice."" Wells Fargo says Eggers has been put in touch with an FDIC case manager to work on steps to ""make him eligible for reemployment."" Leonard Bates, an attorney representing Eggers and three other employees who used to work for the company, said he may file a class action lawsuit against Wells Fargo and the FDIC. ""Common sense tells you that Mr. Eggers and his 49-year-old crime was not the downfall of the mortgage industry in 2008 and 2009,"" Bates told KCCI.","The crime was committed nearly 50 years ago, court records show .

"Sen. Edward Kennedy announced in 2008 that he had a brain tumor in his left parietal lobe. Sen. Edward Kennedy announced in May 2008 that he was suffering from a brain tumor, a malignant glioma, in his left parietal lobe. He had surgery at Duke University in June 2008. Is surgery the usual course of treatment to take? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent: Yes, surgery to remove the tumor is common, provided surgeons are able to remove a large part of the tumor and as long as they can avoid causing unacceptable neurologic injury. The goal with surgery to remove a brain tumor is to get as much of the tumor as possible without damaging the key areas of the brain that control speech and motor skills. This was something Kennedy's doctors would have determined prior to surgery by taking MRIs to see how close his tumor is to these key areas. Many people will choose not to operate in fear of losing ability to speak, walk, etc. If the tumor is causing pressure on his brain, they could be doing surgery to remove the tumor. This will reduce some of the side effects he may be experiencing, such as headache, nausea, vomiting or blurred vision. The senator was awake during his surgery. Oftentimes it is that feedback that the patient himself gives that is so crucial: ""squeeze your right hand, Senator; move your right arm,"" that sort of thing. ""Can you say the following word..."" That sort of stuff is very crucial. How common is brain cancer? Gupta: 1.3 percent of all cancers are brain cancers. Twenty thousand cases will be diagnosed in 2008, according to the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute. Fourteen percent will occur in the parietal lobe, which is where Kennedy's tumor is located. The majority of cases occur in patients over the age of 55. How common is it to follow surgery with chemotherapy and radiation? Gupta: Neurosurgeons agree that malignant gliomas are very resilient to treatment. Sometimes, surgery alone is not enough to cure the cancer, because cells from the tumor get too far into the normal surrounding brain tissue. In this instance, surgery combined with radiation therapy and or chemotherapy is often used. There is very well-established evidence that radiation therapy doubles survival in patients with glioblastoma. If he starts radiation following the surgery, it would typically be five days a week for 30 days.","Bottom Line: In cases such as Kennedy's, surgery combined with radiation therapy or chemotherapy or both is often used."
"(CNN) -- Police in Houston, Texas, say they have busted a prostitution ring that may involve more than 1,500 clients, including professional athletes, doctors and lawyers. Investigators were scouring computers files and credit card records on Monday, trying to verify a large client list that could ignite scandals throughout the city, CNN affiliate station KHOU reported. Police arrested alleged ringleaders Deborah Turbiville and her husband, Charlie, as part of a two-year investigation, the affiliate reported. Turbiville called herself the ""Heidi Fleiss of Houston,"" referring to a woman who was dubbed the ""Hollywood Madam"" for providing call girls to famous and wealthy clients, police said. Turbiville, who reportedly recruited prostitutes through the online site Craigslist, was in court Monday on a charge of promotion of prostitution. Investigators said the women met their clients in upscale hotels and charged about $350 an hour, the affiliate reported.

"(Health.com) -- A chemical used in the manufacture of common household products -- such as some food packaging, carpets, paint, and nonstick cookware -- may be associated with an increased risk of heart disease, a new study suggests. The chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), is present in trace amounts in up to 98% of Americans. Previous research has linked PFOA exposure to unhealthy cholesterol levels and other risk factors for heart disease, but the potential health hazards posed by the chemical remain largely unknown. In the new study, which included a nationally representative sample of adults, those with the highest levels of PFOA in their blood had double the odds of having a history of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke, compared to adults with the lowest PFOA levels. The highest PFOA levels also were associated with 78% higher odds of peripheral artery disease, a condition related to heart disease in which the arteries in the limbs narrow and harden. Although these numbers may sound alarming, the researchers say the results should be interpreted with caution. Because the study looked at the relationship between PFOA and heart disease at a single point in time, it doesn't show that PFOA exposure causes -- or even precedes -- heart disease. Health.com: Surprising heart attack risks . The researchers did factor in numerous health and demographic measures (such as race, education, obesity, smoking, and cholesterol), but they emphasize that unknown factors besides PFOA may explain some or all of the association seen in the study. ""What we are finding is that high levels of PFOA and cardiovascular disease coexisted for some reason. That is all,"" says lead author Dr. Anoop Shankar, an epidemiologist at the West Virginia University School of Public Health in Morgantown. ""It is possible that we are seeing something that is just a bystander and is there because of confounding associations."" The study, which was published this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine, was based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a large government health survey conducted annually. Health.com: 11 things it's best to buy organic . Although the study is merely a ""red flag"" and more research is needed, minimizing exposure to PFOA still may be prudent in the meantime, says Dr. Debabrata Mukherjee, chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso. For instance, people whose drinking water may be contaminated by nearby factories that use PFOA could use bottled water or filtered water, says Mukherjee, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. Avoiding nonstick cookware and other consumer products that may contain PFOA is another way for individuals to limit exposure, he adds. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the trace amounts of PFOA found in consumer products are generally a remnant of the manufacturing process and do not appear to pose a threat to human health. Still, the agency is working with several large companies to eliminate PFOA and related chemicals from products and factory emissions by 2015. Prior studies in humans, animals and petri dishes have suggested several pathways through which PFOA might affect heart health. PFOA exposure has been associated, for instance, with blood-vessel dysfunction, high ""bad"" cholesterol (LDL), low ""good"" cholesterol (HDL), and insulin resistance, all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Health.com: 10 ways to lower cholesterol . Even if this preliminary research is borne out, however, it's important to remember that obesity, smoking, high blood pressure, and other classic risk factors are responsible for an overwhelming majority of heart attacks, says Dr. Eugene Storozynsky, a cardiologist and internist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In an underground bunker in the heart of New York City a unique experiment is taking place. Going underground: ""Quiet: We Live in Public"" volunteers lived in tiny boxes in an artificial society with their every move filmed 24-hours a day. More than 100 people have moved into an artificial society where their every move will be captured on film. Living like battery hens in tiny cubes stacked one on top of the other, these exhibitionists have signed up to live -- to eat, sleep, shower, party, go to the toilet and even have sex with each other -- under the unwavering gaze of hundreds of cameras recording 24 hours a day. Everything is free but participants must wear uniforms, submit to regular ""interrogations"" and, of course, give up any notion of privacy, not to mention freedom. The atmosphere lies somewhere between The Factory, Andy Warhol's hip 1960s studio famed for its parties, and a sci-fi version of the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment. It may sound like the latest extreme reality TV show but, in fact, this extraordinary experiment took place in late 1999, at the turn of the millennium. The first Big Brother TV show had been broadcast only a few months previously in The Netherlands and the Internet as we know it was still in its infancy. The project was called ""Quiet: We Live in Public"" and the man behind it, described as the ""Warhol of the web,"" was extreme visionary and dotcom entrepreneur, Josh Harris. Now, almost 10 years later, the cameras are back on, and this time Harris himself is under the spotlight. ""We Live in Public,"" which was awarded the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, is a documentary by director Ondi Timoner which chronicles the rise and fall of Harris, ""the greatest Internet pioneer you've never heard of."" She describes Harris' life as a cautionary tale. Is the Internet just another handy tool or is it fundamentally changing the way we behave? Tell us below in the SoundOff box. Harris was one of the crop of highly publicized wunderkind entrepreneurs splashed across magazine covers, making millions of dollars during the mid-1990s dotcom bubble. He was among the first people to recognize the potential of the Internet and in 1994, Harris used some of his estimated $80 million fortune to found Pseudo.com, the first Internet television network. It was an idea so ahead of its time that it would be another seven years before broadband -- which Internet television requires to work effectively -- was in general use in America. Harris' foresight didn't stop there. He was convinced he could anticipate the future effects of this new technology on human behavior. He believed that people would be willing to go to any lengths to share their lives -- that Warhol's 15 minutes of fame in a lifetime wouldn't be enough; that people would want their 15 minutes of fame every day. Harris set up the ""Quiet"" bunker to prove his point, saying that people would want a piece of the ""fame"" the project offered despite the extreme conditions, and asked Timoner to ""document the cultural history"" as it happened. On January 1, 2000, just thirty days after Harris launched his extraordinary project, it was shut down as a ""millennial cult"" by U.S. agency, FEMA. Soon after, Harris attempted to reprise the experiment, but this time it was more extreme and he and his girlfriend were the guinea pigs. He fitted 32 motion-controlled cameras and 60 microphones in his Broadway apartment to record live streaming video of every aspect of their private lives 24/7, which Web site users could watch and comment on in a forum. Harris wanted to see what would happen if he exposed his entire life to the public, and planned to live like this for three months. He even planned for his girlfriend to conceive in public. ""Our life became tied to the watchers,"" remembers Harris. ""They were actually another brain that was controlling us ... they were influencing, maybe not controlling, but they were certainly influencing us and sometimes we didn't know that they were doing it."" Living this way put an unbearable strain on his relationship and the couple broke up before the experiment could be completed. Meanwhile, Harris lost his fortune when the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. Soon after, he had a nervous breakdown and moved to upstate New York, withdrawing completely from from public life. The five thousand hours of footage Timoner shot during the ""Quiet"" bunker experiment were left untouched for nearly a decade. Timoner admits that it is only very recently that the events of 10 years ago started to make sense to her. She says it has taken her this long to understand Harris, ""as a visionary, what he predicts, and also what he embodies as a walking cautionary tale of taking technology too far."" But, according to Timoner -- who won the Grand Jury prize at Sundance once before for ""DiG!"", another cautionary tale about the rise and fall of front men from American rock bands Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols --Harris' story is a universal one - and heralds a future where privacy is a distant memory from the past. ""That is your story. It's my story. It's all of our story right now, and now is the tipping point where the virtual world is starting to take over.""

"(CNN) -- A former Peace Corps volunteer from Connecticut is charged with sexual abuse of several preschool children in South Africa last year. Jesse Osmun, 31, worked at an AIDS center in Greytown, South Africa, that provided education, food and other services to children between the ages of 3 and 15, a criminal complaint says. Osmun, while volunteering at the center's preschool facility, allegedly sexually molested at least five girls under the age of 6, according to the complaint. The complaint also alleges he engaged in illicit sexual conduct with one of the girls, approximately 5 years old, twice a week for five months. Osmun was confronted by the AIDS center program manager in May 2011 after a preschool teacher alleged that when she observed him in a toy room of the facility with three little girls, Osmun appeared startled and zipped up his pants. The complaint states that one of the children told a school official Osmun had given her candy in exchange for oral sex. Osmun initially denied any illicit activity but ""subsequently admitted that he had touched one of the children under her clothes,"" the complaint says. It says Osmun asked to resign from the Peace Corps and returned to the United States on June 2. An investigation was launched into the sexual allegations, and Osmun was arrested Thursday at his home in Milford, Connecticut, where, the complaint states, ""Osmun began to admit that he molested children (at the preschool) and provide details about the molestation."" He appeared before a federal judge in Bridgeport and was detained. Osmun's attorney, federal public defender Sarah Merriam, declined to comment. Osmun would face a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 if convicted of the charge of traveling outside of the United States to engage in sexual conduct with a minor. ""Mr. Osmun is charged with a shocking breach of the power entrusted to him as a Peace Corps volunteer,"" said Assistant U.S.  Attorney General Lanny Breuer. ""Allegedly, he repeatedly sexually abused five minor girls under the age of 6 -- horrific crimes."" The Peace Corps issued a statement saying it ""was made aware of the allegations against the former volunteer after Osmun resigned from Peace Corps and departed South Africa. Once notified, the agency immediately contacted the appropriate authorities. ""The Peace Corps will continue to cooperate with American and South African law enforcement authorities,"" it said, adding that all Peace Corps volunteers undergo background checks.","Jesse Osmun, 31, worked at a preschool facility in Greytown, South Africa .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least six security personnel were killed and eight members of Sri Lanka's cricket team hurt -- including two with gunshot wounds -- in an attack Tuesday on the team's bus by gunmen in Lahore, Pakistan. A video grab shows a suspected gunman near Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan, Tuesday. The Sri Lankan players were traveling to the city's Gaddafi Stadium for the third day of the second test match against Pakistan at around 9 a.m. local time (11 p.m. ET) when the attack occurred. Video footage showed several gunmen with automatic weapons opening firing on the convoy from a roundabout, Liberty Square, close to the stadium. Police said at least 12 gunmen were involved. Pakistani Information Minister Sherry Rahman told CNN the attackers were still at large. Witnesses described the scene as ""pandemonium."" Images showed police vehicles with their windscreens punctured by bullets and their front seats stained with blood. A body lies in the road in front of one bullet-shattered van. ""I heard two loud explosions outside the stadium and a lot of AK-47 fire,"" said Hamish Roberts, a cameraman who was inside the stadium at the time. See a map of where the attack took place » .

Cricket manager Charlie Austin, who represents six of the Sri Lankan squad, said none of the players' injuries were life-threatening. ""The guys are shocked. They are recovering at the moment,"" Austin told CNN. ""Thankfully they've only suffered minor injuries. They're keen to leave Pakistan and get back to their families as soon as possible."" Watch Austin describe the mood of the Sri Lankan players after the attack » . Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said the squad would be flown home to Colombo later Tuesday. Bogollagama is traveling to Pakistan for talks with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Sri Lankan officials have ruled out Tamil separatists, who have been waging a bloody civil war on the Southeast Asian island. Witnesses who saw the attack praised the response of security officials. ""The guards were brilliant. They weren't panicking. They were very calm,"" sports producer Gavin Scovell said. ""It must have been a terrifying experience, but they handled it well."" ""Our policemen rose to the occasion and laid down their lives to protect our Sri Lankan guests,"" said Pakistan's President Zardari. Pakistan, which is battling Islamist and Taliban insurgents in its North West Frontier Province, has struggled to attract visiting cricket teams in recent years because of security concerns. Watch how attack strikes at legitimacy of Pakistani government » . The current test series with Sri Lanka is the Pakistani team's first since touring India in 2007. In 2002 a car bomb exploded outside a hotel where the New Zealand cricket team was staying. Last year Australia canceled a proposed tour in the wake of a series of suicide bombings. The International Cricket Council was also forced to postpone the high-profile ICC Champions Trophy after five of the eight participants pulled out. Pakistan is due to co-host the Cricket World Cup in 2011 with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, although the extent of its involvement in that tournament now appears to be under scrutiny. John Stern, the editor of cricket magazine Wisden, said it was ""not possible"" to imagine international cricket taking place in Pakistan in the near future and described the outlook for the sport in the country as ""desperate."" ""Pakistan has been struggling for a while. They hadn't played a test match in the entirety of 2008,"" Stern told CNN.

""We note with dismay and regret the events of this morning in Lahore and we condemn this attack without reservation,"" Lorgat said. ""I have confirmed with both member boards that the remainder of the tour has been canceled and we are working hard to get our match officials out of the area as safely and as quickly as possible."" Sri Lanka agreed in December to visit Pakistan after India called off a tour following November's terror attacks in Mumbai. Indian authorities blamed the attacks on Pakistan-based militants. Pakistan's Cricket Board had hoped Sri Lanka's tour would help it recoup some of more than $16 million it was set to lose as a result of India's cancelation. The Sri Lankan offer to tour was a reciprocal gesture. Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to play in Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament after other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns over the country's civil war with Tamil separatists.","6 security staff dead, several Sri Lankan cricketers hurt in attack in Lahore .

"Washington (CNN) -- Seven states on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the federal government requirement that religious employers offer health insurance coverage that includes contraceptives and other birth control services. The issue has become a political flashpoint in a presidential election year, and the lawsuit by attorneys general from Nebraska, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Florida and Texas was certain to keep it prominent. Private plaintiffs joining the seven states included Pius X Catholic High School, Catholic Social Services, Catholic Mutual Relief Society of America and private citizens Stacy Molai and Sister Mary Catherine. The 25-page lawsuit named the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius; the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner; and the U.S. Department of Labor and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis as defendants. It alleges a violation of the First Amendment and of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, saying that the requirement for employees at church-affiliated institutions such as hospitals to receive health coverage for contraceptives and other birth control services contravened constitutionally protected religious freedom. ""Government has no business forcing religious institutions and individuals to violate their sincerely held beliefs,"" Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement Thursday. ""This lawsuit is about protecting religious liberty and the rights of conscience, our most basic freedoms as Americans."" Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said the government rule under the health care reform law passed in 2010 ""compels people of faith to act contrary to their convictions."" ""The very first amendment to our Constitution was intended to protect against this sort of government intrusion into our religious convictions,"" Abbott said. Abbott and Bondi are Republicans. Officials from the White House and the Department of Justice had no comment on the pending litigation. However, it is not the first court challenge to the Obama administration's new mandate on contraceptive coverage. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty has filed a series of lawsuits, arguing that even the revised polices on contraception access would constitute a violation of their clients' faith. Last week, the Justice Department urged judges to stay out of the controversy until a compromise can be worked out. At issue is whether religious institutions should be exempt from mandated employee coverage for birth control and other reproductive care. The administration announced a proposed compromise in the dispute earlier this month. Under its new plan, religiously affiliated universities and hospitals would not be forced to offer contraception coverage to their employees. Insurers will be required, however, to offer complete coverage for free to women who work at such institutions. In announcing the proposed compromise, Obama said ""no woman's health should depend on who she is or where she works or how much money she makes."" He added that ""the principle of religious liberty"" was also at stake, and ""as a citizen and as a Christian, I cherish this right."" Female employees at churches themselves will have no guarantee of any contraception coverage -- a continuation of current law. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops denounced Obama's compromise soon after the president's announcement, saying the proposal raises ""serious moral concerns,"" according to a statement posted on its website. Half of all Americans polled say they oppose the Obama administration's new policy, according to a CNN/ORC International survey. The final version of the contraception requirement goes into effect next January. The administration said that under a safe harbor provision, no group can be forced to provide birth control at least until year's end. CNN's Bill Mears, Susan Candiotti and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: Religious freedom is the underlying issue, Texas attorney general says .

"(CNN) -- At least five people were killed when a man opened fire at a Minneapolis business and then turned the gun on himself, police said Friday. The incident occurred about 4:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET) Thursday at Accent Signage Systems in the Bryn Mawr neighborhood, said Sgt. Steven McCarty of the Minneapolis Police Department. ""I can confirm that the shooter is dead,"" Deputy Chief Kris Arneson told reporters. ""And he died by a gunshot wound -- self-inflicted."" Police did not immediately give a motive for the shooting. Raymond Thomas ""R.T."" Rybak Jr. said that he visited the business about a month ago and that it was rapidly expanding around the world ""because they have such cutting-edge technologies."" Accent Signage Systems specializes in interior signs that help the visually impaired, CNN affiliate KARE reported. The company holds a patent for technology that imprints Braille on things like hotel room numbers and restroom signs. According to the company's Facebook page, Accent started as a part-time engraving business out of company president Reuven Rahamim's basement in 1984, KARE reported. Accent now employs about 30 people and earns $5 million to $10 million each year, the station reported. A neighbor who lives close to the business told KARE that an Accent employee hid in her house to escape the shooting. ""He was visibly fearful,"" Barb Gasterland said. ""He came running up the side of the road and asked for the phone because he was running from the shooter."" Gasterland told KARE that the employee saw his boss and best friend get shot, along with two others. In a statement, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he deplored the ""senseless"" shooting.

"(CNN) -- NATO forces patrolling the Gulf of Aden foiled a pirate attack on a Norwegian tanker this weekend, a NATO spokesman said. The Canadian navy's HMCS Winnipeg helped foil a pirate attack on a Norwegian tanker Sunday, NATO says. Pirates attempted to capture the MV Front Ardennes at 6 p.m. Saturday and were apprehended seven hours later, Commander Chris Davies told CNN. A NATO-supported Canadian navy ship, the HMCS Winnipeg, was returning from escorting a World Food Program vessel in the gulf when it saw the Norwegian ship under attack, Davies said. A British Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel, the Wave Knight, was also in the area. The pirates were captured at 1 a.m. Sunday after they threw weapons, ladders and scaling equipment overboard, Davies said. Several rounds of ammunition were found on the pirates' boat. The pirates were detained, but allowed to go free after questioning. There is currently no formal procedure for NATO personnel to follow once they have apprehended pirates, Davies noted. Their weapons are confiscated and they are then typically given provisions and released. The Sunday incident is the latest in a string of hijackings off the Horn of Africa, which have received more attention since pirates attacked a U.S.-flagged cargo ship on April 8 and took its captain hostage.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich continued their fast start to the Bundesliga season with a 6-1 rout of ten-man VfB Stuttgart Sunday to top the early standings. With two wins from two, the Bavarian giants have edged out Eintracht Frankfurt on goal difference and they served up a real treat for their fans in the Allianz Arena. Stuttgart went ahead with a superb strike from Martin Harnik, but Thomas Mueller equalized with the first of his two goals. His German international teammate Toni Kroos added a second with Luis Gustavo scoring the third before the break. Three Bayern goals in four minutes soon after the break added to Stuttgart's misery with Mario Mandzukic, Mueller and Bastian Schweinsteiger scoring. Visiting striker Vedad Ibisevic was shown red for headbutting Bayern's Jerome Boateng before new home signing Javi Martinez came on for the last 13 minutes having transferred from Athletic Bilbao for 40 million euros ($50.3m) Thursday. ""He has already hinted that he can play well, I think he is exactly the sort of player we need,"" Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes told AFP. ""We made life hard for ourselves in the first few minutes, then little by little we took control of the game and played outstandingly well."" Earlier, Felix Magath's Wolfsburg were thrashed 4-0 at home by Hannover and had defender Robin Knoche sent off in the second half. Tunisia defender Karim Haggui put Hannover ahead after only 10 minutes before Poland's Artur Sobiech added the second on 26 minutes. Dane Leon Andreasen and Sobiech with his second made it 4-0 before Knoche departed for a second yellow card. In Italy, Turin giants Juventus have also made a fine start to the season with their second straight win -- beating Udinese 4-1. The reigning champions are having to do without coach Antonio Conte, who has a 10-month touchline ban for failing to give information about match fixing when at his previous club Siena. Conte is appealing the ban and spent the game at Udinese's Stadio Friuli high in the stands. He watched as Udinese goalkeeper Zelijko Brkic was sent off for giving away a 12th minute penalty. Arturo Vidal scored from the spot kick and Marko Vucinic added the second on 39 minutes. Striker Sebastien Giovinco scored a second half double before a late consolation from the home side from Andrea Lazzari. AS Roma also prospered with a 3-1 win at Inter Milan, going ahead in the 15th minute through Alessandro Florenzi. New Inter arrival Antonio Cassano leveled before goals from Daniel Osvaldo and Marquinho gave the visitors the three points, Osvaldo's dismissal in stoppage time the only blot on a fine performance.","Bayern Munich beat VfB Stuttgart 6-1 to top Bundesliga .

"(CNN) -- Shocks were at a premium as 2014 World Cup qualifying kicked off in Europe Friday but Portugal were given a fright before beating minnows Luxembourg 2-1 in their opener in Group F. It needed a Cristiano Ronaldo equalizer in the first half to cancel out Daniel Da Mota's 14th minute opener for the hosts. Helder Postiga hit the winner just before the hour mark as they kept pace with Russia, who earlier beat Northern Ireland 2-0 in Moscow. Of the big guns, England were the most comprehensive winners, beating Moldova 5-0 in Chisinau with Frank Lampard scoring a first half double and Jermain Defoe adding the other. James Milner and Leighton Baines were on target after the break as Roy Hodgson's team took an early advantage in Group H with Montenegro and Poland sharing four goals in the other match in the qualifying section. Germany were made to work hard by the Faroe Islands whose goalkeeper Gunnar Nielsen made a series of fine saves. The home side only led 1-0 at halftime in Hannover, but a second half double from Real Madrid star Mesut Ozil gave them a more comfortable 3-0 advantage by the final whistle. Republic of Ireland were the other winners on the night in Group C as two late goals from Robbie Keane, with a penalty, and Kevin Doyle gave them a fortunate 2-1 win in Kazakhstan. Euro 2012 runners-up Italy were grateful for a 2-2 draw in Bulgaria in Group, falling behind to a long range strike from Stanislav Manolev. Italy hit back in the Vasil Levski Stadium in Sofia with a pair of goals from their Argentine-born striker Pablo Osvaldo. But Gerogi Milanov finished off a fine move to give the home side a deserved point. France made a winning start in the tough looking Group I which also features reigning World and European champions Spain, who sat out the opening round of fixtures.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A judge has postponed the trial of a Philadelphia Catholic priest and a parochial school teacher, both accused of raping the same altar boy in separate incidents. The trial, scheduled to start Tuesday, was postponed due to a family emergency for a defense attorney. A new trial date could be set by the end of the week. The Rev. Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at St. Jerome Parish in northeast Philadelphia, and Bernard Shero, a teacher at the parish's school, have been charged with rape, indecent sexual assault and other criminal charges in the alleged assaults that occurred more than a decade ago. The accuser, dubbed ""Billy"" in a 2011 Philadelphia grand jury report, will be the key witness against the men, both of whom have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The former altar boy, now in his 20s, testified earlier this year during the landmark trial of two Philadelphia priests charged with child sexual abuse and conspiracy. It marked the first time a Catholic church leader -- in this case, Monsignor William Lynn -- has been convicted for covering up the crimes of offending priests. Billy reported to authorities in 2009 that he was sexually abused while he was in Catholic grade school by Engelhardt, Shero and another priest, Edward Avery. A grand jury determined his allegations had merit, and the priests were subsequently charged and arrested. They were among dozens of Philadelphia priests accused of sex abuse in the grand jury report. According to the grand jury's report, Engelhardt allegedly showed Billy pornographic magazines before having him engage in oral intercourse in the sacristy, the room inside the church where a priest prepares for Mass. The alleged incident happened in 1998 when Billy was 10. The following school year, Shero, the boy's sixth-grade teacher at St. Jerome School, is accused of sodomizing the then 11-year-old, according to the grand jury report. Shero allegedly offered the boy a ride home and then stopped at a park. He told the boy they were ""going to have fun,"" took off his clothes, allegedly raped the boy, then made him walk the rest of the way home, the grand jury report stated. In April, Billy testified at the trial of Lynn, the first high-ranking church figure charged with child endangerment for shuffling predator priests from parish to parish, and the Rev. James Brennan, who was accused of the attempted rape of a 14-year-old altar boy. Lynn, 61, was found guilty in June of one count of child endangerment and later sentenced to three to six years in prison. The jury was unable to bring a verdict against Brennan, who is scheduled to be retried next year before a new judge. Avery, who had been scheduled to be on trial with Lynn and Brennan, pleaded guilty after admitting he sexually assaulted Billy when he was 10, and was sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years. In his April testimony, Billy detailed the alleged abuse at the hands of Avery when he was in the fifth grade. He also testified that the sexual assault led to a life of substance abuse, a suicide attempt and a criminal history including drug possession. He said he did not tell anyone about the abuse until 2009, after a group therapy session for his drug use. When asked why he didn't speak out earlier, Billy said he was ""too scared."" ""I thought that I would get into trouble and that no one would believe me,"" he told jurors in April. ""I thought I did something wrong, and, he's a priest."" Priests, particularly those in high-ranking positions, have an exceptional amount of power within the Catholic Church, especially in Philadelphia because of the church's deep roots in the community. With nearly 1.5 million members, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia is one of the largest in the nation. A new archbishop has been installed to help turn around the scandal-plagued archdiocese.

"(CNN) -- Keith Campbell, the scientist who helped pioneer the birth of Dolly the sheep, the world's first mammal cloned from fully developed adult cells, has died, according to The University of Nottingham. Campbell, 58, died on October 5, according to a university statement released Thursday. His funeral has been scheduled for October 24. The university did not say how he died. Campbell was part of a team at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland, that cloned Dolly in 1996. Her birth made headlines worldwide, capturing the scientific imagination of many while generating intense controversy over the ethics of cloning. While Campbell is not listed in research papers as the principal investigator in papers related to Dolly's cloning, the man who is -- Ian Wilmut -- told The Telegraph newspaper in 2009 that Campbell deserved much of the credit for the feat. He was more recently focused on the use of stem cells and gene transplantation as tools for studying and treating human disease, according to his research profile. Jose Cibelli, a Michigan State University researcher, said Campbell's work has led directly to treatments that will soon be saving lives around the world. ""We anticipate that within the next five years, patients suffering from degenerative diseases will be treated -- if not cured -- using technology introduced by Dr. Campbell,"" the university quoted him as saying. ""All these scientific breakthroughs Professor Campbell gave us did not happen by chance; they are the product of years of study, hands-on experimentation and above all, a deep love for science.""

"(CNN) -- World Wrestling Entertainment announcer Jerry ""The King"" Lawler was in stable condition after suffering a heart attack, WWE said. As of Tuesday morning, Lawler was in a cardiac care unit and his vital signs were stable, WWE said in a written statement. Lawler, a larger-than-life figure even within the flamboyant world of professional wrestling, suffered a heart attack and collapsed during a show Monday night, the show's producers announced. Lawler, 62, was given CPR in the locker room of the arena in Montreal before being taken to a hospital, co-host Michael Cole told viewers during a break in the televised program. Lawler was in the emergency room and breathing on his own, but ""this is an extremely serious situation. This is not part of tonight's entertainment,"" he said. ""This is a real-life situation."" Cole said the star was responding to tests and would be given a CT scan at the hospital, adding, ""Jerry, my friend, my prayers are with you."" ""I'm shaken by the news of my friend Jerry Lawler's medical emergency in Montreal. Hands shaking. Prayers for the King. I feel helpless,"" WWE announcer Jim Ross said on Twitter. Lawler made his name in wrestling in the 1970s, but he became famous beyond the wrestling world for a 1982 bout with comedian Andy Kaufman. The Great Ruse: Andy Kaufman, the comedic genius who rocked wrestling . Kaufman, who had begun wrestling women during his nightclub act, accepted a challenge from Lawler, who accused him of demeaning the sport. Kaufman trash-talked both the wrestler and the crowd in Memphis, Tennessee, before the match, and the 6-foot, 243-pound Lawler trounced the skinny comedian, who was hauled away in a stretcher. A few weeks later, the pair appeared on ""Late Night with David Letterman"" and got into an argument that ended with Lawler slapping Kaufman, followed by Kaufman delivering a profanity-laced tirade and being chased off the set. The wrestler gave as good as he got in trash-talking the comedian, letting loose with: ""Andy Kaufman's mom wanted a girl, his father wanted a boy, and they were both satisfied!"" Lawler lists the slapping of Kaufman on the Letterman show as the highlight of his career. But like much of Kaufman's shtick, the feud was an elaborate put-on. ""They'd be at the coliseum, supposedly trying to kill each other, and then I'd get off the 10 o'clock newscast and walk into the newsroom, and Jerry and Andy would be sitting in an edit booth discussing what had happened and where to go from there,"" veteran Memphis wrestling announcer Dave Brown told CNN earlier this year. Lawler was inducted into the Connecticut-based WWE's Hall of Fame in 2007 and played himself in the 1999 Kaufman biopic ""Man on the Moon."" A native of Memphis, with bright blue eyes and a baby face into his 60s, Lawler describes himself as loved in his hometown but hated in his wrestling federation, ""where his arrogant, egotistical attitude got him into feuds with former WWF champ Bret Hart and federation head Vince McMahon."" The WWF is the former name of the WWE. He started wrestling in 1970 in Memphis, where he won multiple regional championships and the Mid-South Wrestling circuit. He career had gone national by the mid-1970s, and he continued to wrestle for decades. In recent years, he has been known better as a commentator. ""We are hopeful Jerry makes a full recovery and returns to WWE in the near future. Our thoughts are with Jerry and his family,"" the WWE said on its website.

"(CNN) -- The University of California is offering to pay $30,000 to each of 21 protesters who were pepper-sprayed by a campus policeman last year, according to a proposed out-of-court lawsuit settlement. If approved by a federal court, the deal could end the suit by demonstrators at an Occupy Movement encampment who were protesting tuition hikes and university privatization. Plaintiffs said police violated their civil rights and a school report called the spraying ""objectively unreasonable."" The campus police officer who pepper-sprayed the protesters was no longer working at the school as of late July. The school declined to say whether the officer, Lt. John Pike, quit or was let go. Video footage of Pike spraying student demonstrators with the irritant at close range went viral, provoking widespread criticism of school authorities and making him a target of Internet ridicule. Under the pending agreement, which was announced Wednesday, the University of California would also pay $250,000 to plaintiffs' attorneys. It also would set aside a $100,000 fund to pay as much as $20,000 to each individual who joins the class-action suit and can prove he was pepper-sprayed or arrested during the protest. The money would come from the school system's general liability risk program, a self-insured fund, the president's office said. Opinion: Occupy fizzled, but made 99% a force . During the November 2011 protest, about a dozen demonstrators were seated on a path with their arms interlocked as police moved in to clear out members of the Occupy movement who were camped in the area. Officers forcibly removed the demonstrators after they had been sprayed. UC Davis had declared the protest unlawful. In addition to tuition increases and privatization, the demonstrators were protesting treatment of demonstrators at another campus -- the University of California at Berkeley, according to the proposed settlement. The plaintiffs alleged their civil rights were violated by being subjected to unlawful arrest and excessive force, the settlement papers said. Opinion: My arrest at Occupy Wall Street . U.C. Davis placed Pike, a second officer and Campus Police Chief Annette Spicuzza on administrative leave after the incident. In addition to calling the spraying an ""objectionably unreasonable"" use of force, a UC report on the incident accused Pike of misusing his weapon. The bright red pepper-spray canister the officer brandished before spraying was a higher pressure type and ""not an authorized weapon"" under campus police guidelines, the report said. The canister was designed to be used at a distance of at least 6 feet and ""Lt. Pike did not use it correctly,"" the report found. The report also blamed members of the U.C. Davis leadership, citing ""systemic and repeated failures"" among campus administrators that ""put officers in the unfortunate situation in which they found themselves.""

"(CNN) -- Robin van Persie atoned for an embarrassing second half penalty miss to complete a hat-trick and give Manchester United a dramatic 3-2 win at Southampton Sunday in the English Premier League. United had to come from behind twice to claim the three points at St Mary's but it was tough on the newly promoted home side, who played a full part in a pulsating early season encounter. They went ahead after 16 minutes when Rickie Lambert headed home at the far post after a fine cross by Jason Puncheon. The lead did not last long as van Persie, signed from Arsenal in close season, chested home a cross and fired across Kelvin Davis in the Southampton goal. The visitors looked uneasy in defense throughout -- despite Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic being re-united in the center -- and in the second half a slip by Patrice Evra allowed Morgan Schneiderlin to head Southampton ahead again. Alex Ferguson's men looked set to level for the second time after Jos Hooiveld had fouled van Persie to earn a penalty. The Dutchman got up to take the spot kick but appeared to change his mind halfway through his effort and could only chip a weak effort which Davis tipped away. ""I don't know what I was thinking of with the penalty,"" van Persie told Sky Sports at the end of the match. ""I was going to blast it but at the last second I just changed, that wasn't good enough."" But it did not take long for him to make amends, reacting quickly after a Ferdinand header came off the home woodwork. Then in injury time he met Nani's near post cross with a perfect header to win the match and score his 100th EPL goal. Ferguson was delighted with the three points and gave particular credit to second half substitute Paul Scholes, who turned the match their way. ""He changed the game completely, his vision and consistency of passing gave us complete control,"" said the United boss, who was winning his 599th out of 1,000 league games. In the earlier kick off, Arsenal showed they could do without van Persie's goals with a 2-0 win at Liverpool, who have made their worst start to a top flight season since 1963-63 with one point from three games. Arsene Wenger's men had failed to score in their first two EPL games, but two of his summer signings came good at Anfield. Germany striker Lukas Podolski scored his first goal for the club in the first half while Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla grabbed the second for the Gunners in the second half. Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina was at fault for the goal to complete a lackluster display by new manager Brendan Rogers' team. The other game Sunday saw Newcastle held 1-1 at home by Aston Villa, needing a superb equalizer from French star Hatem Ben Arfa on the hour mark to salvage a point. Ciaran Clark's first-half opener had given Villa the lead and Tim Krul had to produce good saves to deny Darren Bent and Andreas Weimann as the visitors pressed for a second.","Manchester United win 3-2 at promoted Southampton in EPL .

"(CNN) -- These are the days of uncertainty. The pollsters tell us so. You wouldn't know it from the pundits, however. They rend their garments or sing hosannas as if each little survey statistic was handed down from on high, chiseled into tablets. ""Is Mitt Romney panicking?"" asked a Washington Post headline in mid-September after polls indicated President Obama had received a post-convention bounce. ""Did Obama just throw the entire election away?"" an alarmed Andrew Sullivan asked after the first presidential debate, reeling off a flurry of the president's poor polling numbers. The fact is, every day is a day of uncertainty -- and we hate that. Psychologically, it gives us comfort to determine our fates, says Dr. David Reiss, a San Diego-based psychiatrist and expert on personality dynamics. ""We're sort of hardwired to predict what is going to happen to protect ourselves,"" he says. After all, for much of mankind's recorded history, a prediction could literally mean the difference between life and death -- whether it was determining a village's vulnerability to attack or attempting to figure out the size of the coming harvest. But, he adds, there's also a sense of power and ego in knowing the future: ""If I can predict things, I have some control and it releases feelings of helplessness or fear,"" he says. ""The more I can predict, the smarter I am and the better I look to others."" Throw in the chattering, nattering, opinion-splattering classes -- which traffic in confidence and authority -- and you create a stew of statements that seldom veers from bet-the-house conviction. In his new book, ""The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail -- But Some Don't,"" statistician and FiveThirtyEight.com creator Nate Silver looked into almost 1,000 predictions of the D.C.-based ""McLaughlin Group"" pundits. They were about half right -- no better than a coin flip. These Beltway insiders ""displayed about as much political acumen as a barbershop quartet,"" Silver writes. Compare that with weather forecasters, Silver says in an interview. The profession, which has improved consistently over the years, makes a virtue out of unknowns, such as the ""cone of probability"" in hurricane tracking. ""They're being honest about how much they know and how much they don't know,"" he says. ""So they've made progress, whereas people who are trying to make the perfect prediction and take political science and treat it as though it's physics are failing much more often,"" he says. An appreciation of uncertainty ""requires a dose of humility that the weather forecasters have that the (pundits) don't."" Numbers overload: Polling data hype sways voters . 'You find the uncertainty and kind of wallow in it' We may want to laugh about the ""McLaughlin"" folks -- they're providing entertainment, not prophecy -- but the overall point of Silver's book is that poor predictions can cost society dearly. Look at the financial crisis, which blindsided most economists, or the early visions of the Iraq war, which turned out to be anything but the predicted ""cakewalk."" It's no wonder that, throughout history, kings and emperors put so much stock in soothsayers, or that tales of Joseph, Daniel, Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi are still touchstones. We also revel when the experts are wrong. An Irish mathematician said speedy trains were impractical because they'd cause breathing deprivation. A 1901 critic said only one of Mark Twain's works would endure: ""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County."" And then there's the founder of the onetime technology behemoth Digital Equipment Corp., who said in 1977, ""There's no reason a person would want a computer in their home."" Digital was bought by home computer-maker Compaq in 1998. (TheWeek.com has a whole page devoted to such opinions.) Pollsters shouldn't get cocky, either. In 1936, the prestigious Literary Digest -- which ran what was then considered the gold standard of presidential polls -- proclaimed that Republican Alf Landon would beat President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Instead, Roosevelt won the greatest electoral landslide of modern times. The Digest, suddenly a laughingstock, folded two years later. The Digest's failure led to the rise of pollster George Gallup, who brought statistical rigor to polling. But even Gallup could falter: His poll missed the Harry Truman-Thomas Dewey contest of 1948. Futurists are professional predictors, some of them paid tidy sums for their expertise in forecasting the direction society, technology and nations are moving. Cindy Frewen Wuellner, an architect and chairwoman of the Association of Professional Futurists, says the key to good forecasting is knowing what you don't know and doing your research. ""As a futurist, you find the uncertainty and kind of wallow in it,"" she says. ""You make sure the uncertainty is explored layer by layer."" She observes that context is key. We're always making fun of the fact that we don't have a ""Jetsons""-like present of flying cars, she points out, but seldom think about what's required to build that kind of society. ""It's not the innovation, it's the diffusion of it,"" she says, pointing out that we'd need to create a whole infrastructure for such vehicles (which do exist). ""It's enough to have the FAA dealing with all the planes in the air. What if every single car was a plane?"" People (like, perhaps, sports talking heads or Washington pundits) often believe predictions are ""a single scenario,"" she adds. ""Futurists believe in futures with an 'S,' meaning multiple scenarios. And the only scenario that isn't going to happen is business as usual. You can't just take today and multiply it out and call it tomorrow."" Which is one of the issues in interpreting polls. Too often, observers look at what is so often characterized as a ""snapshot"" of data and jump to conclusions. It doesn't help, says Emory University political scientist and polling expert Alan Abramowitz, that there are more polls than ever. ""If you go back to the 1950s and '60s, there were only a few polling organizations,"" he says. ""It's really in the last two or three presidential election cycles that we've seen a proliferation of polls."" Moreover, as technology has changed, so have polling methods. Polling used to be done face to face. Now it's all done by telephone -- a much cheaper alternative, Abramowitz says, but not necessarily more accurate, what with robocalls, lack of callbacks and sampling challenges based on land line and cell phone users. Then there's ""rational ignorance"" -- the consciously shallow understanding and apathy of many possible respondents. There have been movements to counter these flaws, such as Stanford University's ""Deliberative Polling,"" but the general process remains imperfect. Some organizations have adjusted well, others have not -- but all the data are thrown into the mix, a haystack of straws for pundits to grasp. 'Town meeting' or fodder for denialists? In his book ""When the People Speak,"" James Fishkin, a Stanford political scientist, observed that George Gallup believed polling solved a host of civic ills. Along with mass media, polling ""created a town meeting on a national scale,"" Gallup wrote in 1938. So much for that. Instead, many people have used the snapshot statistics as a club with which to pound their opponents -- or they deny their usefulness entirely. Indeed, these days, some people hold onto their views so strongly that they resist actual facts. Both parties have fallen into the trap: In 2004, some Democrats, lulled by early exit polls that indicated a narrow victory for John Kerry, claimed that the election had been stolen. More recently, some Republicans have claimed that the polls themselves are skewed. In an essay for Slate, law professor Richard L. Hasen, author of ""The Voting Wars,"" asked if Republicans would accept an Obama victory. He pointed to a rise in distrust of election results -- from members of both parties -- since the 2000 Bush v. Gore contest. ""The lesson from these statistics is simple. If my guy won, the election was fair and square. If your guy won, there must have been some kind of chicanery,"" he writes. Sigh. Sometimes, says futurist Frewen Wuellner, you just have to accept that you don't know the future until it occurs. In the meantime, research, prepare -- and expect uncertainty. ""Anybody who says they know for sure -- they're lying,"" she says. ""They don't know. Nobody knows for sure. There's always something that can happen. ""It's what makes the prediction business so big.""","Some people jump to conclusions based on polls, putting uncertainty aside .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The number of documented U.S. cases of fungal meningitis has risen yet again, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting 198 infections Saturday, including 15 deaths. The latest tally is 13 more than the agency reported Friday. And Saturday's death toll is an increase of one more than the previous day, due to a fatality in Indiana. Meningitis had been reported in 13 states thus far, with Tennessee the hardest hit with 52 documented infections and six deaths. One of the 198 cases reported Saturday is a ""peripheral joint infection"" that specifically affects a joint such as a knee, hip, shoulder or elbow. The cases have been linked to injections of a contaminated steroid produced by the New England Compounding Center. Some 14,000 people may have received the injections, the CDC estimated this week. Meningitis outbreak: What are compounding pharmacies? A Minnesota woman, Barbe Puro, filed a lawsuit Thursday -- which may be the first of its kind -- against the Massachusetts pharmaceutical company at the center of the deadly outbreak. In it, she alleges she was injected in September with a tainted batch of steroids from the NECC. Meanwhile, members of Congress on Friday expanded an investigation into the outbreak. In a letter to the director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy, leaders of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce noted the Food and Drug Administration sent the NECC a warning letter in 2006 ""detailing significant violations witnessed"" by investigators the previous year. Woman sues over outbreak . Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick also accused the NECC this week of misleading regulators and operating outside its license by shipping large batches of drugs nationwide. Plus, the state's pharmacy board mandated that all Massachusetts compounding pharmacies sign affidavits stating they are complying with state regulations requiring compounders to mix medications for specific patients. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens, such as fungi in this case, according to the CDC. Steroid injections common for back pain sufferers . Fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, is not contagious. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told CNN that fungal infections are not usually mild. He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says. CDC: Tests may not detect meningitis fungus .","The CDC reports 13 fungal meningitis cases more than Friday .

"(CNN) -- Devender had a crush on Lalita. She was so pretty. He'd take long looks at her during class. When she left school, Dev would ditch just to watch her walk down the hall, push the doors open and glide away. He thought about telling her all the time. But he was too scared. He liked her so much. High school is intense everywhere in this world. India is no different. One day, Dev saw his chance. He approached Lalita's brother. Please give this to your sister, he said, and handed the boy his number. And he waited. Nothing. ""I was tortured,"" he said. ""The girl I liked most wasn't calling me. I didn't have her number. I wanted to tell her, 'Lalita, I love you.' "" Days went by, and his mobile rang. Hearing her voice stunned him silent for a minute. ""Devender, are you OK?"" she asked. And they talked, as kids do, sweet and nervous. Pretty soon, they were in love. Eventually, Dev got the courage to tell Lalita that he just couldn't be without her. Will you marry me? he asked. She said yes. But she knew it would never be that simple. Lalita and Dev are from different castes, he from a lower one than she. Lalita knew that her parents would be furious and that they were working on finding someone for her to marry. But she told them anyway, still holding onto hope that they might understand. They didn't. 'Honor' crime: Why just kissing a boy can trigger murder . ""You will spoil your name!"" her parents shouted. Her father threatened to kill them both, and he hit Lalita. ""I was disturbed ... listening to (these) words,"" she said. ""The day my father came to know, that night he hit me and tortured me."" The 22-year-olds sat side by side today and recalled what they believed was their only option. ""We decided we will die, because we don't have any other way,"" Lalita said. Then, one afternoon, they caught a popular television talk show featuring an unlikely band of former lawyers and activists who've made it their mission to help doomed lovers. India's Love Commandos, formed in 2010, give couples food, shelter and protection if they run away from their disapproving families. The group has more than 11,000 volunteers across the country who provide legal assistance, man 24-hour help lines and, in some cases, even marry desperate couples. ""We have far too many problems in India to worry about someone choosing to love another,"" said founder Sanjoy Sachdev, who married his wife because he chose to. ""How can society object to love relationships?"" he asked. ""Our young boys and girls have rights. India has become the country of killers of love. ""Every couple that approaches us is under so much pressure, so much stigma, where they feel they may be killed any minute."" So-called honor killings have surged in India over the past few years, with victims defying traditional Hindu customs. Many of the deaths have been those choosing to marry outside their caste. At least five couples were killed in 2010. But that figure doesn't begin to show what human rights experts say are likely hundreds of reprisals. There are no official figures on honor killings, because they often go unreported or family members pass them off as suicides or natural deaths, according to Human Rights Watch. India's supreme court has issued notices to the national government and several states to protect couples, yet in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh provinces alone, an estimated 900 honor killings occur annually, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. State Department, citing reports from nongovernmental organizations. The Love Commandos stand a chance of accomplishing what officials have failed to do, said Meenakshi Ganguly, the Southeast Asia director of Human Rights Watch. ""There isn't a social worker network available to these young people who feel really isolated, so this group could be doing a wonderful thing,"" she said. The spike in honor killings is partly a result of India's changing cultural norms and a generation fighting to keep things the same. ""There's more television, more kids are going to college and blurring the social lines, so that people have a chance now to find a partner for themselves,"" Ganguly said. Dev and Lalita started their relationship and fostered it through calls on mobile phones. They imagine they'd never have even met if it weren't for them both attending the same school, because they lived in villages that were miles apart. She and Dev called Love Commandos, who are sheltering them in an undisclosed location. When CNN visited Lalita's family to try to get their side of the story, her grandfather shouted that there was no point. Lalita is ""as good as dead"" to them, he said. She knows she can't go home. Dev says that her family has filed complaints against his with local authorities and that his family and a friend who helped them have been jailed. But the two married, with Love Commandos' help. The group helped them craft a letter to their families, letting them know. They are thinking about the future. Dev said he's going to make sure that Lalita continues going to school. They are happy, they said, and have no regrets. ""We are both fine,"" Lalita said. ""If society thinks otherwise, let them."" Why do honor murders still happen?

"(CNN) -- Georgian authorities foiled an attempted army mutiny that they believe was designed to disrupt planned NATO exercises in the former Soviet republic, the country's interior ministry said Tuesday. Georgian troops take part in military exercises in January. They are to participate in NATO maneuvers this week. About 500 troops at a military base outside the capital, Tbilisi, were involved in the rebellion, said Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili. He said it was quickly brought under control, and the government reported a few hours later that the base was calm. Initial investigations suggest that Russia, Georgia's northern neighbor and former ruler, may have had a hand in the mutiny, Utiashvili said. Russia denied involvement in the incident. ""Tbilisi has pulled yet another anti-Russian prank. ... This is not the first time we are so vocally blamed for interfering. It is typical that each time the charges become more ridiculous,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Utiashvili claimed that Georgia had secret recordings of the mutineers saying they had ""full Russian support."" ""We know Russia is against the planned NATO exercises in Georgia. We know they have increased the troops at the border. We don't have 100 percent evidence right now, because the investigation is ongoing,"" he said. But, he added, until the investigation is complete, officials won't point a finger at Russia. On Tuesday afternoon, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili called on Russia to stop ""provocative maneuvers"" in Georgia, according to Georgia's English-language Prime News. Russia and Georgia fought a five-day war in August over the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia, the first time Russia sent troops abroad in anger since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. NATO is expected to launch month-long military exercises this week in Georgia. The move has angered Russia, which accused the alliance of ""muscle-flexing."" ""All kinds of things have been said,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. ""But it has never before been claimed that Russia is trying to overthrow the Georgian government with the help of the Georgian armed forces. In this regard, we once again reiterate that Russia does not interfere in the internal affairs of Georgia on principle. We do not believe in scripts imposed from the outside."" NATO said it had no comment on the incident because it did not independently confirm the event. However, a NATO spokeswoman in Brussels said Tuesday that exercises planned for Wednesday are ""still on"" and that ""nothing has changed"" after the attempted mutiny. ""The timing chosen by Tbilisi for its latest action is telling: the day before the start of NATO exercises in Georgia,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. ""We strongly warned our partners that the exercises were absolutely inappropriate in the current highly charged atmosphere within Georgia and the region. Our warnings were not heeded."" Georgia's Utiashvili said the rebelling soldiers were heard saying they were ""unhappy with the political situation in the country."" One person was arrested, and authorities are looking for another in connection with the attempted mutiny, Georgia's Ministry of Internal Affairs said. The person in custody, Gia Ghvaladze, served as a major in the Special Forces Department at the now-disbanded Ministry of State Security, Georgian officials said. He is being held on charges of organizing a military mutiny. In an undercover tape released by Georgian officials, a man is heard saying, ""Russians will come. About 5,000 men, two battalions. Can you imagine? Five thousand men. Do you know how big this is?"" CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the tape, but the Georgian government said it implicates Ghvaladze. Authorities said they are looking for the second man, Koba Otanadze, who is wanted for his role in organizing the mutiny. Otanadze helped lead a military mutiny at the same base in May 2001, the Ministry of Internal Affairs said. A third person -- Zaza Mushkudiani, the head of the Georgian ranger battalion -- was also being investigated, the ministry said, but it was unclear whether he was in custody. NATO is expected to launch month-long military exercises this week in Georgia. The move has angered Russia, Georgia's neighbor to the north, which accused the alliance of ""muscle-flexing."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov postponed his trip to Brussels, Belgium, for the ministerial meeting of the NATO-Russia Council because of the planned NATO exercises, Lavrov told the Itar-Tass news agency. In April, Saakashvili vowed to remain in office until his term ends, defying calls by anti-government protesters that he step down. Up to 60,000 demonstrators took to the streets, blaming the president for leading the country with Russia and plunging it into a political crisis. They also were angry about rising poverty in the country. CNN's Matthew Chance and Nunu Japaridze contributed to this report.","NEW: Georgian authorities release recording of man saying ""Russia will come""

"(CNN)  -- Pirates off the eastern coast of Somalia picked the wrong target this week when they tried to attack a U.S. Navy ship, the Navy said Thursday. Pirates off the coast of Somalia tried to attack the USNS Lewis and Clark on Wednesday. The attempted attack happened Wednesday against the USNS Lewis and Clark, a dry cargo and ammunition ship that supports the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet and coalition ships in the area, the Navy said. Two pirate skiffs pursued the Lewis and Clark for more than an hour as it headed north, the Navy said. They got as close as one nautical mile from the ship. The Lewis and Clark sped up and tried to escape the pirates, and the ship's security team issued verbal warnings to the approaching skiffs, the Navy said. The suspected pirates, who were then two nautical miles behind the Lewis and Clark, fired small arms at the ship. They fell a mile short of the ship's stern, the Navy said. The Lewis and Clark sped up and the skiffs stopped their chase. ""The actions taken by Lewis and Clark were exactly what the U.S. Navy has been recommending to prevent piracy attacks -- for both commercial and military vessels,"" said Capt. Steve Kelley, commander of Task Force 53, assigned to the Lewis and Clark. ""Merchant mariners can and should use Lewis and Clark's actions as an unequivocal example of how to prevent a successful attack from occurring,"" he said. Evasive maneuvers and other defense measures such as on-board security teams have worked to protect other ships and their cargo, the Navy said. That was the case late Wednesday morning in the Gulf of Aden, when a Greek vessel fended off a pirate attack. The Greeks hit the approaching skiff, causing the pirates' boat to capsize, the European Union's Maritime Security Center said in a written statement. A Spanish crew recovered seven pirates from the water and detained them, the statement said. No casualties or damage was reported. A Dutch cargo crew in the Gulf of Aden wasn't so lucky Thursday, the maritime center said. The small cargo vessel was hijacked, likely by Somali pirates, while sailing west in the transit corridor. The crew of eight Dutch sailors, who had Coca-Cola on board, altered the craft's course toward Somalia, the center said. The crew is believed to be unhurt. More than 30,000 vessels transit the Gulf of Aden each year, the Navy said. So far this year, there have been 97 attempted attacks on merchant vessels, 27 of which have been successful, the Navy said. The Lewis And Clark is one of six dry cargo/ammunition ships in the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command, which delivers supplies to the U.S. military around the globe. The ship also supported the counter-piracy task force in the area earlier this year, the Navy said.","Pirates fired small arms at USNS Lewis and Clark .

"Washington (CNN) -- The government wasted billions of dollars this year by allowing questionable tax breaks and paying for unnecessary programs even as the economy faltered, a Republican senator charged in a report released Monday. In his ""Wastebook 2012"" report, Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma pointed to 100 items including tax breaks to highly profitable sports leagues like the NFL, NASA funding to develop meals for a Mars mission that may not take place for decades and thousands of dollars for scientists to build a ""robosquirrel"" to see if rattlesnakes would try to eat it. Coburn, a longtime crusader against waste, said better prioritizing and oversight could have saved taxpayers $18.9 billion on the programs included in the report, which was based largely on existing government studies, inspector generals' findings and media reports. The White House's Office of Management and Budget ""share(s) Sen. Coburn's commitment to cutting out waste and will continue to fight to prevent such spending wherever we find it,"" agency spokeswoman Moira Mack said. ""Between 2010 and 2012, the president proposed to Congress to eliminate, cut or save money in 228 government programs and the administration has already been successful in more than half of those,"" she added. ""Where Congress has not acted, the president has moved aggressively through executive action to tackle unnecessary or excess spending."" Declaring that he works alongside ""compulsive spenders"" on Capitol Hill, Coburn in his report writes that with the struggling economy and the uncertainty of the looming fiscal cliff, it is imperative lawmakers reduce wasteful spending. ""Some try to rationalize the excessive borrowing and spending as necessary until the economy gets back on track,"" the second term Republican said. ""But the increased demand for help is precisely why Washington must be more careful how tax dollars are spent to ensure we can care for those who are truly in need."" The report includes a National Science Foundation grant for $325,000 for university researchers in California to develop a robotic squirrel to observe how rattlesnakes react, to study the interaction between predators and prey. The snakes appeared to accept the ""robosquirrel"" as real with one snake even biting off its head, CNN reported about the study in April. The report cites $27 million spent by the U.S. Agency for International Development to train Moroccans to make and sell pottery around the world. But the report, which cited a USAID inspector general report, says the program was riddled with problems, including having a translator at classes who was not fluent in English, and by using dyes and clay not available in that country. The study is critical of the continued production of the copper penny, which now costs more than two cents to make. It complains about $516,000 spent on a video game that simulates the social experience of attending a prom, $31,000 for Smokey Bear balloons to make appearances at balloon festivals, $300,000 to promote domestically produced caviar, and $268 million spent on a loophole for paper manufacturers that allows them to claim a waste byproduct is an alternative energy source. The report is critical of what it calls a professional sports loophole that allows leagues to be treated like trade or association groups and be exempt from federal income taxes on earnings. ""Hardworking taxpayers should not be forced to provide funding to offset tax giveaways to lucrative professional sports teams and leagues,"" says the report, which estimates getting rid of the loophole would bring $91 million into the treasury. Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the NFL, said the league office itself ""is classified as a not-for-profit under the tax code because the league office makes no profit."" He said the teams make the profits and they are taxed. Coburn put much of the blame for the wasteful spending on Congress, which he described as deeply ineffectual and disliked by the America people.

"(CNN) -- Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric, was unhappy that the Labor Department reported a 0.3 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate on Friday. In fact, he was sufficiently unhappy that he accused the Obama administration of using its control over the Labor Department to cook the numbers in a tweet just after the unemployment rate was reported. He even repeated the claim in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday. Perhaps Welch could get away with this sort of temper tantrum nonsense when he was running one of the biggest companies in the world, but he will only get ridicule pushing this line in policy debates. Either Welch doesn't have any clue about how the unemployment data are collected, or he is just a liar. First, it is important to understand that the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- the division of the Labor Department that reports data on unemployment -- is run by career civil servants. Ordinarily, the commissioner is a well-respected academic economist who is appointed by the president. However, since the previous commissioner left this year, John Galvin, a career civil servant, stepped up to fill the role of acting commissioner. This means the bureau does not have a single political appointee. Fortune: Welch says he's quitting . It is also important to understand the way the data for the survey are compiled and published. The survey involves hundreds of people at various stages in the process of collecting and compiling the data. Even if Galvin or some other top official in the bureau wanted to lie about the numbers, they couldn't possibly do it alone. Suppose they just changed the unemployment rate from a ""true"" rate of 8.1% to a bogus 7.8% rate. They would have the problem that this 7.8% number was inconsistent with the data on unemployment rates for whites and African-Americans. Or it would turn out to be inconsistent with the data on unemployment for young people and old people. If the perp just changed the overall unemployment rate, hundreds of experts would quickly find that numbers did not add up. The drop in the unemployment rate would not be consistent with other data in the survey. This would be easily detected. In order to successfully manipulate the data, it would be necessary to change hundreds of numbers that get reported each month. This would require the cooperation of dozens of top people at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Maybe in Welch's world, it is possible to go around with a big wad of money and buy off people at the drop of a hat, but the idea that someone from the Obama administration wandered through the top echelons of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to buy their cooperation in fixing the unemployment numbers is absurd on its face. Perhaps someone could be found who would be willing to be bought, but the rest would be singing their story on the national news. The other problem with Welch's charge is that he obviously has no knowledge of the unemployment series itself. In fact, it is common for the numbers to jump around. He found it incredible that the unemployment rate fell by 0.5 percentage points over two months when the economy appears to be growing slowly. How about when it fell by 0.7 percentage points from November 2010 to January 2011, when growth was also very weak? Was this political manipulation of the data? On the other side, the unemployment rate jumped by 0.2 percentage points in the summer of 1996, when the economy was growing at a 7.1% annual rate. If Welch knew the data at all or bothered to talk to someone who knew the data before he made his outlandish charges, he would realize that the unemployment rate is an erratic series. It moves around in unpredictable ways. I am on record as saying that Friday's drop in the unemployment rate was a statistical fluke. So was the 0.1 percentage point rise reported for July. But the economy has been adding 150,000 jobs per month, which is consistent with a declining unemployment rate. To get a full picture of the economy, you have to study the all the data and try to put together pieces of the puzzle. That may not fit Welch's political agenda, but that is the world we live in. The economists and statisticians at the Bureau of Labor Statistics may not be the most exciting people in the world, but they are honest. And for that, we should be very grateful. When we get data from them, we know that it has not been doctored for political purposes. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York police officer is under investigation after a video emerged showing him beating a 21-year-old man at a community center in Brooklyn, police said Monday. The incident occurred at 5 a.m. on October 8, after police received a call about a dispute at the ALIYA Center in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, police said. There, police came upon Ehud Haleavy, who refused to leave the women's portion of the center, the statement said. ""The officers used force"" to make the arrest, and Haleavy was charged with assault, trespass, resisting arrest, harassment and unlawful possession of marijuana, according to the statement, from Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne. The incident was caught on camera and obtained by CNN from CrownHeights.info. The video shows a bare-chested, bearded man talking with two officers -- one of them a woman -- in what appears to be a game room containing a pool table and two couches. The video shows the officers approaching Haleavy, who is on one of the couches, and talking to him. Moments later, he stands and talks with the officers, gesticulating with his arms but making no apparent threat toward either officer. The video has no sound. When the officers attempt to grab him by his arms, Haleavy pulls free of their grasp. At that, the male officer, 41, crouches into a boxing stance and hits the victim more than a dozen times, striking him in the face, the back of his head and his torso. Haleavy falls back into a couch, where he raises his arms in an apparent attempt to deflect the blows, but at no point does it appear that he is seeking to strike either officer. Later in the video, the female officer can be seen striking Haleavy repeatedly with a truncheon. More than three minutes into the video, about 10 more officers enter the room, where they cuff Haleavy's wrists behind his back and lead him out. ""This video does not indicate New York's finest,"" Assemblyman Dov Hikind said. ""You begin to wonder how often things like this happen."" Haleavy ""keeps his arms down and in back of him, but he is the one who gets arrested with felonies against a police officer,"" Hikind said. ""It's just lies, lies, lies."" The department's Internal Affairs Bureau has opened an investigation into the incident after reviewing the video, according to Browne. The matter was also referred to the Civilian Complaint Review Board. ALIYA -- an acronym for Alternative Learning Institute for Young Adults -- seeks to serve ""spiritual, physical, educational, emotional and vocational needs of young adults in the Crown Heights community,"" according to its website.","Video shows male officer hitting suspect dozens of times .

"(CNN) -- High U.S. taxes and political indecision are hindering the country's economic recovery, the head of General Electric has told CNN. In an exclusive interview, Jeff Immelt, chief executive of one of the country's largest companies, said he wanted the tax structure streamlined. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company has a market capitalization of $240 billion and has faced criticism over its tax payments. But Immelt told CNN the U.S. should reform its system to match those of competing economies. The U.S. needs to ""allow this territorial system [excusing repatriated profits from being subject to domestic taxes] so that companies can repatriate their earning back to the United States. That's the way Germany does it. That's the way Japan does it. That's the way the UK does it,"" Immelt said. Taxes should be paid based on where profits are made, Immelt added. ""We will sell more gas turbines in the next ten years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia than the United States by far."" he said. ""I would rather sell all my gas turbines in Chicago. It's easier, right? We don't go there because tax dodgers or anything like that. That's where the business is. That creates American jobs."" The U.S. corporation tax rate, based on where a company is headquartered, sits at 39% compared with the UK at 24%, Singapore at 17% and Ireland at 12.5%. Immelt, who is also chair of General Electric, said he believed the tax rate should be around 25%, and that ultimately ""we just would like to have the same tax policy as every other country in the world."" The existing tax structure is having a "" hugely negative impact "" on the country's economy as does the lack of fiscal clarity, he said. ""People need certainty, and I think it does not help when you're sitting here in October; and you've got a fiscal cliff at the end of the year."" There is a ""disconnect"" between the U.S. people and public policy, he said. ""If you walk through a factory in Ohio, people know what they want. They're not divided. If you walk through a factory in Illinois, people know what they want. They're not divided."" Politicians have ""got to get decisions made"" to bring down the national deficit, he said. The public debt of the world's largest economy currently stands at $11.3 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. However, the U.S. is ""more competitive today than anytime,"" Immelt said. ""Labor is very competitive, the companies are relatively strong on a global basis, and our exports are growing. I think there is a lot in the U.S. and the entrepreneurial spirit is still there."" The country is also making strides in gas, Immelt noted. ""Gas has become plentiful. I mean the gas finds are amazing,"" he said. Oil will, however, remain the fuel of choice for powering cars and other consumer products in the foreseeable future, he added. And as a burgeoning middle class emerges in developing nations, particularly in Asia and Latin America, Immelt says the price of oil is likely to remain at current levels with crude oil at around $90 a barrel. ""Oil tends to be harder to find today and therefore I think oil pricing could stay relatively high,"" he said. It's likely to say at ""historic highs versus gas for a period of time,"" he added.","The U.S. has one of the highest corporation tax rates in the world at 39% .

"(CNN) -- The sole survivor of a 2007 Connecticut home invasion has remarried, his father said Tuesday. Dr. William Petit Jr. and photographer Christine Paluf were married Sunday, Petit's father told CNN in a telephone interview. They met while she was volunteering for the Petit Family Foundation, he said. The couple became engaged shortly after Christmas, family friend Ann Baldwin told CNN in January. The foundation was established after Petit's first wife and their two daughters were killed in the family's home in Cheshire, Connecticut. To honor their memories, the foundation funds programs for education and for those affected by chronic illness and violence, according to its website. In the 2007 incident, two men entered the Petit home, beat and tied up William Petit and forced Jennifer Hawke-Petit to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000. The men then raped and strangled Hawke-Petit, 48, and molested 11-year-old Michaela before tying her and 17-year-old Hayley to their beds and setting the house afire. The girls died from smoke inhalation but their father managed to escape from the basement. Joshua Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes, who had met at a halfway house, were tried and have been sentenced to death. Death sentence in Connecticut home invasion .

"(CNN) -- Your grown-up kids aren't coming home for Christmas. They're all married, and it's the in-laws' turn to host dinner in another state. Or your divorce is finally final, and your ex has the kids this year. Yes, you can celebrate a few days later, but what do you do on Christmas?

"(CNN) -- A week after dismissing the nation's prime minister, Libya's General National Congress late Sunday selected a new man -- Ali Zeidan -- to assume the post. Mohamed al-Magariaf, the head of the North African nation's national assembly, announced Zeidan's ascension to prime minister in a statement Sunday. He got 93 votes from Libyan lawmakers, eight more than his closest contender, Mohammed al-Harary. Zeidan, a former diplomat, has been given an October 28 deadline to form an interim government. Last Sunday, the same congress rejected Prime Minister-elect Mustafa Abushagur's crisis government proposal, resulting in his automatic dismissal less than a month after he was appointed. The vote was overwhelmingly against Abushagur's plan, with 125 voting ""no confidence,"" 44 ""confidence"" and 17 abstaining. Libyans went to the polls three months ago to elect GNC members -- the nation's first elected body in almost half a century -- with expectations of change and progress that elected officials could bring about. Now public frustration is mounting with the lack of security, the slow process of creating a strong army and police force and rebuilding the country after the ouster of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. Read more: Libyan militias melt into desert, wait for another day . Born in Waddan, a Saharan desert town in central Libya, the embattled country's new prime minister was educated in India and served as a Libyan diplomat from 1975 to 1982, according to the official Libyan News Agency. Zeidan left Gadhafi's government that year and joined the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, a prominent left-leaning opposition group. And in 1989, he became the official spokesman of the Libyan League for Human Rights. With Gadhafi's ouster, Zeidan returned to assume roles in his native country, including as the National Transitional Council's envoy to France. Read more: U.S. sends new acting ambassador to Libya .

"(CNN) -- Fatma Nabil made history Sunday as she became the first veiled woman to read the news on Egyptian state television. She wore an off-white hijab, or headscarf. Veiled news anchors were not permitted to appear on state TV under the rule of Hosni Mubarak -- a longtime strongman forced from office last year. The ban was lifted by Salah Abdel-Maqsoud, Egypt's information minister and a member of the long-suppressed Muslim Brotherhood. ""Finally! The revolution has reached Maspero,"" said Nabil, according to the information ministry. She was referring to the headquarters of the state TV and broadcast building, which was the site of massive demonstrations during the uprising that toppled Mubarak. Nabil was a former anchor on a Muslim Brotherhood channel. The ban on veiled anchors was issued in 2002 by the then-information minister, Safwat El-Sherif. He was arrested shortly after the Mubarak regime fell, and faces corruption charges.","Wearing an off-white headscarf, Fatma Nabil makes history .

"(CNN) -- Alvin E. Roth of Harvard University and Lloyd Shapley of UCLA have been awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for their work in market design and matching theory, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Monday. Roth and Shapley's work focuses on finding the most efficient way to match parties in a transaction, whether it be students to schools or organ donors to recipients, according to the academy. Shapley used game theory to study matching models, and Roth built on them to make real-world changes to existing markets, including school choice and organ transplants, the academy said. Elements of their work are built into software that guides kidney donations in the United States, as well as in school choice models in New York, Boston, New Orleans and other U.S. cities, Roth told reporters Monday. Roth, who was awakened by an early morning call about their win, said he was not expecting the prize but was honored to share it with Shapley. ""I'm sure when I go to the class this morning my students will pay more attention,"" he said. The economics prize is the sixth and final of the annual awards that spotlight the world's top scholars and peacemakers. The economics award was not among the original prizes created in 1895 by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel to honor work in physics, medicine, chemistry, literature and peace. It was added as a category in 1969 by the Swedish central bank in memory of the industrialist. As such, the economics prize is given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, following the same principles used to determine the other Nobel Prize winners, according to the Nobel committee. The monetary award that accompanies the Nobel Prize was lowered by the foundation this year by 20% from 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.5 million) to 8 million kronor ($1.2 million) because of the turbulence that hit the financial markets. The economics selection follows last week's awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union, a selection that surprised many and drew scorn from Italian and Greek demonstrators who took to the streets to protest austerity measures. Opinion: Nobel Committee wasted an opportunity in its Peace Prize . The 27-nation union was honored for its work in promoting democracy and reconciliation following World War II, even as it grapples with a financial crisis that threatens to break the EU apart. Opinion: Why Europe deserved Peace Prize . ""The Nobel committee is a little late for an April fools joke,"" said Martin Callanan, leader of the Conservatives and Reformists party in the European Parliament. While Callanan called the Nobel committee ""out of touch,"" others applauded the selection. Another surprise was the Nobel committee's selection of Chinese writer Mo Yan as the winner of the Nobel Prize for literature. The Chinese author, whose pen name means ""not talking,"" has captivated his countrymen by intertwining fantasy and gritty everyday life. Mo, a Communist Party member, is considered a writer within the system and has embraced official party restrictions on writing. He also was elected by the Communist Party to a vice chairman spot in the state-sanctioned China Writers Association. Unlike the news blackout in China two years ago when Chinese dissident Liu Xiabo won the Nobel Peace Prize, state-run media reported Mo's win immediately following the announcement. Patrick Poon of the Independent Chinese Pen Center said the award by the Nobel committee appeared to be a recognition of -- or attempt to please -- the Chinese government. This year's prize for economics was selected from among hundreds of nominations, the Nobel committee said. Two Americans shared the prize last year for their study of the cause-and-effect relationship between government and economic policy. Thomas Sargent, a professor at New York University, and Christopher Sims, a professor at Princeton University, carried out their research independently, though their work was considered complementary. Sargent and Sims received their doctorates from Harvard in 1968. Read more: Nobel Peace Prize winner rips into fellow laureate over corruption .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- All retired Gurkha soldiers who served in the British Army will be allowed to settle in Britain, the British government announced Thursday, marking a victory for campaigners and a major shift in official policy. Former Gurkha solider Tulbahadur Pun was awarded Britain's highest honor for bravery, the Victoria Cross. The new rules announced by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith apply to about 36,000 retired Gurkhas who have served more than four years in the U.K. armed forces. Gurkhas will also be allowed to settle in Britain with their spouses and any children younger than 18, she said. Smith said she would instruct the U.K. Border Agency to speed up the processing of their applications. ""I'm delighted that we have now been able to agree across government, across the house and with the Gurkhas' representatives new settlement rights that all those who have served us so well so highly deserve,"" Smith told the Commons. Campaigners listening to Smith's announcement from outside Parliament cheered the news, which comes after years of pushing for greater rights for the Nepalese brigade. ""Today, a great injustice has been righted,"" said actress Joanna Lumley, who has been a fierce campaigner for Gurkhas' rights.  Watch Gurkhas salute the victory » . Gurkhas are Nepalese soldiers who have been part of the British Army for nearly 200 years. They have fought alongside the British Armed Forces in every conflict in that period, including both world wars, and are known for their ferocity and pride. Despite their centuries of service, Gurkhas were not given the right to settle in the United Kingdom until 2004. And even then the order applied only to those discharged after the British handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, when the Gurkhas Brigade moved from Hong Kong to Britain. Last month, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced new rules under which those who retired before 1997 would be allowed to live in the United Kingdom, but Lumley and others complained the rules were too restrictive and would only allow about 4,000 of the soldiers to make the move. Lumley, whose father served in the Gurkhas while she was a girl, said the new criteria could not be met by the average Gurkha. Less than a week after announcing the new rules, however, Brown suffered a stinging defeat in Parliament over the new rules. Even some members of his own Labor Party broke with Brown and voted to give all Gurkhas the equal right to live in Britain. ""What could be greater than for us to be able to open our arms and say, 'The Gurkhas are coming!'"" Lumley said. ""I am a daughter of the regiment and this is a proud day,"" she said. Lumley, who met with Brown in the morning, before the announcement, said the prime minister assured her there were ""no sneaky paragraphs"" or fine print in the legislation. The Gurkha brigade originated in the 19th century with Nepalese soldiers, who impressed the British imperial troops with their ferocity and military ability. The first Gurkha units were formed in 1815. They saw action in both world wars and were fundamental to the British military maintaining control of India in the 1800s. Today there are 3,400 troops in the Gurkha brigade, operating from bases in Britain. Most recently, Gurkha troops were used in the Persian Gulf War and the Balkan conflicts.","British government to allow Gurkha troops to settle in the UK .
