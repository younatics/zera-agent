These are just some of the historic Radio Times Christmas front covers from the last 90 years. From a family round the fire, to a red-breasted robin perched on a holly tree - the Christmas editions of the iconic TV listings magazine have featured numerous festive scenes throughout the years. The first set of covers from 1923 is a colour . illustration of a family sitting together around the radio together. In the beginning: The very first Christmas cover, left, of Radio Times from 1923 and right, the 1924 edition. The publication is celebrating its 90th anniversary this year . It was the first ever edition of the publication to feature a colour front cover and was a roaring success - despite the then editor voicing concerns it may put readers off. Santa . Claus didn't appear on the cover until 1940, when he . was wearing a helmet in support for the troops fighting in the Second World War. Despite his slow start, Father Christmas has appeared on the most covers - a grand total of 13 issues. Celebrities . have also featured and a period of the 1970s strayed from the tradition hand . drawn design to photographs of icons such as the Two Ronnies, Morecambe . and Wise and Frank Spencer. Party season: The 1925 cover, left, features a couple having a festive dance while the edition from 1933 is particularly striking with its red, white and blue theme . First appearance: Santa graces the front cover for the first time in 1940. The cover from 1953 depicts a traditional scene of children waiting for Father Christmas to arrive . This year's . cover is a modern take on the 1920s illustrated cover but includes a favourite television character - Raymond Briggs' Father Christmas from . the animation the Snowman. The Radio Times is one of the most . popular British magazines and even received a Guinness World Record in . 1988 for selling over 11.2 million copies that year. Deputy Editor and art director Shem Law believes it has become an integral part of the British Christmas experience. Rockin' robin: The 1957 edition features a splendid red-breasted robin happily holding holly in its beak while 1965's cover sees a rather abstract geometric design . Patterned: The cover from 1967 shows an elaborate festive coloured front cover while 1973's edition sees Morecambe and Wise and The Two Ronnies . Crackers: Frank Spencer poses for the 1974 edition while the scene on the 1988 front cover, featuring a ballerina and a jester, is a rather whimsical affair . He . said: 'The Christmas Radio Times is a tradition and is very, very . British. It is part of the national psyche and plays an important part . of everyone's Christmas. 'I . remember there always being a copy in my house growing up and without me . even realising it has become a tradition in my own home for my four . children. 'It is the only Radio Times issue that people will always go out of their way to buy.' Mr Law added: 'A key part of a British . Christmas is the family sitting together watching television - circling . their favourite programmes in the magazine and debating with the family . what will be watched on each day. Santa's here!

To celebrate the return of . Sherlock, this year Radio Times have teamed up with Penguin to give away a free . copy of The Return of Sherlock Holmes with the double issue. Shem .

The Radio Times Cover Story is available from shop.radiotimes.com starting at Â£20 for the paperback. Radio Times was first printed on 28 . September 1923. When it launched an issue cost 2d - two old pennies. It only went up to three pennies in 1951. The magazine only carried broadcast listings for BBC radio and television channels until TV channels were deregulated in 1991. The ITV-published magazine, TVTimes, carried only ITV and then, from 1982, Channel 4 television listings. Today both publications carry listings for all major channels. Following deregulation, there was outcry from other listings magazines that Radio Times was advertised on the BBC which gave an unfair advantage to the publication. In the past, there has been controversy around the magazine featuring mainly BBC shows on its front cover - with Dr Who appearing on 29 issues. Since Christmas 1969, a double-sized . issue - hailed as 'Legendary' by the magazine's publishers - has been . released each December containing listings for two weeks of programmes. Originally, this covered both Christmas and New Year listings but in . some years these appear in separate editions. It was, at one time, the biggest selling publication in Europe.

The mass panic occurred on Christmas Eve when security guards at Macy's at the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island wrestled with someone they believed was a thief. Witnesses spoke of hearing several loud booming sounds that reverberated around the shopping center when the fight broke out. Panic: Chaos ensued after Macy's security guards wrestled with a suspected thief . Panic: Hundreds of shoppers streamed towards the exits after mistaking the shoplifting suspect for a gunman . Thinking it was gunfire, hundreds of people stampeded out of the mall, fearing for their lives. Some were so frightened they were reduced to tears and outside people hugged each other for comfort. In fact, the loud noises were caused by an display case being knocked over. The mall closed temporarily amid the chaos, but Nassau County police officers on patrol in the mall quickly restored  calm. One witness told CNN: 'With people running and screaming, your first thought is ""just get out of here"".' Another said: 'Watching that many people move, at that pace, is very concerning.

David Cameron is promoting the Christian values of Christmas in his sermon, praising those who help their communities . David Cameron will today issue a highly religious Christmas message in a bid to rescue his Big Society concept. The Prime Minister praises those who help out in their communities for putting ‘their faith into action’, saying: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive’. Mr Cameron once likened his Anglican faith to the reception of Magic FM in the Chilterns, admitting that ‘it comes and goes’. But he is keen to reaffirm his Christianity in his message today, showing that he is more than happy to ‘do God’. ‘For me, this season is a time to think about the meaning of Christmas – the birth of Jesus Christ and the hope that gives to millions,’ he says. ‘In Handel’s Messiah, these words from the Prophet Isaiah are brilliantly put to music: “His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace”.’ Mr Cameron also invokes scripture in a bid to revive the Big Society, his concept that charities and other groups should step in to help at times of austerity, which failed to win over voters at the election. The idea has been periodically revived but many Tory MPs believe that the Prime Minister’s failure to explain it properly to voters helped to cost him a majority in 2010. ‘There are those millions who keep on strengthening our society too – being good neighbours, running clubs and voluntary associations, playing their part in countless small ways to help build what I call the “big society”,’ he says. ‘Many of these people are Christians who live out to the letter that verse in Acts, that “it is more blessed to give than to receive”. These people put their faith into action and we can all be grateful for what they do.’ Mr Cameron also uses his message to reflect on the past year, claiming that the country has pulled together in tough times. The remarks will also be seen as an attempt to revive the Big Society concept . He says: ‘Looking back, 2013 has been a year when our country pulled together to overcome the challenges we face. ‘Together we have made real progress on strengthening our economy and creating more decent jobs so that people can provide for their families. ‘This progress is down to the efforts of millions who go out and work hard every day, putting in the hours, running businesses and keeping our economy going.’ Mr Cameron welcomes the arrival of Justin Welby as the new Archbishop of Canterbury and Pope Francis. ‘Both have come in with exciting plans to rejuvenate their respective churches, which should inspire Christians around the world,’ he says. The Prime Minister also praises the ‘brave service women and men who are helping bring peace here and around the world’ and those in ‘the emergency and caring services who are working hard to support those in need  this Christmas’. More than Christanity: Ed Miliband (left) and Nick Clegg (right), who both don't believe in God, stress the importance of spending time with family in their Christmas messages . In messages delivered by other party leaders, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, an avowed atheist, insists that Christmas is about more than Christianity. It is, of course, one of the biggest events in the Christian calendar – a time for hope, kindness, family, and goodwill,’ he says on video. ‘For Christians it is a celebration of the birth of Jesus as a gift from God and someone who embodied the values of love and forgiveness to which we should all aspire. But what is so extraordinary about this time of year is that it brings together the whole country – religious, non-religious, Christian, non-Christian – to embrace these values and celebrate together.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was raised in a Jewish family but is not a believer in God, made clear that his Christmas break would not have religious connotations. ‘Christmas is a special time of the year for many people,’ he says. ‘Lots of us take a break from the everyday pressures of work to spend time together with friends and family, strengthening the relationships that mean so much to us. ‘I would like to pay particular tribute to the many people, churches and charities who will be looking after those who are alone or homeless this Christmas time. ‘We should also pay tribute to those who will be working so that the rest of us have an enjoyable break, especially our medical staff, our police and our Armed Forces, thank you for your service.’ Mr Cameron’s Christian message comes after shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander suggested public figures have allowed ‘political correctness’ to prevent them talking about faith and the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, and Prince Charles warned that Christianity was beginning to ‘disappear’ from its own birthplace, as Islamists ‘deliberately target’ communities.","David Cameron has stressed Christian values of helping others in speech .

Luxury fashion house Chanel has lost a legal battle to trademark the word 'Jersey' for its new perfume after officials in the Channel Islands campaigned against it. The iconic French brand sought rights to the name because its founder Coco Chanel famously made clothes from jersey fabric. But Island officials were concerned that using the region's name with a capital 'J' would lead buyers to believe the fragrance was produced locally. The UK's intellectual property office's ruling means the name will be protected for Jersey farmers and small businesses. Officials from the Economic Development . Department were happy for Chanel to call its lavender scent 'Jersey' but wanted . to safeguard the title for locals. Senator Alan Maclean said: 'It was important that we challenged this. This was about ownership of the name Jersey. 'It is not about stopping Chanel using the name. It is fantastic to have a perfume named Jersey.' Geographical trademarking has been a thorn in the side of many big businesses. High-end fashion house Yves Saint . Laurent was forced to destroy Â£10million of publicity material for its . 'Champagne' fragrance in 1993. A . court ruled that the name infringed upon the protected status of the . famous wine that is produced in France's Champagne region. According to the Intellectual Property Office, there are 13 applications in . the UK asking for protected geographical status.

Customers could soon be able to pay cheques in to their bank account from the comfort of the armchairs under a new scheme being pushed by ministers. Instead of having to queue up at a bank to deposit a cheque, they will be able simply to take a photo of it on the smartphone and send it to their bank. It means the money will be in their account within two days rather than up to six as at present. Technology: Instead of having to queue up at a bank to deposit a cheque, they will be able simply to take a photo of it on the smartphone and send it to their bank . The Treasury will consult next year on whether to loosen the rules around cheques and enable hi-tech cheque clearing to be introduced in the UK. It will be a boon to all those who receive cheques from grandma at Christmas but have to traipse to the bank and then wait ages for the money to come through. And ministers promise that the older generation who may not have smartphones will still be able to deposit cheques in the traditional manner. Sajid Javid, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘This government is determined to create a banking sector that works for consumers and serves businesses. ‘We want to see more innovation so that customers see the benefits of new technologies. That is why we’re creating a new payments regulator and why we are going to consult on speeding up the cheque clearing process. ‘We want to take the very best of the current system and make it better. We want to cheques to have a crucial role in the ongoing success of the UK.’ Despite the advent of internet banking, cheques are still a crucial part of the British payments landscape. Nearly £840billion of cheques were processed last year, accounting for 10 per cent of all payments made by individuals. Crucial: Nearly £840billion of cheques were processed last year . Some 23million cheques were sent as gifts because they are still the most trusted method of sending money through the post. Businesses too rely on cheques: in 2012 they accounted for more than 370million cheque transactions. A quarter of payments made by small businesses were by cheque. The Treasury says however that it must take steps to secure their long term future. Next year, the government will consult on introducing legislation to speed up cheque payments to reinforce its relevance and trustworthiness in 21st century Britain. The cheque processing technology the Treasury wants to introduce here is already widely used in the US. In Britain, Barclays is planning to introduce cheque deposit on mobile phones next year. Customers without smartphones will be able to use similar technology at cashpoints or branches or continue to pay in paper as they do now. So-called ‘cheque imaging’ does not require a hard copy of the cheque to be present at every stage of the paying-in process. That means that time spent transferring it between different banks and central clearing depots is saved as well as reducing the overall costs. John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘Many of our members, and their customers, still rely on cheques so will be pleased with the investment and innovation to ensure their continued use. ‘Speeding up cheque payments into business accounts is to be welcomed as many find the current process frustratingly slow. Using smartphones is an interesting idea which should allow firms in areas, particularly where bank branches are closing, to be able to accept cheques as a method of payment.’ Steven Roberts, managing director of Barclays Bank, said: ‘We’re excited to be the first bank to pilot this new technology and always welcome legislation which enables the whole industry to work together to make customers lives easier. ‘These changes mean you will be able to pay cheques in instantly, not just in branch, but also using your smartphone or tablet computer. When you can download a book or a film in seconds, we believe you should be able to deposit a cheque in the same way. ‘We are planning to test the cheque imaging technology early in the New Year with a range of customers.’ Alan Smith, head of payments and banking services at the Post Office, said: ‘Post Office welcomes today’s announcement from government on next year’s consultation for cheque imaging. ‘This announcement is great news for our customers and will bring about a move for much needed improvements for clearing and processing cheques, including the move from paper to cheque imaging.’ Gillian Guy, chief execitive of Citizens Advice, said: ‘Cheques are an important, and sometimes vital, method of payment for many CAB clients. ‘It’s good to see plans to bring cheques into the modern age with digital imaging and faster payments being introduced, alongside continued use the more traditional paper cheques.  It’s important these developments don’t bring extra costs or barriers for consumers.’","The Treasury will consult next year on whether to loosen the rules .

But they are now just as likely to have spent Christmas Day gazing at a computer screen, experts say. For more people were expected to shop online yesterday than will venture out to the high street today, a poll shows. The survey by Barclaycard found that 31 per cent of adults planned to spend part of Christmas Day surfing for bargains while only 27 per cent planned to brave the Boxing Day sales. Bargain hunters: Almost a third of adults planned to spend some of yesterday shopping online, a survey found . This is because increasing numbers of retailers start their sales online on Christmas Day – or, in some cases, Christmas Eve. However, an estimated four million people are still expected to flock to the shops today, with more than £3 billion going through tills. Experts say it is now considered socially acceptable to shun family time on Christmas Day in favour of online shopping. Of those who went online yesterday, a third said they intended to wait until the evening when festivities were over, a fifth would shop during lulls in the day’s activities, but 12 per cent would shop in the early hours or immediately after opening their presents. A fifth of those shopping online yesterday said they would do it in a lull in festivities . Online spending is up nine per cent this Christmas – compared with a 1.2 per cent rise instore – as shoppers hunt the best prices. Barclaycard said shopping on Christmas Day has grown by about a quarter in the past two years. ‘The Boxing Day sales have traditionally been the day when we splash our Christmas cash,’ a spokesman said. ‘However, the relentless growth in online shopping – and ever-earlier sales – means that more and more of us are taking to the web on Christmas Day to secure the best bargains.’ Harvey Nichols, House of Fraser, Debenhams, PC World and John Lewis launched their online sales on Christmas Eve while Argos, Amazon and Selfridges started theirs on Christmas Day. Retail expert Clare Rayner said: ‘Once the gifts have been opened and the turkey has been consumed, browsing online offers people an alternative to the boredom of the same old movies. ‘Retailers selling online can now capitalise on consumers who might otherwise have avoided the crowds in the sales. We’ve seen reports of people having “sale-rage” over discounted items in shops and supermarkets. ‘Shopping in the sales online, for many, is far more civilised and for the retailers it helps to reduce the queues, the staffing costs and the chaos in stores without missing out on sales. ‘Shopping malls and centres are often not enjoyable places to be in a mad post-Christmas sale crush. The main retailers can offer click and collect, so their stores still play a vital role in consumer experience.’ Research by Experian, the credit checking group, predicted 45million hours will be spent on retail websites across Christmas Eve, yesterday and today.

Madness: Boxing Day shoppers last year in London's Oxford Street - but fewer are braving the sales in person . Despite the online Christmas Day spending boom, a record number of shops will open today. People were expected to start queuing in the early hours outside major department stores such as Selfridges, Harrods and Liberty. Extra security staff have been hired to try and head off a repeat of Black Friday. The one-day sale, across many stores late last month, was supposed to fuel excitement about the Christmas shopping season, but descended into hostile scenes, injuries and some arrests. The Boxing Day sales are far busier. A study by finance company Capital One suggests this may be because 45 per cent of shoppers have delayed buying Christmas gifts until today to save money. Psychologist Dr Dimitrios Tsivrikos, of University College London, said the cost-of-living crisis had fuelled shopper anxiety as people feel under pressure to beat others to the bargains. ‘It is an almost caveman instinct,’ he said. ‘Where at one time, early man was fighting over food in what was a life or death battle for survival, now they are fighting over mobile phones and flat-screen TVs.’","27 per cent plan to brave the sales today, fewer than those online yesterday .

Instead of discussing a raise - Salgado has been on $8.25 an hour for a decade - or offering health cover, the representative said Salgado, a full-time employee, 'definitely should be able to qualify for both food stamps and heating assistance.' Scroll down for video . Poverty: Chicago mother-of-two and 10-year McDonald's veteran Nancy Salgado, pictured, made a call to 'McResource' recently, asking for help paying her heating bill, feeding her children and getting her sister medical assistance . Advocacy group Low Pay Is Not OK recorded the phone call and circulated an edited version to flag up how many full-time fast-food workers are living in poverty - and McDonald's doesn't seem to care. McDonald's told CNN Money the video was 'not an accurate portrayal of the resource line' because it was 'very obviously' edited. However, CNNMoney reviewed the full recording of the call and reported that the helpline operator never asked Salgado how much she made per hour, and how many hours per week - though she knew she was full-time - she worked before recommending the government programs. The representative pointed her toward a number of resources in Chicago, such as food pantries and a program that would help cover some of her heating bill and said she would email her specific phone numbers and programs. Dispute: McDonald's told CNN Money the video was 'not an accurate portrayal of the resource line' because it was 'very obviously' edited . Protests: Fast-food workers staged strikes at McDonald's and protestested low wages in sixty U.S. cities including Los Angeles, pictured, in August . McDonald's told CNN that 'the McResource Line is intended to be a free, confidential service to help employees and their families get answers to a variety of questions or provide resources on a variety of topics including housing, child care, transportation, grief, elder care, education and more.' But according to the network, the hotline is not open to all McDonald's workers as franchise owners need to pay for the service in order for their employees to access it. The clearly dedicated operator said: 'We can be a good program. We can do a lot of the leg work that takes a lot of the stresses off of you making a million phone calls trying to find services.' News of Salgado's experience comes a week after a report found that more than half of fast food workers have to rely on public assistance programs because their wages aren't enough to support them. The report estimated that this public aid carries a $7 billion price tag for taxpayers each year. A separate report by the National Employment Law Project released on the same day showed that McDonald's alone was responsible for $1.2 billion of that $7 billion alone. Since last November, workers have been protesting their low pay in cities including New York City, Los Angeles, Memphis and Detroit. They are demanding a minimum wage of $15 an hour and the right to demonstrate without retaliation. On October 9, Salgado was arrested after she confronted the company president at a meeting and told him she couldnâ€™t afford to buy shoes or food for her children. She told The Real News that she felt like she had to speak out during McDonald's USA President Jeff Strattonâ€™s speech at the Union League Club of Chicago on Friday for the sake of her children. 'It's really hard for me to feed my two kids and struggle day to day,' she shouted as Stratton was speaking. 'Do you think this is fair, that I have to be making $8.25 when Iâ€™ve worked for McDonald's for 10 years?' He responded: 'I've been there for forty years.'","Chicago mother-of-two Nancy Salgado made a call to McDonald's staff helpline 'McResource' recently .

Grant Shapps (pictured) likened the Business Secretary to a 'rude uncle' who 'ruins Christmas' A senior Tory yesterday branded Vince Cable a ‘rude old uncle’ who ruins Christmas. Grant Shapps spoke out after the Lib Dem Business Secretary accused David Cameron of spreading panic on immigration like Enoch Powell. Other Conservatives demanded that the Prime Minister sack Mr Cable for his incendiary remarks on Sunday. The Business Secretary said the Tories’ ‘populist policies’ on immigration were damaging Britain and compared them to Mr Powell’s notorious 1968 Rivers of Blood speech. His comments came ahead of an expected influx of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria when restrictions are lifted on January 1. Yesterday Conservative chairman Mr Shapps said: ‘Vince Cable’s a bit like an old uncle at Christmas. ‘Slightly rude, does not always make sense, but he is part of the extended family so you have to live with it.’ Conservative MPs demanded a fight back by Downing Street, which has declined to fuel the row by denouncing Mr Cable. Many fear that if the claim is allowed to stand it could cost the Tories key votes, especially among ethnic minorities. Backbencher Peter Bone said Mr Cameron should defend his policies, which include ensuring that migrants cannot claim benefits for their first three months in the UK. ‘He’s got to come out and say we’re not the nasty party,’ he said. ‘We’re not racists, we’re not targeting foreigners. That’s completely and utterly ridiculous. 'Someone should be out there saying that. ‘If Vince Cable was a Conservative minister he would have been fired already. The idea that David Cameron is behaving like Enoch Powell is completely absurd.’ Fellow Tory Philip Davies said: . ‘Cable is appalled by his Government but he is very happy to keep taking . his fat Cabinet salary. I have nothing but contempt for him and his . duplicity.’ And . Nigel Mills, a Tory MP who wants greater restrictions on Romanians and . Bulgarians, said: ‘Just to leave radio silence isn’t really helping.' 'Some people might think we’re too scared to talk about this issue.’ The Liberal Democrat has been criticised by Conservatives for allegedly spreading panic on immigration . Mr Cable’s remarks are the latest in a long line of complaints about Tory policies – none of which have yet prompted him to resign. At the Lib Dem conference this year he made it known that he would not vote to back a motion calling for the maintenance of current Coalition deficit reduction plans, but he eventually caved in after pressure from Nick Clegg. Mr Cable also believes George Osborne has cut too deeply into public services and he has repeatedly denounced the Chancellor’s Help to Buy scheme aimed at help people get on the housing ladder. On Sunday he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that Home Secretary Theresa May’s desire to cap EU migrants at 75,000 a year was ‘illegal and impossible to implement’ and claimed Tory interventions are doing ‘a great deal of damage’ to Britain. ‘We periodically get these . immigration panics,’ he said. ‘I remember going back to Enoch Powell and . Rivers of Blood and all that, and if you go back a century there were . panics over Jewish immigrants.’ A . No 10 source said that Mr Cameron would not rise to Mr Cable’s abuse . because his attack has ‘so little credibility it isn’t worth it’. Britain’s . economy will pay a big price if the Conservatives meet their target of . getting annual net immigration below 100,000, a think-tank has warned. The . National Institute for Economic and Social Research said keeping . immigration numbers in five figures would slash 11 per cent off gross . domestic product by 2060. This is the equivalent of £165billion at today’s prices, or about £2,600 for every person in the country. Britain is accused of breaching almost 50 EU rules over items ranging from tractors to toys – and even garlic. In what will be seen as more meddling from Brussels, the Government is being pursued for failing to follow dozens of European Commission directives and other legal agreements. If ministers fail to address the allegations, lawsuits could end up in crippling fines at the European Court of Justice. One claim, concerning import duties on fresh garlic from China, was sent to the court in September. Eurocrats also want to take action over the delayed implementation of a directive about emissions from narrow track tractors, introduced by the Commission in February. Other complaints, about which few details have been disclosed, concern toy safety, the cleanliness of beaches, the energy performance of buildings and vehicles nearing their ‘end of life’. Details of the 47 legal actions, obtained under freedom of information laws from the Cabinet Office, will fuel the fierce debate about Britain’s role in Europe. Although David Cameron wants to renegotiate membership and has promised an ‘in or out’ referendum in 2017 if he remains in power, he faces pressure from his own party as well as eurosceptics in the UK Independence Party. London’s Tory mayor Boris Johnson wrote yesterday that no ‘positive case’ was being made for staying in the EU, which he said had become known for ‘agreeing standards for widgets’. And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ‘You only have to look at the list of proceedings to understand that the EU now regulates and controls every single, little aspect of our lives.’ A legal expert who advises ministers about infringement told the Daily Telegraph that such cases can drag on for years. Often the Commission has simply misunderstood the situation, he added. A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain has fewer so-called open infringements than other countries and supported the ‘timely and consistent’ application of EU law across the union.","Grant Shapps said Business Secretary 'ruins Christmas'

Small businesses could find it easier to borrow money under a shake-up of bank lending rules unveiled today. At present, many firms find it difficult to persuade the big four banks to lend them cash to enable them to expand their operations – hampering the growth of the economy. Strict rules mean it is harder for smaller ‘challenger’ banks to be able to lend firms money because they do not have access to the credit worthiness ratings of potential borrowers. The Treasury will propose that the big four banks - Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds (pictured) and RBS - should be forced to share credit worthiness ratings with other smaller lenders . The Treasury will today propose that the big four banks – Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS – should be forced to share these ratings with other lenders, making it  easier for small banks to provide  businesses with the cash they need. Sajid Javid, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘The Government is determined to build a banking system that  supports Britain’s economy and its small and medium sized businesses. ‘The best way to deliver this is to increase competition in the sector and remove  the barriers to new sources of finance for SMEs [small and medium enterprises]. Requiring banks to share data is an important part of creating a more level playing field that will enable more providers to enter the market.’ The Mail launched its Make The Banks Lend campaign three years ago after it emerged they were starving small firms of funds, choking off the recovery. But last month Britain’s two state-backed banks – Lloyds and RBS – were accused of ruining thousands of small firms by using ‘unscrupulous’ business practices. In a trap: At the moment, small business struggle to persuade the big four banks to lend them cash to enable them to expand their operations, which in turn hampers the economy . An independent report commissioned by the Government found that RBS had acted like a ‘hit squad’ by deliberately causing healthy businesses to go bust for its own gain. In the worst cases, the bank withdrew lines of credit for previously  solvent firms by charging high fees and charges so it could then seize their assets at knock-down prices. The new shake-up is an attempt to stamp down on such abuse. Ministers will today pledge to set up  a  consultation on new rules for sharing the credit data of small and medium enterprises. If these draft proposals are implemented, it will be easier for challenger banks  and alternative finance providers to  enter the market and provide credit to SMEs. Banks will be required to share small firms’ credit data through credit  reference agencies. Several bodies, including the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition  Commission, have all highlighted how a lack of information about the creditworthiness of small businesses has limited the number of providers of SME finance. As a result the big four high street banks control 85 per cent of SME lending. Improved access to this credit data, through greater competition and innovation in SME lending, should improve the cost and quality of services offered. Small firms are vital to the UK economy, accounting for over half of private sector employment and nearly half of all private sector turnover. The ability of SMEs to access finance is important for funding business investment, ensuring businesses reach their growth potential, and for facilitating new business start-ups. The consultation will invite views from stakeholders and the industry on the  policy proposals and will run until February 17, 2014. The Government then intends to bring forward legislation in the next session  of Parliament. The consultation follows an announcement in last year’s Budget that it would ‘investigate options for improving access to SME credit data to make it easier for newer lenders to assess applications for loans to smaller businesses’.","Treasury to propose Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS share ratings .

An elderly patient starved because a ‘nil by mouth’ sign meant for the previous occupant of her bed had not been removed. A damning report into care at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital also found that another elderly patient was left completely . naked on top of a soiled sheet, while others were forced to wet the bed . after their repeated calls for assistance went unanswered. A dementia patient was also left on the verge of malnutition because they were unable to reach food or drink left for them. The Royal Bournemouth Hospital in Dorset has received a damning hospital inspection report. Patients were found to have had fluids and food restricted by mistake while others were left lying in soiled or wet beds . The terrible treatment came to light after the Care Quality Commission, which inspects hospitals, visited in October. The two-day inspection singled out wards three and 26 for being particularly bad and understaffed. The report states the family of an elderly woman were surprised to find the ‘nil by mouth’ sign on her bed and were shocked when it was realised it wasn’t meant for her. Yet it took another five hours for the patient to be given water, such was the lack of staff on the ward. The report states: 'One person on ward 3 told us they had come to visit their relative and had been surprised to find they had a sign above their bed saying ""nil by mouth"", which told staff not to offer this patient food or fluids orally. 'The relative had questioned this with a nurse, who told them that their relative was due to undergo an investigation, which meant that they couldn’t eat or drink. 'They then asked the nurse to find out what this investigation was. When the nurse returned they said that the patient was not in fact meant to be ‘nil by mouth’ but that the sign had been left on the bed from a previous patient. 'This meant that the patient had missed breakfast and lunch, and had not received fluidssince their admission to the ward. 'The concerned relative went on to . say that although this mistake was discovered at 2pm, when they returned . to the ward at 7pm their relative had still not been given water to . drink.' The report also . highlights the case of a dementia patient who lost a significant amount . of weight because they were unable to reach their food just inches away. Despite the scathing report from the chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards (left),  Bournemouth chief executive Tony Spotswood (right) said there was no reason for him to resign . It reads: 'Despite them being able to eat independently, food and drinks had been left out of their reach and left to go cold. 'As a result, their relative had lost a significant amount of weight on the ward. 'When they asked about the weight loss they were told that staff had weighed their relative that morning and they had weighed 90 kilograms. 'As they felt that this did not seem correct, they asked staff to weigh them again. On that occasion they weighed 69 kilograms. 'They said that the ward had given their relative a Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) score of zero after the first weight was recorded, which needed to be changed to a three after the second weight was recorded. Dorothy Simpson, 84, telephoned her family from the hospital because she could not breathe, and died 20 minutes later . 'This score of three showed that their relative was at risk of malnutrition.' The Royal Bournemouth was one of the first to be inspected by the CQC in the wake of the Mid Stafforshire scandal, following complaints about the level of care there. The inspection found that nurses on ward three accepted staffing levels were ‘horrendous’. The chief inspector, Sir Mike Richards, concluded: 'The trust did not employ enough staff, even though it was fully aware that nearly all its beds were occupied all the time. Professor Sir Mike Richards, the Chief Inspector of Hospitals, . said: 'Whenever we inspect we will always ask the following five . questions of every service: Is it safe? Is it effective? Is it caring? Is it responsive to people's needs? Is it well-led? 'At . Royal Bournemouth Hospital, we were told about basic nursing care which . was not being given to patients on two medical care wards. We heard . from five patients who told us they had been left to wet or soil their . beds. 'The hospital had a high . occupancy rate and there had been ongoing use of escalation beds when a . ward or unit was full - even though these beds could not meet patients' needs properly. The 64-page document also said that stroke victims were 'not always given the urgent care they needed'. Surgical . services and outpatient departments also came under the microscope at . the hospital managed by The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals . NHS Trust, which serves 550,000 people. 'A number of services were not always safe, effective, responsive, caring or well-led,' stated the CQC report. 'In particular we found that medical care (including care older people's care) was inadequate. 'There were widespread and significant negative views from patients and staff.' The . outpatients' department was found to have infection control risks. The . main outpatient reception, the floor sinks and the waste bins in the . female toilets were not clean. The . sluice room - a specially designed cleaning room - was cluttered with . 'obsolete equipment' and stacked with used clinical dressing packs.

No doctors, no nurses, no tubes to be hooked up to, and definitely no hospitals. And as her mother, watching her lively three-year-old exploring under the Christmas tree, is delighted to say, Scarlett’s wish is coming true. In fact, this is the first Christmas her little girl will really be able to enjoy the magic of the season, free of the health problems that nearly cost her life. Home for Christmas: Three-year-old Scarlett Leybourne and her mother Ashleigh will be celebrating Christmas at home this year after Scarlett spent the last one in hospital because of a life-threatening heart condition . Scarlett Ungurs has been fighting for her life ever since she was diagnosed with a rare heart condition when she was just six months old. Placed at the top of the transplant list and kept alive by an artificial heart, doctors told her parents, Ashleigh Leybourne, 28, and Darren Ungurs, 34, to expect the worst. At their lowest ebb, the couple even started to make funeral arrangements. Even when Scarlett started to recover without having a transplant after her heart healed itself she then caught a nasty chest infection and she was once again forced to rely on an artificial heart. Luckily four months later Scarlett underwent a successful heart transplant and began making a full recovery. Now her mother has described her relief at having her daughter home in time for her fourth Christmas with an all clear. Scarlett was diagnosed with a rare condition aged just six months meaning her heart was enlarged . Close to death: Doctors didn't think she would make it to her first birthday and her parents even started making funeral arrangements as her health failed her . The family from Newcastle Upon Tyne, say they cannot wait to spend the day with her now there is no longer a need for Scarlett to be in kept isolation as she was last year. Miss Leybourne said: ‘We’re so excited for Christmas this year. We are going to spend the day with all of our family, which we couldn’t do last year because Scarlett was so ill she wasn’t allowed to come into contact with other people. ‘When she was ill we went from being a normal family to being in pieces. It was absolutely awful. ‘Then we thought she had recovered and she ended up in hospital again, we just couldn’t believe she had gone back to square one - well worse even. Alone: Last year Scarlett was so ill she had to be kept in hospital isolation as human contact could have killed her . Desperate: During her last illness Scarlett had to have operation virtually every day due to internal bleeding . Artificial heart: Machine kept Scarlett alive as surgeons worried she might not live long enough for a transplant . ‘We didn’t expect her to make it through - she was so ill. But now she has recovered we are just so relieved.’ Scarlett was born weighing a healthy 8lb 8oz in December 2010. But at six months she developed a persistent cough which was diagnosed as a chest infection. When her breathing got worse, a consultant changed suggested she was suffering from asthma, but it was only by chance that Scarlett was x-rayed by a trainee doctor who found that her heart was seriously enlarged. Scarlett was close to death, with her heart functioning at just four per cent, and she was hooked up to an artificial organ to keep her alive. As the family waited nervously for a transplant heart to become available, astonishingly Scarlett’s heart appeared to heal itself - a process only seen in 20 cases worldwide. Fighter: However Scarlett pulled through and will be spending Christmas at home with family this year . Thankful: Ashleigh says that without the kindness of a stranger donating their heart Scarlett wouldn't be here . But the happiness was short-lived when the youngster fell ill again just months later. Scarlett spent four months waiting for a transplant and underwent an operation almost daily while waiting, due to internal bleeding. Her parents were told three times their daughter was not going to make it so they began to make funeral plans. But the tot pulled through yet again, and now, despite the trauma, Scarlett appears to be just like any other three year old. Miss Leybourne said: ‘Scarlett has been through so much, she has had about 20 operations and about half have been quite major. ‘Before Scarlett got the heart transplant the surgeons told us she was in real trouble. The night before her transplant was horrendous. I was planning her funeral in my head some nights. ‘It’s a massive relief to know our baby girl is home once and for all and is back to being her cheeky little self. ‘Despite the fact she missed out on quite a lot whilst she was in hospital she is just like every other three year old.'","Scarlett Leybourne diagnosed with enlarged heart at six months old .

A heart attack gene has been discovered by scientists. The flawed DNA, found in one in eight men, raises the odds of a patient with heart disease having a heart attack by 38 per cent. It also raises the likelihood of them dying in the next six years by the same amount. A small number of women – 2 to 3 per cent – are also affected by the rogue DNA. In future, it might be possible to test heart disease patients for the gene and give them a treatment that will boost their odds of survival. US researcher Redford Williams said: ‘It is almost too good to be true.’ Dr Williams, of Duke University, in North Carolina, began by showing that people with the genetic flaw produce twice as much of the stress hormone cortisol when put under psychological pressure. As cortisol is known to be bad for the cardiac health, he then tracked thousands of heart disease patients for six years. This revealed that those with the DNA that made them extra-sensitive to stress were also at higher risk of heart attacks, as well as dying from any cause over the course of the study. In those with heart disease, having the gene was as damaging as smoking or being obese. Heart attack genes have been discovered before.  But Dr Williams believes his is different because it is known how it raises the odds of problems. Plus, it should be possible to treat its effects. For instance, if further research confirms the findings, heart disease patients could be given drugs that lower cortisol production, the journal PLoS ONE reports. Hope: The research raises the prospect that heart disease risks could be combated in those with the faulty gene . Lead author Beverly Brummett, said: ‘The exciting part to me is that is genetic trait occurs in a significant proportion of people with heart disease. ‘If we can replicate this and build on it, we might be able to find ways to reduce the cortisol reaction to stress – and reduce deaths from heart attack.’ It is also possible that treating still-healthy carriers of the gene would prevent them from ever suffering a heart attack.","Scientists identified a defective gene in many of those monitored .

A cross country skier who broke his back in an accident on a Colorado slope was saved by his husky who kept him warm before running for help. Leonard Somers was enjoying a back-country skiing trip with his dog, Juneau, last month when he fell and pierced his neck on the frozen roots of a dead tree. Unable to move his arm or legs, and with snow covering him, Mr Somers could have died had it not been for his five-year-old dog. Lucky to be alive: Cross country skier Leonard Somers says his husky Juneau saved his life . Mountain rescue: Leonard Somers with Juneau the husky, who raised the alarm after a ski accident . The husky dug the snow away from his owner's face, and laid on his body to keep him warm for more than 45 minutes, before running to get help when Mr Somers heard a group of skiers passing by. 'Without Juneau here I would probably not be alive today,' Mr Somers told Fox 29. The experienced skier dislocated his vertebra in the accident and has been left in a wheelchair since the accident on November 2. He had been skiing on Colorado's Berthoud Pass with his nephew Ryan Bame, when the pair became separated as it started to get dark. Mr Somers then fell into a ravine, where a frozen tree punctured his vertebrae, leaving him paralyzed. 'I tried to yell for help but when I dislocated my vertebrae, I'd lost my voice quite a bit,' Mr Somers said. Fortunately, his loyal dog refused to leave his side. 'She came up and started helping me dig . the snow away from my face. She was laying on top of me the whole time . kind of looking at me like ""What can I do to help"",' he said.

Danger: Leonard Somers has been left paralyzed after falling during a ski trip to the Berthoud Pass . Eventually he heard another ski party in the distance and sent Juneau to find them. The group of skiers had a dog with them, and Juneau managed to get it to follow her back to Mr Somers, forcing its owners to follow. 'I first saw the dog by himself and then he headed over to where Leonard was,' Jenny Beltman, who was part of the group who found Mr Somers, told KDVR. 'He was very loyal. He never left his side.' Fortunately, one of the people the dog led to Mr Somers was a trauma surgeon, who was able to look after him while mountain rescue were called. Mr Somers doesn't know if he will be able to walk again after the accident, but he does know that without Juneau he may never have been rescued. He also credits five-year-old Juneau with helping him through the recovery process. Rewards: Juneau has been presented with a Heroic Dog Award for her actions . 'When I first woke up, I wasnâ€™t sure if I was happy to be alive or not,' he told CBS Denver. '[Juneau] helps me remain hopeful that Iâ€™ll walk out of here or someday I will walk again.' Animal rights group Peta has recognized Juneau's actions by presenting her with a Heroic Dog Award. 'Dogs are more than our best friends. As Juneau demonstrated, they're our family members and our protectors,' PETA's senior vice president Daphna Nachminovitch said.","Five-year-old dog laid on Leonard Somers to keep him warm after accident .

Emma Foster describes the moment her daughter Lauren was diagnosed with cancer as like stepping on to a rollercoaster. But now, two years on, the 12-year-old is free of the disease – thanks to a new type of highly targeted radiotherapy at the cutting edge of cancer technology. Proton-beam therapy is already paid for by the NHS for certain rare cancers, but patients have to travel to the US for treatment. Now it is set to come to Britain, after a Government pledge of £250 million this summer to build two proton therapy centres, due to open in 2018. Success story: Lauren Foster, 12, is now in remission from tissue cancer thanks to a new type of highly targeted radiotherapy . The pioneering technology kills cancer cells in a similar way to conventional radiotherapy but uses proton beams instead of X-rays. Protons are tiny positively charged particles found in the centre of atoms that are generated and focused into beams in large particle-accelerators called cyclotrons. But unlike X-rays, proton beams release their energy only when they reach their target – meaning much less damage to surrounding healthy tissue. That reduces the long-term side effects of treatment, which is particularly important for children. Lauren, who had a rare tissue cancer called Rhabdomyosarcoma, was an ideal candidate. Her cancer affects about 60 children in the UK each year and develops from muscle or fibrous tissue in any part of the body. Lauren’s tumour was at the back of her . palate, meaning surgery wasn’t a viable option. Its proximity to her . eyes and nose made the pinpoint accuracy of proton-beam therapy . extremely beneficial. ‘I’d never heard of proton-beam therapy before,’ says Emma, a medical secretary. Happy Family: Lauren and her mother Emma . ‘When the doctor told us it was . available only in America, I immediately thought of the cost and how we . could afford it, but the doctor said that if the panel decided it was . the best option for Lauren, the NHS would pay for it.’ The . panel agreed, and in March 2012 Lauren travelled to the US with her . parents Emma and Stephen  and younger sister Holly. Lauren had 28 . sessions over a nine-week period, which fell halfway through her six . months of chemotherapy. Proton therapy is done in tandem with chemotherapy and its timing in the cycle is crucial. The . treatment is ‘posh radiotherapy’, according to Dr Adrian Crellin, the . UK’s clinical lead on proton- beam therapy. ‘It’s unlikely that it is . going to cure any more children with cancer but it reduces the chances . of long-term side effects and secondary cancers in later life. But in . adults with some rare cancers like sarcomas of the skull and spine, . proton therapy can mean an increased dose of treatment can be directed . at the tumour, potentially curing more patients.’ Each . treatment room costs about £20 million, more than ten times the cost of . the linear accelerators used in conventional radiotherapy. The . NHS has been sending patients to two centres in the US – in Oklahoma . and Florida – since 2008, at a cost of £97,500 per patient. Once the . machines begin operating in this country, these costs should drop to . about £40,000 per patient. ‘It is an expensive treatment but at the moment a significant proportion of the cost is travel, accommodation and chemotherapy in America,’ says Dr Crellin, whose team have reviewed 504 potential patients since it became available on the NHS in 2008. Of those, 383 have been approved,  70 per cent of them children. Lauren’s treatment began with surgeons inserting tiny beads, known as fiducial markers, into the surface of her skull. These show up on the scan and enable the radiographer to target the proton beams precisely at the site of the tumour.  A custom-made mask was fitted over Lauren’s face to keep her head in place for each 40-minute session. ‘I was worried about how Lauren would cope and if she’d be able to stay still for so long,’ says Emma. ‘We thought she might need to have each session under general anaesthetic [as some youngsters do], but she did brilliantly.’ Lauren recalls: ‘It was a bit scary at first but I got used to it. By the end I sometimes felt so ill I couldn’t even be bothered to feel emotions.’ Importing treatment: The UK government has pledged £250million to build two centres to treat cancer with proton therapy . A side effect is that the beams burn the area targeted. Lauren’s throat became so sore after two weeks that she had to be fed through a tube for the final five weeks. ‘She was very weak,’ says Emma. ‘Those last weeks were the worst of my life. It was awful. We were so isolated and at the weekends when Lauren had a break from treatment, we would just sit in the hotel room counting down the hours. Lauren would sleep or just sit there.’ The new UK centres – one at Manchester’s Christie Hospital and the other at UCL Hospital, London – will mean patients can be treated closer to home. And the number treated is expected to rise from 79 NHS referrals last year to 1,500 annually. Some medics are sceptical about how many people will be eligible  for the technology, and last month’s report making the case for the Christie said there are ‘considerable risks in ensuring patient numbers’. But Dr Crellin says this is because proton-beam therapy is still in its early stages. ‘It’s for very specific rare cancers and we’ve got to be careful about raising false hope, but if you’re that patient it could make a huge difference to your prognosis.’ Proton-beam therapy is by no means a miracle cure as only one per cent of patients currently receiving radiotherapy are suitable. And it’s too early to say whether the children treated develop fewer long-term side effects. But for Lauren’s family, the verdict is a positive one. Last summer, scans revealed that her tumour had disappeared. Lauren still has scans every six weeks but started secondary school in September and is thriving. ‘We feel privileged to have had the best treatment money can buy,’ says Emma. Lauren Foster was nominated  for a Cancer Research UK Little Star Award in partnership with TK Maxx. The awards celebrate the courage of all children diagnosed with cancer.

Gone: Dr Gordon Coutts, who is on sick leave, will not return to Colchester Hospital University NHS Trust by 'mutual agreement' The chief executive of a scandal-hit hospital under investigation over the manipulation of cancer waiting times has resigned. Dr Gordon Coutts, who is on sick leave, will not return to Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust by ‘mutual agreement’. It comes after the Mail revealed he was personally alerted to allegations about the manipulation of data as early as 2011, but failed to act. Police are investigating claims that staff were ‘pressured or bullied’ by  managers to alter cancer waiting times in order to meet national targets, potentially putting lives at risk. The £165,000-a-year boss has been accused of having a ‘fixation’ with government targets. His personal assistant, Mandy Tapfield, quit in October after 28 years at the hospital. Her husband Paul claimed Dr Coutts had bullied her and ‘made her life hell’. Yesterday a trust spokesman said Dr Coutts would not get any payoff. He would be leaving immediately – rather than serving his six-month notice period – and would not be receiving further salary payments. But he will now be eligible for a £10,000-a-year pension and a pension lump sum of up to £5,000, despite only serving as chief executive for three years. Dr Coutts said in a statement: ‘I regret that there have been problems in the trust’s cancer services. As chief executive I always took my responsibility for what happened in the organisation very seriously. ‘I am sorry that some of our patients were let down and that what has happened may have damaged local people’s confidence in their hospitals.’ Cover-up: Police are investigating claims that staff at the hospital were 'pressured or bullied' by managers to alter cancer waiting times in order to meet national targets, potentially putting lives at risk .

A 12-year-old boy who received a kidney from a stranger has met the man who transformed his life. Tom Higgs is the first person at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London to receive a kidney from an altruistic living donor. Most living donors are family members but, on occasion, strangers will offer up their kidneys to help save other people’s lives. Tom Higgs, 12, received a new kidney from Roger Sutton after he suffered kidney failure caused by a rare kidney disease. The pair have just met for the first time since the operation which was carried out in 2011 . Tom met his donor, Roger Sutton, a 53-year-old GP from Portsmouth, after the pair exchanged letters through their transplant co-ordinators. Tom has suffered from a rare type of kidney disease, atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), since the age of five. It causes blood clots to develop in the blood vessels of the kidneys and, eventually, kidney failure. The schoolboy, from Ruislip in Greater London, needed dialysis every night for five years. He was put on the waiting list for a donor when he was eight. A new kidney from a family member was not possible and Tom knew that a kidney from an altruistic living donor was his best option. Tom’s mother Vicky said: ‘Those years on dialysis were very stressful and restrictive on our lives. ‘We knew that he was really poorly and would eventually need a transplant. I had to set up the dialysis machine and get Tom on it by 7pm each evening so he would be off it in time to get ready for school the next morning. Tom (pictured in hospital) had to have dialysis every night for five years before the transplant. None of his relatives were able to give him a new kidney so he was dependent on a donation from a stranger . Selfless: Mr Sutton says he decided to donate a kidney as a way of saying thank you for all of the 'great things' that have happened in his life . ‘I needed to change his dressings before attaching him to the machine and also had to give him weekly injections. ‘It was heart-breaking knowing how much Tom disliked all of this, but we had no choice as his kidneys weren’t working and we had to filter his blood.’ Donors and recipients normally remain anonymous but Tom and Mr Sutton decided to waive that right to highlight the benefits of organ donation. Tom underwent the surgery in 2011 and met Mr Sutton this year. His mother said: ‘Our lives have changed so much, it’s hard to believe. Tom (pictured in hospital) was the first person at Great Ormond Street Hospital to receive a kidney from an altruistic living donor . Mr Sutton (pictured with his wife, Debbie) said: 'I can't pinpoint the exact moment when the idea to donate a kidney first came to me. I suppose what started out as a thought grew into a quiet conviction that it was the right thing to do' ‘Before the transplant, we had to wait for Tom to come off the machine so we could get together and open our presents around the Christmas tree. ‘On his birthdays, we usually brought his presents up to his room. Christmas is so different now, and Tom is definitely looking forward to the celebrations this year. ‘When we heard about the match, we were told the organ was from a living donor who had decided to donate a kidney to a stranger. We were really surprised that someone would be so selfless.’ Mr Sutton underwent the operation at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth during a planned sabbatical from his GP work. He said: ‘I can’t pinpoint the exact moment when the idea to donate a kidney first came to me. I suppose what started out as a thought grew into a quiet conviction that it was the right thing to do - a chance to say thank you for all the great things that have happened in my life. Tom (pictured in hospital) suffered from a rare type of kidney disease, atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which causes blood clots to develop in the blood vessels of the kidneys and, eventually, kidney failure . Tom's mother Vicky said: 'Those years on dialysis were very stressful and restrictive on our lives. We knew that he was really poorly and would eventually need a transplant' ‘Looking back, I can see there’s been a bit of a “renal thread” running through my life. ‘My grandmother lived for 35 years after having one of her kidneys removed. I watched a kidney transplant operation when I was a medical student. Twenty years ago a friend of mine had a transplant after developing renal failure. ‘My wife Debbie, who is a dietician, was for many years part of a renal dietetics team. As a GP, I have seen just how important organ donation is and how many lives have been saved through transplants.’ Mr Sutton underwent a rigorous assessment before the operation, both mentally and physically. He was also tested to ensure his remaining kidney would function well. Dr Stephen Marks, a consultant kidney specialist who leads the kidney transplant programme at Great Ormond Street, said: ‘We are delighted with Tom’s progress since his transplant. Each year up to 36 of our patients undergo kidney transplants but Tom was the first one in our hospital to receive a kidney from a healthy member of the public who was also a complete stranger. Donors and recipients normally remain anonymous but Tom and Mr Sutton decided to waive that right to highlight the benefits of organ donation . ‘The numbers of children, young people and adults on the transplant waiting list far outweigh the number of organs that are available for transplant. ‘It can sometimes be difficult to find a suitable donor among living relatives and there simply are not enough people on the organ donor register willing to donate after their deaths. ‘Altruistic non-directed kidney donation from individuals who are prepared to selflessly undergo a major operation opens up another vital source of organs.’ Mr Sutton’s consultant surgeon, Sam Dutta, said: ‘The number of altruistic kidney donations has been on the increase here in Portsmouth over the last few years. Dr Stephen Marks, at Great Ormond Street, said: 'We are delighted with Tom's progress since his transplant. Each year up to 36 of our patients undergo kidney transplants but Tom was the first one in our hospital to receive a kidney from a healthy member of the public who was also a complete stranger' ‘Since the start of this type of donation in 2007, we have seen 31 altruistic donations. This is one of the most selfless acts a person can do and we know that a healthy person can live a perfectly normal life with one good kidney. ‘In 2012, Portsmouth contributed the largest number of altruistic kidneys in the country.’ Figures released in May showed that the number of living people giving one of their organs to a stranger almost tripled in one year in the UK. The Human Tissue Authority approved 104 altruistic organ donations in 2012-13 compared with 38 the previous year. Atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome is a rare condition that causes blood clots to form in the small blood vessels of the kidneys. They can restrict, or block, the blood flow to the kidneys and cause kidney failure. The condition can cause anaemia which results in pale skin, jaundice, fatigue and shortness of breath. Sufferers can also experience easy bruising, abnormal bleeding and end-stage renal disease. The condition is estimated to occur in one in every 500,000 people each year. About 20 per cent of sufferers have a family history of the condition.

Archbishop Vincent Nichols: 'We must not forget our Middle Eastern brothers and sisters' The most senior Catholic in England and Wales has told followers to pray for Christians in the Middle East, where even going to church is 'an act of life-risking bravery'. The Archbishop of Westminster warned of the dangers to Christians in Egypt, Iraq and Syria, all dogged by religious violence. The Most Rev Vincent Nichols added Christianity 'was literally born in the Middle East' as he delivered Midnight Mass to worshippers in London's Westminster Cathedral. The homily echoes comments by Prince Charles last week as he visited Coptic and Syrian Orthodox communities now living in London and Hertfordshire. Coptic Christians in Egypt make up a tenth of the population but have faced sectarian violence since the ousting of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi in July. About a tenth of Syrians are Christian, too - but with the country in the thick of a brutal civil war, minorities feel increasingly threatened. The Archbishop said: 'Christians are the most widely . persecuted religious group in the world today and this evening we think . especially of the Middle East, especially of Egypt, Iraq and Syria. 'As . Prince Charles said last week: ""Christianity was literally born in the . Middle East and we must not forget our Middle Eastern brothers and . sisters."" 'We come to this . Cathedral this evening freely and relatively easily, ready to give a . simple act of witness to our faith. 'But for many going to church is an . act of life-risking bravery. We thank them and seek to be inspired by . their courageous faith.' The Prince of Wales hit out last week at the way Christians were targeted by fanatics in the Middle East. He claimed bridges between Christianity and Islam were being 'deliberately destroyed' by people with vested interests. 'For 20 years I have tried to build bridges between Islam and Christianity to dispel ignorance and misunderstanding,' he told a reception for Middle East Christians at Clarence House, London. Christmas: The message came during Midnight Mass at London's Westminster Cathedral, pictured . The Archbishop of Westminster (right) warned of the dangers to Christians in Egypt, Iraq and Syria . â€˜The point though surely is that we have now reached a crisis where bridges are rapidly being deliberately destroyed by those with a vested interest in doing so. â€˜This is achieved through intimidation, false accusation and organised persecution including to the Christian communities in the Middle East.â€™ . Archbishop Nicols also echoed Pope Francis in reflecting upon hope and tenderness. He said at 'this pivotal moment we know how much healing we need'. He added: 'We know how much we need to repair and strengthen the bond of our universal brotherhood, our common humanity so that everywhere and always we see each other as a brother and a sister, children of a common Father who loves each one as much as every other and asks us to do likewise.' He told followers to have hope, adding: 'This is so important as of ourselves we can easily lose heart. But God always open doors for us, he never closes them. Building bridges: The message echoed Prince Charles, who spoke to Middle Eastern Christians last week . The Prince of Wales said: 'For 20 years I have tried to build bridges between Islam and Christianity to dispel ignorance... Bridges are [now] rapidly being deliberately destroyed by those with a vested interest in doing so . 'He opens the doors of compassion, mercy and forgiveness that we can lift up our heads again and go forward in hope of his unswerving love. 'He says: ""do not be afraid of tenderness"". In the helpless of the babe we see God so close to us, in such precarious circumstances, asking us not only to trust ourselves to him but also to express ourselves to him with all the gentleness and tenderness that is in our hearts. 'This is the Lord of love who invites us into a relationship of love. And in all our loving, we show our own vulnerability and joy in the tenderness we have for each other. So too it is with the Lord, as this night makes so clear.' Up to 1,500 Roman Catholics were expected to attend the service in the Edwardian-era cathedral, which serves as the principal church for the estimated 5.8 million Catholics in England and Wales. Archbishop Nichols was appointed in 2009 after nine years as the Archbishop of Birmingham and is the president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales. He came to the role pledging to tackle thorny issues plaguing the church, like historic child abuse, head-on. In 2010 he said shame was 'not enough', adding: 'The abuse of children is a grievous sin against God.'","Vincent Nichols warned of dangerous clashes in Egypt, Iraq and Syria .

No diamonds have been found yet, but if they are, they might look a little like this diamond crystal, found in South Africa, which is pictured on kimberlite . ‘It would be very surprising if there weren't diamonds in these kimberlites,’ Greg Yaxley of the Australian National University in Canberra, who led the research, said. Kimberlite is a rare rock where diamonds are often found, which is named after the South African town of Kimberley - the site of a late 19th-century diamond rush. However, this does not mean that people will flocking to Antarctica to mine diamonds any time soon as it is not only forbiddingly cold and remote but also protected by a treaty that preserves the continent for scientific research and wildlife, from penguins to seals. The 1991 environmental accord has banned mining for at least 50 years. ‘I don't think it's terribly practical that anyone could actually explore successfully and, personally, I hope that mining does not take place,’ Dr Yaxley said. Others geologists doubted the find held much commercial value. The team of researchers found kimberlite deposits around Mount Meredith, in the Prince Charles Mountains in East Antarctica. Another smaller mountain is pictured . Dr Robert Larter, a British Antarctic Survey geophysicist, said: ‘It is important to note that the study does not report discovery of a commercially-viable deposit or even actual diamonds. What it reports is the discovery of rocks of the type that often host diamonds.’ Less than 10 per cent of the deposits of similar kimberlite are economically viable, said Teal Riley of the British Antarctic Survey. ‘It's a big leap from here to mining,’ he told Reuters. The Antarctic Treaty is binding only on its 50 signatories, but it has the backing of major powers, including the United States and China. Many expect the ban on mining to be extended in 2041. ‘There is likely to be little opposition to an extension of this prohibition, despite the potential discovery of a new type of Antarctic ""ice""’ Nature Communications, the journal which published the study, said in a statement. But another expert said the future is not so clear. The team of researchers found kimberlite deposits around Mount Meredith, in the Prince Charles Mountains, East Antarctica. The region is forbiddingly cold and remote but is also protected by a treaty that preserves the continent for scientific research and wildlife, from penguins to seals . Gold, platinum, copper, iron and coal have also been found in Antarctica and diamonds are already mined today in some of the world's colder reaches of northern Canada and Siberia. Kevin Hughes, of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, said: ‘We do not know what the Treaty parties' views will be on mining after 2041 or what technologies might exist that could make extraction of Antarctic minerals economically viable.’ Dr Riley said there was a fine line between geological mapping and prospecting with an eye to mining. Russia, the Ukraine and China, among other countries, have been more active in surveying Antarctica in recent years. Demand for diamonds is likely to outpace supply in coming years as few new mines are being discovered to provide the newly wealthy in countries such as China with Western-style jewellery. Demand for diamonds is likely to outpace supply in coming years as few new mines are being discovered to provide the newly wealthy in countries such as China with Western-style jewellery. A huge oval diamond estimated to be worth $28-35million is pictured . The last major find was Rio Tinto's Murowa mine in Zimbabwe in 1997. Diamonds are formed under immense heat and pressure around 100 miles (160 km) below the earth’s surface in the molten rock of its mantle. Millions of years later, they are brought to the surface in powerful eruptions and preserved in the distinctive igneous rock formations called kimberlites. The kimberlite deposit is also confirmation of how continents drift. The region of East Antarctica was once part of a continent known as Gondwanaland, connected to what is now Africa and India, which also have kimberlite. People will flocking to Antarctica to mine diamonds any time soon as the continent is protected by a treaty that preserves it for scientific research and wildlife.

Being HIV positive is no longer the death sentence it once was, as life expectancy of those receiving treatment is approaching that of the general population. Researchers found a 20-year-old HIV-positive adult on antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be expected to live into their early 70s - a life expectancy approaching that of the general U.S. population. However, life expectancy is lower for people with a history of injecting drugs as well as those who are not white. Cell with HIV:  Nearly nine million adults worldwide living with HIV receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) which keeps the virus from multiplying by killing the virus in the bloodstream. Researchers found a 20-year-old HIV-positive adult on ART may be expected to live into their early 70's . The life expectancies of nearly 23,000 individuals on ART - which consists of the combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs to best suppress the HIV virus and stop the progression of HIV disease - were calculated based on mortality rates in the early to mid-2000s. Participants in the study, by the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design and the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, were aged 20 years or older. Changes in life expectancy from 2000 to 2007 among HIV-positive individuals were evaluated by selected sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, such as drug use history and immune cell counts. The study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE, found that life expectancy at age 20 increased from 36.1 to 51.4 years from 2000-2002 to 2006-2007. The results of the study indicate increasing longevity for individuals living with HIV in the U.S. and Canada. Here, a large red ribbon hangs at the North Portico of the White House, for World AIDS Day . Men and women had comparable life expectancies in all periods except the last 2006 to 2007 period. Life expectancy was lower for individuals with a history of injection drug use, those who were non-white, and those who initiated ART with low CD4 count - a count of cells that activate the immune response - compared to those who started at a higher count. The results of this study suggest increasing longevity for individuals living with HIV in the U.S. and Canada and contribute to the growing evidence that HIV-positive people on ART have life expectancies approaching those in general populations. For years, doctors have been treating HIV patients using anti-viral drugs, the effects of which can sometimes be mixed. But a group of scientists in New York have tried seeing if using powerful doses of radiation - a radioactive smart bomb - might be more effective, and the results are very encouraging. Researchers announced last week that in patients who were blasted with a combination of antiviral drugs and radiation, the treatment was even more effective and made the HIV virus became undetectable in the body. Dr. Ekaterina Dadachova, from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, is behind this pioneering research, which investigated the ability of radioimmunotherapy to kill white blood cells infected with HIV. The radioactive antibodies were also able to kill significantly more HIV-infected cells in the brain while doing less damage to the brain's delicate systems.","U.S. researchers found a 20-year-old HIV-positive adult on antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be expected to live into their early 70's .

'Based on this philosophy, we've got a new setting that lets you quickly and easily capture the moments you care about with a simple wink of the eye.’ The firm added that the feature is not turned on by default and instead wearers need to enable it in the Settings menu.

Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'Google Glass already faces a minefield of privacy issues and this aspect is just another reminder of how it will potentially undermine our ability to control what information is held about us and by who. 'The absence of any substantial audible or visual instruction makes it much harder for people to understand their image is being captured and exercise their right to object, while doing nothing to address the reasonable questions about how legal requirements for people to consent to data being captured will be met. 'Early camera phones needed a shutter sound to alert people to the fact the camera was being used after a series of incidents that intruded on people’s privacy. Google Glass has yet to reassure people in the same way that it will not be a snoopers favourite gadget.'

Forget pairing the right wine with the right meal - what you should be doing is pairing your tipple to the TV show you’re watching. This is according to latest research that suggests tuning into a certain programme this Christmas can change the way a festive drink tastes. According to the study, Cabernet Sauvignon should be paired with Downton Abbey while Chardonnay tastes better with the Eastenders Christmas special. Latest research suggests tuning into  certain TV programmes this Christmas can change and enhance the way a festive drink tastes . The study, carried out by Mindlab on behalf of Aldi, asked 50 people to rate wines, beer and brandy while watching four classic Christmas TV shows. Unbeknown to the participants, the drinks served remained constant however the flavours and characteristics detected by the group changed considerably depending on which programme they were watching. Downton Abbey seemed to produce the strongest response, with people rating the drinks as more elegant and refined when watching the popular period drama. They were also significantly more likely to pick out traditional English flavours which would have been popular in Edwardian times when the series is set. Of all of the programmes shown, Downton Abbey elicited the strongest response, with respondents rating the drinks as more elegant and refined when watching the popular period drama . These included vanilla, mint and cherry in the red wine; grassy, floral flavours in the beer; and rose, wood and oak in the brandy. Researchers suggest that based on these flavour preferences, an elegant Cabernet Sauvignon with notes of dark fruit, vanilla and mint would be the perfect red wine pairing when catching up on the latest escapades of the Crawley family. When watching Only Fools and Horses, 16 per cent of respondents were more likely to rate drinks as fun, 22 per cent as more refreshing and 11 per cent as more enjoyable. They were also more likely to pick out sweet and fruity flavours, some similar to those found in DelBoy’s beloved Pina Coladas. When watching Only Fools and Horses, 16 per cent of respondents were more likely to rate drinks as fun, 22 per cent as more refreshing and 11 per cent as more enjoyable . Flavours included cherry in the red wine, fruit in the beer, and apricot, apple and citrus in the white wine. When tuning into Strictly Come Dancing the drinks were more likely to be rated as fun, refreshing and elegant reflecting the nature of the show and costumes. Meanwhile people watching EastEnders rated the drinks as more refreshing and lively but overall less refined. They were also more likely to pick out sharp notes, such as bitter in the beer and cherry in the red wine perhaps reflecting the show’s tumultuous story lines. With EastEnders, respondents rated the drinks as more refreshing and lively but overall less refined. They were also more likely to pick out sharp notes, such as bitter in the beer and cherry in the red wine perhaps reflecting the show's tumultuous story lines . ‘We all know that tasting is a multisensory experience, with sight and smell almost as important as taste but this study shows that the effects of sight and sound expand way beyond the glass,’ said Duncan Smith, of Mindlab. ‘What we are seeing here is cognitive priming theory where the stimulus, in this case the TV programme, sets up our brains and in turn our taste buds to respond in a certain way.’ Traditionally, scientists have thought the tongue, nose, and brain changehow people experience the flavours of food and drink. When watching Only Fools and Horses, respondents were more likely to pick out sweet and fruity flavours, some similar to those found in DelBoy's beloved Pina Coladas . More recently, studies have found that what you see can be just as important.  And it's not just the programmes you watch that can affect the taste of your drink. According to Professor Charles Spence, the room you’re in has a much larger impact on your taste buds than you might think. His latest study undertaken in October found that different environments can affect the sensory experience of whisky by as much as 20 per cent. The room you're in has a much larger impact on your taste buds than you might think. The grassy room featured a green light, real grass, plants, the sounds of lawnmowers and sheep and the smell of the countryside . In what Professor Spence described as the world’s first science experiment to look at how the surroundings can impact flavour perceptions, three hundred whisky drinkers were let loose in a bar. The specially designed Singleton Sensorium in London’s Soho saw people tasting exactly the same single malt whisky in three rooms that had very different environments. They then had to rate the different flavours they were able to taste in each room. The first was a grassy room which featured a green light, real grass, plants, the sounds of lawnmowers and sheep and the smell of the countryside. The second was a fruity room with red, round fruits and chiming bells hung on the ceiling. A final aftertaste room had wood panels and sounds of crackling wood fires. ‘The ratings of the grassiness in the grassy room were about 15 to 20 per cent higher than in the sweet or aftertaste room,’ said Professor Spence . ‘Similarly the sweetness of the whisky in the red room was about 10 per cent higher than in either of the other rooms. ‘You can almost think about using the rooms to season, and bring out the flavours, in the drinks.’","When watching Strictly Come Dancing, drinks were more often rated as fun .

The value of Bitcoins has plummeted by half following Chinese restrictions on exchanges in the virtual currency. BTC China, a Bitcoin and Yuan trading platform, announced that local payment companies have been blocked from providing it with clearing services. This means that the firm can no longer accept yuan-based deposits. The value of Bitcoins has plummeted following Chinese restrictions on exchanges in the virtual currency. One Bitcoin was trading for as low as 2,560 yuan (£258), according to the South China Morning Post. At its peak in late November a Bitcoin sold for 7,588 yuan (£764). The measures reflect growing concern . by authorities that the cybercurrency, which is created, distributed and . authenticated independently of any bank or government, could pose a . viable alternative to China's tightly controlled yuan, which is not . freely convertible. The relative anonymity of Bitcoins holds out the promise of being able to spend money across the internet without scrutiny. The value of Bitcoins also plunged . earlier this month after the Chinese government questioned the legal . status of the virtual currency. A . joint statement from several Chinese official bodies such as the . People's Bank of China said Bitcoins are not a currency and cannot be . used as a form of payment by any businesses or financial institutions. Virtual currency exchanges in China are not overseen by the country's central bank, so they are reliant on independent clearing houses to act as go-betweens. 'We essentially got notice from our third-party provider today that they will discontinue accepting payments for us and new deposits,' Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTC China, told the South China Morning Post. A statement from the exchange added that account holders can still top up their accounts using Bitcoins and withdraw yuan, but has had to 'temporarily stop its yuan account recharging functions'. 'BTC China will continue to operate. Please continue to monitor our website, we will try to offer another way to recharge,"" it said. Despite wild swings in value, the cybercurrency has been moving toward broader acceptance, with a growing number of companies accepting Bitcoins, which can be converted into cash. 'A lot of people put Bitcoin's rise over recent months to China where interest in it has gone through the roof,' Emily Spaven, editor of digital currency news site CoinDesk told the BBC. 'People are getting frightened that with . the new regulations the country could now drop out of the ecosystem. Going forward, it's certainly not the end of Bitcoin, but people have . been panic selling.' BTC China, a Bitcoin and Yuan trading platform, announced that  that local payment companies have been blocked from providing it with clearing services . Today it was also reported that European banking watchdogs have warned British savers they are at risk of losing their money if they put their cash in unofficial digital currencies such as Bitcoins. The European Banking Authority advised savers to be careful before joining in the Bitcoin bonanza, saying buyers risk having their money raided from laptops by hackers and that the value of these currencies can be subject to wild swings. In addition, buyers have no protection if the currency collapses or an online business that promises to store their currency fails. Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. Yesterday the Norwegian government announced that is does not count as real money. 'Bitcoins don’t fall under the usual definition of money or currency,' Hans Christian Holte, director general of taxation in Norway, said. Instead, Norway will classify Bitcoins as an asset, subject to capital gains tax. 'We’ve done some assessments on what’s the right and sound way to handle this in the tax system,' he added. The virtual currency has left governments throughout the world scratching their heads as it is not controlled by a government or any central bank.","Virtual currency's value tumbles after Chinese clampdown .

Tasered: Kenneth Chamberlain, pictured in his days as a Marine, was allegedly unarmed when he was shot by police . A chronically ill African-American heart patient died after police officers - called to deal with a medical emergency - burst into his home and Tasered him twice in the chest, it has been claimed. Former Marine Kenneth Chamberlain Sr was allegedly shot by stun and beanbag guns at his White Plains, New York City, apartment in the early hours of November 19. The victim, who had also worked as a correction officer, died in hospital later that day. At first officers said the shooting was 'justified' as self-defence because the 'deranged' victim had first attacked officers with a hatchet and knife. But, four months later, a grand jury is now being convened to look into alleged inconsistencies in the record of the involved officers' version of events. This is because fresh evidence, in the form of a recording from medical alert company LifeAid purporting to reveal everything said inside the apartment, has come to light. Two videos which capture some of the incident, from a building security camera and also attached to a stun gun used by the police, have also emerged. Lawyers for Chamberlain's son, Kenneth Jr, say police were called to the sleeping 68-year-old's housing project home in the early hours of the morning.

Almost 200,000 people have signed an online petition demanding justice in the case. Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore confirmed a grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the case this month. The outrage follows the shooting of black teen Trayvon Martin, 17, who was gunned down by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 28, in February. Zimmerman claims he acted in self-defence after being sucker-punched by the teen in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. The fact Zimmerman was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations. Tens of thousands of protesters have marched at rallies across the U.S. Confusion now surrounds exactly what happened - with details emerging of the gunman's criminal past, and Trayvon's history of truancy, drugs and graffiti.","Kenneth Chamberlain Sr, 68, allegedly shot by stun and beanbag guns .

Archaeologists have discovered remains suggesting that cats have lived with humans far longer than was previously thought. Cats were believed to have been domesticated 4,000 years ago in Egypt but bodies found at a dig at a village in Shaanxi province in central China date back 5,300 years. Dr Fiona Marshall, of Washington University in St Louis said analysis including radiocarbon dating of bones suggested the cats preyed on rodents that lived on farmed millet. Chinese farmers may have domesticated cats more than 5,000 years ago to protect their grain. Pictured, a Near Eastern Wildcat, native to Western Asia and Africa . The team analysed eight bones from at least two cats excavated from the site. One of the cats had old bones - suggesting it had survived well into old age in the village. Another was shown to have eaten fewer animals and more millet than . expected, suggesting it had been fed by the villagers. Cat remains found at a dig at a village in Shaanxi province in central China date back 5,300 years . Dr Marshall, who studied the site with scientists from Chinese universities,  suggested . that the cats were domesticated to control the villagers’ rat problem. The archeologists also found an ancient grain pit, . with thick walls that rodents had managed to dig through, demonstrating . the scale of the infestation. ‘Our data suggests that cats were attracted . to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were . living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored,' she said. ‘Results . of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food . for the cats 5,300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and . cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. ‘Even . if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence  confirms that . they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had . mutual benefits.’ DNA . studies suggest that most of the estimated 600million domestic cats . around the world today are descendants of the near eastern wildcat, . which still lives in northern Africa and the Middle East. The discovery has left archaeologists . puzzling over whether the Chinese cats had been imported from the Middle . East, or whether they were a completely different breed. Speaking . of the latest find, Dr  Marshall said: ‘We do not yet know whether . these cats came to China from the Near East, whether they interbred with . Chinese wild cat  species, or even whether cats from China played a . previously unsuspected role in domestication.’ Cats have lived alongside humans for a very long time, but when and where they were tamed remains a mystery. Previous evidence suggested they were first domesticated in ancient Egypt, where they were kept some 4,000 years ago. More recent findings point to a much earlier association with humans, including the discovery of a wild cat buried with a human nearly 10,000 years ago in Cyprus. Most of the estimated 600 million domestic cats now living around the world are known to be descended most directly from the Near Eastern Wildcat, one of five wildcat sub-species still found in the Old World. One of the cats was found to have a diet featuring food provided by - or scavenged - from humans . The remains were found in the Shaanxi province of China (file picture). Analysis of bones from at least two cats uncovered at the site showed that they preyed on grain-eating animals, probably rodents .","Cat remains discovered in Shaanxi hint cats helped farmers protect crops .

After the terrifying incident, which was captured on a camera installed on the car's dashboard, Chornovol could not call the police because she could barely talk. Later in the day, police say they identified three suspects and took two of them into custody over the crime. It is the latest in a string of attacks against journalists and civic activists who have condemened the government. According to police, Chornovol was driving home to the village of Gora when around 1:30 a.m. her car was blocked by a sport utility car with unknown men inside.

A massive flood that carved canyons in Idaho 46,000 years ago could explain similar gorges on Mars. Researchers claim the resemblance between ‘amphitheatre’ canyons in this region and those on Mars reveal important clues about the red planet’s watery past. U-shaped amphitheatre canyons, such as those in Idaho’s Malad Gorge State Park, are relatively rare on Earth but common on the Martian surface. A massive flood that carved canyons, such as Box Canyon in Idaho (pictured), 46,000 years ago could explain similar gorges on Mars . A number of explanations for how these canyons formed have been offered with the most common being a slow and steady process of erosion from upwelling springs. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, California Institute of Technology professor, Michael Lamb, argues the canyons were created by an enormous flood rather than gradual erosion. He has calculated that the brief flood was at least nine metres (30 feet) deep, flowing at a rate of around 1.25 million litres per second. Two canyons in Malad Gorge, Woody's Cove and Stubby Canyon, are characterised by tall vertical headwalls, roughly 150 feet high that curve around to form an amphitheatre . U-shaped canyons, such as those in Idaho's Malad Gorge State Park, are relatively rare on Earth but common on the Martian surface (pictured) The latest study builds on a body of research that has provided a clearer image of Mars' watery history. Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived on Mars in 1971. Mariner 9 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking . orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on . Mars by showing how floods of water broke through dams, carved deep . valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of . kilometers. Mars is currently in the middle of . an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present . time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the . past. In June this year, Curiosity rover found Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. Two canyons in Malad Gorge, Woody's Cove and Stubby Canyon, are characterised by tall vertical headwalls, roughly 150 feet high that curve around to form an amphitheatre. To understand how they formed, the researchers conducted field surveys and collected rock samples from Woody's Cove, Stubby Canyon, and a third canyon in Malad Gorge, known as Pointed Canyon. ‘These blocks are too big to move by spring flow, and there's not enough time for the groundwater to have dissolved them away,’ Professor Lamb said ‘which means that large floods are needed to move them out. ‘To make a canyon, you have to erode the canyon headwall, and you also have to evacuate the material that collapses in.' Surprisingly, the researchers discovered the amphitheatre-headed canyons of Malad Gorge formed at the same time as the amphitheatre-headed Box Canyon, about 18 km (11 miles) to the south 46,000 years ago. A brief, powerful flood could have created these amphitheatre-headed canyons by exploiting fractures in the rock causing rapid erosion. These insights into ancient megafloods on Earth could reveal clues about what may have occurred on the surface of Mars millions of years ago . The amphitheatre-headed canyons originated around the same time as the volcanic eruption that led to the creation of the nearby McKinney Butte Basalt. This suggests the megaflood that carved them was caused by lava flows diverting an ancient river. These insights into ancient megafloods on Earth could reveal clues about what may have occurred on the surface of Mars millions of years ago. The researchers are now developing models simulating canyon formation by megafloods. ‘We intend to test the model against our data at Malad Gorge and to apply it to specific examples on Mars,’ Professor Lamb told Live Science. ‘Using Earth as our guide, the early history of Mars surface environments, including the amounts and duration of flowing surface water, is waiting to be discovered through careful analysis of the landforms and sedimentary deposits on the red planet.’","Scientists predict a flood 9 metres deep occurred in Idaho 46,000 years ago .

A Christmas miracle took place at an animal shelter when a puppy declared stillborn sprang to life 45 minutes later. Vets at the Aurora Animal Shelter in Colorado were astonished by the event, which was described as ‘impossible’. The heartwarming story begins on Christmas Eve, when a small dog in labor was brought to the front desk. Christmas miracle: Aurora Animal Shelter staff hold the newborn puppy and its mother . Veterinarian Dr Nicole Bartley wrote on the shelter’s Facebook page: ‘A quick exam showed that the puppy she was trying to have was far too large to fit. She needed an emergency C-section and she needed it NOW. It was obvious the puppy had been stuck for a long time. ‘There was a lot of infection and very little chance for the puppy. However, we always try to save puppies and kittens born by C-section and the veterinary technicians went to work, but the puppy never breathed, never moved.’ What happened next left the staff at the shelter in a state of disbelief. Remarkable: The puppy didn't respond to vets at first, but eventually sprang to life . The puppy was assumed to be dead and the technicians worked to clear the mother of infection, then they heard a startling sound. Dr Bartley explained that as they stirred the mother from anesthesia 45 minutes later a crying noise began emanating from the blanket the puppy was wrapped in. She added: ‘It was alive! And crying for its mama! It should not have been possible for that puppy to be alive that much later when we couldn’t get it to respond right away.’ Aww-some: The tiny puppy began crying for its mother leaving vets in a state of disbelief . Staff decided that there was only one possible name for the puppy – Miracle. After the dramatic birth the mother and Miracle spent the night under close observation and have now gone into foster care, the Facebook post explained. As Gary Beasley commented, it’s not quite a Miracle on 34th Street, ‘but it’ll do’.","Staff at the Aurora Animal Shelter described the event as 'impossible'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:12 EST, 15 August 2011 . Supercop: William Bratton is being brought in as an adviser but has staked a claim for the top Met job . David Cameron's new adviser on gang warfare would be prepared to become a British citizen to become head of the Met Police. American 'supercop' Bill Bratton has told friends he is prepared to swap his nationality if it made any difference to the selection process for the country's top police job. Mr Bratton, credited with turning around the New York Police Department and its Los Angeles counterpart, said he believed an outsider could reinvigorate a police force. He told the Guardian: 'I've been an outsider in every department I've worked in. Bureaucrats change processes, leaders change culture. 'I think of myself as a transformational leader who changes cultures.' It came as police chiefs and Boris Johnson made an outspoken attack yesterday on David Cameron's calls for zero tolerance policing. In a new broadside about plans for 20 per cent budget cuts to the police, the Mayor of London insisted that crime will come down only if there are more police on the streets. Senior policemen angrily denounced . Home Secretary Theresa May for suggesting that it was politicians who . turned around the initially sluggish police response to last week’s . riots. Sir Hugh Orde, . president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, complained that . commanders had their hands tied by human rights laws. Zero tolerance: David Cameron today . promised a new tough approach to all forms of street crime - but he has . been criticised by Sir Hugh Orde, right . The increasingly acrimonious relationship between politicians and police gained new impetus yesterday when Mr Cameron signalled his support for Mr Bratton’s zero tolerance approach to cleaning up crime when he ran the police departments in New York and Los Angeles. Mr Bratton was initially mooted as the next Metropolitan Police Commissioner - a positions in which he said he was 'seriously interested - but the idea was blocked by Mrs May. Instead, Mr Bratton will join a taskforce on gangs. In an interview published yesterday, Mr Cameron said: ‘We haven’t talked the language of zero tolerance enough but the message is getting through.’ Sir Hugh Orde said tough U.S. tactics advocated by Mr Bratton would not be possible in Britain because of the European Convention on Human Rights. He said: ‘I am not sure I want to learn about gangs from an area of America that has 400 of them. It seems to me, if you’ve got 400 gangs, then you’re not being very effective. Happy at the top: Mr Bratton, right, during a visit to London in 2006 with former London Mayor Ken Livingstone and former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Ian Blair . 'If you look at the style of policing in the States, and their levels of violence, they are fundamentally different from here.’ He added: ‘What I suggested to the Home Secretary is a more sensible approach, maybe to look across far wider styles of policing and – more usefully – at European styles; they, like us, are bound by the European Convention.’ In an interview in today's Guardian Bratton said his position within the Met was no different to Orde's in Northern Ireland when he too was an outsider as an Englishman. Mr Bratton said: 'I find it ironical the hue and cry about outsiders,' adding that he had faced similar situations in New York and LA. He added: 'The Met is having its share of issues and leadership crises, certainly. It is a mirror image of when I went into the NYPD and LAPD, and both those cities turned out quite well. 'I've been an outsider in every department I've worked in. Bureaucrats change processes, leaders change culture. I think of myself as a transformational leader who changes cultures.' In a further crack at zero tolerance plans, Chief Constable Chris Sims of West Midlands Police said he would not be ‘slavishly adopting empty slogans’. ‘Officers have been overwhelmed by the support shown by the public and it feels a million miles from the debates apparently raging in Westminster,’ he said. Mr Bratton, who will advise a Government taskforce on gangs, said yesterday that he had cut murders in New York by nearly half and gang crimes in LA by 60 per cent in eight years. ‘I do know about gangs. I understand the way they operate, the way they generate and the need for the Government to tackle them head on,’ he said. He added that British gangs are ‘much smaller and less sophisticated than in LA. Still, there are certain methods that have proved very successful in America which could be used to great effect here’. He said he would employ injunctions limiting the movement of gang members, higher sentences for crimes committed by gangs, and ex-gang members as ‘interventionists’ to steer current members away from gangs. The Prime Minister has promised the new tough approach after rioting in the UK. Here the Reeves furniture store in Croydon goes up in flames during the disturbances . But Boris Johnson used the news to reopen his offensive against police cuts. He pointed out that Mr Bratton cut crime in New York and Los Angeles only because he flooded the streets with police. The Mayor said: ‘His particular success in tackling crime in New York was very much due to a huge ramp up in numbers from about 30,000 to 42,000 officers in New York, that was instrumental in his success. 'In the end there’s going to have to be an argument about money. The case I make to Government and I’m going to continue to make is that numbers matter. People need to see police out there on the streets.’ 'In the end there’s going to have to be . an argument about money. The case I make to Government and I’m going to . continue to make is that numbers matter. People need to see police out . there on the streets' - Boris Johnson . Police chiefs began speaking out last week after Mr Cameron and Mrs May both criticised the initial police response to the riots and then sought to claim credit for the deployment of 16,000 officers on the streets of London. MP Mark Pritchard, secretary of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said: ‘Sir Hugh Orde’s very public and ill-judged remarks underline the need for the Coalition Government to push ahead with elected police commissioners. ‘Senior officers are not a law unto themselves and should not think they have a monopoly of wisdom.’ Tory MP Dominic Raab said Sir Hugh’s comments about human rights were ‘daft’. ‘There is no serious human rights reason for not learning lessons from U.S. experience of visible, robust and pro-active policing, and tailoring them to Britain,’ he said. ‘It’s sound policy and exactly what the public want to see now.’ Last night the Home Affairs Select Committee announced plans for an inquiry into the riots to find out where to apportion the blame and the credit. Mr Johnson, Mrs May, Mr Bratton and the bosses of mobile phone companies used by the rioters to co-ordinate their looting will be summoned to give evidence. Chairman Keith Vaz sent pointed questions to police chiefs around the country asking how many officers they deployed on each day of the riots, who ordered the surge in police numbers and whether they have the resources they need.","Chiefs round on Cameron's new police advisor .

The world will have a 30 minute warning when a once-in-a-century solar 'superstorm' strikes the Earth knocking out major communications, scientists revealed. Superstorms occur every 200 years, with the last storm striking in 1859, and scientists are preparing for the event which could paralyze communications networks including GPS and mobile phones. The news comes as it is revealed a new body of space experts is needed to help protect Britain from the storm. The Royal Academy of Engineering has said that the massive radiation blast is inevitable and that the Government should set up a UK Space Weather Board. Danger: Scientists have called for action to protect Britain for a one-in-a-century solar superstorm . The quango would lead and supervise . government strategy for coping with the Sun storm that could trigger . black-outs, knock out one in 10 satellites, and disrupt aircraft and . shipping navigation. Although solar weather events happen on a regular basis, the Earth has not experienced a superstorm since the start of the space age. On that occasion, Earth was hit by a tidal wave of energetic particles following a large solar flare. Induced currents caused by the blast sent sparks flying from telegraph pylons and caused fires. Around the world, night skies were lit up by magnificent aurora displays. But at that time there were no satellites in orbit or sensitive microchips in the path of the particles. Experts now warn that another solar superstorm on the scale of the Carrington event is 'inevitable' and Britain should be prepared. Professor Paul Cannon, who chaired the Academy's working group on extreme solar weather, said: 'The two challenges for government are the wide spectrum of technologies affected today and the emergence of unexpected vulnerabilities as technology evolves. 'The Academy recommends that government sets up a Space Weather Board to oversee these issues across government departments. Radiation blast: A solar superstorm could trigger black-outs and knock out one in 10 satellites . 'Our message is: Don't panic, but do prepare - a solar superstorm will happen one day and we need to be ready for it.' Around one in 10 orbiting satellites could be knocked out for days during a superstorm event, said the report. Those that keep operating would be aged 'enormously', making it necessary for many to be replaced. GPS signals would be interrupted one to three days after the storm hit as satellite transmissions to the ground are disrupted. As a result sat-nav systems would be rendered inoperable. Navigating officers in aircraft and ships would temporarily have to revert to old-fashioned 'dead reckoning', said Prof Cannon. His advice to motorists was 'make sure you continue to keep a map in your car'. Energetic particles penetrating lower levels of the atmosphere could also interfere with aircraft electronics. Space engineer Keith Ryden, from the University of Surrey, another member of the working group, said: 'The most likely scenario is that data elements get corrupted. It's possible that individual chips could fail. The systems are designed to cope with a certain amount of failure. Threat: A superstorm could cause problems for aircraft by knocking out their navigation systems . 'What would be of concern is if we had multiple failures for the pilot to deal with so he becomes overloaded.' But he added: 'We're not talking about aircraft dropping out of the sky.' Other effects of a solar superstorm would be to send large induced currents through the electricity grid network, potentially knocking out central transformers and causing blackouts. For passengers on high flying aircraft, a superstorm would also deliver a radiation dose equivalent to three CT scans. This would still be below harmful levels, said the experts - but astronauts aboard the International Space Station could be at risk. A solar superstorm would have proved lethal for the Apollo astronauts had one occurred when they were on the Moon. Currently an ageing satellite called Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) provides around 15 minutes warning of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) - a huge plasma cloud of charged particles that causes the most damage during a solar storm. Scientists are concerned about what will happen if Ace fails. A replacement for Ace, called Discover, is due to be launched by the American space agency Nasa in 2014.","Experts warn that superstorm is 'inevitable' and call for UK to be prepared .

The final Connecticut police report into the Sandy Hook school shooting massacre is expected to be released today. The planned release of thousands of pages of police documents from the investigation could shed additional light on the world of the 20-year-old gunman. State police released their report totaling several thousand pages at 3pm on Friday. The report 'has been redacted according to law,' and includes text, photos and 911 calls received by state police. A makeshift memorial with crosses for the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre stands outside a home in Newtown, Connecticut to mark the one-year anniversary of the tragedy . Connecticut state police are set to release a second report today concluding their investigation of the Newtown school shooting last year that left 20 children and six women dead . Prosecutors issued a summary of the investigation last month that portrayed the gunman, Adam Lanza, as obsessed with mass murders, but the report concluded that Lanza's motives for the massacre might never be known. The summary report referred to items found on a computer at Lanza's house that included writings detailing relationships, personal beliefs, a daily schedule, desires, goals and other topics. Lanza gunned down 20 first-graders and six educators with a semi-automatic rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, after killing his mother inside their home. He committed suicide with a handgun as police arrived at the school. To try to figure out the motive, investigators said, they interviewed members of Lanza's family, teachers and others. They said they also tried within the limits of privacy laws to gather information on his medical treatment. Mourners support each other at a memorial following the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting. A final report on the criminal investigation will be released today . Tribute: Crosses and a Star of David were erected in memory of the victims of the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre . Lanza 'was undoubtedly afflicted with mental health problems; yet despite a fascination with mass shootings and firearms, he displayed no aggressive or threatening tendencies,' it said. Adam Lanza gunned down 20 first-graders and six educators last December . In fifth grade, Lanza wrote The Big Book of Granny, in which the main character has a gun in her cane and shoots people, and another character talks of liking to hurt people, especially children. The book was among items seized from Lanza's home, but there was no indication he ever handed in the book at school. Lanza became obsessed with the 1999 bloodbath at Columbine High in Colorado and other mass killings, the report said. He also kept a spreadsheet ranking mass murders. The report also said that in 2005, . Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger's disorder - an autism-like condition . that is not associated with violence - and that he lacked empathy for . others and behaved strangely. Nobody . was allowed into his room, not even to clean, according to the report. It said Lanza also disliked birthdays, Christmas and holidays and did . not like to have his hair cut. He . also wouldn't touch doorknobs, his food had to be arranged on the plate . in a certain way, and he changed clothes often during the day.

The moving set of 16 photographs shows survivors of the Ohrdruf concentration camp. Many are on the brink of starvation, others are being treated by U.S army doctors. The photographer Ron Johnson, then a lieutenant and army medic, had mentioned then to his grandson Matthew Nash only once before he died in 1991. Documentary maker Matthew Nash with a World War II era photo of his grandfather U.S. Army medic Donald Johnson, whose pictures of the liberation of a Nazi concentration camp inspired him to make his latest film . The summer he was 12, Nash asked about . his grandfather's World War II service as the two were stacking wood in . his grandparents' barn in East Dorset, Vt. 'As . I recall he got really quiet,' said Nash, now a 37-year-old photography . professor at Lesley University. 'I think he just said, `Yeah, we saw . some really terrible things.

Now some 68 years after they were taken, they are the subject of a new documentary that Nash spent three years making. Kept hidden from Nash and . others in the family, the photos were not something Nash's grandfather . seemed to want to talk about with relatives. But they were something he . could never forget. Nash's film - '16 Photographs at Ohrdruf' - tells of the first concentration camp that U.S. soldiers liberated in 1945. A skeletal-looking prisoners stands in front of one of the concentration camp buildings. Ohrdruf concentration camp in Germany was the first that the Americans found . The . 72-minute film will have its first public screening Thursday evening at . Lesley University in Cambridge, Mass., and also will be shown as part . of the Boston International Film Festival on April 16 and the G.I. Film . Festival in Washington in May. Lieutenant Ron Johnson, who served as an army medic took the moving set of photographs in 1945 . When . Nash's grandmother threatened to destroy them when the subject came up . at Thanksgiving dinner in 1995, Nash and his sister felt compelled to . secretly sift through their late grandfather's belongings the following . Christmas. That's when they found an envelope . marked 'Holocaust' tucked away in a wooden trunk. Inside were a few . letters and a series of snapshots of a war horror the 23-year-old . Johnson encountered as a soldier in April 1945. Johnson . took most of the photos at Ohrdruf in Germany. Nash believes his . grandfather may have treated survivors of the camp, which the Germans . had formed as a sub-camp of Buchenwald. On . a personalized sheet of notepaper with 'Don Johnson' printed at the . top, the 65th Infantry Division Army veteran cataloged the photo . collection as best he could. 'Lime Pit - effort to destroy bodies,' reads one handwritten caption. 'Griddle used in (vain) attempt to . incinerate bodies - note skull bottom center,' reads another. 'Small . stack of bodies,' says yet another. Soldiers . are on the outskirts of some of Johnson's shots, standing together to . view piles of emaciated and burned corpses. Gen. Dwight D.

U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. He said in one letter that he had . visited more than one concentration camp, but Ohrdruf was engraved in . his memory. 'I keep the pictures close at hand and have made a point of looking at them frequently,' Johnson wrote. 'And, during my years of National Guard service, I made a point of showing them to the personnel, hoping we could prevent any such disasters from happening again.' Johnson died two years before the . museum opened, and before he sent the pictures. Nash has since given the . photos to the museum for its archives, and said he's proud to have done . that for his grandfather. Nash made the documentary with about $5,000 and the help of friends in the film business. Among . film interviewees, Nash talked to veterans who served in the same . infantry division as his grandfather, including Boston resident Edwin . 'Bud' Waite. The 87-year-old was an infantry soldier who wasn't part of . liberating concentration camps, but visited Dachau later. He said he . sees value in Nash's film effort. 'I . think it's very important because the younger people nowadays, they . don't really understand concentration camps back in World War II,' Waite . said. Ohrdruf concentration camp was part of the Buchenwald network of camps. In this file picture taken on April 16, 1945 inmates of the German KZ Buchenwald camp near Weimar are seen inside their barracks, a few days after liberation . Megargee, who will give a lecture before Thursday's screening, said Nash's film opens up a personal window into what the Allies were fighting against in World War II. 'When you can personalize the history, especially for younger kids, it helps to get them interested. It's one thing to talk about tens of thousands of camps. It's another thing to bring it down to the level of one American soldier,' he said.","Set of 16 photographs shows survivors at the Ohrdruf concentration camp .

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 05:42 EST, 8 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:11 EST, 8 February 2013 . U.S. space agency Nasa has released a frightening new video showing just how close a massive asteroid will come to slamming into the Earth next week. There are just seven days left until the 150ft-wide, 130,000 ton asteroid buzzes past our planet so close its trajectory will take it inside the orbit of communications and weather satellites. It will be the nearest known flyby for an object of this size. But scientists promise the threatening space rock come no nearer than 17,100 miles from Earth when it zips past next Friday. 'No Earth impact is possible,' said Donald Yeomans, manager of NASA's Near-Earth Object program at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. However, he added, its journey through space will bring it so close to our planet that stargazers from Eastern Europe to Australia will be able to see it with just a pair of binoculars. A few hundred satellites orbit at 22,300 miles, higher than the asteroid's path, but Dr Yeomans and other scientists say the chance of it hitting one is also extremely remote. Nevertheless, satellite operators are being warned about the incoming object for tracking purposes. 'No one has raised a red flag, nor will they,' Dr Yeomans said last night. 'I certainly don't anticipate any problems whatsoever.' As yet impossible to see with the naked eye, the asteroid is considered small as these things go. By contrast, the one that took out the dinosaurs 65million years ago was 6 miles wide. Disturbance: This graphic depicts the trajectory of asteroid 2012 DA14 on Feb 15, 2013. This view looks down from above Earth's north pole and shows how the rock will hurtle past inside the ring of geo-stationary satellites . Approach: The trajectory of the asteroid as seen from horizontally from the Earth's equatorial plane. It will come within 17,000 miles of earth . Yet Asteroid 2012 DA14, as it's known for its discovery date, still could pack a wallop. If it struck Earth - which it won't, scientists were quick to add - it would release the energy equivalent of 2.4million tons of TNT and wipe out everything for 750 square miles around the impact site. That's what happened in Siberia in 1908, when forest land around the Tunguska River was obliterated by a slightly smaller asteroid that exploded about five miles above ground. The likelihood of something this size striking Earth is once in every 1,200 years; a close encounter like this is thought to occur every 40 years. The bulk of the solar system's asteroids are located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and remain stable there for billions of years. Some occasionally pop out, though, into Earth's neighborhood. The closest approach of this one will occur next Friday evening, around 7.30pm Greenwich Mean Time, over Indonesia. There won't be much of a show. The asteroid will zip by at 17,400mph - roughly eight times faster than a bullet from a high-speed rifle. The asteroid will be invisible to the naked eye and even with binoculars and telescopes will appear as a small point of light. Prime viewing locations will be in Asia, Australia and eastern Europe. Observers in the U.S. and UK will even be able to see that, Nasa says. Astronomers using NASA's deep-space antenna in California's Mojave Desert will have to wait eight hours after the closest approach to capture radar images. But the scientists welcome whatever pictures they get since the asteroid offers a unique opportunity to observe something this big and close. Any new knowledge will help if and when another killer asteroid is headed our way. The . close approach also highlights the need to keep track of what's out . there, if for no other reason than to protect the planet. So . far Nasa has counted just short of 10,000 near-Earth objects, the . result of a concentrated effort for the past 15 years - and that's . thought to be less than 10 per cent of the objects out there. No one has ruled out a serious Earth impact, although the probability is said to be extremely low. 'We don't have all the money in the world to do this kind of work' for tracking and potentially deflecting asteroids, said Lindley Johnson, an executive with the Near-Earth Object observations program in Washington. But when asked about Nasa plans to send astronauts to an asteroid in coming decades, outlined a few years ago by President Barack Obama, Colonel Johnson (ret.) said the agency is looking at a number of options for human explorations. One of the more immediate steps, planned for 2016, is the launch of a spacecraft to fly to a much bigger asteroid, collect samples and return them to Earth in 2023. As for Asteroid 2012 DA14 - discovered last year by astronomers in Spain - scientists suspect it's made of silicate rock, but aren't sure. Its shape and precise size also are mysteries. Colonel Johnson echoed Dr Yeoman's certainty that the asteroid would not hit Earth. He said he anticipates no 'sky is falling thing' related to next week's flyby. In fact, Dr Yeomans said, asteroid's close approach will will alter its orbit around the sun in such a way as to keep it out of Earth's neighborhood, at least in the foreseeable future. He and other scientists urged journalists to keep the close encounter in perspective. 'Space rocks hit the Earth's atmosphere on a daily basis. Basketball-size objects come in daily. Volkswagen-size objects come in every couple of weeks,' Dr Yeomans said.","Nasa insists 150ft-wide, 130,000 ton asteroid will NOT hit Earth .

A teenage paedophile viciously raped a girl of 11 while he was on probation for another sex crime. Opemipo Jaji – who was ‘obsessed with little white girls’ – dragged the girl into a park after she got off a bus from school. She had tried to run away from him, but he caught up with her before repeatedly raping her over a three-hour period. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Opemipo Jaji is facing a life sentence for attacking an 11-year-old girl . After the attack, the girl told police . she tried to escape twice, but Jaji threatened to stab her, saying ‘I . am this close to killing you’. The attack took place 90 minutes after the 18-year-old had been seen by his  probation officer. The trainee chef now faces life in jail after he was found guilty of the November rape at the Old Bailey yesterday. Serious questions over how the . authorities handled Jaji were raised last night after it emerged he was . convicted of another sexual assault a year earlier. In September 2011 he admitted . attacking a 12-year-old in the same area of north London. He forced her . to strip after grabbing her on her way home from school. Jaji was sent to a young offenders’ institution for five months, but he was not registered as a sex offender. Within weeks of his release he was . convicted of possessing the most obscene category of images of child . abuse after downloading videos of white girls. He was given an 18-month youth rehabilitation order which required him to be supervised by the probation service. Jaji told the court: 'I'm not capable of doing something as despicable and heartless as this' Jaji was unanimously convicted at the Old Bailey of raping the 11 year-old after the brave youngster gave evidence against him . Jaji attended a meeting with a . probation officer as part of his ‘rehabilitation’ on the afternoon he . raped the schoolgirl in Enfield, north London. The apprentice chef was unanimously convicted of raping the 11-year-old and the judge, Mr Justice Singh, will now consider jailing him indefinitely to protect the public . Yesterday the Ministry of Justice . ordered two investigations into the handling of Jaji’s case. The police, . probation service, social services and other agencies who dealt with . the teenager will be required to provide details of their involvement. CCTV footage showed him watching the . girl from the back of a bus as she chatted excitedly with a school . friend. He then followed her off the bus as she waved goodbye to her . friend and then dragged her into the park. He denied the offence, forcing the little girl to give evidence at his trial. She told the jury: ‘He said he was . going to let me go but I couldn’t tell anyone or he would stab me. He . said “I’m this close to killing you”.’ Jaji also threatened to film the rape and send copies to children at her school and ‘everyone she loved’. At the trial, the girl’s father . revealed his traumatised daughter came home and said: ‘I think I’ve been . raped’. ‘As you can imagine, we were devastated by what she had said. I . had my arm around her. She was shivering,’ he said. The girl needed emergency surgery for severe injuries she sustained and was in hospital for two days. Jaji was arrested two days later by a . local Police Community Support Officer who realised that he matched the . description given by the victim. Traces of his victim’s blood were found . on his bag and trainers. Jaji had been to a meeting with his probation officer just 90 minutes before the attack . Police search teams in Jubilee Park in Enfield looking for clues at the time of the rape in November 2012 . When police raided his home they . discovered adverts from parents looking for child-minders and details . about apprenticeships in childcare. Officers also found newspaper . clippings about April Jones, the five-year-old girl who went missing . from her home in Wales last October. Jaji, of Edmonton, north London, . also used Facebook to reel in child victims from all over the world. On his page, he wrote: ‘Warning. Dangerously sexy person owns this page.’ Yesterday he was accused of pleading . not guilty, despite overwhelming evidence against him, so that he could . force the girl to relive her ordeal by having to give evidence for his . sexual gratification. Andy Love, MP for Edmonton, said: ‘I’m . shocked by the admissions that have come out since the guilty verdict. It’s amazing that this girl had to go through such a brutal and horrific . attack when it was clear that this young man had quite a long history . of deviant sexual behaviour. ‘Clearly we need a proper investigation into what happened.

Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock falsely claimed Richard Drax, 55, and wife Elsebet groped her and tried to perform a sex act on her . The lesbian housekeeper who falsely accused a Tory MP of trying to lure her into a threesome with his wife has claimed her life has been ruined by the ordeal. Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock falsely claimed Richard Drax, 55, and wife Elsebet groped her and tried to perform a sex act on her as they drank wine in the sitting room of their Elizabethan stately home. The case against the South Dorset MP  was dismissed at an employment tribunal after her former lover revealed she had made a series of similar claims in the past. Judge Roger Peters, rejected all of her ‘utterly incredible’ claims at a hearing in Southampton. But in an interview with the Sun, Ms Lyndoe-Tavistock insisted it was her life that has been left in tatters. She said her whole life had been 'turned upside down' after the tribunal, and that she had 'lost everything'. She insists she does not regret taking legal action, but that it had had a huge effect on her. She said: 'I have lost my home, my job, and I have even had to sell the horses that I loved - I was pretty much left with nothing.' She added that it had been a 'horrible week'. Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock, 53, who lived in the Drax ancestral home, after previously working there as a groom, has received two other payouts in the last 15 years after bringing claims against former bosses, the tribunal heard. The housekeeper’s claims were dismissed when her estranged civil partner claimed that Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock had concocted the story for financial gain. Jo Lyndoe-Tavistock, who is divorcing her, said her former partner wanted to ‘satisfy a grudge’ and that her attitude when she was in a dispute was one of ‘I have an issue with that person, how can I get them back?’ She said her ex had brought a claim against the Royal Mail involving an alleged sexual assault, receiving a payout of £15,960. The case against the South Dorset MP Richard Drax (pictured here with his wife Elsebet) was dismissed at an employment tribunal after her former lover revealed she had made a series of similar claims in the past . She received another payout from the Royal Mail after alleging she had hurt her shoulder after the company overfilled a bag. She also received a £3,000 payout from a store where she was working after another dispute. Jo Lyndoe-Tavistock, who is divorcing her, said her former partner wanted to 'satisfy a grudge' Her ex-partner added said she believed the case against the MP was another attempt to 'extract money from an employer'. She told the hearing: 'She knows Mr Drax is a public figure and I imagine she thought he was in a strong position to secure a settlement from him as I know she has done from previous employers. 'I believe she concocted the allegations in her claim to cause embarrassment to Mr and Mrs Drax and their family in the expectation that she would receive a financial settlement.' A few weeks after the alleged assault, Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock said the MP told her she had an hour to leave, citing a series of fallings out she had had with other members of staff. She said he gave her £300 and a letter falsely claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and that a severance deal would be drawn up. The housekeeper's former partner told the tribunal that when she spoke to her after she had been sacked by the MP, she boasted she had something 'big' on him. The housekeeper had claimed sexual discrimination, unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal and for unpaid holiday pay. Mr Drax wiped his eyes as he sat holding his wife's hand as chairman of the panel, Judge Roger Peters, rejected her 'utterly incredible' claims. Outside, the MP said. 'This finding vindicates our position throughout these proceedings that we acted lawfully and properly and that her serious allegations of sexual discrimination were untrue. 'These allegations have been extremely stressful for my wife and I, and my children, and my family. We are all now relieved that we can put these matters behind us.'","Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock falsely accused Richard Drax, 55, and wife Elsebet .

A Taliban bomb-maker suspected of directing an attack that killed three British soldiers could be freed within weeks if lawyers win their battle to close the ‘British Guantanamo’, it was claimed last night. Defence sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the terrorist leader is being held at a controversial prison within Camp Bastion. But after pressure from human rights lawyers, the Taliban explosives expert is likely to be released into the notoriously corrupt Afghan judicial system, with the danger that he will be freed to launch fresh attacks. Imprisoned: A Taliban bomb-maker suspected of directing an attack that killed three British soldiers could be freed from the Camp Bastion prison (file picture) Controversial: The British prison at Camp Bastion may be closed following the intervention of British human rights lawyers and the inmates are likely to be transferred to an Afghan jail . Three British troops died and six others were wounded five weeks ago when their Mastiff armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device (IED) planted in the Nahr-e Saraj  district of Helmand province. The deaths of Corporal William  Savage, 30, Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, brought the number of British service personnel deaths since operations began in 2001 in Afghanistan to 444. Days after the attack, British Special Forces uncovered a cache of home-made bombs five miles from the blast site. Troops followed up this success by capturing the suspected bomb-maker and four accomplices. Killed: Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, left, and Private Robert Heatherington were both killed when their Mastiff armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device five weeks ago . Victim: Corporal William Savage, 30, pictured with his wife Lyndsey, was the third soldier killed in the IED attack in Nahr-e Saraj, Helmand Province . Now, following the intervention of . British human rights lawyers, the Camp Bastion prison is facing closure . and the inmates are likely to be transferred to an Afghan jail. Defence sources are adamant that the country’s legal system remains corrupt and that suspected terrorists could be released by the courts or freed in Taliban raids. Last night, former Government Defence Minister Sir Gerald Howarth attacked the move, saying it will put British soldiers’ lives at risk. Attack: Former Defence minister Gerald Howarth said the move was putting British soldiers' lives at risk . ‘Taliban IED technicians represent a . very serious threat to British personnel. So we should not connive in . any measure that results in them being able to continue operations . against our troops,’ he said. ‘I . am also sick and tired of human rights being evoked to defend or . protect those who seek to destroy us and take the lives of members of . Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. So absolutely no way should he or anyone . else be transferred  or released before the end of 2014 when British . troops withdraw from Afghanistan.’ Public . Interest Lawyers, which is acting for eight of the approximately 80 . inmates at the Camp Bastion prison, told this newspaper that its clients . are being mistreated by UK guards. It claims that torture techniques such as sleep and sensory deprivation, blindfolding and a process called ‘harshing’ – when guards stand just inches in front of the inmates and  suddenly scream abuse – are being used to extract information and  confessions. It is also claimed that some inmates have been held without charge for up to 14 months – apparently in breach of UK and International law. Last night the Ministry of Defence insisted that the inmates are treated humanely and that the jail has been inspected by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers said: ‘The MoD need to find a lawful solution to a problem of their own making.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is expected to write this week to lawyers representing inmates, giving 21 days’ notice of their transfer to an Afghan jail. A MoD spokesman said: ‘We have been working with the Afghan authorities since November to identify an effective safe route to transfer detainees into the Afghan judicial system for prosecution and we intend to put forward our plans shortly.’ Armoured vehicle: A Mastiff 2 similar to the one carrying the soldiers, from The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, when their vehicle was struck .","Terrorist leader being held at a prison within Camp Bastion .

Walking dead: Graham Harrison from Exeter has been diagnosed with rare condition called Cotardís syndrome where he is convinced he is a zombie . A man diagnosed with a rare zombie condition today told of his nine years of hell thinking he was the living dead. Graham Harrison, 57, was convinced he had died despite a botched suicide attempt - and even took to hanging around in graveyards. He believed his brain had 'fried' after trying to electrocute himself and must be dead, even though he was still breathing. Doctors diagnosed Cotard's Syndrome - . otherwise known as walking corpse syndrome - one of the rarest diseases . in the world, affecting just a few hundred people. Delusional . sufferers believe they are dead, or that parts of their body no longer . exist, and often die from starvation because they feel they no longer . have to eat. Graham, a . former water contractor from Exeter, Devon, woke up after a botched . suicide attempt amazed he was able to talk - because he was convinced he . had no brain. He said: 'I just got annoyed. I didn't . know how I could speak or do anything with no brain because as far as I . was concerned I hadn't got one. 'My mind was blank. I couldn't hold any information in it. I took no pleasure from anything. Underactive: Image shows the areas of Graham's brain which are underactive (coloured in blue) in comparison with a healthy person . Rare condition: The scans show how Mr Harrison's brain has changed the way it performs with large areas now underactive (coloured in blue) compared to a healthy person . 'I . lost my sense of small and my sense of taste. There was no point in . eating because I was dead. It was a waste of time speaking because I . never had anything to say.' The final nail in the coffin came when . Graham felt compelled to go to his local cemetery because he felt it . was the only place he could fit in. Cases of Cotard’s Syndrome date back to 1788 but it was formally identified by French neurologist Jules Cotard in 1880. Among the handful of cases over the years was a 53-year-old woman in New York who in 2008 claimed that she stank like rotting fish because she was dead. Like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, Cotard’s is another form of delusional psychosis, the only self-certifiable form of its kind. Those with this condition often describe a loss of blood, organs and/or body parts. This distorted reality is caused by a malfunction in an area of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which recognizes faces, and also in the amygdala, an almond-shaped set of neurons that processes your emotions. The combination is a lack of recognition when viewing familiar faces (even the face of the sufferer), leaving the person feeling disconnected with reality. There is no current cure for Cotard’s Syndrome. Common treatments include anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, as well as the controversial electroconvulsive therapy. He said: 'I just felt I might as well stay there. It was the closest I could get to death. The police would come and get me, though, and take me back home.' Baffled doctors put Graham in touch with neurologist Adam Zeman, from the Exeter Medical School and Steven Laureys at the University of Leige, in Belgium. Mr Laureys said: 'It's the first and only time my secretary has said to me, ""It's really important for you to come and speak to this patient because he's telling me he's dead"". 'He was a really unusual patient.' Graham's recovery began after scans . found that levels of activity in parts of his brain were so low they . almost matched the brain of somebody in a vegetative state. Mr . Laureys added: 'I've been analysing scans for 15 years and I've never . seen anyone who was on his feet, who was interacting with people, with . such an abnormal scan result. 'Graham's brain function resembled that of someone during anaesthesia or sleep.' Years . of psychotherapy and drug treatment, combined with help from carers and . his brother, mean Graham gradually recovered and he is no longer in the . grip of the disorder. 'I don't feel brain dead any more,' he said. 'I can't say I am really back to normal, but I feel a lot better now.' Nightmare: Graham Harrison, from Exeter, began hanging around cemeteries after suffering from Cotard's Syndrome which made him believe he was dead . Morbid: Graham Harrison said he started hanging around cemeteries because it was the only place he thought he fitted in after suffering from Cotard's Syndrome - also referred to as Walking Corpse Syndrome.

A retired company director who was forced to wait more than six hours for an ambulance died later that day in hospital. On the day Rodney Butcher became seriously unwell, East Midlands Ambulance Service was 'struggling to cope' - and paramedics had to be called out three times before the pensioner was seen. The 76-year-old had developed a severe infection and his GP had requested an ambulance to take him to hospital within four hours. Mr Butcher arrived at the Royal Derby Hospital more than two hours later than planned and was taken straight to accident and emergency department . But, when it did not arrive on time, concerned staff at Mr Butcher’s nursing home rang 999 twice. An inquest into his death heard these calls actually made the situation worse because they cancelled out the original request for an ambulance and caused further delay. It meant that Mr Butcher, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, arrived at the Royal Derby Hospital more than two hours later than planned and was taken straight to accident and emergency department, where he later died. Although the inquest heard the delay did not contribute to his death, EMAS said it had now reviewed its policy on how it deals with separate calls to a single incident. Derby and South Derbyshire Coroner’s Court heard how Mr Butcher was receiving respite care at the Old Lodge Nursing Home, in Etwall, in November 2012. Mr Butcher was receiving respite care at the Old Lodge Nursing Home, for type-two diabetes, Parkinson¿s disease and Alzheimer's disease . At the time, Mr Butcher was suffering from type-two diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer's disease. Signs of a bladder infection prompted staff at the home to call an out-of-hours emergency care practitioner to take a look at him. The inquest heard the practitioner, Stephen Meakins, diagnosed Mr Butcher with a urinary tract infection. He was put on antibiotics and care home staff were told to seek further medical help if his condition deteriorated. Three days later, Mr Butcher’s condition had worsened, so staff called in Dr Michael Vickers, of the Wellbrook Medical Centre, for another check-up and at 2.30pm the GP diagnosed him with 'uncontrolled diabetes and possible urinary sepsis'. He said: 'It was fairly apparent he needed to be in hospital.' Dr Vickers returned to his surgery and at 2.50pm requested an ambulance to arrive within four hours and take Mr Butcher to the Royal Derby hospital. He said, on reflection, he should have called for an ambulance within two hours - but the inquest heard this would have been equally difficult for EMAS because of flooding and poor weather conditions. At 7.34pm care home staff rang 999 because he was concerned by the ambulance delay and said Mr Butcher had become 'very pale'. They were also called at 8.11pm. But Alison Crowe, service delivery manager for the emergency operations centre at EMAS, told the inquest how the original request for an ambulance was effectively cancelled and replaced by the new request. An ambulance eventually arrived at the care home at 9.27pm and reached the hospital at 10.28pm. Ms Crowe said EMAS’s policies had now been reviewed to avoid this issue arising again. Assistant coroner Paul McCandless, recording a narrative conclusion, said it was “more likely than not' that Mr Butcher would have died even if he had arrived at hospital on time. The medical cause of Mr Butcher’s death was given as diabetic ketoacidosis - a condition caused by high blood glucose levels due to a bladder infection. After the inquest, a spokesman for EMAS apologised to Mr Butcher’s family and said: 'We have reviewed our policies to make sure this does not happen again.' Mr Butcher’s family said they wanted to thank the ambulance service for 'putting their hands up' over the incident.","Pensioner Rodney Butcher suffered from type-two diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease and had developed severe infection .

While many Britons will have unwrapped gleaming new household appliances as presents this Christmas, one retired couple would not dream of replacing their 88-year-old vacuum cleaner - which also spray paints, grinds coffee, and even minces meat. Mary Waite, 61, and her husband Ivor, 63, have been using their Piccolo multi-purpose appliance since it was given to them as a wedding present in 1976. Remarkably, the plastic-and-metal gadget, which does four household chores in one (although presumably not at the same time), was built in 1925 but is still going strong today and has never broken down. Odd jobs: The ancient Piccolo multi-purpose machine comes with an array of adaptors to convert it into a vacuum cleaner, a coffee grinder and even a meat mincer . All in one: The Piccolo is as well suited to the garage or shed, with its drill and metal grinding extensions, as it was in the kitchen, with the food blender and meat mincer adaptors . The Piccolo - which cost 20 guineas, . around £25 in today’s money - works as a conventional vacuum cleaner . while another chamber can be used as a paint sprayer. It was made by German company Hammelmann Werke in the early 20th century and was promoted as the future of household appliances. Two other chambers operate as a coffee grinder and even a food processor, which specialises in mincing meat. Handy work: The vacuum appliance, as demonstrated by Mary Waite, 61, right, still works as well as it did when the manual, left, was printed almost a century ago . Handy: This picture taken from the Piccolo instruction manual illustrates just one of the many tasks to which the Piccolo could be put .

All-in-one: The motor in the Piccolo could drive a range of tools, including metal grinders and wire brushes . Hard grind: A man puts his Piccolo to work grinding off the rust from his car roof in this illustration from the instruction manual . Bygone: When the Piccolo left the factory in the . mid 1920s few people could have imagined it would still be put to use, . amongst other things, as a meed mincer, right, . Mary, a retired cleaner, from Halesowen, West Midlands, recently won a competition to find the oldest working appliance in the Black Country. The prize-winning device, which is showing no sign of its age, used to belong to an salesman uncle who had kept the unused Piccolo in storage for decades before it was eventually given to the couple as a wedding present. She said: 'My husband’s aunt gave us the Piccolo as a wedding gift. 'It was almost brand new and still in its wrapper so obviously had not been used very much.

Festival goers need never run out of phone battery again thanks to a new range of denim shorts and sleeping bags that use body heat and movement to generate electricity. The Power Shorts and Recharge Sleeping Bag can charge a phone's battery by harvesting energy from the human body using kinetic and thermoelectric technology. The wearable phone chargers have been designed by mobile phone company Vodafone with help from the University of Southampton. Vodafone has teamed up with the University of Southampton to create wearable phone chargers for festival goers. The Power Shorts, pictured,  capture kinect energy from the wearer's body movements. This energy can then be used to charge mobile handsets . This image explains how the Power Shorts work. They are fitted with foam-like ferroelectret smart materials which contain voids. The surfaces of these voids are permanently charged and as the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes,when they're squashed or deformed, a charge is produced . The shorts are fitted with a phone connector and ferroelectret materials. As the wearer moves, the shorts gather kinetic energy when these ferroelectret materials are squashed or deformed. The surfaces of these voids are permanently charged. As the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes, a charge is produced on the surface of the material. The Recharge Sleeping Bag harvests thermal energy using the 'Seebeck Effect'. This effect is a process that produces an electrical charge causes by the changes in temperature of a thermoelectric . module. These modules are printed on the fabric of the sleeping bag. The Power Shorts are fitted with foam-like ferroelectret materials. As the wearer moves, the shorts gather kinetic energy when these ferroelectret materials are squashed or deformed. These foam-like materials contain voids. The surfaces of these voids are permanently charged and exhibit piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties. The word piezoelectricity means electricity resulting from pressure. When pressure is applied to the materials in the shorts they generate an electric charge. As the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes this creates the electricity needed to charge the phone attached to the shorts by a connector inside the Power Pocket. The Recharge Sleeping Bag harvests thermal energy using the 'Seebeck Effect'. This effect creates pyroelectricity, which is the ability of certain materials to generate a temporary charge when they are heated up or cooled down. In the case of the sleeping bag, this process monitors the change of temperature through a thermoelectric . module fitted to the fabric of the bag. Heat from the sleeper's body flows through this module contained within a multi-layered 'power felt'. This felt contains polymer films and two semi conductors that generate an electric charge as they heat up. The Recharge Sleeping Bag works by harvesting thermal energy from the sleeper's body heat. As the wearer sleeps, thermoelectric modules capture thermal energy. These modules contain insulating polymer films and two semi conductors that create an electric voltage to charge the phone in the Power Pocket . Vodafone's Power Shorts and sleeping bag are not the first wearable phone chargers. In June 2010, phone operator Orange . announced its Power Wellies that have a power-generating sole which . converts heat from the wearer's feet into electrical current. This 'welectricity', as the makers call it, can then be used to charge a mobile phone. Twelve hours of stomping through the muddy fields of festival sites will give you one hour of phone use. Bouncing up and down in the dance . tent gives you even more call time - because the hotter your feet get, . the more energy is produced. The Power Wellies were created with renewable energy experts GotWind. Trials conducted by Vodafone found that a full day’s walking and dancing while wearing the shorts can provide enough energy to charge a phone for four hours. While heat from a night in the sleeping bag is said to create 11 hours of charge.

A lesbian who sued a Catholic Archdiocese that fired her after she was impregnated via artificial insemination  won a lawsuit against her former employer Monday alleging the termination violated anti-discrimination laws and has been awarded more than $170,000. The federal jury found the Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati discriminated against Christa Dias by firing her in 2010. Though she declined to comment immediately after the ruling, in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, Dias later said that she was 'very happy and relieved.' Scroll down for video... 'Relieved': Seen here with her daughter, Christa Dias sued an Ohio archdiocese after she was fired for becoming pregnant via artificial insemination. A jury ruled in her favor, awarding her over $170,000 Monday . Her attorney had argued she was fired simply because she was pregnant and unmarried, while attorneyâ€™s for the defendant claimed . it was the artificial insemination that got her the boot. It was the argument of archdiocese attorney Steven Goodin, that Dias agreed to a contract requiring her to follow Catholic teachings. The church considers artificial insemination immoral and a violation of church doctrine, and the contract required her to comply with the philosophies and teachings of the Catholic church, Goodin said. Discriminatory: A jury found that Dias, a computer teacher, was unfairly fired from two schools by the Cincinnati Catholic Archdiocese, which claimed she broke a contract that said she must follow Catholic doctrine . The jury said the archdiocese should pay $51,000 in back-pay, $20,000 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages. Dias, who taught computer classes, was fired by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati in October 2010 after informing the schools of her pregnancy, according to her attorney Robert Klingler. Dias had sued the archdiocese and two of its schools. The schools were not found liable. Dias is not Catholic but identifies as Christian. She said she was told that did not matter at her hiring. She also testified she didn't know artificial insemination violated church doctrine or the employment pact. She said she thought the contract clause about abiding by church teachings meant she should be a Christian and follow the Bible. Testifying on the second day of trial, Dias choked up at times and wiped tears from her eyes as she described her shock at being fired. Dias also has claimed that the church policies are not enforced equally against men and women, as a male former employee who worked in the youth ministry program testified that his wife was artificially inseminated and he was not fired or disciplined. Indoctrinated: Dias was fired by the archdiocese from two schools, including St. Lawrence school. She claimed in court she was unaware using artifical insemination violated her contract to obey chruch doctrine . Neither Dias nor the archdiocese claim she was fired because she is gay, and the judge told jurors that they could not consider sexual orientation in determining motivating factors for the firing. However, Goodin argued that that Dias never intended to abide by her contract because she kept her sexual orientation a secret because she knew homosexual actsâ€”like artificial insemination, it seemsâ€”violated her contract. 'That all goes to her credibility,' Goodin said. Dias, formerly from suburban Cincinnati, now lives in Atlanta with her partner and their 2-year-old daughter. They would have remained in Cincinnati if she had not been fired, Dias said. While the lawsuit didn't seek a specific amount in damages, Klingler suggested in his closing argument that $200,000 in compensatory damages would not be unreasonable for what Dias went through with the loss of her job and health insurance and the worry she experienced. Uprooted: Dias was also fired from the Holy Family School in Cincinnati. She has since relocated her 2-year-old daughter and partner to Atlanta, Georgia . He said Dias is not seeking punitive damages from the schools but that archdiocese officials knew or should have known that they were breaking the law and any punitive damages against the archdiocese should be double whatever compensatory damages might be set by the jury. That would show that what church leaders did was wrong and shouldn't happen again, Klingler said. Lost back pay amounting to about $37,000 would bring the total damages suggested to about $637,000. The case, viewed as a barometer on the degree to which religious organizations can regulate employees' lives, is the second lawsuit that's been filed in the last two years against the archdiocese over the firing of an unmarried pregnant teacher.","Christa Dias was awarded over $170,000 after a jury found her employers had violated anti-discrimination laws .

Cricket Australia are facing possible legal action for defamation from the ground announcer who was stood down for allegedly making racist remarks about Monty Panesar. David Nixon, video producer for Australian Broadcasting Company who helped out on the PA system for the Alice Springs game, is gathering evidence in support of his case with the help of ABC radio colleagues. It was reported by the Australian media that CA had acted after Nixon had pronounced Panesar’s name with an exaggerated Indian accent. A CA statement said they ‘deemed the conduct of the PA announcer as inappropriate and he will take no further part in the match.’ Controversy: David Nixon has denied making racist remarks about Monty Panesar (above) at Alice Springs . Not wise: And Cricket Australia, who also tweeted this picture captioned 'Will the real Monty Panesar please stand up?', could face legal action for standing him down . However Nixon says: ‘I’m considering my options because of the damage to my reputation. There is no way I mocked Monty with an Indian accent. I just said “Here’s Monty” loudly and in a jovial way as he came on to bowl. ‘CA have no evidence against me. We have dozens of witnesses agreeing there was no racist element to what I said.’ There is no recording of Nixon’s introduction to Panesar nor was any complaint made by the England touring party, who had no knowledge of the fuss until it appeared in the media.

Elite referee Lee Probert, who has been given three Premier League games over Christmas, had been a surprising absentee from the match list since November 9.

But a League spokesman described that theory as ‘nonsense’ and insisted that Probert, who was fit enough for Football League duty during that period, had a back problem affecting his foot and lacked the required fitness for the top flight.

Disgraced former New York governor Eliot Spitzer and his new girlfriend Lis Smith may have enjoyed  a relaxing family Christmas with her parents - but their cosy domesticity may soon be upset as she faces losing her job over their relationship. Spitzer, 54, and his long-suffering wife Silda announced the end of their marriage on Christmas Eve - just days after photos emerged of Spitzer leaving his lover's Soho apartment. Smith, 31, works as a spokesperson for mayor-elect Bill de Blasio and today a source denied that senior de Blasio aides have been interviewing replacements for a new communications director post. The source told MailOnline: 'Lis was brought on as part of de . Blasio's transition team and after that everything is to be determined. It's all in flux.' Scroll down for video . Meet my boyfriend! Lis Smith took her new boyfriend Eliot Spitzer home to Bronxville, seen here, to meet her parents on Christmas Day . Smith was a key part of de Blasio’s successful mayoral team, but her tryst with Spitzer has done her career few favors. Her future is uncertain after de Blasio said on Monday that he hadn’t decided whether to keep her on staff. He is reportedly unhappy at being blindsided when news of the affair broke, according to The New York Post. There is no love lost between De Blasio and Spitzer. In August, not long after Spitzer had launched his bid be become controller, de  Blasio called him a ‘child of the elite’ and praised his rival Scott Stringer for his 'real integrity.' The coverage that the affair has attracted has already prompted Spitzer and his estranged wife, Silda, to announce late on Tuesday that their marriage is officially over. Then on Christmas Day, Smith brought Spitzer to a party at her parents’ home in the Westchester village of Bronxville. What cold? Smith was unfazed by the freezing cold weather. Highs in New York were in 20s on Christmas Day, but Spitzer's new squeeze braved the temperatures in a sleeveless, above the knee dress with no pantyhose or tights, much less a jacket. On the trip to her mother's house in the suburbs, Smith let her dress do the talking: even though it was in the high 20s and low 30s, the chill didn't stop the 31-year-old from wearing a form-fitting black and tan sleeveless dress with bare legs and heels. She wore large sunglasses and avoided any contact with the huddled collection of paparazzi outside of the house, but her new boyfriend took a much more relaxed approach to the issue. The former governor wore khaki slacks and a navy sweater, and though he didn't say anything to the photographers, he gave them a quick wave before carrying presents into the home. Rumors have long circulated that the Spitzers were no longer a happy couple but they waited until Christmas Eve to formally announce that they were ending their marriage. 'We regret that our marital . relationship has come to an end and we have agreed not to make any other . public statement on this subject,' Spitzer family spokeswoman Lisa . Linden told MailOnline in a terse statement released on Tuesday night. It . is unclear whether the couple is already divorced or whether they are . planning to divorce. Ms Linden would not elaborate on the statement. Lis Smith, pictured on Sunday at a media event as part of Bill De Blasio's Transition Team, has been having late-night meet-ups with Eliot Spitzer which could well have cost her her job . Silda Spitzer stood by her husband Eliot's side as he admitted to using high-class prostitutes and resigned in 2008. The couple announced their marriage is over on Christmas Eve . New York mayor-elect Bill de Blasio is in the process of hiring his communications manager, Smith was considered a front runner until details about her relationship with Spitzer emerged . Multiple . reports indicate that the Spitzers have been living apart for some . time. Mrs Spitzer was noticeably absent from the campaign trail . this past . year. Since failing in his bid to become New . York City Controller, Spitzer has decided to focus on his family's real . estate business, just as he did when he lost office following the . prostitution scandal in 2008. Spitzer Enterprises just paid $88 million for a development site on Manhattan’s far West Side, reports the New York Daily News. Smith joined de Blasio after . Spitzer lost in the September primary. She has also served as the . spokeswoman for the Mayor-elect during his transition. She was believed to have been the frontrunner to become de Blasio's press secretary, but that was before news of her relationship emerged. In 2012, she led the 'rapid response team' on President Obama's reelection campaign. A . former colleague of Smith's told MailOnline: 'Lis is one of the . best political operatives in the country and her private dating life is . not going to change any of that. Her accomplishments stand on their . own.' Eliot Spitzer, left, has been seen at the apartment of Lis Smith late at night then leaving before dawn last week.

Airlines have been trying to squeeze every millimeter of profit out of the expensive industry and now passengers are starting to feel the pinch. A comfortable amount of legroom and reclining seats may well become a thing of the past since those are seen as easy revenue areas. Spirit and Southwest airlines are just two such companies who are doing whatever they can to make the most of every piece of space that they have. Packing them in: Airlines across the industry- including Easy Jet as seen here- are testing different ways to maximize space and turn a profit . The New York Times reports that Spirit Airlines now gives coach passengers the least amount of room, after installing seats that measured to have just 28 inches per person. As a result, the airline fits 178 people on their Airbus A320 planes rather than the general standard of 150. One of the ways that they were able to accomplish such a feat was by taking away passengers ability to move their seats back on their own accord. Instead, Spirit's coach seats are unmoveable, set permanently to lean three inches back. Airline representatives are trying to sell this as a benefit for the flyer, however. 'Customers appreciate the fact that there is no longer interference from the seat in front of you moving up and down throughout the flight,' Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson told The New York Times. Southwest may not have taken away that freedom from its passengers quite yet, but they are limiting their options as they designed new chairs that only allow them to go two inches back rather than the previously-standard three. Colorful and sleek: Southwest designed 'slimline' chairs that use thinner material and a sleeker design to take up less space . The 'slim line' chairs are constructed in a way, using lighter materials and a different design, that helps the company put more seats in the cabin. While passengers may not enjoy the change, company higher-ups are seeing the change as that simple design change equates to an additional $200million in annual revenue from tickets sold in those extra seats. Airlines are not the only ones causing problems by shrinking their seats, as part of the blame lies with the passengers themselves. The Centers for Disease Control reports that over the past 40 years Americans' waistlines have expanded by 2.5 inches and the average person is heavier by more than 20 pounds. Rather than make the seating space larger to accommodate that physical transformation, airlines are making their offerings smaller.","Southwest created seats using lighter materials and a sleeker design to take up less space .

Despite offering customers a 10 per cent store-wide discount at the weekend in an attempt to regain some of the loyalty lost during their data breach scandal, new survey results show Target is still struggling to weather what is being called its worst crisis in their 50-year history. Considered the nation's No. 2 retailer, Target has reached its lowest consumer perception point since at least 2007, according to polling site YouGov, dropping a whopping 45 points in brand popularity. The day after Target announced that hackers had somehow accessed information to an estimated 40 million customer credit and debit cards on December 20, it's 'Buzz Score' on YouGov dropped 35 points to -9. Then on Monday, the day after CEO Gregg Steinhafel’s 10 per cent off offer ended, Target fell even further to - 19. In one day, from last Thursday December 19 through Friday December 20, Target's consumer perception dropped further than either PlayStation or Citibank did in one week after their recent data breaches became public, according to YouGov. The total point drop is 45 . Empty: Target is struggling to regain its customers and reputation after an estimated 40 million people were affected by their card-hacking scandal from November 27 to the first week of December. The data breach was made public December 20 . Since the hacking crisis, Target has launched an aggressive public relations campaign to show how seriously they are handling the situation, including offering customers a 10 per cent discount last weekend . Leading up to the scandal announcement, Target's Buzz Score was 26. Their total point drop in the aftermath was 45. The lowest Buzz score Target has ever received was around 10 in 2007. The Justice Department is still investigating the credit hack, which is being called the second largest incident of its in U.S. history. The largest affected at least 47.5 million T.J. Maxx customers in the mid-2000s. The lack of answers around the Target data breach is the likely cause of the store's customer alienation. In order to ascertain a company's 'Buzz Score', YouGov surveys customers asking whether they have 'heard anything about the brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or word of mouth, that was positive or negative'. At least 15,000 people have been interview regarding Target since July 1, YouGov said. Target says that all members of staff are working to help resolve the date breach issue, however survey results say they have been dealt a major blow in brand popularity . As the chart shows, shoppers’ perception of Target dropped well below that of similar brands like Walmart, Kmart and Macy’s just before the last weekend of the holiday shopping season - a critical time for retailers. Customers affected by the Target breach complained that they had to cancel credit and debit cards just as they were rushing to buy holiday gifts. Millions of others faced bank-imposed limits on how much cash they could take out at ATMs or spend on their debit cards. It will take several weeks, at minimum, for Target to recover their reputation. In June 2011, it took four weeks for Citibank to bounce back in their following a data breach.

An elephant killed its keeper in a zoo 'because it was affected by the smell of paint', experts say. The animal, which was being kept in an enclosure at the zoo in Vietnam, attacked his long-term trainer. The zookeeper, Doan Huu Tai, was about to begin painting the cage of the nine-year-old elephant, Ka, Tuoi Tre News reports. Elephant: The trainer was killed by an elephant at the Dai Nam Tourist Centre (file picture) Ka grabbed Mr Tai with his trunk, smashed him against the wall of the cage and threw him into a water basin. The zookeeper later died from a brain injury. Mr Tai, 28, had worked with the two-tonne elephant for at least seven years. They were both at the Dai Nam Tourist Center in Thu Dau Mot City north of Ho Chi Minh City. Dr Pham Viet Lam, director of the Saigon Zoological and Botanic Gardens, said the smell of the paint Mr Tai brought into the cage may have irritated the animal and made it angry. He said elephants can be affected when they experience unfamiliar colours, sounds or smells. Trunks are very sensitive to smell and the paint could have made the elephant uncomfortable and caused him to attack his trainer, said Dr Vu Ngoc Thanh, a biology lecturer at Hanoi National University . In October, a 62-year-old zookeeper died after an Asian elephant called Patience charged at him in her enclosure as he fed her. John Phillip Bradford, elephant manager at Missouri's Dickerson Park Zoo, had been with two other keepers in the animal's barn at about 8.45am when the incident happened. It is not yet known what caused the 6,000lb elephant to attack her keeper, who had worked at the zoo for 30 years. However, the elephant had a history of aggression.","The zookeeper, Doan Huu Tai, was about to begin painting the cage .

With his studs up, Prince Harry does a good impression of Chelsea legend Ron ‘Chopper’ Harris with this ugly tackle. The challenge could have earned a red card if his boots had made contact with his opponent in a competitive game. But that didn’t stop him making other heavy-handed attempts to win the ball in a festive friendly – even if his brother William was on the receiving end. The two princes were playing on opposite sides in the now-traditional Christmas Eve fixture involving estate workers near the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. Studs up: Prince Harry lunges aggressively into a tackle during the charity Christmas football match . Steady on: Prince Harry slides in for a tackle on his brother The Duke of Cambridge during the match at Sandringham estate . Tired: The 29-year-old who, was playing on the opposing side to his brother William, looked worn out after recently returning from his 200-mile trek to the South Pole . While the banter was relatively . friendly, it was clear that the brothers were playing to win as they . clattered into each other on the rain-sodden pitch at Castle Rising. At . one stage, Harry, 29 – still bearded from his Antarctic charity trek – . made fun of an opponent’s corner kick. William, 31, jokingly pleaded . with the referee to issue a card, saying: ‘Give him yellow, give him . yellow – backchat.’ The . Duke of Cambridge, who was wearing a red and white striped shirt and . light blue Aston Villa socks in honour of his favourite team, was also seen . throwing himself into the game. Rugged: The prince was still sporting the beard he grew during his recent expedition to the South Pole as he joined villagers and estate workers for the match . Embrace: The two brothers hugged at the end of the game, which ended in a 2-2 draw . Post-match: The two princes congratulated teammates and opposition after the game . Eye on the ball: Prince William also got stuck into the annual fixture, and wore the socks from his beloved Aston Villa . With his thinning hair, onlookers said the 31-year-old looked like former England footballer Bobby Charlton. Army pilot Harry’s competitive streak saw him battle . hard to win the match for his team – with a  tackling style reminiscent . of Ron ‘Chopper’ Harris, renowned as one of the toughest defenders of . the 1960s and 1970s. When they went a goal down to William’s side . after ten minutes, the younger prince soon scored to put them level. Covered in mud, Harry’s team, in white tops, came from behind again in . the second half and the game eventually finished at 2-2. The princes then proved they were still the best of friends by hugging after the final whistle in the match between Sandringham estate workers and villagers from Castle Rising blew.

Ed Currie holds one of his world-record Carolina Reaper peppers by the stem, which looks like the tail of a scorpion. On the other end is the bumpy, oily, fire-engine red fruit with a punch of heat nearly as potent as most pepper sprays used by police. It's hot enough to leave even the most seasoned spicy food aficionado crimson-faced, flushed with sweat, trying not to lose his lunch. Last month, The Guinness Book of World Records decided Currie's peppers were the hottest on Earth, ending a more than four-year drive to prove no one grows a more scorching chili. The heat of Currie's peppers was certified by students at Winthrop University who test food as part of their undergraduate classes. Hot stuff: Ed Currie displays his Carolina Reaper peppers he claims are the hottest peppers in the world . But whether Currie's peppers are truly the world's hottest is a question that one scientist said can never be known. The heat of a pepper depends not just on the plant's genetics, but also where it is grown, said Paul Bosland, director of the Chile Pepper Institute at New Mexico State University. And the heat of a pepper is more about being macho than seasoning. 'You have to think of chili heat like salt. A little bit improves the flavor, but a lot ruins it,' Bosland said. Some ask Currie if the record should be given to the single hottest pepper tested instead of the mean taken over a whole batch. After all, Usain Bolt isn't considered the world's fastest man because of his average time over several races. But Currie shakes off those questions. 'What's the sense in calling something a record if it can't be replicated? People want to be able to say they ate the world's hottest pepper,' Currie said. The record is for the hottest batch of Currie's peppers that was tested, code name HP22B for 'Higher Power, Pot No. 22, Plant B.' Currie said he has peppers from other pots and other plants that have comparable heat. The science of hot peppers centers around chemical compounds called capsaicinoids. The higher concentration the hotter the pepper, said Cliff Calloway, the Winthrop University professor whose students tested Currie's peppers. Hot on the market: Currie sells his hot peppers at his store in Fort MIll, South Carolina . The heat of a pepper is measured in Scoville Heat Units. Zero is bland, and a regular jalapeno pepper registers around 5,000 on the Scoville scale. Currie's world record batch of Carolina Reapers comes in at 1,569,300 Scoville Heat Units, with an individual pepper measured at 2.2 million. Pepper spray weighs in at about 2 million Scoville Units. Pharmacist Wilbur Scoville devised the scale 100 years ago, taking a solution of sugar and water to dilute an extract made from the pepper. A scientist would then taste the solution and dilute it again and against until the heat was no longer detected. So the rating depended on a scientist's tongue, a technique that Calloway is glad is no longer necessary. 'I haven't tried Ed's peppers. I am afraid to,' Calloway said. #I bite into a jalapeno - that's too hot for me.' Now, scientists separate the capsaicinoids from the rest of the peppers and use liquid chromatography to detect the exact amount of the compounds. A formula then converts the readings into Scoville's old scale. The world record is nice, but it's . just part of Currie's grand plan. He's been interested in peppers all . his life, the hotter the better. Ever since he got the taste of a sweet . hot pepper from the Caribbean a decade ago, he has been determined to . breed the hottest pepper he can. He is also determined to build his . company, PuckerButt Pepper Company, into something that will let the . 50-year-old entrepreneur retire before his young kids grow up. The . peppers started as a hobby, grown in his Rock Hill backyard. The . business now spreads across a number of backyards and a couple dozen . acres in Chester County. As his business grew, Currie kept his job at a . bank because he promised his wife, whom he wooed a decade ago by making . her a fresh batch of salsa, he wouldn't leave the lucrative position . until they were out of debt. She released him from that vow in February. Currie . has about a dozen employees. Even with the publicity of the world . record, he still gets nervous about making payroll. He said the . attention has helped him move closer to the goal of making PuckerButt . self-sustaining. Proceed with caution: Ed holds up the hot peppers that make some people spasm or vomit . Currie's peppers aren't just about heat. He aims for sweetness, too. He makes sauces and mustards with names like 'Voodoo Prince Death Mamba,' 'Edible Lava' and 'I Dare You Stupit' with a goal to enhance the flavor of food. And the hot pepper market is expanding. In less than five years, the amount of hot peppers eaten by Americans has increased 8 percent, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics. Currie's world record has created quite a stir in the world of chiliheads, said Ted Barrus, a blogger from Astoria, Ore., who has developed a following among hot pepper fans by videotaping himself eating the hottest peppers in the world and posting the videos on YouTube under the name Ted The Fire Breathing Idiot. Barrus said Currie's world record is just the latest event in a series of pepper growers to top one another with hotter and hotter peppers. 'That's the biggest bragging rights there are. It is very, very competitive,' he said. The reason people love super-hot peppers isn't much different than any other thrill seekers. Barrus talks lovingly about trying the Carolina Reaper, even though the peppers usually send him into spasms of hiccups and vomiting. 'You only live once. This is safer than jumping out of an airplane,' he said. Barrus said Currie's news has other growers sending him peppers that seem hotter than the Carolina Reaper on his tongue, although they will await scientific testing. That's fine with Currie. He knew the record would be challenged quickly and has sent off what he thinks are even hotter batches to the students at Winthrop University to test.'Nobody is going to grow hotter peppers than Ed Currie,' he said.","Ed Currie has had the hottest pepper to ever be tested over the last 4 years granting his pepper the title of hottest in the world .

With its white spiderweb design and 18 rotors humming gently, it looks like it was plucked straight from a science fiction book. This is the world's first electric two-seater helicopter, which could soon be flying over your house after online investors raised £1 million in just three days. Instead of a traditional combustion engine, it uses an battery pack on the back of the aircraft to power the 18 rotors arranged on top. Scroll down for video . Sci-fi: With its 18 rotors and spiderweb pattern, the Volocopter looks like it was plucked from fiction . Eco-friendly: It is the world's first two-seater helicopter to be powered purely by electricity, and much quieter . Lift-off! The inventors celebrated last month as it made its maiden flight. Since then they have raised £1m . Technology: When completed the Volocopter will be able to fly up to 6,500ft weighing not more than 450kg . Flight of fancy: Although the maiden flight was unmanned, the inventors hope to get people on board soon . Its inventors say it will be the most environmentally-friendly helicopter ever created. They also claim it will be the world's safest because it is unlikely to crash if a rotor fails. The design is so unusual that authorities in Germany, where it is being developed, have had to invent a new class of aircraft for it to get a license to fly. When the Volocopter VC200 is completed, it will be able to fly at 6,500ft for up to an hour weighing a maximum of 450kg including crew and kit, about half the weight of a Nissan Micra. After the successful test flight last month, inventors Thomas Senkel, Alexander Zosel and Stephan Wolf put out . an online plea before Christmas for money from internet investors. Their 'crowdfunding' attempt on the website seedmatch.de was so successful it smashed all records in Germany - earning them 500,000 Euros in just two and a half hours. By the time they reached their total of 1.2 million Euros (£1m) in three days, nine hours and 52 minutes, they had been handed money by 750 different investors ranging from 250 to 10,000 Euros. Engineering: The team in Karlsruhe has taken several years and millions of Euros to advance the design this far . Success! The inventors sit inside their creation, with one wearing a t-shirt bearing the craft's odd design . Coming to Britain? Anyone with a pilot's license can fly the craft, which is being primed for mass production . Mr Zosel, the managing director of E-Volo, the firm behind the aircraft, said: 'There are already numerous requests for the Volocopter . from around the world. 'The money raised will now serve to . optimize the first prototype of the VC200 and, as part of the testing . scheme, conclude a comprehensive test flight program for this new . aviation category. 'After that, we will build a weight-optimized . prototype of the VC200 [to prepare for mass production]. 'With . multiple flights lasting several minutes reaching the nearly 22m [72ft] high . ceiling, including a number of smooth takeoffs and landings, the . Volocopter concept exceeded all expectations. 'The result of the first flight created a euphoria among the entire project team.' The idea has been several years in the planning and previously won a 2 million Euro (£1.7m) grant from Germany's federal ministry of economics and technology. Test flights were conducted in Karlsruhe, Germany, including of a 16-rotor prototype last year with room for just one brave pilot. Prototype: A test version of the helicopter last year had room for just one precariously-placed pilot . For the test version, the VC1, the pilot had to sit in the open air on top of a metal ball containing the batteries . Soaring success: The Volocopter's inventors celebrate after their prototype made its maiden flight . Weighing just 80kg including the batteries, it was so small that the helmet-wearing pilot had to sit in the open air between the blades strapped into a tiny chair. Anyone with a private pilot's licence in Germany will be able to fly the revolutionary aircraft once it hits the mass market. Its inventors claim it is also simpler to fly than a traditional helicopter, with just one joystick controlling almost every aspect of flight. The project has been handed a provisional airworthiness certificate and its inventors hope it will get the sign-off from aviation authorities in the near future. A statement by the firm said: 'The Volocopter is an absolutely novel aircraft which cannot be assigned to any existing aviation category. 'The greatest challenge after . technical realisation is to be able to place such an aircraft on the . market.'","Otherworldly design uses a battery pack instead of a combustion engine .

Our favourite new word at home is 'listicle'. In the real world it's used to refer to the lists of funny facts which seem to populate every website my kids love. Things like 'ten car parks that look like Cher', for example, or '14 kittens that dance like Wayne Sleep'. These so-called listicles have tickled us. Every day, we throw out a few family ones. One million reasons Mum thinks she is always right, as my husband is fond of muttering. Eleven red carpet dresses Henry, seven, wishes he'd worn before I stopped him cross-dressing. That kind of thing. So as New Year is prime listicle season, I've told the family I am compiling a personal listicle of things I will not be saying in 2014. Why? Because after a decade of parenting I am getting sick of the sound of my own voice nagging away like a stuck record repeating the same thing again and again. So, Team HobNob, you won't hear me say any of the following next year: 'Clean your teeth, brush your hair, wash your hands, eat your  broccoli, flush the loo, turn the computer off, turn the volume down and stop arguing.' Also banned will be: 'Leave her head alone!' This one is peculiar to my son, who loves to repeatedly sniff his toddler sister's hair, provoking the same reaction in her that I'd imagine you'd see if you woke a hibernating bear - violent rage. Whenever I say these things, they are either ignored or a  child proposes an alternative to which no fool would agree - for example, she will flush the chain if she can have a biscuit. The 'asked and answered' parenting theory is that once you've answered a child's question, you shouldn't have to answer it again . My New Year listicle is the first step in my 2014 resolution for Positive Parenting (stay with me, you may learn something) because I am getting ever more frustrated at being the one who has to say no all the time to endless ridiculous requests from my four fabulous children. I don't want to be 'Shouty Mum' any more. I want to be 'Fun Mum' (as the woman in the cold and flu advert says). And I think I have found a solution. A new book by U.S. parenting guru Amy McCready reckons there are just three words you need to use to stop yourself becoming a negotiating nag. Just three words to put an end to the relentless requests that occur on an hourly basis with children and teenagers. The magic words are: 'Asked  and answered.' When your child asks if they have to do their homework and you say yes, you shouldn't have to tell them again . And this, my friends, is how you use them according to the book: . Child/monster-in-a-hoodie (sorry, I mean teenager) asks irritating question to which I have already replied no. For example: 'Can I have ice cream for breakfast/wear a skirt so short my lower intestines will catch a chill?' Instead of saying no a second time, and then being asked the same question again and again until hell freezes over, you say: 'Asked and answered.' Your perplexed but determined child/teenager asks the same question again. You say: 'Have you asked that question before?' Child/teenager: 'Yes.' You: 'Do I look like the kind of mum who would change her mind since the last time you asked?' Child/teenager realises you are most definitely not the kind of mum who changes her mind. Again you say: 'Asked and answered.' If you like, you can draw a picture of the question and not speak at all, just point at the picture with 'asked and answered' written under it. Amy McCready's book about positive parenting aims to end a number of problem behaviours, and says it can spell the end to childish nagging . I like the sound of this. With this new tactic in my parenting toolbox I won't need any of the nags on my listicle. But I will wait until the New Year because over the festive period we have indulgent relatives to stay whose resolution won't be as strong as mine. Some of them are prone to agree to jelly and ice cream for breakfast (recognise anyone, Grandma?) so 'asked and answered' will be devalued. Everyone has to stick to the 'asked and answered' rule or it won't work. Mr Candy will need intensive training because his default reply to a question being asked 20 times is: 'Ask Mum.' He never wants to be bad cop and I suspect he wouldn't be much help in terrorist negotiation situations. If you want to come up with your own listicle, do let me know how the 'asked and answered' approach works for you. Particularly successful candidates might win the chance to take on the ultimate challenge - my stubborn two-year-old Mabel.

A Roman Catholic church official who has been jailed for more than a year for his handling of priest sex-abuse complaints had his conviction reversed and was ordered released on Thursday. In dismissing the landmark criminal case, a three-judge Superior Court panel unanimously rejected prosecutors' arguments that Monsignor William Lynn, the first U.S. church official ever charged or convicted for the handling of clergy-abuse complaints, supervised the welfare of any particular child. 'He's been in prison 18 months for a crime he didn't commit and couldn't commit under the law,' said his attorney, Thomas Bergstrom. 'It's incredible what happened to this man.' Monsignor William Lynn had a conviction against him for the handling of clergy-abuse complaints overturned in Philadelphia on Thursday . Lynn, 62, is serving a three- to six-year prison sentence after his child-endangerment conviction last year. His lawyers will try to get him released as early as Thursday from the state prison in Waymart. Prosecutors had argued at trial that Lynn reassigned predators to new parishes in Philadelphia while he was the archdiocese's secretary for clergy from 1992 to 2004. Lynn's conviction stems from the case of one priest, Edward Avery, found to have abused a child in 1998 after such a transfer. Lynn's attorneys have long contended the state's child-endangerment law at the time applied only to parents and caregivers, not supervisors like Lynn. Common Pleas Judge M. Teresa Sarmina rejected their argument and allowed the case to move forward, but the Superior Court panel reversed her decision. Prosecutors could ask the full Superior Court to rehear the case. Monsignor Lynn entering the courthouse last year before he was convicted of child endangerment . Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said he strongly disagreed with the decision. ""While we are deciding what our next course of action will be, we most likely will be appealing,"" he said. Lynn's supporters believe he was made a scapegoat for the church's sins, including two cardinals who were never charged. After Lynn's trial, Kansas City Bishop Robert Finn was convicted of a misdemeanor for failing to report a priest with child pornography.","Monsignor William Lynn oversaw hundreds of priests in the Philadelphia Archdiocese .

Never one to miss a trick, the nation’s politicians have jumped on the bandwagon and are using social media to send their messages of seasonal cheer along with some frankly ridiculous photos of their growing broods. This Christmas has seen some impressively awful examples of these cheery seasonal photos with the Romneys and the Pelosis seemingly competing to see who can fit the most relatives into a photo.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent a seasonal note to her supporters this year plus a message explaining that the photo was taken at a family gathering to celebrate the California Democrat's 50th wedding anniversary with husband Paul. The Romney’s Christmas photo includes even more people and includes Mitt, Ann and almost all of their 22 grandchildren. It looks like it would have been a very noisy and chaotic photo shoot to try and organize. Keeping things a bit more orderly are the Bush family. George W has posted a photo of him, wife Laura, daughters Jenna and Barbra, plus Jenna’s husband Henry Chase Hayer and their daughter Mila.

Millions of people are marooned at home today as Britain faces near shutdown amid another barrage of stormy weather. Families have battened down the hatches, seeking shelter as 109mph winds batter the country, and landslides and flooding cause chaos in many parts of the country. On what is the traditionally the first normal trading day after Christmas, workers have been forced to take advantage of the torrential rain and gusty winds, extending their festive break into the weekend. The normally bustling streets of London at rush hour this morning, were instead deserted as millions of people chose to stay at home in the midst of another storm sweeping across the country . Hundreds of thousands of workers have taken advantage of the torrential rain and gale force winds, opting to stay at home rather than brave the adverse weather conditions . London's Embankment at rush hour resembled the the normal scene in the early hours of the morning, with no traffic or pedestrians lining the normally busy route . Underground stations in London were left deserted, train stations normally brimming with commuters, and roads usually full of queuing traffic lay empty as 8am hit and the rush hour got underway. The normal weekday mayhem gave way to empty Tube carriages and train platforms, resembling scenes from the early hours of the morning rather than peak travel time. The High Street is expected to feel the impact, as hundreds of thousands of bargain hunters opt to search for the best deals online rather than brave the storm of the post-Christmas sales. Analysts predict £2.97billion will be spent on the High Street and online today. That figure would be a record for retail spending in the UK, according to the British Retail Consortium and the Centre for Retail Research, which showed £.28billion was made on December 21 and 27 last year. Martin Ashfield, Head of Commercial Property Claims at AXA said the severe weather will have 'unfortunate' consequences for smaller businesses in particular. He said with many businesses closed for the festive period, it is difficult to predict the total cost of the damage. He said: 'Severe weather invariably has an unfortunate detrimental impact on business - and small businesses which do not have the same capacity on the balance sheet as their larger counterparts to absorb weather-related shocks often find themselves at the sharp end of these events. Westminster underground station was virtually empty during this morning's rush hour, as workers took the opportunity to extend their Christmas break . Southeastern Trains, which operates the rail network in Kent, cancelled all its services this morning into London Victoria, where a lone passenger is pictured above . Waterloo Station in London was among those free from the usual commuter chaos today as hundreds of rail services in and out of the capital were affected by the severe weather . 'Having adequate property insurance . is only part of the issue as many smaller companies often under-estimate . how long it takes to get back to trading after a serious flood - that . is something that business interruption insurance will take care of.‎ . 'There . is never a good time to be flooded but when many businesses have . increased stock levels to cater for the January retail sales and extra . demand over the festive period, the impact can be much higher. 'However, . with many businesses closed for the holiday period, it is too early to . be able to assess the extent of the damage at this stage.' Torrential . downpours and gales sweeping in from the Atlantic have wrought havoc on . the country's rail network with many train operators cancelling all . services.

The fresh band of stormy weather is heading east across the UK, with northern England and Wales expected to be among the worst hit areas, the Met Office said. Southeastern Trains, which operates the network in Kent, was forced to cancel all services this morning. Most other operators are warning passengers to expect severe delays as speed restrictions are imposed. Regent's Street, one of the most popular shopping destinations for people living and visiting the capital, is partially closed after high winds dislodged Christmas decorations hanging high above the heads of the post-Christmas sales bargain hunters. At London's Victoria station the usually bustling barriers were cordoned off today as the majority of train stations into the rail hub were cancelled in the storm .

Through his court-appointed attorney Larry Whitney, left, Metsker pleaded not guilty in the rape and strangulation of nine-year-old Reann Murphy who was found dead in a trash bin at the trailer park where they were neighbors . A grand jury had indicted the 24-year-old Metsker on charges of aggravated murder, kidnapping and rape. He is being held on $1 million bond. Authorities previously said the death penalty would be available as punishment if Metsker is convicted of murder. Metsker was the last person seen with nine-year-old Reann Murphy at their trailer park in Smithville, southwest of Akron, authorities said. A caller identifying himself as Metsker reported Reann missing in a 911 call. Her body was found December 15 after a frantic search by neighbors and law enforcement. Metsker was arrested later that day. The prosecutor said she was likely killed at Metsker's mobile home between 5.30pm and 7.30pm on December 14. On that day, the girl had been at home with her mother's live-in boyfriend while her mother was at work, authorities said.

He said he last saw her the day after Thanksgiving. Investigators with the Wayne County sheriff's office earlier described Metsker as a family friend and neighbor. Capt.

A toddler required emergency surgery and was lucky not to lose an eye after she fell onto railings during a supervised playtime at nursery. Three-year-old Michaela Eaton was left scarred for life when she slipped and cracked her head on metal railings during a game of hide and seek at Castle Vale Nursery in Birmingham, West Midlands. Her furious parents claim the nursery failed to carry out a written report regarding the safety of the railings and have since issued a formal health and safety report themselves. Michaela’s father, Mark Eaton, 39, said: ‘There needs to be something done to stop this happening again to another child, and I couldn’t believe when I asked to see the results of a health and safety report and was told there wasn’t any written report.’ Mr Eaton and wife Edwina, 43, rushed to the nursery after they were telephoned and told Michaela had cut her head. Mr Eaton said: ‘Michaela was sat in the office with a compress on her head. It was only when the paramedics arrived that we saw the true extent of her injury.’ Michaela was rushed to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where she went straight into theatre for emergency surgery on her face. Plastic surgeons spent over an hour stitching up a deep gash just millimetres from her eye, which doctors warn will probably leave a large scar. Mr Eaton said: ‘Her injury was so deep she was lucky she didn’t lose an eye. It was just horrific and she was crying her eyes out.’ Supervised: A spokesperson for Castle Vale Nursery said the playground was fully staffed at the time . He added: ‘When my wife saw her injury . she almost fainted and I just couldn’t believe it… They say it was . supervised play, but I don’t understand why there are railings so close . to where children are playing.’ Since the incident, which happened in . November, staff at Castle Vale Nursery . have apologised and carried out a health and safety inspection, claiming . the railing ‘did not constitute a significant hazard.’ But . when Mr Eaton asked to see the health and safety report, he was told by . staff at the Health and Safety Executive there wasn’t one, and a . spokesperson from the council-run nursery said the information was given . verbally to the deputy-head teacher. Disbelief: Michaela's father Mark Eaton (right) says the nursery failed to issue a health and safety report . Mr . Eaton said: ‘When I found out the nursery hadn’t even written a report, . I couldn’t believe it. I was told the findings were that the railings . were a normal school fence and that this information was given verbally . to a teacher.’ Horrific: Michaela suffered a deep wound just millimetres above her right eye . He has now written and submitted a health and safety report himself. Mr Eaton said: ‘I just want the issue to . be taken seriously. Michaela was lucky not to be blinded- another child . who falls over might not have the same luck.’ He added: ‘All they would have to do would is plant some bushes in front of the railings, which would prevent the children from playing near them. It is surely much better for children to perhaps have a scratch from a bush, rather than a horrific injury involving the railings.’ Mr Eaton says staff at the nursery are hoping Michaela will return, but the family are not so sure. He said: ‘We need to wait for the doctors to check over Michaela’s wound in February before she can go back to nursery. She really enjoyed it there, it is just a shame her accident doesn’t seem to be taken seriously.’ A spokesperson from Castle Vale Nursery, said: ‘We are very sorry that Michaela had such a nasty accident in the school playground while playing hide and seek with a friend…The playground was fully supervised at the time of the accident.’ The spokesperson added: ‘Following the accident there was a health and safety inspection and the officer who conducted the inspection was satisfied the railing did not constitute a significant hazard…This information was given verbally to the deputy head teacher.’","Michaela Eaton required emergency surgery for the horrific wound .

"By . John Hall . PUBLISHED: . 07:24 EST, 27 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:48 EST, 27 December 2013 . A farmer has claimed his chickens lay more eggs when he plays them soothing operatic music. Steve Ledsham, 64, says egg production soared when he started playing the hits of Andrew Lloyd Webber within earshot of his 24 hens while building a barn at his farm in Wirral, Merseyside. When Mr Ledsham went to collect eggs shortly afterwards, he noticed there were around double the number he had expected to find. Good egg: Farmer Steve Ledsham says his hens started to lay more once he began playing them the hits of Andrew Lloyd Webber . He says the dramatic increase, which saw the hens raise their output from four to eight eggs a week each, is all down to his taste for the classic songs of musical theatre. Mr Ledsham, who has worked on the farm for 20 years, said: ‘We were building a barn at the time so we always had music playing in the background.’ He added: ‘While building it we noticed the hens were laying more eggs and we put two and two together and realised it was because of the music.’ Mr Ledsham claims his hens only . appreciate certain kinds of music however, adding that he doubts ‘modern . chart rubbish’ by the likes of One Direction or Miley Cyrus would have . had such a positive impact. He . said: ‘I'm not really a fan of new music and I don't think the chickens . will be either so I'll stick to the traditional stuff.’ Cultured hens: The farmer claims his chickens wouldn't appreciate 'modern chart rubbish' such as One Direction and Miley Cyrus . Mr Ledsham, who won The Soil Association's best organic farm shop in 2005, believes the main reason the hens are producing more eggs is because the music makes them more relaxed and happy. Dramatic: The chickens are said to be fans of The Phantom of the Opera. A 2004 film adaption of the musical starred Gerard Butler (pictured) ‘Happy animals produce better goods so by playing some soothing opera classics they are able to relax a lot more than they usually would,’ he says. Mr Ledsham isn’t the first farmer to claim exposure to classical music has a positive effect on his chickens. In 2008 Charles Bourns - a farmer in Gloucester - claimed his 70,000 chickens reacted positively to the soothing strains of Classic FM. He told Farmers Weekly that, despite experimenting with pop music, he found Classic FM worked best as it has fewer dramatic tempo changes and there was less talking between songs. In 2011 a farm in Hong Kong’s New Territories conducted an experiment in which 20,000 chickens were played a mixture of classical, rap, pop and jazz. The results suggested that the hens were not particularly bothered by the different genres and would simply lay more eggs as long as there was a consistent rhythm drowning out any stress-inducing background noise. The theory has been backed by experts who say music can have a calming influence on animals. John Widdowson, Vice Chairman of the . Free Range Egg Producers Association, said: ‘A lot of people play music . to chickens as a way of helping them to relax… It's a good idea because . it blocks out any background noises which are prone to upset them.’ He added: ‘But I don't know why they would prefer a specific type of music, they must be very cultured chickens.’ Top technique: The hens produce more eggs because the music relaxes them . Mr Ledsham is happy in role as an egg pioneer, and hopes more farmers follow his example and begin experimenting with music. He says: ‘I'm thrilled that it has worked and I'm pretty sure a few more farmers across the country are doing it now as well’.","Farmer Steve Ledsham, 64, says egg production doubled when he started playing soothing operatic music .

A Jack Russell has been reunited with its owners after it survived eight days trapped down a rabbit hole by drinking the moisture gathering on rocks. Eight-year-old Minnie was on a woodland walk with her owners Simon and Leela Humphreys near St Cleer in Cornwall when she disappeared into the bushes chasing rabbits. After an eight-day search proved fruitless, the couple received a phone call from a neighbour who said she could hear whimpering coming from beneath the ground in the area where Minnie vanished. Mr and Mrs Humphreys raced to woodland with shovels and dug for over an hour before realising they would need to call in professional help as Minnie was trapped too far down for them to rescue on their own. Thirteen firefighters subsequently attended the scene, taking over an hour to rescue Minnie from the narrow tunnel. Mr Humphreys, a 56-year-old ecologist, said: ‘She will chase rabbits now and again but will come back after about 10 minutes later but she didn’t this time’. He added: ‘Many of our friends and family joined in to try and look for her but we couldn’t find her anywhere… But then last Monday we got a call from our friend Fay who said she could hear whimpering’. Missing: A neighbour in St Cleer, Cornwall heard her whimpering under the ground . Alive: Other than appearing skinny, smelly and slightly panicked, Minnie escaped her ordeal unscathed . Mr Humphreys said Minnie appeared skinny, smelly and slightly panicked following her eight-day ordeal, but after a bath and some food she didn’t require any further medical attention. Minnie is believed to have survived by drinking the water that gathered on the rocks around her. Unseasonably mild weather and a lack of ground frost are thought to have aided her survival. Speaking of his reunion with Minnie, .

A pet dog saved the life of his owner's dying cat after he discovered the lost feline, which had a detached pelvis after being hit by a car, stuck in brambles. Kevin and Louise Errington thought their beloved cat Stewart had wandered off when he hadn’t been seen for more than 24 hours. But when their golden retriever, Toby, wouldn’t stop barking at a bramble bush in their back garden in Staffordshire, they discovered the black-and white cat badly injured, curled up under the bush. Stewart's pelvis had been separated from his spine and he had also suffered a broken leg . Realising their pet appeared to have been hit by a car, paramedic Kevin and veterinary nurse Louise managed to free their pet with seceteurs before rushing him to vets for emergency surgery. Vets agreed that if nine-year-old Toby hadn’t gone hunting for the cat, Stewart would almost certainly have died. Kevin, 57, said: 'Stewart and Toby are the best of friends. We were starting to worry when we hadn’t seen Stewart for a day, but we weren’t too concerned. But Toby knew something was wrong. 'We let Toby out into the garden and he ran to the bottom of the garden and was barking and barking at this bramble bush. He kept looking over at us and barking, but he wouldn’t leave the bush. Vets said that if nine-year-old Toby hadn¿t gone hunting for the cat, Stewart would almost certainly have died . 'Eventually we went over and that’s when we found Stewart. It looked like he had been hit by a car, and had somehow dragged himself about 50 metres from the road back to our garden - even though we found out later that his pelvis had been completely detached from his spine. 'Toby is an absolute hero. When we found Stuart, he was down in the brambles, freezing cold and only minutes from death. 'Toby wouldn’t leave his side. They really are the best of friends. Toby, wouldn¿t stop barking at a bramble bush, alerting his owners to Stewart . 'Stewart will sleep with Toby in his basket. Normally cats and dogs don’t get on but these two will even rub noses.' Louise, 51, adopted Stewart after he was brought into the vet surgery she worked at - he had been discovered dumped in a wheely bin with plastic lodged in his throat. And as soon as he was taken back to the couple’s home, he and Toby became firm friends. Five-year-old Stewart is believed to have been hit by a car. His pelvis had been separated from his spine and he had also suffered a broken leg. He had been missing for 24 hours when Toby found him cowering in the bush in the back garden of their home. Within minutes of the discovery, Stewart was under the knife at Endon’s Willow Veterinary Clinic. The lucky feline is still suffering from significant nerve damage in his right leg but for now he is making a good recovery. Paramedic Kevin, 57, said: 'I’ve seen some bad things in my job but I don’t think some humans could have endured that level of pain and injuries. 'Toby was definitely the hero of the day.'

Nearly half of the people who don’t vote say they can’t be bothered to turn up at the polls because they think MPs are ‘just on the take’. 46 per cent of non-voters agreed with the statement just a week after former Labour MP Denis MacShane was jailed for fraud. The survey also found that 34 per cent of 18 to 25 year-olds said that anger or boredom best described how they felt about the current system. And 64 per cent said that politicians don't keep their promises. However, the vast majority of potential voters believe that the decisions politicians make are important, and claim to discuss politics with their friends. Despite many admitting that they would not vote, only two per cent claimed it was because of the inconvenience of registering. The poll, which was conducted on behalf of The Guardian, found that anger is particularly prevalent in Labour voters, northerners and those who have turned to newer parties like UKIP. Lead by Nigel Farage, the party made significant gains in local elections this year, and two-thirds of UKIP supporters polled said that politics and politicians made them more angry than anything else. Speaking to The Guardian, Conservative MP Chloe Smith, who became a minister at 31, said: 'We have to demonstrate what politics is for, why a young person's individual act in voting matters.' 41 per cent of people who can't be bothered to vote say that anger is the main reason for their decision . They also agreed that this is a thought that would discourage them from turning out on polling day. Mike Smithson, who runs the Political Betting website, claimed that the poll spells good news for UKIP, with little comfort for the most established parties. He said: 'I think this is good news for UKIP and hard work for everyone else.'The coalition changed everything. Voter apathy could spell good news for UKIP's Nigel Farage . 'The Conservatives are angry because they can't do what they would like to do, the Lib Dems are angry because they haven't been able to do anything. 'The coalition has made things a lot, lot worse and has affected how people feel about politics generally.'","34 per cent of 18 to 25 year-olds said they were bored or angry with politics .

Comedy: Red Nose Day attracts celebrities including Homeland actor Damian Lewis and Dawn French . Comic Relief has revealed that it is selling its shares in tobacco, arms and alcohol companies following an expose of its unethical investment practices. In a dramatic U-turn following weeks of refusal to change what it does with its funds, the charity has agreed to withdraw millions of pounds from controversial ‘booze, bombs and fags’ funds while an ‘urgent review’ of its policies is carried out. The temporary block comes as staff try to deal with the huge public backlash caused by the revelations that Comic Relief pumps donations into the companies even as it backs projects to help victims of war, alcohol abuse and smoking-related illnesses. Despite initially defending the policy on the grounds that ethical investments would generate a smaller return, Comic Relief has now agreed to submit itself to an eight-week inquiry into its investment policies. The embarrassing turnaround was announced in a low-key press release on its website on Monday. Its chair Tim Davie – who also heads the BBC’s commercial arm BBC Worldwide – said: ‘As a charity which depends on public trust, it’s absolutely right that we take this opportunity to examine our investment policy thoroughly in view of the concerns which have been raised.’ Comic Relief’s trustees said  the review panel would consist of two independent members, Mr Davie and three Comic Relief trustees. The meetings will be attended by Four Weddings and a Funeral director Richard Curtis – who  co-founded the charity with comedian Lenny Henry in 1985 – and its £131,000-a-year chief executive Kevin Cahill. The statement read: ‘Until the review has been concluded, the trustees have decided to withdraw Comic Relief funds from the sections of the investment portfolio which have caused concern, and this process is underway. Funny business: The charity co-founded by Lenny Henry, centre, has celebrated its 25th anniversary . ‘Comic Relief is committed to finding a solution that allows it to continue to deliver the greatest benefit to the poor and vulnerable people it supports.’ In its initial response to the scandal – exposed by the BBC’s Panorama programme earlier this month – Comic Relief took a very different tone. At the time, a spokesman said: ‘Because the range of issues we support is so broad, ethical screening would significantly limit our ability to invest as well as seriously increase financial risk. ‘We do not invest directly in any individual company. We believe  this approach has delivered the greatest benefits to the most vulnerable people.’ But after the programme prompted a huge online backlash from members of the public who felt their donations had been misused, Mr Cahill appeared to backtrack and promised he would ‘do the right thing’. This year’s Red Nose Day raised more than £100million after an eight-hour show on BBC1 and BBC2, fronted by presenters including Lenny Henry, Russell Brand, Jonathan Ross and featuring skits by Henry’s ex-wife Dawn French and Homeland actor Damian Lewis. Funny for money: Comic Relief happens every two years and raises more than £100 million each time . Arms: The investments included the weapons manufacturer BAE Systems, pictured . But some of the charity’s own stars – including comics Frankie Boyle and Al Murray – have since distanced themselves from its activities, trading jokes about Comic Relief’s connection to companies such as weapons manufacturer BAE Systems and British American Tobacco. According to Comic Relief’s accounts from 2007 to 2009, it placed millions in ‘blue-chip’ City funds that in turn invested in the firms, including £2.7million in three tobacco firms in 2009. It is currently sitting on a £100million fund donated by the public despite promising to hand ‘every pound’ straight to good causes in its annual broadcasts.","Scandal exposed by BBC's Panorama programme earlier this month .

Now Simon Cowell has thrown the same insult back at the Education Secretary, claiming he failed to see he was making a ‘positive’ statement about giving people without qualifications a chance. The music mogul said his shows such as X Factor demonstrate that you can be successful without getting good grades or going to university, and called Mr Gove’s response ‘unbelievable’. Trading blows: Music mogul Simon Cowell (left) has claimed Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) failed to see he was making a 'positive' statement about giving people without qualifications a chance . He said: ‘He didn’t bother to call, he didn’t want to hear my side of the story and, stupidly, he didn’t see the positive side of what I was trying to say which is that not everybody who leaves school is going to get great qualifications, or maybe they just don’t have that kind of brain. ‘But, that doesn’t mean that they should be ruled out, or not given a chance... so, if anything, I thought he was irresponsible, because he was basically saying, if you’re not qualified we’re not going to back you, and it’s like, how crazy are you for saying that?’ The row began last month when Cowell, 54, who is worth more than £200million from his record labels and hit shows such as X Factor, said he was ‘useless’ at school but claimed it did not matter. He attended private Dover College in Kent and then Windsor Technical College and reportedly left with two ‘O’ Levels. His father helped him find a post in the mail room at the record company EMI, where he went on to sign successful bands such as Five and Westlife before launching the X factor in 2004 with his own production company SyCo. In an interview with a US radio station he said: ‘I didn’t work hard when I was at school. I left at 16 and I didn’t have any qualifications. I was useless. The secret is to be useless at school and then get lucky.’ Praise: Cowell (right) said Susan Boyle (left) is an example of someone who has been given a chance, having had 'doors slammed in their faces' The Education Secretary responded angrily, saying Cowell should use his fame to champion hard work at school ‘not rubbish it’. He said: ‘This is an irresponsible and stupid thing to say. ‘Teachers strive every day to ensure children understand the importance of learning, hard work and discipline. Simon Cowell’s comments undermine their efforts. 'Stupidly, he didn’t see the positive side of what I was trying to say which is that not everybody who leaves school is going to get great qualifications, or maybe they just don’t have that kind of brain' Simon Cowell . ‘The truth is that only a tiny fraction of people get lucky. For everybody else, it’s all about hard work and that starts with hard work at school. Celebrities like Mr Cowell should encourage education, not rubbish it.’ Programmes such as X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent have been attacked by politicians for leading a generation of children to believe fame and fortune comes easily. But Cowell, who is shortly expecting his first child with girlfriend Lauren Silverman, said yesterday that he had been ‘kidding around’ and ‘not trying to make some kind of political statement.’ Speaking on London radio station LBC 97.3, he added: ‘I don’t run a company where I hire people based on their qualifications, or have they gone to university. We hire people from the age of 16 up, 17, whatever it is, who want to work hard and want to make a career for themselves.’ He added: ‘Look, I never made these shows to make statements, but I think the one thing I can say about shows like the X Factor and Got Talent, is that even though people knock them, it is actually giving people a shot who’ve had doors slammed in their faces. Criticism: Programmes such as X Factor (pictured) and Britain's Got Talent have been attacked by politicians for leading a generation of children to believe fame and fortune comes easily . ‘And, Susan Boyle I think is a good example of that. I mean the idea that Susan Boyle at 47 could have got a record deal, the odds would have been 10billion-to-one she wouldn’t. So, the show was the only platform for her, and she’s gone on to sell something like 30million records. 'The truth is that only a tiny fraction of people get lucky. For everybody else, it’s all about hard work and that starts with hard work at school. Celebrities like Mr Cowell should encourage education, not rubbish it' Education Secretary Michael Gove . ‘I’ve always been someone who slightly backs the underdog a little bit, that goes back to that point I just made about qualifications, and on the show, I kind of like those moments when someone like that gets supported by the public and goes on to do well.’ Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the Commons Education Select Committee, said after Cowell’s original comments: ‘For every Simon Cowell and brilliant entrepreneur like Richard Branson who leave school without qualifications, there are hundreds or thousands of young people who are not achieving good English and Maths GSCEs who are condemning themselves to a life of low aspirations and low wages. ‘X Factor has already sent the wrong message to many young people that it is all too easy to get rich quick on the back of couple of hours’ worth of performance. ‘The reality of life is that careers take years of graft and that includes having a strong education, particularly for those from deprived backgrounds.’","Cowell says X Factor proves you can be successful without good grades .

Prized: Gangs will seek out England fans, because they believe they will be carrying the most money on them, as well as expensive items such as smartphones and cameras . Sao Paulo, where the team will play its opening match against Uruguay on June 19, is already one of the most dangerous cities on the planet. More than 100 violent murders are carried out every month, and this September alone there were nearly 11,000 armed robberies. More than 60,000 street robberies have taken place in the city, which has a population of 27million people, this year, and more than 360 people have been killed during hold-ups. And according to the Daily Star, the gangs are threatening to up the number of attacks during the World Cup, when 600,000 tourists are expected to visit the city. Stark: An aerial view of one of Sao Paulo's slums - home to many criminal gangs . The boss of one gang, operating out of a shack just yards from opening ceremony venue the Corinthians Arena, said he expected to make around 100,000 reals, worth roughly £25,000, during the tournament. 'Every England fan who can afford to travel to Brazil is rich, in my view. I'm poor, so they'll all be richer than me,' he told the newspaper, brandishing a .38 calibre pistol.

The man, who called himself Joao, said the tourists would also carry valuable items, such as cameras and phones, with them - unlike locals. He said that all criminals would need to do to find their victims is to look for those wearing England replica shirts, and that although fans would be safe once inside the stadium, they would have to use public transport or taxis to get there. 'I'm not interested in targeting the footballers, and we don't do kidnappings. But there are other groups who are planning these things,' said the 35-year-old from the Vida Loka gang. He added that there were criminals operating in the city who would 'do anything' to get money.","Thugs to target England supporters as they will be carrying money .

Banned: Serial killer Rose West is said to be 'fuming' after prison bosses banned inmates from using the showers after their gym sessions . Murderer Rose West is said to be 'fuming' after being banned from using the showers in the prison gym. Bosses at HMP Low Newton, a 336-capacity maximum security jail in Durham, outlawed inmates taking showers following workouts after a string of thefts. The ban was put in place earlier this year after a number of items of clothing and belongings were pinched while female inmates were washing. Several prisoners - including West - have complained that the ban leaves them 'feeling filthy' after a sweaty workout and they are demanding the rule is overturned. West has become an 'avid' gym user in the last year since piling on the pounds while inside. The 60-year-old, who was jailed for life in 1995 for 10 murders, is a size 20 and is thought to weigh around 15 stone. The mother-of-eight works as a tea lady for prison wardens, earning Â£16-a-week. But West - along with other inmates - is fuming that they leave the gym 'feeling filthy' and sweaty and are demanding to have the showers in the gym switched back on. Fellow inmates Maz Cullerton and Tracey Cutting have both complained about the ban on showers, saying it is 'disgusting'. The two prisoners, who jointly signed the letter on behalf of the 336 inmates at the prison, wrote: 'We feel the need to write in and express our disgust at the way the gymnasium is being run here. 'The most disgusting fact about the gym is that we women are no longer allowed to use the gym's shower facilities. Thefts: The ban was imposed by bosses at HMP Low Newton, a maximum security jail near Durham, earlier this year after a spate of thefts . 'They were stopped when I made a complaint that my prison-issue gym tee-shirt going missing. 'We feel we are being punished collectively for being assertive. 'Women who attend gym courses are expected to train and then go to afternoon jobs and activities feeling filthy - it is totally degrading.' She added: 'Yes, we have sinks in our rooms but these are not exactly satisfactory. 'Why should we have to strip-wash in sinks in the 21st century? 'Now the showers that were built specifically for inmates are being used by prison staff only. Killers: Rose West, pictured with her husband Fred, who committed suicide while on remand charged with 12 murders . 'Do we have a right to a shower after taking part in physical gym activity? 'Is this the only jail that fails to promote and provide good health and hygiene?' According to a source, West is a 'regular user' of the gym and has 'lent her support' to the campaign to get the shower ban overturned. The source said, however, there was no specific Prison Service Instruction (PSI) which requires jails to provide showers in jail gyms. He said: 'The PSI 2011-058 which covers physical education for prisoners does not mention shower provision.' A spokesperson for HMP Low Newton said that prisoners were 'returned' to their cells after workouts in the gym. She said: 'Prisoners are returned to their living areas after exercise.' She also said there was 'ample time' for them to wash outside the confines of the gym before starting work. West was convicted, by a unanimous jury, of the murders of 10 young women at Winchester Crown Court in November 1995. The crimes for which she was convicted took place largely between April 1973 and August 1979. She murdered Charmaine West, the daughter of her husband's previous wife Rena, in June 1971. The eight-year-old's body was buried at the West's former home, 25 Midland Road in Gloucester. One of the body's discovered at the couple's Cromwell Street home, dubbed the House of Horrors, was their daughter Heather. The 16-year-old was killed by her father after being abused by Rose and raped by Fred. She was buried under the patio at the house, which has since been torn down and paved over creating a public walkway. Demolished: The House of Horrors, the West's home in Cromwell Street, Gloucester was demolished following Rose's conviction and Fred's suicide. The couple's daughter Heather was found buried under the patio . In August 1992 Fred West was arrested after being accused of raping his 13-year-old daughter. Rose was arrested for child cruelty at the same time. But the case against the couple collapsed when the young girl refused to testify against her parents. The investigation brought to light the absence of Heather and sparked an inquiry into her disappearance. The couple had given various explanations for Heather's disappearance, telling one person she had gone to Wales with a lesbian and another that the teenager had left home after assaulting one of her siblings. Fred West hanged himself while he was on remand at Birmingham's Winson Green Prison, charged with 12 murders.

David Cameron has warned newspapers to sign up to his plan for state-backed regulation of the Press or risk a crackdown from a less 'liberal' government in the future. The Prime Minister said if the Press continues to make the 'mistake' of refusing to do so, a future 'illiberal' government may impose tougher restrictions. His stance is in stark contrast to Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who recently indicated nothing would happen if the Press refused to sign. Stark contrast: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and Culture Secretary Maria Miller (right) do not seem to have been singing from the same hymn sheet on Press regulation . Most national newspapers have refused to sign up to the politicians' new system of Press regulation underpinned by Royal Charter, over fears it would bring to an end 300 years of Press freedom. They have put forward their own proposal for a tough new regulator, independent of politicians, which they say meets Lord Leveson's recommendations. Speaking to The Spectator magazine, Mr Cameron said he wanted to see newspapers be 'compliant' with the politicians' charter. 'I believe there's a great opportunity here to put this difficult and painful issue to bed,' he said. 'If the Press set up their regulator I hope, in time, they will make that regulator compliant with – to then seek recognition under – the charter recognition body. 'If that then happens, we'll have in place a system that I think will settle this issue because we would have achieved what Leveson wanted which is independent self-regulation by the Press.'

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: 'I think this proposed Royal Charter is indefensible and it's bang out of order to try to defend it on the basis a future government might do something even more indefensible. 'The Press in this country hasn't been forced to publish under licence for centuries and it would be a massive black mark against this Government if they push ahead with this folly.' Kirsty Hughes, the chief executive of Index on Censorship, said: 'The Royal Charter already steps over a red line – the threat that it could be replaced by something even worse doesn't make it acceptable.

Steve Hodgson quit his Met Police post in disgrace after using the expression 'n***** in the woodpile' in front of shocked colleagues . A Metropolitan Police finance boss has quit in  disgrace after using the expression 'n***** in the woodpile' in front of shocked colleagues. Steve Hodgson is said to have been thrown out of the meeting he was chairing after making the offensive comment. Mr Hodgson, who was hired by the force in February to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from its budget, left the premises immediately. He is thought to have been overseeing a finance discussion between staff from the force's finance, human resources and IT departments at the time. The management consultant, who has also worked for the Department of Health, British Airways and the Royal Mail, where he built a reputation for ruthless cost cutting, later apologised and resigned from his six-figure post. But he then issued a statement through the force to say he did not recall making the comment, but could not be sure that he did not  make it either. Yesterday it emerged that he was still being paid by the Metropolitan Police more than a fortnight later while a successor was appointed. A spokesman for the force refused to say in what context the expression he used was made. The phrase dates back to the 19th century and refers to escaped slaves in American's Deep South who tried to evade recapture by hiding in places such as a stack of logs. In a statement, the Yard said: 'We can confirm Steve Hodgson has taken the decision to resign from his role as interim director of shared support services following allegations that an ill-judged comment was made by Steve in a recent meeting. 'Steve is clear he does not recall making the comment but nor can he be certain enough he didn't say it to categorically deny it. 'In the circumstances, he has decided the most appropriate option is to apologise for any offence he may have caused and to resign. Steve Hodgson, who previously worked for the Royal Mail, is said to have uttered the racist phrase while managing a discussion on cost-cutting . 'Steve left the Metropolitan Police Service premises immediately but will continue to be employed for a short period to allow for a full handover of his work to take place.' The consultant, who describes himself as a 'strong leader of transformational change programmes', was recruited to trim 30 per cent from the finance, HR, operational support and IT departments and the Met's extensive property portfolio. Educated at Thames Valley  University, where he gained a post-graduate diploma in training  management and human resource management, he has a background in aeronautics. After completing an HND in aerospace studies at the RAF College in 1990, he worked as HR director for BAE Systems before moving to Royal Mail in 2003 where he saved £50million from its HR budget. He then worked as a director of shared services at the Prison Service before leaving in 2008 to work as a consultant on short-term management projects for the Department of Health, BA, the British Airports Authority, Cheshire Police and a steel company before taking on the role at the Met. The country's biggest police force has struggled since 1999 to shake off the tag of 'institutional racism' attached to it in the Macpherson Report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, has declared himself an 'implacable enemy' of  racism but allegations of racist behaviour continue. Last month it emerged that the force has paid out almost £666,000 in compensation to settle racism claims against officers and staff since 2009. Most of the payouts were made in out-of-court settlements. The figures were disclosed by the office of London Mayor Boris Johnson at the request of Andrew Dismore, a Labour member of the London Assembly who said they illustrate the force 'still has a problem with racism'.","Steve Hodgson was a Met Police interim director for 11 months .

Britain is now the largest donor to an international fund to help poor countries, putting in £2.8billion - more than the US, Japan and Germany. The fund run by the World Bank raised nearly £32billion at a meeting of governments in Moscow last week, with the UK giving around 10 per cent of that. Ministers also offered up an additional £500million in low-interest loans to the International Development Association, which raises money from richer countries, with 46 donating, to the world’s 82 poorest nations for health, education and economic projects. Pledge: The contribution is part of David Cameron's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid . The money is part of David Cameron’s controversial pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid, which Britain will fulfil next year after vast increases in spending by the Department for International Development (DFID). It comes as other departments have had their budgets cut back. In March, George Osborne said the aid budget would hit £11.2billion this year - more than the Home Office budget. The aid target was a key plank of Mr Cameron’s strategy to ‘decontaminate’ the Tories’ uncaring image at the last election, but he has come under pressure to drop it in the wake of the financial crisis. Right-wing Tories such as Peter Bone have attacked increases in the aid budget pegged to economic growth as ‘absurd’. He said earlier this month: ‘The aid budget is going to go up, not because there is more need for it or more poverty in the world, but because we have got better economic growth – it is a nonsense. This is why these arbitrary targets are such a mistake. 'Absurd': Right-wing Tories such as Peter Bone, pictured, have said that foreign aid should not increase while the national debt remains high . ‘We are still borrowing billions a month but, because growth has gone up, we are going to borrow even more so that we can give it away.’ As a top contributor, the UK will get added influence over the policies it funds and how the cash is spent, according to the World Bank. Britain was also the top donor to this fund during in 2007 and was in the top four donors in 2010. The latest aid package was negotiated by government officials, who offered a contribution even larger than that of the United States, the next biggest donor which put in £2.4billion - although the U.S. Treasury said Washington would seek to increase its contribution when next year’s federal budget is finalised. Japan, which was third, would not provide specific figures, while Germany which was in fourth place pledged £1billion in grants, conditional on the approval of its parliament. A DFID spokesperson said: ‘The UK has secured important reforms to the way the World Bank delivers aid, including greater emphasis on improving value for money, and increased focus on conflict countries. ‘Thanks to this investment 200 million children will receive life-saving vaccines, it will also provide health services for 65 million people and access to clean water for 32 million people.’","World Bank fund raised £32billion - and we gave almost 10 per cent .

Emperor penguins maintain the tight huddle that protects them from the harsh conditions of an Antarctic winter with stop-and-go movements like cars in a traffic jam, a new study has shown. German researchers said an individual penguin only needs to move a mere two centimetres in any direction for its huddling neighbour to react and also make a small step to stay close to it. These tiny movements then flow through the entire group - which includes thousands of penguins - like a wave. Scroll down for videos . Emperor penguins maintain the tight huddle that protects them from the harsh conditions of an Antarctic winter with stop-and-go movements like cars in a traffic jam . The Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 48inches (122cm) in height and weighing anywhere from 49 to 99lbs (22 to 45 kg). Like all penguins the Emperor is flightless, but has a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Its diet consists primarily of fish, but can also include crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. In hunting, the species can remain submerged for up to 18 minutes, diving to a depth of 1,755 ft (535m). It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured hemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions. The Emperor is the only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, . It treks 31–75 miles (50–120 km) over the ice to breeding colonies which may include thousands of individuals. Their lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50 years of age. The stop-and-go motion plays a vital role in keeping the huddle as dense as possible to protect the penguins from the cold, while the wave also helps smaller huddles merge into larger ones. Researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), in Bremerhaven, Germany, used a mathematical model to recreate the positions, movements and interactions of individual penguins in a huddle. In a previous study, the same group of researchers studied time-lapse videos and showed that instead of remaining static, penguins in a huddle actually move every 30 to 60 seconds, causing surrounding penguins to move with them. Daniel Zitterbart, co-author of the . study, which is published in the Institute of Physics and German . Physical Society’s New Journal of Physics, said: ‘Our previous study . showed how penguins use travelling waves to allow movement in a densely . packed huddle, but we had no explanation as to how these waves propagate . and how they are triggered.’ German researchers said an individual penguin only needs to move a mere two centimetres in any direction for its huddling neighbour to react and also make a small step to stay close to it. This is a screenshot of the animation showing the stop-and-go movement of the penguins . To investigate this, the researchers used a mathematical model, which has previously been used to study traffic jams and compared the results with an analysis of video recordings of a real-life penguin huddle. Unlike a traffic jam, the researchers found that the waves of movements in a penguin huddle can originate from any single penguin and can propagate in any direction as soon as a sufficient gap, known as a ‘threshold distance’ develops between two penguins. To cope with the harsh conditions, the male penguins form dense huddles, often consisting of thousands of individuals, to maintain their body temperatures . This threshold distance was estimated to be around two cm, which is twice the thickness of a penguin’s compressive feather layer, suggesting the penguins touch each other only slightly when standing in a huddle without compressing the feather layer so they maximise huddle density without compromising their own insulation and warmth. ‘We were really surprised that a travelling wave can be triggered by any penguin in a huddle, rather than penguins on the outside trying to push in,’ said Dr Zitterbart. ‘We also found it amazing how two waves, if triggered shortly after each other, merged instead of passing one another, making sure the huddle remains compact.’ The stop-and-go motion of the penguins plays a vital role in keeping the huddle as dense as possible to protect the penguins from the cold, while the wave (illustrated in a computer model) also helps smaller huddles merge into larger ones . The Emperor penguin is the only vertebrate species that breeds during the severe conditions of the Antarctic winter. At this time of year temperatures can get as low as -50°C and winds can reach speeds of up to 200 kmp. To cope with the harsh conditions, the male penguins form dense huddles, often consisting of thousands of individuals, to maintain their body temperatures. Unlike other species of penguin, the male emperors are solely responsible for incubating their single egg during the winter, covering it in an abdominal pouch above their feet while the female returns to sea to feed.

She taught him of the ‘simplicity of intention and directness of purpose’ and soon made his reputation with a house in Godalming, Surrey. The mansion became known for balancing the roof’s sweep with high-buttressed chimneys and counteracting small doorways with long strips of windows. Various country houses followed before he began looking at larger civil projects in 1910, and advised on the planning of New Delhi. His garden-city pattern revolved around hexagons separated by wide avenues with lines of trees. Sir Edwin, who was knighted in 1918, later helped design a number of war memorials.","The 12,500 sq ft mansion in Thakeham, West Sussex, was built in 1902 and features huge fireplaces .

Professionals are . using their financial muscle to buy homes - even second homes - close to over-subscribed schools . Cunning and underhand tactics used by wealthy parents to get their children into top state schools have been laid bare in a report. Professionals are using their financial muscle to buy homes – even second homes – near over-subscribed schools, while others are resorting to breaking the law by setting up fake addresses in desirable catchment areas. The Parent Power survey commissioned by education charity the Sutton Trust found a third of professional parents deliberately moved to an area with good schools, while one in five moved to the catchment area of a specific school. Astonishingly one in 20 could afford to buy a second home just to use the address when applying. This was more than double the two per cent among parents in general. Six per cent – double the average – admitted using a relative’s address on application forms. And one in ten said they had started going to church to get their child into a faith school compared with one in 16 among parents in general. And one in 20 - five per cent - bought a second home to use the address when applying for a place at a specific school. This was more than double the two per cent among parents in general. The release of the survey comes two days after the Chief Inspector of Schools attracted criticism by saying grammar schools are ‘stuffed full of middle-class kids’. Sir Michael Wilshaw dismissed the argument they help social mobility on the grounds that better-off families are forcing out poorer pupils by snapping up properties in the area or paying tutors to help their children through the 11-plus entry test. Supporters say it is the lack of grammar schools in England - just 164 remain - that is creating the intense competition for places. They argue opening more would deliver the benefits grammar schools achieved before Labour politicians started their demise. The Parent Power report, commissioned by the Sutton Trust education charity and involving 1,173 parents of five to 16-year-olds, found a third of professional parents deliberately moved to an area with good schools and one in five to the catchment area of a specific school. Around two-fifths are ‘hyperchoosers’ who use five sources of information, such as Ofsted reports and exam results, when picking a school. Among low-income families the figure is just 13 per cent. Professional parents were also more likely to pay for weekly music, drama or sporting lessons and activities outside school. Over two-thirds pay for extra-curricular activities, compared to around half of working class parents and less than a third on the lowest incomes. No darling, that's an A-flat: Professional parents were also more likely to pay for weekly music, drama or sporting lessons and activities outside school, found the survey by the education charity The Sutton Trust . The Sutton Trust called for reforms including random allocation of school places through ballots and free transport for poor pupils to give them access to a choice of schools. Chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: ‘This research suggests that those with money actively choose to live near good schools, employ tutors and ensure their children have extra lessons and enrichment activities that are often too expensive for other families to afford. ‘This provides a significant advantage in school choice and in developing the cultural capital that is so important to social mobility and later success. ‘Education is about more than what happens at school and providing a more level playing field in school choice and out-of-school activities is essential if every child is to achieve his or her potential.’ However, report co-author Professor Becky Francis, of King’s College London, added: ‘Our findings also demonstrate the extent to which some working class parents are enacting “informed choice” and policymakers may also learn from their practices.’","A third of well-off parents have moved home to an new area for a school .

If you're planning to move house, you may wish to set your sights on the lush Welsh countryside rather than the bustling streets of London. House prices in many parts of Britain's capital have soared by more than 40 per cent - well above their previous peaks in 2007. Meanwhile, asking prices across areas of Wales, the Midlands and the north have plummeted by at least 20 per cent, according to a new study. Divergence: House prices in parts of London have soared by more than 40 per cent, while asking prices across areas of Wales, the Midlands and the north have plummeted by at least 20 per cent, according to a new study . The shocking figures have been revealed in a report on the 'great housing divide' by the Smith Institute think tank. They show that the cost of living in London's most sought-after hotspots has shot up by 43 per cent since the peak of November 2007 - with even the least desirable parts of the capital rising in price by more than 20 per cent. Property prices in the City of Westminster have jumped by 43.2 per cent to £863,256, while the average house in Kensington and Chelsea now costs a staggering £1,171,320 (an increase of 42.8 per cent). However, in the same six-year period, prices have fallen by a whopping 47.7 per in Blaenau Gwent in Wales, according to The Observer.

Concern: Business Secretary Vince Cable, left, has warned there is 'still a danger of house prices getting out of control', while Labour's Sadiq Khan, right, has unveiled plans to help Londoners get on the housing ladder . It adds that investors continue to pump more money into already pricey areas as the returns are greater for developers. This means that the country's less prosperous regions are left behind. 'What . we have witnessed over the past six years is the growth of two distinct . and divergent housing markets: a London-centric property market where . house prices have recovered and in some cases soared, and the rest of . England and Wales where prices are flat and transactions are low,' says . Smith Institute director Paul Hackett in the report. He adds that the divergence is 'deep-rooted' in nature - with jobs and growth concentrated in London and the south-east. The report comes amid concerns that soaring rents in these regions have resulted in a sudden rise in homelessness. Last month, Business Secretary Vince Cable warned there is ‘clearly still a danger of house prices getting out of control’. And on Friday, the Bank of England's chief economist Spencer Dale said the housing market could turn ‘from lukewarm to scalding hot in a few economic seconds’. This weekend, Labour's shadow minister for London, Sadiq Khan, has unveiled plans to help people who are trying to get on the capital's housing ladder.","House prices in London have risen by more than 40 per cent, says study .

The term Cistercian is the Latin name for the village of Cîteaux, near Dijon in eastern France. It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded Cîteaux Abbey in 1098, with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict.

It could also be used to heal skin and muscle, according to scientists. Researchers say they were able to grow new knee cartilage during initial tests. They believe it could also treat cancers, osteoarthritis and traumatic injury. Peter Choong, director of orthaedics at St Vincent's, told The Times: 'This type of treatment may be suitable for repairing acutely damaged bone and cartilage, for example, from sporting or motor vehicle injuries.' Doctors hope to use the pen to sketch replacement bone exactly for a patient's particular needs unlike implants which don't work exactly how human tissue does. Researchers say they were able to grow new knee cartilage during initial tests . The cell material is contained within a gel made up of 'bio-polymer' like the seaweed extract alginate which is inside the pen. The damaged part of bone is then filled with the ink gel. An ultra-violet light is then used to solidify the ink which provides protection for the cells while they are built up layer by layer. Once cells begin to develop they turn into nerves, muscle and bone.","Made by University of Wollongong and St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne .

Angry shoppers yesterday accused stores of ripping them off with bogus discounts as millions of people flocked to the Boxing Day sales. High street stores enjoyed record takings, with more than £3billion in total thought to have gone through the tills and footfall up on last year. But within hours, consumers vented their anger on Twitter after discovering some items were originally cheaper before the Boxing Day sales began. Angry shoppers yesterday accused stores of ripping them off with bogus discounts as millions of people flocked to the Boxing Day sales . Consumer groups warned shoppers to be on their guard against such ‘pseudo-sales’, in which prices are inflated just before they are discounted so that the deal looks better than it actually is. Yesterday there were concerns shoppers may have fallen victim to such tactics after furious messages appeared on Twitter from shoppers who claimed they had been ripped off. Chelsea Corcoran wrote: ‘The shoes I wanted are more expensive in the sale than they were originally, what??’ Eleanor Hampton wrote: ‘Confused how some trainers are now more expensive in the sale than before Xmas’. Helena Emmanuel added: ‘Went on the  @ZARA website and a cardigan I saw two days ago in the shop is now more expensive on the sales page. B***** scam.’ High Street stores had record sales this Boxing Day though some shoppers feel they could have been duped into thinking items were cheaper than they ever had been . Meanwhile, Keith from Belfast took a photograph of an apparently dubious ‘sale’ item in the outdoor clothing store Trespass. A huge red sale label claimed the . men’s trousers were reduced from £76.99 to £38.49, while the original . tag showed the usual price was apparently just £34.99. He wrote: ‘Either @trespass don’t know how a sale works, or they’re trying to cheat people. Check the different prices.’ Meanwhile . City worker Colin Jäger, from Hampshire, wrote: ‘@Homebase_uk I’m not . impressed how you increased the prices of what I wanted to buy by 28% . just before your 20% sale.’ ‘It now costs more!!! ‘Disgraceful practice of putting up prices just before announcing your 20% sale – what a con!!’. A spokeswoman for Homebase said: 'Homebase has genuine offers and we fully adhere to the law surrounding pricing and promotion, taking into account pricing guidance. In doing this we work closely with Trading Standards. 'We update our pricing frequently to ensure that we offer customers the best deals in what is a highly complex and competitive trading environment.' Consumer group Which? has urged shoppers . to be vigilant of such tactics and warned them to ‘know their shopping . rights for the Boxing Day sales’. Thousands queued to be first through the doors at Selfridges in London on Boxing Day . Under Trading Standards rules, pre-sale prices should be the last price at which goods were offered –and the goods should have been at that price for 28 consecutive days in the previous six months. Which? has previously attacked supermarkets for pulling a similar stunt. Some stores were found to inflate prices for just a few days, before promoting their products as being half-price or better for weeks afterwards. The consumer group said chains were exploiting loopholes in fair-trading legislation to advertise offers on items such as fruit and wine ‘that might mislead you into thinking you are getting an extra-special bargain when you are not’. Yesterday Guy Anker, managing editor . of MoneySavingExpert.com urged customers to be careful when shopping in . the Boxing Day sales to ensure the discounts advertised were genuine. He . said: ‘We know that prices are being manipulated in some stores, which . is disingenuous. Shops put the price up a few days before they put the . goods in the sale, which dilutes the true value of the sale. It is easy . to get seduced by labels offering 50 per cent off or three for two. What . is more important is whether it is good value. Though record sales were taken, this year marked the first year there were more online shoppers than those on the High Street . ‘Just because it is in the sale it does not automatically mean you are getting the best price.’ Yesterday, retailers were celebrating bumper sales. Selfridges said online sales figures for Christmas Day were double last year’s, but in a sign that shoppers have not yet deserted the high street, 120,000 people visited its Oxford Street store yesterday. Manchester’s Trafford Centre said it believed it was the biggest Boxing Day sale in its history,  while in London, 1.4million shoppers spent an estimated £50 million in the West End. Elsewhere, fights reportedly broke out between shoppers keen to snap up the best deals. Twitter user Kopsend wrote: ‘Punch-up in Next in Ipswich. People are going mad’, while  Peter Foulkes said: ‘Next sale is manic – a woman started a fight with a guy over a £6 T-shirt’. Georgia Welsh wrote: ‘Fight in River Island sale because someone pushed in.’ Overwhelmed shoppers took to Twitter to describe fights breaking out in stores like River Island and Next . Many shoppers admitted snapping up the discounted designer goods so they could sell them online. Student Richie Ling, 21, who emerged from Harvey Nichols, in Leeds, said: ‘I have spent over £2,000 so far today. ‘I’ve bought three Gucci handbags and four Gucci wallets. Some of them will be gifts for my family, the rest I’ll be putting straight on eBay. ‘I got almost 50 per cent off some of the items so it could potentially be a good earner – the presents might even pay for themselves.’ None of the shops mentioned in the complaints were available for comment last night.","Shoppers accused stores of advertising bogus discounts .

THE PRESIDENT: This is a season for millions of Americans to be together with family, to continue long-held holiday traditions, and to show our gratitude to those we love. And along the way, some of us might even watch a little basketball or eat some Christmas cookies, too. THE FIRST LADY: Here at the White House, over the past few weeks, we’ve had about 70,000 people from all across the country come visit us and look at our holiday decorations. This year’s theme was 'Gather Around: Stories of the Season.' And in every room of the house, we tried to tell a story about who we are as Americans and how we celebrate the holidays together. And we made certain to highlight some of the most powerful stories we know – the stories of our outstanding troops, veterans, and military families and their service and sacrifice for our country. THE PRESIDENT: Our extraordinary men and women in uniform are serving so that the rest of us can enjoy the blessings we cherish during the holidays. But that means many of our troops are far from home and far from family. They’re spending some extra time on the phone with their loved ones back home. Or they’re setting up video chats so they can watch as the presents are opened. So today, we want all of our troops to know that you’re in our thoughts and prayers this holiday season. And here’s the good news: For many of our troops and newest veterans, this might be the first time in years that they’ve been with their families on Christmas. In fact, with the Iraq war over and the transition in Afghanistan, fewer of our men and women in uniform are deployed in harm’s way than at any time in the last decade. THE FIRST LADY: And that’s something we all can be thankful for. And with more and more of our troops back here at home, now it’s our turn to serve – it’s our turn to step up and show our gratitude for the military families who have given us so much. And that’s why Jill Biden and I started our Joining Forces initiative – to rally all Americans to support our military families in ways large and small. And again and again, we have been overwhelmed by the response we’ve gotten as folks from across the country have found new ways to give back to these families through their schools, businesses, and houses of worship. THE PRESIDENT: That’s the same spirit of giving that connects all of us during the holidays. So many people all across the country are helping out at soup kitchens, buying gifts for children in need, or organizing food or clothing drives for their neighbors. For families like ours, that service is a chance to celebrate the birth of Christ and live out what He taught us – to love our neighbors as we would ourselves; to feed the hungry and look after the sick; to be our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper. And for all of us as Americans, regardless of our faith, those are values that can drive us to be better parents and friends, better neighbors and better citizens. THE FIRST LADY: So as we look to the New Year, let’s pledge ourselves to living out those values by reaching out and lifting up those in our communities who could use a hand up. THE PRESIDENT: So Merry Christmas, everyone. And from the two of us, as well as Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo… . THE FIRST LADY: And Sunny, the newest Obama. THE PRESIDENT: We wish you all a blessed and safe holiday season. THE FIRST LADY: Happy holidays everybody, and God bless.","The President says the values Jesus taught can spur Americans of all faiths to be better parents, friends, neighbors and citizens .

They had saved for months and spent hours building a playhouse as the ultimate Christmas gift for their severely disabled son. But as Fiona and Wesley Ratcliff got ready to unveil the special present to seven-year-old Harvey on Christmas morning, they were devastated to find it had been burgled and set on fire. The couple had paid £500 for the wooden shed, creating a ‘sensory playhouse’ inside for their little boy, complete with lasers, disco lights, rope lights and a digital radio. The Ratcliffs had painted inside the shed, put flooring down and put lights inside before it was set alight . Harvey Ratcliff's parents hoped he would be able to use the room for the first time on Christmas Day . It took two weeks for the summer house to be turned into a play area for Harvey . With the help of family and friends, they had also laid a padded floor and painted it sky blue, the colour of Harvey’s beloved Manchester City. Yesterday Mr Ratcliff, 32, a support worker, said their Christmas had been ruined by ‘disgusting and cowardly’ robbers. ‘Harvey doesn’t really understand what’s happened but the rest of us are devastated,’ he said. ‘I can’t put into words how I feel about the people who have done this. We didn’t have a Christmas Day. ‘Later in the evening we sat and opened a few presents but our hearts weren’t in it.’ Harvey is autistic and suffers from Phelan-McDermid syndrome, a genetic brain disorder which means he has a variety of physical and mental problems, including difficulties with learning, memory and he does not recognise danger. Police are now investigating to see if they can track down whoever started the fire . Arsonists destroyed a shed that had been converted into a sensory room for Christmas . A guinea pig hutch next to the summer house had also been set alight, but the two guinea pigs escaped unharmed . Mrs Ratcliff, 34, a part-time shop assistant, added: ‘Sometimes he forgets skills he’s learned and there are mornings when he wakes up and cannot remember how to walk.’ At such times the little boy is confined to a wheelchair. ‘The playhouse was going to be his own space, somewhere safe where he could do his own thing,’ she said. Mr Ratcliff added: ‘So many people – family and friends – helped out putting this together for Harvey. The thieves have taken the lights and the digital radio and the floor is fire damaged.’ The couple, who live in Wythenshawe, Manchester, and also have a nine-month-old girl, Addison, found their guinea pig hutch was also torched but the animals were unharmed. Mrs Ratcliff added: ‘It’s not millions but we’ve all worked really hard. The one good thing is that Harvey hasn’t seen it.’ Detective Inspector Jane Curran, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘Whoever did this has no morals whatsoever.’ Last night, however, there was happy news for the family as a local entrepreneur offered to cover the cost of building Harvey a new playhouse. Lawrence Jones, of IT firm UKFast, who was moved by the story which had spread on Twitter, wrote: ‘We have builders at the ready. Christmas is about helping.’","Harvey Ratcliff's parents hoped he could use it for the first time yesterday .

Doctors have become so casual about their work attire that patients struggle to identify their position at a hospital . Unless they return to a more traditional uniform, they risk ‘eroding’ the patients’ trust in their competence, a senior consultant has warned. Medical staff in white coats and ties have become a rare sight since they were banned by the NHS in 2007, restricting the wearing of the classic attire to private practices. Dress to impress: Unless they dress in proper uniforms, doctors risk losing the respect of patients as they struggle to identify their position at a hospital . Following a decision by the Department . of Health, doctors were ordered to remove ties, watches, coats and . shirts and remain ‘bare below the elbow’ in order to make it easier to . wash their hands and prevent spreading bacteria. ‘I hear that patients complain that . they do not know who the doctor is: no tie, no white coat, no jacket and . no presence,’ Stephanie Dancer, consultant microbiologist at Hairmyres . hospital, Lanarkshire writes in the British Medical Journal. ‘Untidiness erodes the image of . doctors as responsible and competent.’ ‘[Smartness] gives confidence to . patients who might be facing life or death decisions.’ Dr Dancer writes that the 2007 ban has . been seen as a ‘green light’ for doctors to dress casual and adds that . there is no evidence that wearing a white coat helps spread infection. Scruffy versus smart: Casually dressed Dr House, played by Hugh Laurie, is surrounded by his properly attired colleagues in the popular US television series . However the Department of Health stands firm in their ban of white coats. ‘NHS staff should wear short-sleeved . tops and not wear white coats during patient activity – being “bare . below the elbow” makes it easier for staff to wash their hands and lower . arms regularly,’ a spokesperson told The Times. ‘However, NHS staff should also dress in a way which inspires public and patient confidence. Dr Dancer argues the opposite, saying . that casual attire may have the opposite effect as ‘street clothes’ may . not be washed regularly enough, compared to a white hospital coat. ‘It could be argued that ditching the . white coat and tie for hygiene purposes has had the converse effect, in . that the informal attire now gracing our wards has encouraged a less . robust view of infection control.’","The ban on white coats for medical staff is confusing NHS patients .

Executives at A&E, the TV network behind Duck Dynasty, have admitted that they could have done more to dampen the hysteria surrounding Phil Robertson’s anti-gay remarks by immediately taking the hit reality show off the air for two weeks during the holiday break. The show has been immersed in controversy since homophobic quotes made by Robertson likening homosexuality to bestiality in the January 2014 issue of GQ Magazine became public last Wednesday. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy the network sought to distance itself from Robertson by suspending him indefinitely, and saying 'his personal views in no way reflect those of A&E'. Executives at A&E have admitted that they could have done more to dampen the hysteria surrounding Phil Robertson's anti-gay remarks by immediately taking the hit reality show off the air for two weeks . The matter then escalated after Republican politicians and figures, such as former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, spoke out citing Robertson’s right to free speech. Supporters of the show also utilized social media to campaign for Robertson to be instated. A source at the network told RadarOnline that the pro-Phil campaign social media campaigns had ‘taken on a life of their own, and it’s an absolute disaster for A&E.’ ‘Network bosses now recognize they should have just taken the show off the air for two weeks, since reruns were just airing anyway. The fallout wouldn’t have been strong and everyone could have just moved on.’ The source said the future of the hit show now depend on the two sides reaching a compromise. Bowing to pressure? A&E is set to rake in mountains of ad revenue as the network decides to air 11-hour Duck Dynasty marathon in spite of star Phil Robertson's anti-gay tirade . ‘Now, it’s a stand-off between the family and the network, who is going to blink first? There is no way Phil is going to apologize for his comments because he doesn’t think what he said is hateful or prejudice, it’s his religious beliefs,’ the source said. ‘The network is hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and a solution that is suitable for both parties can be reached. A&E isn’t going to walk away from Duck Dynasty, they can’t afford to do it. It’s just a matter of getting both sides to agree on how to move forward,’ the insider added. In the meantime, the network appears to have decided to capitalize on wave of publicity surrounding their number one show and on Christmas Day the network will air a super marathon of Duck Dynasty episodes. From Wednesday afternoon and stretching on for over 11 hours, viewers can watch Phil Robertson and his Louisiana clan stroke their beards, bicker with their wives and of course hunt for ducks. The decision will come as a slap in the face to those who supported the network's decision to suspend Robertson after anti-gay and racially insensitive remarks he made to GQ magazine - and years before in a 2010 sermon - made national headlines. Phil Robertson (pictured second left) is also on record making racially insensitive remarks suggesting that blacks didn't need civil rights reform in order to be happy . Anti-gay rantings: Phil Robertson speaking at Berean Bible Church in Pennsylvania in February of 2010 in which he fervently attacked gay people as sinners . Those who support the decision say A&E is just giving fans what they want - more of one of the most popular reality shows ever. 'I think, honestly, it’s A&E trying to play both sides of the coin,' celebrity blogger Cate Meighan told Fox News. 'They’ve come out and not supported Phil’s statements… however they’re also looking at the backlash from the fans, and they have a huge amount of backlash from the fans.' Robertson, the patriarch of the Louisiana clan on the reality show about hunting, fishing and domestic squabbles, was put on indefinite hiatus by A&E last week for his remarks to GQ magazine characterizing homosexuality as sinful behavior. The network has previously said it was disappointed after reading Robertson's remarks, which it added were his personal views and did not reflect those of the network. Civil rights groups GLAAD criticized the comments, but the 67-year-old Robertson also found supporters among Republican politicians and figures such as former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Sarah Palin, pictured with the Duck Dynasty cast while on her book tour in Louisiana. The former governor and her daughter, Bristol, have defended Robertson . The IStandWithPhil.com website, run by the organization Faith Driven Consumer, is petitioning A&E to reinstate Robertson and formally apologize to his family and his fans for removing him from future filming. It has collected more than 202,868 signatures since Friday, storming past its goal of 200,000. A Facebook page called 'Boycott A&E Until Phil Robertson Is Put Back on Duck Dynasty' has garnered more than 1.7 million likes and another called 'Boycott A&E and Support Phil Robertson' has more than 15,000 likes. A petition on Change.org titled 'A&E Network: Bring Phil Robertson back!' has more than 116,600 signers. The future of the popular series, . which is scheduled to begin its previously taped fifth season on Jan. 15, is up in the air following Robertson's indefinite suspension and his . family hinted that they would not participate without him. ‘We . have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a . family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch . at the helm,' the family said in a statement last Thursday. The . standoff between the Robertson family and A&E has put big money in . the balance as the impasse also threatens a vast array of 'Duck Dynasty' licensed merchandise that has brought in some $400 million, according . to Forbes magazine. Duck . Dynasty brand apparel and products, including camouflage bed sheets and . reclining furniture, are sold at retailers such as Target and Walmart. And some say it's that lucrative popularity that makes it nearly impossible for A&E to turn its back in the show.

It . averages about eight million viewers per episode and its Christmas . special was most-watched non-sports cable program on U.S. television . last week. 'It is . really a money thing,' Meighan said. 'Unfortunately people are . secondary...At the end of every single thing that we see it’s about the . money and the advertising.'

Saying Grace depicts a crowded restaurant with a grandmother and grandson bowed in prayer at their table. Another Rockwell painting, The Gossips, sold today for just under $8.5 million, while a third, Walking to Church, fetched a little more than $3.2 million. For nearly two decades, all three had been on loan at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., which has the world's largest collection of original Rockwell art located in the artist's hometown. Rockwell was paid $3,500 for Saying Grace. It appeared on the cover of the magazine's Thanksgiving issue in 1951 and was voted Post readers' favorite cover in a 1955 poll. The idea for the illustration came from a reader who saw a Mennonite family praying in a restaurant. Rockwell's son, Jarvis, was among the models the artist used for the drawing. Norman Rockwell's masterpiece The Gossips (pictured) also sold today in New York, for for just under $8.5 million . The illustrator, who created his first cover for the Post in 1916, is celebrated for his reflections of small-town America and portraits of famous figures. Rockwell, who was from New York, spent 47 years at the magazine and produced 321 covers. He died in 1978. The Gossips, which was a cover illustration for the March 6, 1948, issue, depicts a montage of the artist's neighbors, wife Mary and Rockwell himself finger-wagging and yammering on the phone. Walking to Church appeared on the cover of the April 4, 1953, issue and shows a family dressed in their Sunday best walking along a city street. Rockwell based it on a painting by Johann Vermeer. The trio, along with four other Rockwell works, were being sold by the family of Kenneth Stuart, Rockwell's longtime art director at the magazine. The sale comes years after a legal fight among Stuart's three sons. Rockwell and Stuart worked together at the magazine for 18 years. Laurie Norton Moffatt, director at the Rockwell museum, has expressed hope that the three Rockwells will eventually be returned. 'We cared for them like children... We hope they come back some day. We believe that's where they belong,' she said.","The painting, Saying Grace, had a pre-sale estimate of $15m to $20m .

The president had every reason to smile as he received a much warmer welcome in his home state than he did the last time he took his family to a basketball game back in November. Then he had been greeted with boos as the family had sat down to watch Oregon State take on the University of Maryland, but in Hawaii the president is treated very much like a returning hero. The Obamas drew a standing ovation and loud cheers as they walked in to the small arena at the University of Hawaii. Fans took pictures while press photographers and videographers crowded an entrance to take pictures. Throughout the game, some fans ignored the action on the floor and watched the president instead.

The arena beefed up security because of the president, screening players and cheerleaders and their belongings with metal detectors in the hours before the tournament tipped off.

The president has no public events scheduled during his vacation, which is expected to last through January 5. In previous years, frequent golf outings have accompanied trips to local restaurants and other island outings. A few weeks of low-key rest and relaxation would be a welcome change of pace for Obama, who reflected on a high-stakes year of brinkmanship and health care woes as he packed his bags for Hawaii. 'The end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,' Obama said Friday. 'I'm sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.'

The year before, a showdown over payroll tax cuts forced him to delay the start of his Hawaii hiatus. In 2010, it was congressional wrangling over repeal of the ban on gays in the military and other issues that delayed the trip. And in 2009, Senate deliberations over Obama's signature health care law meant that Honolulu had to wait another few days. Conditions seem ripe this year for a few weeks of interrupted family time.

Britain will be the fastest growing economy of any major European nation next year, experts predict. In a boost for Chancellor George Osborne, leading accountancy firm PwC said the UK economy is likely to grow by 2-3percent, outstripping Eurozone rivals. But in a sign of coalition tensions over the recovery, Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable warned that a 'raging housing boom' is under way in London and the South East. Tension: In a boost for George Osborne (left), leading accountancy form PwC said the UK economy is likely to grow by 2-3percent, although Vince Cable (right) has warned of a housing boom in London and the South East . He called on Mr Osborne to rethink the Treasury's Help to Buy scheme, which has been blamed by some for fuelling further demand, driving prices higher. The economy is tipped to rise above its pre-recession levels for the first time in the final three months of 2014. The deficit is also forecast to fall below £100bn in 2014/15, for the first time since before the downturn. Richard Boxshall, an economist at PwC, said: 'There is reason to be cheerful at Christmas and many reasons to be optimistic in 2014. It does feel that the economy is really starting to gather momentum. We are expecting a good year and we are optimistic that the recovery is taking hold.' He added that consumer confidence and the housing market are improving, and that he expects industry to begin investing again next year. Mr Boxshall said: 'I expect as the year progresses that will help a more balanced recovery than we are seeing at the moment.' PwC forecasts that inflation will be at 2.3percent on average in 2014, slightly above the Bank of England's 2percent target. Warning: Mr Cable told the BBC's Andrew Marr the Help to Buy scheme should be reworked . The accountancy firm said that 2014 will be the year when advanced economies such as the UK and the US start to 'get their mojo back' after the devastating financial crisis that peaked in 2008. The firm admitted that real wages will fall for the sixth year in a row, meaning that households will continue to see their spending power squeezed as their salaries fail to keep pace with rising prices. However, it said it expects the pressure on household budgets will start to ease as wages begin to catch up with inflation. PwC expects unemployment to fall by the end of next year to 7percent - the threshold set by Bank of England governor Mark Carney to start thinking about hiking interest rates from their current ultra-low level of 0.5per cent. That is two years sooner than Carney initially expected. House prices are forecast to increase by around 4pc on average next year, though home values will still not have recovered their pre-crisis highs, and will remain more than 10pc below their peak at the end of 2014. On the up: House prices are forecast to increase by around 4pc on average next year, though home values will still not have recovered their pre-crisis highs . But homeowners received a double warning about a new housing bubble. Mr Cable told the BBC's Andrew Marr the Help to Buy scheme should be reworked: 'We certainly need to look at that [scheme] again. It was conceived in very different circumstances. 'There is a raging housing boom in London and the south-east, not in other parts of the country.' Mr Cable said that raising mortgage rates to deter homebuyers would 'hit those parts of the country which are not yet fully recovered'. But he added: 'On the other hand if you don't increase interest rates then of course this boom that's taking place in house prices gets out of control and the only people who can live in large parts of London are foreigners and bankers and we don't want that either.' The Bank of England also pledged to step in if the property market becomes overheated again amid signs that a new housing bubble is being created. Predictions: PwC said that 2014 will be the year when advanced economies such as the UK and the US start to 'get their mojo back' after the devastating financial crisis that peaked in 2008 . Deputy Governor Andrew Bailey said regulators would make it more difficult for people to get mortgages if the market becomes a 'free for all'. As head of the Prudential Regulation Authority at the bank, Mr Bailey can reduce loan-to-value ratios, making products such as 95pc mortgages more expensive for homebuyers. He said: 'We are watching the housing market very carefully.' Mr Cable was slapped down by Housing Minister Kris Hopkins, who pointed out that just one in fifty sales in recent months have been a result of the Help to Buy scheme. Mr Hopkins said the scheme was not inflationary. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that there would be 3.7 billion transactions over the three years from April 2013 to March 2016, meaning Help to Buy would account for less than 2% of overall transactions. But Labour's Hilary Benn said house prices would continue to soar unless the Government ensures that more houses are built. 'If we don't increase supply, all you're going to do is push house prices out of reach of many.'","UK economy likely to grown by 2-3percent, outstripping Eurozone rivals .

Tragedy: Cpl Kevin Gale Stauffer, 38, was killed after trying to apprehend a car of suspected bank robbers . The FBI has launched a nationwide search for a gunman who killed a policeman during a bank robbery just two days before Christmas. Father-of-two Corporal Kevin Gale Stauffer, 38, from Tupelo, Mississippi, was shot when he tried to stop suspects in a car as they waited at a level crossing. At least one of the gang fired Cpl Stauffer at close range from inside the vehicle before driving off, ABC News reported. Fellow officer, Joseph Maher, 27, was also shot and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition. Detectives today increased the reward from $152,000 to $162,500 for information that can help them catch the suspects, believed to have robbed BancorpSouth bank in Tupelo.

Onwards and upwards: Prime Minister David Cameron is likely to increase interest rates in 2014 . Half of pensioners want higher interest rates to counteract the disastrous effect of years of low returns on their savings. Fifty per cent of the over-60s say a rise in interest rates would make them better off, according to a survey. By contrast, just 7 per cent say their finances would suffer. Over all ages, more people think they will benefit from higher interest rates, which is good news for David Cameron as a rate rise becomes more likely in the run-up to the election. The survey shows that two thirds of people believe an increase would improve their personal finances or would make no difference. The Bank of England has kept interest rates at 0.5 per cent since March 2009. Chancellor George Osborne has cited the need to keep interest rates low as a justification for his austerity policies. Higher rates are bad for homeowners, because they increase the cost of mortgage payments. It was thought this would make a rate increase unpopular,  costing the Tories votes in 2015. But lower rates are bad for  savers, who do not get as much interest on their nest eggs. Rates at such a low level as 0.5 per cent mean that, when inflation is taken into account, savings are actually falling in value. Many elderly people who rely on money saved throughout their lives to top up their pensions would welcome a rate rise. Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser on pensions, said: ‘Those in or approaching retirement have often saved hard and expect to live on their savings, but what they’ve experienced is a wipeout. ‘Savings have been the sacrificial lamb of policies which have encouraged people to borrow. Conditions: Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, has said he will only increase interest rates if unemployment falls below 7 per cent . ‘Those who have been responsible have had their savings taken away, while those who have borrowed more than they can afford have had a huge bonanza. The message is, “You’re a mug to save because we could take it away at any time”. ‘If one is retired, there is nothing you can do to retrieve your income in future – that’s it.’ A rise in interest rates will be bad news for many homeowners who are mortgaged to the hilt, experts have warned. Home repossessions will go up when interest rates rise and the glut of cheap home loan deals dry up as some households struggle to afford their mortgages. Bob Pannell, chief economist at the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said: ‘The benign period of falling arrears and possessions may be coming  to an end.’ Rock-bottom interest rates have been a boon to homeowners for almost five years. The number of repossessions has been dropping for years, with 30,000 expected this year, down from 75,500 during the 1991 recession. But the Bank of England estimates that 8 per cent of households are now ‘vulnerable’ – meaning they spend more than 35 per cent of their income before tax on mortgage repayments. It said this figure could double if it raises the base rate – frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – to 3 per cent. One in six households are mortgaged to the hilt, servicing home loans that are at least four times bigger than their annual salary. A pre-election rise in interest rates looks increasingly likely as the economy begins to recover. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said he would only consider putting rates up if unemployment fell to 7 per cent, which is expected before the election in 2015. Many had assumed such a move would be a disaster for David Cameron because it would push up the cost of millions of families’ mortgages. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has warned against an interest rate rise, saying: ‘The danger of raising interest rates is that you hit those parts of the country which are not yet fully recovered and you push up the exchange rate. That hits manufacturers. We don’t want that.’ But the results of the YouGov poll, in The Times, appear to show that a rise might not be a disaster for the Tories. Around 45 per cent of people expect rates to go up some time next year, of whom 31 per cent believe they would be better off as a result and 23 per cent say they would be poorer. A further 32 per cent said a rise or fall would make little difference, while 14 per cent said they did not know. YouGov president Peter Kellner said: ‘For the moment, when inflation looks set to stay low, a modest rise in interest rates is actually likely to please far more people than it troubles. ‘If David Cameron and George Osborne can preside over low consumer-price inflation but higher rises in the price of homes – and other assets such as shares – then some rise in interest rates is likely to win them more votes than it loses.’","People across all ages believe they would benefit from higher interest rates .

Russian oligarch Sergei Pugachev is wanted in his home country on fraud charges, it was reported . The Russian oligarch who was once a business partner of the Queen's nephew Viscount Linley is wanted in his home country on fraud charges, according to reports in Moscow. Sergei Pugachev, who splits his time between luxury homes in London and Monaco, is wanted for questioning by the Investigative Committee, the Russian equivalent of the FBI, on 'large-scale appropriation' relating to the collapsed financial institution, Mezhprombank. The charges could carry a jail sentence of up to ten years. Lawyers for Mr Pugachev, 50, are expected to appeal against the warrant in court in Moscow on Friday. Once labelled the 'cashier to the Kremlin' and formerly seen as close to Vladimir Putin, the businessman is also the lover of glamorous British socialite Alexandra Tolstoy, with whom he has three small children. Reports in Moscow say the arrest warrant was issued in absentia, He is also on Russia's international wanted list. In recent years the tycoon's fortune is reported to have slumped from £3 billion to under £250 million after he lost key business interests and his Senate seat. A hunting partner of Lord Linley, the Russian injected cash into the royal's furniture business in 2008, at one pointing owning 40 per cent of David Linley Holdings, but left the board in August 2011, with the bespoke furniture and interior design company owing £400,000 to Mezhprombank, a sum which is still being repaid. Pugachev - once called the 'perfect partner' by the Viscount - is wanted for questioning over the alleged transfer of unsecured state loans to Luxembourg, say media reports citing law-enforcement sources. 'Sergei Pugachev is being pursued now,' reported Kommersant newspaper, owned by Kremlin-friendly billionaire Alisher Usmanov, also a shareholder of Arsenal FC. The newspaper claimed he faces immediate arrest if he crosses the border into Russia. While Russian police have raided Pugachev's businesses before, this is the first time he has faced an arrest warrant and criminal as well as civil action of the bank's collapse. The Queen's nephew Viscount Linley (pictured) is a former business partner of Sergei Pugachev . Tolstoy, 40, daughter of historian Count Nikolai Tolstoy, split from her Cossack horseman husband Shamil Galimzyanov after she became pregnant by married Pugachev in 2008. A Moscow judge this month rejected Galimzyanov's bid to overturn a post-nuptial agreement which gave the £250,000 one bedroom flat, where he still lives, to her. She told him that she needed money for her children. 'She hooked a billionaire, and at the same time she is kicking me out of the only apartment I have to live in, and says she has no money or home,' said her ex-husband, who is to appeal the court decision. Last month, a £1.3 billion civil claim was lodged with a tribunal in Moscow by a Russian government agency against Pugachev and three senior executives of bankrupt Mezhprombank. His French luxury goods retailer Hediard filed for insolvency in October. Pugachev's lawyers are on record as denying any wrongdoing.","Sergei Pugachev wanted for questioning by Russian equivalent of FBI .

It is unclear whether the couple is already divorced or whether they are planning to divorce. Ms Linden would not elaborate on the statement. Multiple reports indicate that the Spitzers have been living apart for some time. Mrs Spitzer was also noticeably absent from the campaign trail this past . year. Spitzer . has repeatedly refused to comment on his personal life and says he is . only staying at his parents' apartment because they are in poor health. The couple have three grown daughters together: Elyssa, 23, Sarabeth, 20, and Jenna, 18. Spitzer and his wife Silda stayed married for five and a half years after the scandal that cratered his meteoric political career. It's unknown whether the timing of Silda and Eliot's split has anything to do with the his relationship with Miss Smith going public. A friend of the new couple told MailOnline: 'The relationship began long after Eliot and his wife were living separately and it was not a secret to any of their friends or family.

'She's dealing with this well and is looking forward to getting on with her career and life.' The New York Post snapped pictures of Spitzer arriving around 10pm two nights in a row last week, then leaving before dawn. The disgraced politician was seen dashing from the building shortly before 6am before hopping in a cab a few streets away. On one occasion, the pair walked together from the apartment to a nearby restaurant, the cozy French bistro Le Pescadeux. The manager of the restaurant told the Post . that the couple were regulars, adding: 'The first time I saw Spitzer, I . didn’t know if he was Eliot Spitzer or Anthony Weiner. Those two are . like the same exact guy.' Spitzer and his alleged girlfriend Lis Smith were seen slipping into the romantic French bistro Le Pescadeux last week for a late-night dinner before heading back to her nearby apartment . After the romantic meal, the couple were seen entering Miss Smith's apartment building together. Miss Smith joined De Blasio after Spitzer lost in the September primary. She has also served as the spokeswoman for the Mayor-elect during his transition. The Daily News reports that Miss Smith is a frontrunner to become De Blasio's press secretary after he is formally sworn in. In 2012, she led the 'rapid response team' on President Obama's reelection campaign.

Margaret Thatcher is pictured with Charles Haughey outside 10 Downing Street two years before the incident in question . Margaret Thatcher threatened to cancel a visit to Ireland because it was being ‘unfriendly’ about the Falklands War, newly declassified files reveal. The then prime minister was in no mood to meet with taoiseach Charles Haughey – because Ireland planned to back calls for a ceasefire. State documents show how, during one of the most critical stages of the war with Argentina, Britain pushed Ireland to abstain from a planned United Nations ceasefire resolution. Ireland had let it be known it was in favour of ending military action. An unnamed Irish diplomat at the UN sent a cable to Dublin warning about the threats from London after having lunch with the then Conservative foreign secretary Francis Pym. At the meeting in June 1982, Mr Pym said he felt Anglo-Irish relations were ‘getting worse every day’. The deterioration was particularly disappointing to Mrs Thatcher, who accepted the ‘unique relationship’ between the countries, he said. The official told Dublin in the cable: ‘In her present mood he could not give any assurance that the PM would wish to have a meeting with the taoiseach, although he added that a week is, of course, a long time in  politics and things could change.’ The files, released into the National Archives under the 30-year rule, show Mr Pym asked Ireland to at least abstain from voting. But the diplomat wrote: ‘I gave him no hope of this.’ The diplomat also spoke to Sir Antony Acland, then head of the British diplomatic service. The official told Dublin in the cable: 'In her present mood he could not give any assurance that the PM would wish to have a meeting with the taoiseach' ‘He hinted, without saying so bluntly, that the PM might find it politically difficult to visit Ireland this year if we continued to play a role seen by No 10 Downing Street as unfriendly to Britain,’ he wrote. He added: 'I insisted we were in favour of a ceasefire leading to peace in the interests of all concerned, including the islanders and that it was this approach which had guided out actions at the UN.' In the event, Britain vetoed the resolution, and two days later the Versailles summit supported its stance on the conflict.","Documents reveal Prime Minister did not want to meet Charles Haughey .

Family spokesman Christopher Winters says eight-year-old Delaney 'Laney' Brown of West Reading 'passed away quietly with her loving family by her side' early Christmas morning.An update posted on the Team Laney Facebook page written by Laney's mother Jennifer Brown reads, 'My heart breaks right now.

The family is still struggling to come to terms with the little girl's loss. 'This house is still full of all the medical machines and her birthday presents, her Christmas presents,' posted Laney's father, Jeremiah Brown. 'There used to be a little girl normally already sitting on our couch watching TV when I wake up early in the morning. My life will never be the same since that little angel touched it.' Winters says the family is requesting privacy now 'to celebrate their daughter's life and to mourn her loss.' Laney Brown is survived by her parents and two siblings. 'Not only do we have the emotional anguish of losing our child but we also have to comfort our other children and let them know it will be okay even when you aren't sure of it yourself,' wrote Jennifer Brown on Facebook. 'Her little sister is taking it very hard. She woke up this morning with thoughts of opening Christmas presents with her sister and was met by our sorrow filled faces waiting to tell her that her best friend in this world, her sister, is no longer sleeping comfortably in her bed downstairs but is now in heaven.' Laney Brown was diagnosed in May with a rare form of leukemia. Last wish: Thousands gathered Saturday evening outside the West Reading, Pennsylvania home of 8-year-old Delaney Brown, who is dying from a rare form of cancer . Touching: Over 4,000 people said they'd attend Delaney's sing-along and photos show a huge crowd outside the ailing 8-year-old's Pennsylvania home . 'I can hear you now!!!

She really engaged Laney in conversation. Laney lit up and had a huge smile on her face. I can't thank Taylor enough.’ 'Prior to her cancer she was a normal kid,' writes Delaney's mother.

An inmate walked out of a notorious open prison dubbed ‘Holiday Bay’ because he wanted to avoid the ‘temptation of illegal drugs’, a court heard. Graeme Shepherd, 41, browsed in a village post office and strolled around the village of Hollesley for three hours before being arrested in the grounds of a church. His barrister told a court he had taken ‘positive action’ to escape Hollesley Bay prison in the hope of being sent back to a closed jail, after an earlier formal request for a transfer had been turned down by the open jail. Graeme Shepherd fled Hollesley Bay jail (pictured) as he claimed he wanted to avoid the 'temptation of illegal drugs' Alan Wheetman, defending, said the request to be moved from the category D jail at Hollesley, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, was refused because Shepherd had refused to name prisoners involved in the supply of drugs. Mr Wheetman told Ipswich Crown Court on Tuesday: ‘He realised that in order to get away from Hollesley Bay he would have to take some positive action. 'He realised that anyone who escaped would be transferred back to closed conditions. ‘He has found it difficult in an open prison because of the temptation of illegal drugs. He says there is an awful lot of drugs in Hollesley Bay.’ Lee Chapman (pictured) previously claimed drugs were readily available at the prison as well as mobile phones . Mr Wheetman said Shepherd had been free of drugs since 2009 and had undergone regular voluntary testing in prison. Prosecutor Hugh Vass said Shepherd was found missing by a prison officer carrying out a morning roll call on December 11. Shepherd, who is serving an indefinite sentence for robbery, was located in the grounds of All Saints Church, Hollesley, by a policeman later that day. Mr Vass said: ‘He said he didn’t want to go back to drug taking and had done it for his own safety.’ Shepherd admitted escaping from lawful custody on December 11 and was ordered to serve an additional four months on top of his original sentence by Judge Rupert Overbury. Hollesley Bay prison has long been nicknamed Holiday Bay because of its relaxed atmosphere and sea views. A serving prisoner claimed in November last year that drugs and phones were easily available at the prison and that women had stayed overnight at the jail. The claims were made at Ipswich Crown Court by a barrister representing Lee Chapman, 34, before the defendant was sentenced for carrying out six burglaries while on the run from the jail - where he was serving a life sentence for arson with intent to endanger life, and burglary. Prison bosses strenuously denied the claim that women were permitted to sleep at the jail and said the possession of drugs or phones by inmates was treated as a criminal offence. Another inmate William Barlow, 30, who also went on the run because he did not like the jail’s ‘lax attitude’ to drugs was jailed for four weeks last October. Ipswich Crown Court heard how the defendant wanted to escape the jail as he is trying not to take illegal drugs . Ipswich Crown Court head how former drug user Barlow hoped to get caught and transferred to another prison even though he only had two weeks left to serve of a three and a half year sentence for burglary. He claimed he had to get away because other inmates were putting pressure on him to bring Class A drugs into the jail. In October, bank raider Kevin Smith, 29, went on the run from the prison just ten days after he had arrived. He had been transferred to the jail just two months into a five year term for conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to steal a motor vehicle.","Graeme Shepherd claims to have fled Hollesley Bay to avoid illegal drugs .

Louie Jenkins has now taken his first steps on prosthetic legs after his older sister, Francesca (right), tried to teach him how to walk by bribing him with Haribo sweets . A boy of two who had to have both legs amputated after contracting meningitis has taken his first ever steps after being enticed onto his feet - by the offer of Haribo gummy bear sweets. Louie Jenkins was taken ill early 2012 when he was six months old and had an operation to remove his legs in March last year. The toddler also had to have all the fingers on his left hand amputated and the fingertips on his right hand removed. His devastated parents thought they would never see their son walk, but when Louie was given prosthetic legs in June 2012 they were given fresh hope when he was given a pair of prosthetic limbs. Eventually after his big sister Francesca, six, stood at the opposite side of their living room waving a bag of Haribos which include gummy beras, and liquorice Louie shocked his parents Julie, 30, and Warren, 31, when he stood up on his prosthetic legs and walked across the room to help himself. Now despite setbacks including chicken pox and eczema, little Louie has finally got used to wearing his new limbs and is using the slide and walks hand-in-hand with his parents like any other toddler. He can now manage over twenty steps at a time before he has to stop for a break. His mother Julie, a former teaching assistant from Colne, Lancashire said: ‘Doctors told us Louie may never walk, but we always remained positive because even though he was still so young we could already see how much of a determined little boy he was.‘ . Louie can now walk 20 steps on his new legs before getting tired . When Louie was given his new legs we . were quite nervous. We worried that he might not be able to get used to . them and for a while he was a bit unsure. Francesca has been trying to . get Louie to walk for ages and like all children Louie loves sweets, so . Francesca had the idea to hold sweets up to Louie to encourage him to . walk. ‘I held . Louie on one side of the room and his dad and sister stood at the . opposite side of the living room holding Haribo sweets out to Louie. ‘We all watched him stand up and walk over to Francesca. He had such a determined look on his face and when he took his first steps we couldn't believe it. The sweets obviously worked. ‘It was a fantastic moment. It was so emotional for all of us.’ The family set up the Little LAMB (Louie's Amazing Meningitus Battle) appeal to help buy the toddler the equipment needed to support him as he grows. They seek to raise £30,000 for a specialist downstairs wet room and bedroom for Louie. Julie added: ‘When we were first told Louie would have to have his legs amputated we were heartbroken. 'He was just a baby and for Warren and I to have to see him so ill was devastating. Louie with his mother Julie, at seven months old . Louie's mother, Julie, described the moment that he began walking as very emotional . ‘Louie was in hospital for a total of eleven weeks and I stayed with him the whole time. ‘My husband Warren works as a welder and fabricator and he had to take care of our daughter, so he would travel from home to Leeds General Infirmary to see us at weekends. ‘The legs Louie has now are his fourth pair because every time he grows he has to get a new pair. It's a bit like when children Louie's age grow out of shoes really quickly. ‘Francesca is so proud of her little brother. She was so excited when he walked for the first time. She couldn't wait to tell everybody at school about it. ‘I go through feeling ecstatic at the fact that he is walking but then often a sadness comes over me because he has spent so long struggling. ‘He has been through so much in his early life. He's truly amazing. Every week he is improving more and more. He is getting more confident and Warren and I have high hopes for him in the future.’ Devastating illness: Pictured is Louie in hospital with meningitis .","Louie Jenkins was taken ill in 2012 when he was just six months old .

A mother who stabbed her baby daughter with a kitchen knife has won the right to stay in Britain – so she can stay in touch with the girl she tried to kill. The woman was jailed for five years for attempting to murder her daughter when the girl was just eight months old. After completing her jail sentence she was due to be deported to her home country of Bangladesh. 'An appallingly difficult case': A tribunal has ruled that a woman who stabbed her baby girl with a kitchen knife will not be deported because that would separate her from her child (photo posed by models) But the family courts gave her the right to see her daughter under tight supervision for an hour three times a year – and she has now won the right to stay in Britain permanently. A judge ruled it would be ‘very cruel’ to stop her from seeing the child. She won her case using Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to a private and family life. Controversial: The decision was made by Mr Justice Mostyn . When the Home Office appealed, another judge described the earlier ruling as ‘generous’ but refused to overturn it. The woman – who cannot be named because it would identify the child, came to Britain in September 2007 after marrying her cousin in an arranged ceremony the year before. Despite speaking no English and having never been to Britain before, she moved to be with him in a maisonette in Tower Hamlets, East London. Their daughter was born in June 2008. The marriage was unhappy and in March 2009 the 30-year-old’s husband presented her with a one-way ticket for her to return to Bangladesh. He also obtained a court order banning her from taking the child out of the country. The mother told relatives she would kill the baby and kill herself rather than be separated from her daughter, saying: ‘If I can’t have her then no-one will.’ Her husband left her alone with the child and returned to find her stabbing the girl in the stomach. He grabbed the child and ran upstairs with her – with the mother chasing after him with the knife – before she was overpowered by his brother. The Old Bailey heard she left a 1.6in stab wound and the baby would have died if the thrust had not caught one of her ribs. Afterwards the woman asked her husband: ‘Why couldn’t you come in later? Then I could have finished her off?’, the court heard. The sentencing judge accepted the ticket and the court injunction ‘came out of the blue and it was a cruel act which left her no room to take advice about her situation’. He also accepted that she was in an ‘overpowering situation’ and was facing ‘huge emotional turmoil’ – so jailed her for just five years. In July 2011, while still behind bars, she was granted access to her daughter, by then nearly three years old, by the Family Courts. Migration: The woman had moved from Bangladesh to Tower Hamlets in east London, pictured . That ruling was made by Mr Justice Mostyn, the same judge who, sitting in the Court of Protection, allowed doctors to sedate a pregnant woman to perform a caesarean without her consent. The child was then a ward of the court – and her mother was allowed to see her three times a year for one hour under strict supervision. He wrote that it was ‘positively in the interests of this little girl for her to see her mother’. He wrote: ‘From these small beginnings, it may well be that, as time progresses, something more meaningful can be built up, although that will inevitably be a difficult progress given the nature of the crime which was committed by the mother.’ When the mother was released from prison in December 2011 she was informed by the Home Office that she faced deportation because of the horrific attack. A tribunal ruled in her favour in March 2013 on the basis of Article 8, saying removal from Britain would ‘not be proportionate’. Judge Christopher Buckwell said it would be a ‘very cruel decision indeed’ for both the mother and her daughter to ‘effectively end contact’ between them. The tribunal concluded: ‘It is entirely appreciated that it is on a very limited basis at the present time but in our view it is overwhelmingly significant that contact has been permitted and endorsed by the courts.’ The Home Office appealed – saying it was in the public interest to deport her. Shock: The woman was jailed for five years at the Old Bailey (pictured) but then allowed to see her child in prison . Before the Upper Tribunal, lawyers for the Home Secretary argued that the mother had ‘damaged her daughter emotionally and psychologically and further contact would cause her daughter harm’. They said the child, who is now four and a half, ‘does not even fully recognise who she is’ and has only seen her mother on seven occasions since 2010. And they said the daughter ‘may not even want to know her when she is older and knows what has happened’ and that further contact would cause her daughter further harm. But Upper Tribunal Judge Deborah Taylor, while admitting the decision of the lower court was ‘generous’, refused to overturn its ruling in what she described as an ‘appallingly difficult case’. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are disappointed and surprised with this verdict and we have applied to the Court of Appeal for the right to challenge it. ‘Those who come to the UK must abide by our laws. We will take all necessary steps to deport foreign criminals and have introduced tough new rules to protect the public from those who try to stay here through abuse of the Human Rights Act. ‘Our Immigration Bill will clarify our policy to the courts, that foreign criminals should ordinarily be deported despite their claim to a family life.’","Woman was jailed for five years for attempted murder with kitchen knife .

Tools of the trade: Home baking star Mary berry is launching her own range of kitchen equipment for Lakeland . The success of the Great British Bake Off has seen sales of kitchen accessories soar. Now one of its stars is taking a slice of the action with her own range of baking equipment for Lakeland. Mary Berry, who taught the nation to make everything from simple cupcakes to show-stopping chocolate gateaux, has published countless recipes. But her fans will now be able to make them using tools that meet her exacting standards. Celebrity chefs such as Heston .

Berry’s devotees will be able to float about the kitchen in aprons . carrying her stamp of approval, while wielding her palette knives, flour . sifters and cake lifters. There is also a range of ‘pushpans’ – cake . tins with loose bases that allow bakers to turn out the perfect creation . without worrying that it might get stuck – and a ‘traybake’ for cooking . brownies and other sweet treats. These are non-stick and provide cutting guides so users can turn out cakes that are uniform. Miss . Berry has a long association with Lakeland that dates back to the late . 1960s. She was involved in the early designs of some of the firm’s . customer favourites. The Bake Off judge hopes her range will inspire yet more home cooks to take up a whisk. ‘I firmly believe that, equipped with the right tools and a simple recipe, anyone can achieve great results in the kitchen,’ she said. Miss Berry added: ‘It’s important to me that the products in the range really “work” … I have worked to ensure each piece is both easy to use and practical.’ Kitchen kit: Mary Berry's pushpans, from £10.99, make removing cakes easier . Non-stick: The traybake, also £10.99, can be used to cook brownies and other sweet treats in the kitchen . Lakeland’s Veronica Davidson visited the ‘Queen of Cakes’ at her home and went through her cupboards as part of the design process – and the partnership promises to be lucrative for both parties. The Great British Bake Off has had a remarkable impact on sales of equipment and ingredients. When the BBC series returned this year, John Lewis reported sales of hand mixers were up 23 per cent, measuring spoons by 29 per cent and paper cake cases by 44 per cent.","Fans will be able to wear aprons carrying Mary Berry's stamp of approval .

A tremor initially thought to have been 2.9 on the Richter scale woke residents at 1.37am. Its epicentre was around 2km east of the isle’s capital of St Helier and was recorded by the British Geological Survey. There have been no reports of damage from the earthquake which was felt around the island. An earthquake rumbled through the town of St Helier on Jersey, waking residents up in the dead of the night . One resident said there was ‘a very large bang’ and he felt the side of the house shaking. Another resident, Viv Petit, tweeted: ‘Felt it, thought might have been an explosion in St Helier. Rumbling noise, doors shook.’ There are around 200 to 300 earthquakes in Britain every year, but the vast majority are so small that no one notices them. Between 20 are 30 are over 2.0 magnitude which can be felt over a wider area. John Searson of the Jersey Meteorological Department said that an earthquake in Brittany in November and felt on the island had measured just over 4 on the Richter Scale. It was possible that yesterday’s quake was the earth settling after that, he added. Between 200-300 earthquakes occur in the UK every year though the vast majority are too slight to notice . UK earthquakes, particularly in Scotland, are most often attributed to glacial rebound. Until about 10, 500 years ago much of the north of the UK was covered by a thick layer of ice - which pushed the rocks down into the underlying mantle. These rocks have been slowly rising back up ever since the ice melted, causing occasional earthquakes in the process. The UK is also subject to tectonic stresses caused by the expansion of the Atlantic Ocean, which is slowly pushing the entire of Eurasia to the east, and from the northward motion of Africa, which is pushing into Europe from the south.","The earthquake woke residents at 1.37am on Boxing Day .

Snowden left his NSA post in Hawaii in May and went public with his first revelations from Hong Kong a few weeks later. In June, he left for Russia and stayed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport for nearly six weeks until the Kremlin granted him temporary one-year asylum. The United States has revoked his passport and demanded he be sent home to face charges for stealing secrets. Earlier this month there were signs of thawing attitudes when Richard Ledgett - a top NSA official who leads a taskforce at the agency responding to the leaks - left open the option for Snowden to return to the United States in an amnesty. 'It's worth having a conversation about,' he told CBS. Snowden warned of dangers to democracy in the first video released of the fugitive since arriving in Russia . 'I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured and my bar for those assurances would be very high,' Ledgett said. Senior officials in the Obama administration remain opposed to such a move. Last week a White House-appointed panel proposed curbs on some key NSA surveillance operations, recommending limits on a programme to collect records of billions of telephone calls, and new tests before Washington spies on foreign leaders. 'The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it,' Snowden said in the Christmas address.

As it stands, US technology lovers can only take their instructions from a woman while those in the UK are given directions by a man's voice. But all that is about to change. Apple unveiled earlier this week that its latest software update for the iPhone will see users able to choose whether the phone's built-in personal assistant Siri speaks with a male or female voice. For the first time, users of the phone will have a choice which sex Siri takes the form of when it tells them where the nearest takeaway is or puts an appointment in your mobile schedule. New technology: Apple software developers unveiled the latest updates for its IOS software for the iPhone earlier this week . And according to Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University in the US, research has shown that iPhone fans may trust male Siri's answers more than those that come from his female counterpart. Nass, who studies people's interaction with technology, said: 'Female voices are seen, on average, as less intelligent than male voices. 'It’s safer in a sense to have a male voice in the sense that you’re not going to disappoint people as much.' The new option offers users another opportunity to customise their phones, similar to options that allow users to customise their ringtones or chose an individual picture as their screen background. The male voice which will be introduced for the first time to US users will already seem familiar to them as it is used on the Apple Support hotline and the United Airlines hotline, according to the Huffington Post. New look: Apple unveiled a new user interface for its iPhone earlier this week . The original creators of the technology behind Siri, which was snapped up first by Apple, are said to have envisaged multiple Siri characters and wanted to install technology that would see the iPhone mimic it's user way of talking. But Nass said that Apple risks alienating customers by offering a choice of male or female Siri. He told the Huffington Post that men and women tend to use different dialect as well as sounding different. He said that unless the software sees separate dialects recorded for the male and female Siris then users won't trust the interface. Leila Takayama, a research scientist at Willow Garage, a robotics firm, said that having a choice of voices may lead users to see Siri as more of a technology than a personality. Experts claimed when Siri was initially launched that dominant gender stereotypes in different nations dictated whether a male or female voice was used.","Until now, US iPhone users have only been able to talk to a female Siri .

He perfected it in the lead-up to the Vancouver Olympics and landed it on his second run at the games, using it even though he'd already wrapped up the gold medal on his first run.

Suspended: Breast surgeon Ian Paterson performed cleavage sparing mastectomies on hundreds of women . A cancer surgeon may have botched more than 4,500 breast operations even though colleagues had warned hospital bosses about him for years, an official report said yesterday. But the NHS probe was described as a whitewash last night by victims because it failed to hold surgeon Ian Paterson to account. Sir Ian Kennedy, author of the 166-page report, did not even interview Paterson, who has been suspended  and is being investigated by police. Declaring that ‘naming and shaming’ would not solve the case, he focused instead on management errors. A footnote says he ‘did not have the opportunity’ to speak to Paterson because the surgeon ‘may have found it difficult’. Paterson, 56, may face charges over allegations that he convinced 450 healthy women to have operations needlessly. He is also accused of performing experimental ‘cleavage-sparing’ mastectomies, in which tissue is left behind for cosmetic reasons, on 700 patients without their permission. It is alleged that this may raise the risk of them developing cancer by up to 50 per cent. Yesterday, it was revealed that a further 3,500 women who had lumpectomies and other breast operations at Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, West Midlands, may also have had their procedures botched and could be recalled. Up to 400 women are thought to be suing the trust and a private firm over the operations. Sir Ian said the doctor was ‘charismatic and charming’ and ‘liked by his patients’ but was not regarded as a team player. Shirley Moroney wants Paterson to be charged with the manslaughter of her sister Marie Pinfield, who died after he gave her a cleavage-sparing operation in 2006 when others claimed she needed a double mastectomy. Senior medical negligence solicitor Kashmir Uppal with Paula Gelsthorpe, Victoria Weaver, Rachel Butler, Gail Boichat, Helen Gardiner and Marie Bailey, who are taking legal action against the hospital trust . A cleavage sparing mastectomy involved leaving . behind some breast tissue to provide an improved cleavage for the . patient. But it breached national guidelines, which state that leaving tissue after a mastectomy increases the chances of cancer recurring - especially if the remaining breast tissue does not receive radiotherapy. This is because a significant proportion of breast tissue is deliberately left by the surgeon in the inner aspect of the breast in order to give the patient breast cleavage - even in women not undergoing immediate reconstruction. The technique is different to the widely-used skin sparing mastectomy, where the surgeon leaves behind an envelope of skin to improve the appearance of breast reconstruction. Her . cancer returned and she died two years later at 50. Mrs Moroney, 51, . said of Sir Ian’s report: ‘It was a waste of time. He was in a part-time . role, he had no researchers, no staff. It was a farce, a whitewash. If . Paterson’s views have not been included, what was the point?’ Paterson . worked at NHS and private hospitals across the Midlands from 1994 until . he was suspended last year. He was employed by Heart of England in . March 1998, having been suspended by another trust. Colleagues . became concerned that he was not removing enough tissue during . mastectomies and two investigations were carried out, in 2003 and 2004. Although a number of recommendations were made about his surgery, nothing was done to stop him. Fears . raised by a surgeon in 2007 were not properly acted upon. Paterson was . told to stop cleavage-sparing operations but continued until as late as . 2011. Paterson was suspended by the trust in May 2011 but his pay was not stopped for 18 months. Sir . Ian said: ‘This is a tragic story... of women faced with a . life-threatening disease who have been harmed, of clinicians at their . wits’ ends trying for years to get the trust to address what was going . on, of secrecy and containment, of a surgeon who chose to operate on . women in a way unrecognised by peers and thereby exposed them to harm.’ Gail Boichat was given an unnecessary mastectomy by Paterson 18 years ago, only to find out later that her breast should never have been removed . Sir Ian said that what happened at Solihull Hospital between 2003 and 2011 was a 'tragic story' that was also a story of 'secrecy and containment' Surgery: Mr Paterson operated at a number of hospitals in the Solihull area of the West Midlands from 1994 until 2011. He was suspended by the GMC last year . When policewoman Marie Pinfield was . diagnosed with cancer in her left breast in 2006, she was in no doubt . what she wanted her hospital consultant to do. Terrified that the . grade 3 tumour would eventually kill her, the 48-year-old requested a . bilateral mastectomy to remove both her breasts and all trace of the . cancer. Breast cancer nurses showed her pictures of other women . who'd undergone a double mastectomy so that she could make an informed . decision about what she would look like following the loss of her 38GG . bust. Marie Pinfield (left) pictured with her sister Shirley Moroney. Marie was diagnosed with cancer in her left breast in 2006 but died after her requests for treatment were ignored, her sister says . Not once did she waver, telling her family: 'I'm scared . my breasts will be the end of me.' She was determined to survive at all . costs, but her words would prove to be tragically prophetic. After . undergoing two operations, followed by chemo and radiotherapy, Marie . died on October 21, 2008 at the Marie Curie Hospice in Solihull, . surrounded by family and friends after the breast cancer spread to her . lungs. She was only 50 years old. 'I am haunted by the thought that Marie could be alive today,' her sister, Shirley Moroney, 50, told the Mail earlier this year. 'She was not only my sister but my best friend, and I miss her every day.' Ms Pinfield's family claim she made her wishes for a double mastectomy very clear to staff at Solihull Hospital. They cannot comprehend the clinical decisions Mr Paterson made and are demanding answers. Suspicious: Ms Moroney believes some medical staff within Solihull Hospital tried to blow the whistle about the quality of Mr Paterson's surgery long before he was suspended . Ms Moroney said her sister was devastated when she came round from her surgery because her breasts were still there. 'When Mr Paterson arrived, I said: “Why does Marie still have breasts?” He seemed extremely put out and replied: “I know exactly what I'm doing. I have removed all the mammary glands and all she has left is fatty tissue.” He said the cancer had been removed. 'I was furious because I felt her wishes had been ignored.' However, in a letter to lawyers acting for Shirley, the Trust has since accepted that insufficient tissue was removed on that - and a subsequent - occasion.

A previously unclassified type of star that gets lighter and darker over a fixed time period has been discovered. Scientists have long known of 'pulsating' stars that vary in luminosity but these new heavenly bodies get lighter and darker at periods of between two and 20 hours. They were found in a stellar cluster - NGC 3766, in the constellation of Centaurus - located 7,000 light years from Earth by the European Southern Observatory using the La Silla Observatory in Chile. A seven-year study found 36 of the . 3,000 stars displayed the tiny variations in brightness. The . 20-million-year-old stars, hotter and brighter than our sun, do not fit . into any known category of pulsating star and are as yet unnamed. Stars hide your fires: A new type of variable star in the Centaurus constellation has been discovered by a group of European Space Observatory astronomers at La Silla Observatory, Chile . How the brightness of these stars changes depends in complex ways on the properties of their interiors. This phenomenon has allowed the development of a whole branch of astrophysics called asteroseismology, where astronomers can 'listen' to these stellar vibrations, in order to probe the physical properties of the stars and get to know more about their inner workings. 'The very existence of this new class of variable stars is a challenge to astrophysicists,' says Sophie Saesen, one of the team members involved in the study. 'Current theoretical models predict that their light is not supposed to vary periodically at all, so our current efforts are focused on finding out more about the behaviour of this strange new type of star.' Nami Mowlavi, leader of the research team, which used a 1.2-metre . Euler telescope to carry out the research, said: 'We have reached this . level of sensitivity thanks to the high quality of the observations, . combined with a very careful analysis of the data, but also because we . have carried out an extensive observation programme that lasted for . seven years. La Silla in Chile, where the astronomers studied the NGC 3766, found in the constellation of Centaurus, for seven years . 'It probably wouldn’t have been possible to get so much observing time on a bigger telescope.' Although the cause of the 0.1% variability in luminosity remains unknown, there is a tantalising clue: some of the stars seem to be rotate incredibly fast. They spin at speeds that are more than half of their critical velocity, which is the threshold where stars become unstable and throw off material into space. 'In those conditions, the fast spin will have an important impact on their internal properties, but we are not able yet to adequately model their light variations,' explains Mowlavi. 'We hope our discovery will encourage specialists to address the issue in the hope of understanding the origin of these mysterious variations.'","The new stars vary their brightness over a fixed period of time - a previously unheard of phenomenon .

Google has been shamed into donating £1million to the fight against internet child abuse images following the revelation that it had previously only given the equivalent of 90 seconds’ profit to the cause. The internet giant announced that it would give the money over the next four years to the Internet Watch Foundation, a charity which seeks to police illegal images online. The money will enable the Cambridge-based watchdog to more than double its number of staff to nine full-time ‘internet content analysts’ and one part-time. Google's £1million donation to to the fight against internet child abuse images was welcomed by the government as a 'first step' to tackling the problem . Google acted after the revelation last . week that, despite making great play of its support for the IWF, it . donated just £20,000 a year. Its new donation is worth £250,000 a year - . more than ten times as much. Critics last night said that though . the larger amount was welcome, it was still a drop in the ocean compared . to the firm’s UK profits - and was nothing when set alongside the huge . amounts of tax it was dodging. In 2011, Google paid just £6million in . corporation tax, despite sales worth £3.2billion. Tonight the government welcomed the donation - but said it was only ‘a first step’. The donation emerged as Labour held a . debate in the Commons, urging the government to take tougher action to . protect children from accessing porn online, and to help crack down on . the child abuse images on the net. They called on ministers to bring in . new laws to ‘set a timetable for the introduction of safe search as a . default’ setting for internet search engines, effective age verification . checks on pornographic sites, and ‘splash page warnings’, which will . flash a warning that a web surfer is about to visit a child porn site. Conservative MPs refused to support . the motion and it was defeated by more than 50 votes. But culture . minister Ed Vaizey did say that if internet firms failed to act, . legislation could follow. During the debate, Anne Coffey, Labour . MP for Stockport, criticised Google for its failure to take decent . action to protect children. ‘Google is one of the biggest hosts of . child sexual abuse images, albeit inadvertently, and it should . therefore accept the major responsibility for proactively monitoring and . removing those images,’ she told MPs. ‘If Google spent as much money on . monitoring and removing illegal child sexual abuse images as it does on . paying accountants to avoid tax in the UK, it might go some way towards . living up to its motto, “Don’t be evil”?’ Google had previously donated just £20,000 to the charity - equivalent to 90 seconds' profit . Web companies are under increased . scrutiny following the conviction of Mark Bridger, who was jailed for . life for the murder of five-year-old April Jones. He had collected a . ‘library’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on Google . and Bing in the weeks before the abduction. Both he and Stuart Hazell, who . murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, had no previous convictions for sexual . offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the internet to . committing child murder. The Internet Watch Foundation has been . under increasing pressure in recent years. Last year, reports of child . abuse sites soared by 40 per cent compared with the year before, to . 40,000 - or 150 a day. Chief executive Susie Hargreaves . welcomed the extra money, which she said was almost the equivalent of a . whole year’s running costs for the IWF. ‘This is an incredibly generous donation and Google is demonstrating moral leadership in the field,’ she said. ‘This contribution will significantly . boost our work to meet our vision eliminating online child sexual abuse . content. We are experts at doing this and like any organisation we can . do more, with more resource’. Scott Rubin, of Google, said: ‘We have . a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content.

Tablet computers hit unprecedented heights of popularity as Christmas gifts this year - but Apple's iPad is no longer the top dog, according to analysts. Sales of tablets soared nearly threefold this year, with a total of 7.6million units shipped to Britain in the first three quarters of 2013, and a similar number expected to be sold in the Christmas period. But customers may be turning away from the iPad, as a host of much cheaper competitors launched on the market this year. Falling behind? The iPad no longer accounts for a majority of all tablets sold in the UK . Tablets first hit the mainstream in 2010 when the launch of the iPad heralded a lightweight alternative to laptop and desktop computers. Their sales have continued to rise sharply year on year ever since, with data from analysts IDC showing a 192 per cent rise in the number of units shipped from January to September this year. The iPad was the single most popular device, taking 38 per cent of the market - but for the first time, tablets powered by Google's Android operating system outsold those running Apple's iOS. 56 per cent of tablets sold in Britain run on Android, including popular models such as the Nexus, Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy. The Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire are both available for less than £200, compared to a minimum of £320 for the iPad Mini and £400 for the iPad Air. Speeding ahead: The Kindle Fire, pictured being launched by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, is much cheaper . Nearly 400million apps were . downloaded onto smartphones and tablets yesterday thanks to the . popularity of mobile devices as Christmas presents. Market . analysts Forrester said that December is the peak time for purchases of . electronics, and many people's first instinct is to download as many . apps as possible onto their new device. Software . firms released new apps or updated versions of their old apps in time . for Christmas in a bid to take advantage of the boom. Some . companies engaged in more aggressive tactics - Amazon gave away £40 . worth of apps to every Kindle Fire user as part of a Christmas . promotion. However, the tablet market has been rocked in recent weeks with the release of even cheaper models by British retailers not normally thought of as tech giants. Tesco is selling the Hudl for just £119, in a bid to attract customers who might normally shun tablets as a pricey luxury. Budget supermarket Aldi went even further with the Lifetab, which sold out within hours of going on sale for £80. The rise of ultra-cheap tablets has made parents more likely to give the computers as gifts to their children, according to IDC's Francisco Jeronimo. 'Parents looking to give gifts to children and teenagers are unlikely to spend £400-500 on a tablet, so tablets sub-£100 are less of an investment and more of an attractive disposable gift that doesn't matter so much if it gets broken,' he told the Guardian. And as the technology which powers tablets continues to get cheaper, budget devices are set to become even more common, the analyst said. The rise of cheaper competitors forced Apple to introduce the iPad Mini last year, and the firm could feel compelled to introduce even more downmarket alternatives to maintain its dominant position.","Sales of tablet computers trebled this year, according to analysts .

A young girl with terminal cancer has passed away after her plight gained national attention. Delaney 'Laney' Brown of West Reading, Pennsylvania passed away early Christmas morning. One of the last kind gifts she received was the support of thousands of strangers who came to her front lawn to sing Christmas carols on Saturday night. That pick-me-up came the day after she knocked another dream- speaking with Taylor Swift- off her bucket list on her eighth birthday. Scroll down for video . Last picture: Laney's mother and father were by her side when she passed away at home in West Reading, Pennsylvania just after 3am on Christmas morning . Laney died early Wednesday morning with her relatives updating her followers with her status on the 'Team Laney' Facebook page. 'My heart breaks right now. Our little angel on earth earned her pink glittery angel wings in heaven. She took her last breath at home in her bed at 3:10 surrounded by all her family and friends. I miss her so much already,' the latest update from about 5am on Christmas morning read. Followers were well aware that Laney's health had taken a turn for the worse, with a lengthy update on Tuesday night telling how the family was praying for a Christmas miracle. They had a check in with their doctors Tuesday night so that she could have a transfusion and new tests. 'We went up there hoping that maybe we would get a miracle and were just devastated hearing all those results,' the update read. Last wish: Thousands gathered Saturday evening outside the West Reading, Pennsylvania home of 8-year-old Delaney Brown, who is dying from a rare form of cancer . Touching: Over 4,000 people said they'd attend Delaney's sing-along and photos show a huge crowd outside the ailing 8-year-old's Pennsylvania home . 'I can hear you now!!!

Brave: The brave little girl has remained upbeat, her parents say, and was even courageous enough to mark off another wish from her list--to pet an alligator . Laney received her cancer diagnosis in May but the past week has been the toughest after doctors told the family that there was little else to be done. ‘Today . we were told the worst news of our lives,’ wrote Delaney’s mom Jennifer . Brown last week. ‘Laney has 70% cancer cells in her blood. If they . would treat the cancer the virus that she has would kill her.

Tomorrow, Tower Hamlets council is expected to give the green light for developers to build a 784ft skyscraper on Canary Wharf which is being dubbed a 'town in a tower'. Over 75 floors, the building will contain 822 homes as well as shops, a gym, a library, play and party areas, a cinema and a roof terrace. The facilities will be split between 'amenity floors' located on the 27th and and 56th floors. In their application, developer Chalegrove . Properties, argues this will compensate for a lack of outdoor space for . residents. Landmark: The new skyscraper, highlight right, will become the second-tallest building in Britain at 784ft tall . Living the high life: At the base of the tower there will be a cafe and play area for toddlers and a green space overlooking the River Thames . When the outdoors comes in: The building will include 'amenities' such as this children's play area to compensate for a lack of available outside space . Built on the site of an old pub, the City Pride, the tower will become the second-tallest building in Britain behind the Shard which stands at 1,016ft. It has been designed by top London architects Squire & Partners. Officers have recommended that Tower Hamlet's planning committee gives the project on Westferry Road the go-ahead on the basis that £4.2million is contributed to community services. Almost 40 per cent of the properties must also be reserved for the area's low-income buyers. The Mayor of London Boris Johnson, wrote recently that the shortage of affordable housing in the capital is ‘perhaps the gravest crisis the city faces’. In a document he penned about the future of the capital, he called for restrictions on London councils to borrow to be lifted so they could build more homes. Development: The new skyscraper will be built on the site of a derelict pub on Westferry Road on Canary Wharf . 'There is no need for this to appear on the books as public borrowing,' he said in his 11,000-word paper 'Ambitions for London'. He estimated another 1 million homes will have to be built by the mid-2030s if London is to cope with demographic projections. Mr Johnson added: 'Already 70 per cent of businesses say that the cost of housing in London is a major barrier to growth.' 'To address this crisis we need to act urgently and boldly.' Earlier this year architects released plans to turn disused garages in Dalston, East London, into mini-homes which could be used by young professionals for just £11 a week. If it is successful, the scheme will . be expanded to other parts of London and throughout the UK, . concentrating on areas where there are lots of homeless people or a . shortage of housing for the young. The architects are already in talks with a number of local authorities in hope of launching similar schemes.","Building will become second-tallest in Britain behind the Shard .

Hospital doctors who perform badly will be able to opt out of league tables that are designed to improve transparency in the NHS. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today vowed to name and shame health service staff who refuse to reveal data of their track record. He said there was 'no valid reason' why consultants should not make their figures available. Unpublished records: Hospital doctors who perform badly will be able to opt out of league tables designed to improve transparency in the NHS (file picture) The move came after it emerged doctors could opt to be be left off the league tables, with no indication they withheld their consent. A senior Whitehall source said the loophole undermined transparency and was ‘farcical’. ‘The medical establishment has closed ranks to stop patients telling the truth,’ said the source. ‘This is tantamount to schools being able to stop the release of information about their pupils’ exams results.’ The league table idea has been championed by the Conservatives since 2009, but has yet to be introduced. Transparency: The tables are part of a policy by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to allow patients to pick which doctors they want to be treated by . They are part of a policy by Mr Hunt to allow patients to pick which doctors they wish to be treated by based on their performance. Officials are drawing up plans to publish the death rates of NHS doctors as early as next month, and subject to legal requirements, Mr Hunt wants every consultant to be 'obliged' to disclose the details. Those that refuse will be named and shamed. Mr Hunt said: 'Subject to proper risk adjustment of the data there can be no valid reason why it should not be published - and the majority of consultants strongly support the case for doing so. 'In an era of public concern over patient safety issues at Mid Staffordshire Hospital, this will be a major step forward in restoring public confidence.' Information about how well patients recover following surgery or treatment is set to be published publicly to give the public the choice to use the best health professionals and drive up standards. However, doctors can opt out on the grounds of data privacy. The move seeks to replicate the move four years ago to publish data on the performance of heart surgeons. Public patient survival rates were said to have dramatically improved after previously restricted data was made available. However, a spokesman for NHS England yesterday said there was still ‘some way to go’ before the organisation is sufficiently transparent. ‘Around 96 per cent of consultants across ten specialties who have responded have opted in to the publication of data about their performance, which patients should have the right to see,’ he said. ‘We urge all consultants to think very carefully about the effect on their patients and their colleagues if they choose to opt out on the basis of legislation designed to protect personal data. ‘The publication of consultant-level data for ten surgical specialties heralds a new level of openness, but there is some way to go before the NHS is as transparent as it should be. ‘Information about how individual consultants perform helps them improve as clinicians and give better patient care. League table: Information about how well patients recover following surgery or treatment is set to be published publicly to give the public the choice to use the best health professionals and drive up standards . 'This has been clear since the first publication of data on cardiac consultants’ performance a decade ago, which resulted in heart surgery survival going from below the European average to amongst the best. ‘The experience with the publication of cardiac data strongly suggests that consultant surgeons who do feel uncomfortable quickly come on board when they see the enormous benefits publication brings to their patients and to themselves.’ A Department for Health spokesman said: ‘If there are legal grounds for individual doctors opting out, any patient and their family would be entitled to ask why and may prefer their operation to be carried out by someone who was prepared to be fully transparent.’ A spokesman for the Royal College of Surgeons said it was a ‘watershed moment’ and urged doctors to take part.

Neil Davey, 51, has lost his appeal against record £125,000 fine for felling a protected tree in his neighbour's garden in Parkstone, Dorset . A wealthy homeowner who felled a neighbour’s tree that was blocking sea views from his hot tub has lost an appeal against the record fine imposed on him. Neil Davey arranged to have the protected 40ft maritime pine tree axed while he and his wife Sheena were on their honeymoon in Paris in 2010. On their return, the 51-year-old surprised his bride with her wedding present - unobstructed views of Poole Harbour, Dorset, from their sun terrace. The enhanced views increased the value of the Daveys' large detached home in Parkstone from £725,000 to £775,000. At Bournemouth Crown Court last November, Davey was found guilty of arranging to have the 55-year-old tree felled and was ordered by a court to pay out £50,000 to make up the difference in his property's value. He was also fined £75,000 fine, a record for the offence of destroying a protected tree, and ordered to pay court costs of £14,500. Davey, who owns an auction house, launched an appeal but rather than quash his sentence, a Court of Appeal judge today upheld the earlier ruling, and ordered him to pay an extra £2,021 to cover costs. Lord Justice Patrick Elias described Davey’s act as 'cynical', and said the substantial fine reflected the fact that the crime was one of the most serious of its kind. Following the hearing Poole council’s planning enforcement officer, Andy Dearing, said: 'The council is pleased with the Court of Appeal’s decision upholding Davey’s conviction and fine. 'The fine, financial penalty and costs are a clear message to anyone contemplating such an act that the overall cost and reputational damage outweigh any gain, whether it is for a view or a planning advantage.' Neighbour Steve Bransgrove said the noise of a revving chainsaw woke him up and he ran outside to see the felled tree . An aerial shot showing how the felling of the 55-year-old tree improved the view from Neil Davey's house in Dorset . At his trial, Bournemouth Crown Court had heard Davey had 'paid or otherwise arranged' for friend Thomas McGuire, a tree surgeon, to take a chainsaw to the tree while he was away. McGuire, 34, snuck into the garden under the cover of darkness and chopped down the 55-year-old tree. Davey's neighbour Steve Bransgrove, on whose property the protected tree stood, was woken by the revving of a chainsaw in the early hours of June 20, 2010. He raced outside to see that the perfectly healthy tree had crashed down close to a building, but McGuire had fled. Tree surgeon Thomas McGuire, left,  was asked to cut down the perfectly healthy tree by auctioneer Neil Davey . After the verdict in the court case last year, judge Peter Johnson told auction house owner Davey: 'This was a pre-meditated matter, not something that occurred on the spur of the moment. 'What you orchestrated demonstrated a remarkable arrogance. 'In order to improve your view you arranged for your co-accused to go around to the tree in the dead of night and cut it down, putting your neighbours’ lives at risk.' McGuire was fined a total of £5,515 for his part in the scheme. Davey had denied causing or permitting . the destruction of a tree and McGuire, from Bournemouth, pleaded not . guilty to the willful destruction of a tree. Once the tree was felled, it offered a perfect view over Poole Harbour from Neil Davey's Parkstone home . Tree preservation orders (TPOs) exist to protect specific trees which bring a 'specific amenity benefit' to a local area. They can be made to protect any type of tree, by the local planning authority, and they make it an offence to cut down, damage, top, lop or wilfully destroy the tree in question. TPOs do not automatically cover any one species of tree, nor do they cover bushes, hedges or shrubs. Neil Davey arranged for a maritime pine tree like this one, pictured, to be felled by a professional tree surgeon . Owners of protected trees are still responsible for the tree, but the local authority's permission is usually needed if any work is to be done to the tree. In recent years there have been spates of people damaging or cutting down protected trees to enhance the views from their properties. Authorities in Poole, near Neil Davey's home in Parkstone, have reported several attacks on protected trees around the exclusive harbour area. They investigated incidents including a 100-year-old protected oak having its top lopped off, and a resident pouring cleaning fluid onto another tree in an attempt to poison it. But they said such incidents rarely ended in a prosecution because of a lack of hard evidence.","Neil Davey, 51,arranged to have tree cut down as wedding present for wife .

The first complete chemical analysis of feathers from Archaeopteryx, a famous fossil that shows the incredible link between dinosaurs and birds, has found its feathers were actually patterned and light in colour, with a dark edge and tip to the feather - rather than all black, as previously thought . The findings came from X-ray experiments by a team from The University of Manchester, working with colleagues at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The scientists were able to find chemical traces of the original ‘dinobird’ and dilute traces of plumage pigments in the 150 million-year-old fossil. 'This is a big leap forward in our understanding of the evolution of plumage and also the preservation of feathers,' said Dr Phil Manning, a palaeontologist at The University of Manchester and lead author of the report in the June 13 issue of the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry (Royal Society of Chemistry).

The new chemical tests have allowed scientists to peer into the past and given them an insight into what the ancient species would have looked like - a feat previously thought impossible. Only 11 specimens of Archaeopteryx have been found, the first one consisting of a single feather. Until a few years ago, researchers thought minerals would have replaced all the bones and tissues of the original animal during fossilisation, leaving no chemical traces behind, but two recently developed methods have turned up more information about the dinobird and its plumage. The 150 million-year-old fossilised feather has shed new light on nature's earliest complex patterns . The first is the discovery of melanosomes – microscopic ‘biological paint pot’ structures in which pigment was once made, but are still visible in some rare fossil feathers. A team led by researchers at Brown University announced last year that an analysis of melanosomes in the single Archaeopteryx feather indicated it was black. They identified the feather as a covert – a type of feather that covers the primary and secondary wing feathers – and said its heavy pigmentation may have strengthened it against the wear and tear of flight, as it does in modern birds. Over the past three years, the team used this method to discover chemical traces locked in the dinobird’s bones, feathers and in the surrounding rock, as well as pigments from the fossilised feathers of two specimens of another species of early bird. This allowed the team to recreate the plumage pattern of an extinct bird for the very first time. In the latest study, the team scanned the entire fossil of the first Archaeopteryx feather with the SSRL X-ray beam. They found trace-metals that have been shown to be associated with pigment and organic sulphur compounds that could only have come from the animal’s original feathers. 'The fact that these compounds have been preserved in-place for 150 million years is extraordinary,' said Dr Manning. 'Together, these chemical traces show that the feather was light in colour with areas of darker pigment along one edge and on the tip. Scans of a second fossilised Archaeopteryx, known as the Berlin counterpart, also show that the trace-metal inventory supported the same plumage pigmentation pattern.' Co-author Dr Roy Wogelius, also based in Manchester’s School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, said: 'This work refines our understanding of pigment patterning in perhaps the most important known fossil. Our technique shows that complex patterns were present even at the very earliest steps in the evolution of birds.' Dr Manning added: 'It is remarkable that x-rays brighter than a million suns can shed new light on our understanding of the processes that have locked elements in place for such vast periods of time. Ultimately, this research might help inform scientists on the mechanisms acting during long-term burial, from animal remains to hazardous waste. The fossil record has potential to provide the experimental hindsight required in such studies.'

With their historic mansions and quaint tea shops - National Trust venues seem like the perfect family day out. But the charity has its eye on a rather different audience - as it prepares to host burlesque nights in stately homes. In a bid to attract younger visitors two racy performances featuring cocktails and scantily-clad dancers will be held, after last year saw a four per cent decline in visitors across the country. The National trust has its eye on a different audience at the Killerton estate in Devon . Vintage: The National Trust hopes hosting burlesque nights will help attract a younger crowd . The trust will seek to change perceptions to give off a less ‘buttoned-up’ impression to younger audiences. To reassure members concerned about the trust sexing up its image, a spokesman said performances would be ‘tasteful’ with dancers ‘showing off their corsets, feathers and pearls’. Organiser Shelley Barns told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It is a family event, so the burlesque dancers will be quite tame. ‘It is supposed to be a bit light-hearted. They won’t be getting completely naked, let’s put it that way. This is the ﬁrst time they have performed anywhere like this.’ Felicity Boucher, a visitor services ofﬁcer for the trust, said: ‘We’ve never tried anything like this before but with the backdrop of the house and garden it seemed like the perfect setting for an evening of cocktails and nostalgic appeal.’ The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes. One of the reasons for the turn to burlesque nights is the fact that there was a four per cent decline in the number of visitors to National Trust properties across the country last year . Two models pose on a vintage car. The trust hopes to give off a less 'buttoned-up' impression of its properties . The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes . Performers will include Kitty’s Dolls Burlesque and singer Lola Lamour, with adult tickets costing £18.50. The second will be at at Trelissick Garden Cornwall, featuring The Slinky Minkys whose dancers include Babalicious, Miss Pip Tease and Miss Guilty Pleasure. Last year it was reported the organisation - of which Prince Charles is president — was launching an X-rated digital guide to London’s red-light district. It was a far cry from the Trust’s mantra ‘to preserve and protect historic places and spaces’. Former Tory Prisons Minister Ann Widdecombe, said she was appalled by the charitable body’s attempt to update its image. She said: ‘I fail to understand how getting young people to listen to these stories of Soho relates in any way to the important and historic work of the National Trust.’ ‘In fact if this is the National Trust’s idea of attracting new members, I suggest they go for a brisk walk in the countryside to clear their brains and recover their senses.’ The National Trust events may raise an eyebrow among some traditional members who have previously also voiced concerns over the organisation’s so-called ‘Disneyfication’ drive. This is where the organisation  has attempted to make its properties more appealing to younger visitors with innovations such as guides dressed in period costumes and interactive displays.","Charity to host racy performances at 18th Century Killerton House in Devon .

This terraced family home is believed to be the cheapest in the UK - and it could be sold for as little as 10p. The three-bedroom house in Port Clarence, Teesside, has a guide price of just £750, and yet is ready to move in to straight away with a working bathroom and kitchen. As it has no reserve price, the property in Limetrees Close could go for no more than a few pence when it is auctioned off tonight. On sale: The house with the green door in this image could be sold for as little as 10p tonight . Neighbourhood: The house is in Port Clarence, Teesside, a post-industrial town near Middlesborough . A number of other homes have previously been dubbed Britain's cheapest, but most have not actually been inhabitable without a total renovation. However, while the buyer of this house can move in immediately, he or she will have to do a certain amount of work - the windows have been boarded up and the garden is totally overgrown. Experts say that after renovation the property, situated in a deprived area of the port town, could be worth more than £25,000. The home consists of an entrance hall, three bedrooms, family bathroom and a large lounge. Decent shape: The home could do with a lick of paint, but is hardly looking delapidated . Kitchen: It may be missing some utilities, but there are the facilities to cook up a simple family meal . Sparse: The new owner will have some work to do to stamp his or her personality on the property . 'This is a total bargain,' said Jordan Smith of auctioneer iam-sold. 'I am not aware of any properties in the UK that have a lower guide price than this. 'As it has no reserve, technically the house could sell for as little as a few pounds. 'It doesn't even need much work, I have been told that a few thousand would be sufficient to get it up to scratch. Bathroom: The washing facilities certainly belie the £750 guide price for the terraced home . Well-lit: But it remains to be seen how popular the property will prove at auction . Bargain? Although the property certainly needs a lot of work, it is inhabitable straight away . 'The owner is keen for a quick sale but we are hoping that when it goes under the hammer, bidders will bring in a decent price. 'Potentially it could make a nice family home. It's not the best area, but we have had interest from people hoping to move in straight away, those who would like to rent it out, and some who hope to renovate it and make a profit.' Last October, two other Port Clarence homes sold for a combined total of less than £25,000. Both three-bedroom properties were located on Limetrees Close, and went for £14,000 and £10,500. Cheap move: The one-bedroom flat in Hartlepool, County Durham with an auction price of just £2,500 . A two-bedroom home in Burnley, . Lancashire was labelled the cheapest house in Britain in April, on sale . with a starting price of just £1,000. The . property was so dilapidated that it would have taken thousands of . pounds to make it liveable. Estate agents marketing the house admitted . the home was 'in need of complete refurbishment'. Another of Britain's cheapest homes went to auction in February with a starting price of just £2,500 (right). Estate . agents admitted the one-bedroom flat in Hartlepool, County Durham, was . in a 'distressed' state, but said the first-floor apartment could make . an ideal first home with lots of DIY.

Earlier this week, an even cheaper house appeared on the market - auctioneers listed a home in the old mining village on Nantymoel, South Wales for free. However, that property hardly counts as a home - the sellers admitted it was 'unfit for human habitation' and described it as 'little more than a shell requiring complete renovation'.","Three-bedroom house in Port Clarence goes under the hammer for £750 .

The immigrant grandfather who won the $338 million Powerball jackpot has revealed that he will buy his wife 'whatever she wants' with the money. Pedro Quezada, 44, appeared at a New Jersey Lottery press conference in Lawrenceville on Tuesday afternoon to talk about his shock at the massive payout, and what he intends to do with it. Mr Quezada, who moved from the Dominican Republic 26 years ago, was joined by his wife Ines Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant, at the podium and spoke through a translator to address the media. 'I will help those in need,' he vowed in Spanish, adding that he was planning on buying 'a good car - the one I like'. Joy: Pedro Quezada, the winner of the Powerball jackpot, talks to the media during a news conference . He said he would no longer be working at the bodega he has owned in Passaic, New Jersey for seven years, and will insist that his 23-year-old son, who runs the store, will quit the job as well. 'With all those millions, would you allow your children to work in a store like that?' he said. Mr Quezada, who has another son, 15, and three daughters, aged five, 10 and 17, joked that he would continue to pay the lottery despite his huge winnings. But he said he was also wary of people around him who may want to take advantage of his new-found riches, and declined to give the name of his hometown in the Dominican Republic. Winners: He was joined by his wife Ines Sanchez, center, to talk about their plans for spending the money . Excitement: He said his wife, who is a Mexican immigrant, could have 'whatever she wants' with the money . Kind-hearted: Quezada said he has not decided on the specifics, but hopes to help people in need . 'You have to be careful, some people aren't good people,' he said. '[My life] has to change because it's so much money, but it will not change my heart.' He was vague about where he plans to go next, but said he might buy property in New Jersey, the Dominican Republic or Mexico. Mr Quezada, who has lived in Passaic since moving to the U.S. as a teenager, also detailed the moment he discovered he had the winning ticket. He had previously been caught celebrating on camera after learning about his win at Eagle Liquors. 'The store is located on the way to my . deli store so when i saw the commotion outside I figured maybe the . winning ticket was purchased there, so that's why i stopped,' he said. 'When the gentleman checked, he said, ""Congratulations"".' Only when he saw himself and his wife on television did he realise it was real, he said. His . wife, to whom he has been married for nine years, said she thought her . 'heart wanted to come out of my chest' when her husband called her with . the news. 'I had no words,' she said. 'All I can say is I feel very happy because God has blessed us with this prize.' If . Mr Quezada takes the winnings as a lump sum, it will come to $152 . million after taxes. Federal tax is 25 per cent of the payout, and the . state gets another six per cent. The moment of discovery was captured by the swarms of media gathering in the store. 'We . won! We won! We're not gonna be poor anymore!' he told his mother as he . spoke on the phone in Spanish after discovering the massive win, the New York Post reported. 'I can't believe it. I'm overwhelmed. I was praying so much for this,' he added to the Daily News. Celebration: Mr Quezada said he will be quitting work, buying a new car and helping the community . Riches: If he chooses to take a lump-sum payment, Mr Quezada will get $152 million after taxes . Shock: Powerball jackpot winner Pedro Quezada is pictured with his wife, Ines Sanchez, and their daughter after discovering he had won the $338 million prize on Monday . Stunned: The bodega owner and 44-year-old father of five discovered he had the winning ticket in the shop . He said he hopes to help people with the money, and his son said his father will continue to work. 'He's going to stay here doing what he loves to do,' Casiano Quezada told The Star-Ledger. Quezada, who lives in a shabby third-floor apartment on a block next to a highway, began working in a factory after arriving in the U.S. 26 years ago. In . 2006, he opened his own bodega, which is run by his son Casiano, 23. But he chooses to play the lottery at Eagle Liquors because he never . applied for a license. Casiano . told the Post that he was working at the bodega when his father called . with the good news - but that he initially didn't want to close the . store because he didn't want to lose business. Joy: His son, Casiano Quezada, smiles while talking to members of the media inside Apple Deli Grocery . Change ahead: Quezada (pictured with a friend) runs the bodega, which his father has had for seven years . Worker: After the win, the younger Quezada didn't want to shut the store because of losing business . Devoted: Casiano Quezada closes early on Tuesday. He said his father will continue working despite his win . Neighbours . added that the family, including Quezada's wife of 10 years, Ines . Sanchez, were rarely seen, and they assumed it was because they worked . so much. Eladia Vazquez, who has lived across the . street from Quezada for the past 25 years, described the coupe as 'quiet and not overly . talkative' but sensed that they seemed to be working all the time. 'This is super for all of us on this block,' she said. 'They deserve it because they are hardworking people.' Quezada's wife Ines added: 'We're hardworking people. We always struggled.' Quezada said he had not yet decided what to do with the money but knows 'I'm going to help a lot of people, whatever they need'. He has three daughters, aged five, 17 . and 10, and two sons, a 15-year-old and 23-year-old Casiano. He also has . five brothers and two sisters. Joy: His wife, Ines Sanchez, spoke in Spanish as she told media they hope to help others with the money . Life-changing: Quezada is pictured on the phone to relatives as he shouts that he's a millionaire . Ecstatic: He is pictured running from the store after discovering he has just won $338 million . He has been given about 10 liens totaling more than $25,000 between 1998 and 2011. He . learned of his mega win after going to Eagle Liquors. One sister, Paula .

Tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes as the River Elbe burst through a dam and flooded parts of eastern Germany. Today the Elbe breached another levee on its relentless march towards the North Sea, forcing Germany to evacuate ten villages and close one of the country's main railway routes. Upstream there was some relief as the river slipped back from record levels in Magdeburg, the capital of Saxony-Anhalt state. At least 21 flood-related deaths have been in reported in central Europe following a week of heavy rain, leading to rivers swelling and extensive damage. Scroll down for video .

Magdeburg had water levels more than 16ft above normal over the weekend, although the Elbe has now retreated by about a foot. More than 23,000 people had to leave their homes in the city when the electricity was cut off and streets flooded. But further downstream, a levee at Fischbeck, west of Berlin, was breached overnight, prompting officials to evacuate ten villages in the area. Germany's national railway had to close a bridge near Fischbeck on the line from Berlin to Cologne, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Residents in the Rothensee neighbourhood of Magdeburg were evacuated with tanks, trucks and buses. 'Rothensee is filling up like a bathtub,' army spokesman Andre Sabzog told news agency dpa. Around 700 soldiers were trying to build a dam of sandbags around a power substation to protect it from the Elbe. Sandbags did little to stop the advancing water in Rothensee district . At least 21 flood-related deaths have been reported in central Europe following a week of heavy rain . Volunteers tried to protect Magdeburg from the Elbe with sandbags .

Further north on the Elbe river, . residents were trying to protect themselves from flooding by building . levees along the banks of the rising waterway. Officials in Saxony-Anhalt state also were investigating what appeared to be a threat to destroy dams. Several . media outlets said they had received a letter threatening to blow up . dams on the Elbe river, Holger Stahlknecht, the state's interior . minister, said Sunday.

Clare Bache at her home and her children Katrina, Jasmine, Luke, Anthony, Hughey and Charlie . Mrs Bache, 38, says the reforms will . mean she has to give up the six-bedroom rented house paid for the . taxpayer and find somewhere cheaper. ‘It is incredibly stressful,’ she said. ‘I feel like there’s a dark cloud hovering over us and the future looks very bleak.’ She currently receives around £31,200 a . year – £2,600 a month – through a combination of housing benefit, child . benefit, child tax credits and income support. All of it, she says, goes on her seven . children: Charlotte 17, Katrina 15, Jasmine, 12, ten-year-old Luke, . Anthony, eight, Huey, six, and Charlie Ali, two. Hardship: Ms Bache, who lives in a six-bedroom privately rented home with her children, says her life will become 'impossible' on capped benefits . For a taxpayer to take . home £31,200 a year, he or she would have to earn a salary of more than . £42,000. Mrs Bache’s home was repossessed five . years ago and, having failed to secure a council house, she has been . paying £725 a month to a landlord. She says the benefit changes mean she . may have to move home, ‘shop around’ for better deals on her bills, get . rid of her car and stop buying all her food at the supermarket. Two of her children have medical problems which, she says, means she needs her car to take them to doctor’s appointments. Karina has arthritis and Charlie has been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, which affects the body’s nervous system. Clare Bache's current benefits per month, ahead of the cap due this summer: . Housing benefit: £715 . Child benefit: £377 . Child tax credit: £1,252 . Income support: £303 . Total: £2,647 . While she is still in touch with her . estranged husband, Wayne Bache, father of her six eldest children, she . claims he only gives her ‘the odd fiver, but that’s it’.Mrs Bache, who . is in an ‘on and off relationship’ with the father of her youngest . child, said the benefits cap will make her life impossible. ‘I’ve sought advice and been told that . my only choice will be to declare myself homeless,’ she added. ‘It’s . incredibly stressful. Gas and electricity bills already cripple me and I . just don’t know how I will cope. I will have to shop around. I won’t be . able to get all my groceries from a supermarket because it will cost . too much.’ Mrs Bache said sending her children to school was a burden because she had to find £500 a year for uniforms. ‘I won’t be able to afford school trips for them any more, it’s going to be impossible,’ she added. The single mother’s comments were met with fierce criticism from those who support changes to the benefit system. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Working families have to make decisions based on what they can afford. ‘There is no reason that should be different when taxpayers are picking up the bill.’ The Government’s benefit cap limits . the amount a household can claim in welfare to £26,000 a year. It does . not affect those on disability benefits or anyone working more than 16 . hours a week and claiming working tax credits. The cap limits will be set at £500 a . week for couples, with or without children, and lone parent households . and at £350 a week for households of a single adult with no children.

But England also fares badly in a European league table of premature mortality in 17 countries in 2010. Women . in England have the third worst rate - with only Belgium and Denmark . doing more badly - and men are seventh for avoidable deaths, according . to data released earlier this year. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said . ‘This shocking variation in early and unnecessary deaths means people’s . lives are needlessly cut short and that cannot continue unchecked. ‘I want areas to use the data . released today to identify local public health challenges like smoking, . drinking and obesity and to take action to help achieve our ambition for . saving 30,000 lives a year by 2020.’ The new Longer Lives league table . website from Public Health England ranks 150 local authorities using a . traffic light system, ranging from red for the worst areas to green for . the best. It says there are 103,000 avoidable . early deaths in England each year, with four major killers including . heart disease and cancer responsible for 75 per cent of those deaths. Manchester (pictured) tops the league of premature deaths where there were 455 premature deaths per 100,000 people . In . Manchester, there were 455 premature deaths per 100,000 people from . 2009 to 2011 - more than twice as many as the best performing area of . Wokingham with 200 such deaths in the same period. Manchester . has the highest death rate from cancer in the country, with 152 deaths . per 100,000 people recorded, as well as from heart disease and stroke, . with 116 deaths per 100,000 people. But Blackpool has the highest rates for liver and lung disease, with 39 and 62 premature deaths per 100,000 in that time. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said . ‘This shocking variation in early and unnecessary deaths means people’s . lives are needlessly cut short and that cannot continue unchecked. ‘I . want areas to use the data released today to identify local public . health challenges like smoking, drinking and obesity and to take action . to help achieve our ambition for saving 30,000 lives a year by 2020.’ The . new Longer Lives league table website from Public Health England ranks . 150 local authorities using a traffic light system, ranging from red for . the worst areas to green for the best. The best performing area to live out a long life was Wokingham in Berkshire .

England is seventh out of 17 European countries for men and 15th for women. Professor . John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said . health inequalities in England should be tackled urgently. He said ‘The message for local authorities is that there are a large number of people dying before they should and that there are things that can be done.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the shocking variation in early and unnecessary deaths means people's lives are being cut short . However, recent figures suggest the situation is improving, with overall premature death rates coming down, he added. Prof Newton said ‘What we are doing is providing information that is hard hitting and sometimes challenging but is presented in a form that is accessible and easy to understand.’ The website classifies areas with similar levels of deprivation so local authorities can see how they compare. The peer ranking shows Rotherham and Redcar and Cleveland are doing well among the most deprived areas, while Bracknell in Berkshire and Central Bedfordshire have some of the highest rates of early death in the least deprived areas. Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE’s director of health and wellbeing, said he hoped the site would spark a national debate on tackling premature deaths - rather than worry those living in areas given a red traffic light rating. Under the NHS reforms, local councils have been given new responsibilities to enhance public health in their catchment areas. The new website aims to give them information about the current situation in their region so health funding can be spent where it is most needed, said Public Health England. Councillor Zoe Patrick, chairwoman of the Local Government Association’s community wellbeing board, said ‘The Longer Lives tool will provide some useful insight into the serious public health challenges facing councils and help us identify local priorities. ‘But this data must be used with caution. Using it out of context to create any sort of national league table dangerously oversimplifies matters and ignores the very complex socio-economic and cultural factors that affect the premature mortality rate.‘ .","The best place to avoid an early death is Wokingham in Berkshire .

Safak Pavey of the opposition CHP party said: 'This is the accumulation of 10 years of insulting people in every way. 'It was just the moment of city people who didn't want to live any more in concrete. 'Every kind of human rights violation has been done on them in that square... it has turned into a clash of cultures, I'm afraid.

He . has also exerted strong pressure on the media, seven newspapers last . week carrying the identical headline citing Erdogan as saying he, not . the protesters, guaranteed democracy.

'We will . continue our measures in an unremitting manner, whether day or night, . until marginal elements are cleared and the square is open to the . people,' Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu declared on television on . Tuesday night. Police were . less in evidence by the morning and it was not clear if protesters would . return in the course of the day, as they have previously.

Gezi Park, a leafy corner of Taksim, triggered the wider protests, . drawing in a broad alliance of secularists, nationalists, professional . workers, unionists and students - some of whom would never before have . considered sharing a political platform.

Erdogan . swept to power in 2002 after forging his AK Party from an alliance of . centrist reformers and nationalists as well as remnants of Islamist . parties banned in the past by secular authorities. Denying any plans to . subvert Turkey's secular order, he set about deep-reaching social . reforms.

They live in rainforests and mangrove forests, preferring high dense canopies they can easily travel across. The creatures are omnivores, eating insects, small birds and reptiles, eggs, fruits and other vegetation. As a defence mechanism lorises will bite aggressors, producing a toxin to infect the wounds. To humans the bites cause a painful swelling, but the toxin is mild and not fatal. The single reported case of human death by loris bite was believed to have resulted from prophylactic shock.

It dates back more than 1,400 years and  is the cornerstone of Welsh culture,  campaigners say. But parents of pupils at primary schools in rural Wales claim their children are being punished by teachers who insist they use only the Welsh language. At one school, they allege, children as young as four were told they could not go to the toilet unless they asked to do so in Welsh, while at another a young pupil was told to ‘move to England’ if she wanted to speak English in the playground.

Councillor Hag Harris, Ceredigion County Council cabinet member for education, said their Welsh strategy is not 'akin' to the website's accusations .

The parents, who have asked to remain anonymous, have set up a campaign group in Ceredigion, a Welsh-speaking stronghold, and made a formal complaint to Keith Towler, Children’s Commissioner for Wales.

A 16-year-old girl was killed while riding on the roof of a vehicle that spun out of control, according to an initial investigation by police. Police say Anna Gabrielle Hawkins of Dawsonville, Georgia was 'car surfing' when the young driver took a turn too quickly and Hawkins was thrown from the roof and onto the concrete below. The driver of the Suzuki Grand Vitara, also 16, was reportedly speeding down a curvy road when the tragedy occurred Monday sometime after 9pm. Tragic: Anna Hawkins, 16, was fatally injured after an SUV she was 'car surfing' atop spun out of control. Hawkins was thrown onto the road where police say she died . 'The vehicle was traveling south on Couch Road and the preliminary report indicates Miss Hawkins was ""car surfing,""' Georgia State Trooper Mark Cox told the Dawson Advertiser. ‘The vehicle entered a right-hand curve too fast and the driver lost control. The vehicle traveled across the northbound lane along the shoulder, hit an embankment, then came back into the roadway, throwing Miss Hawkins off the roof. She hit the pavement and sustained substantial head injuries.’ Cox said Hawkins died at the scene, though she was transported to an area hospital. Police say there is no indication alcohol was involved in the incident. Searching for the cause: An police investigator marks the curvy path the SUV took before Hawkins was ejected. Findings will determine if the driver, also 16 and newly licensed, will face charges . Beloved: Hawkins was captain of the soccer team and a star student. 'She was the best of the best,' said coach Jed Lacey . They are, however, still speaking to the . driver of the vehicle. The girl, described as a good friend of . Hawkins’, was not seriously injured in the accident. It is possible she will face charges. ‘She hadn't had her license very long, and it's still under investigation,’ he said. ‘But the law states you have to have six months' experience before you can transport anyone besides family.’ On Tuesday morning, the Georgia State Police Reconstruction Team was on the scene. Their incident report will be turned over to the Dawson County District Attorney’s office. The findings will determine whether or not charges will be filed against the driver, who described herself to officers at the scene as Hawkins’ best friend. ‘I've heard of car surfing and have seen it in the movies,’ Cox said, ‘but in my 18 years of law enforcement, I've never seen anything like this.’ Car surfing is exactly what it sounds like. As someone drives, the surfer stands or sits atop the hood or on the roof as the vehicle flies down the road. Just this month, a Littleton, Colorado man was badly injured while attempting the stunt. 20-year-old Jeremy Davis is in critical condition after he, too, fell from the car he was attempting to surf June 3. At the site of Hawkins' death on Tuesday were the victim’s mother and other family members, including an aunt who told WSBTV she was shocked her niece would even attempt the dangerous stunt. ‘She was very, very smart. Her SAT scores were very high. She was probably going to get a full-ride scholarship to a college,’ Lynn Burn told the Atlanta station. ‘Anna was a beautiful child. She was at the top of her class. She was a star soccer player. She was voted most valuable player on her soccer team.’ Unbelievable: Hawkins, left, with her parents and sister Kati, right. Family was on the scene Tuesday and found it hard to believe she would choose to try the dangerous stunt . Sad: Hawkins, right, here with her sister Kati. The 16-year-old died while riding atop an SUV driven by a friend that spun out of control. The driver could face charges, but alcohol was not involved. The head soccer coach at Dawson County High Jed Lacey had glowing things to say about the teen, as well. He named her team captain last year. ‘She's the greatest kid I've ever coached in my life,’ he said. ‘She was the heart and soul of our soccer team. She always had a smile on her face. You'd be proud to have her as your daughter. This is a real shocker. I'm in serious pain.’ Police, like Georgia State Trooper Steve Thompson hope this grievous event will keep other young people from making similar choices in the future. Grieving: Hawkins' aunt, Lynn Burn, was in shock. 'Anna was a beautiful child. She was at the top of her class. She was a star soccer player. She was voted most valuable player on her soccer team.' ‘When I see it on YouTube, I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous this is. I beg the teenagers, please stay inside the vehicle and wear their seat belts,’ said Thompson. Funeral arrangements are now being made as family and friends continue to make sense of the tragedy. ‘She was the best of the best,’ Lacey said. Small community: Hawkins with her sister and father. Funeral arrangements are in the works as family and friends in the tight-knit Georgia town of Dawsonville begin to grieve .","Police say the driver of the SUV, also 16, was speeding around a curve when Anna Hawkins may have been thrown from the roof of the vehicle .

The Ku Klux Klan is planning a rally in Memphis in protest at the city's decision to remove the name of one of its founding members from a public park. A faction of the KKK called the 'Loyal White Knights' is angry that Nathan Bedford Forrest park has been renamed, and claims the move is part of a plan to 'erase white people from the history books.' Bedford Forrest was a Confederate general during the American Civil War - and was thought to be the white supremacist organisation's first 'grand wizard.' Opposition: A faction of the Ku Klux Klan is planning a rally in Memphis in protest at the removal of the name of one of its founding members from a city park . The group is calling on other branches of the KKK to join the rally on March 30. Nathan Bedford Forrest Park has been temporarily renamed . Health Sciences Park until a permanent name is selected, the Daily News reports. The city's Confederate Park . and Jefferson Davis Park - named after the former Confederate leader - were all also renamed by the city in February and are now called Memphis Park and Mississippi . River Park, respectively. Legacy: Nathan Bedford Forrest was a skillful Confederate cavalry commander during the Civil War - but was also an early member of the KKK . 'They are renaming the park and also removing his remains,' the Loyal White Knights wrote on its website. 'We are asking all good klans to join us in the fight. The group invited the Northern Mississippi White knights and International Keystone Knights to join it at the rally. The North Carolina White Knight's self-titled 'imperial wizard' Chris Barker, said the decision to change the park's name was an attempt to 'erase white people from the history books,' the Daily News reports. The rally will reportedly be held from 1.30 pm to 4pm outside Memphis's federal courthouse. Meanwhile the city council voted on Tuesday to ban the wearing of masks 'for the purpose of civil rights intimidation.' Acccording to recent census figures the city's population is now more than 60 per cent black. The Memphis president of the National Association for the Advancement . of Colored People (NAACP) has urged residents not to 'give the Klan an . audience,' according to the Guardian. The city council's decision is thought to have been influenced by a state bill that would ban the renaming of military or war memorial parks. Bedford Forrest was a skillful cavalry and military commander during the Civil War, and one of the few men to enlist as a private and rise through the ranks to become a general. He was less well educated than many of his fellow officers, but his innovative approach to military command was celebrated by his contemporaries. However, his reputation was scarred after he was accused of war crimes at the Battle of Fort Pillow for allowing his forces to massacre upon hundreds of black Union Army and white Southern Unionist prisoners. After the war he became an early member of the KKK which had been formed by veterans of the Confederate Army in Pulaski, Tennessee in 1866.","KKK angry that Nathan Bedford Forrest Park is to be renamed .

Police Chief Quigley had said Whitcomb arived at the scene and pulled his daughter from the car ‘without knowing it was her.’ CBS . Boston reported that Hamilton, a mother to three daughters, ages 2, 4 . and 9, was on her way to her parents' house just a mile away from her . own home when the collision happened. On Christmas Day, Katie Hamilton's grieving husband, Liam, woke up their three little girls. 'I tried to make it normal,' he told the Boston Globe. However, the couple's youngest daughter, a 2-year-old, appeared confused and asked where their mommy was. 'Mommy died,' her 4-year-old sister replied. Mr . Hamilton took his girls to their grandparents, Steve Whitcomb and his . wife, just like Katie Hamilton had done the day before - possibly saving . her children's lives. The . 30-year-old woman had dropped off the girls Tuesday morning at her . parents' house on her way to work. She had planned to pick them up later . to run some errands, but her mother convinced her to leave the kids . with her. Katie Hamilton never returned for her girls. Liam . Hamilton, who married Katie in 2008, said that his wife and her father . were very close. The two had been working together in plumbing since . Katie was a teenager. Tragic: Mr Whitcomb, who owns a local heating and cooling business, is a longtime volunteer firefighter in the small town of Brookline. Katie, right, recently celebrated her 30th birthday with her family . The crash involved three cars. The other two drivers in the crash were not injured . ‘You grieve and then you try to put it all back together,’ the heartbroken dad told the Nashua Telegraph. Mr Whitcomb described his daughter as an outspoken person who never hesitated to say what was on her mind. Fire Chief Charles Corey said Hamilton was a major supporter of the local fire department, often bringing food to fire scenes for the volunteers and organizing fundraisers.","Katie Hamilton, 30, of Brookline, New Hampshire was pulled from the wreckage of her car around 9am .

Home operation: Grace Adeleye carried out the procedure on four-week-old baby Goodluck Caubergs using only a pair of scissors, forceps and olive oil . A nurse has been found guilty of the manslaughter of a four-week-old baby who bled to death after a botched home circumcision. Goodluck Caubergs died the day after Grace Adeleye carried out the procedure without anaesthetic, using only a pair of scissors, forceps and olive oil, a trial at Manchester Crown Court heard. The 67-year-old is originally from Nigeria, as are the youngster’s parents, where the circumcision of newborns is a tradition for Christian families, the jury heard. Adeleye, who is also a midwife, was paid £100 for the operation as Goodluck’s parents were not aware the procedure was available on the NHS. The Royal Oldham Hospital was just a mile and a half from the family home in Chadderton, near Oldham, but by the time an ambulance was called the infant could not be saved, the court heard. A jury of eight women and four men found Adeleye guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence by a majority verdict of 10 to 2 after deliberating for eight hours and 20 minutes. Jane Wragg, specialist prosecutor in the CPS Special Crime Division, said: 'Goodluck Caubergs was a healthy little boy whose tragic death was wholly unnecessary. 'This case was not about the rights or wrongs of circumcision, but the grossly negligent way in which the procedure was undertaken. Circumcision is a medical procedure which, like any other, carries very real risks to the patient that must be properly managed. This was not done in this case. 'Goodluck died because the standard of care taken by Grace Adeleye in carrying out the circumcision fell far below the standard that should be applied. She also failed to inform his parents of the risks and possible complications, which ultimately led to his tragic death.' Sentencing was adjourned for the preparation of pre-sentence reports. Adeleye, of Sarnia Court, Salford, Greater Manchester, was granted bail with conditions. THe court heard how she botched the procedure by leaving a 'ragged' wound that bled. Her post-op care was also described as woefully inadequate. Adrian Darbishire QC, opening the case for the prosecution, told the jury: 'The allegation essentially here is that the care she provided in the course of that procedure was so bad that not only did it cause the death of that young baby wholly unnecessarily, but it amounted to gross negligence and a crime.' The Royal Oldham Hospital was just a mile and a half from the family home in Chadderton, near Oldham, but by the time an ambulance was called the child could not be saved . Mr Darbishire said circumcisions were . routinely carried out among Christian families in Nigeria who brought . the tradition with them to the UK, and the procedure was an 'ancient, . well established and widespread' practice across the world. But the court heard that up to three . children a month are admitted to the Royal Manchester Children’s . Hospital due to bleeding after home-based circumcisions - a danger the nurse should have been aware of. Goodluck was born on March 22, 2010, in Rochdale and died on April 17, the day after the circumcision, aged 27 days. Adeleye was introduced to the family through a friend as she had performed many circumcisions over the years and offered her 'experience and skill'. Around 5pm on April 16, Goodluck’s father, Olajunti Fatunla, brought Adeleye by car to the family home — and the nurse sent him immediately to get some Calpol while she and the mother, Sylvia Attiko, prepared for the operation. Once inside, Adeleye told the boy’s mother to fetch some olive oil and a bowl of warm water and the child was stripped to just his vest. Adeleye then brought her 'instruments' out of her handbag and dipped a pair of scissors into the water in a kidney dish. Nurse: Adeleye was introduced to Goodluck's family through a friend as she had performed many circumcisions before . 'At that point Sylvia closed her eyes,' Mr Darbishire said. 'Goodluck had had no anaesthetic or local pain relief at this point and that is not how this should be done. 'By the time Sylvia opened her eyes the operation was over. She could see the foreskin between the blades of the scissors.' Adeleye then cleaned the wound with cotton wool and applied a bandage. The boy was 'crying throughout' and the wound was bleeding, but Adeleye told the mother this was normal, the court heard. The defendant left the house between 30 and 40 minutes after surgery and the £100 had been handed over, without any proper checks on the patient after the procedure, it was alleged. The parents later found the bandage had come off the wound, which was dripping with blood. Mr Darbishire said even a small amount of blood loss is dangerous and the loss of just one sixth of a pint of blood can be fatal for a newborn. The concerned parents, who had no medical training, called the defendant around two and a half hours later. Adeleye told them the bleeding was normal and 'not a problem' and advised a change of nappy and bandage and to apply olive oil. In fact Adeleye should have advised immediate medical attention. 'To delay and reassure was simply not appropriate,' the prosecutor told the jury. 'His parents remained concerned but they had been reassured by the defendant.' However, the following morning it was clear something was wrong and at 7.20am an ambulance was called. Mr Darbishire added: 'I have no doubt there will be much criticism of the parents by their inaction. 'But can I invite you to consider this. One of the hardest things as a parent, especially parents of a young child, is knowing when to be worried and how worried to be. 'But on the other hand no one wants to make a fuss about nothing.' A post-mortem examination found Goodluck died from blood loss after the op. Mr Darbishire said: 'His death was wholly unnecessary. He bled to death over a period of many hours when medical assistance, which could have saved his life, was minutes away.'","Goodluck Caubergs died at family home in Chadderton following operation .

Science minister David Willetts urged his counterparts to impose restrictions, claiming the spread of antibiotic resistance could be as damaging as climate change . Britain yesterday urged rich nations to clamp down on antibiotics amid fears their overuse will lead to the catastrophic spread of drug-resistant superbugs. Science minister David Willetts urged his counterparts to impose restrictions, claiming the spread of antibiotic resistance could be as damaging to humanity as climate change. He is proposing far-reaching measures that would clamp down on the overuse of antibiotics by GPs and hospital doctors. He also wants to restrict usage on farms and fisheries, where the drugs are blended with feed to boost yields. The minister also called for increased research to find new drugs to fight bacteria, and ways to strengthen cross-border surveillance for emerging resistant strains. He told a national newspaper: ‘Across the G8, we should regard the spread of antibiotic resistance as a global challenge that is up there with climate change, water stress and environmental damage, and there are genuine policy consequences that follow from that.’ Science ministers from across the G8 - the world’s richest and most industrialised nations - met at the Royal Society in London yesterday. It comes just months after England’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, warned that untreatable infections posed a ‘catastrophic threat’ to the population. She has asked for antibiotic resistance to be added to the government’s national risk register, a move that makes the issue easier to raise abroad. ‘The soaring number of antibiotic-resistant infections poses such a great threat to society that in 20 years’ time we could be taken back to a 19th century environment where everyday infections kill us as a result of routine operations,’ she said. Drug-resistance is an inevitable consequence of antibiotics. The drugs wipe out the vast majority of bacteria causing infections, but a small number will always survive. He is proposing far-reaching measures that would clamp down on the overuse of antibiotics by GPs and hospital doctors . These survivors are the most . resistant, and will multiply into a new generation of more resistant . organisms. In time, they can become immune to even the strongest . antibiotics. Resistant strains of life-threatening MRSA and C difficile ‘superbugs’ are already on the rise. Doctors are also seeing ever more resistant strains of TB, E. coli and Klebsiella, which causes pneumonia. Some 80 per cent of gonorrhoea is now resistant to the frontline antibiotic tetracycline. Of serious concern is the rise of resistance to powerful drugs called carbapenems, the antibiotics of last resort. The first few cases were detected in Britain in 2003, but since then the numbers have soared to 217 cases in the first six months of 2011.","Science minister David Willetts urged counterparts to impose restrictions, claiming .

A real-life Iron Man suit has been developed that lets astronauts jump to Earth without a parachute - instead using rocket boots to soften the landing. The design of the RL Mark VI is reminiscent of the suit used by Tony Stark in the Iron Man films and also comes with hi-tech augmented reality goggles, power gloves, movement gyros and is made using a commercial space suit. It has been built as part of a joint project between Baltimore-based space firm Solar System Express and biomedical design company, Juxtopia who want to release a production model by 2016. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of how a 'space diver' could look. Teams from Solar System Express and Juxtopia in Baltimore have developed a suit that could be used for space diving. It has been designed to be fitted with 'rocket boots' meaning the diver could jump from his spaceship in low Earth orbit and land without the need of a parachute. The designs are based on how Tony Stark lands and flies in the Iron Man films and a production model could be available as soon as 2016 . The real-life Iron Man suit. This yellow prototype has been developed by Baltimore-based Space Solar Express Chief Technology Officer Blaze Sanders, pictured. Its made from a commercial space suit. It will be fitted with 'rocket boots' and tested at altitude by July 2016 . The RL MARK VI would let people make high-altitude jumps from near-space, suborbital space, and eventually low Earth orbit itself. Felix Baumgartner successfully completed a space dive from 127,852 feet above the Earth, in October last year. His free fall took 4 minutes and 19 seconds before he opened his parachute. The teams from Solar System Express and Juxtopia plan to carry out flight tests of the MARK VI in a similar way to how Baumgartner's completed his dive, to see how the suit survives the fall. They then plan to use modern 'wing suit' skydiving technology with small aerospike engines attached to the suit boots that will let the diver glide, move and land using just propulsion engines on his feet. The AR goggles made by Juxtopia work in a similar way to Google Glass. They are designed to give the diver information about altitude, elevation, acceleration rates, location - using GPS and Federal Aviation Administration radar information - and trajectory data during the jump. Designs showing what the 'rocket boots on the RL MARK VI could look like'. They will be fitted with small aerospike propulsion engines that will let the diver glide, move and land on his feet without the need for a parachute . In a video produced by Solar System Express and Juxtopia, the teams demonstrate how their space diving suit would look. The space diving video shows an astronaut jumping from a spaceship and flying to Earth before landing using rocket boots . It can also tell the diver if there are any malfunctions that could stop the boots from helping him land, in which case he could switch to using the parachute. They can also respond to voice commands by filtering out other noise such as wind, air and engine sounds. The goggles will not have the video mode seen in Google Glass though, and instead will use 'Optical See-Through' technology that is similar to the Heads Up Display seen on modern fighter jets. This view places the information over the pilot's view, instead of obstructing it. As the diver reaches Earth, the mini aerospike thrusters in the rocket boots will kick in. The 'Iron Man' suit will be fitted with hi-tech augmented reality goggles designed by Juxtopia. They can give the diver information about altitude, elevation, acceleration rates, location - using GPS and FAA radar information - and trajectory data during the jump. It can also show temperatures, heart rates, and warn the diver if there are any malfunctions that could stop him landing safely . Solar System Express is hoping there will be two different landing methods and plan to test both. The first will be 'a feet-down' method with the aerospikes kicking in from an altitude of about hundred feet. The second, and more similar to how Tony Stark lands in Iron Man, will see the diver use 'wing suit flare up' to slow him down. The suit could be similar to the Iron Man suit worn in the hit series of films - and will even have a similar head-up display . The Iron Man suit as seen in the film series - which also has rocket boosters and allows Tony Stark to fly . The diver will then swoop within ten feet of the ground before pulling upright and lighting the thrusters. The first live tests will be used during traditional parachute jumps. Solar System Express plans to then fully test these landing methods at altitude by July 2016. It is then hoping to launching a production model of the RL Mark VI later that year. The aerospike engine is a type of rocket engine that can be used at different altitudes. It produces thrust that can be used to propel a person or vehicle forward or upwards. They are similar to the larger engines used to launch space shuttles and because they use traditionally 25 to 35% less fuel than other types of rocket engines, were initially tested for the Space Shuttle Main Engine. The term aerospike is used for a truncated plug nozzle with a conical taper and some gas injection that formed an 'air spike'. The basic concept of any engine bell is to move the flow of exhaust gases from the rocket engine in one direction, causing thrust and propulsion. Instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell, an aerospike engine fires along the outside edge the 'spike'.

A California judge ordered a second medical evaluation today for 13-year-old Jahi McMath, who was declared brain-dead and on life support, before the hospital switches off the machine. Jahi's family are fighting to keep their daughter on life support, just days before Christmas. The teenager experienced complications following a tonsillectomy at Children's Hospital in Oakland. Jahi McMath (pictured) has been on life support at Children's Hospital Oakland in Northern California since December 12, three days after undergoing standard tonsil surgery. her family have fought to prove there is a chance she will wake up while doctors have said it isn't possible . As her family sat stone-faced in the front row of the courtroom today, an Alameda County judge called for Jahi to be independently examined by Paul Graham Fisher, the chief of child neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine. The examination was expected to occur later today. Hospital staff and Fisher will conduct an electroencephalogram, or EEG, and tests to see if blood is still flowing to Jahi's brain. Doctors at Children's Hospital concluded the girl was brain dead on Dec. 12 and wanted to remove her from life support. Jahi's family wants to keep her hooked up to a respirator, and eventually have her moved to another facility. The family said they believe she is still alive, and that the hospital should not remove her from the ventilator without their permission. 'It's wrong for someone who made mistakes on your child to just call the coroner ... and not respect the family's feeling or rights' Sandra Chatman, Jahi's grandmother, said in the hallway outside the courtroom. 'I know Jahi suffered and it tears me up.' Heartbroken: Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield (pictured in court on December 20) is seen crying as the judge ordered a second opinion on the case . The family's attorney also asked Judge Evelio Grillo to allow a third evaluation by Paul Byrne, a pediatric professor at the University of Toledo. The hospital's attorney objected to Byrne, saying he is not a pediatric neurologist. The judge is expected to take up the request to use Byrne, and another hearing was scheduled for Tuesday morning, Christmas Eve. Jahi's family says the girl bled profusely after a routine tonsillectomy and then went into cardiac arrest before being declared brain dead. Outside the courtroom, Dr. David Durand, chief of pediatrics at Children's, said, that staff have the 'deepest sympathy' for the family, but that Jahi is brain dead. 'The ventilator cannot reverse the brain death that has occurred and it would be wrong to give false hope that Jahi will ever come back to life,' he said. Christopher Dolan, the family's attorney, vowed to keep Jahi hooked to the ventilator through Christmas, vowing to file an appeal if the judge orders her removed from the machine on Tuesday. 'I am confident she'll live through Christmas,' a visibly weary Dolan said after the hearing. Given the very public battle over Jahi's treatment, the judge pleaded with attorneys on both sides to continue speaking with each other and the family to help prepare for his eventual final order. 'This is a very, very charged case. The stakes are very high because there's a young girl involved,' Grillo said.","Jahi McMath experienced complications following a tonsillectomy .

Armed marine commandos boarded their decommissioned fast attack gun ship Defender, which has two fearsome-looking cannons, and took them into custody in Dakar. The Senegalese authorities said the four - all ex-UK servicemen - were detained on suspicion of 'illegal activity'. Farcical: The gunboat Defender, pictured impounded in Tenerife, was being crewed by four British ex-servicemen on an 'anti-piracy' mission,  It has now been seized by Senegalese authorities . The group, led by former Royal Navy . submariner Chris Enmarch, had already had the 127ft Defender . impounded in the Canary Islands.

But after five weeks on the island the crew gave the authorities the slip - only to be impounded a second time five days later. The group are reported to be heading to the pirate-infested Gulf of Guinea where they planned to offer security to oil rigs. They insist they are 'not mercenaries' and their boat has no working weapons or ammunition. They left Cornwall on April 16 and before departing Mr Enmarch, from Penryn, said they were going on an anti-piracy mission. He said they were heading to Senegal .

They were forced to stop in the . resort of Los Cristianos where they were boarded by Spanish Civil Guard . officers who refused them permission to stay there. The vessel was then escorted 50 miles to a berth in the island's Santa Cruz port by a Spanish navy warship. Officials are understood to have been . suspicious that the formidable looking vessel, which flies the British . flag, was registered as a pleasure boat. The Spanish ministry of defence said . an inspection revealed 'irregularities in the paperwork of the boat and . its crew, as well as deficiencies in safety equipment'. Mr Enmarch, 53, who bought the boat . in 2011, was fined 40,000 euros because its waste systems did not meet . standards set for pleasure vessels. The ship's British pendant was removed and it was placed under the custody of armed Civil Guards. One report in Spain said the Defender was actually en route for Nigeria. Mr Enmarch accused the Spanish . authorities of making a 'fuss about nothing' and said the cannons on his . boat were 'just for show and totally unusable'. But in the early hours of May 31, . while the guards were called away, the Defender set off with the fine . allegedly outstanding and five days later it was intercepted off . Senegal.

A former University of Alabama basketball standout has been charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping for his alleged role in a bizarre plot to kidnap his own 6-year-old cousin earlier this year. Also involved in the plot is 18-year-old Devonta Pollard's mother, 21-year-old cousin, aunt and uncle. According to authorities, the family plotted to kidnap Jashayla Hopson, Pollard's cousin, in an effort to get the girl's mother - Pollard's aunt - Roshell Ford, to make a deal in a property dispute she had with Brown-Pollard. Foul: former University of Alabama basketball star Devonta Pollard is facing up to five years in prison for his alleged role in a bizarre plot to kidnap his own cousin . Kemper County Sheriff James Moore told ABC News that the dispute is over a one-acre piece of land in Porterville, Mississippi, that once was owned by Brown-Pollard. When the house on the property burned down, Brown-Pollard lost the land and it was sold to Ford. After the sale, Brown-Pollard allegedly conspired with a friend, 52-year-old Wanda Darcy, to kidnap the little girl in an attempt to coerce the girl's mother into giving her back the land. ""They began talking and Pollard told . Dancy that she wanted to take Roshell Ford's daughter for 'leverage' to . get her land back,"" FBI Special Agent Charles G. Murrow stated in his . affidavit. On April 30, Hopson was in her school library when Jessie Pollard picked her up and drove her to a motel. She allegedly then sent the girl's mother a text message that read, 'don't call the police I will call you . later if you call the police u won't see her again.' The number used to call Hopson's mother was traced to a Samsung phone bought at a Walmart in Bessemer, Alabama, on April 30. Surveillance footage from the Walmart shows Pollard purchasing the phone. Pollard's mother, Jessie Mae Pollard Brown is the alleged mastermind behind the poorly thought out plan to kidnap her own neice . After the initial text message, Shaquayla Johnigan drove the girl to a motel in Laurel, Mississippi, where she sent Hopson's mother further instructions. 'since you called police, I want $50,000 by 3 p.m., I will tell you location later,' the text message read, according to the indictment. That's when authorities began to suspect that Brown-Pollard was involved in the kidnapping - she was questioned by police and asked to take a polygraph. Pollard allegedly then told his cousin Shaquayla Johnigan and her mother, 42-year-old Joyce Johnigan, that his mother was being questioned by police. So the pair drove the girl to a rural location in eastern Mississippi and dropped her off outside of a stranger's home. Pollard scored 141 points during his first season with the Crimson Tide . Shaquayla Johnigan then drove the car she was driving into a ditch and threw the keys into a pond. Her father, 39-year-old James Johnigan, then burned the phone the plotters used to contact Hopson's mother. About 1:25 p.m. on May 1, police found the girl at the stranger's home and returned her to her mother. For their roles, the Johnigans and Pollard face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. Pollard-Brown could face up to life in prison and a $750,000 fine. Pollard has since been forced off of the University of Alabama's basketball team.","Also involved in the plot is Devonta Pollard's mother, cousin, aunt and uncle .

A man accused of blackmailing hundreds of women into stripping for him as he watched over the internet could face a 105 year prison sentence. So-called 'sextortionist' Karen 'Gary' Kazaryan, 27, is said to have coerced more than 350 young women into showing him their naked bodies by hacking into their Facebook and e-mail accounts, posing as a friend, and coaxing them to strip as he watched via Skype - often capturing images of them shedding their clothes. Kazaryan, of Glendale, California, is also alleged to have searched the accounts he hacked for existing naked or revealing pictures of his victims, which - if a woman discovered his ruse - he would use to blackmail her into yet more stripping. Around 3,000 pictures of naked and semi-naked women were discovered on Kazaryan's computer, according to federal investigators, who said the 27-year-old would repeatedly contact his victims and demand they expose themselves to him over Skype. In some cases he is accused of posting naked pictures to the victims' Facebook pages when they refused his demands. He was arrested yesterday and is facing 15 charges of computer intrusion and 15 of aggravated identity theft, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison told the Associated Press. Not all of the women allegedly targeted in Kazaryan's complex scam have been identified, but FBI investigators estimate he had over 350 victims. It is thought most were aged 20 or younger, and local to Kazaryan's home city of Glendale. Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office, said most of the victims were local to the Glendale area. If convicted, Kazaryan faces up to 105 years in jail. He is due to appear in court in the U.S. on March 12. Sextortion is a term used to describe the exploitation of a victim who is blackmailed using a nude image of themselves shared over the internet.

They could be scenes from the Third World as families eke out a living in makeshift shelters amid the filth of a rubbish dump. But the extraordinary photographs were taken at the site of a former football ground in a leafy London suburb. More than 50 Romanians are living in ramshackle huts made from waste wood, rubble and plastic – just yards from playing fields and £400,000 family homes. Shanty town: More than 50 Romanians are living in a rundown former football stadium in north London . Ramshackle: Makeshift buildings have been erected at the former Hendon Football Club . Neighbours: Family homes in the streets surrounding the camp are worth around £400,000 . For more than two years, migrants from the Transylvania region of Romania have been travelling to the site in Hendon as they find work in the capital. They have forced gaps in a 10ft fence around the site – ignoring warning signs in Romanian – to make their home in the camp despite it having no running water, electricity or sanitation and being next to ever-growing piles of vermin-infested filth. They scavenge in the rubbish for clothes to wear or for things to sell to buy food. Britain is expecting an influx of Romanians – and Bulgarians – when they are given free access to our jobs market in January. Ministers have refused to put an estimate on how many will travel here but campaign group MigrationWatch says it could be 50,000 every year for five years from 2014. Tiberius Bokor, 26, lives in a 6ft by 12ft ‘home’ with his wife and four others. He comes from Brasov in Transylvania and earns about £40 a day as a labourer while his wife, Brittany, 26, who is the only woman in the camp, earns about £30 a day at a car wash. Cramped: Tiberius Bokor, 26, is one of six people living in a 12ft by 6ft hut on the site . Destination: Romanians are told about the site before arriving in the UK where they earn around £40 a day . ‘We knew about this place before we travelled to Britain,’ he said. ‘We came a week ago. When I got here I built this shelter in a day. I am here because I can earn more than I can at home. 'I came here for eight months last year and I think we will be here now for three months. We are always coming back and forth. ‘Everyone has children at home that they are trying to provide for.’ Mrs Bokor sends most of her wages home to the couple’s two young sons, who are living with family in Romania. She said: ‘We have no fresh water. We can use the water in the park to bathe and wash clothes but we go to Tesco to get drinking water. ‘Obviously no one wants to live like this. We have told the council that we are happy to clear the rubbish away but they just want rid of us. The rats are a problem but there is a local cat that helps.’ She said the council should do more ‘to make this place safe’ and accused the police of ‘hassling’ them. Problems: Despite Barnet Council erecting a 10ft security fence around the site it has been repeatedly re-occupied . Their shelter is split into three areas each with two mattresses. Upturned buckets are used as seats and clothes are kept in bags hung on nails in the wooden walls. Mrs Bokor, who keeps in touch with her children through Skype, said the council had asked if any of them wanted to go home. ‘We all want to see our families but we are here to work,’ she said. ‘I would love to live in the UK permanently. I would love to have enough money to bring all my family here.’ Gus Bodur, 49, was involved with Hendon FC, who formerly played at the site, and still lives nearby. He says it’s ‘heartbreaking’ what has happened to the ground. ‘The club used to be an important part of the community,’ he said. ‘These people have been seen arriving at the ground with a map telling them where to go. The site should be cleared and then pulled down. It is a great shame.’ Dump: The area is littered with rubbish which the Romanians pick through to find things to sell . David Haynes, 75, who has lived opposite the site for 40 years, said: ‘There started to be a problem with fly-tipping but then the migrants moved in too. Even after the fence was put up there was a problem. The council and the police are not doing enough.’ Barnet Council sold the site to developers last year but still owns the freehold. Legal challenges over its sale have held up development. A council spokesman said: ‘We have been working with the police, the leaseholder and homeless charities to clear the area and repatriate the squatters. Despite repeated attempts to secure the site, it has been illegally re-occupied on at least three occasions.’ Asked if it had considered paying for security at the site, the spokesman said: ‘That would be a matter for the developer.’","More than 50 Romanians living among rubbish in north London wasteground .

An embarrassing situation for McDonald's has now escalated as the fast food giant temporarily shut down their now-infamous staff-only website, McResource Line, on Wednesday after it was revealed the chain had been lecturing employees not to eat take out. The same site hit headlines earlier this year for urging employees to sell their things and get second jobs to make ends meet. A graphic on the homepage read: 'Fast foods are quick, reasonably priced, and readily available alternatives to home cooking. While convenient and economical for a busy lifestyle, fast foods are typically high in calories, fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt and may put people at risk for becoming overweight.' Good idea, bad idea: McDonald's didn't think its employees should eat the food they serve, as seen in this graph from their staff website McResource Line, which was pulled down this week . 'We are temporarily performing some maintenance in order to provide you with the best experience possible. Please excuse us while these upgrades are being made,' it said. McDonald's confirmed the site had been taken down, CNN reported. 'A combination of factors has led us to re-evaluate and we've directed the vendor to take down the website,' they said in a statement. 'Between links to irrelevant or outdated information, along with outside groups taking elements out of context, this created unwarranted scrutiny and inappropriate commentary. 'None of this helps our McDonald's team members.' The anti-fast food advice was given with graphics depicting the ‘unhealthy choice’ and the ‘healthier choice.’ Despite featuring a vast array of deep fried delicacies, the Golden Arches reminded employees that ‘avoiding items that are deep fried are your best bet.’ Solid advice: Don't eat at McDonald's. The fast food chain were forced to admit the embarrassing and 'outdated' information on their site has lead to a temporarily shutdown for 'upgrades' The sensible advice also told McWorkers to ‘limit the extras such as cheese, bacon and mayonnaise.’ Such tasty add-ons are staples of many menu items they serve on a daily basis. A . hamburger, fries and soda were warned against, because ‘eating a diet . high in fat puts people at rick for becoming overweight.’ Many . locations offer steep food discounts and short breaks to employees, . virtually forcing them to eat the unhealthy food, often forcing the hand . of workers without the time or means to eat elsewhere. ‘It is hard to eat a healthy diet when you eat at fast-food restaurants often,’ the advice continued. ‘Many foods are cooked with a lot of fat, even if they are not trans fats. Many fast-food restaurants do not offer any lower-fat foods.’ The world’s largest fast food chain wants employees to eat elsewhere. ‘Eat at places that offer a variety of salads, soups, and vegetables,’ the site says. This advice comes after a series of tips telling employees find second jobs, apply for food stamps and sell their things to weather a financial crisis. The site also gave advice on how to tip au pairs, doormen, personal trainers and pool boys. Before shutting down the site, a McDonald's spokesperson said the messages had been ‘taken entirely out of context.'","The same website that told employees to apply for food stamps, pawn their things and find second jobs as at it again this week, telling staff not to eat deep-fried food and choose 'healthier options .

Unrepentant: Joanne Caplis was ordered to carry out 80 hours unpaid work after a trial, but appeared to mock the sentence on Facebook . A shameless thief who stole from a charity publicly mocked the soft sentence she was given on Facebook. Shopworker Joanne Caplis, 43, was ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work for taking £50 from Shopmobility which provides scooters for disabled clients. But within hours of leaving court she posted on her profile: '80 hours community service ha bloody ha.' Caplis - who still protests her innocence - then used offensive language to describe her former employer. She defiantly refused to apologise today and claimed she was poking fun at the system rather than scoffing at the leniency of her sentence. She said: 'I am not sorry because I have not done anything wrong. I posted on Facebook ""ha bloody ha"" because I think it is ridiculous.' Caplis, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, worked at the charity’s branch in Wigan where bosses spotted irregularities with the accounts. She pleaded not guilty to fraud by altering banking spreadsheets but was found guilty of the two charges at Wigan Magistrates Court. She was given a community order and told to pay £50 compensation with a £60 victim surcharge. David Eccles, general manager of Shopmobility, said: 'I have known Joanne for more than 15 years. 'She was a volunteer and then became a part-time paid employee. 'We noticed the inaccuracies by chance and found proof she stole £50. We all knew it could only be one person who could have done it. Today Caplis insisted she was innocent and was making fun of the system that found her guilty rather than scoffing at the leniency of her sentence . 'There was only one paid employee who did the banking on those particular days. We sacked her on the spot and her reaction was disbelief. 'We feel really disappointed and hurt that someone we trusted had done this. Our clients - people from Wigan and Leigh - trusted her. They were all friends and she has let us all down. 'We don’t have a lot of cash and we are struggling. In a week we probably take between £200 and £300, so taking money makes it even harder.' Caplis claimed: 'I never hid anything from anyone. I went to see a solicitor about the way bosses sacked me, as they did not follow protocol. 'The only reason there is no tribunal is because I couldn’t afford it. 'I feel so angry about it.

Syrian President Bashar Assad could be given safe passage out of the country, David Cameron said today . BRITAIN is to open talks with gunmen seeking to overthrow Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad after David Cameron signalled that he would like to start arming the rebels. In a dramatic escalation of the UK’s involvement in the Syrian civil war, the Prime Minister will today give the green light for British officials to advise rebel commanders on the ground for the first time. Officials say the talks are designed to help the opposition forces form one united rebel army to bring about regime change. But in a clear sign that he would like to go even further, Mr Cameron told the Mail that he is ‘frustrated’ by the EU arms embargo on sending weapons to Syria, of which Britain is part. ‘We must ask ourselves, “What more can we do to help the opposition?”,’ he declared, adding that he is ‘not currently planning to’ supply arms to the rebels. ‘I am very frustrated we can’t do more,’ he said during a trip to the Middle East. ‘This is an appalling slaughter. We must keep pushing, keep seeing what more can be done to hasten the political transition that’s clearly needed.’ Raising the stakes further, Mr Cameron said yesterday that President al Assad would be offered a safe haven if he wants to flee the country – but not in Britain. The Prime Minister visited the Jordanian capital Amman ahead of a trip today to a refugee camp on Jordan’s border with Syria, where thousands have fled the bloodshed, which has already cost 40,000 lives. He will announce a £14.5million boost in humanitarian aid from Britain to UN agencies helping those in the camps. The UK has already donated £39.5million. The talks with rebel commanders, which put the UK one step closer to military intervention, will be announced to Parliament today by Foreign Secretary William Hague. Until now British contacts have been limited to discussions with the civilian wings of rebel forces such as the Free Syrian Army and political leaders in exile. The new engagement with rebel commanders will be led by John Wilks, a Foreign Office Arabic speaker who has been acting as Mr Cameron’s envoy to the opposition. Scroll down for video .

'The thousands of . Syrians who have lost relatives are entitled to and deserve credible . justice, and President Assad and his commanders must be held to account . for their brutal actions.

Police officers could be brought in to help alleviate a chronic nurse shortage amid proposals being presented to a Scottish health board. NHS Grampian warned in April of a massive lack of staff at Aberdeen’s Royal Cornhill Hospital. Now, it has emerged a local forum has discussed the possibility of drafting in assistance from Police Scotland and the Red Cross. Two months ago it was announced that 30 nursing posts had to be filled as soon as possible at the hospital. Aberdeen's Royal Cornhill Hospital has such a severe shortage of nurses that it is considering bringing in police officers or Red Cross volunteers to alleviate the problem . However, nine positions are still available and staff are still being forced to handle issues they are not trained to deal with. At a meeting of the Grampian Area Partnership Forum in March, contingency planning within the health board’s mental heal service was discussed. And a reference was made at looking at ‘third sector’ for assistance with ‘back-up’. The minutes from the meeting will go before NHS Grampian tomorrow. But critics have hit out at the idea, claiming that using police staff or Red Cross volunteers was ‘scandalous’. Scottish Patients Association chairwoman, Margaret Watt said: ‘I’ve never heard of such a cock-eyed idea in my entire life. ‘The purpose of the police is not to help out in hospitals - they do not have the training to look after the patients in our hospitals. ‘You also have to ask how qualified the Red Cross are. They might be better trained than police, but not nurses.’ North East Labour MSP Richard Baker says that the situation raises questions about Health Secretary Alex Neil (pictured) While Red Cross volunteers and police staff have not been contacted, North East Labour MSP Richard Baker said the move would be a ‘national scandal’. He said: ‘It seems to be a very extreme situation to have to resort to police staff for care and treatment at the facility. ‘I’ve never heard of a situation like this one right across the whole of Scotland. ‘Having to resort to bringing in police and the Red Cross to keep the hospital going would be a national scandal. ‘It raises questions about how resources are being managed at NHS Grampian - but it also raises questions about Health Secretary Alex Neil.’ A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ‘Under the SNP, NHS Grampian’s budget is at record levels and has received a 4.2 per cent increase in funding in this financial year. ‘That increase comes in contrast to Labour’s own admission that they wouldn’t ring-fence the health budget, and despite Westminster slashing Scotland’s overall budget. ‘We expect health boards to have the right staff in place to deliver a first-class service to patients and welcome the new appointments made at Royal Cornhill and that further recruitment is planned. ‘The new workforce planning tool, which became compulsory on April 1, will ensure that hospitals have the right number of people and the right skills mix in place in order to deal with the demands placed upon them.’ NHS Grampian admitted that staffing issues are ‘challenging’, however they added that the situation is improving. An NHS spokeswoman said: ‘The staffing position, whilst challenging, continues to improve. ‘Following a national advertising campaign another 11 registered nurses have been appointed. ‘Another round of interviews will take place in July.’ A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ‘Unless NHS Grampian actually get in touch with us we have no comment to make.’","Aberdeen's Royal Cornhill Hospital has a chronic shortage of nursing staff .

Mr Whittaker, who is a corrections officer, was questioned because Greene told investigators that he had given some weapons to 'a friend in law enforcement'. The main focus of the investigation, however, has been the apartment that Greene and Gliedman lived while she was pregnant with their child. Gliedman, 27, went into labor during her arrest and because she stopped doing heroin during her pregnancy, the child was born drug free. Inside the apartment, officers found . seven grams of the explosive powder HMTD, which was reportedly the . substance used in the 2005 London Underground bombings. Target: Greene was allegedly seen sprinkling powder around the arch in Washington Square and watching it explode . Dangerous: The NYPD bomb squad was called in to remove the explosive that was discovered in the couple Greenwich Village apartment . The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive. Police . also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a $1,000 Ruger over-under hunting . shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a . replica of an M203 grenade launcher. Several disturbing items were seized, . including: 'The Terroristâ€™s Encyclopedia V. 1.02,' 'Improvised and . Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons,' 'A Do-It-Yourself . Submachine Gun,' and U.S. Army manuals for creating and planting booby . traps and explosives. Officers . were tipped off about the explosives by someone who met Gliedman and . Greene, 31, in Washington Square Park. The couple invited the informant to . their apartment to take a shower, which is when he spotted the weapons, The Post reported. 'Junkies': Morgan Gliedman, 27, and Aaron . Greene, 31, are both admitted heroin addicts - even though Gliedman was . heavily pregnant when the explosives were found at their apartment, . police say . The . apartment on Manhattan's West Ninth Street is near the apartment where . two rich young men accidentally blew themselves up while making a bomb . for the extremist group the Weather Underground in 1970. Greene . and Gliedman had no such plans, police sources are saying. They are . just wealthy drug addicts with a twisted idea of what's 'cool,' according to the Daily Beast. Friends revealed to the New York Post . that Gliedman, a former student of New York prep school Dalton, was on a . safe track to success until she met Greene, who has a series of felony . weapons charges to his name.

Rehab-bound: Gliedman was whisked away to a mandatory 30-day treatment program . She went to New York University and then attended the Art Institute of Chicago for a masters in Creative Writing. 'She . comes from a great family, raised on Park Avenue, went to a great . school, but then this guy introduced her to drugs,' a friend told the . Post. They added that Gliedman stopped doing heroin when she learned she was pregnant, and the baby was born drug-free. The newborn, named Melody Sunshine, is now being cared for by . Gliedman's mother, Susyn Schops Gliedman, a broker, and father, Dr. Paul Gliedman, head of radiation oncology at Beth Israel Brooklyn. When Gleidman is released from the treatment program, she will allowed to travel throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn, said celebrity bail bondsman Ira Judelson, who posted Gliedman's bail. 'She wants to get clean. She wants to address this legal issue. She wants to raise her daughter,' he added. Gliedman will be back in court on January 29 on the weapons charges and unrelated theft charges.

A man has been left blind after an angry mob of villagers caught him stealing a cow and injected acid into his eyeball as punishment. The known animal thief is now completely without sight after a his other eye was injured in an identical incident five years ago. The incident took place at a remote village in the north-east Indian state of Bihar last week. Rural: The north-eastern state of Bihar, above, in India has seen these types of vigilante attacks among its rural villagers before. Police are now members of the community for inflicting inhumane treatment . According to local reports, Mohammad Shahid, 46 from Balchanda-Haripur village in the largely Muslim Araria district, broke into the cowshed of another villager Gosai Mandal. He untied the animal and was fleeing the scene when the house owner woke up and raised an alarm. After being woke by the disturbance, local villagers chased Shahid and found him with the cow nearby. It is alleged the crowd beat him while a syringe full of acid was fetched and injected it into his right eyeball. After the attack, he was handed over to the local police who admitted him to a local government hospital for treatment. Local police inspector Vivekanand Singh said his officers are now investigating the villagers who are accused of 'inflicting inhumane treatment'. Speaking of the victim, Singh added: 'For similar charges, he was sent to jail in the past but he did not quit his old habit even after coming out of jail' Symbolic: Cows are regarded sacred by Hindus, who make up about 80 percent of India's 960 million people, because they represent motherhood . The incident is a reminder of the 1980 attacks in Bhagalpur when the police had blinded as many as 31 prisoners who were convicted or in the process of being tried by pouring acid into their eyes.

Six of the world's seven billion people have mobile phones - but only 4.5 billion have a toilet, according to a U.N. report. The shocking statistic has prompted the international organisation to launch a global campaign to improve sanitation for the 2.5 billion people whose health is at risk. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson called their plight 'a silent disaster' that reflects the extreme poverty and huge inequalities in the world today. Risk: Open defecation in developing countries such as India reflects the huge inequalities in the world, the U.N. says . Eliasson told a press conference that the issue must be addressed immediately for the world to meet the U.N. goal of halving the proportion of people without access to sanitation by the end of 2015. World leaders set a series of Millennium Development Goals to combat poverty at a summit in 2000, and Eliasson said the sanitation goal lags farthest behind. Warning: The U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson said the lack of sanitation for so many is a 'silent disaster' While most people don't want to talk . about the problem, Eliasson said, 'it goes to the heart of ensuring good . health, a clean environment and fundamental dignity for billions of . people.' The U.N. said action must include eliminating by 2025 the practice of open defecation, which perpetuates disease. The number of people resorting to . open defecation has decreased by 271 million since 1990, but it is still . practiced by 1.1 billion people, or 15 percent of the world's . population, the U.N. said. It is one of the main causes of . diarrhea, which results in the death of more than 750,000 children under . the age of five every year, the U.N. said. Eliasson said 22 countries account for more than 80 percent of open defecation in the world. According to a U.N. official, . the countries are Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Cambodia, Ethiopia, . Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra . Leone, Zambia, Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Chad, Congo, Niger, Sudan and . South Sudan. India alone accounts for 60 per cent of the number of people who practice open defecation. This stands in stark contrast to the rise of the mobile phone market in the fast-developing economy. There are now close to 1billion phones in India - a meteoric rise from just 45million in 2002. Problem: The U.N. says emergeing economies such as Brazil, pictured, account for 80 per cent of open defecation . Around 14million people in China, pictured, do not have access to a toilet but there are an estimated 986million mobile phones registered . Despite the lack of sanitation, most people are able to afford a mobile phone with a wide range available for £10 or less and the price of calls reducing from 10p a minute to 2p a minute in the last decade. Mobile phone retail and repair shops are now commonplace in cities throughout India and Nokia now has its biggest factory in the world in Chennai. Martin . Mogwanja, deputy executive director of the U.N. children's agency . UNICEF, said at the present rate of progress, the U.N. sanitation goal . will be reached in 2075 instead of 2015, which is unacceptable.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:13 EST, 25 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:13 EST, 25 December 2013 . Leader: A picture believed to be Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who heads al-Qaida's Nusra Front . Scrawled notes from the shadowy leader of a powerful al-Qaida group fighting in Syria revealed a plot to kidnap UN workers, according to excerpts of the letters. The plans, believed to have been written by Abu Mohammed al-Golani, were handed over by Iraqi intelligence officers along with the first known photo of the Nusra Front leader. Included in the notes from al-Golani, who heads one of the most powerful bands of radicals fighting the Syrian government, were instructions for aides to continue with the plans in the event of his death. The officials said they obtained the information about al-Golani after capturing members of another al-Qaida group in September. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to journalists. 'I was told by a soldier that he observed some of the workers of the UN and he will kidnap them. I ask God for his success,' read an excerpt of a letter given by officials from Iraq's Falcon Intelligence Cell, an anti-terrorism unit that works under Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. The officials said other letters planned the kidnapping and killing of other foreigners, and Syrian and Iraqi civilians. One UN worker was kidnapped for eight months in Syria and was released in October. Another two dozen UN peacekeepers were briefly held this year. It's not clear if those abductions had any relation to al-Golani's letters. Syria's uprising began with peaceful protests, but it turned into an armed uprising after President Assad's forces cracked down on demonstrators. Since then, hard-line Islamic brigades have emerged as the strongest rebel forces in Syria, chiefly among them the Nusra Front. Risks: A Syrian who fled fighting stands by a sign for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon . Under al-Golani's leadership, it has dominated rebel-held parts of southern Syria, and it is a powerful fighting force in the Damascus countryside and northern Syria, with an estimated force of 6,000 to 7,000 fighters. Al-Maliki's Shiite-majority government in Iraq is considered a quiet ally of Assad. The officials may have released the letter excerpts to underscore the dominance of al-Qaida in Syria. The intelligence officials did not where they found the al-Qaida fighters who handed over the documents. They also would not say when the letters were written, though they said it represented a tiny sample of a large cache of documents. The officials couldn't explain why the letter excerpts were in a sloppily written, grammatically incorrect version of an Arabic dialect used across the Levant. It is believed that al-Golani was an Arabic teacher before he rose through al-Qaida's ranks, and typically hard-line Muslims try to write in classical Arabic. It may have been that an aide was writing down al-Golani's speech. Arabs typically speak in dialects that are often quite different from the classical Arabic. 'The claim by Iraqi intelligence that Jolani and by extension, Jabhat al-Nusra, have been behind an explicit policy of kidnapping UN workers should be treated with some suspicion,' Charles Lister, a prominent analyst of Syria's militant groups, said, referring to the Nusra Front by its Arabic name. 'While it might well be true, elements within Iraq's security services have a clear interest in portraying jihadists in Syria and Iraq in a highly negative light.' Little is known about al-Golani, including his real name. He is believed to be 39, and the newly released photograph suggests a man in his thirties. Al-Golani is a nom de guerre, indicating he was born in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The Syrian native joined the insurgency after moving to Iraq. He advanced through al-Qaida's ranks and eventually became a close associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian-born leader of the militant group al-Qaida in Iraq. He eventually returned to Syria shortly after the uprising against Assad began in March 2011, where he formed the Nusra Front, first announced in January 2012. The group gained prominence in April after al-Golani rejected an attempted takeover of the Nusra Front by another rival al-Qaida group, now known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Iraqi intelligence officials said it was members of that group who gave them the information about al-Golani.","Iraqi spies release letters and first known photo of head of Nusra Front .

"By . James Chapman . and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 16:41 EST, 21 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:17 EST, 22 April 2013 . Unruly: Elizabeth Truss says children in British nurseries are not taught how to behave themselves . Education minister Elizabeth Truss has been criticisied for 'ill-judged' criticism of nurseries after she declared they were producing a generation of toddlers with no manners. Ms Truss condemned ‘chaotic’ pre-schools that allow children to do what they want all day long, leaving them unable to sit still and listen by the time they get to primary school. But industry bodies today said her remarks did not chime with experiences in nurseries across the country. In an interview with the Daily Mail, Miss Truss said many nurseries were filled with toddlers ‘running around with no sense of purpose’. She called for a traditional approach akin to that found in France, where children typically start working with a graduate-level teacher from the age of two and are expected to say ‘hello’ when an adult enters the room. In the Commons today she defended her remarks, telling MPs: 'It is a very sad fact that 33 per cent of children arrive at school without the requisite communication and language skills that they need to take part in school education.' The minister’s criticism comes as the Government prepares to offer tax breaks to help working parents with the cost of childcare. From 2015, working couples will qualify for tax breaks worth as much as £1,200 a year per child. Some Tory MPs have claimed the scheme discriminates against stay-at-home mothers, but ministers say there is evidence that up to a million women want to work but are put off by nursery or childminder costs. Miss Truss’s intervention suggests the Government believes there is much work to be done to improve the quality of care in nurseries before the tax breaks come into effect. She said education watchdog Ofsted will be expected to mark down pre-school providers who do not take on better-qualified staff and offer children more structure. ‘This isn’t about two-year-olds doing academic work – it’s structured play which teaches children to be polite and considerate through activities which the teacher is clearly leading,’ she said. ‘At the moment fewer than one-third of nurseries employ graduate-level teachers and have structured, teacher-led sessions. We know that’s very beneficial. ‘What you notice in French nurseries is just how calm they are. All of their classes are structured and led by teachers. It’s a requirement. 'They learn to socialise with each other, pay attention to the teacher and develop good manners, which is not the case in too many nurseries in Britain.’ Teaching manners: Children need their days in nurseries structured in order to learn manners as well as how to behave in a classroom in time for primary school . She said of the UK system: ‘Free-flow play is not compulsory, but there is a belief across lots of nurseries that it is. I have seen too many chaotic settings, where children are running around. There’s no sense of purpose. ‘In these settings where there aren’t sufficiently qualified staff, and children are running around, we are not getting positive outcomes. Improving care: Miss truss, a mother-of-two, says nurseries need to better prepare children for school . ‘We want children to learn to listen to a teacher, learn to respect an instruction, so that they are ready for school.’ The married mother of two, who is increasingly tipped for high office, said it was clear that far too many existing nurseries are ‘not good enough’ – and stressed the importance of good preparation for primary school. ‘Children get into the habit of  waiting their turn, of saying hello to the teacher when they come into the room,’ she said. The minister highlighted the Government’s changes to rules on child-to-adult ratios, to encourage nurseries to employ better-paid graduates. Teachers can already look after up to 13 children aged three and four years, compared with just eight for less well-qualified staff. Her intervention will delight parents and educators who believe a more traditional approach is necessary in vital pre-school years. However, it risks angering trade union leaders and those who insist it is best to ‘let children be children’ before they reach primary school. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: 'It is frankly astonishing that the minister in charge of childcare makes such ill-judged, off-the-cuff statements about what she believes is happening in day nurseries and pre-schools. 'The picture the minister paints is not one that would be recognised by anyone who knows anything about child development and learning.' But Purnima Tanuku OBE, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association said: 'We agree with the minister that a chaotic environment is not good for children. 'We believe that learning needs to be age appropriate and support the children’s individual needs. Group led structured learning is important but must be balanced with the opportunity for one-to-one adult:child interaction.' From September, Ofsted will only consider ratings of ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ to be acceptable for nurseries and pre-schools; the ‘satisfactory’ rating will be scrapped and replaced with ‘requires improvement’. Ofsted head Sir Michael Wilshaw recently decried the ‘absolute nonsense’ that more exams are needed to work with animals than young children.","Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss condemned British pre-schools .

It reads: ‘Whoever being engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission...of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets of wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers...shall be fined under this title or imprisoned…’ The way the Absolute Poker boys saw it this was clearly designed to inhibit sports betting and games of chance. Poker was a game of skill. Realistically,  for all their subsequent protestations of innocence, the way they went about establishing the business hardly smacks of transparency. Author Ben Mezrich whose new book tells the previously untold story of a billion dollar empire and its catastrophic collapse . They chose Costa Rica as their base – the location for several similar online business. They recruited a local expert as consultant who, when pressed on the question of legalities, informed them: ‘This is the Wild West.  And I don’t see any sheriff knocking at our door.’ Having found a base they needed to raise $750,000 start up. They found willing investors in Korea. They poured the money into the Caribbean bank and were on the cusp of going live when the bank went under. Mezrich traces their travels from Belize to Korea, Dominica, to Switzerland, Canada, the States and Costa Rica in a bid to raise funds once more. Stepbrothers Scott Tom and Brent Beckley emerge as the most forceful characters, pushing the project on. Red Bull gave way to cocaine, the backroom bar in Missoula where the idea was born gave way to the fleshpots of Del Rey. Girls were easy and labour was cheap. These guys weren’t internet geeks like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Reddit’s Adam Schwartz or Tumblr’s David Karp. They were frat brothers keen to cash in and fund a wild lifestyle. And for a while they really did. By January 2005 Absolute Poker was valued at thirty million dollars and bringing in about $800,000 a day in revenue. Its founders drove fast cars, raced Ducati and BMW bikes and partied hard. But other sites were growing too and some threatened to dwarf Absolute Poker. By the end of 2006 they recognized two needs: they had to ‘gray it up’ and ‘look clean and pretty.’ Absolute Poker had two years of audited accounts. They needed three to take the company public as was their plan; doing so would make them billionaires. Banks were more likely to respect a company that wasn’t entirely run by 25 year olds out of South America. So they set up an office in Vancouver and brought more established shareholders on board.The boys continued to party. The banks continued to make money. The company continued to grow at an outrageous rate. Virtually Unstoppable: Absolute Poker made the friends millionaires in a matter of months but their story didn't end there . By August 2006 the company had grown more by 100 per cent year on year. They were valued at $100million. Another day at the office: Costa Rica was the 'ground zero' of similar online businesses and where Absolute Poker was based - the Wild West, with no sign of a Sheriff . But that same summer congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling and Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA). Canada’s equivalent of the FBI launched an investigation into the company. The net was beginning to close – the ‘gray legal area’ rapidly hardening to black and white. To this day Brent Beckley maintains he did not know that any of the Absolute Poker team were doing anything wrong. He said he’d ‘fooled himself into thinking that what he was doing was okay.’ Inside Story: Straight Flush by Ben Mezrich is out today . But on 15 April 2011 all room for doubt was removed.The FBI had been investigating Absolute Poker and other sites for two years. The Department of Homeland Security had set up a fake payment processing company through which several sites operated, allowing forensic analysis of their finances and, the prosecution argued, attempts to circumvent the law. Eleven people were indicted from sites including Absolute Poker, PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and online payment processors. Charges included bank fraud and money laundering. That only two were indicted from Absolute Poker – brothers Brent and Scott –may have seemed arbitrary but it was hardly something the others were going to contest. Pete Barovich left his cubicle in Absolute Poker the day the site was seized. He left San Jose, Costa Rica soon after. He now lives with his wife and family in Phoenix, Arizona where he runs his own business. Beckley gave himself up but refused to fully co-operate with the prosecution in return for avoiding jail time. Instead he plead guilty to misleading banks and on 21 July 2012 was sentenced to 14 months which he is currently serving in a minimum security prison in Denver, Colorado. Scott was in Antigua where he remains. He is not technically a fugitive as he was not ‘on the run’ but the FBI considers him ‘at large.’ In July 2012 Absolute Poker agreed to pay $731million fine to the US government. But the story does not end quite there. The final card has not yet been played. In December 2012 the Department of Justice’s  Office of Legal Counsel finally and officially clarified its position regarding the Wire Act. The DOJ concluded that the Wire Act only applies to sports betting – just as the boys of Absolute Poker had done more than a decade before.

"By . Lucy Elkins . PUBLISHED: . 16:30 EST, 6 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:30 EST, 6 May 2013 . Self-conscious: Pearl Lowe experienced hair loss and was constantly tired . Designer and former singer Pearl Lowe prides herself on her healthy lifestyle: she gets her five-a-day, eats oily fish regularly, doesn’t drink or smoke and swims every day. She’s also never ill, rarely even catching a cold. So, it didn’t make sense when a few years ago, Pearl, 43, started to feel permanently exhausted, her nails became brittle and her hair was getting thinner. ‘I was feeling awful all the time,’ she says. ‘I had no energy and was dragging myself around. I often felt as if I needed a liedown during the day and was ready for bed in the early evening. I couldn’t think why — I live a really healthy lifestyle. ‘I also felt really down and not myself. As I was only 40, not an old woman, I couldn’t work out what was going on.’ It wasn’t only her lack of energy that bothered her — Pearl, who has four children, also had fairly serious hair loss. This had started after the birth of her son Frankie in 1999 when Pearl was 29. ‘I really noticed it on the sides. In fact, I had a bald patch about 5cm wide on the left side near my temple,’ says Pearl, who lives in Somerset. ‘I would try to cover it with my remaining hair, but that was pretty thin, too. ‘It didn’t get any better over the years, and when I washed it, I could see handfuls coming out at once. ‘It became really noticeable that I had this bald patch and generally thinning hair. If I had something special to attend, I would wear a hairpiece that I would clip into the front or a fake ponytail. I even wore a hairpiece for my wedding. ‘When I did photo-shoots, they would automatically airbrush in extra hair, which was really embarrassing. ‘It does affect how you feel about yourself,’ says Pearl who is married to Supergrass drummer Danny Goffey and was famously once one of the Primrose Hill set, along with Kate Moss and Sadie Frost. Pearl’s thinning hair continued to distress her, but she didn’t see a doctor because she presumed nothing could be done. However, two years ago she sought medical advice about her fading energy levels. Her GP took blood tests, which found . an explanation for her problems: she was anaemic, but more . significantly, she had an underactive thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism, . as it’s known, is a common complaint, affecting at least two in every . 100 people in Britain, though some experts suggest the figure could be . higher as many spend years undiagnosed. Living a fuller life: As well as her medication for hypothyroidism and anemia, Pearl began taking a supplement for her hair loss and says she can see a difference already . The thyroid produces the hormone thyroxine, which helps regulate the body’s metabolism and other key processes. ‘If you have too little, the body’s system runs too slowly. That’s why people with an underactive thyroid gland tend to feel lethargic, feel the cold more, have low moods and are prone to putting on weight,’ says Myles Black, a consultant ear, nose and throat and thyroid surgeon at the London Thyroid Clinic and East Kent Hospitals University Trust. Hair loss is also common. This may be because the condition slows down the normal turnover of cells, which can include new hair cells. Other symptoms include finding your mind works slower than normal, constipation, dry skin and brittle nails, palpitations, aching muscles and irregular or heavy periods. Typically, it’s caused when the body’s own defences turn on it and produce antibodies to attack the thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism is ten times more common in women, possibly because auto-immune conditions tend to affect more women than men. ‘The thyroid gland becomes inflamed and scar tissue forms, which means it is able to pump out less and less thyroxine,’ says Mr Black. Some patients develop it as a result of damage to the thyroid following surgery or radiotherapy, or as a result of side-effects from medication such as lithium. Childbirth can also be a trigger, because it leads to a brief time of having an over-active thyroid gland, which can damage the thyroid and eventually leave it underactive. ‘Most people who go to their doctors complaining of tiredness will be given a standard battery of blood tests, which involves a test to check for levels of thyroxine [also known as T4] and thyroid-stimulating hormone TSH,’ adds Mr Black. If it shows low levels, some doctors then choose to give patients another blood test that measures antibodies to the thyroid gland. If present, it shows that the antibodies have caused the problem. But not everyone who has the symptoms of low thyroid function gets a test. ‘The problem is that it’s mainly women who are affected,’ says Lyn Mynott, chief executive of the charity Thyroid UK. ‘Women go in and the doctor says: “Of course you’re tired and achy — you have young children.” Then they go back years later and the doctor say: “Of course you’re tired and achy — you’re going through the menopause.” ’ The other problem is that women who have had an underactive thyroid may have low moods and sometimes doctors think they are just depressed. ‘We’ve heard from women who have gone to their doctor and the doctor focuses on the low mood,’ says Lyn. ‘Actually, they aren’t depressed — their low mood is due to hypo- thyroidism, so they end up taking antidepressants unnecessarily.’ Pearl, pictured with her model daughter Daisy, experienced such severe hair loss she had a bald patch . Another complication is that people’s needs for thyroxine differ. While some develop almost no symptoms even though they have low thyroxine levels, others have symptoms of hypothyroidism even when they are on the borderline of a healthy thyroxine level. Once diagnosed, treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine tablets. When Pearl was diagnosed, the doctor explained that as well as low energy and low mood, it could have explained why she had suffered a miscarriage three years earlier. Studies have linked hypothyroidism to an increased risk of miscarriage. ‘At the time I was devastated,’ says Pearl. ‘It also explained why I was struggling to lose weight. I had been really skinny, but had gradually put on a stone and couldn’t shift it.’ ‘Levothyroxine tablets have helped my energy and mood no end. I felt like my old self again. But it didn’t do much for my hair.’ This could have been down to her anaemia as well as an underactive thyroid. Anaemia is a key trigger for hair loss in women, says Dr Bessam Farjo, a hair transplant surgeon who works in London and Manchester. ‘I ask every woman who comes to me for help with hair loss to first have a blood test to rule out an underlying medical condition such as hypothyroidism, which could trigger it,’ he says. ‘However, the most common cause by far to be picked up this way in women is anaemia. This is because iron is needed to help make protein and hair is essentially dead protein.’ A friend suggested Pearl try a supplement called Viviscal, which contains iron, vitamin C, silica and a marine protein complex. ‘I started taking it only six months ago and my hair feels so much fuller,’ says Pearl, who is the mother of model Daisy Lowe, 24. A multi-centre study suggested the supplement may thicken hair and reduce shedding. When 72 women with hair loss were given it or a placebo, those who had the supplement had reduced shedding and their hair shaft width increased after three months. The full study will be published later this year. Meanwhile, Pearl is happy to finally have ‘everything sorted’. ‘I don’t feel like a tired old woman any more, and my hair no longer gets me down.’ Viviscal (£49.95), viviscal.co.uk; Thyroid UK, thyroiduk.org.uk.","Despite a healthy lifestyle, Pearl Lowe experienced sudden hair loss .

Facebook pioneer Sean Parker's extravagant wedding to Alexandra Lenas is in jeopardy after California planning officials launched an investigation into the elaborate construction for the nuptials. The 33-year-old billionaire has been planning an extravagant ceremony based on HBO hit, Game Of Thrones, at the Ventana Inn & Spa in Big Sur on June 1. However, the wedding - estimated to cost upwards of $10 million - is being investigated by Monterey County planners and the state Coastal Commission, the Carmel Pine Cone reported. And today, a source admitted to MailOnline that because of all the fuss, Sean was 'considering various options.' Getting hitched: Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook, is marrying singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas this summer . Brace yourselves: One observer said the wedding could turn into a 'Game of Thrones' fantasy re-enactment . Parker is marrying Alexandra, a . singer and songwriter with whom he has a two-month-old daughter, Winter . Victoria, after a two-year engagement. He had . reportedly hired a landscaping company to build fake ruins, waterfalls, . bridges and a gated cottage in the surrounding woods at Ventana Inn in . Big Sur, California. And the wedding was meant to be no holds barred as the price tag for plants and flowers is believed to be $1 million, while a $350,000 dance floor is also being built. The construction, however, appears to have drawn the ire of California Coastal Comission. “We have opened a code enforcement investigation on Ventana Inn,” Monterey County planning director Mike Novo told the Pine Cone. Neither the Ventana or Parker or his people have applied for permits, . Novo said. One of the wedding’s contractors told county officials . everything would be torn down after the wedding. Associate county planner Joseph Sidor said the state coastal commission is investigating as well. Parker, the founder of Napster, has hired “Lord of the Rings” costume designer Ngila Dickson to create outfits for the guests, he said on Facebook. The New York Post reported that the save-the-date cards for the June 1 wedding look like wizard scrolls. However, this week, a source told MailOnline that because of a string of leaks, the couple arenow 'strongly considering an alternate plan which would happen at . a different location in pebble beach'. And the source added today: 'Sean is considering various options.' Playing dress-up: For Halloween, Parker dressed as Justin Timberlake, who played him in the movie 'The Social Network.' Lenas went as Britney Spears . In 2011, the pair dressed as victims from the Alfred Hitchcock film 'The Birds' Game of Thrones is a popular Medieval fantasy TV show on HBO that features knights and dragons and sorcery. Parker . is worth an estimated $2billion after becoming the founder of Napster . and other tech start-ups and working with Facebook creator Mark . Zuckerberg during the early days of the social network. He was portrayed in the 2008 movie 'The Social Network' by Justin Timberlake, though he has taken issue with how his character was portrayed. Parker proposed to Lenas, a singer-songwriter, in February after she gave birth to the couple's daughter, Winter Victoria Parker. The fantasy wedding won't be the first time the the couple has played dress-up together. They have been pictured during previous Halloween parties dressed as Justin Timberlake and Brittney Spears and as a gruesome duo from the Alfred Hitchcock film 'The Birds.' Meanwhile, this week it was revealed Sean and Alexandra are now living at the Plaza hotel in New York while their Greenwich Village townhouse is being renovated - and will be there for more than a year.

More than 100,000 extra people are expected to sign up to become organ donors next year after a change to the way the public are asked to join the register. Researchers found that people are far more likely to sign up if they are encouraged to think selfishly. In a trial, more than one million people renewing their tax disc or registering for a driving licence online were presented with one of eight messages encouraging them to join the organ donor register. Test: Researchers found that people are far more likely to sign up if they are encouraged to think selfishly . It was found that people were most likely to sign up if warned that they might need a transplant themselves one day. The most successful question was: ‘If you needed an organ transplant, would you have one? If so, please help others.’ People were also more likely to register when presented with the negative warning that three people die every day because of a shortage of donors, than when given the positive message that becoming a donor will help to save lives. Polls show that eight out of ten adults in Britain support organ donation. However, only one person in three is on the donor register. Just over one million signed up last year and more than 19million are now registered. Happy: Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said he was pleased that the Behavioural Insights Team have examined how to improve sign-up rates . Ministers asked the Government’s Behavioural Insights team to find the best way of boosting donations. In a five-week trial, those one million people renewing their tax disk or registering for a driving licence online were presented with one of eight different messages encouraging them to join the organ donation register.Each variant was prefixed with the call to 'Please join the NHS Organ Donor Register'. In order of effectiveness, the questions were: . Those seeing the top message were one third more likely to sign up than those seeing the bottom two messages. The . simple message Please Join the NHS Organ Donor Register, which has been . used for years, came seventh out of the eight messages. The . least successful message was: ‘Every day thousands of people who see . this page decide to register’ which was accompanied by a picture of a . smiling crowd. Not much better performing was the slogan: ‘You could save or transform up to nine lives as an organ donor.’ On average people who saw the warning that they might need to receive an organ donation one day were one-third more likely to sign up than those who saw the original text or the group of people. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said: ‘Since they were established after the 2010 General Election, the Behavioural Insights Team have worked to improve our public services and save hardworking taxpayers’ money. ‘This study shows yet again that what they do can make a real difference. Organ donation can transform people’s lives so I’m pleased that the team have examined how we can improve sign-up rates.’ Professor Anthony Warrens, President of the British Transplantation Society, said: ‘We have a responsibility to help people understand what an amazing act it is to donate organs and how it can transform the lives of so many others and we very warmly welcome publication of this study on how to improve the way we ask people to join the Organ Donor Register. ‘We know that 82 per cent of people in England would definitely donate or consider donating one or more of their organs. ‘We hope this new approach of asking people in a way that creates an appropriately positive and engaged mood will mean that a much larger number of them will convert that support into active registration.’","People most likely to sign up if warned they might need transplant one day .
