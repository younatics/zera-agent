"By . Associated  Press Reporter . An Atlantic City casino is suing a big-time gambler, claiming he won $9.6 million in a card-cheating scheme in baccarat. The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against Phillip Ivey Jr., who is considered one of the best poker players in the world. The lawsuit alleges Ivey and an associate exploited a defect in cards made by a Kansas City manufacturer that enabled them to sort and arrange good cards in baccarat. The technique gave him an unfair advantage on four occasions between April and October 2012, the casino asserted in its lawsuit. Scroll down for video . The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa is suing Phillip 'Phil' Ivey Jr, claiming he cheated the house out of $9.6 million in a game of baccarat. Ivey is seen here in Las Vegas in July 2009 . The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City (pictured) says the alleged cheating happened between April and October 2012 . Baccarat is a comparing card game played between two hands, the player and the banker. Each baccarat coup has three possible outcomes: player (player has the higher score), banker, and tie . The casino claims the technique, called edge sorting, violates New Jersey casino gambling regulations. Its senior vice president, Joe Lupo, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Ivey's lawyer also declined to comment on Friday. The lawsuit claims the cards, manufactured by Gemaco Inc., were defective in that the pattern on the back of them was not uniform. The cards have rows of small white circles designed to look like the tops of cut diamonds, but the Borgata claims some of them were only a half diamond or a quarter of one. The company is also fighting a lawsuit from another Atlantic City casino, the Golden Nugget, claiming the firm provided unshuffled cards that led to gamblers beating the casino for $1.5 million. Gemaco did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit claims that Ivey and his companion instructed a dealer to flip cards in particular ways, depending on whether it was a desirable card in baccarat. The numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9 are considered good cards. Bad cards would be flipped in different directions, so that after several hands of cards, the good ones were arranged in a certain manner â€” with the irregular side of the card facing in a specific direction â€” that Ivey could spot when they came out of the dealer chute. Phil Ivey takes part  in  the 2007 Aussie Millions Poker Championships at the Crown Casino in Melbourne, Australia. Ivey has been accused of cheating . The lawsuit claims Ivey wanted the cards shuffled by an automatic shuffling machine, which would not alter the way each card was aligned. A lawsuit filed in Britain's High Court by the Malaysia-based Genting Group, a major casino operator, makes a similar claim against Ivey. It alleges Ivey and an accomplice amassed almost $12 million by cheating at baccarat. In that case, Ivey has denied any misconduct. Ivey has won nine World Series of Poker bracelets. He compares himself on his website to Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and Muhammad Ali.","Phillip Ivey Jr. being sued by the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The tragic story of an 18-year-old girl from a prominent family in Florida overdosing on prescription pain medication just 18 months after her parents first realized she had a drug problem has inspired a short film about addiction that made its debut at the Sarasota Film Festival last week, and serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of drug use. Brandi Meshad - a graduate of the posh Out-of-Door Academy who'd been accepted at the University of Alabama with dreams of becoming a broadcast journalist - died in 2011 from on overdose of prescription painkillers at the age of 18. Journals kept by the successful student revealed her daily struggle to kick her addiction in the months leading up to her death - and serve as inspiration for the short film cryptically titled No Real Than You Are by Vince Dale, an aspiring filmmaker. Tragic: Brandi Meshad (left) lost her battle with prescription drugs in 2011. Her mother, Lisa (right), has since tried to spread awareness of the dangers of opiates . Potential: Brandi did well in school and had been accepted to the University of Alabama with dreams of becoming a broadcast journalist . Dale says that the film tries to tell the story of his hometown - Sarasota - through one of the common themes currently plaguing much of southern Florida: Addiction to prescription drugs like Oxycontin and roxicodone, the opiates of choice for Meshad. The cryptic title of the film comes from words written on the front of a giant Lego doll that washed up on the beaches in Sarasota in 2011 - on the front of the doll, the words No Real Than You Are are printed in white type. According to Dale, Meshad's story is similar to a lot of stories about addiction in Sarasota - it can sometimes go unnoticed until it's too late. 'The first time we realized she was using until she died was an 18-month . period,' Brandi's mother, Lisa, told the Herald-Tribune. 'For most of that time she was . sober â€” and that's the scary part.' Prior to her prescription pill use, Meshad had dabbled with alcohol use, but no more or less than your standard high school seniors. Meshad first started using Oxycontin when she was given a few pills by a friend to help her sleep. She ultimately spiraled out of control with the drug and was found dead in her grandparents' home on March 8, 2011. Her journal entries tell the story of the slippery slope of addiction to prescription pain medication that ultimately ended with her death. 'Addiction isn't any ordinary monster,' Brandi wrote in journal entries shared with the Herald-Tribune. 'It's like a giant octopus weaving its tentacles not just around you but through you, squeezing not hard enough to kill you, but enough to keep you from feeling until you try to get away. Signs: Lisa Meshad says Brandi's behavior began to get erratic in the moths leading up to her untimely death . 'Try, and you hunger for its grasping clutch ... your need intensifying exponentially every minute you refuse to admit its being.' Meshad's rebellious side began the summer before she started her senior year of high school - according to her mother, the teenage girl had declared her 'right to party.' As she sank further into the depths of addiction, Meshad's behavior went from disinterested to eccentric, often throwing erratic tantrums - and the fights with her mother began to happen more frequently. 'Pills were the new best friend,' Meshad said. 'Mom is the enemy now.' Meshad's mother says she thought the change in behavior was due to a divorce she'd been going through with Brandi's father - she didn't suspect drugs. 'A lot of parents who go through this, you enter this place of denial,' she said. 'You know something's off, but then they can look at you and . say, 'You're crazy, Mom. I'm fine,' and you believe that. Denial in . itself is very wicked.' In September of 2009, Meshad's parents made her take a drug test. They were shocked when she tested positive for opiates and Xanax. Inspiration: Director Vincent Dale has used Brandi's story as inspiration for his short film about addiction . Sasha: The character of Sasha in Dale's short film is based on Brandi and shows the horrors of addiction . 'We were just shocked,' her mother said. 'Teens have this idea that prescription drugs are safer because you don't think your parents or the police can tell, but the danger is that these drugs can kill you on your first try. There's no recreational oxy user.' Lisa Meshad has used the tragedy of losing her daughter to spread the word about the dangers of prescription pain medication, as well as lobbied the Florida Legislature for stricter laws about prescription pain medication. 'We don't have a recovery story, but we want others to have it,' Lisa Meshad said. Dale's film focuses on a girl named 'Sasha.' There are many differences between the character of Sasha and Brandi Meshad - Sasha injects her drugs while Brandi typically snorts hers - but the story of the pain caused by addiction is representative of many stories in southern Florida. 'I don't think anyone who grew up in Sarasota could avoid having friends . or people they know who start to develop problems with opiates and . other drugs,' the film's cinematographer, Sebastian Baron, told the Herald-Tribune. Lisa Meshad has seen the movie. '[After watching the movie] I immediately wrote [Dale] and told him I was speechless,' Lisa said. 'I . think in a beautiful way it really showed how quickly a beautiful life . can end.' However, she says, the fight against addiction is often a losing battle. 'I think in Sarasota we've done an incredible job of raising . awareness and doing something about the pill mills,' Lisa said. 'But do I . think it's changed the number of people of all ages who are addicted? No.'","Brandi Meshad died in 2011 at age 18 after a battle with an addiction to painkillers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Pennsylvania family has faced more than its share of grief this week as a 4-year-old boy was killed after attending the funeral of his father, who was murdered last weekend. Little Karder Hardy was hit by a car and killed on Saturday after returning from the funeral of his father, Derrick Brown, who was fatally shot in Chester, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. Authorities say the boy had exited a Dodge Charger at 11th and Upland streets about 5 p.m. Saturday after returning from the funeral. Tragic: 4-year-old Karder Hardy was killed after getting hit by a car on Saturday . According to witnesses, the boy jumped out of the backseat to run to his mother, whom he'd seen standing across the street. As the boy ran across the street, he was hit by a white van, according to witnesses. 'I seen him laying on the ground and I was holding him and telling him . to hold on, hold on Karder,' Denise Brown, his great aunt, told NBCPhiladelphia.com. The boy was rushed to Crozer-Chester Medical Center with severe head trauma. His injuries, however, were fatal - he was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. The van's 42-year-old driver stopped and remained at the scene of the accident. After the driver was questioned by police, it was determined that the tragedy was a terrible accident. Victim: Authorities believe the boy's father, Derrick Brown, was an innocent bystander when he was fatally shot last week . Brown - the boy's father - was fatally shot while in the city's West End. Investigators say he was likely an innocent bystander who was caught in the crossfire.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former Marine incarcerated in Iran in 2011 and sentence to death on espionage charges was secretly retried and given a 10-year prison term, his new lawyer said. Amir Hekmati has escaped death by being convicted of a new crime - practical collaboration with the American government - by a revolutionary court in December, after being caught working for the CIA. The lawyer, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, also said his client had never been informed about the retrial, conviction or sentence, according to The New York Times. Tabatabaei - who is well-connected to Iran's highest leaders - said he learned of the information in discussions with judiciary officials. Scroll down for video . Iran charged Amir Hekmati with receiving special training and serving at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before heading to Iran for an alleged mission. Hekmati has always maintained his innocence and said she was visiting relatives in Tehran when he was arrested. His death sentence has now been overturned . Hekmati is a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen born in Arizona. His father, a professor at a community college in Flint, Michigan, has said his son is not a CIA spy . He then called Hekmati - who is incarcerated in Tehran’s Evin prison - and Hekmati’s family members in Flint, Michigan, who have long fought for his freedom. The Times reported the news if the first status update of Hekmati's case in over two years. Hekmati, 30, an American of Iranian descent who had been visiting relatives in Tehran for the first time when he was arrested more than two and a half years ago, has repeatedly asserted his innocence. American officials say they have raised the issue in all encounters with members of the Iranian government. But as of Friday, neither Hekmati nor his lawyer had received any written confirmation of the December conviction or sentence — not an uncommon occurrence in Iran’s legal system, which has been criticized by rights groups and the United Nations for what they call its secret, arbitrary and extrajudicial procedures. However Tabatabaei has expressed confidence about the accuracy of the information. The niece of Amir Hekmati joins the fight to free him. In Iran Hekmati's case is considered high profile and important for the direction of future relations with the United States . He also suggested that Hekmati could possibly be freed in a matter of months, particularly if the United States government released at least some Iranian prisoners, in order to start 'removing misunderstandings'. He did not specify any of these prisoners by name or alleged offense. The Department of Justice says 38 Iranian citizens are currently incarcerated in federal prisons for a range of offenses, mostly on fraud and drug charges but also on smuggling, burglary and violations of national security laws. Inside Iran, Mr. Hekmati’s case is viewed as highly political. He is considered a pawn in domestic infighting between hard-liners, who want him in prison, and moderates who want him freed as a good-will gesture to the United States.","Amir Hekmati, 31, is a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen born in Arizona and based in Michigan .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . and Associated Press . An 86-year-old New York City man who called 911 and said he shot his daughter was fatally shot by responding officers on Saturday. The man turned toward the officers with a shotgun and refused to drop it when they arrived, police said. Jack Calvello was shot once in the torso by a uniformed police officer following the 11:16 a.m. call to his Astoria, Queens home and was pronounced dead at a hospital, police said. Calvello reportedly called 911 and said 'I shot my daughter and my dog' before saying he planned to shoot himself, the New York Daily News reports. Calvello's 65-year-old daughter, Carolann Matyka, was found with a gunshot wound to the head in the kitchen of the red-brick home and rushed to a hospital where she was pronounced dead at 3:45 p.m., police said. Scene: The shooting reportedly took place at Calvello's Astoria, Queens home, pictured . Crime: Police are seen in the area outside of Calvello's home. Calvello reportedly called 911 saying he shot his daughter and her dog . A loaded 12-gauge shotgun was recovered from the scene, according to investigators. It wasn't immediately clear what sparked the incident. Two teenage boys playing basketball near the home, Bryan Garcia and Eric Soto, told the Daily News they saw Calvello come out of the house's doorway pointing the shotgun at the two officers and then heard police tell him to drop the weapon before the shot was fired. 'When they shot him, it made us shake,' Soto, 15, said. 'At that point we covered our heads and ran; we were terrified.' 'That was the first time weâ€™ve seen someone die, so it was terrifying,' Garcia said. Weapon: Jack Calvello, 86, reportedly faced responding officers with this 12-gauge shotgun . Matyka's brown Yorkshire terrier named Jack suffered a neck injury, but was expected to survive, according to the paper. Police said it was believed to have been shot as well. Realtor Dean Rocco, 29, told the Daily News that Calvello was a Vietnam veteran and bought his house in 1968. Calvello reportedly lived in the basement and his daughter upstairs, while a couple rented another floor in the home. Rocco said he did not witness trouble between Calvello and his daughter. 'I would see them every day. I never saw any kind of altercation between them,' Rocco said. The two responding policemen, a sergeant and a police officer, were unhurt.","Jack Calvello, 86, reportedly called 911 and said 'I shot my daughter and my dog' before saying he planned to shoot himself .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . A Virginia community is searching for answers after six of its students have died in apparent suicides over the last three years. Each of the students attended W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax. County officials said the deaths are not directly connected and that the number of suicides in such a short period is rare, according to a detailed report by the Washington Post. The deaths have troubled parents and administrators since the students did not show typical risk factors and were involved in their communities. Emotional: W.T. Woodson High School students pause for a moment of reflection on Tuesday, March 18, 2014 at The Cav Strong Community Event in Fairfax, Virginia . Grief: W.T. Woodson High School students are seen here during the candlelight portion of the Cav Strong Community Event on March 18. Six Woodson students have died in apparent suicides over the last three years . Parents told the paper that they wonder if a 'high-pressure, high-achieving culture' at the school was a factor in the deaths. Woodson High School is ranked 5th in Virginia and 116th nationally, according to U.S. News and World Report. Both parents and students said they're also concerned over earning spots in Virginia's public higher education system. The paper says the deaths have spurred students to offer yoga classes and train as mental health first responders. The Woodson website now prominently features mental health resources on its front page and reportedly has tried to hire more psychologists and social workers. Heartbreaking: Nick Stuban, pictured, committed suicide in 2011. He was a football player for W.T. Woodson High School . Tragedy: Cameron Kilby, pictured, committed suicide in August 2012. He was a Boy Scout, church acolyte and cross-country runner . Devastating: Bryan Glenn, pictured, was a football player who dreamt of serving in the military. He went missing in October 2012 and his body was found a week later in a park close to W.T. Woodson High School . The string of apparent suicides began in January 2011 when 15-year-old sophomore Nick Stuban killed himself after being disciplined for buying synthetic marijuana, the paper reports. Cameron Kilby, 15, committed suicide on August 4, 2012, just before his sophomore year. He was a Boy Scout, church acolyte and cross-country runner. Senior Bryan Glenn, a football player who dreamt of serving in the military, went missing in October 2012. His body was found a week later in a park less than two miles from the high school. Junior Ethan Griffith, 17, jumped off of a parking garage in April 2012. Jack Chen, 15, died on February 26, 2014, when he was hit by a commuter train. A junior-year student, unidentified by the Post, was found dead the next day. Parents, students, and administrators are trying to understand the deaths at W.T. Woodson High School. Two students reportedly committed suicide in February 2014 . Hope: W.T. Woodson High School students show Cavelier Spirit by creating a ""w"" formation at the Cav Strong Community Event on March 18 . Parents interviewed by the paper expressed their confusion and grief over the deaths. Jim Chen, Jack's father, said he believed his son's skin medication may have been a factor. The unidentified medicine may cause depression. 'There was something going on in his mind, but he didn’t give me any chance to do anything,' Chen said. Chen's suicide note said he 'couldn't keep doing this' and directly referred to apparent pressures he felt at school. 'There is too much stress in my life from school and the environment it creates, expectations for sports, expectations from my friends and expectations from my family,' he wrote. Gayle Griffith, Ethan's mother, said the school ignored signs of her son's depression. She found a paper written by Ethan before his death which included suicidal thoughts. 'If a kid says he’s thought about it or writes about it in a paper, they are supposed to call their team of counselors. But that never happened,' she said. Rosella Glenn, Bryan's mother, criticized the school and said it doesn't have adequate mental health resources. 'How many more need to die before somebody wakes up and realizes there is a situation that warrants bringing in more resources to fight this problem?' Glenn told the Post. 'I’m tired of seeing flowers and signs around Woodson.' Resources: the deaths have spurred students to offer stress-reducing yoga classes and train as mental health first responders . The school said teachers will review respond to suicide warning signs. Fairfax County Board member Megan McLaughlin also told the paper that Woodson High School is talking to students about mental health. 'We absolutely have a responsibility to examine this as closely as possible to understand why this has continued to happen in one particular high school at this rate,' McLaughlin said. 'It’s simply too high.' Christine Moutier, chief medical officer for the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention, expressed concern over a possible suicide contagion among the student body. 'The thing we are always concerned about is the phenomenon of suicide contagion,' Moutier told the Post. 'Youths are more susceptible to contagion, and research has found that 2 to 5 percent of teen suicides had a possible role of contagion. It is a vast minority, but it doesn’t mean the phenomenon doesn’t exist.' In March, Woodson High School reportedly hosted a two-day suicide prevention training program,  according to WJLA. At the time the station described reports of the school being a 'pressure-cooker of sorts when it comes to social and academic performance.' On May 17, the school system is expected to host a countywide mental health event.

Depp, 50, has not commented on the reports. NBC News reported the disturbing incident unfolded in December 2009, when Lekon, then 43, and 25-year-old Sonia Taunauu began arguing about narcotics in an industrial area near Skid Row known for drug dealing.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When it comes to fighting for TV viewers, Twitter and Facebook think they’re pretty important to TV viewers and have spent the last year or so fighting for a piece of advertisers’ budgets. However, new research from the Nielsen-affiliated Council for Research Excellence suggests that most people don't pay any attention to social media at all when they tune in to their favorite shows. The study found that despite shows attempting to build a presence on social media and encourage 'chatter', most are only checking such sites about 16 percent of the time we watch primetime TV shows. Whilst brands put a lot of time and effort into primetime ads when the biggest audience numbers are up for grabs, viewers only end up chatting about the show half the time. Twitter and Facebook still have a long way to go to become part of the mainstream TV consumption experience . Of the 16.1 percent of respondents who claimed to use social media while watching TV, 7.3 reported their social media activity was related to the show they were watching, but 7.8 percent said their social media use was unrelated to a particular TV show . Rethnk possible? Listen to executives at Twitter and Facebook talk about how we watch television and you might walk away thinking that Americans are chattering nonstop on the social networks while watching their favorite shows . Only 16.1 percent of survey respondents claimed to have used social media while watching prime time television. 1,665 . survey participants were instructed to log any social posts about a . prime time TV show, as well as any time they discussed a TV show on . their social networks. The . study’s findings were based on 78,310 diary entries covering nearly . 1,600 shows reported via a mobile app supplied by the research group. The survey found that just 6.8 percent of people tuned into a show because of a social media conversation. That . number was far lower than other, more general factors pushing people to . turn on a show, as about 40 percent said TV commercials sent them to . watch, and 30 percent said they already watched that show previously. The figures may not be wholly convincing for advertising who believe such social media networks are the way to reach their loyal followers. Facebook was most popular with 11.4 percent of survey respondents actively engaging on the network. Twitter users measured almost less than a third of Facebook users . It seems that social media has very little impact on whether people actually watch TV shows . Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has earned billions from his company, which has recently been valued at $150 billion . Twitter’s Amplify program allows broadcasters to send promotional tweets when you begin to talk about a TV show. If . ABC knows you’re tweeting about Dancing With The Stars, it can insert a . promotional tweet in your feed from a particular advertiser. Facebook . also introduced something similar and uses Neilsen data to reach . audience members that it believes are in its target demographic for . advertisers. Of the social . media platforms being used during prime time television viewing, . Facebook was the most popular with 11.4 percent of survey respondents . actively engaging on the network. Twitter . users measured almost less than a third of Facebook users, with only . 3.3 percent of the survey respondents using Twitter during their TV . viewing time. The survey . showed that people only use Facebook to chat about their favorite prime . time show 3.8 per cent of the time and Twitter even less, just 1.8 per . cent. There are anomalies. Award shows appear to draw more social media buzz and the numbers of . users both watching TV and using social media at the same time are . higher. One only needs to look at how popular Ellen's record-breaking Oscar selfie was. Other . shows that reach a climax such as American Idol or the Bachelor, also . generate 'watercooler discussion' more than regular shows. The . Council for Research Excellence surveyed 1,700 people between the ages . of 15 and 54 that were 'representative of the online population.' The data was self-reported using mobile-app diary entries. Despite making a later push into social TV, Facebook performs slightly better on this front. Some 3.8% of primetime viewers in the study used Facebook to talk about the show they were watching at that moment compared to just 1.8% for Twitter . The selfie heard round the world: Ellen's Oscar selfie generated more free buzz and marketing oomph than pretty much anything, ever, in the company's history. The picture is reportedly worth $1 billion . The data shows the type of shows most influenced by social media, with special programs at the top of the list, followed by Sci-Fi and sports shows . The survey confirms a previous . Nielsen study that found social media conversation drives some TV . ratings but that the impact is fairly small. This new study backs up . such findings. The study . found that those who engage on social media about the shows they're . watching tend to be more likely to binge watch programs and consume TV . shows on tablets and smartphones. 'The . majority of viewing remains live and on traditional TV sets, but we do . see that social media has a stronger relationship with the newer . platforms and behaviors,' CRE Social Media Committee chair Beth Rockwood . said. 'This is evidence that social media is an important part of the new ways that people are consuming television content.' Commercials and traditional promos were the top factor in what drew people to watch a particular show with nearly 40% of those surveyed saying this led them to watch a new show. By comparison, just 6.8% of respondents cited social media . Of people who chatted on social media while watching TV, just 3.3 percent did so through Twitter, well below Facebook at 11.4 percent. It's . not to say that viewers are not engaging with social media whilst . watching TV, they are. Just not at the levels that Twitter recently discussed. Social networks essentially twist their data so show the most positive statistics. They promote the 'most-tweeted' shows which are popular amongst the 'most active' users. 'Super . Connectors,' or people who regularly used social media to follow TV . shows or actors, made up 22 percent of the survey respondents.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Daily Mail Reporters . Authorities have announced two more deaths caused when a FedEx tractor-trailer truck crossed a median and slammed into a bus packed with students this week. Best friends Ismeal Jimenez and Denise Gomez have been identified as among the 10 people dead in a fiery wreck that investigators now say happened after the FedEx truck failed to brake in an effort to avoid the horrific accident. Jimenez and Gomez were both seniors at Amino Inglewood Charter School, in Inglewood, according to NBC Southern California. Family members confirmed their deaths to the station. Best friends: Ismael Jiminez and Denise Gomez, both high school seniors, died in the horrific collision . He was an honors student who wanted to be an artist, she wanted to be a lawyer or a teacher, the station reported. Those dreams will be left unfulfilled. 'Heâ€™s in a much better place than this world that we live in,' said Jimenez's sister. 'She loved her family very much, and we all love her very much,' Gomez's aunt lamented. Both were expecting to graduate high school this year. The revelations came as National Transportation Safety Board investigators announced during a Saturday press conference that evidence points to the truck driver making no effort to avoid the crash. 'There are no tire marks anywhere,' an official told the media, according to KRCR. Hard at work: NTSB investigators pour over the wreckage of the semi-truck . The bus driver scrambled to avoid the collision, said the NTSB. Almost 150 feet of brake marks were found on the pavement at an angle that indicated the driver turned away from the truck. Both drivers died in the accident. Investigators plan to examine the truck's transmission to see what gear it was in at impact in an attempt to determine how fast it was traveling. Claims it was on fire prior to the accident have not been able to be corroborated by the NTSB.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Two women have become friends for life after both being struck by an unthinkable tragedy – their teenage daughters each committed suicide after being bullied. Canadians Leah Parsons and Carol Todd struck up a friendship from across the country after their daughters Rehtaeh and Amanda were found dead last year. Each woman knew intimately the pain the other felt, they helped each other in ways no one else could. Todd, of Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, and Parsons, of Peggy’s Cove, Halifax, texted, emailed and spoke on the phone for nearly a year before finally meeting in an emotional visit detailed by the Globe and Mail. Write caption here . Partners in pain: Leah Parsons (left) and Carol Todd (right) became friends under extraordinarily painful circumstances . ‘We know what that pain feels like,’ Ms. Parsons says. ‘We were able to connect and share things that we don’t necessarily share in public, just different things about our daughters.’ ‘It’s weird how tragedy can bring you together,’ Todd added. ‘You can open up a conversation that you can’t open up with anyone else. ‘You can’t talk about the whys and the what-ifs and … what you saw and how you feel with just any other person,’ she continued. ‘Even my closest friends, who haven’t gone through it, can’t talk about it.’ Parsons marked the one year anniversary of her daughter’s sobering April 7 death this week, and Todd greeted her with a text message. ‘How are you holding up? I know how hard it is,’ she wrote. A cry for help: Rehteah Parsons posted of her sadness online . Isolated: Amanda Todd's depression drove her to kill herself . Better times: Rehteah parsons with mother Leah (left) and her father . ‘One more interview tomorrow evening then the walk [in Rehtaeh’s memory],’ Parsons replied, ‘then will crash … I feel an emotional tsunami coming on.’ Todd replied ‘I am here for you.’ Relentless cyberbullying after alleged sexual assaults led both girls to take their own lives – Rehteah Parsons was 17, Amanda Todd 15-years-old. Both girls were popular, cheerleaders and were driven to depression after pictures of the alleged assaults were passed around school and name calling hounded them online, the mothers said.The similarities don’t end there. Amanda Todd was born Nov. 27, which Leah Parsons told the paper was supposed to be her daughter’s due date – Rehteah Parsons was born on Dec 9. Desperate: Parsons was relentlessly bullied online, and began leaving cryptic posts illustrating her sadness . Warning sign: The girl had tried to commit suicide before . Rehteah Parsons hung herself on April 4 – Carol Todd’s birthday. Amanda Todd received the final taunting message on Facebook that drove her over the edge on the same day Rehteah Parsons was reportedly assaulted. Rehteah Parsons showed her mother the documentary about Amanda Todd. ‘She said, ‘Mom, you’ve got to come see this… I am just so upset because nobody cared about her when she was alive,’ the heartbroken mother recalls her daughter saying. Rehteah Parsons was dead a month later. The startling coincidences led Carol Todd to send Leah Parsons a Facebook message after she read a feature on the girl’s ordeal, they connected a month later. Both women have also dealt with the possibility that Amanda Todd’s suicide may have catalyzed Rehteah Parsons urge to go down the same path. They have also talked about the nearly identical path they have each walked the past year. ‘As much as our girls were parallel,’ said Todd, ‘we are parallel, too, in our emotions, our physical health, our tiredness.’ The women talk about other things, but everything always comes full circle. ‘[They] tried so hard to stand up for themselves,’ said Leah Parsons. ‘They were trying to get a message out there. ‘We are here to carry that message forward.’","Leah Parsons and Carol Todd became friends despite living thousands of miles apart .

Awa Fadiga, 23, was attacked about 11pm in a cab taking her home to an upscale neighborhood in the capital, Yamoussoukro, on March 23. Two witnesses say they saw the locally famous fashion model being thrown out of the cab under a bridge, apparently unconscious.

Tragic: Model Awa Fadiga (right, pictured with an unknown man) was rushed to the Central University Hospital where she was allegedly left untreated for more than 12 hours and slipped into a coma . Fadiga's aunt, Sira Kone Fadiga who had raised her since she was five-years-old, said the family heard about the young woman's injuries about 1pm the next day. She . said the hospital refused to provide even basic care until someone came . to pay for Fadiga's treatment, showing bills amounting to around $230 . for everything from medicine to sanitary gloves. 'We found her half-naked on the floor, in a coma. We had to use her grandmother's scarf to hide her breasts,' she said. The . hospital CT scan machine was down that day, so Fadiga's family also had . to pay for transport to a private clinic, Sira Kone Fadiga said. Fadiga's . death was caused by severe head injuries including a skull fracture . sustained during the assault, according to the family and medical . reports. Police are searching for the driver and have shown two portraits of the men who allegedly robbed and attacked Fadiga.

'It is a moment to come together and ask ourselves . what has become of our health care system.'

This sparked a violent crisis in which more than 3,000 people . were killed before President Alassane Ouattara took office. Free . health care was stopped the 1990s because of the country's struggling . economy and pressure from global financial institutions.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Campaigning mother Doreen Lawrence is being tipped as Labour's candidate to fight the London mayoral elections. The party is said to be in early talks about formally approaching the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence to stand in the 2016 vote. Labour insiders believe the 'influential and dynamic' peer would have a broad appeal, according to The Sunday People. Doreen Lawrence, left, is being tipped as the Labour candidate for the London mayoral elections. She could go up against current mayor Boris Johnson, right . In an article for the newspaper, policy coordinator Jon Cruddas wrote: 'She's a class act and going from strength to strength. People in Westminster are -starting to tip her as a potential mayor for our capital city. Now that is an interesting idea.' Earlier this week, Baroness Lawrence was named the most powerful woman in the country in a list compiled for Radio 4's Woman's Hour. Her son, an 18-year-old student, was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south east London, with a friend on April 22 1993. It took more than 18 years to bring two of his killers to justice. Mrs Lawrence's son Stephen, pictured, was stabbed to death in an unprovoked racist attack in 1993 . Baroness Lawrence's tireless campaign for justice for her son led to the Macpherson Inquiry, which found evidence of 'institutional racism' in the Metropolitan Police. Two of his killers were finally convicted of murder in 2012. She founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust to support young people from ethnic minority backgrounds to pursue their ambitions and was made a Labour peer last year. A Labour Party spokeswoman said: 'The Labour Party's selection process for our London Mayoral candidate is not yet under way.'","Party said to be in early talks about approaching Baroness Lawrence .

"By . Nola Ojomu . She came under fire for failing to acknowledge the death of TV rival Peaches Geldof. And on Friday Katie Hopkins finally broke her silence as she explained the reason behind her actions in her latest column for The Sun. Katie also used the column to make a . scathing attack on the current trend for celebrities to flock to their . Twitter accounts to 'outdo each other in public display of distress'. And of course she didn't hesitate to offer her opinion on others who did acknowledge the TV presenter's death, or on what she felt was the real reason behind the tragic event. Scroll down for video . Sharing her thoughts: Katie Hopkins finally broke her silence following the death of Peaches Geldof in her column for The Sun on Friday . The controversial TV personality made it . clear that she felt it would inappropriate to tweet about Peaches when . the deceased mother-of-two wouldn't have appreciated a tweet from her . while she was alive. Writing in her column she said: 'Peaches didn't want a tweet from me. She didn't welcome it in life. She certainly didn't need it in death. 'She was tough enough not to seek approval from anyone.' Gone too soon: The surprising death of the 25-year-old (seen here in 2012) lead to a public outpouring of grief from people around the world . The argumentative reality star surprisingly then paid her old foe a compliment as she added: 'I admire that trait in others.' She went on to question . why people expected to comment on the death of a woman she only met once . on a 'TV sofa in central London', claiming that not only were the pair . strangers but they were enemies following their infamous interaction. She venomously argued that such statements were not sincere and were affecting the way society grieved in public. The mother-of-two explained: 'I refused to be part of this revolting spectacle.' Katie concluded her column stating that just as the world and media should offer the grieving family privacy, she was offering her privacy through her silence on the issue. The moment we met: The pair famously clashed during an appearance on This Morning . She wrote: 'Peaches didn't need tweets from celebrities or strangers - she just needed a mother's love'. Her surprising words came too late as it was revealed that the reality star's scheduled appearance on Celebrity Juice on Thursday night was postponed due to the controversy surrounding Katie after Peaches' death. The news was announced on the official Twitter account with a message that read: 'Hi Celebrity Juice Fans, Katie Hopkins appearance on the show has been postponed until the Autumn'. Katie linked to the tweet with her own comment which read: 'I apologise for this decision guys - and look forward to joining Celeb Juice in September.' Loss: Peaches leaves behind husband Thomas Cohen and two sons Astala and Phaedra . When the show's host, Leigh Frances (better known by his alter ego, Keith Lemon), was flooded with tweets from fans, he replied to one user: 'said it before many many times I don't book the guests'. Police found Peaches' body at home in Wrotham, Kent, at 1.35pm on Monday and described the death as 'sudden' and 'unexplained'. Peaches was found dead at the home she shared with her husband Thomas Cohen and their two sons, Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months. Police described her death as 'unexplained' and a post-mortem proved inconclusive. It could take up to three weeks for the results of toxicology reports could be used to try and find the cause of her passing. Her body has been released to the family as they make funeral arrangements. I respect you: Katie paid Peaches a surprising compliment as she revealed that the mother-of-two wasn't someone who seeked approval from others .",Katie's scheduled appearance on Thursday night's Celebrity Juice was postponed in wake of criticism .
"By . Robert Verkaik . Undercover: The MI5 agent pictured during a terror trial in Brussels in 2003 . An MI5 agent who infiltrated terrorist cells and worked on the investigation into the 7/7 bombings has been granted police protection after becoming the target of death threats by Islamic extremists in Britain. The 33-year-old Moroccan-born undercover agent worked for MI5 for six years – risking his life to  prevent terror attacks on the UK. Despite this, the Government has refused to allow him to stay indefinitely in Britain. But now it has emerged that his . identity has been compromised and Islamic extremists in the UK have made . death threats against him. One . threat was made by someone in a prison and another by extremists . meeting at a Central London shisha bar. Scotland Yard has installed a . panic button in the man’s home and officers patrol the streets outside. There are plans to move him to a secret address and the security bill could reach £50,000 a year. The . agent infiltrated Islamic extremist cells, worked on the investigations . into the 7/7 bus and Tube attacks on London and the Madrid train . bombings as well as providing vital intelligence which led to the arrest . of Al Qaeda suspects. His vital work was praised by Tony Blair. But . after leaving MI5 in 2006, he has had to live a double life, unable to . tell anyone about his work with the Security Service. And although he has lived in the UK since 1999, the Home Office has refused to grant him a permanent right to remain in the UK. Report: How the Mail on Sunday broke the story back in 2007 . The man claims this has made it harder for him to lead a new life away from the scrutiny of extremists. The . Mail on Sunday can also reveal that his case is being investigated by . the Investigatory Powers Tribunal which holds the security and . intelligence services to account. The . investigation will look at whether MI5 broke the law when they . recruited the man and whether they failed to protect him after he . stopped working for them. He . also has a case before the immigration tribunal, which will review the . Home Secretary’s decision not to grant him the permanent right to remain . in the UK. In a second case, he is suing the Government for breaches of its duty of care. The . man, who married a British citizen with whom he has a five-year-old . daughter, left Morocco when he was 15 and arrived in the UK three years . later after travelling across Europe. He . stayed at the Finsbury Park Mosque where he met radical preacher Abu . Hamza, whose followers sent him to Georgia and then Chechnya. London bombings: The wreck of the Number 30 double-decker bus is pictured in Tavistock Square in central London . According . to legal papers seen by The Mail on Sunday, he says that when he . returned to the UK in 2000 he was approached by MI5 and recruited. In December 2001, he was sent to Belgium to infiltrate an extremist . cell but was  arrested and held for two years in solitary confinement . without charge. In January . 2004, he claims he was visited by an MI5 officer who told him that then . Home Secretary David Blunkett had authorised his transfer to the UK. He . says he was offered the choice of remaining in prison in Belgium, . returning to Morocco where he claims he faced arrest and torture, or . continuing his work with MI5. He . was then sent to a house in Swansea where he was trained how to be a . spy. He was shown how to use fake credit cards, how to infiltrate . extremist groups without raising suspicions and how to interact with his . MI5 handlers. During the . investigation into the 2004 Madrid bombings, which killed 191 people, he . provided vital intelligence on the kind of detonation system used. On . the day of the 7/7 bus and Tube attacks on London the following year, . he helped to track down extremists linked to the bombers. He claims he was repeatedly told by MI5 that Mr Blunkett and Mr Blair were very pleased with his work. During . his time with MI5, he says he was paid £300 a week, given housing . benefit and had meetings with his MI5 handlers every three days. When . he was working on important missions he was taken to meet senior MI5 . officers in a safe house, 15 minutes from Waterloo Station in London. Blindfolded in the back of a van, he was driven to a top-secret building which was sound-proofed and had tinted windows. But in February 2006, he was told that the relationship was being  terminated because MI5 felt he was no longer any use to them. Mr . Blunkett has denied having any knowledge of the case. But the man’s . lawyer, Christophe Marchand, said: ‘They told him that if he agreed to . work for MI5 he would have a new life in the UK. 'But . he was very vulnerable at this time, he was young and held in solitary . confinement where he was psychologically weak. He believed he had no . choice.’","33-year-old Moroccan-born undercover agent worked for MI5 for six years .

"Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans has said that he could not have survived his court ordeal without the help of Coronation Street stars William Roache and Vicky Entwistle. The independent MP - who was cleared of cleared of rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted sexual assault and two indecent assaults - has also admitted that he considered suicide during the trial. He said that 81-year-old star Mr Roache, who was also cleared of sexual assault charges, helped him through the darkest time of his life. Scroll down for video . Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans has said that he could not have survived his court ordeal without the help of Coronation Street stars Bill Roache and Vicky Entwistle . Mr Evans told the Sunday Mirror that Mr Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in ITV soap Coronation Street, sent him a text after he learned that he had been acquitted. He said it read: 'Just heard. Well done. And quite right too. The champagne will flow, xx.' Mr Evans was also supported throughout the case by Coronation Street actress Vicky Entwistle, who played Janice Battersby in the ITV soap. He said: 'Without my friends being there for me and giving me hope I would have been a broken man.' Mr Evans said that 81-year-old star Roache, pictured middle in glasses, who was also cleared of sexual assault charges, helped him through the darkest time of his life . He said that he and Mr Roache had exchanged messages during their trials, adding: 'That kind of absolute belief was what kept me going, not just from famous friends like Bill but from constituents and my family.' The MP for Lancashire’s Ribble Valley was arrested in May. It came after a member of staff accused him of rape after a night of what he believed to be consensual sex. Later he was charged with eight other sexual offences against male colleagues between 2002 and 2013. Mr Evans was also supported throughout the case by Coronation Street actress Vicky Entwistle, who played Janice Battersby in the ITV soap . The MP, who stepped down as Deputy Speaker to fight the case at a personal cost of £200,000, wept as the jury found him not guilty, saying: 'Thank you' In the interview he also said that the experience has made him more wary. He said: 'I will be on my guard. I will worry when I go to touch someone. I’m afraid someone out there will try to set me up so I’ve now got to be aware on may levels as to how I behave.' When asked if he had considered suicide, in an earlier interview, he said: ‘Yes, in my darkest moments. The pressure and despair were so great.' Mr Evans, 56, mentioned Mr Roache as he spoke of his relief on the steps of Preston Crown Court after being cleared of rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted sexual assault and two indecent assaults. He had earlier stood in the dock, hands clasped in front of him, listening to each not guilty verdict. By the time he was cleared of the eighth count he couldn't contain his emotions no longer, his face crumpled and he began to weep, wiping away his tears with a white tissue. As he was cleared of the ninth and final count his supporters in the gallery let out a gasp of relief and burst into tears. The MP, who stepped down as deputy speaker to fight the case at a personal cost of £200,000, wept as the jury found him not guilty, saying: ‘Thank you.’ Outside court Mr Evans said he had gone through ‘11 months of hell’ and it was no time for celebration . He added: ‘Bill Roache just a few weeks ago from this very spot said there are no winners in these cases and that’s absolutely right. 'All I can say is that after the last 11 months that I’ve gone through, nothing will ever be the same again.’ For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Coronation Street stars supported him throughout rape accusation ordeal .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Agnetha Faltskog and husband Bjorn Ulvaeus in 1978 . Our Eurovision Song Contest acts over recent years have suffered the ignominy of propping up the table and even scoring the dreaded ‘nul points’. But according to Abba star Bjorn Ulvaeus, the UK could triumph in the competition once again – if we just came up with a decent song. Bjorn, who co-wrote his band’s 1974 winning entry Waterloo, said: ‘I still like to think that the best song wins.’ He also urged the country’s best songwriters to get behind the contest and ignore the ‘stigma’ associated with it. The UK has not won Eurovision since 1997 when Katrina and the Waves triumphed with Love Shine A Light. Rock veteran Bonnie Tyler had to settle for 19th place last year with her song Believe In Me, and our worst result was  in 2003 when Jemini failed  to record a single point. Unknown Molly Smitten-Downes will be flying the flag at this year’s contest in Copenhagen  on May 10. Sir Terry Wogan, who presented the TV coverage of the event for nearly 30 years, dismissed claims that the UK was doomed to fail because of partisan voting by East European countries and said all the UK needed was a chart-topping act to take part. ‘If we could put Take That on stage, we would have an outstanding chance,’ he said.

"Delighted Stacey Hobden carries daughter Madison, two, after battling back from a rare and crippling illness . A mother has told of her joy at being able to carry her daughter again for the first time since she was a baby, after being struck down by a rare and crippling illness. Stacey Hobden, 22, from West Denton, Newcastle, was left semi-paralysed after contracting the nervous system disorder Guillian-Barre syndrome over a year ago. The disease, which affects just one in 100,000 people, caused her to loose all feeling in her hands and feet and left her unable to walk. But worst of all it meant she was unable to care for daughter Madison, who was then just nine -months-old. But after battling back for over a year, Mrs Hobden has finally regained the strength to carry Maddison, now two, for the first time. She said: 'Words can't describe how I feel to be able to hold Maddison. 'It's almost like having a part of myself back. I haven't been able to hold her since she was seven months old. 'At long last I just feel like I can be a mam again.' Mrs Hobden caught an apparently relatively harmless sickness bug but when she was unable to fight it off she was admitted to hospital. Two weeks later, after a battery of tests, the mother-of-one was diagnosed with the disease, which not only left her unable to walk, but also affected her so much that she could not even hold Madison. She is currently attending Walkergate Park Centre in the East End of Newcastle, where she is undergoing intensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation work with the medical and nursing staff. She said: 'I'm getting much better now and I can walk around the house. I am still not back to the way I was but I'm using my mobility scooter to get out and about outside.' Mrs Hobden and her husband Paul, 26, originally from Brighton, met seven years ago and had tried for a baby for five years. Come on mum: The disease, which affects just one in 100,000 people, caused Mrs Hobden to loose all feeling in her hands and feet and left her unable to walk . But agonisingly, the qualified nursery nurse suffered 14 miscarriages. The couple were delighted when she then gave birth to Maddison. Mrs Hobden, who already suffered from fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body, spent eight weeks at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary. She is now hoping to set up a charity which offers help to other people in the region suffering from Guillian-Barre syndrome. She said: 'There just doesn't seem to be anything out there to support people at our age with Guillian-Barre syndrome.' Guillain-Barré is a rare and unusual condition that occurs when the body's immune system attacks parts of the nervous system. The exact cause of the syndrome is unknown, but symptoms usually begin to develop one to three weeks after a minor infection, such as a cold or sore throat. The symptoms, which include pain, tingling and numbness and muscle weakness, often start in the feet and hands before spreading to thearms and then your legs. Sufferers may also experience co-ordination problems and unsteadiness. The weakness normally affects both sides of the body and it may get worse over several days. Most sufferers (around 80 per cent) make a full recovery. However that can involve spending weeks in hospital and it may take a year or more to fully recover. About one or two people in every 10 will not recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, although others can make a full recovery. Long-term complications include not being able to walk unaided, a loss of sensation, loss of balance and muscle weakness in the arms or legs.","Stacey Hobden, left helpless after contracting Guillian-Barre syndrome .

"By . Simon Watkins . Co-operative Group committee member Munir Malik at the start of Co-operatives FortnighT . The Co-operative Group  has been engulfed in a new scandal after it emerged  that one of its board has been suspended for allegedly lying about his qualifications. Munir Malik, who is also a Labour councillor in South London, is being investigated over the claim, made when seeking election to the  Co-op board, that he was  a chartered accountant. Malik was suspended by  the Labour Party on Friday after it became aware  of the investigation. The probe into Malik by  Co-op board members was initiated after chief executive Euan Sutherland launched  a review of the group’s records. Sutherland himself quit last month after declaring the organisation  is ‘ungovernable’. The Co-op refused to comment beyond confirming the suspension and that an investigation was under way. Malik could not be reached directly, but it is understood he explained the inaccuracy by saying he had previously been a chartered accountant but had been struck off after being declared bankrupt. But a spokesman for the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said: ‘As far as our records show he is not and never has been a member. ‘Only members of the ICAEW are entitled to  call themselves a chartered accountant.’ Malik belongs to what one insider described as a closed group who have come to dominate the Co-op despite its democratic structure of elected boards. His wife, Kathryn Smith, was also on the board of the Co-op Group from 1997-2008 and on the board of the Co-op Bank from 2001-2009, where she worked with disgraced chairman Paul Flowers. Smith, who has been a Labour councillor in Bexley, like her husband, quit the Co-op to stand as the party’s parliamentary candidate in Gravesham. Just days before the 2010 Election, in which she was defeated, she was arrested for drink driving, having hit a roundabout late at night. She was suspended for bringing the party into disrepute. The fresh scandal is the latest to hit the bank since Paul Flowers was revealed to be buying drugs by a Mail on Sunday investigation . The Co-op has been  in the spotlight since  its banking division plunged into losses last year and Methodist Minister Flowers was filmed by  The Mail on Sunday buying class A drugs. Former City Minister Lord Myners was appointed to assess the Co-op Group’s system of elections and appointments. He resigned last week in the face of bitter resistance from board members but plans to complete his review. A separate review by Sir Chris Kelly, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life – an advisory Government body – is looking into how the Co-op Bank came close to collapse last year. His report is expected after Easter. Last week the bank announced a £1.3 billion loss for 2013 and launched an emergency plan to raise £400 million to plug a hole in its finances. The Co-op Group, which now owns just 30 per cent of the bank, will unveil its own results next week and a loss of more than £2 billion is expected.","Munir Malik, who is also a Labour Councillor in South London, is being investigated over the claim .

Football fans observed a minute's silence at grounds up and down the country today as a mark of respect for the victims of the Hillsborough disaster, which took place 25 years ago today. Ninety-six Liverpool FC fans were crushed to death on April 15 1989 when dangerous numbers of supporters were allowed to crowd into Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium before the start of a match between the side and Nottingham Forrest in that year's FA Cup semi-final. And today players and fans held the respectful silence at 3.06pm - the same time the Hillsborough game was abandoned to deal with the tragedy. Kick-offs took place after the end of the silence - seven minutes later than usual. Silence: Fans stand an a memorial image is screen at today's match between Crystal Palace and Aston Villa . Paying respects: Players from Sunderland and Everton observe the silence before their match begins . Memory: Hillsborough now has 96 white seats decorated with roses and messages for the victims . Red rose: The view of the Hillsborough pitch from the special seats in the Leppings Lane End . Time to remember: The clock at Hillsborough showing 3.06, the time the 1989 semi-final was halted . In the Hillsborough stadium itself, 96 red roses were attached to chairs, painted white, in the stand. Each rose had the name of a victim attached to it. The managers of Sheffield Wednesday and Blackburn Rovers - the two clubs meeting at Hillsborough today - then placed wreathes in front of the display, to applause from both sets of fans. This season's FA Cup semi-finals take . place at Wembley on the anniversary weekend, and the national stadium . has also left 96 seats opposite the players' tunnel empty and draped . with Liverpool scarves.

Ahead of the traditional Saturday starts, fans began to unfurl homemade banners . paying tribute to the 96 victims, while clubs displayed messages of . support on the big screens around the grounds. In the aftermath of the 1989 disaster, police attempted to shift the blame to the Liverpool fans. Erroneous reports quickly emerged claiming that fans had disrupted rescue efforts and desecrated the bodies of the dead. An inquest in 1991 ruled that all the deaths were accidental. A decision by the coroner that all deaths had taken place by 3.15pm on the day meant that many potential sources of evidence were not called forward, and the question of whether more fans could have been saved was left unasked. However, after a lengthy campaign by families of the victims, an independent report was commissioned, which revealed that police had doctored statements made in the wake of the tragedy. The revelations contained in the document led to a fresh Hillsborough inquest, which is currently being heard. On the first day of hearings, the judge conducting the inquest said it is 'seared into the memories of the very many people affected by it, most notably of course the families of the 96 people who died.' 25 years on: 96 Liverpool scarves are laid at Wembley ahead of the FA Cup semi-finals .

Large crowds had built up outside the turnstiles. 2.44pm: Fans were asked to stop pushing, though crowding was already bad and the turnstiles were struggling to cope. 2.47pm to 2.57pm: Some external gates were opened to relived pressure on the turnstiles - which caused fans to rush forward and crowd the pens even more. Pressure built up, and narrow gates in two of the pens were opened. Officers though fans were deliberately invading the pitch. 3pm: Kick-off.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Attempts to reintroduce dormice where they had become extinct have failed – because the creatures are too dozy. The species, once widespread in Britain, declined in the 1950s due to loss of hedgerows and  by the 1990s had become extinct in seven counties. In an attempt to restore numbers, more than 700 dormice were released at 19 woodland sites from North Yorkshire to Suffolk by the People’s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES). Doormice began to become extinct in the 1950s because of a loss in hedgerows . But a review of the 21-year-old, £13,000-a-year project for government wildlife advisers Natural England found it was ‘not an unqualified success’. Ian White, an ecologist for the PTES, said that at five of the sites dormice are probably extinct, at four the species may be extinct and at ten it is too soon to say. There were only two sites where the dormice had moved out of the woodland and nested  in the neighbouring countryside – a key sign of success. One problem is the common or hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) likes to snooze. Even when they become active at night they do not venture too far from home. Mr White said:  ‘I wouldn’t call them lazy exactly, it’s their lifestyle. They don’t go in for too much activity.’ Other factors blamed were mild winters and predators. Mr White said: ‘Between 50 to 70 per cent of dormice die in hibernation. They are happy in snow but in mild weather they wake up and use up energy from their stores of fat. Dormice are also eaten by squirrels and will be taken by cats and owls.’ The species was once widespread in the UK. Now, an attempt to re-introduce the animals has been introduced in 19 counties .","Attempt to reintroduce creatures in 19 sites from Yorkshire to Suffolk .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A woman has been seriously injured after two diggers fell off the back of a lorry on a dual carriageway, smashing into a car. The lorry was carrying the the two vehicles down the A194 in South Tyneside this morning. It is thought that the diggers clipped a railway bridge as they passed underneath, knocking them off of the lorry and on to the road. Crash scene: One of the two diggers was seen lying across the A194 this morning after it fell off the back of a lorry . Clipped: The diggers are thought to have fallen from the lorry after clipping the railway bridge seen in the background . Casualty: A woman was taken to hospital after her car was hit by a digger . Police, paramedics and the fire service were dispatched to the scene at around 11am today. The woman was taken to hospital in an ambulance while police officers set about investigating the scene. One of the diggers could be seen resting upside-down on the carriageway with its arm extended. Injury: One of the diggers hit a car, which can be seen in the background, leaving one woman with serious injuries . Damage: Bricks are missing from a pillar past which the lorry would have travelled . Response: Investigators, who closed the road for a time, can be seen inspecting the fallen vehicles . The damaged car could be seen feet away from the upturned digger, where it had come to a stop the other side of a crash barrier, having lost its roof. In the wake of the accident the road was closed in both directions, though one lane has now re-opened. A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: 'One woman appears to be seriously injured and has been taken to hospital.

"By . Nick Constable . Delayed inquiry: Ben Cowburn, 18, killed himself in 2010 after falling out with the TV comedian . A gay celebrity who is alleged to have groomed a teenager before he killed himself has contacted the youth’s grieving family to ‘explain’ their relationship. But last night the parents of Ben Cowburn spoke of their dismay at the TV comedian’s use of high-profile libel lawyers Carter-Ruck to make the approach. The Cowburns have so far refused to respond, insisting the celebrity – known only as Mr X after a coroner controversially protected his identity – should first be questioned by the Metropolitan Police. They have sent a formal request to detectives asking that he be interviewed about Ben’s disclosure of homosexual rape and other sex assaults. Ben was 18 when he was found dead in his bedroom at a psychiatric unit in 2010 after telling medical staff he had been raped by the celebrity. ‘The letter from this man’s lawyer asks whether we would accept a letter giving his personal explanation,’ said Ben’s mother Sharon, 52. ‘It’s a sounding-out letter offered in a cautious manner. We would welcome an explanation and are considering this approach. But we are not used to dealing with media lawyers. ‘It makes things even harder for us. We are still grieving for Ben. The police never questioned this man and we think they now should, perhaps before any letter is sent. There remain many unanswered questions.’ Dismay: Last night his parents, Sharon and Steve Cowburn, spoke of their dismay at the TV comedian's use of high-profile libel lawyers Carter-Ruck to make the approach. Above, the grieving parents arrive at Ben's inquest . Her husband Steve, 51, added: ‘What I don’t want is for Mr X to send us a letter full of platitudes – we took him to a few parties, he had a good time, it was all fine – that kind of thing. ‘I’ve emailed the investigating officer to ask why he never interviewed Mr X, given he’d seen words like sexual abuse, cocaine and rape used by witnesses. Revealed: How Tthe Mail on Sunday broke the story . At the inquest the experts agreed Ben was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder linked to a single event or events in London.’ Before his death at Longreach House mental health unit in Cornwall, Ben named Mr X and told nurses how he had been raped and sexually assaulted during drug-fuelled parties involving group sex. The celebrity’s attempt to contact the family follows a series of Mail on Sunday exclusive stories questioning the authorities’ response to Ben’s death. We revealed how Cornwall Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon declined to call key witnesses – including the nurse in whom Ben confided about being raped – and how she concealed Mr X’s identity through an informal agreement with lawyers. The Cowburns, from Truro, want Chief Coroner Peter Thornton QC to review her handling of the inquest and explain why it took more than three years to arrange. They are also pressing for an inquiry into care standards at Longreach after three families contacted them about the deaths of their own children there. Mrs Cowburn says one case is ‘shockingly similar’ to her son’s and believes that ‘people are dying in there’. She and her husband have passed a dossier of complaints to their MP, Conservative Sarah Newton. Last month a jury returned an open verdict at the end of an eight-day inquest into Ben’s death, a result indicating insufficient evidence surrounding his death. The court heard how he was ‘groomed’ by Mr X after moving to study in London in September 2009. He was then aged 17. In July 2010 the comedian and Ben fell out and the teenager’s mental health deteriorated. He made a series of apparent suicide attempts and was admitted to Longreach where he said the celebrity gave him expensive gifts and cocaine and left him feeling ‘dirty and used’. On one occasion he said the older man climbed uninvited into his bed, engaging him in a sex act. However, Metropolitan Police Det Con David Gadsby told the inquest there was ‘no conclusive evidence’ that Ben was raped.","Comedian has contacted Ben Cowburn's family to 'explain' relationship .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Patients will be able to see their family doctors in the evenings and at weekends under radical new plans to transform surgery opening hours and improve patient care. The Prime Minister is poised to unveil £50 million of funding making the money available to GPs so they can open their doors seven days a week. GPs in 1,000 practices in England will receive extra funding to reorganise their services to enable surgeries to open from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week. The Challenge Fund, which will be launched tomorrow, is expected to include provisions for GPs to carry out patient consultations via video-link, secure email and telephone. The Prime Minister is poised to unveil £50 million in funding for GPs across England, to allow them to open their doors in evenings and at weekends . Health Minister Norman Lamb, told The . Telegraph it is vital that doctors embrace new technology to help improve services for patients. He said: 'It’s . very difficult for people with busy lives to get appointments with GPs . so let’s just get smarter with the use of technology. 'In . every other aspect of our lives we are using technology to communicate. We have got to get into this in a big way in health and care. 'It . has transformed the efficiency of many other industries and sectors and . I think it can do the same and provide more responsive care for busy . people.' He said for those patients with something they just need 'checking out' taking time off work to try and get an appointment can become a 'nightmare'. Instead, Mr Lamb said GPs should have the ability to email their patients to offer a quick response, saving the need for the patient to take up a clinic slot. It is hoped the moves will free up doctors to spend more time with elderly patients, who often have complex conditions, which require longer than the standard 10 minutes allotted to each appointment. Ministers believe the reform will end the inconvenience millions of workers face trying to book an appointment with a doctor. And it is hoped GPs will have longer to spend with frail and elderly patients. The Challenge Fund, which will be launched tomorrow, will provide extra money to allow GPs to reorganise their servicesto enable practices to open from 8am to 8pm seven days a week. The reform package is also expected to include measures for GPs to email patients, who have concerns over minor ailments . Those over the age of 75 will be allocated a named doctor, who will take charge of their treatment. More elderly patients will be treated in the comfort of their own homes. Some will be given iPads and other devices to send information and data to their doctors, to help continually monitor their condition. Under the plans it is expected that groups of GPs practices will join together to form networks, to share the workload of covering clinics at evenings and weekends. 'In . every other aspect of our lives we are using technology to communicate. We have got to get into this in a big way in health and care' - Health Minister Norman Lamb . The reform is vital as a means of easing the burden on hospital A&E departments across the country buckling under the pressure of millions of patients walking through their doors. In recent years patients have swamped emergency units, not knowing where else to turn when surgeries close. inadequate out-of-hours health services have knocked patient confidence in the system, resulting in people with minor ailments flooding to accident and emergency departments. Four million more patients visited A&E last year, compared with a decade ago. NHS figures show millions of patients wait a week or more for an appointment with their GPs. Health ministers said they want to . restore the 'best traditions of family doctors', to boost services for . patients, particularly the elderly. Prime . Minister David Cameron first revealed the Government's plans to extend . surgery opening hours at last October's Conservative Party conference. New services will be offered to all patients over the age of 75, with the reforms dictating each patient that falls into that category must have a named doctor co-coordinating their care . He said: 'Millions of people find it hard to get an appointment to see their GP at a time that fits in with their work and family life. 'We want to support GPs, to modernise their services so they can see patients from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week. 'We also want greater flexibility, so people can speak to their family doctor on the phone, send them an email or even speak to them on Skype,' he added. Changes to GPs contracts, which came into effect this month, now dictate that all patients over the age of 75 will have a named doctor responsible for their care. The elderly people's charity Age UK welcomed the reform. Caroline Abrahams from the charity said the measures represent an 'important and very welcome step' towards better care for older people. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, Chair of the British Medical Association's General Practitioner Committee, urged caution, warning inadequate funding could undermine lasting change.","Prime Minister will announce new reform to transform patient care .

"By . Sam Creighton . Labour leader Ed Miliband played football with children at the Khan al-Ahmer Bedouin camp. Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander, left, also took part in the kickabout . Ed Miliband took a break from his busy schedule on the final day of his Israeli tour to showcase his footballing prowess. The Labour leader, a Leeds United fan, took part in the kickabout with local children on a visit to the Khan al-Ahmar Bedouin community in the West Bank. Other member of the touring party, including Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander, took part in the game before Mr Miliband met with the community's leader Abu Khamis. He used the opportunity to condemn the expansion of Israeli settlements in the region, claiming they were 'wrong and illegal' and posed a 'mortal threat' to any hope of a two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. While Mr Miliband reaffirmed his support for a 'homeland for the Jewish people', he made it clear this did not translate into an unwavering backing for the actions of the Israeli government. The 2,300 Palestinians living in the Khan al-Ahmar camp face forced displacement if Israeli settlements go ahead. The Labour leader said: 'What I have seen today shows that the expansion of Israeli settlements on the Palestinian West Bank is not only wrong and illegal but represents a mortal threat to the two-state solution and to a successful outcome of the peace process. 'If we are going to have a viable, democratic Palestinian state the more we see an expansion of settlements the more it becomes difficult to construct this state.' After the football match, Mr Miliband met the community's leaders and took the opportunity to condemn the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank . The Labour leader said that while he supports the existence of a 'homeland for the Jewish people', this does not translate to blanket support for the Israeli administration and its policies . This was the last day of Mr Miliband's three-day tour of Israel with his wife Justine, centre, and several key Labour Party figures . Tonight will be the last evening of the tour and Mr Miliband will spend it in Ramallah, in central West Bank. He is the first leading British politician to spend a night in the area, as security concerns have previously made it impossible.

"By . Adam Lee Potter . It could not have been a more perfect engagement gift from a proud groom to his blue-blooded, dog-loving wife-to-be. When writer William Cash presented society milliner Lady Laura Cathcart with an impossibly cute £800 pug, she was just as thrilled  as he knew she would be. That, however, was when things began to go horribly wrong. Lady Laura with pug Thimble, who was bought in a panic as a replacement for a lost pug . Cash, a friend of actress Elizabeth Hurley, was left panic-stricken when he lost the pug – a rare 14-week-old bitch called Damson – in a storm a fortnight before the wedding. Lady Laura, 29, whose father is  the 7th Earl of a pug-obsessed clan that dates back to the 12th Century, was on her hen night in Essex, leaving her fiance to look after Damson and their four-year-old labrador, Cressetta. But while Cash worked upstairs at the couple’s moated Elizabethan manor – Upton Cressett Hall in Shropshire – the kitchen door, warped by the February floods, blew off, and the two dogs fled. ‘I panicked because Laura was  due home about four hours later,’ admits William, the son of Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash. After broadcasting an SOS over the airwaves of Radio Shropshire, he also enlisted the help of his neighbour, Lucy Birley, former wife of pop  star Bryan Ferry. Her two lurchers hunted in vain for the runaways. ‘The labrador eventually came home with her tail between her legs,’ says William. Damson, the first little pug, who William tried to replace with new pug Thimble . ‘But we never saw Damson again. I all but drained the moat but to no avail. A fox or a hawk must have got her. In the middle of it all, Laura rang me to say, “I’ll be back by 7pm at the latest. I can’t wait to see my pug.” ’ William, . 47, has previously been married to jewellery heiress Ilaria Bulgari and . Mick Jagger’s ex-lover Vanessa Neumann – and he feared that losing . Damson could cost him  a third wife. So he did what any serial groom . would do: he lied. In an episode that could have been plucked from the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents or the Coen brothers’ hit Inside Llewyn Davis, William quickly tracked down a lookalike pug for £1,000 on the internet and set off in his Jeep on a  75-minute drive to a housing estate in Kingstanding, Birmingham. ‘I was so terrified I even rang up a minicab company to give me an escort,’ he says. ‘We ended up at 4pm in this rough-looking cul-de-sac which was guarded by a big beefy gent covered in tattoos. And there was me – £1,000 in fifties stuffed into the pockets of my Barbour. Upton Cressett Hall and Gatehouse (and surrounding fields), the home of William Cash and his wife, pug mad Lady Laura . ‘I thought, “This is it, only an idiot would fall for this scam. I’m not going to make it to the altar – they’re going to find me in the back garden of some nasty terrace, bonked on the head.” ’ William need not have worried. Fifteen minutes later, he was the proud owner of Thimble, a six-week-old Kennel Club-registered pug. ‘I raced home and got there with minutes to spare. When Laura arrived, the first thing she said was, “I want to give my pug a big hug.” Silently, I handed her over, fearing the worst but hoping for the best. Laura Cathcart and william Cash on their wedding day . ‘I tried to brazen it out but Laura wasn’t having it. She said straight away, “She’s lost a lot of weight, have you not been feeding her? Why has she got a white chest? And why is she so much more black? Is this really my pug? Have you killed my pug?” 'For Laura, pugs come first. Pugs, hats and then – hopefully – me. I had to come clean. ‘She was very upset but, thankfully, she and Thimble fell totally in love. Laura did realise that I was at least, two weeks before the wedding, trying to make her happy. ‘And I think she was secretly impressed that I had managed to track down a replacement so quickly – black pug bitches are notoriously rare. The first one took us four months to find.’ William is, however, back on probation after another accident almost put paid to the second dog. ‘Thimble is 14 weeks old now – the same age as Damson when she disappeared – and she’s a very mischievous, feisty dog. I was walking her along Pimlico Road in London the other day when she darted off into traffic. 'I had to rugby-tackle her. One lost pug was bad enough – I couldn’t weather a second.’ William proposed to Laura at the church set in the grounds of his home last September. ‘It was all very romantic,’ he says. ‘Her favourite flowers are thistles so I lined  the font with them and hid the ring. Then we rang the bells.’ At their wedding last month, Hurley’s son Damian, 12, acted as pageboy. ‘I did think about telling the pug story in my groom’s speech,’ says William. ‘But then I looked up and saw all Laura’s family – all those pug-loving faces – and I bottled it.’","Calamity struck as MP's son lost £800 prize pug .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A Premier League footballer has been filmed inhaling potentially deadly laughing gas behind the wheel of his car, before allegedly driving 120 miles. West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino, 20, can be seen inhaling nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas or 'hippy crack', from a purple balloon while sitting in his Range Rover. It is thought the footage was taken in Birmingham city centre, just before Berahino reportedly drove 120 miles to London to carry on partying. Scroll down for video . West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino, 20, has been filmed inhaling a nitrous oxide balloon in his car before reportedly driving 120 miles to London in order to continue partying . In the short clips, Berahino can be seen breathing from the balloon while staring wild-eyed into the camera. A giggling girl asks him 'are you f*****?' before questioning whether he has 'had enough'. Berahino has today issued an apology for his behaviour and his club say he will be reprimanded for his actions . The drug is legal in the UK but several young people have died from taking it as it can cause asphyxiation, heart attacks and brain damage. The £12,000-a-week player was filmed taking the drug just hours after the team lost 3-0 to Manchester United. Berahino was partying at trendy Nuvo bar in Birmingham city centre on March 8 when the video was taken, according to the Sunday Mirror. In a statement, Berahino said: ‘This was very poor judgement on my part and not the right example to be setting. At the time, I wasn’t fully aware of the serious health risks involved but now I know, I won’t be doing it again.’ Richard Garlick, the club’s sporting and technical Director, added: ‘I have spoken to Saido about the incident and told him in no uncertain terms that his conduct is not befitting a West Bromwich Albion player. 'Saido knows he has made a mistake.

"By . Nick Harris . Police have been called in by the new owner of Leeds United, Massimo Cellino, after secret spy cameras were discovered at Elland Road. In a sensational twist to the convoluted takeover saga at Leeds, West Yorkshire Police have launched a theft investigation, which sources say relates to club funds used to install the cameras.

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Hundreds of thousands of Eastern European immigrants came into Britain uncounted because inspectors were at the wrong airports, officials admitted yesterday. A damning report reveals that 350,000 people arrived unnoticed because of glaring gaps in the survey relied on by the Office for National Statistics for migration estimates. Those counting migrants into the country went to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester during the crucial years of large-scale immigration from Eastern Europe, while only a handful attended other major airports such as Luton and Stansted, where hundreds of thousands of migrants were arriving. New figures reveal how from 2001 to 2011, in many years net migration had been underestimated . In addition, immigrants on many ferry routes were barely or never checked, tens of thousands of children were missed entirely and warning signs from other statistics were ignored, the report adds. The ONS confession comes almost 12 months after the discrepancies first emerged – and follows years of scepticism over the accuracy of its International Passenger Survey, which is based on interviews with people passing through air and sea ports. Last May the Daily Mail revealed that the 2011 census found nearly half a million more people in the country than the ONS had estimated and that the great majority were Eastern European immigrants. Yesterday’s report appealed for the millions of pounds spent on the immigration survey to be quadrupled to cope with the rate of arrivals. Other ONS surveys of the population in Britain suggested immigration was much higher than the IPS estimates. The rate at which National Insurance numbers were issued to new workers also indicated that immigration figures must be wrong. But between 2005 and 2008 nothing was done to put the survey right. The 2011 national census found there were 464,000 more people in the country than had been expected. The ONS said yesterday that most of the unchecked immigrants arrived in the four years after Poland and seven other Eastern European countries entered the EU in April 2004, when Britain was one of just three European countries to allow them in to take jobs. Failures in the survey meant that between 2001 and 2011, net migration – the population change after both immigration and emigration are counted – was underestimated by 346,000, equivalent to a city the size of Bradford. Nearly a quarter of a million went uncounted between 2005 and 2008 alone, when there were just a handful of clipboard survey staff at Luton and Stansted and none at all at Robin Hood airport near Doncaster. The Office for National Statistics said researchers focussed on large airports including Heathrow and Gatwick, but overlooked the number of immigrants arriving through smaller regional airports . These errors add to a decade of mismanagement of migration estimates and surveys. Before the labour market was opened to Eastern Europeans, Tony Blair’s government published projections which said the likely future level of Eastern European immigration would be 13,000 people a year. ‘The migrants were missed due to IPS interviewing being concentrated at the time at principal airports, such as London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Manchester,’ the report said. ‘During this time, many migrants from the EU8 countries were travelling on the increasing number of routes connecting their countries with the UK regional airports. ‘The number of routes connecting UK airports with airports in EU8 countries increased from 30 in 2001 to a peak of 190 in 2007. Many of these routes were not covered, or not fully covered, by the IPS for migration purposes prior to 2009.’ The report said the IPS has since been upgraded to cover regional airports. But it admitted the survey between 2004 and 2008 was ‘inadequate’ and improvements ‘came too late to capture much of the increased migration following 2004’. Yvette Cooper, who has been branded 'brass necked beyond belief' Yvette Cooper was branded ‘brass-necked beyond belief’ last night after complaining about the number of migrants in Britain. The shadow home secretary said she was ‘concerned’ about the level of ‘cheap migrant labour’ from Eastern European countries. Miss Cooper, who was a minister for more than a decade in the last Labour government, also claimed she did not want Britain to be ‘dependent’ on migrant workers. The speech appeared to suggest Labour is taking a more sceptical approach on immigration, which is consistently among voters’ top concerns. But Tory MPs demanded she apologise for Labour’s mistakes. James Clappison, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘It was her government that has prime responsibility for the number of Eastern European migrants in Britain because they failed to impose transitional controls … This is brass-necked beyond belief.’ MigrationWatch’s Sir Andrew Green said Miss Cooper’s speech hid ‘the absence of any real policy’ on cutting migrant numbers. Inspectors now interview up to 800,000 of the 200million thought to be entering or leaving the country every year. Improving accuracy by a useful margin would mean interviewing four times more passengers, raising the annual cost of the survey from £5million to £20million, the ONS said. Sir Andrew Green of campaign group MigrationWatch said: ‘This is final confirmation that net foreign migration under Labour totals nearly four million, two-thirds from outside the European Union. ‘It also shows that the peak of net migration was nearly 275,000 a year, making it even more difficult for the present government to get the numbers down to tens of thousands.’ David Cameron pledged to reduce net migration to 1990s levels of below 100,000 by the 2015 election. ‘Latest figures put net migration at 212,000 for the year up to last September. The figure is going up thanks to EU migration which the Government is not allowed to restrain,’ Sir Andrew added. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said yesterday: ‘What the latest ONS statistics underline is the point at which, in the 2000s, immigration was out of control.’ He added that despite the error Mr Cameron had confidence in the ONS.","Year after year official data played down scale of immigration .

Cardiff have reported their suspicions to the Premier League and Sportsmail can reveal that the allegations also include an assertion that Moody contacted at least three individuals at the club between Wednesday and Friday of last week, asking for information about the team. A prominent Cardiff source has told us that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was made aware of what was going on when a message sent from Moody’s phone, listing the starting 11 against Palace, was received by a Cardiff employee. The employee tipped off Solskjaer, who reported the matter to the club hierarchy, but the Norwegian did not change his team. Moody and Palace have strenuously denied they attempted to obtain team information from anyone at Cardiff. Cardiff have not complained formally to the  Premier League, but chairman Mehmet Dalman has handed over a dossier and requested the incident be reviewed. The dossier has been built around what the source calls ‘real evidence’, including the phone records of staff who would have had access to the information that was leaked, and text messages from Moody, who was sacked by owner Vincent Tan last year.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Confession: Thomas Kiely, 57, laundered £235,000 in seven years, while he and his wife Caroline Lewis (background) claimed £60,000 in benefits . A loan shark begged a judge not to send him to prison telling a court his rates were 'better than payday lender Wonga.com', after admitting laundering £235,000. Over the course of seven years Thomas Kiely netted the profits of his loan shark scheme while he and his wife Caroline Lewis claimed £60,000 in state benefits. When he was caught, the 57-year-old said he drew only an 'average wage' from the business, and was 'providing a service' to desperate people only payday lenders would touch. Manchester Crown Court heard Kiely’s dozens of customers paid between 50 and 100 per cent interest with ‘penalties’ for paying late. A handwritten loan book revealed a snapshot of how lucrative the scheme was - with £107,000 worth of repayments, outstanding debts and late payment fees racked up by 25 people over just seven months. But Nicola Gatto, defending, told the court: 'Within his community there are large numbers of people who, because of their debt history are very limited in terms of the places they can go, other than companies such as Wonga. 'Their rates are utterly exorbitant and far greater than the rates being charged by Mr Kiely.' The court heard Kiely came from an Irish travelling family who ‘kept their wealth in gold’ and that he sold inherited jewellery to fund his loans. The racket paid for luxurious family breaks in Thailand and Tenerife at a time when the couple were jobless. Investigators also found bundles of banknotes stashed in every room of their flat. Kiely was jailed for 26 months after admitting three counts of benefit fraud, illegal money lending and one charge of money laundering, between 2006 and last year. His 47-year-old wife, Caroline Lewis, was jailed for 10 months alongside him after admitting four counts of benefit fraud and one charge of money laundering, following an investigation by the Birmingham-based Illegal Money Lending Team. Jailed: Kiely (left) was sentenced to 26 months in prison after admitting benefit fraud, illegal money lending and money laundering. Lewis (right) was jailed for 10 months after admitting benefit fraud and money laundering . Shark: Kiely tried to hide his face as he arrived at Manchester Crown Court . The pair from Monsall, Manchester, laundered £235,000 in total. Judge David Hernandez said hardworking members of the public were entitled to revulsion at their crimes. Miss Gatto, defending former labourer Kiely, said limited schooling, a stammer and poor health, including injuries from a 2004 shooting, meant he ‘lived on his wits’. Mark Monaghan, defending Lewis, said: 'There are no Rolls Royces or Jaguars here. 'The Office of National Statistics has the average worker’s income before tax at £26,000. 'Over the years, this comes to about the same. 'I know the difference is that the average person on an average wage would have to pay tax - but these defendants lived very modestly, but periodically had a nice holiday.' Mr Monaghan claimed Kiely’s lowest rate worked out at 200 per cent APR over a three-month repayment period. He added: 'If you can find a payday lender like Wonga with an APR under four figures I will not quite eat my wig, but I will be impressed.' Defence: Nicola Gatto, defending Kiely, told the court: 'Within his community there are large numbers of people who, because of their debt history are very limited in terms of the places they can go, other than companies such as Wonga.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Teachers going through the menopause are being discriminated against and need more support such as cooler classrooms and regular rest breaks, a union says. Women are being forced out of teaching because senior staff are failing to support them at a ‘very difficult time’, according to the National Union of Teachers. It said yesterday that some heads unfairly targeted older women for disciplinary proceedings rather than addressing problems they might face, such as difficulties linked to the menopause and outdated training. Teachers going through the menopause are being discriminated against and need more support, including cooler classrooms and regular rest breaks, the National Union of Teachers has claimed . The union has claimed some heads unfairly target older women for disciplinary proceedings rather than addressing the problems they might face, such as difficulties associated with the menopause . High classroom temperatures, poor ventilation and inadequate toilet facilities made symptoms worse for them, it added. At their annual conference next week, NUT members will debate the issues and are expected to call for guidance for schools to be drawn up ‘urgently’. The resolution says they are ‘concerned that there is an increasing trend in schools of targeting teachers who are over 50 with a view to end their employment early’. It adds: ‘Menopausal women can experience . hot flushes, headaches, tiredness and sweating. High workplace . temperatures, poor ventilation, poor or non-existent rest or toilet . facilities, or a lack of access to cold drinking water at work can make . all of these symptoms worse.’ Other symptoms included temporary memory loss, not being able to finish a sentence and feelings of anxiety. They want schools to offer the women the option of part-time working or job shares and to consider how timetables and workloads affect those going through the menopause. Schools which fail to ‘make suitable adjustments’ could face strike action. The NUT said it had strong anecdotal evidence that women over 50 were more likely to be subjected to capability procedures – which examine a teacher’s competence – than younger colleagues. NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: ‘We often find that the approach in schools now is that if you’ve been doing it for a long time, you must be stale and not quite the ticket.’","NUT say senior staff fail are forcing older teachers out of the profession .

"By . Andrew Pierce . When Nigel Evans was first tipped off that a young man had accused him of rape he appeared relaxed, never believing the claim would be taken seriously . Like so many gay men of a certain vintage, it was only after the death of his mother that Nigel Evans had the courage to come out. The loss of Betty Evans five years ago was a shattering experience for the Tory MP. But even the grief he suffered then must pale in comparison with the distress he has endured since the Crown Prosecution Service decided to charge him with nine sex offences against seven men. Evans remained relaxed when a close friend tipped him off last May that a young man of 22 had made rape allegations against him to the police. He never thought for a second it would be taken seriously. Today Evans must know that, even though he’s been cleared by a jury, his reputation is in tatters. The 56-year-old was portrayed in court as a sad, lonely, middle-aged man with a penchant for sex with men half his age. His own assessment to his legal team was simply that ‘there’s no fool like an old fool’. While his Conservative Association in Ribble Valley has been steadfastly loyal, some fellow Tory MPs fear he might not have the stomach to go on after the next election. An intensely private man who hid his sexuality for decades, he has been humiliated by the graphic descriptions of his clumsy and often drunken attempts at seduction inside his small constituency cottage in Lancashire. Though he was a popular choice to become the Deputy Speaker of the Commons four years ago, he had to resign from the job to clear his name. Even if his successor Eleanor Laing, another Tory      MP, wanted to resign to give  him his job back, it’s not in her  gift to do so. It is a matter for  the Commons. He also faces potential financial ruin. The proceeds from the sale of the 80-year-old family greengrocer’s business, which were supposed to support his retirement, have gone on legal fees. Given his Welsh roots, it is perhaps surprising that Evans became a rising star of the Tory Party. Born in Swansea, he went to the local state school. As soon as his head could be seen above the counter, he began working in the greengrocer’s established by his grandfather in the 1930s. Evans likens it to the shop in the sitcom Open All Hours. Scroll down for video . Like so many gay men of a certain vintage, it was only after the death of his mother Betty Evans (pictured in London in 2003) that Mr Evans summoned the courage to come out . Mr Evans launched the ParliOut group for gay MPs . As a teenager he knew he was  gay but hid it, later stepping out with a girlfriend for the benefit of his God-fearing parents Albert  and Betty. At 17, he joined the Young Conservatives when Margaret Thatcher became Tory leader. ‘I always thought it was God’s little joke,’ he once said. ‘He made me born in Swansea and born a Tory.’ He also wryly commented: ‘It wasn’t so much “the only gay in the village” as “the only Tory in Swansea”.’ Evans went on to study politics at the city’s university, but remained troubled by his sexuality, agonising over whether to tell his mother once his father died of cancer. ‘There was just no right time. I just did not want to upset her. I didn’t know how she would take it,’ he recalled. 'There was just no right time. I just did not want to upset her. I didn’t know how she would take it' - Nigel Evans on never telling his mother Betty he is gay . Having fought and lost in two  safe Labour seats in the 1980s, he was selected to fight a by-election in Ribble Valley in 1991. Even though he lost, the local Tories stayed true to him and he won the seat in the general election the following year. When he became an MP, he made a calculated decision to opt for a life of celibacy. He was ambitious and, in a Conservative Party hostile to the gay community, he decided that pretending to be heterosexual was the best way to advance his career. He even voted in favour of a series of measures which were seen to be anti-gay, such as opposing an equal age of consent. But by 2000, the pressures of living a lie became unbearable and he started to ‘consummate’ the gay phase of his life. At the bar at Tory Party conferences, or in the Sport & Social Club in the Commons, he often drank too much surrounded by young male researchers and was known to have wandering hands. He often used to sit hand-in-hand on the Commons terrace with one of the men who gave evidence against him in court. There  was inevitably gossip about  the amount of time he spent with male researchers often half  his age. Speaker of the Commons John Bercow (left) called in police after claims were made by a second man. It was during Michael Howard's (right) reign as leader of the Tories that Mr Evans' shadow cabinet career came to an end. There was an insinuation during the court case he was sacked because of his conduct, it was untrue . After the election of Iain Duncan Smith as Tory leader in 2001, Evans was made shadow Welsh Secretary. He contrived to be absent from  the vote allowing civil partnerships, missed three votes on  gay adoption and in one vote opposed it. In 2003, Evans’s shadow Cabinet career ended with the election of Michael Howard as Tory leader. There was an insinuation during the court case from the prosecution that he was sacked because of his social conduct. It wasn’t true. Howard was shrinking the size of the shadow Cabinet, and the Wales portfolio was reduced in stature. Evans decided to return to the backbenches rather than carry on in a lesser role. 'I have never come across somebody who was so open and positive about their sexuality. I was impressed' - Nigel Evans speaking about his attraction to one of his alleged victims . In the years that followed, he became more settled in his  sexuality. Ironically, it was a man who had helped Evans come to terms with being gay who, in 2009, told Tory whips that the MP had sexually assaulted him. Evans readily admits he had wrongly assumed there was a mutual sexual attraction, but flatly  denies sexual assault, a claim the jury believed. Speaking during the trial of the attraction he felt towards the young man, Evans told the court: ‘I have never come across somebody who was so open and positive about their sexuality. I was impressed. ‘We would sit very closely together. We would hold hands. My experiences were somewhat more limited than his.’ After the allegations were made to the whips in 2009, no official action was taken, and a year later Evans was elected Deputy Speaker by his fellow MPs. By that point, his mother had  died and, having stopped his  late-night drinking sessions in Parliament, within months he had come out. The three years that followed were some of the happiest of his life. But everything changed when further claims were made against him by a second man last year, and the Commons Speaker John Bercow called in the police.","Nigel Evans came out as gay after the death of his mother Betty in 2009 .

You would expect Arsenal to play two defensive midfielders against Manchester City, but it was a surprise to see Jose Mourinho do it against Crystal Palace. He was without the suspended Ramires, and playing Nemanja Matic made sense because he is cup-tied for Wednesday’s Champions League game, but Tony Pulis will have been pleased to see Oscar and Willian on the bench.

'We weren’t really interested in Leo having a lot of participation in the game' were the words that will come back to haunt Martino after the 1-0 defeat. He had been asked why Messi saw so little of the ball in Atletico's win. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Messi stopped and searched at airport on way to Atletico clash . Down and out: Lionel Messi was subdued as Barcelona crashed out of the Champions League to Atletico . One dimensional: Messi was restricted to the right wing rather than the roaming role he is used to . Comparison: Goalkeeper Jose Pinto covered just slightly less ground than Messi at the Vicente Calderon . 'We really only wanted him to have one-on-one opportunities down the right-hand side,' said the coach effectively ripping up the Pep Guardiola blueprint that has made Messi Barca’s fulcrum over the last six years. The coach also underwhelmed when asked about the pattern of games against Atletico Madrid this season. In five matches Barca have scored twice and been unable to beat Diego Simeone’s team. 'I see no reason why the next match will be any different,' said Martino to the exasperation of most Barcelona supporters. That next game against Atletico will be Barca’s last match of the domestic season and one they will probably need to win to retain their title. Under fire: Barcelona boss Gerardo Martino was criticised for his deployment of Messi on Wednesday night . Over and out: Barcelona missed out on a place in the Champions League semi-finals to their Spanish rivals . Messi has failed to scored against Atletico in the five matches played and finished woefully from several opportunities in the Calderon on Wednesday night but the Argentine is the least of Barcelona’s problems. They need to rebuild in defensive and goalkeeping positions but are prevented from doing so by their year-long transfer ban. Supporters will now put the club under huge pressure to bring in a new coach or even call elections and vote in a new president. Only a win in next week’s Copa del Rey final will calm their supporters, but with Gerard Pique struggling for fitness and Victor Valdes definitely out their defensive frailties will mean they start the game as clear underdogs. For the first time since 2011, Messi . has gone four games without scoring; the more revealing statistic, . however, is the distance he covered on Wednesday night. There seem to be . only two possible reasons behind a perceived lack of effort - one is . that he was hampering an injury, the other is that he wants to keep as . much in reserve for Argentina’s World Cup campaign. Many . players have appeared to do the same in recent years: Brazil legend . Rivaldo had his worst season at Barca before excelling at the 2002 World . Cup; and Zinedine Zidane was player of the tournament in 2006 after a . relatively low-key finish to Real Madrid’s domestic season. Messi . has never quite replicated his Barcelona form on the international . stage. For a player who has it all for his club, an end-of-season rest . may an attempt to go for broke in Brazil.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ignored: Terry Burns, 44, who had previously had a double bypass, spent the night at Royal Preston Hospital in a chair . A heart patient was forced to spend the night in A&E sleeping in a chair after the hospital ran out of beds. Heart patient Terry Burns, 44, was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital, Lancashire, last Wednesday night for an ECG and blood tests. But when his family returned the following morning, they found him still in the same chair in the waiting room. Hospital staff have now apologised to Mr . Burns, who underwent a double heart bypass three years ago, saying there . was not a shortage of beds but that the hospital had been 'unusually . busy'. Although some tests were carried out, there was no bed for him by the time his sister Tina Burns-Moore left that evening. When . she returned in the morning she was horrified to find her brother . sitting in the same chair she had left him in, fully clothed and . unwashed. Ms Burns-Moore, 45, said: ‘We are really angry. He has come in for help because he hasn’t been well. ‘If . they couldn’t accommodate him, someone could have contacted us and we . could have taken him to sleep in his own bed, if things were that . desperate. ‘He didn’t really sleep [well] in the chair. It was chaos - there were people coming and going. ‘My . brother tells me there were a lot of people in the same position. 'There . was a lady on a trolley in a bay who was asked to get off the trolley . because they needed it. ‘I just think people need to know what is happening because it is a terrible state of affairs.’ Mr Burns, who lives in Bamber Bridge, Lancashire, was given a bed later that day and was able to get some rest while he and his family awaited the test results. Apology issued: Despite staff knowing he had undergone a double bypass three years ago, Mr Burns, from Bamber Bridge, was forced to spend the night sleeping in a chair in the waiting area at the hospital's A&E . Karen Partington, chief executive of Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘Firstly we would like to sincerely apologise for the delay in identifying a bed for Mr Burns. ‘Our priority is to always provide excellent care with compassion for our patients and we regret that in this instance that was not achieved. ‘We very much encourage any patients and families who have any queries about their care and treatment to contact the team that is looking after them or talk to our patient advice and liaison services. ‘We have already started an investigation into why this happened and will take action to ensure this does not happen in the future.’ A hospital spokesman added there was not a regular shortage of beds and Mr Burns was unfortunate to have been admitted during an unusually busy period.","Grandfather with heart condition forced to sleep in chair at A&E .

"By . Nicky Campbell . The first time a child says 'Mummy' or 'Daddy' is the most cherished moment for any parent. I remember my children saying it, or even better, attempting to say it. More wonderful still, perhaps, if that's possible, is the first time a child says 'my Mummy' or 'my Daddy'. My mother remembers that moment to this day. After having my sister, but then suffering a series of miscarriages, she and Dad adopted me a few days after I was born. Nicky Campbell and his birth sister Esther . They felt that at last their family was complete with me, and as Mum always said, it just seemed as if it was meant to be. Mum is no reader of runes or tea leaves, she's one of the most rational human beings I've ever met, but I know exactly what she means. It's the magic of adoption. So why don't more people do it? In my new series, Wanted: A Family Of My Own, we were able to go behind the scenes and expose some of the myths and preconceptions about adoption. In each of the four episodes we look at two adoptions and meet the adoptive parents and the children being adopted. For the first time, I got a real glimpse of what my parents must have felt all those years ago. The assessment process, which has been much publicised, is rigorous and rightly so, but the joy at the end result is matchless. My mum's 90 now and in rude health. When she adopted me, times were very different and adoption was of another age. Back then there were around 20,000 babies adopted every year in Britain who had mostly been given up at birth. From left to right: Frank Campbell, Sheila Campbell, Nicky Campbell and Fiona Campbell . Today it's around 4,000 children, only about 50 of whom are babies, because back then very young or unmarried mothers were driven to give their babies away by the attitudes of society and all too often the shame of the family. The children needing loving families today are usually older than in the past, and have been taken by the authorities from troubled families as youngsters. Many have a history of abuse or neglect, but some things will never change: children still need a family in 2014, just as they did in 1962. A loving, caring family just like mine. This new series is ground-breaking for ITV. It took more than two and a half years to make because of the process itself and the unique partnerships we had to form with eight local authorities. In the first episode we meet Dan and Ania. Like my mum, Ania went through the torment of miscarriages. Dan had two children from a previous marriage, but they were desperate to complete their family so they set off on the adoption road. I saw the raw emotion, the desperate yearning - when people want parenthood this much it's all they can think about. When we see their happiness as they finally manage to adopt their little boy ten months later, you know they're going to be the most amazing parents. I get exasperated with some of the thoughtless and occasionally downright ignorant terminology people use. Nicky says that his mother has kept all of the tapes of him presenting Wheel of Fortune . 'What was it like when you met your real mum?' they'll ask. But my adoptive mum is my real mum: she isn't my birth mum, but she is my real mum. Yes, I did all the birth-tracing malarkey and it was fascinating, bewitching and at times utterly bewildering. Although it led to me meeting so many of my relatives including my half-sister Esther, ultimately, after coming out of the other side of a very peculiar tunnel, my sense of belonging to my adoptive family felt even stronger. I wasn't being disloyal, I was just completing the jigsaw puzzle, and Mum and Dad gave me all their loving support. That's what mums and dads do, isn't it? The modern approach is very different though. Today there is no erasing of the past. Heritage is hugely respected now and that really is for the better because the more knowledge a child has of their beginnings, the less of a burning, life-consuming issue it will become in the future. Of course, it's never forced on a child or young person to trace their parents, but there are no secrets and contact is always an option if appropriate. A few years back I was lucky enough to be chosen for the brilliant BBC1 programme Who Do You Think You Are? The subject was my dad - my adoptive dad, my real dad. He died in 1996, hours after I had held his hand and kissed him goodbye. As fulfilling and intriguing as the journey into my brand new past and quest for my 'birth' families had been, and whatever maelstrom of feelings it all stirred up, finding out about Dad - his family history, his amazing war record, all the things that made the man who really made me - was so much more emotional than the search for my own biological roots had been. Love transcends biology. Belonging transcends beginnings. When I presented my very first radio show on a local station in Aberdeen back in 1982, Dad and Mum drove 150 miles to sit in their car outside and listen intently to every cheesy link to every appalling 80s record I played. Nicky Campbell as a Baby . I may be doing them a disservice, but I don't really think Spandau Ballet was entirely their cup of tea. Mum still has loads of copies of the Wheel Of Fortune game show I fronted in the late 80s on video cassette. Embarrassing doesn't cover it. I've had the most amazing mum and dad, and you could be a mummy or a daddy too. You can be over 40, gay or straight, single, divorced or cohabiting, already have children, live in rented accommodation, be unemployed, have a low income or a disability - and still adopt. While I was making this series I didn't meet any prospective parents who thought the process was unnecessarily drawn out or intrusive. No more so than a pregnancy anyway! Hopefully, Wanted: A Family Of My Own will show the many thousands of potential adopters out there (and boy are they needed) that the process is accessible, far easier than they thought and perhaps far more wonderful than they ever imagined. I hope, in fact I know, that some amazing potential parents will learn more about the modern reality. I believe they will see the process demystified, myths dispelled and then one day soon some beautiful little person will look up at them and say 'Mummy' or 'Daddy'. That is the true magic of adoption. Wanted: A Family Of My Own airs on 24 April at 9pm on ITV.","Nicky Campbell will host a new series that follows the journey of adoption .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . The Indian conjoined twins born with one body and two heads have died after battling to survive for a remarkable 20 days. The babies, born by C-section weighed 7lbs 7oz when they were born on March 13th. They were born with one body, two heads, two necks, . two spines and two separate oesophaguses and trachea. But they had only . one heart and stomach and one lung each. Tragic: The Indian conjoined twins born with one body and two heads have died after battling to survive for a remarkable 20 days . Conjoined: The twins were born with one body, two heads, two necks, two spines and two separate oesophaguses and trachea. But they had only one heart and stomach and one lung each . Tragically, their mother Urmila Sharma, 28, decided she could not bear to meet her babies at all before they died. The twins' father, Subhash, 32, said: ‘The news did not . come as a shock but we were still devastated. 'They were very special . babies. Even though doctors had told us that they had minimal chances of . survival, we hoped they’d live. 'I wanted to raise them and for our . daughter to have sisters but God had a different plan. The fact they . survived for 20 days was even a miracle.' Dr Shikha Malik, who delivered the babies in Sonipat, northern India, said at first that while one baby was sleeping, one was - remarkably - crying. After two days, the babies were . transferred to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital in . Delhi, and were under close observation in the neonatal intensive care . unit. Loss: Tragically, their mother Urmila Sharma, 28, decided she could not bear to meet her babies at all before they died. The twins' father, Subhash, 32, said: ¿The news did not come as a shock, but we were still devastated' But Dr Minu Bajpai, . paediatric surgeon in charge of the babies while they were at the . hospital, explained: ‘In the end the baby's heart was too weak. 'They suffered respiratory problems from the moment they arrived with us, and they just seemed to deteriorate as each day passed. In the end it was their heart that gave up and they died of heart failure.’ Mrs Sharma, who already has a three-year-old daughter Shalini, chose to not meet her babies while they were alive. Her husband said: 'I went to Delhi last week and brought my daughters’ bodies home on April 2. My wife is still trying to cope with the loss. Weak: Doctors treating the twins say they suffered respiratory problems and died of heart failure . 'She could not take them in her arms and cuddle them when they were alive. She had accepted their fate but being a mother, it’s still hard to accept their death. 'She’s very emotional and she’s crying inconsolably. She wanted her babies to live so much and now they’re gone she is very lost.’ He said that they’d both struggled to come to terms with their daughters’ extraordinary condition. ‘It was very painful for both my wife and I to see them battling with life. Now I feel they have been set free. I buried them myself, according to Hindu rituals, but my wife couldn’t face it.’ Now, the family will try and pick up the piece of the sadness of the last month. Dr Shikha Malik, who delivered the twins, said: 'Although we suspected they wouldn¿t survive because of their medical complexities, we were still hoping we could save them' He added: 'We can never forget our babies; they will always be in our hearts. But we hope that our next baby will be born normal. 'I will make sure that if my wife gets pregnant again, she gets proper medical assistance throughout the pregnancy so that we’re more prepared next time.' Dr Malik added: 'Although we suspected they wouldn’t survive because of their medical complexities, we were still hoping we could save them. I was shocked they had lasted longer than 24 hours never mind surviving for 20 days. I hope the parents can recover from this sadness and pick themselves up again.'","Twins were born by C-section in northern India weighing 7lb 7oz .

"By . Mark Duell . and Anna Hodgekiss . Crohn's disease: Elizabeth Rose, 25, from Kent, launched legal action at the High Court today . A Crohn's disease sufferer is challenging what she claims is an ‘unlawful’ decision to refuse her funding for her eggs to be frozen before she undergoes chemotherapy. The judicial review action brought by artist Elizabeth Rose, 25, from Margate, Kent, was ‘exceptionally urgent’, a judge at the High Court in Central London heard today. Her barrister told Mr Justice Jay that Miss Rose, who was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at the age of 14, faces ‘imminent’ bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy - treatment she fears will render her infertile. One theory is that Crohn's is caused by the immune system attacking healthy bacteria in the gut. So by giving the patient a new immune system - through a bone marrow transplant - it is hoped that the disease can be cured. To have a bone marrow transplant, stem cells are removed, high-dose chemotherapy is given to suppress the immune system - and stem cells are then returned. Clinicians at King's College Hospital in South- East London applied on her behalf for funding so her eggs could be frozen before treatment. But Jeremy Hyam, representing Miss Rose, said there was a ‘continuing refusal’ by Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to provide NHS-funded fertility preservation treatment, with the most recent refusal being on March 19. Miss Rose, who was present in court, launched the legal action in a bid to overturn the refusal and keep alive her hopes of one day having children. She believes she is the victim of a ‘postcode lottery’ as the treatment is available to single women in other parts of the country. Hearing: A judge at the High Court in London (pictured) was told today that a judicial review action brought by Miss Rose was 'exceptionally urgent' Miss Rose, a Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design fine art graduate, said she is determined that the rules should be changed ‘as this treatment is becoming more commonplace for Crohn's disease sufferers and I would not want any other woman to have to go through this ordeal’. In written argument before the judge, Mr Hyam submits that the refusal to fund the fertility preservation treatment, which would cost £4,050, is unlawful ‘because it was and continues to be defended on the basis of a policy which is unlawful and out of date’. He told the judge: ‘The expected consequence for her if the fertility preservation treatment is not provided is lifelong infertility and the inability to bear her own genetic child. Oocyte cryopreservation takes a few weeks to complete and therefore there is a short window of opportunity.’ Egg freezing is funded by the NHS if carried out for women having cancer treatment. After treatment, it costs £200 a year to pay for safe storage of the eggs. It's claimed the chances of getting a baby from a frozen egg are about 1 to 3 per cent for each egg. Also, only eight out of ten eggs survive the thawing process. Before extacting the eggs, fertility drugs are used to stimulate the ovaries to produce follicles (which contain the eggs). The developing follicles are monitored and when they are large enough, they are carefully emptied to collect the eggs that they have produced. They are collected while the patient is under sedation or general anaesthetic. To freeze the eggs, they are placed in storage in liquid nitrogen and the standard storage period for eggs is normally 10 years. Up to December 2012, only 20 babies had been born in the UK after treatment using patients’ own frozen eggs (although more have been born from donor eggs). The case is being contested by Thanet CCG, which submits that its refusal is lawful. It has said in a statement: ‘All Kent and Medway CCGs have agreed a policy on assisted reproductive techniques, including in relation to the freezing of eggs. ‘The policy all Kent and Medway CCGs have adopted, after extensive consultation and clinical advice, is that this particular procedure will not normally be funded by the NHS in Kent and Medway on the basis that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate effectiveness. ‘We are very sorry about the distress this may cause patients who are facing very difficult personal circumstances. ‘However, we must use our limited public money to fund services for our population as a whole and so are required to take difficult decisions on prioritising treatments.’ Merry Varney, from law firm Leigh Day, who is representing Miss Rose, said in a statement: ‘Whilst we and our client appreciate there are limited funds available, Nice (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) reviewed the clinical evidence and cost-effectiveness of this treatment and has recommended it should be offered. ‘Thanet CCG provide funding for fertility preservation for males and couples, also recommended by Nice on similar terms. It cannot be right to not fund this treatment for women like Lizzy.’ Crohn’s disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system. Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon). Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss and, in the long term, the inflammation can result in additional complications, such as narrowing of the colon. It isn’t fully understood what causes the condition but genes, a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role. There is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms. In up to 75 per cent of cases, surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of the digestive system. One theory is that Crohn's is caused by the immune system attacking healthy bacteria in the gut. So by giving the patient a new immune system - through a bone marrow transplant - it is hoped that the disease can be cured. To have a bone marrow transplant, stem cells are removed, high-dose chemotherapy is given to suppress the immune system - and stem cells are then returned. There are currently at least 115,000 people living with Crohn’s disease in the UK.Crohn's disease can affect people of all ages, including children. However, most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30.","'Exceptionally urgent' judicial review action from Elizabeth Rose, of Kent .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . This contraption looks like something the Borg would use during a painful assimilation operation. But despite its terrifying appearance, these strange goggles have been designed to help astronauts see better in space. And it doesn’t need complicated cyborg technology to work – all that’s required is eyewash solution, a pump and a willing test subject. Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst tests the space eyewash goggles at Nasa¿s Johnson Space Center in Houston . The goggles have been designed to clear flecks of dust and other particles from an astronaut’s vision while on board the International Space Station. In zero gravity, all manner of substances could be found floating around in the air, from dust to chilli flakes and even sweat. If something gets into an astronaut’s eye, it’s difficult to get it out because rinsing it under running water is impossible. We are the Borg: The contraption has been likened to something Star Trek's the Borg (pictured) would use during a painful assimilation operation . When firefighters want to extinguish a blaze, they often douse it with water. Astronauts on board the ISS, however, are experimenting with a form of water that does the opposite.  Instead of stopping fire, this water helps start it. 'We call it ‘""supercritical water,""' said Mike Hicks of the Glenn Research Center in Ohio. 'And it has some interesting properties.' Water becomes supercritical when it compressed to a pressure of 217 atmospheres and heated above 373°C. Above that so-called critical point, ordinary H2O transforms into something that is neither solid, liquid, nor gas.  It's more of a 'liquid-like gas.' 'When supercritical water is mixed with organic material, a chemical reaction takes place—oxidation,' said Hicks. 'It's a form of burning without flames.' The ISS doesn’t have running tap water, and if it did, the stream would float away in expanding bubbles of silvery liquid. To combat the problem, engineers have come up with the space eye-wash googles, seen here on Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst at Nasa Johnson Space Center in Houston. The goggles are connected to a specially-formulated solution that is pumped around the eyes. Although the contraption might look painful, Gerst said: ‘It does not feel weird, but on the contrary it is good to know that we have these items onboard. This medical refresher course is getting Gerst ready for his Blue Dot mission that begins 28 May. Gerst will be leaving for space with cosmonaut Maxim Suraev and Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman for a six-month expedition on the International Space Station. The geophysicist and volcanologist will become the third German to visit the ISS.","Goggles are connected to eyewash solution which is pumped around eyes .

"By . Sara Malm . A woman who lost both parents to cancer in the space of two years is running the London Marathon to help raise awareness and funds for research. Clair O’Hanlon, 28, was heartbroken when her mother mother Kathleen died of ovarian cancer in 2010, aged 56. Just 26 months later, the family was dealt another devastating blow when her father, Patrick, died from lymphoma. For a good cause: Clair O'Hanlon is running the London Marathon and raising money for World Cancer Research Fund . The mother-of-one from Colindale, London, was going to hospital for a small operation in summer 2012, but when her 65-year-old father arrived to accompany her, he was immediately taken to A&E. Now, Ms O'Hanlon is training for the . London Marathon, raising money for World Cancer Research Fund, which . funds scientific research and health information programmes to help . people reduce their risk of getting cancer. When . her mother passed away, Miss O’Hanlon, her siblings and her father were . devastated. She said: ‘When my mother died, half of my father did.’ Her . mother Kathleen, a Tesco shop assistant, had suffered from back pain . for 18 months, but doctors blamed pressure on the sciatic nerve. Tragedy: Clair's mother Kathleed died from ovarian cancer in 2010, aged just 56, and 26 months later, her father Patrick, 65, succumbed top lymphoma . In March 2010 she was finally sent to undergo a scan, which showed that she had ovarian cancer. The . tumour was removed the following month and doctors at University . College London Hospital were hopeful Kathleen would recover. However, 19 days later, she was rushed . back into hospital by her husband Patrick, Ms O'Hanlon's father, and . she died shortly afterwards. ‘It was incredibly difficult, because it all happened so quickly and I didn’t have any time to process it,' Ms O'Hanlon says. 'It was very shocking. I was in a very bad way after my mum died. I shut down and I didn’t feel like I knew who I was.' Strong family ties: Clair, pictured with her brother Kevin and her daughter celebrating St Patrick's Day, said 'half of her father died' when the family lost her mother Kathleen . Just . two years later, on the anniversary of her mother’s funeral, she had to . take her father into hospital when he was visiting her at her then home . in County Louth, Ireland. He . had gone to support her as she was due to go into hospital for a small . operation – but arrived looking so unwell that his daughter immediately . took him to accident and emergency. She said: ‘He came over to support me but I ended up taking him to hospital. The doctors were very worried and said if we had left it a few more hours he would have been gone. ‘It was all very shocking and I didn’t have time to process it, it was just so overwhelming.’ Her father, a builder, never left the hospital and passed away from lymphoma in July 2012. 'There are no words to describe how it feels to lose both parents to this disease,' said Ms O'Hanlon . Miss O’Hanlon, who has a nine-year-old daughter, said that the pain of losing both her parents made her want to help other people become aware about cancer. The mother-of-one said: ‘Having lost my mother to cancer, the last thing I ever expected was to lose my dad to it. ‘There are no words to describe how it feels to lose both parents to this disease. ‘Afterwards I was in a really bad way and I shut down. I didn’t know who I was and I wanted to run away from my life. ‘I missed them so much. But I realised I had to keep living because that’s what my parents would have wanted me to do if they were alive.’ Last October, on what would have been her father’s 66th birthday, the accounts manager decided to enter the London Marathon. Miss O’Hanlon, who has so far raised £1,200 for her first marathon, said: ‘I know so many people affected by different types of cancer, so I wanted to help an organisation that funds research into prevention. ‘Whenever I don’t want to train, I think of my mum and dad and they make me go the extra mile. ‘If I can raise awareness and help other people who are going through the same thing, it will all be worth.’ Paul Fretwell, Head of Fundraising at World Cancer Research Fund, said: ‘We are hugely grateful to Clair for her support. The London Marathon is a serious challenge and an excellent way of raising vital funds for cancer prevention and promoting awareness about the links between cancer and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity.’ Scientists say about a third of cancers could be prevented if people were to maintain a healthy body weight, eat a healthy diet and be physically active.

"By . Mark Prigg . Your mobile phone could reveal a lot about your income, and even predict which part of town you live in, it has been claimed. These new maps reveal that in the world's biggest cities, those in affluent areas are far more likely to own Apple's iPhone, while those in lower income areas almost always own an Android handset. The maps echo findings from app makers and advertisers, who say that iPhone owners download and spend far more on apps than Android owners. Click here to open the interactive map in a new window . Created by analysing tweets, the maps reveal where phone owners tweet from. They show that in New York, affluent iOS owners (shown in red) are in Manhattan, while the suburbs are dominated by lower cost Android handsets (green). According to analysis firm App Annie, app developers make twice as much money from iOS apps than Android apps for - despite sales of handsets being in Android's favour. Games continues to be the top category in both Google Play and the iTunes app store, accounting for 40 percent of all app downloads. According to the most recent figures, there have been 50 billion total downloads from the Apple App Store, still just ahead of Google Play’s recently touted 48 billion. In recent years android has been adopted by many low cost handset makers, and is hugely popular in pay as you go handsets. Apple, on the other hand, still charges a premium for its products - with even its 'cheaper' iPhone 5C being far more expensive than Android handsets. Research has also found that Android users are far less likely to download and use apps. Despite android having 80% of market share in some countries, app makers still say they make twice as much money from iPhone users than they do android users, with many Android users believed to simply use their handset as a 'dumb' phone, rather than take advantage of its capabilities. According to the most recent figures, there have been 50 billion total downloads from the Apple App Store, still just ahead of Google Play’s recently touted 48 billion. Flurry, a mobile firm, also claims its research shows that for advertisers, Android customer is worth a quarter as much as an iPhone user. The maps were created by MapBox and Gnip. 'Mobile Devices is a map that reveals the information about phone brands that is stored when people use an official Twitter App and is hidden in the metadata attached to each tweet,' MapBox said. Each brand of phone is a different color and can be independently toggled. 'The patterns of usage in each city often reflect economic stratification. 'For example iPhones, in red, are predominantly in wealthy sections of the city while Android phones, in green, have more coverage in poorer sections.' The firm analysed over 3bn tweets to create the map. San Francisco, where iPhone owners cluster in the city's most affluent areas, with the 'hipster' Mission district being almost solid red. 'This is a look at 3 billion tweets - every geotagged tweet since September 2011, mapped, showing facets of Twitter’s ecosystem and userbase in incredible new detail, revealing demographic, cultural, and social patterns down to city level detail, across the entire world,' they say. 'We were brought in by the data team at Gnip, who have awesome APIs and raw access to the Twitter firehose, and together Tom and data artist Eric Fischer used our open source tools to visualize the data and build interfaces that let you explore the stories of space, language, and access to technology.' Android sales dominated in 2013, with with the platform running on 79% (785 million) of the devices shipped in 2013, up from 68% in 2012. According to market research firm Canalys, just shy of 1 billion handsets (998 million) shipped in full year 2013, a 44% increase on 2012. Android’s dominance grew with the platform running on 79% (785 million) of the devices shipped in 2013, up from 68% in 2012. Conversely, Apple’s iOS share fell from 20% to 15%, despite shipments increasing to 154 million. Microsoft saw a percentage point share rise to 3% as shipments increased 90% in 2013 to 32.1 million, driven by Nokia’s Lumia devices, and putting it ahead of BlackBerry, at 19.8 million. Samsung also performed strongly in 2013 and strengthened its position as the world’s leading smart phone vendor. Its market share jumped from 30% in 2012 to 32% in 2013. With Apple in second place, Huawei edged past Lenovo to claim third place, albeit by fewer than 5 million units. Central London is awash with iPhones, while in the suburbs Android handsets become more popular . Los Angeles shows a similar pattern, with the affluent parts of the area such as Beverly Hills having a high concentration of iPhone owners, shown in red.

"By . Darren Boyle . A young mother died from a large abscess on her brain six weeks after being sent home by her GP with antibiotics to treat earache, an inquest has heard. Tragic Zoe Adams, 28, died last year after medics put her symptoms - including ear and head pain, and discharge from her left ear - down to a ‘relatively minor’ infection. But a coroner concluded that doctors couldn’t have done any more to save the ‘extremely unlucky’ mother-of-three, who collapsed and died in Wythenshawe Hospital on March 21 last year. Tragic mum Zoe Adams, 28, who died from a large abscess on her brain six weeks after her GP treated her for an ear infection. Doctors believe the infection spread from Zoe Adams' ear to her brain despite being treated by a course of antibiotics . The mother-of-three was seen by two further doctors who all agreed with the ear infection diagnosis because Zoe Adams did not show any symptoms alerting them to the killer brain bug . A top ear, nose and throat surgeon, Andrew Camilleri, who carried out an investigation for the hospital into Ms Adams' death, told the inquest that there was around a one-in-4,000 chance of an ear infection leading to a brain abscess. He said he was satisfied the hospital . had taken all the steps possible to treat Miss Adams and said by looking . at her, no-one would have suspected she had a brain abscess. The court heard from medics - two doctors who had seen Ms Adams in the weeks before her death and two nurses who had taken calls from her - who said Ms Adams’ symptoms were consistent with nothing more than an ear infection. A brain abscess is a rare and life-threatening condition caused when an infection travels from another part of the body to the brain. Only three people per million will contract the deadly bug each year. With early diagnosis, nine out of ten patients are expected to survive. Patients suffering a brain abscess often develop a headache which is so severe it is not helped by pain killers. The infection can often cause changes in a patient's mental state and brings a fever with temperatures in excess of 38c . A patient may also suffer seizures as the infection attacks the brain. A brain abscess can be caused by sinusitis and even a dental infection that attacks the brain. In . some cases, a brain abscess can be caused by a serious head injury . leading to a fractured skull allowing the infection to pass into the . brain tissue. Patients diagnosed with a brain abscess will be treated with anti-biotics, surgery and in some cases anti-fungals. The earlier a patient is treated, the less chance of long-term complications. Patients can suffer from seizures and epilepsy . Source: NHS Direct . In fact, the mother-of-three had developed a middle ear infection which had led to a large 4cm abscess developing on the left side of her brain. The hearing was told the tragedy began on February 12 last year after Miss Adams, from Rusholme, Manchester went to see her GP Dr Praful Patel complaining of pains in her ear. The doctor examined her ear including the bone structure but thought the symptoms pointed to an outer ear infection. He prescribed her with antibiotics and asked her to come back in three weeks if she did not get any better. On March 1 Miss Adams called a triage nurse working for the Out-of-Hours Go To Doc service saying her ear was 'very painful' and was 'nine out of ten' on the pain scale. She was referred to a doctor at an out-of-hours surgery based at Wythenshawe Hospital who thought it was an infection of the middle ear but prescribed antibiotics and advised her to come back in a few days if the pain persisted or became worse. On March 16, Miss Adams spoke to another out-of-hours nurse complaining of headache and earache and four days later she was admitted to hospital. The Manchester hearing was told after her admission, she did not display signs of illness, such as high temperature or changed mental state, that could have prompted doctors to send her for a brain scan that might have discovered the abscess. Although she was seen to be very distant the night before she died, that was put down to the pressures of coping with young children. She last seen alive going to the toilet at around 4am after being kept in hospital overnight. She died on the ward later that day. Coroner Nigel Meadows said Zoe Adams was 'incredibly unlucky' saying the lack of other symptoms gave doctors little chance of diagnosing a brain abscess because of her 'robust constitution' Recording a verdict of death by . natural causes, Coroner Nigel Meadows said the diagnosis of a . ""relatively minor"" ear infection by Dr Patel had been 'completely . appropriate'. Mr Meadows . said the out-of-hours service had taken a sensibly cautious approach to . Miss Adams' condition and he thought they could not have done anymore to . prevent her death. Mr . Meadows said Miss Adams did not display any normal signs of somebody . with a cerebral abscess and added: 'Zoe has just been extremely unlucky . to contract this infection and to have a robust constitution.'He . added: 'There was no evidence that her condition justified a CT scan. It would be unrealistic to expect that the hospital perform a CT scan on . everybody who has a ear infection. 'Even . if she was given a emergency CT scan the night she died then there is . also no evidence to suggest she would have been able to be saved. 'It . is a very unfortunate series of events. The vast majority of people who . have ear infections don't have a cerebral abscess. She has been . extremely unlucky to contract this infection.'He added: 'Zoe . has just been extremely unlucky to contract this infection and to have a . robust constitution [that meant doctors could not tell she had an . abscess].' Speaking . afterwards, Ms Adams’ mum, Michelle Holt, said she accepted the . verdict, adding: 'It’s been a very, very hard time. My daughter was like . me and had a very strong pain threshold.' Brain abcesses are incredibly rare in Britain with most neurosurgeons expecting to treat at most four patients a year. Friends of Zoe Adams took to Facebook to pay tribute to the tragic mum-of-three who died after contracting the rare brain condition .","Medics believed Zoe Adams was only suffering a 'relatively minor' ear infection .

"By . Mark Prigg . They are responsible for the formation of continents, and are still active - as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions show. However, researchers have never been able to work out why the Earth developed tectonic plates, but other planets did not. Now they have solved the mystery - and say the key is tiny minerals within rocks. Researchers say weak zones caused the Earth's mantle to crack, causing tectonic plates to form . Earth has a unique network of shifting plates embedded in its cold and rocky outermost layer, the lithosphere. The motion of these plates drives many Earth processes, including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, while also stabilizing the planet’s climate and enabling life. The division of the Earth’s surface into rigid plates, separated by linear zones of concentrated deformation, is a defining characteristic of our planet, and unique among known terrestrial bodies. New Yale-led research suggests how and when Earth came to develop one of its most distinct features — rigid tectonic plates — and why Venus, Earth’s twin-like neighbor, never has. 'We think it all comes down to the behavior of tiny grains of minerals within rocks,' said Yale geophysicist David Bercovici, lead author of research published online April 6 in the journal Nature. Earth has a unique network of shifting plates embedded in its cold and rocky outermost layer, the lithosphere. The motion of these plates drives many Earth processes, including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, while also stabilizing the planet’s climate and enabling life. Despite evidence that Earth’s solid surface was already in motion more than 4 billion years ago, global plate tectonics — replete with rigid plates and a variety of plate boundary types — appears not to have developed for a billion years more. And it never has on Venus, although the planet is so similar to Earth in size, composition, and gravity that it’s sometimes called 'Earth’s twin sister.' Bercovici and co-author Yanick Ricard of the Université de Lyon in France argue that in Earth’s early days, mantle convection caused weak zones in the lithosphere. These zones persisted, developed into plate boundaries, and ultimately connected to form a global network of tectonic plates. The weak zones, they argue, resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms. The weak zones, they argue, resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms. 'If the rock gets weaker where it deforms, then deformation focuses there, making the grains shrink faster, in turn making the rock weaker,' Bercovici said. 'The weak zone narrows and intensifies until you get a distinct boundary. These are the plate boundaries.' This process does not happen on Venus, which has no plate visage, because its extremely high surface temperatures cause the grains to grow and weak zones to heal, he said. To illustrate their hypothesis, the scientists developed a theoretical model that explains how rock grains control the strength and weakness in the lithosphere. 'The model uses physics at the 1-millimeter rock grain scale to explain how the whole planet behaves, and how plate tectonics emerged on Earth, but not on her twin,' he said.","Weak zones in the earth's surface led to the eventaul creation of giant tectonic plates .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Twitter, YouTube and Facebook have made astronauts into overnight social media stars. It’s about time then, that Nasa’s ISS crew added Instagram to its social media weaponry. That's exactly what American astronaut Steven Swanson did on Monday after he became the first ever person to post on Instagram from space. American astronaut Steven Swanson has become the first ever person to post on Instagram from space after he posted this picture of himself floating on board the ISS' cupola . And, of course, Swanson’s image was a selfie. The photo, posted on the official Instagram account of the International Space Station, shows Stevenson floating in the ISS' cupola. The cupola is a panoramic control tower with several windows that reveal incredible views of the galaxy. It’s also home to sophisticated camera equipment capable of taking stunning images of Earth. The image instantly became a hit after it was posted on the official Instagram account of the ISS . In line with the latest Instagram trend, Stevenson posted the image without any filters with a caption that reads ‘back on ISS, life is good.’ The ISS has largely been shielded from politics on Earth, after Nasa said last week that it was severing ties with Russia except for on the International Space Station. Since the retirement of the space shuttle, Nasa has depended on Russia to hitch rides to the giant orbiting outpost. A Russian rocket last week delivered three astronauts, including Swanson. Swanson will assume command of Expedition 40 in May after Expedition 39 returns home. He is scheduled to return to Earth with in September. The rise of social media on the International Space Station started in May 2009, when Nasa astronaut Mike Massimino, or @Astro_Mike, sent the first tweet from space. He wrote the tweet and emailed it to the Johnson Space Center, which then posted the message to his account. In January 2010, Astronaut TJ Creamer was able to post the First Real-Time tweet from space. His message read 'Hello Twitterverse! We r now LIVE tweeting from the International Space Station -- the 1st live tweet from Space! :) More soon, send your ?s' In October 22, 2010 the first Foursquare check-in was made from space when astronaut Douglas H. Wheelock (@Astro_Wheels) checked in boarding the ISS and tweeted the following: I just unlocked the 'Nasa Explorer"" badge on @foursquare!'","Image posted by Steven Swanson who recently arrived on board the ISS .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Unhealthy modern lifestyles aren’t the only cause of heart disease, say scientists, who have found clogged arteries in Egyptian mummies. Scans of 4,000-year-old mummies have revealed evidence of hardening of the arteries – a condition which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Earlier studies had revealed fatty arteries in a large number of Egyptian mummies but critics had dismissed the find as related to their luxurious, fatty diets. Scroll down for video... Scans of 4,000-year-old mummies have revealed evidence of hardening of the arteries - a condition which can lead to heart attacks and strokes . Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of heart attacks and strokes caused by lack of blood to the brain. Until now it had been widely assumed that today's high rates of heart and artery disease were chiefly the result of unhealthy modern lifestyles. It is though that diets rich in saturated fat encourage the deposit of fatty layers on artery walls which harden over time. As a result blood vessels become narrower and the flow of blood is impeded. When insufficient blood reaches the heart muscle or brain it can trigger a heart attack or stroke. ‘Atherosclerosis is supposed to be a disease of modern civilisation,’ Dr Adel Allam, a nuclear cardiologist at Cairo’s Al Azhar University told Alan Mozes of Health Day. ‘It's supposed to be explained by the fact that we're eating all the wrong foods, not exercising enough, becoming obese and having diabetes. ‘And a lot of people have said that if we could just go back to the way our ancestors were living we could even lose this problem,’ he added. In a previous study, scientists looked for evidence of heart disease by taking an X-ray of the mummified remains of Esankh who lived in the third Intermediate period (1070-712 BC) An Egyptian princess who lived more than 3,500 years ago is the oldest known person to have had clogged arteries, dispelling the myth that heart disease is a product of modern society. Dr Allam and colleagues made the discovery in 2011 when they found the Egyptian princess Ahmose-Meryet-Amon, who lived in Thebes  between 1540 and 1550 B.C., had calcium deposits in two main coronary arteries. The princess' father and brother were both pharaohs. The mummy had pierced ears and a large incision in her left side made by embalmers to remove her internal organs. Dr Allam doubted she would have received much treatment beyond maybe taking special herbs or honey. 'If she were my patient today, she would get open heart surgery,' he said. He added the princess' clogged arteries looked remarkably similar to heart disease in contemporary Egyptians. Dr Allam and his colleagues presented their findings at the recently concluded American College of Cardiology annual meeting, in Washington. The group had previously found identified hardening of the arteries in 16 mummies at the Egyptian National Museum of Antiquities in Cairo. Of these, nine showed evidence of atherosclerosis - build-up of fatty materials such as cholesterol, in blood vessels. But the group decided to expand their initial study to include naturally mummified specimens from other societies and economic backgrounds. Samples were gathered from Lima, Peru; from the Aleutian people in Alaska; from Native Americans in Nevada; and from people in Mongolia. Dr Allam said he wanted to respond to any criticism that mummies of Egypt only represented a rich elite, who would have eaten more fatty foods. The scientists scanned 76 mummies from around the world and arterial disease was found in around 38 per cent of them, with the average age of death estimated at 37. The team also scanned 178 Cairo cancer patients, aged from 14 to 48, and found that 61 per cent of them had arterial hardening. ‘There was no difference between the mummies and patients in terms of atherosclerosis incidence or severity,’ Dr Allam said. ‘They were nearly equivalent’. Dr Allam added that heart disease risk is not just about poor diet and obesity, but that genetics may also come into play. A second CT reconstruction from an earlier study shows a mummy from 200-900 AD of a Peruvian woman in her 40s, excavated from Huallamarca, near Lima, with calcifications in the arteries . Last year, CT scans of 137 mummies showed evidence of atherosclerosis, or hardened arteries, in one third of those examined - including those from ancient people believed to have healthy lifestyles. 'Heart disease has been stalking mankind for over 4,000 years all over the globe,' said Dr Randall Thompson, a cardiologist at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City and the 2013 paper's lead author. Dr Thompson said he was surprised to see hardened arteries even in people like the ancient Aleutians who were presumed to have a healthy lifestyle as hunter-gatherers. 'I think it's fair to say people should feel less guilty about getting heart disease in modern times,' he said. 'We may have oversold the idea that a healthy lifestyle can completely eliminate your risk.","Study suggests heart disease risk is not just about poor diet and obesity .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A high-tech centre in Scotland is giving specialist prosthetic treatment to military amputees. The app-controlled Touch Bionics hand is pictured . Gone are the days of solid rubber prosthetics. From 3D-printed limbs to titanium legs and hands controlled by apps, advances in technology are revolutionising the industry. Now, a new state-of-the-art centre has opened in Scotland to give specialist treatment to military amputees - taking advantage of these developments, and making the technology more mainstream. The service is based at the WestMARC unit at Southern General Hospital, and at the SMART Centre in Edinburgh. Patients in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee will be able to access services via video link-up. The units will run alongside the existing NHS prosthetics service, and use specialist prosthetic training and imaging equipment to manufacture new socket technology. The centre also features a gait laboratory that will study how well patients are walking with their new limbs. ‘Military veterans who have lost limbs in conflict have specific and complex needs due to the nature of their injuries,’ said Health Secretary Alex Neil. ‘That is why we were determined to set up a state-of-the art service employing some of the best new technologies.’ Among the amputees is Ian Robin, 53, whose prosthetic hand, called i-Limb and built by Touch Bionics, is controlled with a smartphone app. The supermarket store trainer lost his left hand in an accident in 1984. He is now able to control the hand with the app, which can change grip and position. ‘Originally my prosthesis was operated with a cable and it could be moved so the hand opened and closed. The service is based at the WestMARC unit at Southern General Hospital, and at the SMART Centre in Edinburgh. Health Secretary Alex Neil is pictured, right, talking to amputee Ian Robin, left, at the launch of the state-of-the-art national prosthetics service . ‘This new hand I have, it's like . chalk and cheese in comparison with the original, the other just did the . basics and now I can change my movements using an app on my phone. 'I can change the type of grips I have, and the arm reacts to the electric signals sent by my upper arm in the muscle. ‘It has massively improved my life, I can pick up glasses, I can even use it to tie my shoelace.' Anthony Stickland, 53, lost most of his right leg when he was 17. At . the launch of the centre, Stickland demonstrated a system of cameras . and motion sensors, which specialists are using to create a 3D image of . how his limb is moving.

Retired Lieutenant Colonel Geoff Ward, 66, was clearing bombs when he stepped on a plastic mine, forcing doctors to amputate his right leg just below his knee. The grandfather-of-one spent three weeks in hospital before returning to the UK, and within six weeks was back at work after being fitted with his prosthetic limb. He said: ‘The first foot was just like a plastic lump and reinforced plastic. 'This one moves up and down and around, the foot has a set of springs all made out of carbon fibre - it's 'Formula One' technology. ‘The metal bits that hold it together are all titanium so they're incredibly strong and silicon which goes next to the skin and is all very soft all lined with carbon fibre, it's from a different planet - it's terrific.’ In a separate project, 3D design company Autodesk and the University of Toronto are experimenting with different ways of scanning limbs and creating customised 3D prosthetic socket models, for use in Uganda.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Most of us take telling the time for granted. But for visually impaired people it can be a real struggle and sometimes a speaking clock just isn’t practical. However, a new tactile watch is about to hit the shops that lets people tell the time just by touching it – and it’s so stylish that many people with perfect vision are also ordering one for themselves. The Bradley Timepiece has a minimalistic titanium face with gently protruding markings, but no numbers or hands. Scroll down for video . It's about time! The Bradley Timepiece (pictured left) lets people tell the time using their sense of touch. It is named after Paralympic gold medal winner Bradley Snyder (pictured right) and features two distinctive grooves with ball bearings set inside them that denote the minutes and hours of the day . Instead of traditional watch hands, time is indicated by two ball bearings. The one towards the centre of the watch indicates the passing minutes and one marking the hours is positioned on the side. The ball bearings are connected to a watch movement beneath the casing with magnets. If the ball bearings are pressed a little too hard and are moved accidently, a user can shake their wrist and they spring back to show the correct time. Its unique feature is two ball bearings set into grooves that people can touch to tell the time. The ball in the central groove rotates to mark the minutes, while another set into the side of the timepiece travels round the face to denote the hours. Designer Hyungsoo Kim, CEO of E-onetime, which is based in Washington DC, designed the quirky timepiece while he was a student at MIT. ‘Most clocks and watches require vision and checking the time is still a big problem if you're visually impaired. We wanted to develop a timepiece where you can touch time,’ he said. ‘This is a timepiece and not a watch because you don’t have to watch this to tell the time.’ Touch the time: As well as helping visually impaired people live independently Mr Kim explained it's been a hit with people with perfect sight too. There are occasions - from lectures and job interviews to dinner with the in-laws - when looking at a watch is considered rude and telling the time by touch solves that problem, he said . Because of its striking design, the timepiece is proving a hit with everyone and Mr Kim explained that there are so many occasions – from lectures and job interviews to dinner with the in-laws – when looking at a watch or smartphone is considered rude and telling the time by touch solves the problem. The Bradley Timepiece is named after a Paralympian gold medallist who lost his sight in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Bradley Snyder served with the U.S. Navy in Afghanistan, dealing with unexploded devices, until one day in 2011 he was blinded when one of the IEDs blew up in his face. While he went on to win two gold medals and a silver in swimming at the 2012 Paralympics in London, adjusting to everyday life was difficult for him – particularly telling the time. Having a ball: The timepiece's unique feature is two ball bearings set into grooves that people can touch to tell the time. The ball in the centre groove rotates to mark the minutes (pictured) while another set into the side of the timepiece travels round the face to denote the hours . Mr Synder told the BBC: ‘You don't realise how much you use time to orient where you are. At the beginning it was very disorienting. And especially being in the military, time is all important.’ After meeting Mr Lim through a mutual friend, he became the face of the watch, which is hoped will change many more people’s lives when it launches this summer. Mr Synder had been using a speaking watch, but said: ‘as soon as I hit that button it highlights me as someone with a special need. I love the idea of using the same thing that everyone does. And I want to feel as normal as possible.’ There are a number of watches for visually impaired people currently available, including one that vibrates to denote the hour and minutes of the day, those with tactile or braille faces – which look similar to traditional watches – and of course the talking watches. Neil Heslop, RNIB Group Director Solutions, told MailOnline: 'Design is just as important for people with sight loss as it is for sighted people. 'What’s great about the Bradley Timepiece is that it is accessible to everyone but it also looks good and that combination is incredibly powerful.' Colourful: Despite initially being developed for people who cannot see how good their watch looks, the Bradley Timepiece is up for design of the year at London's Design Museum and its slick titanium body gives it widespread appeal. The timepiece is even available with three different coloured straps . The Bradley Timepiece is up for design of the year at London’s Design Museum and its slick titanium body gives it widespread appeal. The timepiece is even available with three different coloured straps. Mr Kim and his team of designers originally raised money on crowd funding website Kickstarter last summer to put their product into production, attracting $594,602 (£357,290). The ‘watch’ launches in the U.S. in May for $195 (£117) if it is pre-ordered and $275 (£164) thereafter. It will be available in the UK and Europe later in the year. The company said that just one to two per cent of people that have so far pre-ordered the watch are visually impaired. It is one of 76 nominations for the Designs of the Year competition at London’s Design Museum.

"By . Mark Prigg . Google's attempt to register the word 'Glass' as s a trademark for its electronic glasses has been stalled by the United States' Trademark Office. The firm is involved in a long-running row over the word, with experts claiming it is too generic to be patented and the USTO rejecting Google's application. Google, on the other hand, claims the word applies to its entire glass product, which includes frames, and not just the glass component. A trademark examiner raised two objections, one of which was that the trademark was too similar to other trademarks containing the word 'glass', which could lead to confusion for consumers. While Google has already registered the term 'Google Glass' as a trademark, a report in the Wall Street Journal this week revealed that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has objected to the 'Glass' trademark application, submitted last year. According to the report, a trademark examiner raised two objections, one of which was that the trademark was too similar to other trademarks containing the word 'glass', which could lead to confusion for consumers. The other objection was that the word 'glass' was merely descriptive, ans that such generic terms cannot be trademarked under US federal law. Google's trademark attorneys wrote a 1,928-page letter to the government in response to the Trademark Office's decision to stall the trademark application. However, the letter from Google's lawyers contained around 1,900 articles about Google Glass, with the remainder of the letter disputing the trademark examiner’s objection that using the word 'glass' as a trademark would confuse consumers and the assertion that it was merely a descriptive word. It also singled out other firms that have the word glass in their logo. The Trademark Office has yet to make a final ruling on the application. The USTO document concluded that 'Glass' would be 'be understood as describing a feature of some the goods, namely, that some of the goods will incorporate display screens and/or lenses that are or will be made of, inter alia, glass.' Although Google is not required to trademark the word in order to use it for its glasses device, if the company is not to able to register ‘Glass’ as a trademark, it will make it much harder to counter trademark infringements. Similarities between Google Glass and other existing trademarks, including Write on Glass, Glass3D and Teleglass, are also likely to confuse consumers, it is believed. The Trademark Office has yet to make a final ruling on the application.","Claims the word glass is too generic to trademark .

"By . Mark Prigg . Astronomers have spotted a heart-shaped crater on the surface of Mars. Located close to a huge volcano or the surface of the red planet, Nasa says the strange shape may have been caused by a volcano. However, the space agency is so intrigued by the unusual shape is plans to train its telescopes on the 'broken heart' again to try and work out exactly how big it is. is so intrigued by the unusual shape is plans to train its HiRISE  telescope on the 'broken heart' again to try and work out exactly how big it is . The heart is located south of Ascraeus Mons, which is a large volcano within the Tharsis volcanic plateau, so it is extremely likely that this feature was formed by a volcanic process. 'The feature indeed does look like a heart,' researchers on Nasa's HiRISE telescope, which took the image, said. It is located south of Ascraeus Mons, which is a large volcano within the Tharsis volcanic plateau, so it is extremely likely that this feature was formed by a volcanic process. 'The feature rises above the surrounding terrain and we can see concentric ridges on its top. 'Perhaps this feature is an ancient vent structure (an opening in the ground from which volcanic lava emerges) that has been more resistant to erosion than the surrounding area, so that it resembles 'inverted' terrains,' said Nasa. Topographic inversion or inverted terrain often occurs when low areas of a landscape become filled with lava or sediments that harden into materials which are more resistant to erosion than the materials that surround them. Erosion then removes the less resistant surrounding material, leaving behind the younger resistant material which may then appear as a ridge where previously there was a valley, or in this case, a butte, where there was once a pit or depression. The agency now plans to return to try and measure the ridges.Additional imaging of the feature to create a stereo and a digital terrain model may help in further assessing the structure by making accurate measurement of its height and the steepness of its slopes. The blue planet: Nasa also released these false colour images which show dunes on the surface. The lighter toned tan surfaces are composed of a thick layer of dust, Nasa said. The team also revealed this new image of pruple sand on the surface. Sand on Mars is typically dark in tone, as it commonly derived from volcanic rocks like lava flows. In HiRISE enhanced color, which operates in long infrared wavelengths (beyond what the human eye can detect), surfaces like these dune crests are dark blue to purple. Sand comes in sizes that are ideal for surface transport by the wind, where sand 'hops' along forming bedforms, like these dunes after large amounts of time.","Believe unusual shape was caused by volcanic activity .

"By . Scarlett Russell . A British woman has spoken about how her 16-year spending addiction spiralled so far out of control, she considered suicide. Vikki Appleton, 29, from Cardiff told This Morning that she had over £200,000 worth of debt by the age of 19. During her teenage and university years, Ms Appleton would foot the bill on extravagant nights out with friends, go on round-the-world holidays and even donate money to charity. Scroll down for video . Big spender: Vicki Appleton says her spending started around the age of 13 when she had her first weekend job and would rush to spend her wages as quickly as she could . Out of control: Now 29, and in therapy for her spending addiction, Vicki Appleton still admits to 'urges' and counteracts them by buying healthy food from her local supermarket . ‘It was a buzz akin to bungee jumping or doing any extreme sports and adding value to other people’s lives felt like a buzz in itself,' she told Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on the morning magazine show. ‘When you are desperately low on self-esteem you will cling on to anything that makes you feel like you are worth being around for.’ Ms Appleton says her spending addiction started when she landed her first weekend job at 13 and would rush to spend her wages. 'I'd be very surprised if I'd go home after that pay day with any money left over,' she said. She didn't realise there was a problem, but in hindsight can see how dangerous it was. And it wasn't until she reached 18 when the problem spiralled out of control. 'A credit card arrived through my door that I hadn't applied for with a limit of around £1,500 and I thought that was free money,' she says. 'Somebody had deemed me good enough to have it and, in my mind, I was OK with it.' Ms Appleton was later diagnosed with biopolar disorder, but at the time says she ‘missed all the warning signs.' ‘Despite reading lots of articles and being well-versed in symptoms of bipolar, the mental illness and my spending didn’t seem to be linked,’ she said. ‘It was only in the last year it occurred  to me that the two were linked.’ She also admitted to owning ‘at least’ 15 cars - one she bought before she could learn to drive - and renting ’40 or 50.’ ‘I don't think I've ever kept a car longer than a year,’ she said. From the sofa: Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby interview Vicki Appleton and Psychotherapist and Wealth Addiction expert, Caroline Curtis Dolby, on This Morning . By the time she was 19, red letters and warnings from debt collectors and credit card companies were arriving thick and fast, but Ms Appleton panicked and fled to the Welsh Valleys to start a new life, going to university and ignoring the letters her grandmother would forward her. During university she worked full time as well as studying and taking out student loans to ‘feed my crazy lifestyle,’ she said. ‘I was out three or four nights a week and made sure I had the best of everything. ‘I had top-of-the-range cameras for my photography degree. ‘In my mind I was well-justified having the best of everything.’ After . university Ms Appleton took out more loans and credit cards and . traveled around Asia, running out of money and relying on her . grandmother to lend her cash for a flight home. ‘My boyfriend at the time was horrified,’ she said. ‘His family were very financially astute, his mother even worked for the financial services dealing with people in debt. Expert help: Vicki Appleton, left, shared the This Morning sofa with psychotherapist and wealth addiction expert, Caroline Curtis Dolby, right, who cited her problem as co-occurring disorder . ‘They tried to help me and were mortified. I didn’t listen to their warnings.’ She then became pregnant and was offered a new job. She moved to a bigger house but eventually lost the job and found herself penniless and homeless. Ms Appleton asked grandparents to pick son up and starting writing a suicide note to her son. ‘It was a heartfelt, emotional outpouring of regret at the fact I was capable of living a normal lifestyle,’ she says. ‘I was ill equipped. A shockingly awful mother to him.’ Writing the letter made Ms Appleton realise how serious her problem had become. She called a helpline and a mental health team arrived at her house within an hour. Psychotherapist and wealth addiction expert, Caroline Curtis Dolby, pictured here, said, 'Every person needs to understand their condition and then be willing to work with that condition' ‘They told me, “We’re not going to force you to do anything but we recommend that you try going into psychiatric care. We believe it will help you,”’ she said. ‘I wouldn’t even have fought being sectioned at that point. ‘I was desperate for help and would have done anything.’ Still undergoing therapy, Ms Appleton goes back to the unit every two weeks for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and takes medication for her bipolar disorder. The urges to spend, however, still haunt her. ‘It’s a chemical desire and still does overwhelm me,’ she acknowledges. To combat the urge she’ll head to her local supermarket to stock up on fruit, vegetables and tins of food. ‘After feeling suicidal, I have re-designed my entire life,’ she said. ‘I am working towards being the optimum person I would choose to be.’ Ms Appleton was joined on the This Morning sofa by psychotherapist and wealth addiction expert Caroline Curtis Dolby, who named her problem as 'co-occurring disorder'. ‘Bipolar and addiction sit next door to one another,’ said Curtis Dolby. ‘Every person needs to understand their condition and then be willing to work with that condition. ‘It’s getting well and working toward a place where you can live within your own skin comfortably.’","Vicki Appleton, 29 from Cardiff, ignored letters from credit card companies .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A blogger well known for her stance on body image issues, as well as her own experience with body dysmorphia, has petitioned Francesca Bellettini, CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, to stop using painfully thin models in its campaigns. Shannon Bradley-Colleary, a 48-year-old mother of two pre-teen daughters, was outraged when she stumbled across a Saint Laurent Paris ad campaign in Vanity Fair last month, starring what appears to her to be a severely 'malnourished' model. 'My first reaction was, what the hell?' she writes on her blog The Woman Formally Known As Beautiful, labeling the image 'cruel', both to the model 'if she isn't naturally thin', and to the young girls who will be exposed to it. Scroll down for video . Too thin? Blogger Shannon Bradley-Colleary was shocked to see this model in a Saint Laurent Paris campaign (pictured) and has petitioned the label's CEO, Francesca Bellettini, to stop using 'malnourished' models . Mrs Bradley-Colleary argues that inevitably, some women 'of a certain age' will begin to believe that this is 'the standard of beauty.' She goes on to point out that less two per cent of all women (and men) in the U.S. are genetically inclined to be this thin naturally. 'This means 98 per cent of women would have to deprive themselves in order to achieve this look,' she laments. Inspired by a 16-year-old girl who successfully petitioned Seventeen Magazine to stop Photoshopping their models, Mrs Bradley-Colleary launched her own on Change.org, and quickly amassed over 40,000 signatures. 'We request that you stop using images . depicting models who may be malnourished or have a dangerously low BMI,' the petition reads. High fashion: Mrs Bradley-Colleary considers the images 'cruel' both to the model (pictured in another shot from the same campaign) and to the impressionable girls who are exposed to it . It goes on to suggest that booking these girls is sending a message to other models that they have to be 'uber thin to get work' and to lead young girls and women into 'serious eating disorders', some of which may result in death. A representative for Yves Saint Laurent was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline. Mrs Bradley-Colleary is already known for her vocal stance on issues surrounding body image. In 2012, at the age of 46, she stripped down to recreate a nude photo shoot she had taken part in some 20 years ago, posting the images from both side-by-side, along with her own surprised reaction. 'Who is that fat, dimpled, wrinkly, broad-flanked person? That isn't me? That can't be me??!!' she wrote in her piece for the Huffington Post. She . later made her peace with her age-morphed body shape and is evidently . now keen to make changes to the industry she believes, in part, spawned . her negative self-image. Naked ambition: Mrs Bradley-Colleary posed nude at 25 when she hated her body (left) and again at 46 (right) and was herself horrified by the more . recent photographs . The passage of time: The mother-of-two has since accepted the skin she lives in but is trying to make changes to the industry she feels prompted her body dimorphic disorder in the first place . It's not a belief shared by fellow blogger - and incidental friend - Jenni Chiu, who penned a rebuttal to Mrs Bradley-Colleary's petition, which was later published on the Huffington Post, entitled, Don't Make the Thin Girl Ugly. 'My problem is that we don't know that . this young woman is actually anorexic,' she writes. 'Isn’t assuming all . skinny girls are anorexic just as bad as assuming all bigger girls are . unhealthy?' Ms Chiu, also a . mother of two, and a former self-confessed member of the two per cent . elite, claims she had been naturally thin all her life (until she had . two children, she points out) and suffered repeated accusations of . anorexia as well as being branded 'toothpick,' 'boobless,' and a 'stick . figure.' 'I ate four large meals a day, . numerous snacks, and spent several months on weight gain shakes so the . name calling would stop.  It didn’t,' she recalls. Clash: Ms Chui (right) wrote a rebuttal to Mrs Bradley-Colleary's (left) petition, arguing that banning thin models isn't the answer and that we should be demanding all body types to be represented instead . Ms Chui admits that being thin did 'open doors' to a short but lucrative career as a fashion model and tells MailOnline that she 'absolutely' misses her naturally skinny days. However, as she struggles to feel completely comfortable with her post-baby body, she doesn't blame the media for making her feel pressured. 'Banning thin models and calling them anorexic isn’t the answer. Thin-ness isn’t the enemy – exclusivity is,' she argues. 'Instead of banning one body type, we should instead be demanding all body types.' She pointed to Dove as one of the companies leading the departure from favoring 'a certain body type' to include women of all shapes and sizes, and believes the industry is changing. Banning thin models and calling them . anorexic isn’t the answer. Instead of banning one body type, we should instead be . demanding all body types. Ms Chui sparked a heated debate on what Mrs Bradley-Colleary described as her 'skinny bashing', with many readers hitting back at her standpoint. 'Thin women who occasionally receive negative feedback from their thinness can cry me a river,' responded one. 'You look sickly and bony and if others try to emulate you they run the risk of becoming sick too,' commented another. Ms Chiu subsequently wrote a follow up piece on her blog, Mommy Nani Booboo and she stood her ground. 'Dissecting and judging someone else's body, and then using that to pass judgement on them and their life as a whole should not be acceptable,' she wrote, suggesting that this was not taking the right path toward 'promoting healthy body image.' Ever since waifish supermodel Kate Moss exploded onto the scene in the late nineties with her lean 'heroin-chic' aesthetic, a new standard was born and the debate on what should be acceptable in the fashion industry has raged ever since. Following intense pressure, there have been repeated efforts in the past on behalf on key fashion influencers to buck the accusations that they are irresponsibly leading young women into eating disorders. Victoria Beckham banned size zero models from her New York show in 2010, while the Italian fashion houses Armani, Prada and Versace have all said they have done the same. Waifish: Kate Moss, pictured here in 1992, sparked the long-enduring skinny trend when she first hit supermodel stardom, causing a debate that has raged for decades . And in 2012 Vogue editors from across the . globe, led by Anna Wintour, pledged to ban the use of models under 16 . in photo shoots and promised not to use models they know to be suffering . from eating disorders. Still, true to form, this year's New York Fashion Week featured a number of excruciatingly thin models, including Australia's Next Top Model winner, 21-year-old Cassi Van Den Dungen, who faced a bitter backlash for her noticeably gaunt appearance at Alex Perry's Autumn/Winter show. In line with Ms Chui, the model hit back at her critics, posting a photo to her Instagram account yesterday of her breakfast, which included two butter croissants and a banana. 'Love my job, love food, I am who I am, deal with it' [sic] she wrote alongside it. Courting controversy: Model Cassi Van Den Dungen faced a recent backlash after appearing at this year's New York Fashion Week looking skeletal, in spite of many designers and fashion editors promising over the years not to promote an irresponsible ideal . In the case of Mrs Bradley-Colleary's . blog post on the Saint Laurent ad, the writer later tweaked her rhetoric 'in order to be more . respectful to the model in the photo' - but the petition stands. 'I still think my petition has value and is important for the 99 per cent of women who are not underweight in America,' she writes. As for relationship between the opposing friends and bloggers, Ms Chui says to MailOnline: 'I think Shannon and I share the same goal, which is to see a wider range of bodies represented in the fashion industry and media.' Just under 5,000 more signatures are required for Mrs Bradley-Colleary to reach her target of 50,000, and she says that if she is successful in her mission, she intends to begin a movement to get all advertisers to use healthy woman, 'one ad campaign at a time.'",Shannon Bradley-Colleary has spoken publicly of her own struggles with body dysmorphic disorder .

"By . Associated Press . The U.S. will not grant a visa to Tehran's controversial pick for envoy to the United Nations, the Obama administration said today, in a rare diplomatic rebuke. The U.S. government had previously said only that it opposed the nomination . of envoy Hamid Aboutalebi, who was a member of the group responsible for the . 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. U.S. officials had hoped . the issue could be resolved by Tehran simply withdrawing the nomination. Scroll down for video . The U.S. has denied a visa for Iran's envoy to the UN Hamid Aboutalebi. He was a member of the group responsible for the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran . 'We've communicated with the Iranians . at a number of levels and made clear our position on this - and that . includes our position that the selection was not viable,' White House . spokesman Jay Carney said. 'Our position is that we will not be issuing . him a visa.' Denying visas . to U.N. ambassadorial nominees or to foreign heads of state who want to . attend United Nations events in the United States is unusual, if not . unprecedented. The move comes amid a possible thaw in . the decades-long diplomatic freeze between the U.S. and Iran, as the . two countries negotiate a deal to curb Tehran's disputed nuclear . program. Aboutalebi is alleged to have participated in a Muslim student group that held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days during the takeover. The crisis was the subject of the 2012 Oscar-winning film Argo. His nomination has outraged members of Congress, who passed a bill barring entry to the U.S. to an individual found to be engaged in espionage, terrorism or a threat to national security. Carney would not say whether President Barack Obama would sign the bill but said the president shares its sentiments. United Nations officials had no immediate comment on the U.S. decision. An Anti-American crowd demonstrates outside the U.S. Embassy in November 1979. The fanatical followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini had earlier stormed the U.S. building in Tehran, occupied the building and took nearly 100 embassy staff and Marines hostages . Iran has called U.S. rejection of Aboutalebi 'not acceptable,' with Iranian state television quoting Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham as saying Aboutalebi is one of the country's best diplomats and arguing that he previously received a U.S. visa. Aboutalebi has insisted his involvement in the group involved in the embassy takeover, Muslim Students Following the Imam's Line, was limited to translation and negotiation. Iranian officials said they had submitted a visa application for Aboutalebi, but it was unclear whether the U.S. actually denied the request or simply decided not to act on it. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said the administration was prohibited from discussing the matter in detail because visa cases are confidential. In past problematic cases - such as with a previous Iranian nominee in the early 1990s and more recently with Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir - the U.S. has either signaled opposition to the applicant and the request has been withdrawn, or the State Department has simply declined to process the application. Those options, as well as approving or denying the application, are available in the current case. U.S. immigration law allows broad rejection of visas to foreigners and, in many cases, authorities do not have to give an explicit reason why other than to deem the applicant a threat to national security or American policy. The law bars foreigners whose entry or activity in the U.S. would 'have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States'.

"By . Simon Cable . Back in the Swinging Sixties, getting ready was a bit of a chore. After scrubbing yourself in the bath with a bar of Pears soap, you might have doused yourself in talc, applied your pat-on deodorant and revamped your hairdo with a generous coating of hair lacquer. These days it seems we’re too busy – and hi-tech – for all that faff, relying on quick-fix dry shampoo to freshen our hair, electric face cleaning brushes to buff our skin and anti-ageing serum to protect it. Scroll down for video . Gone are the days when a girl would need hours to preen herself ahead of a big night out, scrubbing in the bath with a bar of Pears soap, applying pat-on deodorant and applying generous coatings of hair lacquer. Today our lives are too busy for all that faff, leaving women to rely on a spritz of dry shampoo and lashings of lip gloss . The contrast between the beauty regimes of women 50 years ago and today has been revealed by cosmetics chain Superdrug, which has marked its half-century by compiling a selection of its best-selling beauty products. A Rimmel advertisement for ‘beauty on a budget’, which featured in a 1964 edition of Woman magazine, shows how women stocked their bathrooms and dressing tables with cleansing milk, perfumed talc and cologne. But while we might be saving time on our beauty regimes today, we’re forking out a lot more than our 1960s counterparts did. When Superdrug first opened its doors, the Rimmel products in the advertisement, ranging from block mascara to pat-on deodorant, all cost one shilling and sixpence, or 7.5p in today’s money. Now you’d have to part with £10.99 for a Max Factor mascara, while a deodorant spray costs £1. In the 1960s Rimmel’s quaintly named anti-wrinkle cream cost pennies. Today L’Oreal’s Revitalift anti-ageing serum will leave you £14.99 worse off.  Meanwhile hi-tech gadgets such as a sonic face brush for exfoliating the skin would set you back £129.99, while a red light therapy spotlight, which helps reduce blemishes, costs £69.99. Cosmetics chain Superdrug has marked its half century by highlighting the differences between beauty regimes today and those of our mothers and grandmothers in the 1950s . Two other items on today’s  list of essentials that have grown  in popularity since the 1960s include face cleansing wipes and dry shampoo, a fragranced powder used between washes to refresh the hair. Then there are the products that have stood the test of time. We still can’t live without make-up essentials such as lipstick, eyeshadow, liquid eyeliner, bronzer and moisturising lotion – although the 1960s packaging and applicators may look rather old-fashioned. And colour-enhancing shampoo was also on shopping lists 50 years ago. Yesterday singer Lulu, who shot to stardom in 1964 following the release of her single Shout! kicked off the Superdrug anniversary celebrations. Recalling how she achieved her wide-eyed 1960s look with mascara, the 65-year-old said: ‘We used to have a dirty block and a little brush and you used to have to spit on the block. It was so unsophisticated. The make-up was harsh and thick. Singer Lulu, pictured left in 1964, was on hand yesterday at Superdrug on Putney High Street to launch 50 years of the popular brand . ‘Today there is so much choice when it comes to hair and make-up, even compared to ten or 20 years ago. 'That said, the classics still prevail and there are many names around that I remember buying as a teenager such as Rimmel, Pears soap.’ She added: ‘Teenage girls still have the same problems now as I did then. They still obsess about their looks. And her own beauty essentials? ‘I always have to have a lip pencil and mascara and a good pair of sunglasses. But as you get older, I’d say that less is more when it comes to make-up,’ she said.","In days gone by a girl would have to set aside hours for her beauty regime .

"By . David Kent . Despite experiencing a 'baptism of fire' in charge of Tottenham, Tim Sherwood says he only has his mind on managing again after this season. The 38-year-old will leave the club at the end of the season having failed to impress Daniel Levy after Andre Villas Boas' sacking in December. And Sherwood admits he 'couldn't do without' management, playing down reports of a future as an assistant. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tim Sherwood talk ahead of Saturday's West Brom clash . Caught the bug: Tim Sherwood says he has loved his experience at Tottenham and only wants more . You're the man: Sherwood salutes Emmanuel Adebayor after the striker scored against Sunderland on Monday . 'I have,' said Sherwood after being asked whether he had enjoyed his time at the club. 'It's been an honour to manage this great football club.It's been different, it's an an experience like no other.' 'Unless you've ever stood in that technical area and had the expectation of the whole football club then you don't really know what it's like to be a manager. 'I've enjoyed it and perversely I've enjoyed the pressure. I'm not sure I could do without it now.' As well as denying he had talks over a No 2 role, he also rejected claims he would be interested in the Norwich job, calling it disrespectful. Tottenham travel to play West Brom this weekend, and despite the hosts needing points to secure their Premier League survival, Sherwood insists the match is just as important for his side. 'Any other club's need can't be greater than ours. We need to win. We've got five Cup finals left and I think we can take maximum points from those games.' Playmaker: The victory against the Black Cats, inspired by Christian Eriksen, helped Spurs regain some form . Big game: They face West Brom at the weekend, a team who are fighting for their lives at the bottom . One worry for Tottenham, and possibly England, is the fitness of Kyle Walker. The right-back has been out of action in recent weeks with a pelvic problem, and his manager says that although the injury is worrying, he is sure he will still make the plane to Brazil to play in the World Cup this summer. 'We're concerned immediately because he's not fit and it would be very doubtful if he were fit for next week. 'He's still got  a lot of time before the World Cup and Kyle is one of the best right backs - I'm sure he'll be on the plane even if he doesn't make an appearance for Tottenham before the end of the season.' Fight against time: Kyle Walker is no nearer to making a comeback with his World Cup dream now in doubt . Louis Van Gaal is the favourite to be made the next permanent manager at White Hart Lane, but Sherwood has been consistent in refusing to talk about the future of the club. 'It's just about me concentrating on the game and today I'm concentrating on the game tomorrow. I think those questions are not for me to answer. Its just for me to worry about football matches and hopefully trying to win the next five games for Tottenham. 'That will iron itself out in due course. For me to worry about preparing the team, like I've done this week. We had a good week's training and we're really going to West Brom on the front foot and trying to entertain those great Tottenham fans and get three points. 'The speculation has never eased since I came in. I've always fended off the questions. I don't see a difference from the first hour to now.' Summer switch?

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . Homeowners in south-west London have nearly £30billion of mortgage debt, more than in all of Wales, a report revealed yesterday. The figures, from the Council of Mortgage Lenders, raise fears about a housing bubble in the capital with new records being broken every day. Estate agents say prices in the SW postcode area, which includes Balham, Brixton, Chelsea, Clapham, Earlsfield and Fulham, have risen by up to 30 per cent in a year. The SW11 postcode of Battersea, pictured, has seen house prices rise up to 30 per cent in a year . The amount owed on homes in the area is now £29.4billion, compared with only £28.6billion for the whole of Wales. The two figures highlight the extraordinary gulf between house prices in London and the rest of Britain. While the average cost of a home in Wales is currently £140,000, below the national average, the average in London is nearly £365,000. Of 10,834 UK postcodes analysed by the council, the one with most mortgage debt was ‘SW11 6’. An exclusive enclave, it covers around 4,370 homes in Battersea and Clapham Junction, including those on Broomwood Road and Manchuria Road. Its residents have £665million of mortgage debt, with many young couples taking out huge loans to buy homes which now sell for around £1.1million, according to the property website Zoopla. Hundreds of miles further north, the smallest mortgage debt can be found in ‘IV48 8’, which includes the Isle of Skye. The figure for the whole of this picturesque district is just £633,183, the size of some individual mortgages in south-west London. South west London alone owes £29.4 billion in residential mortgage loans . Paula Higgins, of the Homeowners’ Alliance, a campaign group, warned families might not be able to cope when rates rise from their lows of the past five years. ‘There is a bit of a frenzy out there. People really need to make sure that they can afford their mortgage in the long term,’ she said. Peter Rollings, of estate agents Marsh & Parsons, said demand in south-west London was ‘particularly buoyant’. A small two-bedroom flat in Fulham went on the market for £495,000 last week and has already had 41 visits and three bids at the asking price. The SW postcode area, includes Balham, Brixton, Chelsea, Clapham, Earlsfield and Fulham . He said some clients were being priced out of central London, including one couple now buying a £2.2million house in Clapham. ‘If they had bought in Chelsea, the same property would have cost £5million,’ he said. ‘In south-west London, we have 48 potential buyers registered for each available property.’ Matthew Pointon, a property analyst at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the CML’s figures ‘support the argument of bubble-like activity in parts of London’. The council’s breakdown puts total mortgage debt at £897billion. Its figures cover three quarters of the market and exclude smaller building societies and other lenders. Estate agents said houses were also selling quickly in some parts of Wales. David Baker, an estate agent in Penarth, South Glamorgan, said: ‘We have had more completions in the last three months than any other three consecutive months in the last 30 years.’ Kelvin Francis, from Cardiff, said gazumping was happening there for the first time since 2007. Nationwide says the gap between the cost of a home in the capital and the rest of the UK is the widest that it has ever been.","House prices in the SW postcode area have risen up to 30 per cent in a year .

You put a gadget in its tray, then it identifies it using a camera, matching it up against a database of 4,000 different gadgets. It then offers you a cable to plug in your device, and checks if it's still in working order electronically - EcoATM promises it will not steal data from the devices. Once its analysis is complete, it gives you a quote on the spot, based on what a network of hundreds of electronics-recycling companies are willing to pay for it. If you accept, it spits out cash.

"By . Mark Duell . It might not be the most flashy of cars in which to perform a ram raid - but this criminal got what he wanted, even though he was caught four months later and jailed for life. Wayne Colligan, 43, drove his Nissan Micra into the Halifax building society in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, to grab almost £70,000 as staff loaded the cashpoint, before driving off. One bank worker was left on the floor with damaged ligaments after she was forced to jump out of the vehicle’s path, before Colligan shouted ‘This is a f****** raid’ and stole £68,450 in less than a minute.

Colligan, who was wearing two sets of . gloves and armed with a loaded pistol, admitted he was ‘bang to rights’, . adding: ‘It’s a fair cop’. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve at least seven years and eight months. Firearm: Colligan was caught last year, wearing two sets of gloves and armed with a loaded pistol (pictured) Accomplice David Cope, 49, who played ‘a minor role’ by acquiring the vehicles for the raids, was given four years. Judge . Nicholas Cooke QC said: ‘Attacks on high street banks in broad daylight . terrify the public and bank employees. The offending at the heart of . this indictment amounts to professionally planned commercial robbery. ‘You . are a professional criminal, and as carrying a semi-automatic pistol . clearly illustrates, potentially a very dangerous man. It is agreed by . all parties that you are liable to a mandatory life sentence.’ Colligan . had been released early on licence from an 11-year sentence for robbing . a Halifax bank in Harold Hill, Essex, back in 2003. The . judge commented: ‘The reality is it [the gun] has a round in the breach . and the slide is back, therefore it is very close to firing condition’. He added that the failed raid in Wanstead was ‘in literary terms at least, within the shadow of Snaresbrook Crown Court’. In . 2006, Colligan was accused of involvement in the shooting of Cameron .

Colligan’s then associate, career criminal Wayne Ellis, 39, of Manor Park, east London, later received 15 years for the point-blank shooting.

"By . Suzannah Hills . A student has been fined for driving a car without any doors, lights or bonnet - and using his arms to indicate when turning. Sam Wilson mistakenly believed the Peugeot 306 was still legal to drive, despite the missing doors, headlights, indicators, bonnet and brake lights, because it had a valid MOT certificate. The 25-year-old drove the car, described by police as a 'skeleton of a vehicle', for almost three miles before he was pulled over. Wilson, who studies electrical engineering at college and works part-time as a pizza delivery man, was attempting to take it to a recycling centre five miles from his home in Bingham, Nottinghamshire, to sell for scrap. He had already removed a selection of parts to sell online. 'Skeleton of a car': Sam Wilson, 25, was pulled over by police while driving this Peugeot 306 which had no doors, headlights, indicator, bonnet or brake lights . Mistaken: The father-of-two, who removed the car parts so he could sell them individually for more money, claimed he thought he could still legally drive the car on public roads as it had a valid MOT . The father-of-two was found guilty of using a vehicle when its use involved a danger of injury to any person and was fined £110 at Nottingham Magistrates' Court.  He was also ordered to pay £120 costs and given three penalty points on his licence. After the hearing, Wilson said: 'The car didn't have any lights on it, but my argument was that it was daylight. It didn't have any signals either, but I used arm signals to indicate.' Wilson added he thought the car was safe to drive because it still had an MOT certificate - and said he hadn't removed any of what he thought were key working parts. He said there were kit cars on the road that also lacked features such as doors and lights. Wilson, who studies electrical engineering at college, said: 'I only did it so I could get more money back for the car. In court: Sam Wilson, from Bingham, Notts, was fined £110 after he was found guilty of using a vehicle when its use involved a danger of injury to a person . 'I wouldn't have driven it if I didn't think it was safe for the road. 'I was starting college and I was . only going to get £150 at the scrapyard, so I thought if I took the . doors off and a few other parts I could get more money back.' He added he had 'learned his lesson' and 'wouldn't make the same mistake again'. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: 'There are strict rules governing the safety of vehicles in this country. 'It . wouldn't have taken much to realise that the skeleton of a vehicle . Wilson was trying to drive on the carriageway was not roadworthy. 'It . beggars belief that he thought he could drive it without anyone having . concerns. 'In doing so he put the safety of himself and others at risk. We had to take action.' The car was eventually collected for scrap and Wilson was paid £70. He has since bought a new Peugeot. A spokesman for the AA said: 'It's plan daft to strip everything off a car and then drive it on a public road. 'The main point here is that cars are designed to minimise crashes and injuries. 'If a car that has been stripped of its body work then hits a pedestrian, there's a risk sharp edges that would have been covered up could cause much worse injuries to the person involved. 'Also, new cars have day time headlights that warn pedestrians a car is heading their way. If these are removed, then the pedestrian won't have that extra time to see the car coming towards them. 'If this person had hit someone, and his alterations to the car made the difference as to whether the pedestrian survived or not, he could have been in a lot more trouble than he is now. 'He has got off lightly.' How it used to look: Wilson decided to remove all the parts from the car after being told he would only get £150 for the entire vehicle at a scrapyard . It is illegal to drive a vehicle on public roads in the UK without a valid MOT test - except to and from the garage where a pre-booked test or remedial work is being carried out. An MOT checks a vehicle's lights, indicators, . tyres, brakes and bodywork. It is illegal to drive a car that has failed to pass the test on any of these. An MOT certificate proves a car is road worthy on the day it is tested. But while an MOT test would still be valid after major damage is caused to a vehicle, it would still be illegal to drive it if it were no longer road worthy. Individuals are responsible for making sure their vehicles remain in a road worthy condition. So a vehicle isn't road worthy if the headlights don't work, it has faulty brakes, worn out tyres or seatbelts that don't work, even if the MOT is still within date. A driver can be stopped by police and prosecuted for driving a vehicle not in a road worthy condition.","Sam Wilson used his arms to indicate after removing vital car parts .

"By . Reuters . and Daily Mail Reporter . The Winter Olympics city of Sochi, Russia used to be a haven for gays during the Soviet-era, but the community there has mostly fled the country following President Vladimir Putin's ban on 'gay propaganda'. Mayak Caberet is one of the last gay clubs left, and doesn't even really function as a bar for homosexuals anymore since most of the customers are straight couples who come to watch the nightly drag show. Club owner Roman Kochagov told Reuters that on any given night, only a third of his customers are gay men, far fewer than when he opened the club nine years ago. He says that it's a myth that there's still a gay community left in Sochi. VIDEO Scroll down for video . The last bar in town: Mayak Cabaret is one of the last vestiges of the gay community in Sochi, Russia . Gone: The gay community in Sochi has mostly fled the seaside resort since President Putin has cracked down on homosexuality in the country. Above, a woman walks past the anonymous exterior of the club . No one left: Most of the customers at the club these days  are straight couples who come to watch the nightly drag show . 'The number of gays has dropped for years. Ever year there have been fewer and fewer...now they have almost all disappeared,' he said, adding that he himself is looking to leave the country. Sochi's gay scene has been shrinking since Russia won the right to host the 2014 Winter Games, and the decline has continued since President Vladimir Putin signed a law this year banning the spread of 'gay propaganda' among minors. The new law has focused attention on Sochi, which will host many foreigners as well as Russians during the Olympics. Some gay activists question its legality and others have called for a boycott of the Games in protest. Many members of the city's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community have left the country. They worry Sochi's reputation as a city of tolerance will decline further. Putin's increasingly conservative social agenda in his third term as president has boosted the role of the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader has suggested homosexuality is one of Russia's biggest threats, and given more air time to anti-homosexual rhetoric on media outlets. Outlawing homosexuality: In his third term as president, Vladimir Putin has become increasingly conservative, making the views of the Russian Orthodox Church the law of the land. Above, Putin at his annual press conference yesterday . Kochagov and his partner Andrei Tanichev opened Mayak in a darkly lit one-story building on a promenade overlooking the Black Sea. They had finished a successful run with a gay hotel and wanted to try something more ambitious. The building housing the Mayak Cabaret has only one outside light, shining over a brown steel door and doorbell. Except for the music that it pumps out after 10:00 p.m. every evening, it is barely recognizable as a club. Youths who have learned it is a gay club have ripped the sign off so many times, Kochagov said, that he has stopped putting it back up. Fights sometimes break out between his customers and clients of a working-class bar next door, but the level of violence barely compares with what high school student Vladislav Slavsky says he puts up with on a regular basis. His club: Mayak's co-owner Andrey Tanichev poses for a photograph in his venue. He and Roman Kochagov started the club after opening up a successful gay hotel . Losing customers: On any given night, Kochagov says only a third of his customers are gay men. Many straight couples turn out to watch the nightly drag show. Above, a performer gets ready back stage . Sochi's past: The resort town on the Black Sea became known as a more liberal-minded city during Soviet times. Gay men knew of it as a place to cruise for flings on the beach . At Mayak they employ singers and . dancers - all men - and Kochagov says he draws a profit every night from . crowds among the city's well-heeled who prefer to avoid the resort's . tourist bars. By Russian standards, the city has a marked liberal feel. 'People . here don't care who I sleep with. I walk down the street with my . boyfriend, people may know I'm gay, but no one pays any attention,' said . Marcel Aflin, 30, who worked in the northern oil city of Salekhard to . earn money to come and enjoy the sun and the beach of Sochi. But . Sochi is much less tolerant than many Western European cities. Many in . Sochi's gay community have left, lured abroad by the gay scenes in . cities such as Berlin or Barcelona. During . Soviet times, Sochi had gained a reputation for tolerance, especially . after it became a top tourism spot at a time when Soviet regulations . stipulated that husbands and wives must vacation away from each other . and their children. The city became the background for many summertime romances among married and unmarried people. Health . spa regulations also demanded that visitors were divided by sex and . that strangers were put up in the same room during their stay in the . region. Homosexuality, . which was a crime in the Soviet Union, was decriminalized only in 1993. By the time the Soviet Union crumbled, however, Sochi's beaches had . earned a reputation as a place for gay men to pick up partners. The future: Many in Russia are still unsure what the new gay propaganda law will mean for the LGBT community in the country - but fear it will lead to violence . What to do? Putin's gay propaganda law has become a point of issue with many countries sending athletes to Russia for the Winter Olympics. Above, a man strips onstage during a performance at Mayak . 'Many, many gay men know about it and went there,' said David Tuller, who wrote a book about gay life in Russia which was published in 1996. 'It always had a reputation as a city where you could go and cruise on the beach,' he said. Now locals say they can feel Putin's increasingly conservative political course, which has galvanized his support among more traditional parts of the country. The nationwide bill that outlaws gay 'propaganda' gives little detail on what exactly is banned and gay activists fear the possible proximity of children could be used to ban gay rights rally or even punish displays of affection. Response: Ice skater Brian Boitano came out this week ahead of his trip to Sochi as a part of the U.S. delegation. He was the third American to make such a public statement in recent days . Holding hands or kissing a same-sex partner in public, they say, might be enough to be hit with a fine equivalent to $170. Russian lawmakers say the law is a reflection of the country's social mores, and that it is needed to protect minors. Putin has condemned gay unions for failing to produce children as Russia battles a demographic crisis. But the legislation has brought calls for a boycott of the Olympics from activists such as British comedian Stephen Fry, who visited Russia this year to draw attention to the bill. Gay activists have also asked International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach to launch an investigation into the Russian law and the implications it would hold for visitors during the Olympics. Protest Sochi: Some, like British comedian Stehpeh Fry, said the games should be boycotted to protest Putin's new law. Gay rights activist Vladislav Slavsky (right) poses with his unidentified boyfriend on Sochi's Black Sea promenade . Russia's sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said this month that the government should have waited until after the Games to implement the law banning gay propaganda. 'It would have been possible to calculate what kind of reaction this would have caused in the West, especially on the eve of the Olympics,' he said in an interview with business daily RBK. In an attempt to burnish Russia's image ahead of the Games, Putin has warned Russians against homophobia and said gay people would be welcome in Sochi during the Olympics. Many in Russia's gay community say the law sends out a signal for people to single them out for discrimination and in some cases violence.","Mayak Caberet is one of the last gay bars left in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi, Russia which will host the 2014 Winter Olympics .

"By . Stephen Wright . and John Stevens . Updated: . 11:48 EST, 28 February 2012 . His rise from DIY store worker to international playboy with a £250million fortune is the stuff of dreams. A few years after quitting his £5,000-a-year job as a cashier for Wickes, James Ibori had become one of Nigeria's most influential and richest politicians. He wasted no time spending his new-found wealth on luxury homes, top-of-the-range cars, five-star travel and fees at exclusive boarding schools. Playboy lifestyle: Former Wickes cashier James Ibori, 49, has admitted a fraud totalling more than £50million which he committed while a former Nigerian state governor . But yesterday the 49-year-old stood . shame-faced in the dock of London's Southwark Court as he admitted . stealing tens of millions of pounds from the oil-rich state he governed . in Nigeria. Scotland Yard detectives believe his fraud could exceed . £250million. He was on trial in the UK because much of the stolen money was laundered through his London office. Ibori moved from Nigeria to West . London in the late 1980s and was found guilty of stealing goods from the . Wickes store he worked at in Ruislip in 1990. A year later he was . convicted of handling a stolen credit card. He moved back to Nigeria and worked for its president, Sani Abacha, as a policy consultant. Rising quickly through the ranks of . the ruling People's Democratic Party, he was voted governor of Delta . State in 1999, winning re-election four years later. In power, he systematically stole from . the public purse, taking kickbacks and transferring state funds to his . own bank accounts around the world. Luxury: Exclusive home that Ibori bought in Hampstead, north London,  with £2.2million in cash in 2001 . He was helped by family members, . including his wife Theresa, sister Christine Ibori-Ibie, his mistress . Udoamaka Oniugbo, and Mayfair lawyer Bhadresh Gohil. A massive police investigation into . Ibori's activities revealed he had bought six properties in London, . including a six-bedroom house with indoor pool in Hampstead for . £2.2million and a flat opposite the nearby Abbey Road recording studios. There was also a property in Dorset, a £3.2million mansion in South Africa and further real estate in Nigeria. Extravagant: Ibori, 49, owned an apartment in this block on Abbey Road, London, opposite the famous music studios . Fleet of cars: The former Nigerian state governor owned a number of cars including this Bentley Continental worth in the region of £150,000 . He owned a fleet of armoured Range . Rovers costing £600,000 and a £120,000 Bentley. On one of his trips to . London he bought a Mercedes Maybach for more than £300,000 at a dealer . on Park Lane and immediately shipped it to South Africa. He bought a private jet for . £12million, spent £126,000 a month on his credit cards and ran up a . £15,000 bill for a two-day stay at the Lanesborough hotel in London. Prosecutor Sasha Wass told the court . Ibori concealed his UK criminal record, which would have excluded him . from office in Nigeria. Extraordinary extravagance: Ibori owned a fleet of armoured Range Rovers - including this one - bought with the proceeds of his £50million fraud . Large home: James Ibori's home in Abuja, Nigeria. Today he was facing a jail sentence after admitting a £50million fraud . 'He was never the legitimate governor . and there was effectively a thief in government house,' Miss Wass said. 'As the pretender of that public office, he was able to plunder Delta . State's wealth and hand out patronage.' The court heard Ibori abused his position to award contracts to his associates including his sister and his mistress. Scotland Yard began its investigation . into Ibori after officers found two computer hard drives in his London . office that revealed his criminality. Fraudsters: Solicitor Bhadresh Gohil (left) and Ibori's wife Theresa (right) who have already been convicted of money laundering in the scam . Convicted: Ibori's sister Christine Ibori-Idie (left) and his mistress Udoamaka Oniugbo (right) have also been found guilty of money laundering . He was arrested by the Nigerian . Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in December 2007, but two years . later a court in his home town, Asaba, dismissed the charges saying . there was not enough evidence. When the case was reopened by Nigerian . authorities in April 2010, Ibori fled to Dubai where he was detained at . the request of the Metropolitan Police and extradited to the UK last . April. In a packed courtroom Ibori, dressed . in a dark grey suit and black shirt, appeared in the dock to enter ten . guilty pleas to fraud, money laundering and conspiracy on what was due . to be the first day of a 12-week trial. Luxury: Homes he owned in Lagos, Nigeria, and Kenton, north-west London . Homes: An apartment owned by Ibori's sister Christine Ibori-Ibie in Brent, north-west London (left) and a London property (right) owned by his mistress Udoamaka Onuigbo . His wife, his mistress and his sister . were all jailed for five years each for money laundering offences . following earlier trials. Last March, Gohil, 46, and described as Ibori's London-based lawyer, was jailed for seven years for his role in the scam. Attempts will be made to confiscate as much of Ibori's money and assets as possible so that they can be returned to Nigeria. The Met's Detective Inspector Paul .

"By . Reuters . An Illinois judge on Friday ordered a disobedient patient with infectious tuberculosis to wear an ankle bracelet and stay home alone or be taken into custody. Christian Mbemba Ibanda, who is in his 20s, of Champaign, Illinois, failed to appear at a hearing for which Judge Chase Leonhard and his entire courtroom had been fitted with protective masks to guard against the highly contagious disease. In Ibanda's absence the masks were not worn in the courtroom, but were taken along by a team of officials who headed out to Ibanda's apartment to carry out the judge's order. One team member, Champaign-Urbana Public Health District Administrator Julie Pryde, who sought the order, said Ibanda refused to come to the hearing and told her he was staying home.

Carrie Storrs, Illinois Department of Public Health, left, instructs Champaign County court reporter Melissa Clagg, with her disposable respirator prior to Friday's hearing . But when the team arrived at Ibanda's apartment in Champaign, about 140 miles south of Chicago, it was vacant. Pryde slapped a sign on the door reading 'Quarantine. Contagious Disease. Keep Out.' She said the team would keep searching for him. Ibanda was diagnosed in March with active pulmonary tuberculosis, and was ordered to stay home on his own and await a nurse's daily visit to administer medication, Pryde said. 'We go and he's not there,' she said before the hearing. On previous occasions, when health workers contacted Ibanda by phone, he had said he was out shopping and 'basically told us he has things to do,' Pryde said. Another time, he was found to be home with a woman and a 5-year-old girl, both sleeping in the house and neither wearing masks, she said. Pulmonary tuberclosis, which Ibanda has, responds to drug therapy. If treated, it's possible he could be noninfectious in five weeks and cured in 6 months to a year . Ibanda was not immediately reachable for comment. Pryde said it was not immediately clear whether Ibanda would face consequences for failing to show up at Friday's proceeding. Tuberculosis is a highly contagious, potentially deadly disease with symptoms including night sweats and extreme exhaustion and is spread through sneezing or coughing. Unlike some forms of multi-drug resistant TB, active pulmonary tuberculosis responds to drug therapy. If Ibanda was compliant, he could be rendered noninfectious in five weeks and cured in six months to a year, Pryde said. It is not known how Ibanda contracted the disease. In a similar case in 2009, another Champaign TB patient was in court-ordered isolation for about six weeks and, after a year of therapy, he was cured of TB, Pryde said.","Christian Mbemba Ibanda failed to appear at a hearing on Friday .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The latest victory in the battle of the handsets goes to Samsung as test show its touchscreens are superior to those found on handsets made by rival Apple. Finnish firm OptoFidelty has found that while the touchscreen on the Samsung Galaxy S3 only lost accuracy along the edges, but Apple's iPhone 5S and 5C were inaccurate across 75 per cent of their respective screens. Researchers measured the screen accuracy on all three devices to within one millimetre using a robot with an artificial finger. Scroll down for video . OptoFidelty measured accuracy by tapping the phones and comparing the touch position with reported coordinates. Passes are shown in green and fails are shown in red. Samsung's Galaxy S3, right, lost accuracy at the edge of its display, whereas the iPhone 5S and 5C lost accuracy in 75 per cent of cases . Apple's iPhone 5S, pictured, had a 25 per cent accuracy . The iPhone 5C, pictured, had a similar accuracy score to the 5S . Samsung's Galaxy S3, pictured, only lost accuracy at the edges . OptoFidelity used its Touch Panel Performance Tester (TPPT) to measure the accuracy of the touch panels on each phone. The TPPT is fitted with artificial fingers. It presses the 'fingers' onto the screen and records the coordinates, to within one millimetre. This creates a pass or fail score where passes are shown in . green and fails are shown in red. OptoFidelty performed the first accuracy measurement by tapping the phones and comparing the actual touch position with reported coordinates. This created a pass or fail score, limited to plus or minus one millimetre. Passes were shown in green and fails were shown in red. The accuracy of each screen was then plotted using these markers. Researchers then used the robot, called the OptoFidelity Touch Panel Performance Tester (TPPT) to simulate typing on each device along the QWERTY keys. By using the robot, the researchers were able to accurately track the co-ordinates of the artificial screen in relation to the coordinates of the screen. Samsung's Galaxy S3 only lost accuracy along the side and top edges. This . bezel is deliberately added to phones to prevent fingers accidentally . clicking links, opening apps or swiping pages in a book accidentally. OptoFidelity used a robot called the Touch Panel Performance Tester (TPPT) to simulate typing on each device along the keys on the keyboard. This image shows the typing accuracy of the Galaxy S3, which only lost accuracy at the edges (shown in red) By comparison, typing on the Apple iPhone 5S was less accurate than the Galaxy S3. This image shows that the keyboard lost accuracy along the edges and in as far as the E key on the left, and the letter I on the right, pictured . Both Apple devices had a high level of accuracy in the bottom left of the screen, but were less accurate elsewhere. By comparing coordinates, OptoFidelty was able to work out that Apple's phones were only accurate across 25 per cent of their screens, meaning they were inaccurate in 75 per cent of cases. This could explain why, on occasions, typos can be difficult to correct or why clicking on a specific link can take several attempts. 'Because the touch accuracy is more even in Galaxy S3 than in iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C, you get fewer typing errors, and letters which are close to the edge are working better,' said a spokesman for OptoFidelity. 'You can also test this by tapping letters on the edge and typing long text messages.' During . the typing tests, Samsung again only lost accuracy on the very edge of . the keyboard, while Apple's keyboard lost accuracy inwards to the E on the left and the letter I on the opposite side of the board. The Touch Panel Performance Tester (TPPT), pictured, is fitted with artificial fingers. It presses the 'fingers' onto the screen and records the coordinates, to within one millimetre . The researchers concluded: 'Today when mobile devices are getting more and more sophisticated, user actions with device are expanding user experience and the quality of device are becoming major differentiators in mobile business. 'By reliably testing touch accuracy, latency, scroll performance or other features that strongly affect the real end user experience mobile and touch device manufacturers can achieve real market benefits without sacrificing user experience.'","The touchscreen of Samsung's Galaxy S3 was compared to the iPhone 5S .

"By . Alexandra Williams . Formula One legend Michael Schumacher is showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening', his manager has revealed. After more than three months in a coma, the seven-time champion is 'making progress'. He has opened his eyes and has had interaction with his environment, albeit in a minimal way so far. New hope: Schumacher's manager has said the F1 driver has shown 'encouraging signs' of improvement . Schumacher, 45, suffered a near-fatal head injury in a skiing accident in Meribel, France, on December 29. In . the first positive news for months, his manager Sabine Kehm announced: . 'Michael is making progress on his way. He shows moments of . consciousness and awakening. We are on his side during his long and . difficult fight, together with the team of the hospital in Grenoble, and . we keep remaining confident.' She . said no further details would be given out of respect to his family and . to 'enable the medical team to work in full calmness'. Gary Hartstein, a former Formula One doctor, said 'awakening' would mean that Schumacher has opened his eyes. He . said: 'This eye opening can even be cyclic, following what looks just . like a sleep-wake cycle (even if not synchronised to real day-night . hours).' And he said the 'moments of consciousness' meant that Schumacher would have had interaction with his environment. He . said: 'It consists of episodes of clear, purposeful interaction with . the environment, and/or clear signs of awareness of self, even if these . signs are not constantly present. Bring him home: Reports says Corinna plans to build a multi-million pound facility so Michael can leave hospital . The Â£25 million estate on the shores of Lake Geneva, where Corinna Schumacher is installing the facility . 'For . example, if Michael smiles when a member of his entourage talks to him - . reproducibly and consistently on at least a few occasions. Or following . people with his eyes. 'Or trying to communicate, or obeying simple . commands. Any of this constitutes objective signs of contact between the . ""outside"" and the ""inside"". This then would be a minimally conscious . state. And that is about the best news we could possibly get right now.' But despite the encouraging signs, Schumacher will not be moved from Grenoble Hospital anytime soon. His . family and friends have also stressed there is no truth in wild rumours . that his wife Corinna 'has built or plans to build any kind of medical . suite for Michael on any of the buildings on their land in Gland, . Switzerland. This includes future buildings'. When doctors give the go-ahead he will be moved to a rehabilitation clinic, according to a family friend. The friend said: 'There will be a very significant amount of rehab required.' Doctors began the process of gradually awakening Schumacher from his coma more than nine weeks ago. Keen skier: Thrill-seeker Schumacher has always been keen and skilled skier . Waiting: The Grenoble University Hospital, where Schumacher's been in a coma for three months . Loving support: Corinna arrives at the hospital to which she and family make a daily 150-mile round trip . It . will be 14 weeks ago on Sunday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his . life-threatening accident while skiing in Meribel, where he owns a . chalet. Doctors began the process of gradually awakening him more than nine weeks ago. Ms . Kehm said it is 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the . racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a . 'banal situation'. The accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in an off-piste area in the French resort of Meribel. He . was skiing with his 14-year-old son when he lost control after hitting a . rock. He ended up smashing his head into a bolder 34 feet further down . the mountain. He is receiving round-the-clock care in intensive care in Grenoble University Hospital. Corinna, with whom he has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. They have remained confident throughout the tragedy that Schumacher will recover. A . statement released last month said: 'We are and remain confident that . Michael will pull through and will wake up. There sometimes are small, . encouraging signs, but we also know that this is the time to be very . patient.' His manager has . stood by this statement during the last few weeks amidst the negativity . offered by certain doctors who have nothing to do with his treatment. In February French investigators closed the official inquiry into his accident, ruling out any criminal wrongdoing.","He has shown 'moments of consciousness' it has been reported .

"By . Sam Webb . A mysterious beast that has been attacking cattle has been killed on a farm in Belarus, baffling people living nearby and the local vet with its bizarre appearance. This freakish monstrosity, which some cynics might say looks a lot like a normal woodland animal, had been attacking cows and calves by savagely biting their feet, drawing parallels to the Chupacabra of Latin American legend. The vet is at a loss as to what the creature is, claiming two similar creatures have been spotted in the region, but they both managed to evade their pursuers by melting into the forests like supernatural beings. Or small woodland animals, which the body closely resembles. Is this monstrous beast, killed by a Belorussian farmhand, the legendary chupacabra or is there a more pedestrian explanation? We may never know... The region's hunters are also at a loss. Some of them believe it is a mutant amalgam of a number of species because it resembles a hyena, has the features of a fox, a raccoon and a dog, reports English Russia. The vet described it as a 'sensation' and vowed to burn the corpse of the killed animal. Presumably in case it comes back to life. But an earlier discovery may be the key to unlocking this mystery. A Ukrainian farmer killed a similar animal last year and gave the body of the animal to biologists. Speculation was rife about the creature, with some claiming that it could be a 'mutant' fox poisoned by radiation, while another theory was that it was a hybrid originating from a secret Soviet plant conducting tests on animals relating to chemical or biological weapons development. A fox mutated by radiation? Or the by-product of a sinister Soviet experiment. No, according to Ukrainian scientists, it's a raccoon dog . The biologists, however, pointed out it was a raccoon dog, which were be bred on Soviet farms in 1939, but were released into the wild when the Second World War started. The Chupacabra is a Latin American monster that attacks livestock, usually goats, and drinks their blood. The name itself is derived from the Spanish 'chupar' ('to suck') and 'cabra' ('goat'). Descriptions of them vary from reptilian with spikes or quills on its back to hairless dogs with fangs and claws. Someone in Piedmont, North Carolina, sent this picture of a mangy dog-like creature into a local TV station with the caption: 'Chupacabra's do exist' Since the legend of the mythical Mexican predator first emerged, there have been 'sightings' of the Chupacabra all over the world. One of these took place earlier this week in Piedmont, North Carolina, after a local spotted a mangy, fox-like creature fitting with the description bestowed on the 'goat-sucker' or 'devil-dog'. A picture was taken by a woman called Ramona who sent it into a local news site with the caption, 'Chupacabras do exist! Scientists have speculated that the creatures could be coyotes infected by parasites after one animal was discovered last July following a fatal attack on livestock. The first reported sighting was in 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Their mysterious deaths supposedly spawned the legend of the chupacabra in Latin America. Months later, the creature was allegedly spotted in CanÃ³vanas, where as many as 150 animals had been killed. Since then, there have been attacks allegedly carried out by the creature across South and Central America, and even into New Mexico and Texas.","Terrified locals say mystery surrounds creature, which had attacked cattle .

"By . Roger Dobson . A knitted patch made from drip-dry shirt material is being used to treat one of the most common causes of chronic pain. The polyester implant has transformed repairs to torn shoulder  tendons. The patch is stitched in place over the rotator cuff, the muscle that allows the arm to raise. Once in place, the patient’s own tissue grows in and around the patch to seal it permanently in place, and also to prevent any more tears. Invented by consultant orthopaedic surgeon Roger Hackney, a former Olympic steeplechaser, the 40-minute operation has been carried out on about 50 patients with very large tears – alleviating pain and restoring movement. Mr Hackney, who reached the  final of the 3,000m at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, explains: ‘What to do with these patients was an unsolved surgical problem. It was awful having to tell them there was nothing else we could offer when they had lost the use of the shoulder, and were in severe pain. ‘These patients have considerable problems. They could not put their arm over their head, they had a shoulder that didn’t work, were in pain, particularly at night, and it affected their quality of life and their working life.’ He teamed up with Leeds-based Neoligaments, part of the medical device company Xiros, to develop and produce the patch. Shoulder pain affects up to a quarter of adults at some time, with about 70 per cent due to rotator- cuff tears. Roger Hackney (left, 104) has invented the novel implant. The orthopedic surgeon is also a former Olympian . Prevalence increases with age, rising to three-quarters of the over-70s, although in many cases it does not result in serious symptoms. The shoulder joint is a ball-and-shallow-socket assembly and is covered by the rotator cuff, a group of four muscles and their tendons which keep the joint stable and drive shoulder movement. Most rotator-cuff tears are caused by repetitive overhead arm movement. Swimming, weightlifting, painting or window-cleaning can also increase the likelihood of shoulder pain associated with poor rotator-cuff function. The tear is a coming away of the attachment of the tendon to the bone of the top end of the arm. It can also be caused by trauma, such as a fall or dislocation. Symptoms of a tear include significant pain at night, with an inability to lie on the affected side, loss  of overhead movement, muscle weakness, and difficulty dressing and undressing. Where the tear is relatively small – less than 3cm – it can be surgically repaired by bringing the tendon to the bone, then stitching and anchoring the soft tissue of the cuff in place. But sometimes the tear is simply too large and stiff and cannot be stretched to the bone, making bigger tear repairs difficult. Those greater than 5cm in diameter are not always repairable and gaps are left, leading to the tear returning with time. An added complication is that with advancing age, the tendons and muscles can deteriorate, making them unsuitable for stretching and stitching. Mr Hackney, consultant surgeon at Leeds General Infirmary and Honorary Senior Lecturer at the University of Leeds, came up with the idea of the patch after being unable to offer a suitable treatment to his patients. The patch he developed is a woven polyester fabric. It is implanted using open surgery and a general anaesthetic, and is stitched into place over a repair of the torn rotator cuff. Shoulder pain affects up to a quarter of adults at some time, with about 70 per cent due to rotator-cuff tears . Once in place, the patch, which comes in three sizes from 3cm to 5cm, reinforces the tissue and prevents future tears. It also reduces the load on the tissue. A key design feature is that its structure encourages the growth of the patient’s own tissue into the patch material. Early data shows that the patch, which has now been approved for use in the UK and Europe, has been particularly successful in patients whose tendon tears have recurred after a normal repair, and in patients where a normal repair is not possible because the tendon is too stiff and the muscle wasted. Lee Richardson, a Leeds-based joiner and builder, had a patch implanted in his right shoulder  and is now waiting for surgery on his left. ‘I had a tear on the right side and it was very painful, especially when  I lifted my arm above my head,’ says Lee, 48. 'After the patch was put on, the pain pretty much went away. I get the occasional twinge with movement, but considering that the  tear was 5cm long, that’s pretty good. I was very pleased with  the outcome. ‘I think the problem began when I fell over playing football years ago, but with age it got worse. ‘The work involved in my job didn’t help either. The left shoulder has now gone, and I am waiting for a date for the next surgery.’","Knitted patch implant made from polyester used to treat chronic pain .

"By . Louise Eccles . , IN SLOMCZYN, POLAND . Languishing in filthy conditions with little food or water, puppies bred on a Polish farm face a long and arduous journey. Their destination? The UK, where they will be sold at a huge profit to unsuspecting dog-lovers who have no idea where they came from. The cruel trade is booming after Britain relaxed import rules two years ago to meet EU guidelines. Since then, thousands of dogs have been brought into the country from Eastern Europe, many in poor health and with no vaccinations. Scroll down for video .

Cheap, but not so cheerful: Puppy trader Jacek tries to sell Labrador puppies to Mail writer Louise Eccles . The Daily Mail accompanied animal welfare charity Four Paws as officials confiscated 12 dogs on a filthy small-scale farm in the Lipno district of rural Poland. Two German shepherd puppies were found lying in the basement of a dark and filthy outbuilding. Their only food was rotten pig’s intestines, which lay stinking on the damp concrete floor. The breeding dogs also included cocker spaniels, with bleeding ears and matted calloused paws. Julie Sanders, Four Paws UK country manager, said breeders were selling their pedigree puppies at Polish markets for less than £100 to unscrupulous dealers. Once in Britain, they can fetch up to £850. ‘The puppies are often badly treated and in poor health,’ said Miss Saunders. ‘Some are as young as four weeks old when sold, far younger than the legal limit of  15 weeks. ‘Taken too young from their mothers, they are transported hundreds of miles to reach the UK. This is organised international crime with a network of people making a profit at every stage.’ Breeding machine: A German Shepherd bitch found lying in squalor with her days-old puppy during a raid carried out by a Polish animal charity on an illicit puppy farm in the Lipno district of rural northern Poland .

Sad eyes: The puppy is carried to safety in the arms of Julie Sanders, Four Paws UK Country Manager, who said breeders were selling their pedigree puppies to unscrupulous dealers at Polish markets for under £100 . Britain relaxed its pet passport scheme in 2012, meaning pet owners no longer needed to wait six months after a rabies vaccination before entering the country. The change triggered a surge in the number of puppies being brought over for sale from Eastern Europe. Between 2011 and 2012, imports to the UK rose 1,150 per cent from Romania, 450 per cent from Hungary, 507 per cent from Lithuania and 183 per cent from Poland. Under the rules, five puppies can be brought in per person for non-commercial purposes. But many dealers bring them in en masse. Others enter with forged vaccination documents – putting Britain at risk of rabies. Frightened: The mother of the German shepherd pup hides in the barn where they were kept . Compassion: Birgitt Thiesman from animal charity Pogotowie Dlazwiezat carries a puppy to safety. Right, Ms Sanders from Four Paws UK, who said the animals can fetch as much as £850 on the British market . At a puppy market in Słomczyn, central Poland, the Mail spoke to Mathius, a burly trader with two dachshunds tucked into his jacket. Standing next to cots, cages and cardboard boxes full of thoroughbreds, he smirked as he boasted of how easy it is to import dogs into Britain.‘We sell to the UK all the time,’  he said. ‘What kind of puppies do you want? French bulldogs, chihuahuas? It is not a problem.’ At . the same market, a man called Roman was offering to sell a miniature . pinscher for £200, saying it was the last of his litter. Holding the shaking ‘handbag dog’, the . middle-aged man said the fur on the puppy’s head would grow back ‘once . it is in the daylight’. ‘It has been living in the dark, indoors, so the hair does not grow,’ he added. Holding the puppy in one hand, he told the Mail: ‘This is a very good price. My daughter lived in Scotland and these dogs are 3,000 zloty there (£600). This is much cheaper than the UK.’ Caged: German Shepherd stud dogs wait in their kennels to be taken away by the animal charity and rehomed .

She would have been used for breeding. Hope: Cocker spaniels were found on the farm with bleeding ears and matted calloused paws . Once in Britain, the Eastern European dealers sell the puppies either over the internet or on to UK traders who pick them up from petrol stations or car parks near the ports or motorways. The British dealers then sell the animals on from their own homes, pretending they are home-bred. According to Government figures, the number of dogs which entered from Poland, Romania, Hungary and Lithuania rose from 2,000 to 12,000 between 2011 and 2013. Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for London’s Poplar and Limehouse, raised the startling statistics in Parliament last month. He said: ‘The rules regarding the importation of dogs appear to be completely useless when you look at the huge number of animals which are coming into the UK. 'None of them, not a single one, was supposedly brought in for commercial purposes. It defies belief. 'Many people are then buying these puppies in Britain mistakenly, in the belief they have the appropriate paperwork, when it is either forged or incomplete.’ Chained up: A husky that has been cruelly treated at a farm in Gosciesewo pictured during a raid to rescue dogs there. Right, a man from the animal charity carries the dog away to be treated and rehomed . Mistreated: The poorly treated animal is blind in one eye and very thin . Animal charities have warned Britain is at risk of rabies, a disease the country has been free from since 1922. David Bowles, of the RSPCA, said: ‘We have a big dog population in the UK and are a nation of pet owners. ‘The criminal gangs have realised it is a good market and they can make quick money here. ‘The puppy farms we have seen in Hungary have been horrific, with very little daylight. ‘They are kept as breeding machines to churn out puppies and then transported in a transit van across Europe. The chances of getting caught are very low.’ But he warned that pet owners  risk being landed with a large bill if they accidentally buy a dog with no vaccinations from a puppy farm. ‘A lot of these animals are suffering from terrible diseases such  as parvovirus, leishmaniasis, and echinococcus, which are prevalent in these countries in Eastern Europe,’ he said. ‘The owners are also taking a risk. If they take their dog to be registered with a vet and the vet finds the dog has not been micro-chipped or vaccinated then the dog will have to go into quarantine for six months and the owner will have to pay for that. ‘It is never worth trying to get a bargain basement puppy – for the animal or the owner.’","Cruel trade booming since Europe forced Britain to relax import controls .

"By . Katie Nicholl . He has been the star of the Royal Tour Down Under so far, but Prince George may soon have to share the spotlight with a sibling, according to the Duke of Cambridge. In an unguarded comment on a walkabout in the small New Zealand town of Cambridge, William dropped the biggest hint yet that he and Kate plan to extend their family. On day six of their tour, they braved drizzly conditions to greet well-wishers including Briton Cynthia Read, who was commissioned by the New Zealand government to make a merino wool shawl for George. The Duke thanked Mrs Read for the gift before telling her: ‘You might have to make another one soon!’ Scroll down for video . In an unguarded comment, Prince William, left, hinted to Cynthia Read, right, he may be expecting another child. Mrs Read had made a woolen shawl for baby George . The Duchess of Cambridge greeted five-year-old, Mataawhio Matahaere-vieint, with a traditional Maori greeting, before the little girl asked if she could give Kate a hug . The look of love: Kate stares adoringly at William as rumours abound that the couple could be expecting their second child . Mrs Read, who emigrated from Newcastle-upon-Tyne eight years ago with her husband Ken, said: ‘The way William said it was like he was  letting me in on a secret.’ Given her history of severe morning sickness – Kate spent three days in hospital while carrying George – it is likely the Duchess would be advised not to fly or undertake an arduous tour while in the early stages of a second pregnancy. However, Royal insiders point out that George was conceived just weeks after the couple returned from their Far East tour in September 2012, and it is possible they plan to start trying for another child once they have finished this trip. William and Kate arrived in Dunedin this morning as their tour of New Zealand continues. Despite their hectic schedule the couple seem to be enjoying themselves . Kate positions her hands over her stomach. After her husband recently hinted that they may be expecting a second child, this could be seen as another sign . Certainly baby talk has dominated the tour, with eight-month-old George enjoying the same star billing as his parents – although he apparently refuses to eat his greens. The Duchess yesterday revealed she ‘had to mash up’ her son’s vegetables to  disguise them. William and Kate’s decision to take George with them has given the world its first proper chance to see the Duchess as a busy mother. But it’s clear from the compassion she has demonstrated with other children that her maternal feelings extend beyond her own family. She melted hearts at the Rainbow Place . Children’s Hospice in nearby Hamilton . where she met Bailey Rupe, whose mother has terminal cancer. The . Duchess sat down with Bailey, six, and asked: ‘How is mummy doing? Do . you find it difficult sometimes? I’m sure you do but you’re a very brave . girl.’ As The Mail on Sunday revealed last week the Duchess is on a crusade to turn the international spotlight on palliative care for sick children, so her hour-long visit to the Rainbow Centre was a crucial engagement in her tour diary. She has also been asked to become patron of a new hospice, Hummingbird House, which due to open in Queensland, Australia, this year. During their trip to Hamilton, the couple also officially opened the National Cycling Centre at the Avantidrome. William played the role of starter for a race and grimaced as he fired a pistol to get the event under way. Tomorrow the couple will spend their first night away from George and fly to Dunedin for a church service before attending a rugby match. From Dunedin they will fly to Queenstown for a wine-tasting session at the Amisfield Winery, and enjoy a thrilling jet boat ride on the Shotover River. The couple have worked their magic throughout the trip, prompting New Zealand’s Olympic gold medal rower Hamish Bond to say in Hamilton: ‘We can relate to them and they can relate to us. They represent a new era of Royals.’ In demand: The Duchess acknowledges the crowds yesterday and bends down to listen to a well-wisher's soft toy .

"By . James  Nye . The musician who police suspect supplied the heroin that killed Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman has said he feels like he has been made a scapegoat for his death. Speaking to the New York Times against the advice of his lawyer, Robert Aaron, 57, said that a witch hunt is going on because authorities are under pressure to prosecute someone for Hoffman's death in early February. Labeling himself a 'human sacrifice', the multi-instrumentalist who has played with David Bowie and Wycleff Jean said that he is 'unlucky' to have been singled out by police. Scapegoat? Robert Vineberg stares at a camera during his arraignment in court in New York February 5, 2014 - three days after Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead in his West Village home from a drugs overdose . Canadian-born Aaron, who faces up to 25-years if he is found guilty of possession and supplying heroin to the tragic actor, was the subject of a sympathetic report in which he revealed his battles with the drug. Outlining an on-off habit for the best part of 40-years, Aaron said that he will not apologize for his drug use as no one has been hurt by it. 'Honestly, I don’t think anybody I know romanticized it as much as they liked it. It’s got good qualities,' said Aaron to The New York Times. Arrested in his Manhattan apartment two nights after Hoffman was discovered in his West Village home with a needle sticking out of his arm, Aaron was taken into custody after police found nearly 300 bags of heroin. Last photograph: Philip Seymour Hoffman poses for a portrait at The Collective and Gibson Lounge Powered by CEG, during the Sundance Film Festival, in Park City, Utah in January . Aaron said that the majority were for personal use and explained why he continues to call himself a drug addict. 'A lot of times you have a deadline and you have to work for 24 hours. This lets you do it with no pain, no tiredness…,' said Aaron. 'If I have to write a book, get me high — I’ll have the book written in two weeks. You’re lucid. And emotions don’t affect you as much — your anger — it bottles up your feelings. 'It makes you more rational, or you think you are, anyway. You sleep wonderfully. I’m a lifelong insomniac.' Aaron denies he sold the drug as a dealer to Hoffman - although he admits he would occasionally sell drugs to his friends. 'I was my own best customer. I always say, a monkey can’t sell bananas.' said Aaron. Busted: Aaron was arrested in his Mott Street apartment two nights after Hoffman's death. Police found nearly 300 bags of heroin in his possession . His friends told The New York Times he was a consummate professional, and someone whose habit has never affected his work. In discussing Hoffman, who Aaron claims to have known for a little over a year before the actor's death, he says that the two would speak about their drug use. 'People make choices in life, and they should be allowed to do whatever they want. And if that’s his choice, I’m really sad but I respect his choice,' said Aaron. 'He was an adult. He’d been doing it a while, he knew what he was up against. Nobody killed him. 'If you’re looking for the person who killed him, you know who it was. Him. Nobody else. It’s really sad, though. And more horrible is the way he’s portrayed in death. Who needs that?' Indeed, while the NYPD told the press that they were acting on a tip that Aaron supplied drugs to Hoffman - that actor has not featured in his indictment. And last month, a judge denied Aaron's request that he undergo treatment instead of serving jail time.","Robert Aaron claims that he is being unfairly blamed for the drugs overdose of Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman in February .

"By . Reuters . and Alexandra Klausner . An 11-year-old boy in North Carolina died after being struck in the head by a baseball hit off a bat during practice at his school, a local official said on Saturday. Alex Newsome, a sixth grader at Roland-Grise Middle School in Wilmington, North Carolina, was hit by a line drive on Friday and died hours later, Valita Quattlebaum, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County Schools, said in a statement. Star News Online reports that Alex Newsome, a left handed pitcher was throwing at batting practice when he was hit. He had been pitching from behind a protective screen but he leaned slightly out of the net. Alex Newsome died on Saturday after being hit in the ball with a baseball as he was pitching . Coach Michael Titzel and assistant coach Dereck Boone performed CPR until paramedics arrived and the boy died at New Hanover Regional Medical Center at around 9:20 p.m. 'New Hanover County Schools is greatly saddened by the loss of our student in this tragic incident,' Quattlebaum said. 'Staff, coaches, parents, the principal and superintendent of the district were all at the hospital after the accident to offer support to the family, classmates, teachers and friends of Alex,' she said. The district is making social workers and school counselors available for grief counseling and support for any students and staff as needed, Quattlebaum said. The school's assistant principal called  the Newsome family once the paramedics arrived and Alex's mother Brandie never thought she'd lose her son. 'She said he had been hit in the head with the ball and the coaches had resuscitated him on the field,' Newsome said. Alex was a sixth grader at Roland-Grise Middle School in Wilmington, North Carolina and was having a practice at the school when the accident occurred . Friends of the family shared their condolences on social media following Alex Newsome's tragic death . 'We knew it was serious, but we never imagined it wouldn't be OK in the end.' Worried parents Brandie and Gerrcik Newsom waited as a team of doctors led by neurosurgeon George Huffmon worked to remove fluid from Alex's brain. 'All the medical staff were crying,' said Alex's mother. Throughout the night friends and family posted their support and wishes for the family on twitter under #Newsomestrong. 'So sorry for the loss of a young man playing the sport he loved-tragic #Newsomestrong prayers to the family and team. Angel in the outfeild,' said carol Brown. Other's followed suit with kind words and did their best to honor Alex Newsome's memory. A few teams decided on Saturday to cancel their games next week, including the major league at Winter Park Optimist, for which Alex played. On Saturday, the Newsomes tried to process what was happening to them. 'We don't know how we'll move on from this,' Brandie Newsome said. 'There's always been the four of us doing everything. I don't know how we'll be just three.' There were numbers of kind messages to the family under #NewsomeStrong .","Alex Newsome was .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . and Associated Press Reporter . A Wyoming landslide about the size of two football fields continues to slowly move down a hill, causing nearby residents to evacuate - and splitting apart one home. 48 Jackson residents as well as several businesses were evacuated, according to a CNN report. The residents checked in to a Red Cross station. So far, only one unoccupied home has sustained any damage. The house is directly atop the slide zone and its interior wooden floor seems to be splitting in two, Assistant Town Manager Roxanne Robinson told the channel. Crack: A large fissure can be seen in the ground in this photo . Landslide: the landslide continues to shift, officials say making it unsafe for Jackson residents to return home . Hope: a geologist put the risk of sudden collapse at just 5 percent . 'What really struck me is the wood flooring, which is separating,' Robinson said. 'One half of the house looks like it's on side of the slide area and the other half is definitely at the crest of the slide.' Robinson also said that the home's driveway is cracked by a 6-1o-12-inch upward fissure. According to CNN, the landslide moves slowly enough for officials to observe ground cracks and monitor its path each day. Officials say the landslide continues to shift, making it unsafe for residents of mostly apartments to return home even though the apartments are outside the area where the highest risk of a collapse exists. 'The cracks continue to widen and deepen,' Robinson said on Saturday. 'If it keeps sliding every day, other complications could arise.' Evacuated: 48 Jackson residents have reported to a Red Cross station . Damage: a large crack can also be seen in this photo of the affected Jackson area . Helping hand: the American Red Cross is set to open a shelter for displaced residents on Sunday night . Residents are allowed escorted access to their homes to check on them and pick up personal belongings, but no one is allowed to stay overnight, Robinson said. About 43 people were escorted to their homes on Saturday as well as between 9am and 5pm on Sunday, according to a town press release.  Residents requesting escorted access on Monday will be able to do so by appointment only. The Red Cross has provided 18 displaced residents with hotel rooms until now. But the continuing uncertainty of when they can return home has led the agency to open a shelter. Evacuees were told that they can report to the Teton County Fair Grounds Exhibition Hall at 6pm on Sunday night, according to a town press release. Displaced: no one can say right now when residents might be allowed back home . No one can say right now when residents might be allowed back home, Robinson said. Robinson said portable water tanks were being placed on the unstable hill in case a fire breaks out. The shifting hill has broken permanent water lines, and the temporary water lines that have been put in place don't provide sufficient pressure for firefighting, she said. There are power lines on the hill that could be brought down by the slide and spark a fire. 'It's definitely dry on the hill, and we need to have a water supply that we can access in a hurry should it be necessary,' said Mike Moyer, an official with the local incident command team. At the foot of the slide zone, two restaurants, a liquor store and a just-built Walgreens remain closed amid a slim but persistent risk the hill could collapse suddenly. A geologist put the risk of sudden collapse at just 5 percent.","A landslide about the size of two football fields continues to slowly move down hillside near Jackson .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Belinda Carlisle has now completed training to become a yoga instructor . Eighties pop veteran Belinda Carlisle may be back in the charts, but don’t expect a major comeback. At 55, and with a string of hits behind her, Belinda has decided on a new career – in yoga. She recently completed training as an instructor and plans to start leading classes. She says: ‘I’ve been doing yoga on and off for 20 years but I became more serious about it six years ago. I do it every day for up to four hours.’ The American star is an advocate of Kundalini yoga. ‘It’s more internal and  about energy and chakras and breaking through emotional barriers. It’s pretty intense,’ she says. Belinda, whose new album is a greatest-hits set called The Collection, has also returned to vegetarianism after a 20-year break. ‘I just couldn’t eat meat any more. I found it disgusting and I can’t support factory farming – it’s too cruel. I don’t feel deprived, though, even though I don’t drink, smoke or eat meat. I’ve had 30 years of all that and I don’t feel I’m missing anything.’ Fertility experts are trying to find out if vitamins could help outcomes for IVF patients. ‘Recent studies suggest a Mediterranean diet rich in Vitamin D and Omega-3 might improve the outcome from IVF,’ says Professor Nick Macklon, medical director of the Complete Fertility Centre at University Hospital, Southampton, where the trial involving 110 couples is running. The study is assessing how following two different diets six weeks prior to IVF treatment affects the quality of sperm and egg cells. People who have hernia repairs expect to recover too quickly and so cope less well, says new research. The operation involves closing a gap in the  muscle walls of the abdomen, through which soft tissue can protrude and cause pain. While the repair can be done quickly using keyhole surgery, people often feel pain and fatigue for up to a week afterwards. Women and people under 60 take even longer, say researchers, at the US Mayo Clinic. Help is at hand for women who want to wear skirts or shorts but are put off by unsightly leg tattoos. A new make-up, Cover Secret Leg Camouflage Kit, has been launched to hide ‘leg imperfections’, which may also include varicose veins and scars. It lasts 24 hours and is water-resistant so can be used on the beach. The £34.99 kit is available in light or medium. coversecret.co.uk .

"By . Richard Spillett . Heartless thieves have left a couple devastated after ransacking their home and stealing laptops, jewellery - and their pet SAUSAGE DOG. Plumber Marc Rose, 26, came back to to his home in Carleton, near Blackpool, Lancashire on Monday lunchtime to find two computers, an iPad, an iPhone 5 and a gold watch had been stolen, while the stairs had been daubed with spray paint. But the misery for he and his girlfriend, Jade Earley, was made all the worse when they realised the burglars had also taken their four-month-old pedigree dachshund, Richie. Scroll down for video . Four-month-old pedigree dachshund Richie, whose owners Marc Rose and Jade Earley are devastated after he was stolen from their home during a raid by burglars . Heartbroken Mr Rose says losing Richie was like having a child snatched from him . The pet dog, worth around £1,000, was bought by Mr Rose as a Christmas present for Miss Earley. The emotional couple have now made an heart-felt plea to the thieves to return Richie - as they continue to walk the streets looking for him. Mr Rose blasted the criminals as 'sick', adding: 'It’s like taking a child because he’s been a massive part of the family for the last four months and now he’s gone. 'I don’t mind the other things being taken, but not my dog. I’m seething with anger, but that’s not getting me anywhere. 'We’d been talking about getting a dog for a long time and we thought long and hard about getting one. 'He was beautiful when I first saw him and we are devastated. I just hope we get some justice and they go to prison because that’s what they deserve.' The couple say Richie, who was a Christmas present for Miss Earley, would have been petrified of any intruders . Mr Rose and Miss Earley have been walking the streets looking for Richie and have put up posters in Carleton, Lancashire . Richie is kept in the conservatory during the day and would have been unable to get out without someone opening the door. The front door was also closed when Mr Rose came home, meaning Richie couldn’t have escaped of his own accord. Miss Earley, 24, a beauty manager at Tesco, says the couple have notified the RSPCA and local dog kennels, are now depserately looking for Richie in places where they usually walk him. She added: 'It’s the worst possible thing imaginable. 'You would think someone coming into your house is bad enough, but nothing compares to them taking your dog. It’s awful. 'He’s small and is nervous around people anyway, so he would’ve been scared and tried to hide behind the couch to get away. 'We’ve been everywhere we can think of and it's just a complete worry.' Lancashire Police have appealed for anyone in the area with information to call 101.","Burglars broke into Lancashire home of plumber Marc Rose on Monday .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Pure-bred dogs are no less healthy than their cross-breed counterparts, according to a new large-scale study which questions their reputation for poor health. Scientists from the Royal Veterinary College analysed the medical records of 150,000 dogs expecting to prove the conventional wisdom that selective breeding makes pedigrees more vulnerable to serious conditions such as heart murmurs and joint problems. But, to their surprise, it turned out that mongrel and pedigree dogs have broadly the same chance of developing the most common health problems. No difference: The study found that there are not significantly differences in the vulnerability to common diseases of pedigree dogs, such as the Border Collie pictured left, as opposed to mongrels like the dog on the right . Reputation: The study goes against the received wisdom that mongrels, like those pictured above, are more healthy . In fact, in the case of degenerative joint disease, mongrels were found to be more vulnerable. Of the 20 most common conditions, only ear infections, obesity and skin growths were observed to be any more common for pedigree animals. The data was gathered from 100 vet practices in the Midlands and South East of England over the past five years, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Dr Dan O'Neill, who led the study, told the newspaper: 'The outcome is that there is not strong or convincing evidence of a difference between purebreeds and crossbreeds in their health. Designer dogs: The study also found that specially-bred crosses, such as the labradoodle pictured left, are also neither more nor less healthy than pedigrees (such as the Jack Russell, right) or mongrels . 'There is this image of crossbreeds as paragons of health. In fact they are just crosses of purebreds, with combinations of prevalences you find in their parent. It is not that they are healthier overall, and it is wrong to stigmatise purebreds.' Estimates suggest that around three quarters of Britain's 9million pet dogs are pedigrees. The 150,000 dogs studied included mongrel dogs as well as selectively-bred crosses such as labradoodles and cockerpoos, but did not suggest a difference in their overall health. Although the chances of a given dog developing diseases was not affected by the purity of their breed, the data did reveal that crossbreeds on average live a year longer than pedigrees - to 13 instead of 12.","Royal Veterinary College scientists analysed 150,000 dog medical records .

"By . Damien Gayle . Comatose former F1 . ace Michael Schumacher is showing signs of improvement which have . brought 'great joy' to his family, his old racing rival Jean Alesi says. French . driver Alesi, 49, spoke after visiting Schumacher at the hospital in . Grenoble, France, where he has been in an induced coma for three months. He said his F1 contemporary appeared to be getting better, but seemed a long way from recovery. Racing rivals: Michael Schumacher, right, and Jean Alesi chat before the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne, in 2000. The French racer said his F1 contemporary was showing signs of improvement . 'During my recent visit I . noticed that something has improved. I have felt in the family a . relief, a great joy about how things are developing,' he told German . motorsport magazine Speedweek. 'This is great, even if the path back to life is still very long.' Schumacher, . 45, suffered a near-fatal head injury in an accident while skiing with . his son in the Alpine resort of Meribel on December 29. It is not the first time that Alesi has been to see Schumacher, an F1 legend with seven championships and 91 wins to his name. Alesi . said of his earlier visits: 'First of all, Michael responded only to . pain, so if you have pinched him for example. But this can also be an . unconscious reaction of the body.' New hope: Schumacher's manager last week said the F1 driver has shown 'encouraging signs' of improvement . The Italian former race driver's . comments were the second piece of good news about Schumacher's condition . in a week, after the German's manager Sabine Kehm announced he was . showing 'moments of consciousness'. 'Michael is making progress on his way,' she said. 'He shows moments of consciousness and awakening. 'We . are on his side during his long and difficult fight, together with the . team of the hospital in Grenoble, and we keep remaining confident.' Speaking . last Friday, she added that no further details would be given out of . respect to his family and to 'enable the medical team to work in full . calmness'. Bring him home: Reports had claimed that Corinna planned to build a multi-million pound facility so her husband can leave hospital, but these were subsequently denied by family and friends of the former F1 ace . Gary Hartstein, a former Formula One doctor, said 'awakening' would mean that Schumacher has opened his eyes. He . said: 'This eye opening can even be cyclic, following what looks just . like a sleep-wake cycle (even if not synchronised to real day-night . hours).' And he said the 'moments of consciousness' meant that Schumacher would have had interaction with his environment. He . said: 'It consists of episodes of clear, purposeful interaction with . the environment, and/or clear signs of awareness of self, even if these . signs are not constantly present. 'For . example, if Michael smiles when a member of his entourage talks to him - . reproducibly and consistently on at least a few occasions. Or following . people with his eyes. 'Or trying to communicate, or obeying simple . commands. Any of this constitutes objective signs of contact between the . ""outside"" and the ""inside"". This then would be a minimally conscious . state. And that is about the best news we could possibly get right now.' Successful: The Â£25million estate on the shores of Lake Geneva where the Schumacher family live . Despite the continuing . encouraging signs, the prognosis is that Schumacher will not be moved . from Grenoble Hospital anytime soon. His . family and friends have also stressed there is no truth in wild rumours . that his wife Corinna 'has built or plans to build any kind of medical . suite for Michael on any of the buildings on their land in Gland, . Switzerland. This includes future buildings'. When doctors give the go-ahead he will be moved to a rehabilitation clinic, according to a family friend. The friend said: 'There will be a very significant amount of rehab required.' Keen skier: Thrill-seeker Schumacher had been a keen and skilled skier before his accident in December . Waiting: The Grenoble University Hospital, where Schumacher has been in an induced coma for three months . Loving support: Corinna arrives at the hospital to which she and family make a daily 150-mile round trip . It . will be 15 weeks ago on Sunday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his . life-threatening accident while skiing in Meribel, where he owns a . chalet. Doctors began the process of gradually awakening him more than nine weeks ago. Ms . Kehm said it is 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the . racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a . 'banal situation'. The accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in an off-piste area in the French resort of Meribel. He . was skiing with his 14-year-old son when he lost control after hitting a . rock. He ended up smashing his head into a bolder 34 feet further down . the mountain. He is receiving round-the-clock care in intensive care in Grenoble University Hospital. Corinna, with whom he has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. His family have remained confident throughout the tragedy that Schumacher will recover. A . statement released last month said: 'We are and remain confident that . Michael will pull through and will wake up. There sometimes are small, . encouraging signs, but we also know that this is the time to be very . patient.' His manager has . stood by this statement during the last few weeks amidst the negativity . offered by certain doctors who have nothing to do with his treatment. In February French investigators closed the official inquiry into his accident, ruling out any criminal wrongdoing.","F1 ace's old racing rival says he is showing signs of improvement .

"By . Associated Press . Captain America continued to flex its Marvel muscle at the global box office, as The Winter Soldier took in $41.4 million domestically and $60.6 million overseas. The strong second-week performance for the Walt Disney release in North America was enough to narrowly edge 20th Century Fox's ""Rio 2"" in a springtime battle of sequels. The animated Amazon jungle tale ""Rio 2"" debuted with $39 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, almost exactly the opening weekend total of the 2011 Oscar-nominated original. But Captain America has grown considerably in stature since its 2011 original, The First Avenger. With a global cumulative total of nearly $477 million, The Winter Soldier has (in two weeks domestically, three weeks internationally) easily surpassed the $370 million total of The First Avenger. Captian America topped the box office after making over $60 million internationally and over $40 million in the US . For a superhero whose costume is draped with the U.S. flag, Captain America (played by Chris Evans) has proven particularly popular abroad. The international appeal of such a traditionally patriot figure was once doubted.'The traditional rules just don't apply anymore. It's really about that Marvel brand,' said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak. Captain America' can play in Peoria just as well as Hong Kong. Rio 2, with a voice cast including Anna Kendrick and Jessie Eisenberg, also played well internationally. In its second week of release overseas, it made $62.5 million. Two other new releases opened in a distant third and fourth place. The low-budget supernatural horror film Oculus took in $12 million for Relativity Media. The box office smash stars Scarlett Johansson (left) and Chris Evans (right) The football drama Draft Day, starring Kevin Costner and directed by Ivan Reitman, debuted weakly with $9.8 million. Made with the cooperation of the National Football League, the Lionsgate release is the second movie this year, along with the thriller 3 Days to Kill, to attempt to restore the 59-year-old Costner to leading man status. The overall box office for the year is up more than 7 percent over 2013's record box-office haul. The month of April has been propelled especially by the summer-style release of ""The Winter Soldier"" and a number of less likely successes. With $39.5 million domestically, the Wes Anderson caper The Grand Budapest Hotel has performed exceptionally in a gradual release by Fox Searchlight. The independently released Christian film God's Not Dead, from Freestyle Releasing, has made a whopping $40.7 million in four weeks. The Winter Soldier has been more popular abroad than have other American films . Just holding in the top five was Lionsgate's teen sci-fi franchise-starter Divergent, which added $7.5 million in its fourth week to bring its cumulative total to $124.9 million. Lionsgate announced Friday that the third installment in the series (a sequel for 2015 is already in the works) will be split into two releases. The final book in Veronica Roth's young-adult trilogy, Allegiant, will be made into two installments, one to open in March 2016, the other in March 2017.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak.

"By . Ian Drury . Satisfaction in being British has fallen to an all-time low with only one-third of people saying they are ‘very proud’ of their national identity. A new study has found just 35 per cent are ‘very proud’ to be British, compared with 43 per cent a decade ago. Nearly half said they were ‘somewhat proud’. Opposition to the Iraq war and the fallout from the economic crisis are among the chief factors national pride has dwindled since 2003. Despite events such as the Royal wedding and the Olympics, just a third of people are 'very proud' to be British . Penny Young, of NatCen Social Research, which carried out the annual British Social Attitudes survey, said the drop of 8 percentage points was a ‘marked fall’. She said: ‘There was a lot of confidence in Britain in 2003 but now we are still recovering from the financial crash. Researchers say people were more positive about Britain in 2003 before the country slumped into a recession . ‘But for some people, greater exposure to other countries through budget travel and a wider digital community can lead them to query what it means to be British. ‘The big unknown is whether today’s young people will grow more proud of their British heritage. ‘Even if pride increases with age, there is a lot of ground to make up and as a result we would envisage a continued decline.’ The survey, carried out last year and to be published within months,found only 20 per cent of young people aged between 18 and 24 are ‘very proud’ to be British, compared with a third in 2003. The figure increases for older age groups and peaks at 63 per cent for over-65s. Women are marginally less proud than men but there were significant differences depending on the education and social class of the respondent. A fifth of those with degrees said they were very proud to be British, compared with 59 per cent of those who have no qualifications. And the study discovered that a third of those in the top three social classes - professional, managerial and skilled non-manual - were very proud. compared to more than 50 per cent in the bottom three - skilled manual, partly skilled and unskilled occupations. Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future think-tank, said: ‘For the more educated and affluent there is a cultural aversion to strong patriotism - they are more cosmopolitan. ‘There is a massive age gap in things like support for UKIP so young people might feel that being very proud is something associated with extremist groups.’ The deeply unpopular Iraq war also sapped confidence in the nation, especially among young people . He said there was evidence of a shift towards Britishness becoming a secondary identity. ‘Britishness is still there in the background and we will come together for events such as the jubilee or the First . World War centenary but the other nationalities are gaining ground.’ Despite the decline, more people were very proud of Britain’s achievements in the arts, literature, science and technology, where the nation has consistently punched above its weight in the world. More than half of people said they were very proud of the Armed Forces and the UK’s history and pride in Britain’s sporting achievements has doubled in the past decade, boosted by the London Olympics in 2012 and a slew of gold medals. A separate poll for the Sunday Times found that the Queen was the person who best represented Britain. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry also appear in the top five. Hugo Vickers, a royal biographer, said: ‘The monarchy and the Queen remain the cornerstone of British society. She represents many of the qualities considered typical of British identity.’","In 2003, 43 per cent of people said the felt 'very proud' to be British .

"By . Wills Robinson . Bob Wilson, 72, will undergo treatment for prostate cancer, but hopes to return to public life in the near future . Former goalkeeper and veteran broadcaster Bob Wilson has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The 72-year-old, who made 234 appearances for Arsenal in the 1960s and 1970s and was capped by Scotland, has cancelled upcoming work and charity commitments, including those for the charitable Willow Foundation that he founded with his wife Megs. The pundit, who retired from playing in 1974 but took up a role as a goalkeeping coach with Arsenal for several years, was at Wembley for the Gunners' FA Cup semi-final victory over Wigan Athletic yesterday. He is set to undergro treatment for the disease and is confident he will return to public life as soon as possible, he said. Wilson, who also worked as a television presenter for BBC and ITV, said: 'I am very confident that the treatment I am receiving will prove successful and kindly ask that my privacy is respected at this time.' His son, BBC Radio 4 presenter John Wilson, said: 'Knowing how strong my dad is, I have every faith he will be back to match fitness very soon indeed.' Wilson's daughter, Anna, died in 1998 aged 31 after succumbing to a rare form of cancer. Her widower, 44-year-old Mitchell Carey, died in 2010 in hospital from an acute bout of food poisoning. Wilson started his career at the age of 21, initially training as a teacher because his father did not think it was a reasonable job. He signed for Arsenal in 1963 after playing a number of reserve games for Wolverhampton Wanderers. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the UK, although the numbers of those with the disease is on the rise. Every year in the UK more than 40,000 men are struck with prostate cancer. Around 250,000 are currently living with the disease, with symptoms including frequent trips to the toilet, pain during sex and reduced flow of urine. However, not all men diagnosed with prostate cancer have symptoms, meaning it is important to speak regularly with doctors. Star: The goalkeeper played for Arsenal in the 1960s and 1970s and was also capped by Scotland . Veteran: After retiring, Bob Wilson (right) returned to the club as Arsenal's goalkeeping coach. Here he is pictured with his close friend and former England goalkeeper David Seaman (left) Background: Bob Wilson made 234 appearances for the north London club. He initially trained as a teacher because his father did not think a professional footballer was a proper job . Treatment can include keyhole surgery and radiotherapy. A Prostate Cancer UK spokesman said: 'We send Bob Wilson our best wishes in his fight against prostate cancer. 'A key figure in the football world, he has already been affected by the tragic consequences of cancer, and his tireless work for the Willow Foundation, set up in the memory of his late daughter, continues to this day. 'It says everything of the man that he has already pledged to return to those efforts as soon as he can. Family: Wilson's daughter Anna, pictured, died in 1998 at the age of 31 from a rare form of cancer . 'Prostate cancer is an opponent like no other. It is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the UK and affects one in eight men in the UK. 'Our Men United v Prostate Cancer campaign aims to raise awareness and intensify the search for more reliable tests and treatments. 'The football family stands behind Bob, and we offer him and his family our support and best wishes at this important time.'

"A woman was forced to 'sit and watch' her electricity meter for 39 days by her energy supplier, because they couldn't tell her when her tariff had changed. Sue Hufton was told by Scottish Power call centre staff that the only way to work out when the cheap rate started and finished, was to wait and watch. She then checked her teleswitch meter every five minutes in an attempt to record when the meter was switching. A woman who was forced to 'sit and watch' her electricity meter for 39 days by her energy supplier, because they couldn't tell her when her tariff had changed . Mrs Hufton, 58, of Leicestershire, said: 'I lost the will to live in the end. It was so frustrating.' She is one of a number of people who contacted consumer rights magazine Which? for advice on checking meter clocks. She had been concerned because her bill was a third higher than for similar neighbouring properties last summer. An investigation by the magazine showed that families - including those on tariffs such as Economy 7 or Economy 10 - could have been overcharged without knowing it. It is because energy suppliers are not required to check the accuracy of meter clocks when taking readings. After the magazine intervened, Scottish Power contacted her to give her the answer she had been looking for. An investigation by Which? magazine showed that families - including those on tariffs such as Economy 7 or Economy 10 - could have been overcharged without knowing it . It revealed that her bills were high because she was using electricity during peak time, erroneously assuming it was the cheaper rate. She said: 'My supplier was so objectionable about giving me this information that I thought maybe I was not entitled to it. I feel I have been treated pretty shabbily.' A Which? spokeswoman told the Sunday Express: 'It’s outrageous that consumers are being left to work out the hours on their Economy 7 tariffs. It’s this kind of poor customer service that erodes trust in the energy industry.' Mrs Hufton has since received an apology, a bouquet and was reimbursed £75 for expenses incurred. A Scottish Power spokesman said: 'Scottish Power aims to provide a high standard of service at all times and we are sorry that Mrs Hufton did not receive the level of service expected.' Energy . tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd consumers can take advantage of . this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to . ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will . save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If you are one of the millions of . people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original . supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly . as much as £300 a year. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.","Sue Hufton told to 'sit and watch' by Scottish Power call centre staff .

"By . Chris Paine . These stark pictures clearly show the ravages of poor Lola's body after her own owners starved her for six weeks. The animal's spine, ribs and leg bones are clearly visible after Jennifer Plater and Michael Knight's shocking display of ill treatment of the weimaraner breed. Plater, 39, and her 40-year-old partner failed to turn up at court to face joint charges of causing unnecessary suffering to their dog, but were found guilty in their absence. Lola, a weimaraner breed, was brought in by authorities after being starved for six weeks by her owners Jennifer Plater and Michael Knight - who have been convicted of animal cruelty . The animal's spine, ribs and leg bones are clearly visible, and she weighed just 15.5kg when she was brought in . Vet Angus McKenzie, who examined Lola on behalf of the RSPCA, rated her on an 0 - 5 body weight index emaciation scale at just 0.5 . Magistrates have now issued an arrest warrant for the pair, warning that they could face up to four months in jail for the offences. Tony Stock, prosecuting, said that the alarm had been raised after neighbours called in the RSPCA to investigate after becoming concerned about Lola's severe weight loss. He said: 'They said that they could see every bone in her body, she was so thin.' RSPCA Inspector Vicky McDonald was called to the house and seized the dog after finding that Lola was 'very emaciated' with her skeletal features visible. Speaking at Wigan and Leigh Magistrates Court, Mr Stock added: 'When she lifted Lola into the Society's vehicle she was taken aback by how light Lola was and how easy it was to lift her.' Vet Angus McKenzie, who examined Lola on behalf of the charity, rated her on an 0 - 5 body weight index emaciation scale at just 0.5. He found the dog to be dehydrated and suffering as a result of being starved for 'at least six weeks or longer'. Lola's weight has increased her weight to 21.4kg from 15.5kg - a gain of 47.6 per cent - within six weeks of being taken into care . Lola was taken into the care of the RSPCA on December 14 weighing 15.5 kg. But by January 29, pointed out Mr Stock, she had increased her weight through normal feeding to 21.4 kg or a 47.6 per cent weight gain. The couple, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, face joint charges of causing unnecessary suffering to the pet by failing to investigate her weight loss and poor condition. They were also accused of failing in a duty of care to ensure they met the dog's needs for fresh drinking water. The dog has now been happily re-homed by the RSPCA.","Jennifer Plater and Michael Knight found guilty of animal cruelty .

This video shows the hilarious moment a woman talked her way into a 300-day prison sentence for contempt of court. Ebony Burks, 32, appeared in Elyria Municipal Court, Ohio, accused of domestic violence and assault. Speaking to her over video feed, judge Gary Bennett told her she was not to have contact with either of the victims involved. Burks took issue with the fact she would not be able to contact or see her grandfather, Shedrick McCray, because she lived in his house. After she lost her cool, Burks was . initially handed down 30 days by Judge Bennett. But as she continued to . argue and speak aggressively towards the judge, he gradually increased . the prison sentence.

"By . Mark Duell . Champagne shipments to Britain plummeted last year as consumers switched to cheaper alternatives such as prosecco, a report has revealed. Volume sales were down 5.1 per cent and value sales dropped 3.8 per cent, according to the UK Champagne Bureau. And latest research shows that sales of cheaper sparkling wines including prosecco and cava soared over the same period. Falling popularity: Volume sales of Champagne were down 5.1 per cent and value sales dropped 3.8 per cent . Demand: Despite the dismal trading figures, Britain remains the top export destination of the Champagne region in France (pictured) UK Champagne Bureau director Francoise Peretti told Off Licence News: ‘The UK Champagne market is typically procyclical, with a pronounced tendency to late reaction. ‘It is not unusual to see the consequences of an economic downturn maybe one or two years after the event.’ Meanwhile, sparkling wine excluding Champagne grew 8 per cent in volume and 15 per cent in value to £464million in the off-trade. It commands an average price of £9.01, whereas Champagne sells for an average of £25.92. In the on-trade sparkling wine such as Prosecco and Cava grew 11 per cent in volume and 18 per cent in value.

"By . William Turvill . With wooden wheels, a top speed of 21mph, three horsepower and an electric engine, this is hardly the sort of model you'd associate with a renowned car maker. But this vehicle, resembling a wooden crate on wheels, was the first car ever designed by the founder of Porsche, Ferdinand Porsche, when he was 22 years old in 1898. The model, released more than 30 years before the Porsche brand was founded in 1931, was recently discovered in an Austrian garage, where it had remained untouched since 1902. Scroll down for video .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The year since Jeff Bauman was pushed in a wheelchair from the Boston Marathon, his legs ravaged and his face ashen, has been marked by pain and difficulty but also by triumphs: . He's learned to walk on new prosthetic legs, he's gotten engaged and he's an expectant father. Bauman became one of the most recognizable and powerful symbols of Boston's resilience after the April 15 attacks - immortalized in an Associated Press photo that shows three rescuers rushing him from the scene. Heroes:  Boston EMT Paul Mitchell, left, bystander Carlos Arredondo, in cowboy hat, and Boston University student Devin Wang push Jeff Bauman in a wheelchair after he was injured in one of two explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon .

Recovering: Jeff Bauman stands in his home in Carlisle, Massachusetts with his new prosthetic legs, while (right) Boston Emergency Medical Services EMT, Paul Mitchell stands next to an ambulance one year on . He became a hero days later when he was able to help authorities identify one of two brothers accused of setting off pressure cooker bombs, killing two women and an 8-year-old boy and injuring more than 260 others. His memoir, 'Stronger,' comes out Tuesday. The past year has been a blur for Bauman, and he can't get used to the idea that this is his new life. 'Right now, you know, it's kind of a challenge to put my legs on every day. I'm not used to it. It's something unnatural for me. But I think over time it will become more of a natural thing,' Bauman, 28, told the AP in an interview at the home he shares with his fiancee, Erin Hurley. 'At first I couldn't even wear them for 20 minutes. ... Now, I can wear them all day.' Disaster: In this April 15, 2013 file photo, medical workers aid injured people near the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon following two bomb explosions in Boston . Bauman was standing near the finish line with two friends, waiting to cheer on Hurley as she completed the marathon, one of the most important and busiest events of the year in the city. He noticed a man who looked out of place in a crowd of revelers, and they exchanged a long stare. As Bauman describes him, he was 'all business.' Moments later, the two bombs exploded. Bauman found himself on the ground, his legs gone. People rushed in to help, but Bauman thought it was the end. Suddenly, a man in a cowboy hat appeared: Carlos Arredondo. He lifted Bauman into a wheelchair pushed by Devin Wang, a Boston University student, and they rushed toward the medical tents. They were joined along the way by Paul Mitchell, an EMT with Boston EMS. 'When someone looks that way, they've lost a lot of blood, and they're really close to being dead,' Mitchell said. New life: Jeff Bauman adjusts one of his prosthetic legs at his home. Bauman lost both of his legs in the Boston Marathon bombings and helped identify one of the two brothers accused of setting off the explosions, which killed three and injured more that 260 others . Thanks to his rescuers, he lived. He was in surgery within 20 minutes at Boston Medical Center. Soon after Bauman woke, he was able to provide a description of the man who was 'all business.' Authorities say it was Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a shootout with police in Watertown days later. Tsarnaev's brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. Bauman calls the brothers 'weak' and says they wasted their lives. He said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev must suffer from knowing what he did, especially killing a child. 'You can't tell me that that doesn't eat away at that kid every single day. It has to. It must haunt him,' he said. 'Or if it doesn't, it eventually will.' Bauman has focused on healing and learning to manage his new legs. He lost his legs above the knee, making it harder to adjust to his prosthetics. It takes more energy to walk with prosthetics than it does to walk normally, which means he gets tired easily. Jeff Bauman, who lost both his legs above the knee in the Boston Marathon bombing, poses with his fiancee Erin Hurley at their Carlisle, home. The couple are expecting their first child in July . He has made steady progress, and by March, he was walking with one crutch. He hopes to someday be able to walk without the crutches and to use the prosthetics all day without his legs getting sore, as they do now. Sleeping was tough for him the first few months, and he still has nights when his mind is racing too fast to get any sleep. Days can be tough, too. 'I have bad days, days when I just don't want to do anything. Just kind of want to lay in bed,' he said. 'I don't want to see anybody today. There's days like that.' Bauman is on leave from the Costco store where he worked in Nashua, N.H., before the bombing. He wants to learn how to drive again before going back, and he has a rigorous rehabilitation schedule that requires several appointments a week. He also feels he's not prepared mentally to return yet. For now, Bauman and Hurley are preparing for the baby, due July 14. They got engaged in February and tentatively plan to get married next year, Hurley said. An EMT. A volunteer. A spectator in a cowboy hat. Moments after bombs exploded at the Boston Marathon, these three helped rescue a man whose legs were blown off, a scene captured in an Associated Press photo. That man, Jeff Bauman, was lauded as a hero himself when he gave authorities a description that helped them track down two suspects. PAUL MITCHELL . Mitchell has been a Boston EMT for five years. Like the others in the photo, he refuses to take credit for saving Bauman's life. 'I think a lot of things went into Jeff being alive today, not to mention the will of this guy. I met him once or twice. He's got the attitude. The positive spirit.' Looking at the photo reminds him to 'live life to the fullest.' 'Two of those people in that picture, not me, don't have any training, don't have any obligation to run in there - and they did.' DEVIN WANG . Wang is an aspiring athletic trainer, a senior at Boston University and a world-class synchronized skater. That day she was a race volunteer. 'I think instinct kicked in, knowing that there were spectators in that general area, not knowing if there's going to be another explosion, not knowing what I was going to see once I got there,' Wang told ESPN. 'I felt like I did not do as much as so many other people, yet I was getting all the credit for being that hero.' Twin bombs: The second detonation  is seen going off - while the first explosion is seen as a cloud of smoke in the distance . CARLOS ARREDONDO . In his native Costa Rica, Arredondo was a rodeo clown, helping get fallen riders out of the way of angry bulls. 'Years of doing that kind of adrenaline, you're rushing in and out, running up and out to get people out of there. ... In a way I was training myself for the Boston Marathon.' He was passing out American flags on the race sidelines and ran to Bauman after the blasts. 'I thought, `How am I going to get him out of here?'' 'And then I saw this miracle woman coming with a wheelchair,' Arredondo recalled. 'And it saved his life.' JEFF BAUMAN . Bauman, who wrote a book about his experience, says he has mixed feelings about the photo. 'I never look at it. I can't. I Googled myself once, and I looked at it and I was like, I can't look at that. That just brings me right back to me laying on the ground.' But Bauman says it sums up the good that happened that day. 'I thought that was amazing that they helped save my life like that. ... Everyone was just trying to help me, help us, you know. Help the people that were hurt.' Bauman admits he has some jitters. 'I'm kind of scared, I don't know. I mean, I just want to be able to be there physically when the baby's running around and going nuts,' he said. They don't know yet if it's a boy or a girl. To be safe, Bauman painted the nursery a neutral shade of gray. The couple moved into a home in rural Carlisle, northwest of Boston, in the fall. Before then, Bauman lived with his mother in an apartment in Chelmsford, an old mill town to the north. Hurley says Bauman is still deciding whether to go back to school or pursue other opportunities that have arisen since the bombing. 'He can do anything he wants really. But all he wants to do is walk. I think that's a good goal for now,' she said. 'Plus, we have the baby coming. That's going to be a big project. Like a lifetime project.' For this year's marathon, the couple plans to spend some time at the race, though Bauman admits to being apprehensive - not because he's worried it's not safe but because of his celebrity. 'I'm kind of scared about that,' he said. 'I don't want to be mobbed and hoisted up in a crowd.'","Iconic image of the rescue of injured Jeff Bauman from the scene of the Boston marathon bombings is remembered .

"A man whose car plunged 80ft from a cliff and landed in the sea has escaped practically unharmed - and joked straight afterwards that a Red Bull he drank had made him 'fly'. The driver, who has not been named, careered off of the A259 in Sussex. His Ford Focus was moving fast enough that it cleared the concrete promenade at the base of the cliffs and landed in the sands. Remarkably, he suffered only minor injuries from the accident, which took place just after midnight. Above: Arrow shows path of the vehicle as it plunges on to the beach - and inset the car .

After the landing the man was able to walk from his car back to near the base of the cliff near Roedean, near Brighton, and meet emergency services. And he was in such good spirits that he was able to joke about his terrifying ordeal - saying that he'd taken off as a result of a Red Bull energy drink he'd had earlier that night. A member of the fire service who was involved in the initial response said: 'He just had a Red Bull - and it was that. That was making him fly.' The man was later lifted up the cliff-face with ladders and a stretcher and taken to a waiting ambulance. A Newhaven Coastguard spokesman said: 'The casualty was secured into Newhaven Coastguards rescue stretcher and then using some of our cliff rescue equipment we were able to slide the stretcher up the ladders. 'With nine members of various agencies on the three ropes and two of the Newhaven team at the top of the ladder we were able to bring the casualty up from the beach where they were handed into the care of paramedics.

Brighton and Newhaven lifeboat crews also made a brief sea search in opposite directions while two coastguard teams searched the beach a few hundred metres each side of the car in case anyone else was in the water. Chief Superintendent Nev Kemp, the commander of Bright and Hove's police tweeted after the incident: 'Incredibly a man escaped without serious injury after his car went over the cliff near Roedean just after midnight and ended up in the sea.'

"By . Associated Press . The Obama administration's timeline for having ready the new health care law's online sign-up system 'was just flat out wrong,' outgoing Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in an interview that aired Sunday. The departing health chief also said the two months when healthcare.gov was plagued with technical problems were 'a pretty dismal time' and the low point of her five-year tenure. But she defended the law's impact and said millions of Americans now have access to health care because of it. 'People have competitive choices and real information for the first time ever in this insurance market,' said Sebelius, who last week announced her resignation. Kathleen Sebelius (right) resigned as  Health and Human Services Secretary and said in an interview on Sunday that the timeline for healthcare sign up was wrong . But she acknowledged the rocky rollout for the online sign-up system fraught with technical problems that left Americans frustrated. 'Clearly, the estimate that it was ready to go Oct. 1 was just flat out wrong,' Sebelius said. HealthCare.gov was envisioned as the principal place for people to buy insurance under Obama's health care law. But its first few weeks were an embarrassment for the administration and its allies. 'Well, I think there's no question - and I've said this many times - that the launch of the website was terribly flawed and terribly difficult,' Sebelius said. Obama set a Dec. 1 deadline to have the website repaired, a move that left Sebelius nervous, she said. 'Having failed once at the front of October, the first of December became a critical juncture,' she said. 'That was a pretty scary date.' President Obama introduces his choice for Health and Human Services (HHS) Sec, Sylvia Mathews Burwell to replace Kathleen Sebelius . Sebelius' resignation comes just a week after sign-ups for insurance coverage ended, enrolling 7.1 million people and exceeding initial expectations. Enrollment has since increased to 7.5 million as people were given extra time to complete applications. The departing secretary said she decided after the 2012 presidential election that she wanted to leave the administration but decided to stay through the sign-up period. Sebelius said Obama did not try to convince her to stay through the end of his term. 'I thought it was fair to either commit till January of 2017 or leave with enough time that he would get a strong, competent leader,"" Sebelius said.Sebelius spoke to NBC's 'Meet the Press.'

"By . William Turvill . British Airways could be facing another union battle as cabin crew staff attempt to establish who wears the trousers. The British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association is said to be ready to challenge BA over rules which mean new female recruits must wear skirts with no option of trousers. Female crew members have been allowed to wear trousers on BA flights since 2004 - but now it seems that decision has been reversed. Power-dressing: British Airways staff in their uniforms. The airline decided to allow female cabin crew staff to wear trousers in 2004 but now it says only skirts are allowed . All new female employees joining the airline’s Mixed Fleet – which makes up 2,000 of the 15,000 cabin staff – are required to wear skirts. And, according to The Guardian, some crew members have asked their union, which is part of Unite, to raise the issue with BA. Unite has previously challenged BA over the conditions this group work in, with lower salaries and different terms and conditions to other staff. This photograph shows the British Airways uniform before it was redesigned by Julien MacDonald . The union branch’s discussions with BA have in the past been led by Unite’s general secretary Len McCluskey. The branch is now reportedly planning to conduct an online survey of its female members who work in the Mixed Fleet to decide whether further action will be taken. Good look: The British Airways uniform includes a hat and skirt for females which the airline says looks professional and smart . According to the paper, union representatives had ‘tentatively raised’ the issue with BA management but were told it was the airline’s intention for women not to wear trousers. All female BA cabin crew staff had the option to wear trousers while working between 2004, when a new uniform was designed by Julien McDonald, and 2010. From 2010, women joining the newly-established Mixed Fleet have been required to wear skirts. In 2004, the airline reportedly found that 70 per cent of female staff wanted to have a choice. The BA uniform trousers are said to be made up of 80 per cent wool and 20 per cent polyester and can be a more practical option than skirts. A British Airways spokesman said it had not received any complaints from Mixed Fleet staff since it was established in 2010. 'Our . newest cabin crew fleet has always had its own uniform since its . creation in 2010, with a number of unique aspects, such as female crew . wearing a hat and skirt,' they said. 'This is the uniform offered to new members of . cabin crew who are fully aware of this when they join the fleet. 'We believe our crew look professional and smart and we receive positive customer feedback on a regular basis.'","Union said to be ready to survey female members on whether to protest .

"By . Associated Press . The U.S. Navy on Saturday christened the first ship of its newest class of destroyers, a more than $3 billion, 610-foot-long warship sporting advanced technology and a stealthy shape designed to minimize its visibility on enemy radar and reduce the size of its crew. Named after the late Adm. Elmo 'Bud' Zumwalt, the newest destroyer's massive size and angular profile make it stand apart from other U.S. warships. And like its namesake, a reformer who spearheaded changes that helped shape the Navy by offering new opportunities to women and minorities, the Zumwalt will shepherd the fleet into a new era, officials said. Stealth by design: The U.S. Navy christened the USS Zumwalt on Saturday, a $7 billion stealth destroyer that hosts an incredible array of capabilities not seen in any other ship in the fleet . Ready to go to war: Streamers fly over Zumwalt DDG 1000 the first Zumwalt Class Multi-Mission Destroyer following its christening Saturday . 'This ship is a modern marvel, and it's going to take smart and creative and hardworking sailors like Bud Zumwalt to operate it,' Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus told the crowd of thousands at Bath Iron Works, where the ship has been under construction since 2009. Mouzetta Zumwalt-Weathers and Ann Zumwalt, the former admiral's daughters, each christened the ship by smashing a bottle of Champagne near its bow, followed by cheers and bursts of red, white and blue streamers.

Ann Zumwalt, left, and her sister Mouzetta Zumwalt-Weathers, right, christen Zumwalt DDG 1000 the first Zumwalt Class Multi-Mission Destroyer . They were joined at the ceremony by Zumwalt's son, retired Marine Lt. Col. Jim Zumwalt, who recalled 55 years ago, as a young boy, attending the christening of the USS Dewey, which his father commanded. Bud Zumwalt, who became the youngest chief of naval operations in 1970, promoted the first female and African-American officers to admirals and opened the door for women to become naval aviators and serve on warships. 'He strove for a Navy that was supportive, encouraging and compassionate toward all sailors, especially minorities and women,' his daughter Ann said. 'A Navy that not only fought wars but also fought discrimination in its ranks. He dreamt of a Navy that allowed its sailors a better quality of life.' Proud: Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, left to right, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, Rep. Mike Michaud, D-Maine, and Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, observe the color guard during the christening ceremony . Among the 15,000-ton warship's cutting-edge features are a composite deckhouse with hidden radar and sensors and an angular shape that officials say will allow it to be confused for a small fishing boat on radars. It also sports wave-piercing hull designed to reduce the ship's wake. It's the first U.S. ship to use electric propulsion and produces enough power to one day support the futuristic electromagnetic rail gun, which will be tested at sea in 2016. Inside, sailors will have more space to work and live because the Zumwalt will only require about half the crew of the current generation of destroyers. Meanwhile, fewer sailors will need to stand watch because of cameras and video monitors that show what's going on outside. That will allow the Navy to 'carry out its crucial mission at a time of budget constraints,' said Maine U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. The Zumwalt was originally supposed to be christened in October, but the ceremony was rescheduled because of the federal government shutdown. The ship is expected to be delivered to the Navy late this year and to enter service in 2016. It will be joined by two other destroyers in its class, which are also being built in Bath.","High-tech destroyer was christened on Saturday .

"By . William Turvill . A man was arrested after mistaking a female police officer for a stripper while in a pub with friends . A man was arrested after mistaking a female police officer for a stripper, mirroring a scene from comedy Only Fools and Horses. Paul Harbord, 27, was in a pub in Old Shotton, County Durham, with friends after an all-day drinking session when the officer walked in to investigate their ‘rowdy’ behaviour. After one of his friends had told him to expect ‘entertainment’, Harbord wrongly identified the officer as a stripogram, started dancing in front of her and whipped her with a bar towel, a court heard. The man, who works as a rigger, was then arrested but refused to believe she was a real officer until they arrived at a police station. Harbord, of Peterlee, County Durham, admitted obstructing a police officer and was given a six-month conditional discharge. He was also told to pay £85 and a £15 victim surcharge at Peterlee Magistrates Court. Harbord’s mistake echoes the plot of an episode of Only Fools and Horses, Dates, broadcast in 1988, in which Del Boy mistakes a female police officer for a stripper in the Nag’s Head pub. Jaxon Taylor, mitigating, said: ‘The defendant and a large group of friends were celebrating together. Some were dressed in pyjamas, some in Christmas jumpers. ‘They consumed a quantity of alcohol throughout the day. A number of the party became rowdy.' He added: ‘One of the defendant’s friends had suggested some entertainment had been booked for later. ‘When a lone female police officer attended he waved a beer towel from the bar in her face. ‘He honestly didn’t believe it was a . police officer until he got to the police station. He was quite . embarrassed by the whole situation. ‘His friends have had a good laugh at him but he realises how serious it is. It was an honest and genuine mistake.’ The situation mirrors this scene from the Only Fools and Horses 1988 Christmas special, Dates . Harbord, a rigger, made his mishap as he drank with friends in the Black Bull, in Old Shotton, County Durham, on December 29. Vicky Wilson, prosecuting, said: ‘He was part of a large group dressed up. At 9.30pm a female police officer arrived at the pub, following concerns that the group was rowdy. ‘Harbord shouted “look, here is one of the strippers” as he flicked a bar towel in the officers face.” Chairman of the bench David Carr described it as an ‘unfortunate affair’.

"By . William Turvill . Warrant: Andrew Rutter, who has been sentenced to six and a half years in jail for shaking his baby, is on the run . A father who violently shook his baby because he wouldn’t stop crying went on the run part-way through his trial, which saw him sentenced to six and a half years in prison. Andrew Rutter, 28, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, disappeared as evidence mounted against him over his cruelty to his son, Jacob. His trial, at Bolton Crown Court, continued in his absence after he went missing on Tuesday, and, after sentencing him, the judge issued a warrant for his arrest. While babysitting for the seven-month-old, Rutter sent a series of desperate text messages to the infant’s mother, Samantha Harper, 22, who was at work. ‘He is doing my head in, he won’t stop screaming,’ he wrote. ‘I can’t handle him,’ he said in a second message. And a third read: ‘If you keep being soft with him I’ll never have him again.’ The alarm was raised after Rutter sent a fourth text saying: ‘He can’t open his eyes, he’s gone all floppy.’ This was followed up with the message: ‘He won’t wake up - I’m getting worried now.’ Ms Harper called the out-of-hours doctors service for advice but the baby’s health deteriorated and he was taken to a walk-in centre. Staff examined him and called an ambulance to take him to hospital where was found to have been shaken so violently he suffered a bleed to his brain. Scans showed the youngster had suffered a subdural hematoma and he had to spend more than a month in hospital. Now two years old, Jacob is currently living with his grandparents and, despite his injuries, is not thought to have suffered any long-term problems. Rutter, who had been on bail, turned up for the start of his trial on January 20. But he failed to appear on Tuesday after the prosecution finished its case against him - and he has not been seen since. On Thursday a jury - who heard the incident was a ‘moment of madness’ - convicted Rutter in his absence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and cruelty to a child by wilful neglect. Texts: Rutter, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, went missing part-way through his trial at Bolton Crown. He sent a series of desperate text messages to the infant's mother, Samantha Harper, while babysitting . Today, Rutter was the subject of a . police man-hunt after Judge Timothy Clayson issued a warrant for his . arrest and said he would face six years and six months jail when he is . captured. Judge Clayson said: ‘The defendant had become increasingly frustrated with Jacob. ‘Medical . evidence in the case indicates that Jacob was significantly subjected . to a violent shaking that resulted in a serious injury to his brain.’ He added: ‘There is a trail of evidence via text messages that demonstrates what happened. ‘The . defendant didn’t take any steps to summon any medical help. He didn’t . reveal what he had done to his girlfriend. Samantha did contact the . walk-in centre but was not in a position to say what had happened. ‘The next day the baby was taken to a medical centre and then the hospital and received treatment some weeks thereafter. Judge Timothy Clayson sentenced Rutter to prison after the trial continued in his absence this week . ‘There is no up-to-date progress but his grandparents seem to be positive and it’s to be hoped that there are no serious long term problems.’ The incident occurred on May 13 2012 while Rutter, who has 22 previous convictions, but none relating to violence, was alone with Jacob. He became ‘frustrated’ with his son’s crying. Prosecutor Rob Hall said of the text messages: ‘It indicates that Rutter shook him in a manner that is beyond anything appropriate and then knowing what he had done, failed to do anything to assist the child in getting any sort of care. ‘These are the type of messages you might get from a parent who was losing their self-control and displaying increasing anger.’ Defence counsel Wayne Jackson, said: ‘While I concede there was a shaking injury at some point, I say the evidence does not support any shaking on the day in question.’ Ms Harper was cleared of child neglect at an earlier hearing after the prosecution discontinued proceedings against her.","Andrew Rutter, 28, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, went on the run part-way through his trial at Bolton Crown Court .

"By . William Turvill . A jewellery shop, believed to be the oldest in Britain, is facing closure after more than 300 years in business. Parsons the Jewellers opened its doors in Bristol in 1710 and was run by the same family for at least ten generations. But the shop's current owner, Paul Davis, 62, has said it is set to be closed because no one has shown any interest in taking it on from him. Mr Davis estimates that the 304-year-old shop has made more than 100,000 engagement rings over its history, providing more than half of those made in the South West city . He estimates that the 304-year-old shop has made more than 100,000 engagement rings over its history, providing more than half of those made in the South West city. ’It’s the oldest and one of the best known brands in Bristol and the public love our shop,' father-of-four Mr Davis said. ‘We have a ring in the window that was crafted in 1860, but I’m certain earlier pieces survive.’ Parsons the Jewellers (pictured) is facing closure after more than 300 years in business in Bristol . Its first shop in a Tudor building on Redcross Street in Bristol’s Old Market was founded in 1710 by George Edgecumbe who trained as a brass founder and then moved into clock-making. His son married Elizabeth Parsons and it was their son, George, who branched out into jewellery. The original shop remained for 250 . years until 1966 when it was demolished to make way for a roundabout and . the company moved to the Broadmead shopping centre. A second branch of the shop, which had opened in 1888, was devastated in a wartime blitz. In . 2006 the company moved to its current premises in the Galleries . Shopping Centre, but still kept its trademark statue of Cupid perched . above the shop front. Mr . Davis bought the company 15 years ago when the Parsons family ran out . of heirs - but he’s decided to sell up as he gets older. He said: ‘We are proud of our rich heritage. ‘The shop has seen wars, recession and many moves but it still attracts young couples to buy our trademark coloured diamonds.' Mr Davis is pictured here in his jewellery shop with two of employees, Chloe Slater (left) and Amy Stone . He added: ‘The business does very well, but obviously it could always do better - I’m just looking for someone to take over who has a good eye for a diamond in the rough. ‘I don’t think I could manage another busy Christmas but Parsons is such an institution, you could never let it die. ‘I feel like a caretaker here. The people of Bristol, I’m sure, would want to see it continue.’","Parsons the Jewellers opened its doors for the first time in Bristol in 1710 .

"By . William Turvill . A Nottinghamshire town believed to be the most ‘seismically active’ area in the UK has experienced more than 30 small earthquakes in the last 50 days. Geologists have said that mining in the area is likely to explain New Ollerton’s large number of tremors, which have had recorded magnitudes of up to 1.7. There have been 36 tremors recorded in New Ollerton since December 10, 2013. In this period, there have been a total of 49 around the British isles. New Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, has been the setting for 36 out of 49 tremors recorded across the British Isles in the last 50 days. The latest was recorded yesterday at 3am, with a magnitude of 1.5 . Shown here are the epicentres of earthquake activity around New Ollerton. The yellow circles show events since December 2013. The red circles show historical earthquake activity . In the last week alone, there have been five small earthquakes in the area, the last of which was recorded yesterday at 3am with a magnitude of 1.5. According to the BBC, UK Coal said the recent earthquakes could have been the result of mining at Thoresby Colliery. But the body said residents should not be concerned. The British Geological Survey said it is possible that all of the tremors in the area have originated from the same location. It also said that many of the tremors have been felt by local residents. The red circles on this map show mining seismicity alongside natural background earthquake activity . This graph shows the 36 earthquakes recorded in New Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, since December 10 . The BGS said: ‘Earthquakes of this size are not likely to cause any damage and the hazard from mining-induced seismicity in the UK is typically low.’ The body added that there have been no reports of structural damage from mining-induced earthquakes in the UK for 40 years and the maximum observed has had a magnitude of around three. Although the BGS said the tremors are not always detectable, one New Ollerton resident has complained of the damage they are causing. Yvonne Allwood has told how earthquakes in the New Ollerton area have caused damage in her home . Yvonne Allwood, who runs butcher ship S. Allwood & Son in the town, claims the tremors regularly send plant pots and pictures in her kitchen crashing to the floor. ‘I was baking in the kitchen and the next thing, everything fell off the shelf and I thought, “I bet that's been another earthquake”.’ However, she said she doesn't find the earthquakes scary: ‘I don't mind [them] at all. They're tiny things. 'I'm not about to be sucked into a hole. It's no big deal really.’ Earthquakes are usually the result of a slip along per-existing faults in the earth. According to the British Geological Survey, human activities, including mining, can change the state of stress near faults. Likely causes of changing stress are the ‘removal of sub-surface rock', or it can also be caused 'by the collapse of old mine workings, which can move the faults closer to failure and result in induced earthquakes’. The body says: ‘This process is only likely to affect faults within relatively small distances of the stress perturbation and mining induced earthquakes generally within of a few kilometres of the mining activity. ‘Similarly, sometimes the induced events occur shortly after the mining activity begins, but in other cases they happen long after it has ceased.’","Magnitudes of up to 1.7 have been recorded in the area since December 10 .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A heartwarming photo of three young girls from Oklahoma who are fighting cancer has inspired thousands of people after it went viral online. The picture, showing Rylie, 3, Rheann, 6, and Ainsley, 4, was taken by Lora Scantling to raise awareness of childhood cancer. It shows the girls, who had never met before the photo shoot, hugging as they unite in their battle to beat the disease. Bond: This beautiful image of three young cancer patients has touched the hearts of thousands of people . The owner of Scantling Photography in Bethany rallied the support of two children's clothing boutiques and Goodger Photography to provide everything she needed for the photo shoot. She said: 'I wanted to capture something that would speak a million words in a single portrait. Bringing awareness to childhood cancer holds a special place in my heart.' The cause is particular . poignant for Ms Scantling, whose stepfather Larry is fighting off stage 4 lung . cancer. Her close friend also lost her one-year-old to leukemia. The photographer has certainly achieved her aim, with the beautifully shot image under the banner 'Sometimes strength comes in knowing you are not alone'. Ms Scantling told Mail Online: 'When we took these photos I knew they would be a big hit because of what they represented but never in a million years would I have imagined all this. 'I am so deeply honored that so many around the world have wanted to share their story and that it is touching so many lives.' Connection: Rheann, left, and Ainsley, right, and the third model, Rylie, had never met before the photo shoot but soon became firm friends . She added: 'I can't tell you how many emails and messages I have received over the last few days just telling me how much the photo meant to them. 'It's a dream come true to have my photo be such an inspiration and to be reaching people all around the globe.' The young girls who posed for the photo had never met before but Ms Scantling said they quickly became good friends. On the Scantling Photography Facebook page she wrote: 'I have never met 3 more beautiful little girls in my life - full of spirit and so happy and strong.' The youngest of the girls, Rylie, has just beaten kidney cancer; Rheann is still battling the rare form of brain cancer she was diagnosed with; and Ainsley is in remission from leukemia. Fighting spirit: Three-year-old Rylie has beaten the kidney cancer she was suffering from . All smiles: Rylie before she found out she had cancer . Determined: Rheann, six, has a rare form of brain cancer . Strong: Rheann has had five brain surgeries since discovering she had cancer when she was four . Will to succeed: Four-year-old Ainsley, who has leukemia, refuses to let her illness stop her . Playful: Ainsley, pictured before cancer was diagnosed, is in remission for leukemia . Their families love the photos and have been overwhelmed by the reaction to them on social media. Rylie's mother, Bridget Hughes, told News 9: 'When you think of cancer, you typically think of adults of having cancer. I'm glad that people are seeing that there are a lot of kids out there struggling and fighting.' With the first set of picture being such a success Ms Scantling plans to use her talent to continue to raise awareness, and told Mail Online she can't wait to start her next project. More pictures and updates on the girls who featured in the images can be found on Facebook pages for Team Rylie and Ainsley Jane's Allies, and the Fight Like a Princess page for Rheann.","Rylie, Rheann and Ainsley are all fighting childhood cancers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Anna Edwards . and Andrew  Malone . Court documents from June 26 said Mandela 'is in a permanent vegetative state and is assisted in breathing by a life support machine' Nelson Mandela is being kept alive by a breathing machine and faces 'impending death,' court documents reveal. The former president's health is 'perilous,' according to documents filed in the court case that resulted in the remains of his three deceased children being reburied Thursday in their original graves. Court documents from June 26 said: 'The anticipation of his impending death is based on real and substantial grounds,' the court filing said. Mandela, who was hospitalized on June 8, remains in critical but stable condition, according to the office of President Jacob Zuma, who visited the anti-apartheid leader on Thursday. The South African presidency has denied that Mandela is in a 'vegetative state', and reiterated former statements that the beloved former leader is in a critical, but stable condition. The Presidency released a statement 'clarifying' Mandela's condition, Sky News reported. They said: 'We confirm our earlier statement released ... after President Jacob Zuma visited Madiba in hospital.' Mandela is under around-the-clock care of a team of nurses, the presidency said, hours after the sensational court reports were revealed. The documents read: They say the condition of the country’s first black president is ‘perilous’. ‘The anticipation of his impending death is based on real and substantial grounds,’ they add. Scroll down for videos . Claims: Explosive allegations were made today by Nelson Mandela's grandson  Mandla Mandela who called a press conference to reveal what he claims are the reasons behind the family's squabbling . Removal: The coffin of one of Nelson Mandela's children is brought to a burial site at former South African President's compound in Qunu . A TiTi hearse carrying the remains of Nelson Mandela's three children can be seen driving along . Return: Following a court case which granted Mandela's family the right to relocate the remains to Qunu, the remains were returned . The legal papers relate to a bitter legal battle between rival family factions over where Mr Mandela should be buried. After examining him last week, the . doctors wrote: ‘He is in a permanent vegetative state and is assisted in . breathing by a life support machine.’ Medically, this means he is unresponsive and in a state between coma and death. ‘He’s basically gone,’ said Charlene Smith, Mr Mandela’s authorised biographer. The statements come as the remains of the 94-year-old's . three deceased children were reburied at their original resting site . following a court order to return them after Mandla moved the bodies. It comes as the feud between Mandela's family descended into soap opera farce today when his grandson and heir Mandla accused relatives of adultery and milking the fame of the revered anti-apartheid leader. In a news conference broadcast live on . TV that stunned South Africans, Mandla confirmed rumours that his young . son, Zanethemba, was in fact the child of an illicit liaison between . his brother Mbuso and Mandla's now ex-wife Anais Grimaud. With Mandela on life-support in a . Pretoria hospital, the escalating feud has transfixed and appalled South . Africa in equal measure.

Centre of tension: Ndaba Mandela, centre, grandson of  former South African President Nelson Mandela walks with family members today . Checking: A police man provides security as the  hearse carrying the remains arrives in Qunu . 'Mbuso impregnated my wife,' Mandla . said in Mvezo, the Eastern Cape village 700 km (450 miles) south of . Johannesburg where Mandela was . born and where Mandla serves as the formal chief of the clan. Mandla, 39, first raised questions . about his son's paternity last year when he split from French-speaking . Grimaud, who has since moved back home to the Indian Ocean island of . Reunion. He also revealed then that he was unable to have children. His attempts to get the family to . address the questions of Zanethemba's paternity had been rebuffed in the . interests of preserving a semblance of unity in South Africa's most . famous family, Mandla said. 'This matter has never been discussed . by the so-called members of the family who say that they want to ensure . there is harmony in this family,' he said, challenging reporters to . conduct DNA tests to confirm his allegations. 'The facts are there. You may go and . find out, do the necessary tests that are needed,' he said. His brother . Mbuso has denied being the father of the child. Newspapers have plastered 'Mandela vs. Mandela' headlines across their front pages and editorials have . bemoaned the cruel irony of bitter divisions inside the family of a man . lauded the world over as the epitome of reconciliation between races. The government said that Mandela remained 'critical but stable' after nearly four weeks in hospital. The sleepy community of Mvezo, set . amid the rolling hills of the Eastern Cape, has been at the centre of a . vicious dispute that may ultimately determine where South Africa's first . black president will be laid to rest. Update: Graca Machel spoke about her husband's condition at a fundraising drive for a children's hospital that will be named after the 94-year-old anti-apartheid leader . United: 'Whatever is the outcome of his stay in hospital, that will remain the second time where he offered his nation an opportunity to be united under the banner of our flag, under the banner of our constitution,' she said . Two years ago, Mandla exhumed the . bodies of three of Mandela's children from Qunu, where Mandela grew up, . and moved them the 20 km to Mvezo, where Mandla has built a visitor . centre and a memorial centre dedicated to his grandfather. Mandla said he moved the bodies based . on his right as chief to decide the final resting place of family . members, especially his father Makgatho who died of an AIDS-related . illness in 2005. 'I hold the right to determine where . he is buried. I am the chief of Mvezo, as a traditional leader and the . head of the royal house of Mandela,' said Mandla, dressed in a black . leather jacket and red shirt. Despite his assertions, many of South . Africa's 53 million people believe the exhumations were part of a . deliberate plan to ensure Mandela was buried in Mvezo. Last week, a rival faction of the . family, led by Mandla's aunt Makaziwe and including Mbuso, won a court . order for the bodies to be returned to Qunu - an edict carried out late . on Wednesday after a last-minute legal bid by Mandla failed. Speaking calmly and deliberately in . front of a bank of cameras, Mandla lashed out at Makaziwe and members of . the wider family, accusing them of trying to cash in on the legacy of . one of the 20th century's most respected political figures. The former wife of Nelson Mandela, Winnie Mandela Madikizela, arrives at the Mediclinic Heart Hospital where former South African President Nelson Mandela is being hospitalized . Visits: Mandela, who was hospitalized on June 8, remains in critical but stable condition, according to a statement today by President Jacob Zuma's office.  Zuma visited Mandela yesterday . 'This is the very family that has . taken their own father, their own grandfather, to court for his monies,' he said, referring to a long-running legal bid by Makaziwe to remove . the guardians of a Mandela charitable trust. 'It seems like anyone and everyone can . come and say 'I am a Mandela' and demand to be part of the . decision-making in this family,' he said. 'Individuals have abandoned . their own families and heritage and decided to jump on the Mandela . wagon.' Makaziwe has declined to comment on the graves dispute, telling reporters that it is a 'private family matter'. The three Mandela children exhumed . from Mvezo are an infant girl who died in 1948, a boy, Thembi, who died . in a car crash in 1969, and Mandla's father, Makgatho. In all, Mandela . fathered six children from his three marriages. Today family members and community elders attended a ceremony on the Mandela property that included the singing of hymns. Bailiffs break down gates to the home of Nelson Mandela's grandson Mandla after a court ordered bodies secretly moved their be exhumed and returned to the family plot . Mandla Mandela had refused to cooperate with the court order, forcing bailiffs to act in Mvezo . Mandla was accused of trying to cash in on his grandfather's eventual death by moving the bodies two years ago . The reburial took place in Qunu, Mandela's hometown and the place the former president has said he wants to be buried. Forensic tests earlier confirmed the remains were those of Mandela's children. The . bitter family feud comes as Mandela remains in critical condition . nearly a month after being hospitalized for a recurring lung infection. A Mandela family court affidavit, obtained by the Mail and Guardian . newspaper, said Mandela is on life support in the form of a breathing . respirator. Mandla Mandela - the oldest male Mandela heir and a tribal chief - told a news conference on Thursday that 'my grandfather like myself would be highly disappointed in what is unraveling.' Meanwhile, Mandela's wife said the former president is sometimes uncomfortable but seldom in pain while being treated in a hospital. Graca Machel spoke about her husband's condition at a fundraising drive for a children's hospital that will be named after the 94-year-old anti-apartheid leader. 'Whatever is the outcome of his stay in hospital, that will remain the second time where he offered his nation an opportunity to be united under the banner of our flag, under the banner of our constitution,' she said. Mandela, who was hospitalized on June 8, remains in critical but stable condition, according to a statement today by President Jacob Zuma's office. Zuma visited Mandela Thursday, said the statement. Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years during white racist rule and was freed in 1990 before being elected president in all-race elections. He won the Nobel Peace Prize along with former President F.W. de Klerk.","Mandela needs a life support machine to help breathe, documents say .

"By . Luke Garratt . These amazing pictures show life on board the Royal Navy ship working around the clock in the southern Indian Ocean in the hunt for missing flight MH370 and its back box. The captain of survey ship HMS Echo said the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight is proving 'challenging', but that the crew are working 24/7 to help the search efforts. Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board, sparking an international effort to find out what happened to it. Survey ship HMS Echo, as a Lockheed P-3 Orion flies overhead, in the southern Indian Ocean helping in the underwater search for the flight recorder from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . Hydrographic survey ship HMS Echo was diverted from its work in the Indian Ocean to help in the hunt, and arrived on Thursday in the area of the southern Indian Ocean where 'pings' thought to be from the missing plane had been detected. According to Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, the search area has been significantly narrowed down in the hunt for the 'ping' signals which authorities are confident are from the missing jet. However, he said the signal from the Boeing 777's flight data and cockpit voice recorders is fading - batteries powering their locator beacons last only about a month and it has been more than a month since the plane disappeared. The ship has been diverted from its regular duties to assist in the search for the missing plane since 'pings' were heard coming from the ocean earlier this month . The 'pings' were possibly emitted by the Malaysia flight's black box, which puts a strict time limit on the search, as the black box only has about a month of battery power, and has been missing for a month already . Working alongside ships and aircraft from seven other nations, the two Royal Navy vessels face the same race against time to find the black box flight recorder . Australian vessel Ocean Shield, which is towing a US Navy device to detect signals from the beacons, first picked up two underwater sounds consistent with the 'pings' a week ago, followed by two more in the same general area on Tuesday. Those involved in the search are trying to pinpoint the location of the source of the signals so they can send down a robotic submersible to look for wreckage and the flight recorders. HMS Echo, whose specialist equipment has been specially adapted to pick up sonar pings from the jet's missing black box, is supporting Ocean Shield by understanding the signals it is picking up, its commanding officer said. Crew of the HMS Echo, Kev Rail and Stephen Boyd, prepare the ship's Undulating Oceanographic Recorder for deployment . Speaking from the ship today, Commander Phillip Newell said they are working in conditions after inclement weather caused difficulties interpreting signals picked up underwater. He said: 'It's been challenging. Over the last couple of days we have been conducting oceanographic observations to support Ocean Shield. 'The key thing is to help their understanding of what is going on, and how it is affecting the ocean column.' He said there had been some difficult weather conditions which had 'messed up' the water column, making it hard to understand some signals being picked up. Sailors from HMS Echo prepare one of the ship's CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) probes for launch into the southern Indian Ocean . He said: 'The key challenge is to try and refine all of the observations they are making. They are doing that at the moment but it's challenging. 'Looking out of the window right now, what we are seeing is Ocean Shield to the south of us conducting further observations. 'She is trying to get in a position so she can then observe on the seabed, and then through the water column, the pings from the black box, which involves physically moving the ship.' He said another challenge is directing Australian navy P-3 Orion aircraft which drop sound-locating buoys, each dangling a hydrophone listening device about 1,000 feet below the surface, into the water. With its fuel and food supplies, the ship has the capacity to travel half way around the world in a single journey . Cdr Newell said he and his crew are conscious of the importance of their task and need to refine the search area while the black box's signal can still be detected. 'At this stage it's a challenge trying to refine this position so that when they put a submersible into the water they will be in a position where they can identify what is on the seabed correctly. 'We have got to give them the best advantage we can and within that they will get to the position where they have the best refined position that they can search. 'In anything like this I am very conscious, I have 20 years experience of trying to find things on the seabed, it's pretty much my day job. The ship is designed for long stays at sea, and could potentially continue its search for up to 60 days . 'I have a brilliant team, young, bright and enthusiastic and we are working 24/7 to cover the sea bed and observe on the surface. 'There's a sense that we are playing an important part in this role and we are keen to get it right. 'In terms of purpose, it's key to make sure that we detect anything that can help in the investigation.' Before arriving in the latest search area HMS Echo had already searched 6,000 square miles of ocean - an area 10 times the size of Greater London - 1,000 miles north-west of Perth with Chinese vessels after sensors picked up a possible signal earlier this month. Also aiding Australian vessel Ocean Shield in the search effort is the U.K nuclear submarine HMS Tireless . The was gathering data on her way from Oman to the Seychelles when she was diverted to join the international search for the Malaysia Airlines plane. Apart from a 12-hour stop in the Maldives to take on supplies and change some of her crew, the survey ship has now been at sea continuously for six weeks. Cdr Newell said: 'We are a ship that's designed and built to operate for long periods at sea. 'We can carry provisions for 60 days at sea, and fuel to go pretty much halfway round the world' He added that the ship would carry on helping with the search, providing as much support as it could to Ocean Shield, with help from British nuclear submarine HMS Tireless, until its tasking is reviewed later in the month.","The survey ship was called off regular duty to help aid the search .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 09:50 EST, 17 June 2011 . Crunch time: Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou is facing fears his government will default on its debt . Britain will not fund a second EU bail out of Greece, a Government official in Brussels said today. The spokesman said any help for the Mediterranean country - which is on the verge of defaulting on its debt - should be funded by eurozone countries only. That was the case when the EU stepped in to prop up the Athens regime with a £95billion loan last year, but the crippled Greek economy had raised fears that other countries could be asked to help avert financial disaster. Experts warn any default by Greece could trigger a Lehman Brothers-style credit crisis. Germany and France have already signalled there is no reason for London to pay a share of any repeat bail-out. And in Brussels a UK Government official commented: 'The UK is of the view that the Greek problem is to do with the eurozone. 'The original problem was resolved with bilateral loans, put together for Greece last May and it is appropriate that only those involved in the original bail-out should be involved - the UK will not be involved.' There was a 'theoretical risk', he said, that if a second bail-out package were agreed, some may want to use a bail-out fund set up after the Greek crisis last year, which involves contributions from all EU countries. But he added: 'We do not get the benefits of the euro, as we are not members, so we should not be involved (in a bail-out).' And ahead of talks between EU finance . ministers Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'I . don't want to speculate on what might happen. 'There is no proposition on the table on this and we are not part of those arrangements, those bilateral arrangements.' EU eurozone finance ministers are due to agree next week on the latest payment from the 110 billion euro (£96.5 billion) Greek bail-out approved in May last year. Protests: Thousands of Greeks took to the streets again yesterday to vent their anger against the austerity measures . And they are also under pressure to settle the terms of a second bail-out, following the failure of existing Greek austerity measures to revive the economy and close the Greek national deficit gap. Chancellor George Osborne will be attending the talks in Luxembourg, but he will expect Germany and France to stick to their public acknowledgement that the issue does not involve the UK. On the eve of the talks, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou today reshuffled his cabinet and tried to calm public opposition to further austerity measures which he must push through his Parliament as the price of any further bail-out involving the eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund. The stumbling block is a clash between Germany and France, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisting that any repeat bail-out must involve private bondholders taking a share of the financial risk of propping up the Greek economy. Insistent: German Chancellor Angela Merkel says a repeat bail-out must involve private bondholders taking a share of the financial risk . France, backed by the European Central Bank, says that would amount to a 'selective default' by Greece - with dire consequences for market speculation about the longer-term consequences for the credibility of the euro currency. A senior official at the bank yesterday warned the bailout fund could soar to 1.5trillion euros, equal to more than £1.1trillion. This week the IMF approved an emergency £10billion payment to the Greek government to enable it to pay its bills next month. The warning came as world stock markets hit a three-month low and the euro tumbled amid growing fears a Greek default could force other struggling economies to follow, and spark a fresh global economic crisis. Neil Mackinnon, an economist at VTB Capital in London and a former Treasury official, said: ‘The probability of a Eurozone Lehman moment is increasing. ‘The markets have moved from simply pricing in a high probability of a Greek debt default to looking at a scenario of it becoming disorderly and of contagion spreading to other economies like Portugal, like Ireland, and maybe Spain, Italy and Belgium.’ European's economic affairs commissioner Olli Rehn has warned there must be decisions at a meeting of EU finance ministers on July 11, if not earlier - and in the meantime Mr Papandreou, if he holds on to power, must deliver Greek Parliament agreement on further austerity measures. This afternoon European Commission . President Jose Manuel Barroso urged Greece to play its part in creating . conditions for another bail-out:'I . hope the new Greek government can be approved rapidly so that the . process for continuation of financial assistance to Greece may continue . smoothly. 'I look to . eurozone ministers on Sunday to resolve remaining differences and come . to a responsible agreement on financial assistance to Greece. 'Greece . must also do its part. I am confident that leaders in Greece and in . Europe will rise to the challenge and act with responsibility.' Last night former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said it was ‘double or quits time’ for Greece and the euro. Demand: John Redwood, left, and Douglas . Carswell said that Greece should be allowed to default on its debts . after warnings the bailout could cost £1trillion . He said France and Germany would . either have to bail out the struggling economy, or allow Greece to leave . the single currency and risk its collapse. Mr . Redwood said the ‘simple and best’ solution would be for Greece and . other struggling countries to quit the euro. But he said that whatever . solution was agreed, British taxpayers’ money should not be involved. Fellow Tory Douglas Carswell said defaulting was now the ‘least worst thing’ for Greece to do. He . said it would be ‘totally unacceptable’ for more British money to be . used in a vain attempt to prop up Greece or other struggling Eurozone . countries. Mr Carswell . said membership of the euro was limiting Greece’s options and likened . its situation to the Black Wednesday debacle in which Britain was forced . to quit Europe’s Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. The Greeks are revolting, the euro is tumbling and the talk is of economic meltdown across Europe - it's Groundhog Day all over again... Why are we in another Greek crisis over the euro? - Actually it's the same crisis, exacerbated by the failure of national austerity measures to revive the Greek economy. That is why the Greek prime minister is trying to form a new government, win a vote of confidence and get his people to tighten their belts even more. Wasn't this sorted out when the European Union and the International Monetary Fund first agreed a bail-out package last year? - In theory, but the economic cuts Greece introduced as a condition for getting the bail-out have failed to deliver the necessary deficit reduction and now Europe is facing the prospect of another bail-out. But in return for another bail-out won't Greece have to agree even more belt-tightening? Exactly, which is why Greeks are revolting over the threat of more tax hikes, pay cuts and job losses, and why the euro is weakening again under speculative pressure. Is there any point throwing more money at the Greeks? Sadly, yes: it's not just a question of bailing out the Greeks but limiting ""contagion"" to other eurozone countries and restoring market confidence in the single currency. Isn't that what everyone said last time? Yes, and it's even more urgent now, but this time there's a rumpus among EU nations about how to do it. Germany, backed by the Finns and Austria, and the International Monetary Fund, wants Greece's private creditors to share some of the burden by extending their credit lines to Greece. But others, led by France, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary say that would amount to a dreaded ""default"" by Greece, and hit the euro really hard. Who is right? It depends which economic model you favour as the way to restore the fortunes of the Greek economy and the euro more widely. No-one has the perfect solution, and nobody has got it right in this economic crisis so far. What happens next? A lot: the next slice of the original 110 billion euro (£96.5 billion) Greek bail-out is due to be agreed by eurozone countries on Sunday, with the IMF (which contributes a share) wanting to see what new longer-term plans the EU has for propping up Greece. Then a second bail-out package for the Greeks should be agreed at more talks on July 11. And what about Greece? The Greek government - whatever government and whoever leads it - must get another economic reform programme through parliament in the face of mounting public opposition, preferably by the end of this month. It's a tall order isn't it? It always was, and as much hangs on market perceptions about the state of the eurozone as the reality. The fact is that gossip about Greece falling out of the euro and returning to the drachma is not being ridiculed as much as it was a year ago.","Greece is the eurozone's problem, insists spokesman .

The top temperature predicted this Easter weekend for the north is 15C on Sunday - again well above the average of 10C for this time of year. In comparison, Greece's capital city will be just 16C on Sunday - with lows of 14C in the week. Meanwhile, Rome in Italy will be wet and 9C on Easter Sunday and the French capital Paris clear but just 11C.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is home to fascinating creatures, but few divers get to see the secret movements of corals. Now one scientist has used time-lapse photography to capture the mysterious movement of corals beneath the waves. Pim Bongaerts’ photographic labour of love reveals the life cycle of a coral reef, which happens too slowly for humans to see. Scroll down for video . A mushroom coral flipping over took six hours to film and was sped up 900 times for the video, which captures the mysterious movements of corals beneath the waves . The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands. It covers an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres (133,000 square miles). The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia. It can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. The reef structure is composed of billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority considers the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef to be climate change, causing ocean warming which increases coral bleaching. Mass coral bleaching events due to elevated ocean temperatures occurred in the summers of 1998, 2002 and 2006 and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence. The Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest living organism and is thought to be especially sensitive to slight fluctuations – and a gradual warming – in sea temperatures. Dr Bongaerts, of University of Queensland's Global Change Institute, documented the colourful coral creatures over a five year period. He has captured the communication, movement and even violent battles that the slow-moving creatures become involved in, the BBC reported. The location of the photographic shoot . was Heron Island and a short clip of a planting coral removing sediment . took 11.5 hours to film and was sped up 1,800 times in a . video displayed on his website. The . intriguing sight of a mushroom coral flipping itself over is included . in the video and took six hours to film, before being sped up 900 times, . while footage of starfish and nudibranch coral moving took two hours before it was . sped up 300 times. Pim Bongaerts’ photographic labour of love reveals the life cycle of a coral reef and movement of the strange creatures, which happens too slowly for humans to see . Scientists have previously warned that the world's largest coral reef - under threat from Australia's surging coal and gas shipments, climate change and a destructive starfish - is declining faster than ever and coral cover could fall to just 5 per cent in the next decade. Researchers from the Australian . Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in the north eastern city of . Townsville, said Australia's Great Barrier Reef has lost half of its coral . in little more than a generation  and the pace of damage has picked up . since 2006. Globally, . reefs are being assailed by myriad threats, particularly rising sea . temperatures, increased ocean acidity and more powerful storms, but the . threat to the Great Barrier Reef is even more pronounced, the AIMS study . found. Dr Bongaerts documented the colourful coral . creatures over a five year period and captured the communication, movement and even violent battles between the slow-moving creatures . AIMS scientists studied data from more than 200 individual reefs off the Queensland coast covering the period 1985-2012. They found cyclone damage caused . nearly half the losses, crown-of-thorns starfish more than 40 per cent . and coral bleaching from spikes in sea temperatures 10 per cent. The starfish are native and prey on the reefs, but plagues are occurring much more frequently. Ordinarily, . reefs can recover within 10 to 20 years from storms, bleachings or . starfish attacks but climate change impacts slow this down. Rising . ocean acidification caused by seas absorbing more carbon dioxide is . disrupting the ability of corals to build their calcium carbonate . structures and hotter seas stress corals still further.

"By . Dan Bloom . Urine the clear: Despite being filmed urinating into his colleagues' kettle, police say Gao committed no crime as he is free of disease . Four female nursery teachers who were suspicious about their strange-smelling tea trained a hidden camera on their thermos flasks - and discovered a cigarette-smoking colleague was urinating in them. Chinese police arrested 54-year-old Gao Chao and took him to hospital where he was tested for infectious diseases. But they say the teacher at Dongsheng Art Kingergarten, in the north eastern city of Lianyungang, committed no crime because he has a clean bill of health so his actions caused no harm. The four women aged between 21 and 26 complained to police after saying they had discovered the reason why their tea smelt strange. They set up a hidden camera in one of the classrooms and saw that the kindergarten's only male teacher had been relieving himself into their thermos flasks. The man reportedly felt his female colleagues did not respect him enough, and was bitter at being passed over for the job of kindergarten boss. But teacher Li Kao, 26, one of the four, said she was furious that police had simply given the man nothing more than a stern lecture and a warning not to do it again. She said: 'I first noticed there was a strange smell from my tea a few weeks ago after I returned to the class after taking the children out to play in the playground. 'The cups are not transparent, so it was hard to see if the liquid looked strange but there was certainly a strange smell which also came from the thermos flasks that the tea was stored in. 'I changed the flask and bought a new one but once I brought it to the kindergarten again I had the same problem with the strange smell. Flushed out: One of the four teachers lays the trap before her colleague wanders into the room unawares . Teaching a-cistern-t: Watching the footage, the horrified women finally realised why their tea was smelling odd . The perfect grime: The man zips up and walks away, not knowing police would soon swoop on the school . 'Eventually I discovered that my three colleagues had the same problem, and we thought perhaps somebody was putting something in the water.' The women complained to kindergarten boss Qiu Li Shih, 37, who advised them to put a camera in the room. So they activated the camera on a mobile phone and put it in a basket filled with children's toys. The video showed the man, who appeared to . be smoking a cigarette, picking up one of the women's brand new pink . flasks and holding it close over his genitals while he contaminated her . morning drink. All four women refused to return to work if their colleague was not sacked. However, the stand-off was resolved when he agreed to pay around Â£200 to each of the women, apologised, and promised not to do it again. Pointing the finger: One of the teachers singles out the pink thermos flask at the scene of the non-crime .

"By . William Turvill . A ‘fat fingered’ City of London trader could have lost up to £400,000 in just 30 seconds after accidentally buying shares in HSBC. The share price of Britain’s largest bank rose by more than 10 per cent after yesterday's trade, leading to a suspension of its shares for five minutes. According to reports, the estimated loss occurred because the trade was not spread over a long enough period – meaning HSBC was vulnerable to a sudden drop in share price. A City trader accidentally lost up to £400,000 in 30 seconds after buying shares in HSBC (stock picture) Shares in the bank shot up from 630p to 688p seconds after the blunder. They then closed at 630.2p. The spike briefly pushed the FTSE 100 into the positive, although it closed down 5.83 points at the end of the day at 6,538.45. A London Stock Exchange spokesman confirmed that FTSE 100 circuit breakers suspended HSBC shares when 'price thresholds were breached'. The London Stock Exchange said . the activity was valid and that no trades were cancelled following an investigation. HSBC . declined to comment on the 'fat finger trade'. In seconds, shares in the bank shot up from 630p to 688p before closing at 630.2p . According to Reuters, traders blamed the trade on human error – . a ‘fat finger’ trade. The identity of the trader and the company they . work for has not been revealed. A ‘fat finger’ trade was also blamed for an 11 per cent drop in Diageo’s share price yesterday.

"By . Becky Barrow . and Hugo Duncan . A record 3,100 people every day are finding work as Britain’s jobless total falls at the fastest rate in 17 years. The number of unemployed tumbled to 2.32million – falling by 167,000 between September and November, the biggest drop since 1997. Yesterday the Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate is now at 7.1 per cent after falling faster than any economist or the Bank predicted. A record 3,100 people every day are finding work as Britain's jobless total falls at the fastest rate in 17 years . But the Bank of England insisted interest rates are not on the brink of their first rise in nearly seven years despite governor Mark Carney saying it would consider raising rates if the jobless rate fell to 7 per cent. In an unusually political statement, the Bank also said the Coalition’s benefits clampdown may have pushed more people into looking for work, rather than continuing to rely on State handouts. It said: ‘A tightening in the eligibility requirements for some State benefits might also have led to an intensification of job search.’ The number of people claiming the dole plunged by more than 300,000 people over the last year, the biggest annual drop in Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants since 1998. There are now just 1.25million people on JSA, the lowest figure since January 2009 – and there are enough job vacancies for half of them to find work. Overall, the ONS said an extra . 280,000 people started working between September and November, raising . the workforce to an all-time high of 30.2million. Of . all the jobs created, eight in ten were full-time positions, reversing a . long-term trend of workers forced to accept part-time jobs. With inflation at its target of 2 per cent, the Bank said it sees ‘no immediate need to raise bank rates even if the 7 per cent unemployment threshold were to be reached in the near future’. Esther McVey said young people should be prepared to work in places such as coffee shops rather than expecting their dream job immediately . The base rate was cut to 0.5 per cent in March 2009 and has remained at this level – the lowest in the Bank’s 320-year history – ever since. For the first time, the Bank also said any increase in the base rate will be slow and steady, rather than a rapid rise back to more normal levels. At a speech in Nottingham yesterday, Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank’s committee, said the 7 per cent figure has always been ‘only a threshold, not a trigger.’ John Cridland, director general of business lobby group the CBI, said: ‘Now is not the time to raise interest rates.’ Yesterday David Cameron hailed the employment figures as evidence the Government’s austerity drive is working, but added there should ‘not be one ounce of complacency’. He said: ‘We are securing Britain’s future and it would be put at risk by Labour’. The Prime Minister called on Labour leader Ed Miliband to apologise for ‘the mess you left us’  Mr Cameron said: ‘You are like an arsonist who goes around setting fire after fire and then complains when the fire brigade aren’t putting out the fires fast enough.’ The figures cast fresh doubt on Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls’s view in October 2011 that it is ‘a complete fantasy’ the private sector could mop up the public sector jobs cull. Since May 2010, the private sector has grown to a record 24.4million, equal to more than 80 per cent of the country’s workforce.","A record number of people - 3,100 - every day are finding work in Britain .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The U.S. transport police have released a shocking list of weapons confiscated from passengers trying to board planes in the past year. The deadly haul of weapons, from maces and fake suicide vests, to an assortment of concealed guns and knives, was listed in the annual review of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Officers discovered the assortment of guns and knives as they screened 638,705,790 passengers at airports across the U.S. Concealed: The TSA confiscated an average of five guns a day at airports across the U.S. last year . Sharp: A selection of ninja stars and other jagged objects taken from passengers in 2013 . Unexpected: A bazooka round that was found inside a bag . Guns were the most frequently confiscated item, with 1,813 firearms - roughly five a day - found during passenger checks at 205 airports. More worryingly, the TSA said that in about 80 per cent of cases, the guns were loaded. The largest number were found at Atlanta's international airport, with Dallas/Fort Worth International coming in second, according to the Huffington Post. In one case officers found a .380 pistol, loaded with eight rounds, that had been strapped to the lower leg of a passenger. At Boston Logan airport, an alarm on a checked bag alerted officers to a disassembled 30-30 rifle concealed in the bag lining. When they ran checks on the serial number they discovered it had been stolen. A shotgun was also found in a checked golf bag in Detroit, and seven undeclared firearms were found in a toolbox in Miami. Concern: A suicide vest found in a checked bag. Officers discovered it was inactive and belonged to an explosives instructor . Stunned: This selection of stun and smoke grenades were also confiscated . Medieval: A wood and metal mace was found at a Chicago airport . As well as guns, passengers were also found to have stun guns, shock grenades, flare guns, inert demolition devices and, in one case, a Second World War bazooka, in their carry on bags. At Chicago's Midway International, TSA officials even found a medieval wood and metal mace. Often seemingly innocent looking items such as pens, combs and walking stalks were found to conceal an array of knives and swords. And cigarette packets and lipsticks were used to try to conceal stun guns and pepper spray. The discovery of a suicide vest shocked one group of officers. It was found to be deactivated and belonged to an explosives instructor. Alarming: Pictured above are just some of the knives and blades taken off passengers by security staff . No joke: Clockwise from top left, a bow, finger spikes, a bang stick, gun-shaped alarm clock, stun knuckles, a fake bomb and a BB machine gun were all confiscated . One of the most bizarre finds however, was fragments of a human skull that were discovered inside clay pots in a checked bag. The owners of the pots said they had no idea the pieces of bone were inside. The discovery caused delays at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International in Florida as officers investigated. Hobbled: A selection of walking canes, used to conceal swords, is pictured . Chilling: Parts of a human skull were found inside a clay pot much to the surprise of officers and the owners . Explosive: A selection of blast equipment removed from bags . Danger: One of the many loaded guns removed from passengers.

"By . Damien Gayle . North Korea has taken a bite of Apple cool with its own state-backed smartphone - which appears to be a rip off of the iPhone 3. Sold in three colours, the so-called 'Pyongyang Touch' appears to be a clear copy of the ageing Apple gadget - except with a few localised alterations. Basically, don't expect a flood of Instagram photos of young clubbers partying in Pyongyang, since the pariah state's strict censorship laws mean phones marketed in the country can't call overseas and have no Internet. The 'Pyongyang Touch': The must have accessory for every hip young North Korean worker . Nevertheless, the number of mobile phone users in North Korea has been steadily increasing since the communist dictatorship's first 3G network was introduced in 2008, NK News reports. By May last year, it was estimated that two million North Koreans now carry mobiles - which, as leaks by the U.S. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden have revealed, are effective tools for surveillance. No details of the devices' technical specifications have been published, but pictures published by pro-North Korean Japanese outlet Choson Sinbo suggest it is running a modified version of Google's Android operating system. The genuine article: The iPhone 3GS seems to be the inspiration behind the Pyongyang Touch, which observers say is a remodelled Chinese product . It is unclear whether the phones - available in in pink, navy blue and white - are actually being made in North Korea. State-run media announced last August that the country had begun making a smartphone called the 'Arirang' using home-grown technology. But photographs of the country's portly young leader, Kim Jong Un, visiting the factory apparently making the phones raised suspicions that the mobiles were merely Chinese imports rebranded for the North Korean market. Mobile tech website GSM Insider reported last week published a photographs comparing the Arirang phone with the Chinese-made Uniscope U1201 that appeared to confirm that suspicion. 'Both devices are 97 per cent similar except the brand, the network support and the operating system,' a reporter for GSM Insider wrote. 'The logo of Uniscope was replaced by the Arirang logo in the Korean language while the network support as well as the OS must be modified based on the regulations in North Korea before official release.' Despite apparently having managed to build its own nuclear weapons, isolated North Korea lags well behind its Asian neighbours in technology. Crash landings of suspected North Korean drones in South Korean in recent weeks have revealed they are little more than remote-controlled toy aeroplanes equipped with consumer-grade cameras available for just a few hundred pounds.","North Korean mobile phones can't call overseas and have no Internet .

"By . Becky Barrow . The number of people having to submit tax returns has soared to a record high of 10.7million thanks to the Government’s controversial changes to child benefit. For the first time, hundreds of thousands of parents who have never had to fill in a self-assessment tax form have been caught in a system that many struggle to understand. HMRC warned nearly 100,000 parents are at . risk of a fine of 100 per cent of the amount of child benefit that they . have received but are no longer entitled to keep. HM Revenue and Customs said record numbers of parents are being forced to fill in a tax return every year . For a parent with three children, this could result in a fine of up to £612, or £438 if they have two children or £263 for parents with one child. In January last year, around 1.1million parents lost all or some of their eligibility for child benefit after the Government controversially changed the rules. If one or both parents earn more than £60,000, they lost the benefit entirely, while those earning more than £50,000 and up to £60,000 lost some of the benefit on a sliding scale. If they have continued to receive the benefit - which they are allowed to do - they must pay back the amount of money that they are no longer eligible to receive through self-assessment. HMRC said around 461,000 parents opted to stop receiving child benefit while others have registered, or were already registered, for self-assessment. HMRC warned nearly 100,000 parents are at risk of a fine of 100 per cent of the amount of child benefit that they have received . But there are still 'just below 100,000' parents who are yet to register for self-assessment, an HMRC spokesman said yesterday. The deadline for filing their tax return for the 2012/2013 tax year to repay their child benefit was Friday 31 January. They will not be fined the standard £100 penalty for missing the deadline, but will instead be hit by a 'failure to notify' penalty because they have not registered for self-assessment. Parents should have paid back the amount that they received between 7 January 2013 - when the rules were changed - and 5 April 2013 - the last day of the tax year. Robin Williamson, from the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said HMRC had chosen a 'complicated and odd' way of clawing back the money from parents. He called for HMRC to show leniency towards parents, many of whom will be confused by the new system or not even aware of it. Mr Williamson said: 'I think it would be inappropriate for HMRC to levy the full penalties in this first year until people have really got their head around the situation.' HMRC said it will be writing to all of the 100,000 parents to warn them of the urgent need to complete their tax return. The quicker they register for self-assessment, the less likely they are to be hit by a 'failure to notify' penalty, HMRC said. There were 30 million taxpayers in 2012/2013. HMRC said 10.03million people filed a tax return before deadline day of a total of 10.74million who need to complete one. The busiest time was on deadline day when 569,847 people filed their tax return, but 1,566 also found the time on Christmas Day to send an online tax return. The number of people who have to complete a tax return has been increasing rapidly, rising by around 1.4million since the 2006/07 tax year. In a sign of the rise of the internet, just 38,000 filed their tax return online in 2001, compared to 8.5million for the most recent tax year. A tax return must be completed by people who owe money to the tax man, typically the self-employed and those with additional earnings or income on top of their main job.","Parents caught in a tax system many struggle to understand .

"By . Becky Barrow . and Daniel Martin . Promise: The prime minister has vowed to find a long-term reform for the notoriously complex charging system . Britain's most hated business tax, which costs firms around £24billion a year, will be fundamentally reformed, the Prime Minister claimed yesterday. David Cameron said he totally understands the anger and resentment created by business rates, the corporate equivalent of council tax. Speaking at the Federation of Small Businesses conference in London yesterday, he said: ‘I think we do need to look at longer term reform. ‘It is not going to be easy because rates raise whatever it is about £24billion and I don’t think there is any one solution that is going to make everybody happy. ‘But I think we’ve got to start addressing this issue, particularly this issue about internet retailing and high-street retailing.’ Mr Cameron said he agreed with Mike Cherry, the federation’s national policy chairman, who had asked what the Tory leader plans to do about business rates during yesterday’s conference. Mr Cherry said: ‘Day in, day out, our members are still telling us that this is the biggest problem that they face going forwards. Will you finally tackle this by looking at how you could ensure a complete reform occurs?’ Speaking after the conference, Mr Cherry, a woodworking engineer by trade, slammed business rates as ‘a tax which is not fit for purpose in the 21st-century’. The business rate charging system, which is notoriously complicated, involves the Valuation Office Agency setting the ‘per square metre’ charge for a premises, such as a shop. This rate is then submitted to the local council which decides how much will be charged in business rates, subject to various reliefs and discounts. Efforts: December's Autumn Statement gave small business owners a £2.5bn tax break on business rates, which came into effect yesterday, to stop empty shops blighting high streets . It has led to extraordinary situations in which a retailer in Rochdale has a higher ‘per square metre’ charge than Harrods, London’s exclusive department store. Mr Cherry said: ‘Lots of our members are saying this is a fundamental issue. It is affecting far too many businesses. 'It is a tax paid before you even open the gates or the door. It is a tax which is not fit for purpose in the 21st-century.’ Ken Clarke claimed Mr Cameron is wrong to say his hands are tied by Brussels to make policy changes . In December’s Autumn Statement, small business owners were yesterday given a £2.5billion tax break on business rates in a desperate bid to stop empty shops blighting ailing high-streets. Changes include a discount of up to £1,000 a year for small retail businesses on their business rate bills as well as capping the increase in April at two per cent. Small business rate relief, which was due to end in the spring, was also extended for a further 12 months until April 2015, benefitting a total of 540,000 small firms. It is not clear how business rates could be reformed, or when any changes will come into effect, but it is unlikely before the next general election. Mr Cameron made his pledge as Ken Clarke yesterday put himself even further at odds with his more Eurosceptic colleagues by saying it is ‘mythology’ the UK is powerless to oppose Brussels regulations. The Cabinet minister said it was not true that ‘heroic British ministers’ are resisting a slew of EU directives that tie up business in red tape. He said: ‘It’s very hard to find an EU regulation of significance which has been forced on an unwilling British minister who voted against it.’ Mr Clarke added that such an idea ‘had always been a myth.’ Mr Clarke’s comments contradict those of his leader David Cameron last week, when he accused Europe of ‘burdensome, unjustified and premature regulatory burdens.’ A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said ‘a longer term review of business rates administration will consider the system’s transparency, efficiency and responsiveness.’","Prime Minister vows to find long-term reform for hated charging system .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Jon Stewart has continued his public skewering of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives following the government shutdown. After a lengthy attack on Monday about the decision to avoid passing the budget due to the Republican hatred for the Affordable Care Act, he had a different target during his first show since the shutdown went into effect. During his Tuesday show, Stewart lambasted Republican talking heads who he believed were belittling Americans who will be affected by the suspension of certain government programs. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making his point clear: Jon Stewart, who is well-known for his liberal leanings, has been extremely critical of the Republicans since the beginning of the shutdown . In a Fox News clip, a Republican talking head was seen telling Sean Hannity that Democrats were acting as if the shutdown was the beginning of the apocalypse. 'If you believe the Democrats, it's time to go out and buy the potted meat and Tang and get in your survival bunker,' the conservative guest said during the Fox clip. 'F*** you because first of all, democrats aren't the ones with survival bunkers- that's you guys,' Stewart said, as seen in the clip available on Gawker. 'And second, I know that for you potted meat and Tang is shorthand for sh** you wouldn't possibly consider eating unless there was a catastrophe but for the people actuall affected by the government shutdown, it's the sh** they eat that they can no longer afford.' Pointed: He used a clip of a Republican commentator on Sean Hannity's Fox News show as an example of the belittling attitude that Republicans have for the Americans who have lost assistance during the shutdown . The program in question is the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) supplemental nutrition program for low-income citizens. 'It's like taking candy from a baby, except instead of candy, it's food,' Stewart said. The comedian-turned-political satirist made his feelings about the logjam abundantly clear on Monday night when his show aired just an hour before the shutdown went into effect. While a number of news anchors likened the back-and-forth of the bills between the Senate and the House as a stalemate, as opposed to the one-sided conflict that Stewart sees. 'I'm all for a pox on both their houses when appropriate but this is not a game of chicken! This is when someone is driving to work and there's a car coming directly at them in their lane. That's not a game of chicken, that's an a****** causing a head-on collision,' he said. Political posturing: Stewart said that Republicans were only making themselves look worse by discrediting President Obama's talks with the Iranian President . 'Did you see the Giants game on . Sunday? Okay: they lost 31 to 7. And you know what the Giants didn’t say . after that game? 'If you don’t give us 25 more points by midnight on . Monday, we are gonna shut down the NFL!' 'Wouldn't . it be nice if the United States Congress aspired to the maturity and . problem solving capacity of football players- this is utter insanity . He also critiqued the Republican talking point that many of the party's leaders have been touting, saying that President Obama is to blame for the shutdown because he did not spend enough time with congressional leaders talking over possible compromises. Instead, they raised his landmark discussion with the President of Iran as a offensive tactic, one which Stewart said only made Republicans look worse. 'You’re not helping yourself. If it turns out that President Barack Obama can make a deal with the most intransigent, hardline, unreasonable, totalitarian mullahs in the world, but not with Republicans, maybe he’s not the problem,' he said.","Comedian took aim at a clip where a conservative commentator said that Democrats were making the shutdown seem like the apocalypse .

"By . Becky Barrow . An independent Scotland could be an economic disaster, triggering financial instability and significant spending cuts, Vince Cable warned yesterday. In a stark assessment, the Lib Dem Business Secretary suggested Scots would have to pay VAT on food and face higher stamp prices, while they would also be hit by currency chaos and isolation from Europe. And he predicted Royal Bank of Scotland, which has been based north of the border since 1727, would move to London. Way out? Royal Bank of Scotland could be force to abandon its Edinburgh HQ to move to London in the event of independence, Vince Cable claimed . It . is just the latest high-level intervention amid growing fears of the . impact of a ‘yes’ vote in the referendum on Scottish independence on . September 18. Bob Dudley, . chief executive of BP, this week became the first business leader to say . Britain is better off in its current form, saying: ‘My personal view is . Great Britain is great and it ought to stay together.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable also raised doubts about Scotland joining the EU, and warned it could mean VAT being added to food and children's clothes . And last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that Scotland could never be fully independent if it keeps the pound. During . an hour-long grilling by MPs on the Business Select Committee, Mr Cable . revealed his concerns about the consequences of an independent Scotland . on the everyday lives of Scots and the day-to-running of local . businesses, suggesting: . On . RBS’s likelihood of staying in Scotland, he said: ‘If you were managing . RBS, you could almost certainly want to be in a domicile where your . bank is protected against the risk of collapse. ‘I . think they already have a substantial amount of their management in . London. I would have thought that inevitably they would become a London . bank.’ He also raised his . doubts about the ‘depleting resources’ from the North Sea oil reserves, . and the impact that this would have on Scotland’s finances. There are fears billions of pounds in trade between Scotland's financial services sector and the rest of the UK will be threatened by independence . Mr Cable said: ‘It is very difficult to see how this couldn’t avoid quite severe cuts in public spending.’ He . also drew attention to the ‘very high level of worry about what an . independent Scotland would look like’ among Scottish business leaders. After the hearing, a spokesman for Scotland’s Finance Secretary John Swinney dismissed Mr Cable’s comments as ‘ridiculous’. He . said: ‘The pound is as much Scotland’s as it is the rest of the UK’s, . and the fiscal commission working group, with experts including two . Nobel laureates, have concluded that it’s in the interests of both . Scotland and the UK to continue to retain sterling in a formal monetary . union.’ The Chancellor George Osborne has already cast doubt on whether a currency sharing arrangement would be possible. Last . night, an RBS spokesman said it is ‘monitoring the independence debate’ and said it remains ‘politically completely neutral’.","Warns it will be hard to join the EU and food could be hit by VAT .

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . Maxine Kumin, a prolific New England poet and U.S. poet laureate who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her work 'Up Country,' has died. She was 88. The Bennett Funeral Home in Concord says Kumin, who wrote more than three dozen books of poetry, fiction, non-fiction and children's literature, died Thursday at her home in Warner after a year of failing health. Kumin was an advocate for women writers, human and political justice and animal rights. Her final work, 'And Short the Season,' is scheduled to be released later this year. Pulitzer-prize winning poet Maxine Kumin died at 88 on Thursday at her farm in Warner, NH . Born in Philadelphia, she graduated from Radcliffe College and lived for a while in Newton, Mass. Kumin's family said her work was marked by a love and deep observation of nature and an unwavering commitment to the craft of writing. Kumin was a close friend of the famous poet Anne Sexton, reports the Boston Globe. The two of them had taken a writing workshop earlier in their careers and kept a private phone line between their houses. They would call each other when they had lines of poetry to share. Anne Sexton commit suicide in 1974. Kumin 'lived the longest of that generation' said Don Share of poetry magazine. 'In a way, I think the trajectory of her work was saner and healthier. She managed to keep going. And she not only survived, but I think her survival comes from being so tough,' he continued. Kumin even cheated death once in her 70s when she was thrown from a carriage while getting ready for an equestrian contest. The horse swerved to avoid trampling her but the 350 pound carriage broke her neck, 11 ribs, bruised her organs, and punctured a lung. Despite her injuries, Kumin kept on writing through the pain. She wrote a memoir detailing her struggle called, 'Inside the Halo and Beyond.' Her work was often honored and she was given a Ruth Lily Poetry Prize in 1999 from the Poetry Foundation and was given the Harvard Arts Medal in 2005. Kumin was honored to serve as consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. Kumin married engineer Victor Kumin in 1946 and has three children. She raised two daughters named Judith and Jane and also a son Daniel. In addition to her husband and children, Kumin leaves behind two grandchildren.

"By . Becky Barrow . The longest pay squeeze in history could finally be over, with millions of workers expected to receive pay rises which beat inflation this year, experts said yesterday. For the past five years, the average worker’s pay rise has been far below the rate of inflation, an unprecedented squeeze which has left people struggling to cope with soaring household bills. The Office for National Statistics said yesterday inflation dropped to 2 per cent in December – the first time it has been at or below the Government’s target of 2 per cent since November 2009. In a surprise drop, CPI inflation fell to the Bank of England's 2 per cent target in December . Private sector bosses expect to reward their workers with an average pay rise of 2.5 per cent this year. This would represent the first inflation-beating pay rise since the financial crisis began. At present, private sector workers are getting average pay rises of just 1.3 per cent. Andrew Goodwin, a senior economic adviser to the accountants, Ernst & Young’s Item Club, said: ‘It has been a long road, but after a gap of four years we’re finally back at the 2 per cent target.’ Rob Harbron, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: ‘With a more benign inflation outlook ahead, the coming 12 months could see the first return to  sustained increases in real wages since the financial crisis.’ Chris Williamson, chief economist at the consultancy Markit, added: ‘A return to real wages growth is becoming a distinct possibility for 2014.’ The squeeze on families has been long and painful. Yesterday the ONS said the cost of food and soft drinks had grown at a faster rate than inflation for ‘each of the last eight years’. It is a trend which has pushed many families to cut back on the amount of food they buy, or to switch to cheaper supermarkets, such as Aldi and Lidl. Contributions to the change in the 12-month CPI rate for December . There is growing pressure on bosses to reward workers with a proper pay rise, with millions of workers earning less today than they did when the financial crisis began after pay has been adjusted for inflation. Chancellor George Osborne said yesterday: ‘You see in the inflation numbers that the economic plan is working for people. ‘Inflation is at its lowest level for four years. It’s on target and it’s by working through our economic plan that we can deliver for people, deliver the economic security and peace of mind that people want in this country.’ Anne Sharp, chief executive of Acas, the employment relations service, said: ‘While the economy is showing signs of recovery, pay may well loom large on the employment relations agenda in 2014 as workers look to catch up for past pay restraint.’ House prices are nearly 80 per cent higher in London than they are in the rest of the country, according to the ONS. While house prices rose by 5.4 per cent in the UK in the 12 months to November 2013, they rose by only 3.1 per cent if London and the South East is excluded. The ONS said house prices in London had jumped by 11.6 per cent over the last year. The figures make clear how London’s rampant house price inflation affects the figures for the whole of the country.Stephen Smith, director of housing at the insurer, Legal & General, said: ‘It is important to consider the overall picture. ‘While London and the South East have been forging ahead with exponential growth, prices in the rest of the country have risen at a much slower rate.’","CPI inflation rate fell to Bank of England's 2% target rate .

"By . Sam Webb . A survey has revealed that many young people distrust Muslims and feel Britain would be better off if there were less of them in the country. Of the 1,000 young people questioned in a BBC survey, 27 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds said they didn't trust Muslims, while a similar number said Britain would be better off with fewer Muslims. It also emerged that 60 per cent thought the British public had a negative image of Muslims and 44 per cent said Muslims do not have the same values as the rest of the population. A total of 16 per cent said they didn't trust Hindus or Sikhs, 15 per cent said they didn't trust Jewish people, while 13 per cent and 12 per cent said they didn't trust Buddhists and Christians respectively. Worrying: 27 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds said they didn't trust Muslims, while a similar number said Britain would be better off with fewer. Pictured is a Muslim woman wearing a hijab in Trafalgar Square, London . Those surveyed say Islamophobia in Britain is stoked by terror groups abroad (26 per cent), the media (23 per cent) and UK Muslims involved int terrorist atrocities (21 per cent). Just three in 10 think Muslims are taking sufficient measures to combat extremism in their communities. However, overall young people are more likely to agree (48 per cent) than disagree (27 per cent) that Islam is a peaceful religion. Akeela Ahmed, from the Cross-government Working Group on Anti-Muslim Hatred, said young people must mix with Muslims more in order to dispel their prejudices. Combat prejudice: Youngsters must get to know Muslims to overcome their fears, a Government group said . He said: 'These findings indicate that we need to ensure young people are mixing at local levels and that they're working on projects together so that people can get to know Muslims and vice versa.' Fellow group member Professor Matthew Goodwin added: 'Every survey that I have run, and surveys run by my academic colleagues, makes it quite clear that a significant proportion of the British population hold negative views of Islam, and by extension British Muslim communities.' The Government group blames negative media coverage of Muslims for stoking anti-Islam sentiment. The Metropolitan Police released figues in August that suggest there has been a 61 per cent rise in anti-Muslim crime, such as attacks on mosques, in London over the past year. There are also claims the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby in May has fuelled anti-Muslim sentiment. The Muslim Council of Britain called the rise in violence since the 25-year-old's death.'unprecedented' Muslim Anisha Patel was recently attacked by two men who pulled off her daughter's veil. She said: 'The kind of comments, the kind of looks and stares that we're experiencing at this moment in time is very different to what it was before,' she said. 'They've become much more hostile, much more bitter, and much more aggressive in nature. It's actually got to the stage where I'm beginning to feel that I want to stay in my house.' Terror attacks, such as the one in Nairobo Kenya (left), earlier this week, and the brutal murder of Lee Rigby (right), are believed to stoke anti-Islamic sentiment . A 20-year-old woman who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC she fears and dislikes Muslims. 'When you hear about terrorism, more often than not it is Muslims that have carried it out. I just feel they're all out to do that, they're all the same,' she said. Young people are also divided over whether or not immigration is good for Britain overall. Two-fifths say it is a good thing but more than a third disagree.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A suspected drink-driver lost control of his SUV and ploughed into a house, tearing through two bedrooms, a living room and a dining room before ending up in the backyard.

"By . Becky Barrow . For generations of children, they were as strongly associated with school as weekly spelling tests, times tables and freezing cold showers after PE. Now the company which for 140 years has been making the custom woven nametapes diligently sewn by parents into each piece of school uniform, has gone into administration. Cash’s, Coventry’s oldest remaining weaving business, is now desperately seeking a buyer after its product apparently fell out of favour with a new generation of parents. School's out: Cash's, the company which for 140 years has been making the custom woven nametapes diligently sewn by parents into each piece of school uniform, has gone into administration . Since 1870, Cash’s has been made the name tapes, available in several primary colours and several styles of handwriting. But now parents who cannot be bothered to sew nametapes into their children’s school uniform appear to have sounded the death knell for the firm. The woven nametape appears to have been replaced by a waterproof pen which parents use to scribble their child’s name on the label of their uniform - if parents can be bothered even to do that. Fran Daly, who worked at Cash’s in the 1960s and 70s, told the BBC: ‘It was a delightful place to work. Everyone got on really well. ‘It is a shame. It was a wonderful British family company, but I’m not surprised. ‘Cash’s was the best quality but it was a lot of work and expensive so difficult for them to compete with name pens and stickers that can be made much cheaper.’ A Thirties ad for the product: Cash¿s began in 1846 when it was England¿s leading silk ribbon maker, diversifying into woven name tapes in 1870 . Siobhan Freegard, from the parenting website NetMums, said: ‘I think the advent of the waterproof pen which costs about 20p at the checkout of all school uniform shops was the problem. It is like a magic wand.’ The mother-of-three says she feels ‘hugely impressed’ by any child who comes to play with her children if she spots a woven nametape sewn into their uniform. Mrs Freegard said: ‘It is like a sign that says: ‘Perfect Mum.’ Last night, the joint administrator Will Wright, a partner at the accountants KPMG, said: ‘I really hope that this is not the end of the road for the business.’ He is hopeful of finding a buyer for Cash’s, which was still making around 9,000 nametapes last week, he said. Mr Wright said: ‘There is interest out there. We are hopeful.’ The majority of the 58 people employed at the Coventry factory have been made redundant while KPMG desperately searches for a buyer for the business. Cash’s began in 1846 when it was England’s leading silk ribbon manufacturer, diversifying into woven name tapes in 1870. It was set up by two Quaker brokers, John and Joseph Cash, but no member of the family is still involved in the company. In 1964, it was appointed ‘Manufacturers of Woven Name Tapes to Her Majesty the Queen.’","Cash's is desperately seeking a buyer after its product fell out of favour .

Sky Movies: The Sky Movies Pass comes with a 30-day free trial and then costs £8.99 for three months. It is set to rival the likes of the £249 YouView set-top box, Roku and Apple's respective boxes, that cost £49.99 and £99 respectively, and the new Chromecast dongle from Google, priced in the U.S at $35 (£22). Plus, the £9.99 Now TV price includes shipping. The Nox TV box is around the same size as a beer mat - 84mm x 84mm x 24mm - and connects to any TV that has a HDMI port. The box then connects wirelessly to a home Wi-Fi network and turns the TV set into a web-enabled device. Once the Now TV box is connected, users can access the box's interface by changing the output on their TV and navigate through menus and services using a special remote control. On-demand services including BBC iPlayer and Demand 5, the catch-up service from Channel 5, is available free of charge, without a contract.

Chromecast, the new $35 HDMI dongle from Google, was announced earlier this week. The device was being offered with a free three month subscription to Netflix promotion that was offered on a limited basis. Google has since announced that the Netflix promotion has ended and the Chromecast has also sold out. The news follows the announcement of Google's Chromecast earlier this week that works in a similar way to the Now TV box by plugging into a TV's HDMI port and letting users stream content from a tablet, phone or laptop to their TV screen. According to Now TV, over two thirds of Brits have now taken advantage of on-demand services on their main TV sets – whether via Smart TVs or other connected devices. Two in five people stream must-see shows or movies on a weekly basis. Over half the UK (56 per cent) use more traditional internet-connected devices such as tablets, smartphones or laptops to access TV on demand whilst in the home. Figures from Blinkx, the internet media platform, found that 86 per cent people aged 18 to 34 share videos online after watching, and 59 per cent are sharing on a regular basis. Chromecast, pictured, plugs into a TV set's HDMI port and can be used to stream web content from mobiles, tablets and laptops.

Sky's £9.99 Now TV box is competitively . priced against the Roku streaming box, pictured left, which starts at around £50 and the . Apple TV device, right, which sells for around £99 . Recent rumours suggest that Apple is looking at ways to . remove adverts from its upcoming TV set in a bid to boost sales if and . when the device launches later this year. The . company has reportedly spoken with broadcasters about the deal and is . even thought to have offered to compensate them for any revenue they . lose as a result. Other rumours claim the TV set could be controlled using a ring worn on a viewer's finger. Sky's Now TV launched in July 2012. It has helped boost the number of Sky TV customers to 14.8 million with average revenues per user at £577 a year. Sky has also said it is expanding its Sky Go mobile TV service with another 10 channels, is adding 20 new channels to its catch-up TV service, and plans to upgrade its TV boxes to hold more content. Sky said 35 per cent of its customers are now taking TV, broadband and phone services, up from 32 per cent last year. But its churn rate - how many customers are leaving - increased to 10.9 per cent from 9.9 per cent. Its Now TV device will also challenge the £299 YouView box, a joint venture between BT, TalkTalk, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Arqiva which also offers on-demand TV for free. YouView was criticised for its high price compared to other services on the market yet announced in July it gained 400,000 customers in the eight months since its launch and streams 2.2 million video-on-demand views every week. In other TV news, BT yesterday revealed it has already . signed up half a million customers to its sport channels ahead of their . launch - although most of these were existing subscribers.

"By . William Turvill . The United States is said to have told Nato allies that Russia has been testing a new ground-launched cruise missile, despite Moscow being prohibited from carrying out such tests thanks to a 30-year-old treaty. Rose Gottemoeler, the U.S. state . department’s senior arms control official, has reportedly . asked Russian officials about the tests on several occasions since May last year . The department believes the flight tests could have been going on for up to six years. Tension: The United States (president Barack Obama, pictured) has accused Russia (president Vladimir Putin, pictured) of testing a new ground-launched cruise missile, in breach of a treaty signed by the nations in 1987 . The 1987 treaty, signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, was seen as a major factor in bringing an end to the Cold War (stock picture) Russia is said to have responded by saying that the matter has been investigated and the case is now closed. According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama is not yet ready to officially declare the tests. The situation comes at a time when he is pledging to make further cuts in nuclear arms. A state department spokesman told the paper there would be no hesitation to ‘raise treaty compliance concerns with Russia, and this issue is no exception’. Jen Psaki, the State Department spokesman, added: 'There’s an ongoing review process, and we wouldn’t want to speculate or prejudge the outcome.' There have been a number of disputes between Washington and Moscow in recent months, including over Edward Snowden's temporary asylum in Russia . Other officials have reportedly said it is clear the tests were non-compliant with the 1987 treaty. The White House is said to be being pressured into forming a firmer response. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, . then the presidents of the U.S. and Soviet Union, signed a treaty . banning medium-range missiles in 1987. The treaty banning the testing, production and possession of medium-range missiles was regarded as an important milestone in putting the brakes on the U.S. and Russian arms race and was a key contributor in ending the Cold War. Medium range missiles are ground-launched ballistic or cruise missiles that have a flying range of 300-3,400 miles. Intercontinental missiles can fly beyond that range. This situation is the latest in a long line of disputes between the two nations in recent months. Last year, the Washington and Moscow clashed over Edward Snowden’s temporary asylum in Russia and the crisis in Syria. More recently, conflict in Ukraine has caused tensions to rise between the countries.","U.S tells allies Russia may have been flight testing for up to six years .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . An 11-year-old girl found wandering alone and disoriented in China was the victim of horrifying abuse at the hands of her father, it has emerged. The young girl's mouth had been stitched up with fishing cord and her head submerged in boiling water, her skin had been pierced with sewing needles, and she had been hung upside down and beaten, according to reports. The girl, named as Xiao Li, who is now recovering in hospital, has scars all over her body and chunks of hair are missing from her scalded scalp. Torture: Details of the horrific abuse the girl suffered have emerged from Shichang in China . Local news reports in China said the girl was talking to herself and occasionally shouting abuse at passersby when a man approached her on May 8. The man, named as Mr Fu, discovered the girl was missing hair and was covered in scars, a Sky News report said. Villagers told Mr Fu the girl's name was Xiao Li, and that she had suffered abuse at the hands of her father, named only as Yang. Mr Fu contacted police and Yang was arrested. Through a combination of ensuing medical examinations and police interviews with Yang officers have pieced together the nightmare ordeal the 11-year-old girl suffered. Photographs of the little girl, who was made to kneel on a floor covered in shards of broken glass, reveal fresh wounds alongside scars left behind from old injuries. Doctors fear she has been malnourished for much of her life, and suspect her hair will never grow back. Horror: The 11-year-old girl was wandering alone in a town in Guizhou province (pictured) in China . The girl's grandmother has said in an interview that her parents left home to find work shortly after Xiao Li was born. She was looked after by her grandparents for five years before her father returned and the abuse began. The grandmother claimed she was aware of the abuse but powerless to stop it, and said her son Yang abused her as well as her granddaughter. Police in China were made aware of the incident when the little girl's head was plunged into boiling water. Yang is said to have told officers he was trying to rid his daughter of head lice. He was ordered to take his daughter to hospital, but police did not pursue the matter further. The 11-year-old is recovering in hospital in China, where the costs of her medical treatment have been waived. Government officials in the area say they are seeking guardians to take care of Xiao Li as her grandparents are now to old to care for her, the Sky News report said.","Girl found walking in Shichang in China's southwestern Guizhou province .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Sat-navs are great for navigating unfamiliar cities and wildernesses, but it can be difficult for drivers to focus on the road when they are trying to read directions on a sat-nav device at the same time. Now, however, an iPhone app claims to make using a GPS device safer while driving. The program uses a smartphone as a projection device to beam the projections from its app onto a car's windscreen so that drivers no longer have to look down while they drive. Scroll down for video . The Hudway app beams driving directions onto a car's windscreen using just an iPhone. It also shows the next upcoming sharp turn and the car's speed, in a bid to make driving in severe weather conditions and at night, safer, as driver so not have to look down at a sat-nav . The app uses Google Maps for its location information. Once the free app is downloaded, iPhone users can make a route on a map, which the app pre-loads so the map can be used without an internet connection. The iPhone is placed on a car's dashboard and secured . The app beams driving directions, a car's speed and turning alerts onto the car's windscreen, which refelects the driving directions off the glass. This means the driver does not need to look down while he or she is in control of the vehicle. The Russian company said the app is 'a unique application for the . smartphone that allows drivers to focus on the road, keep hands on the . wheel and mind on driving.' The Hudway app adds an augmented reality element to the windscreen without users having to spend a penny, as the app is free and no special glass coverings for the car are needed. To use the app, a user simply needs to place their phone on the dashboard and secure it in some way, enabling the app to beam a visual of the road onto the windscreen along with their speed and distance until the next potentially dangerous turn. The free iPhone app taps into Google Maps to get its location information. It allows users to pre-load routes before they embark on their journey so the Hudway app does not need to be constantly connected to the internet. App users can also save and share their routes . Sharp turns are highlighted in red and road markers are displayed every 50 metres to help drivers measure the distance before the next big turn, which is designed to be particularly useful in severe fog or at night, when visibility can be restricted in dimly lit areas. While images show the app in use in snowy and drizzly conditions, some experts question whether the screen from the iPhone is strong enough to project light onto the windscreen in bright  daytime conditions. Critically, the Russian start-up says that an internet connection is not required for the duration of a car journey as users can set up a route on the app and pre-load a map from Google before they embark on their journey. The Hudway app adds an augmented reality element to the windscreen without users having to spend a penny, as the app is free and no special glass coverings are needed . The company said: 'Current navigation systems are inherently . unsafe. They distract driverâ€™s attention away from the road. Especially . it's not safe in low visibility conditions - rain, fog, heavy snow, . night or just dark.' The firm has developed the app in a bid to reduce accidents as a result of poor weather conditions. According to the World Healthy Organisation, 350 people die every day across the globe as a result of low visibility conditions on the road. The Hudway app also allows users to save routes and share them with friends and an Android version is scheduled for February 2014, Dvice reported.","The app puts augmented reality details on the windscreeen, including driving instructions, speed and distance until sharp turns .

"By . William Turvill . Rodney Brossart has been jailed for six months thanks in part to evidence from a Predator drone . A U.S. citizen has been jailed thanks to evidence from a Predator drone for the first time. Police deployed the drone, ordinarily used to track down and assassinate terrorists and militants in countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan, following a stand-off between officers and farmer Rodney Brossart, who has now been jailed for six months. Brossart was initially accused - and subsequently cleared - of stealing six cows worth $6,000 (£3,625) from a neighbour. But the drone was used when he refused to allow officers on to his 3,600-acre farm in Lakota, North Dakota - despite them having a warrant. When police went to collect the lost cattle in the summer of 2011, three of Brossart's sons - Alex, Jacob and Thomas - allegedly confronted Nelson County Sheriff Kelly Janke with rifles and shotguns. That's when the sheriff summoned a $154 million MQ-9 Predator B drone from nearby Grand Forks Air Force Base, where it was patrolling the US-Canada border for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Using a handheld device that picked up the video camera footage from the spy plane, Sheriff Janke was able to watch the movements of everyone on the farm. During a 16-hour standoff, the sheriff and his deputies waited until they could see the remaining Brossarts put down their weapons. Brossart got a three-year sentence – all but six months of it suspended – for refusing to allow officers on to his land to investigate the cattle theft complaint, according to Fox News. Meanwhile, charges were dropped against Brossart’s wife and daughter for their alleged involvement. Charges against his three sons are still pending. The drones, armed with Hellfire missiles, are ordinarily used to track down terrorists and militants . Sons (Thomas and Jacob pictured) allegedly confronted officers with guns when they came to the farm in 2011 . Then, dressed in SWAT gear, they stormed the compound and arrested the three Brossart sons. No shots were fired. It is not known how long it was deployed for or whether it got evidence of the alleged cattle crime. But the exercise did obtain enough evidence for Brossart and four family members to be arrested ion terrorising charges in November 2011. Brossart was found not guilty of stealing the cows, but was jailed for six months because of the armed stand-off with police. Charges were dropped against Brossart’s wife and daughter, Abby, (pictured) for their alleged involvement. Charges against his three sons (Alex pictured) are still pending .","Police deployed the drone following a stand-off between officers and farmer Rodney Brossart and his family .

"By . Andrew  Malone . With the door to the steam room shut at his Ascot home, Boris Berezovsky liked to retreat from the stresses of being a sworn enemy of Vladimir Putin, the former KGB man he bankrolled to become Russia’s president. But it was in this sanctuary that his body was found on Saturday, a discovery that has started a firestorm of suspicion about the manner of his death. Once such good friends that Berezovsky spent millions creating a political party for Putin, the pair fell out spectacularly in 2000, prompting the Russian leader’s supposed ‘godfather’ to flee to Britain. Unanswered questions: Boris Berezovsky's body was found at his estate in Ascot on Saturday, a discovery that has started a firestorm of suspicion about the manner of his death . Suggestions that Berezovsky, pictured with his former girlfriend Elena Gorbunova and their dog, Sim, had committed suicide were being treated with scepticism by the billionaire's friends and business associates . Yet even after escaping Moscow and moving into the former home of TV star Chris Evans, replete with hi-tech security systems as well as underground car parking, sauna and swimming pool, Berezovsky did not feel safe. Surrounded by teams of Russian security men, and with a personal bodyguard alongside him 24 hours a day, he was convinced his Kremlin enemies would track him down and kill him, even after he moved two years ago to a new property in Berkshire. Yesterday, suggestions that Berezovsky had committed suicide – as reported widely by the Russian media – were being treated with scepticism by the billionaire’s friends and business associates. ‘Boris was a fighter, and suicide was just not in his DNA,’ said Dr Yuri Felshtinsky, a close friend. 'Boris was looking to the future and did not seem to be suicidal. We spoke about his daughter. ‘Boris feared for his safety, and understood that the Kremlin aimed to destroy him as an example for anyone else who opposed them. He understood the Kremlin mindset better than anyone.’ Andrei Sidelnikov, a Berezovsky supporter given political asylum by Britain for his opposition to Putin, was emphatic. ‘Such a person could never commit suicide,’ he said. ‘He was an exceptionally lively person and, despite his various setbacks in life, always remained so.’ The discovery of Berezovsky's body comes five years after the unexplained death of another billionaire, Badri Patarkatsishvili (pictured), who he joined forces with to put Putin into power . Demyan Kudryavtsev, another Russian emigre and friend of the dead billionaire, also dismissed speculation that Berezovsky had killed himself: ‘No, it’s wrong. There are no exterior signs of suicide, no traces of a syringe, no signs that he could have taken some pills.’ Even more disturbing, the discovery of Berezovsky’s body comes five years after the unexplained death of another billionaire he joined forces with to put Putin into power – and who also later fell out spectacularly with the Russian leader. Badri Patarkatsishvili, a businessman and politician, was found dead at the Surrey mansion he owned, not far from Berezovsky’s former home, in 2008. Police, who initially described the death as ‘suspicious’, tested for radiation poisoning, but no traces were found. Along with Berezovsky, the dead man had helped bankroll Putin’s rise to the Kremlin, but had later clashed with associates of the country’s president as rival sides battled for control of Russia’s assets. No doubt: Berezovsky was hated in the Kremlin . Shortly before his death, the 52-year-old had spoken of an assassination plot, claiming that a hit squad of four Georgians had been sent by the Kremlin to London ‘to do something against me’, while secret tapes of a conversation between a Russian official and a Chechen hitman emerged in which they discussed how to make him ‘disappear completely’. Experts say that, as well as deadly substances such as ricin and polonium, a favoured method for despatching enemies of Russia is poisoning with sodium fluoroacetate, a chemical used in pesticides that causes heart failure when ingested in tiny amounts, with the cause of death notoriously difficult to establish. If Patarkatsishvili was assassinated, could the long arm of the Russian leadership have reached out to an enemy in the Home Counties again? There is no doubt Berezovsky was hated in the Kremlin. Yet it would be a grim end indeed for a man who was once a model Soviet citizen. Born in Moscow in 1946 to a Jewish civil engineer father and housewife mother, he was studious at school and sufficiently gifted at mathematics to join the Soviet Union’s Academy of Sciences. But the collapse of communism helped propel him from academia to the pinnacle of one of the most ruthless and violent business environments on Earth: post-Soviet Russia. As the Soviet empire crumbled and gang wars erupted, Berezovsky decided to go into business and forged a relationship with AvtoVAZ, producer of the Lada car. To protect his fortune, Berezovsky forged ties with Chechen gangsters – some of the most feared people in Russia. The graveyards of Russia are full of dead businessmen from the 1990s, and Berezovsky almost joined them: he faced a gun battle in central Moscow in 1994, and a year later the Mercedes he was in was blown up, decapitating his driver. But with nerves of steel, Berezovsky went for broke: he paid for the publication of President Boris Yeltsin’s memoirs, securing him the goodwill of Russia’s then leader. The political clout this gave him offered access to the national airline Aeroflot, and then to Russia’s massive oil reserves. Rewarded with a seat on Yeltsin’s national Security Council, he helped implement the peace deal that ended Russia’s first war with rebels in the Chechnya region, and was seen as a figure of almost Rasputin-like influence. To protect his fortune, Berezovsky forged ties with Chechen gangsters - some of the most feared people in Russia (police pictured at a road block near to where it is believed Boris Berezovsky died in Ascot) As Yeltsin’s health deteriorated in 1999 and his popularity plummeted, Berezovsky and others began to look for a protege who could rule Russia for its second post-Soviet decade. The obscure former KGB spy they found was Putin, who was officially approved by the powerbrokers of Russia during talks at their dachas around Moscow. ‘He presented [Putin] to the Russian establishment of that time, brought him into Boris Yeltsin’s close circle, and he was the first to believe that out of this indistinct bureaucrat, a successor could be made,’ said commentator Sergei Parkhomenko. ‘He was certainly the political father of Vladimir Putin.’ Yet, after he came to power backed by Berezovsky’s cash, Putin became irritated with the demands of his sponsor, who once said: ‘Everything can be bought and everything on Earth has a price. Politicians are the hired help of entrepreneurs.’ Last year Berezovsky suffered a devastating financial setback when he lost a legal battle with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich (pictured) This was an affront to Putin, a proud, self-proclaimed strongman who did not like anyone having power over him. His response was characteristically uncompromising, and after a series of death threats Berezovsky fled. Since Britain rebuffed Putin’s calls for Berezovsky to be extradited, the Kremlin has been busy preparing case after case against him in absentia – with ‘crimes’ allegedly ranging from massive fraud to murder. Undeterred, Berezovsky used his British base to vow to overthrow Putin. He joined forces with other exiles to implicate the Russian state in killings. But last year he suffered a devastating financial setback when he lost a legal battle with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Berezovsky wanted £4billion from Abramovich, whom he accused of using the threat of Kremlin retribution to intimidate him into selling shares at a knockdown price. Some say Berezovsky had struggled to come to come to terms with losing the case, in which legal costs hit £100million. Clearly shaken by the verdict in August, Berezovsky said it appeared to have been written by Putin himself. ‘Life is life,’ he sighed, before being driven off in a black Mercedes with tinted windows. Those who believe he died either of natural causes or at his own hand point to his dramatic loss of capital in recent times. His fortune, once estimated at £2billion, was running out, partly because he had spent years fighting a losing battle against Kremlin attempts to seize his assets. He was forced to sell his £200million yacht, and closed his political foundation, which had waged a public relations war against Putin, highlighting corruption and political killings linked to the KGB. He was also reeling from one of Britain’s biggest-ever divorce settlements, to his former wife Galina in 2011, to whom he paid more than £60million. Known for his love of cognac and beautiful women, Berezovsky was married three times and was a notorious womaniser. But lately one friend claimed he had been depressed by the loss of his wealth and was not himself. ‘We will learn later what exactly happened, but in recent months Boris was depressed,’ said Alex Goldfarb. ‘There was no secret about that. The court case was a massive blow. He was depressed. We were concerned about him.’ That concern was not shared by his enemies in the Kremlin. While an official spokesman claimed yesterday that Berezovsky had written to Putin this year to apologise, and begged to come home, his friends said this was merely Soviet-style propaganda. Indeed, he would have faced years in prison had he returned. Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: Boris Berezovsky will never criticise the Kremlin again, and that is just the way Vladimir Putin will like it.","Surrounded himself with bodyguards at former home of TV star Chris Evans .

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . Psychedelic drugs could help to keep ex-offenders out of prison, new research suggests. U.S. scientists have found that drugs such as LSD and magic mushrooms could be used to help reform criminals under community correction supervision. It has previously been thought that LSD could be used to treat alcohol addiction, but the new research is the first in 40 years to suggest it could be used to stop criminals from re-offending. Scientists found that criminals diagnosed with a hallucinogen use disorder were less likely to appear in court and be imprisoned, than compared to those who did not have a history of taking drugs such as LSD (molecule is pictured) Research into psychedelic drugs began in 1897 when a German chemist managed to isolate the primary psychoactive compound in a cactus. In 1943 Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann uncovered the hallucinogenic effects of LSD. Research into psychedelic drugs was particularly popular in the 1950s and before 1972 some 700 studies had been carried out. Scientists found the drugs could help treat alcoholics wishing to become teetotal, ease anxiety and reduce the symptoms of OCD, RealitySandwich reported. Combined with psychotherapy, the drug was found to reduce symptoms of depression, tension and sleep disturbances in cancer patients. Other scientists claimed LSD had the potential to facilitate creative problem solving. However, research on human subjects stopped between 1972 and 1990. Researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, collected data about 25,622 people under community supervision between 2002 and 2007. All study participants were in the Treatment Accountability for Safer Communities (TASC) programme, for people with a history of drug abuse, including alcohol addiction, The Raw Story reported. The researchers found that criminals diagnosed with a hallucinogen use disorder were less likely to fail the TASC programme, appear in court and be arrested and imprisoned, compared to those who did not have a history of taking the drugs. Just one per cent of people on the programme were diagnosed with a hallucinogen disorder, while heavy users of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol were the most common. ‘Our results provide a notable exception to the robust positive link between substance use and criminal behaviour,' the researchers wrote in their study, which was published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. ‘They add to both the older and emerging body of data indicating beneficial effects of hallucinogen interventions and run counter to the legal classification as well as popular perception of hallucinogens as categorically harmful substances with no therapeutic potential,’ they added. Researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, collected data about 25,622 people under community supervision between 2002 and 2007 to find that people who used hallucinogenic drugs were less likely to be arrested again . The scientists believe that offenders may be especially likely to benefit from LSD treatment as many people become criminals as a result of drug-seeking behaviour and impulsive conduct, often caused by compulsive drug use. The study took factors such as race, employment, age, history of drug abuse and crimes, as well as gender and education into account. However, the researchers warned that the findings of the study should not be seen to advocate recreational use of psychedelic drugs. ‘Nevertheless, they demonstrate that, in a real-world, substance-related intervention setting, hallucinogen use is associated with a lower probability of poor outcome,’ they wrote. They believe the research should be the start of a continued investigation into the use of psychedelic drugs to treat criminals.","LSD could help reform criminals under community correction supervision .

"By . Reuters . An investigation into the northern California crash between a FedEx truck and bus that killed 10 people last week has turned up 'no evidence' of a pre-collision fire, contrary to a witness report. Authorities said on Sunday they were, however, looking into driver fatigue as a possible cause of the collision. A witness in a car the truck clipped before crashing into the bus reported flames shooting from underneath the truck's cab before the fatal collision. Further investigation found no evidence of that, said Mark Rosekind, a National Transportation Safety Board member. Authorities said Saturday that they had found no evidence of a pre-impact fire at the site of a northern California bus crash . A National Transportation Safety Board investigative team views remaining wreckage of a FedEx truck that collided last week with a school bus, killing 10 people . 'There is no evidence of pre-impact fire . located at the accident scene, on the median or on the highway,' Rosekind told a news conference. ""This is all preliminary, factual . information. Nothing is ruled out yet.' Among the dead were the drivers of the truck and the bus, and five teenage students and a college recruiter going to an event at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, as part of a program to help disadvantaged college hopefuls. More than 30 others were injured in the crash Thursday evening on Interstate 5 about 90 miles north of Sacramento. The students were from the Los Angeles area. At least one of the injured, a female patient, was listed in critical condition Sunday at the UC Davis Medial Center where another patient had died earlier, a hospital spokeswoman said. A National Transportation Safety Board member examines a Nissan Altima that was also struck by the bus . Rosekind said the truck left a southbound lane, crossed a 58-foot (18-meter) median into a northbound lane, hit a Nissan Altima and then struck the bus which was behind the car. There were no barriers in the median, he said. Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones had said previously that a powerful explosion unleashed by the impact was so loud it was heard throughout the nearby community of Orland. The fire consumed the truck and the bus and was so intense that it could be days or weeks before some of the bodies can be identified, and investigators will have to rely on dental records or in some cases DNA testing, the NTSB has said. Rosekind said the NTSB planned to release a preliminary report on the crash in 30 days. A fireball engulfs a truck and a bus carrying high school students following a head-on collision in California. Witnesses to the crash are saying the FedEx truck was already on fire when it crossed over the median strip and collided with the coach .","A FedEx truck collided with a school bus last weekend killing 10 people .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A self-described pastor has been arrested and charged with child rape after his former step daughter came forward with information about prior assaults. Randy Giulliani has been charged with aggravated sexual battery and the rape of a child after his former step daughter accused him of performing sexual acts on her eight to ten years ago. The victim has not been identified due to the nature of the crimes and she is now 14-years-old. She said that the alleged assaults took place when she was five and six years old. Charged: Randy Giulliani, 54, was arrested on charges of raping a child under the age of 13 and aggravated sexual assault . 'The suspect was interviewed several . times during the investigation and sufficient information was learned to . make the arrest on Friday,' the Gallatin police department press . release states. Giulliani, whose current wife is not the mother of the alleged victim, was arrested on Friday in Sumner County, Tennessee. In Tennessee, the legal definition of child rape mandates that the victim is between the age of 3- and 13-years-old. It is considered a Class A felony and must include sexual penetration of the victim. According to WKRN-TV, the 54-year-old told the officers from the Gallatin Police Department that he was a worship leader at an unidentified church in Rutherford County. Giulliani said that the had been a pastor for many years but has not been associated with the church for the past two years. Holding: Giulliani was arrested on Friday and remains in police custody in Gallatin, Tennessee (pictured) 'He calls himself a worship leader. I don't know if hes a pastor or preacher or if he just leads people in song or anything like that,' a Gallatin Police Department spokesman told MailOnline.

Police said they were treating the death as a tragic accident after preliminary investigations did not point to foul play. Officials have not revealed whose gun was used in the shooting. McDuffie told the Observer that he owns a concealed weapon permit but he keeps his gun hidden. He did not reveal where. The grandfather said other family members were in the one-story brick house at the time of the incident, including one of his sons and another grandchild. He told the newspaper his wife was at work.

"By . James  Nye . Prostitutes have begun using the troubled apartment-sharing website, Airbnb to convert luxury Manhattan homes into temporary brothels. The nefarious scheme allows escort agencies to use the much cheaper apartments instead of hotels for clients to meet with their girls. One working girl, who charges up to $500 an hour has claimed that apartments can cost as little as $200 a day - and are usually rented through the internet service in the Financial District or Midtown. Switch: This is the building in Manhattan that was turned into a brothel in late March by an escort agency . 'Itâ€™s more discreet and much cheaper than The Waldorf,' said the sex worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity to the New York Post. 'Hotels have doormen and cameras. They ask questions. Apartments are usually buzz-in.' The 21-year-old woman said that the scam is being operated by agencies - who have their girls rent the apartments through their own personal Airbnb profiles. The apartments are paid for using debit cards and it is estimated that the agencies are saving anywhere up to $400 a day by not using hotels. Shock: Jessica Penzari, 29, who rented out her apartment through Airbnb, March 21 through 23 was stunned to find that it had been turned into a brothel . Indeed, one apartment that was turned into a brothel belongs to Manhattan publicist Jessica Penzari, 20 - who rented hers out through Airbnb from March 21 to March 23. 'She told me that she was in the Army and needed a place to hang out before she got shipped out,' said Penzari of her Airbnb 'guest.' 'She said she was being deployed that week. She was asking for places to go out with her friends.' However, a violent altercation between the girl who rented and a man who had paid for a massage led to the police arriving at Penzari's apartment. When she returned, she found baby wipes and 'at least 10 condoms'. Horrified and sickened, Penzari got Airbnb to put her up in the  InterContinental hotel in Times Square for two nights â€” with room-service meals, while they changed her locks. They also cleaned her apartment and replaced bedsheets, comforters and pillows. Airbnb has been hit by a swath of bad publicity recently. Last month it was revealed that another Manhattan resident had unwittingly rented out his Chelsea apartment last month for a plus-weight orgy called XXX Freak Fest. And in Washington DC last year, a woman reported she had rented out her apartment through Airbnb to a man who used it for male-on-male nude massage.","A number of working girls have admitted the scheme to cut costs with their Manhattan clients .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Some enterprising vagrants are turning New York's Manhattan Bridge into a rent-free residence using only plywood and ingenuity. As rents rise in Brooklyn and working professionals fork out a fortune to live in Manhattan shoeboxes, homeless New Yorkers are living the city life gratis. According to real estate appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate, the median monthly rent in the previously affordable borough of Brooklyn is $2,900, a record high and only marginally cheaper than Manhattan. Prime real estate: The dwellings are built into the upper deck of the bridge, below car traffic but above the subway . Admittedly the dwellings, narrow spaces just big enough for one person to lie down, are cramped, but they provide shelter for people who otherwise have to brave the elements. The New York Post reports that one bridge-dweller, a middle-aged Chinese man, locks his plywood 'door' with a bicycle lock each morning and returns for the evening to sleep. To reach the dwelling, which is built into the bridge frame on the Manhattan side of the bridge, he climbs a chain-link fence. Last Sunday a cyclst saw the man climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him for a jumper, calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending suicide. He was yanked off the fence by police and questioned, finally managing to convey in his limited English that he wasn't trying to jump, but was merely returning home. Prime location: The Manhattan bridge links the city with Brooklyn's DUMBO neighborhood . 'People are really desperate for places to stay. I say, if he’s not bothering anybody, he’s not bothering me. Leave him alone,' Marcha Johnson, a passerby riding her bike near the shantytown told the Post. The pods are built into the underside of the upper deck of the bridge, below car traffic and above the subway. Each 10.5-foot-long space is big enough for a sleeping mat and some personal items. There's no bathroom or kitchen, but it's a place to call home. And for some down-on-their-luck New Yorkers, that's priceless.","Homeless people are constructing dwellings in the Manhattan Bridge .

"By . Associated Press . Joseph Romano, pictured in 2012, claimed Monday the FBI framed him in a plot to kill a judge and prosecutor . A conman already imprisoned in a collectible coin scam was sentenced to a life term on Monday for a bizarre, behind-bars plot to decapitate a judge and a prosecutor. Joseph Romano, of Levittown, New York, was convicted in January on charges he gave orders to have the prosecutor's breasts cut off as well, and that body parts should be preserved in formaldehyde as proof both people were dead. He claimed on Monday that he was framed by federal agents who fabricated the scheme as part of an undercover sting operation. 'I don't care what sentence you give me as long as I know one thing: I'm innocent,' a defiant Joseph Romano told the judge in a rambling statement in federal court in Brooklyn. Romano, 51, went on for more than hour, referencing Charles Manson, literary classics such as Moby Dick and A Christmas Carol and his own weight - 300 pounds. He insisted that the FBI targeted him to silence him. 'They want to bury me,' he said, pointing at grim-faced FBI agents sitting in the audience. 'They want to shut me up... I've never hurt anybody.' U.S. District Judge John Keenan told Romano that he deserved life behind bars because trying to orchestrate a pair of contract killings 'cannot be tolerated in a civilized society' Romano listened quietly, then gathered up a stack of documents and thanked the judge as he was led out of the courtroom. The plot unfolded in 2012 after Romano was sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $7 million in the coin scheme, which victimized elderly investors. His business partner, Dejvid Mirkovic, was sentenced to 24 years in prison for the same scheme. Six months into Romano's sentence, another inmate reported through his lawyer that he had overheard Romano talk about seeking revenge. Joseph Romano, left, was sentenced to life behind bars on Monday for putting a hit on the federal judge and prosecutor who put him and his business partner, Dejvid Mirkovic, right, away for a collectable coin scheme . The inmate agreed to wear a wire and introduce Romano to an undercover federal agent pretending to be a hit man named Bobby Russo. Over the course of several recorded conversations, Romano arranged through a former business partner to pay the undercover agent $40,000 to carry out the killings, referred to in code as 'Dodge trucks.' Jurors heard one recording where Romano gave instructions to shoot the judge, saying, 'Find out where (the judge) is, go there and - boom - right in' the head. Prosecutors alleged that he wanted the prosecutor's body stuffed in a steel drum and dumped in a place where it could never be found. Romano also was accused of trying to arrange an assault a Long Island mechanic for repossessing one of his vintage muscle cars. Undercover investigators staged a photo to make it look as though the mechanic had been knocked out in a beat-down.","Joseph Romano was convicted on Monday of attempting to have the breasts cut off of the prosecutor who put him behind bars .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Phil Casey . Bubba Watson has celebrated his second Masters win in two years with a trip to Waffle House. The down-to-earth golfer, who graciously claimed his win was down to 'luck', uploaded a photo to Twitter showing him and his wife at the restaurant, writing: 'Champ dinner @WaffleHouse! #hashbrowns #covered.' It came just hours after the 35-year-old overtook 20-year-old Jordan Spieth to claim the green jacket. After his spectacular win, Watson celebrated on the green with kisses from his wife Angie and their two-year-old son Caleb. 'Champ dinner': Bubba Watson tweeted this image showing him and his wife Angie, right, at Waffle House with friends following his second Masters win on Sunday . Winner: Friend Judah Smith shared this image of Watson and his celebration party on Sunday . It seems that Caleb is somewhat of a good luck charm for the Florida-born golfer; he won his first Masters title in 2012, just weeks after the couple adopted the baby boy. And after that win, the self-proclaimed 'small town guy' had a familiar subject on his mind: Waffle House. The Golf Channel asked what the Champions Dinner would be at Augusta National the following year. 'I love Waffle House - a grilled cheese from Waffle House and hash browns,' he said. In this year's competition, Watson had trailed Spieth by two shots after seven holes of the final round, but birdied the eighth and ninth as Spieth bogeyed both. At the double: Bubba Watson is pictured just moments after taking his second Masters title in 3 years . Pride: He was met on the green by his proud wife Angie and their two-year-old son Caleb . Support: Watson and his wife share a kiss after he took the Masters title with eight under par . His lead was cut to a shot by a bogey on . the 10th, but a massive drive on the par-five 13th set up a birdie that . gave the left-hander a three-shot cushion over the closing stretch. Only . a handful of players have won more than one Masters title, including . the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, . but Watson was not about to accept the label of an elite player. 'No, . no,' Watson said. 'Again, I just got lucky enough to have two green . jackets. I'm just trying to keep my tour card every year and if people . say that I'm a good player, that's great. 'I'm . trying to play golf for a living. I'm not trying to play golf for . everybody to tell me how great I am or I'm one of the greats of the . game. I play golf because I love it, I love the game, I want to grow the . game. The game has brought me everything that I've ever owned in my . life.' Watson crucially . matched Spieth's birdies on the fourth and sixth - the former after . Spieth had holed out from a greenside bunker, but felt his birdies on . the eighth and ninth were vital. Emotional: Tears roll down Watson's cheeks as he holds Caleb following his spectacular win Sunday . Good luck charm: The couple adopted Caleb, now 2, just weeks before Watson won the Masters in 2012 . By Daddy's side: Caleb held on tightly to his champion dad as Watson thanked fans after the game . 'Eight and nine were really the . turning point where momentum kind of went my way,' he added. 'Then the . group in front of us and other groups, you could just tell, just nobody . really caught fire. There wasn't too many birdies after number 10 I . don't think. 'I don't . remember the last few holes, I just remember hanging on, making pars. Somehow I did and walking up 18 was a little easier this time.' Watson, . who beat Louis Oosthuizen in a play-off two years ago, added: 'This one . is a lot different. The first one is almost like I lucked into it, this . was a lot of hard work and dedication and I got back the green jacket . after giving it away last year.' As defending champion last year, Watson presented the green jacket to then-winner Adam Scott. On Sunday the roles were reversed. Green giant: Bubba Watson is presented with his green jacket by 2013 winner Adam Scott . Hugging it out: Watson embraces caddie Ted Scott after clinching victory . 'I told Adam we should just keep switching it back and forth,' Watson joked. As well as sharing his Waffle House selfie on Twitter, Watson took a moment to thank his fans online after his win. 'Wow. I can't believe I have another @The_Masters green jacket!' he wrote on Twitter. 'Such an honor. #Rejoicing. 'I . want to thank everyone for the support, encouraging words & . congrats that have poured in this week! I feel incredibly blessed # . awesomefans.' Spieth, . who was looking to become the youngest ever Masters champion, carded a . closing 72 to share second place with Sweden's Jonas Blixt. Strong contender: Jordan Spieth, 20, was set to be the youngest Masters winner until Watson pushed ahead . Disappointment: But Spieth, from Dallas, Texas, struggled on the back nine and missed out on the jacket . 'It was so much fun, even if I did not show it on the back nine,' he said. 'Although it stings right now I will be back and I can't wait to be back. That's what's on my mind because it's tough being in this position. 'I've worked my whole life to lead in the Masters on Sunday, I had it in my hands and could have gone forward with it and didn't quite make the putts and that's what it came down to. 'I wanted to get into contention and that's what happened but I can take a lot of positives away. My game held up and I feel like am ready to win a major. It's just a matter of time and maybe a little bit of course knowledge. 'Ultimately hats off to him. He's a . deserving Masters champion this year. He played some incredible golf to . make his pars down the stretch.'","Bubba Watson, 35, overtook Jordan Spieth, 20, to win the Masters on Sunday - two years after his 2012 win .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . Detroit is planning a new push to auction city-owned homes online as part of an effort to fight blight. Mayor Mike Duggan and the Detroit Land Bank Authority on Monday afternoon announced a new auction website that's designed to get homes into the hands of people who will quickly fix them. The site has launched with 15 homes up for auction at Building Detroit. A community meeting about the effort will be held Monday night. Online auction: eBay has a selection of Detroit homes for sale for as little as $86 . Big plans: Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan is carrying out an initiative to revitalize neighborhoods of the struggling city . Duggan said that the city will post legal notices on empty houses and take court action if needed against owners of blighted properties in one northwest side neighborhood. It's part of Duggan's revitalization program for the bankrupt city. Detroit has been working for years to deal with vacant and dangerous buildings, often by demolishing them. Last week, Duggan announced a program for revitalizing neighborhoods by rebuilding and refurbishing homes. Still standing: Many Detroit neighborhoods are full of dilapidated homes like these burnt-out shells . Urban renewal: The city will auction any homes that are salvageable to buyers who will renovate and repair them . Owners of uninhabited and dilapidated homes will be put on notice that their homes will be seized through legal action unless they begin work to fix them. Any homes that are salvageable will be auctioned. 'This is a historic change in Detroitâ€™s strategy in fighting blight,' Duggan said last week. 'We are getting away from this mindless process of demolishing everything thatâ€™s vacant. Whatâ€™s different is we are attacking the entire neighborhood at once.' The city is planning 'an extensive marketing campaign' to drum up interest in the auction. The auction is 'designed to get homes into hands of those who will fix them up quickly,' according to a press release. Duggan's program is modeled after a similar project he ran as the Wayne County prosecutor from 2001 to 2003, reports the Detroit News. That initiative saw 1,000 homes fixed up.","Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced a new auction website for Detroit's abandoned homes Monday afternoon .

"By . Ashley Collman . Social networking site Twitter unveiled the latest expansion to its San Francsico headquarters Monday, surprising workers with a log cabin right in the middle of the cafeteria. Twitter now occupies seven of the 11 floors in the 77-year-old SF mart building, and bought the 1800s homesteader cabin to go along with the cafeteria's forest theme. 'We've used the notion of the forest as a nice tie-in with Twitter and its bird logo,' office designer Olle Lundberg told MarinIj.com. Home, home on the Twitter range: An 1800s log cabin was unveiled in Twitter's new cafeteria headquarters on Monday . Decked out: The interior of the cabin features seating for workers to eat lunch and TV monitors for entertainment . Farm to table: Twitter's office designer purchased the century-old cabin for an undisclosed amount from a local contractor who salvages them from remote Montana ranches . Growing: Twitter now occupies seven of the 11 floors in the 77-year-old SF Mart building . The unveiling alco coincided with the 149-year anniversary of the day President Abraham Lincoln was shot - perhaps the most famous person to have lived in a log cabin. The president was born in a one-room cabin in Kentucky and Lincoln Logs, the children's building blocks, are named after him. The timing of the unveiling seems to have been a coincidence. Mr Lundberg purchased the log cabin from a Novato, California contractor who salvages them from remote Montana ranches. 'We advertised them for a year and we pretty much got a lot of crackpot calls,' contractor Karl Beckmann said. 'When you think about it, buying a 100-year-old log cabin that has been exposed to the elements is not a very practical idea unless you're doing something exactly like what is being done here.' While the price of the cabin was never released, Tech Crunch found a 'more down market version' selling for around $12,500. Bird feeders: The log cabin is part of Twitter's new cafeteria . Perks: The company fuels its employees with healthy foods, as evidenced by the granola bar . Fun office: Other features of the headquarters include a yoga studio, rooftop garden and arcade. Above, another view of the new cafeteria . The 20x20-foot cabin was reassembled in the cafeteria without its roof to add intimacy and a space for workers to eat lunch. The cabin was outfitted with booths and a center pillar with TV monitors and a coffee station. 'You can see the hand of the original craftsmen who built them,' Mr Lundberg said. 'It's kind of cool that cabins that were built sometime in the 1800s have now reappeared. The guys who built them are long dead, of course, but are sort of still here. I kind of like that.' Other features of the company's headquarters include a yoga studio, rooftop garden and arcade.","The log cabin was one of the latest additions to the company's headquarters in the SF Mart building in downtown San Francisco .

"By . Alex Greig . The principal of a Delaware middle school and her 10-year-old daughter have been killed in a car accident. Delaware State police and the Milford School District confirmed that 42-year-old Tricia Martin of Camden died at Christiana Hospital following the 10:40pm crash Friday near Frederica. Her daughter Taryn Martin was pronounced dead at 12:45am Sunday at A.I. Dupont Children's Hospital. Martin was the beloved principal of Milford Central Academy, which has more than 1,000 students in 6th through 8th grades. Tragic accident: Taryn (left) and her mother Tricia Martin (right) both died after a car accident Friday night . Unexplained: The mother and daughter were driving home around 10:20pm Friday night when their vehicle veered into the oncoming lane . According to the News Journal, Tricia Martin was driving a 2009 Acura MDX SUV westbound when her car crossed over into the eastbound lanes and veered off the road into a ditch, hitting a telephone box and fence. 'For unknown reasons the Acura crossed over the eastbound lanes and off the south side of the roadway where it drove along a ditch line, colliding with a telephone box and fence,' said police spokesperson Gary Fournier. It then hit an embankment and flipped onto its side back onto the road in the eastbound lane. Tricia Martin was in the car and her daughter got out to get help from a vehicle that had pulled over when another car hit both Taryn Martin and the Acura, pushing the car into the ditch and flipping it upright. Beloved principal: Tricia Martin had worked for the school district for 12 years . Makeshift: A memorial sprang up Sunday at Tricia Martin's parking spot at the school after students and friends heard about the accident that claimed the lives of the mother and daughter . Dedicated: Tricia Martin was known as a fantastic principal who knew each of her students' names . Tricia Martin was ejected from the car onto the road and Taryn Martin was thrown onto the side of the road. The driver of the second vehicle was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries. Milford superintendent Phyllis Kohel says Martinâ€™s death is 'heartbreaking' for the school district. According to Delaware Online, school faculty met Sunday to prepare for the first day of school without the principal. 'There are still a lot of heavy hearts in there,' Marvin Schelhouse, president of the Milford School Board, said. 'It's going to be very tough between now and the day of the funeral.'

"By . Alex Greig . A mother and son have died in their Orange, New Jersey home in a fire overnight. Tanji Dewberry, 37, and her son Evan Ogando Soler, eight, were pronounced dead at the scene. Neighbors and friends outside the home expressed shock over the loss of Dewberry, a vice president at the WL Ross investment firm on Wall Street in New York and a children’s author whose first book, 'Oh Fiddlesticks!' was published last year. Tragic deaths: Tanji Dewberry and her son Evan Soler, eight, were killed when a fire ripped through their home last night . Police say the fire ripped through the home on Berkely Avenue around 11:30pm Sunday. A passerby noticed smoke and flames emerging from the house and knocked on the front door to alert the residents, but upon receiving no response called 911. 'When we arrived, we found the building was completely sealed up and the companies forced the front door in and went inside to attack the fire,' Orange Fire Director Michael Down told CBS New York. 'Unfortunately, we found two victims.' House fire: The house had broken window panes and burnt and blackened frames from the deadly fire . 'Big heart': Neighbors say Evan Soler was 'full of joy' and would have a lemonade stand outside his home every summer . Bereft: Evan Soler's father Virgilio Soler was inconsolable outside the home where his son died . Investigators say an electrical fire in the boy's bedroom is likely to blame for the blaze. Both bodies were found in the boy's room, and it is believed Dewberry was attempting to rescue her son when they both succumbed to the smoke. Virgilio Soler, the child's father, did not live with Dewberry and their son, but was outside the home this morning speaking to investigators. 'I just feel empty, he was the world to me,' the heartbroken father told CBS New York. 'I don’t know if it’s something I’ll ever be able to overcome.' Neighbors gathered outside the home this morning, shocked and devastated by the loss of the mother and son. Devoted mom: Seen here with her son as an infant, Tanji Dewberry was known as a dedicated and loving mother . Accomplished: In addition to being a finance executive, Tanji Dewberry authored a children's book and had planned a follow-up this summer . 'Mom was an outgoing mom, she did everything she could for this child,' neighbor Julie Antoine told CBS New York. 'He was outgoing, high honor student, very joyful. Had a beautiful heart.' Dewberry was inspired by her son, who suffered from ADHD, to write her book, which aimed to help families and children to develop strategies to cope with the condition. She had planned a follow-up book this summer and had been interviewed about her work on WLNY's morning show, 'Live From the Couch' to speak about it. During the interview, she explained that Evan was coping magnificently and was on the honor role and competed in the district spelling bee. Neighbors said Evan Soler would have a lemonade stand in the neighborhood every summer, helped by his mother. 'Tanji was an absolutely amazing, driven beautiful person and a terrific mother to Evan,' Nyle Washington, a publicist who worked with Dewberry on the book told NJ.com. 'Her fierce love of her son showed in every page. I'm truly saddened by this news.'","Tanji Dewberry, 37, and her eight-year-old son Evan Soler perished in a fire in their Orange, New Jersey home .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The highest-ranking female NYPD chief has revealed how she stepped in to become mother to the sole survivor of 1984's horrific Palm Sunday Massacre. On that tragic day, Officer Joanne Jaffe took a blood-covered 13-month-old baby girl from a pile of bodies that included her mother, brothers and cousins. Thirty years later, that child--31-year-old Christina Rivera--can officially call Jaffe her mom. Family: The NYPD's highest ranking woman Joanne Jaffe, right, has opened up about her newly adopted daughter Christina Rivera (at left today, aged 31) --the girl she plucked from an horrific murder scene in 1984 . Though to hear the little known tale . is to understand that Jaffe became a mother the moment she laid eyes on . that helpless little girl. 'I was assigned to her and fell in love with her,' Chief Jaffe recently told the New York Times. Jaffe . is now Chief of Housing and the top-ranking woman in the NYPD. Back . then, she was one of the first officers to respond a tortured scene in . Brooklyn on April 15, 1984. It . was the worst mass slaying New York had seen in decades. Ten lay dead . after a cocaine addict named Christopher Thomas opened fire killing . Christina Rivera's 20-year-old mother, her 3- and 5-year-old half . brothers, and several of her cousins. Journey to motherhood: Now the highest ranking woman in the NYPD, Chief Joanne Jaffe (left) was just a beat cop when she responded to what became known as the Palm Sunday Massacre in 1984. Thirty years and a lot of tears later, she adopted the only survivor of the Brooklyn mass slaying, the now 31-year-old Christina Rivera (right) Gruesome: A cocaine addict named Christopher Thomas gunned down 10 women and children including Rivera's 20-year-old mother and two half brothers in what was New York's most gruesome mass slaying in decades . Rivera's mother Carmen Perez still held the food she'd been feeding little Christina. But the young mom would never feed her 13-month-old daughter again. Jaffe picked up Rivera from the carnage and has never really put her down. 'I can’t imagine my life without her,' Rivera told the Times. 'She taught me what it was like to hope and to truly trust.' Jaffe asked to take the girl home on the day of the gruesome massacre but Rivera was instead sent to a foster home for the night. She would subsequently be reunited with her father and sent to live with her grandmother. For years Jaffe would visit to give Rivera toys and her grandmother a little extra cash. At the time, Rivera knew her only as that funny police lady and knew nothing of her own tragic past until age 10. By the time she was in her teens, Rivera would become increasingly moody and too much for her aging grandparents to handle. They asked Jaffe and her soon-to-be husband to take her, and they consented. Rivera would come and go from the home as tensions between her and Jaffe's husband--who Rivera saw as competing for her new mother's attentions--grew. Palm Sunday Massacre: A 1984 New York Post cover depicts the wrenching moment Joanne Jaffe held 13-month-old Christina Rivera in the back of a squad car. Rivera managed to survive a barrage of bullets that took the lives of 10 in East New York . Rivera spent some time living with her father but never really stopped thinking of Jaffe as her mom. While she was still a kid, Jaffe promised to adopt Rivera but it never came to fruition. 'I felt very orphaned, if that makes sense, even though my mom was still my mom and still there for me,' said Rivera, who's now a state worker and auxilliary police officer in New York. 'It was almost like I wanted to be claimed, like, ""I’m her daughter, I belong to her.”' It wasn't until after Rivera's grandmother's death, a deeply painful event for her, that Jaffe would finally fulfil her promise. 'I’d seen her ups and downs in life and I said I owe it to this kid,' Jaffe told the Times. 'I’d promised her as a kid and I never followed through. I thought this is what she needs if that hole in herself is ever going to be filled.' Fated: A 'for rent' sign hangs in this Google Street View image of the East New York, Brooklyn home where 10 were slain 30 years ago.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . President Barack Obama has used the White House Easter prayer breakfast as an opportunity to pay tribute to the three people killed at over the weekend. The President said no one should have to worry about their security while gathering with their fellow believers before noting that synagogues and temples across the country are taking extra security precautions following the shooting. 'No one should ever have to fear for their safety when they go to pray,' he said at the Monday event. The president spoke during an Easter prayer breakfast at the White House and vowed that the government would provide whatever is needed to support the investigation. Scroll down for video . Reflective: President Obama held the annual Easter prayer breakfast on Monday and used the platform as a way to address the religious attack that took place over the weekend and left three dead . Tragic: The prayer breakfast came the day after three people were killed Sunday when a gunman opened fire on a Jewish community center and Jewish retirement complex near Kansas City . He urged Americans to stand united against 'religious-based' violence. 'As Americans, we not only need to open our hearts to the families of the victims, we've got to stand united against this kind of terrible violence, which has no place in our society,' Obama said. 'We have to keep coming together, across faiths to combat the ignorance and the intolerance, including anti-Semitism that can lead to hate groups and violence because we are all children of God.' Three people were killed Sunday when a gunman opened fire on a Jewish community center and Jewish retirement complex near Kansas City. Spiritual: The annual breakfast continued a tradition that Obama started in 2010 and is different than the annual prayer breakfast that involves Congress at the beginning of the legislative year . Entertainment: The President turned around to watch the Washington Performing Arts Society's Children of the Gospel choir . Welcome visitor: President Barack Obama greets Dr. Joel C. Hunter, senior pastor of Northland, A Church Distributed, in Longwood, Florida who was at the Monday service . The man accused in the shooting is a . well-known white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan leader who was once . the subject of a nationwide manhunt. Officials were investigating the attack as a hate crime, although two of the victims, a man and his grandson, were not Jewish and were at the community center for a singing competition, relatives said. Obama said the fact that the attack came as Jews prepare to celebrate Passover and Christians prepare for Easter makes the tragedy 'all the more painful.' The president also recalled his meeting at the Vatican with Pope Francis last month. Twice in five days: The President spoke at Al Sharpton's annual convention on Friday and then the Reverend was also one of the spiritual leaders to be invited to the White House this morning (pictured) Breakfast offering: The guests  dined on mini bagels with lox and cream cheese and fruit parfait . Obama said the pope's message of justice and inclusion, especially for the poor, is a reminder to live righteously and humbly. The breakfast was attended by faith leaders including Al Sharpton, African Methodist Episcopal Church Bishop Vashti Murphy Mckenzie and Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. They were treated to a performance by Washington Performing Arts Society's Children of the Gospel Choir and dined on mini bagels with lox and cream cheese and fruit parfait.

"By . Associated Press . Michael Phelps is coming out of retirement, the first step toward possibly swimming at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The 22-time Olympic medalist will compete for the first time since the 2012 London Games at a meet in Mesa, Arizona on April 24-26. Bob Bowman, the swimmer's longtime coach, told The Associated Press on Monday that Phelps is entered in three events â€” the 50- and 100-meter freestyles and the 100 butterfly. Making waves: Michael Phelps is due to compete in his first race since the 2012 London Olympic games . 'I think he's just going to test the waters a little bit and see how it goes,' Bowman said by phone from Baltimore. 'I wouldn't say it's a full-fledged comeback.' Phelps returned to training last fall and re-entered the U.S. drug-testing program. He has completed his six-month waiting period by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to be eligible for competition. Bowman said Phelps is 'pretty far' from being back in top form. He's been training Monday through Friday with Bowman's team at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. 'He's gotten back into good shape since September,' the coach said. 'He can give a good effort and certainly not be embarrassed. He's in enough shape to swim competitively.' Besides Phelps, USA Swimming said Olympians Ryan Lochte and Katie Ledecky are among those expected to swim in the Arena Grand Prix at Skyline Aquatic Center. Back on the fly: Phelps, seen here at the London Games, is signed up to compete in three shorter races at a Mesa, Arizona meet later this month including the 100m butterfly . Phelps turns 29 in June and is the winningest and most decorated athlete in Olympic history. He captured 18 gold medals and 22 medals overall at the last three Summer Games. He broke Mark Spitz's record for a single Olympics by winning eight gold medals at Beijing in 2008. Phelps had vowed that he wouldn't swim into his 30s. His camp is being low key about the comeback. 'I think he's just really enjoying it,' Bowman said. 'He enjoys the training and being physically fit. He just kind of wants to see where he's at. It's more really for fun. It's been nice for me to see him swim just for the joy of it really.' In Mesa, Phelps will swim 100 free and 100 fly preliminaries on the first day. Then, if he qualifies, he'll decide which race to swim for the evening finals, Bowman said. He'll swim the 50 free on the second day and might swim the 50 fly 'just for fun,' the coach added. Timing: Former teammate Ryan Lochte (seen competing against one another in 2012) will also be getting back in the pool at the Mesa meet, suggesting that they are both ramping up to compete in 2016 . Phelps will stick to the shorter races and some relays rather than the grueling individual medleys he swam during the height of his career. 'He's really doing this because he wants to â€” there's no outside pressure at all,' Bowman said. Phelps has already entered the remaining Grand Prix meets in Charlotte, North Carolina in May and Santa Clara, California in June, although Bowman said no decision has been made on whether he will compete. Depending on his early results, Phelps could compete in the U.S. National Championships in August in Irvine, California where teams will be selected for the 2015 world championships. 'I wouldn't say it's 100 percent on the radar,' Bowman said. 'After Mesa, we're going to sit down and talk about it.'","Michael Phelps will compete in a Mesa, Arizona meet later this month .

"By . Ruth Styles . For many women, pregnancy is a joyful time. But for Jenna, a mother-of-one from southern California, the experience proved to be tougher than she ever could have imagined. Instead of happily preparing for the arrival of her second child, Jenna, who was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder at the age of 12, was plagued with anxiety and paralysed by her fear of getting ill - a fear that left her a virtual recluse. Now the brave mother has appeared on TLC documentary, Pregnant and OCD, to reveal what living with constant anxiety while expecting is really like. Nerves: Jenna, pictured while pregnant with her second child, was left a virtual recluse because of OCD . 'My OCD was first diagnosed when I was about 12 or 13 years old,' she explains. 'My thoughts and worries are always there - they're constant. 'I have a fear mostly of illness, so I avoid going out for fear of picking up one of the illnesses that are going around.' As a result, Jenna spends most of her time at home and refuses to let her two-year-old son Dominic go to the park for fear of germs. 'We spend most of the days in the house,' she reveals. 'Most mothers love bringing their kids to the park but I think about the germs that are on [the slide] and that shoes have touched it. To me, the park represents a dirty place.' For husband Josh, Jenna's OCD and the impact it has on their son is a constant source of concern. Fearful: Jenna's fears include a terror of illness and of dirt, and as a result, she constantly washes her hands . Uncomfortable: Jenna, pictured with mother Gloria, was unable to enjoy her baby shower for fear of illness . 'The OCD is a lot worse [since she became pregnant] and it's really . stressful,' he explains. 'She's turned Dominic into a bubble boy and she doesn't really . want him doing anything. 'He doesn't understand what's going on in Mummy's head.' 'I would definitely say the . OCD has kept me in a prison,' adds Jenna. 'My thoughts and my fears that have to do . with OCD become much worse with pregnancy. 'I've pretty much confined myself to the house except for when I need to go out. I worry about diseases like the Swine Flu. I wash my hands too many times to count.' Although Jenna usually takes medication to control her symptoms, she refused to do so while pregnant - an attitude that also extended to the period spent breastfeeding when baby son Damien was born. 'Newborns are less protected so I worry . about all that stuff,' she explains. 'I don't want to breastfeed and take that . medication at the same time. Concern: Since becoming a mother for the second time, Jenna has vowed to start taking medication again . Frightening: Jenna's OCD has made her reluctant to allow interaction between her two young sons . 'The doctors say that lots of people do and . they're fine but I'm unsure.' Her OCD even has an impact on the interaction she allows between her sons, with Dominic regarded as a potential source of infection. 'When . Dominic is interacting with Damien, I don't really like him to touch . his face with his hands,' she admits. 'He might have germs on his hands.' Since having Damien, however, the mother-of-two has made it her mission to overcome the disease for the sake of her sons and has started a new course of medication - despite being fearful of the effect it could have on her children. 'I want to get better and I'm trying to,' she explains. 'I hope that when the medication starts working, I'm going to feel a lot happier and less anxious.' Normal: Jenna and husband Josh are desperate to give their sons as normal an upbringing as possible . 'When she was pregnant I didn't think it could get any worse than what it was before, but it has,' adds husband Josh. 'I hope Dominic and Damien will be able to do what other boys do and go . outside and get dirty and messy like little boys do.' 'I . don't want my boys to see the world as a place that's full of threats,' says Jenna. 'I . don't want them to worry about things like I do. 'I want them to see the . world as a good place and I just want them to be happy.' Jenna and Josh appear on Pregnant and OCD, tonight at 9pm on TLC .","Jenna, a mother-of-two from southern California, has OCD .

"By . Joel Christie . A Brooklyn man who was falsely imprisoned for 25 years for a murder he didn't commit wants one million dollars for the every year the state kept him behind bars and away from his family. Derrick Deacon, who walked free last year after new evidence surfaced in his case, has filed a $25 million lawsuit that he hopes will set a new precedent for how authorities handle investigations and force convictions. The 58-year-old is undergoing therapy to help acclimate to the 'new world' and deal with the loss of family members, including his mother, who died when he was in prison. Deacon was jailed the 1989 for the shooting death of a teenager during a robbery in a Flatbush apartment complex. Quarter of a century lost: Brooklyn man Derrick Deacon, 58, spent 25 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit. After walking free in November after a retrial quashed his conviction, he is suing New York for $25 million for what happened to him . However at his retrial in 2012, a witness . recanted her original testimony, saying police or district attorney . investigators had threatened her. Colleen Campbell had told investigators Deacon was not the man she saw fleeing in a stairwell after the shooting, but she was coached to give vague testimony at trial, with authorities threatening to take her children if she didn't cooperate, according to The New York Post. 'These people have to pay for every day they made me suffer behind the wall for no reason,' Deacon told The Post. Deacon's retrial was granted after a Jamaican gang member came forward saying members of a rival gang had killed the victim, 16-year-old Anthony Wynn. Then Campbell took back her statements. '[Police] told Campbell that she was in trouble for leaving the children unattended and that the children would be taken away unless she accompanied them to the District Attorney's Office,' says the suit, filed by Deacon's defense attorney, Glenn Garber. 'Concerned about losing her children, and also afraid that the true killer would seek retribution against her, Campbell did what she was told and falsely testified at trial that she was unsure whether the person she saw was or was not Mr. Deacon.' A Brooklyn Supreme Court jury in November deliberated just nine minutes before acquitting Deacon. Once he was released, Deacon celebrated with a feast of chicken wings and chili at Tribeca's Mudville Saloon . Deacon is now seeing a therapist to cope with being back in what he calls 'the new world'. Integral things like cellphones and internet were all created when he was in prison. He recalled the bittersweet moment he heard the not-guilty verdict. 'I was excited but sad at the same time. 'Sad, in a way, about the one person that I really care about, my mom, my baby's mom and my aunts. 'They all died while I was in there. I missed seeing my kids grow up,' Deacon said, adding he would use any money he was awarded to help his family. 'I got kids, grandkids I want to send to college because I never had the opportunity to do that for my children. 'I have friends behind the wall still suffering, and I'd like to help them, too.' A spokeswoman for the state attorney general declined to comment on the suit.","Derrick Deacon was wrongly convicted in the 1989 shooting murder of a 16-year-old .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Two men have been found dead in the Hudson River after one either fell or jumped into the river and the second jumped in after him. Police have identified the two men as Elias Serrano and Edwin Cruz who are both from Newark, which is about 10 miles from the area where they were found. They were with a group of friends near the Eighth Street pier before police were called to the scene at 5.35am on Sunday. Searching for clues: Police and scuba crews from New York and New Jersey responded to a 5.30am call on Sunday morning and their bodies were found after a 90 minute search . One friend said that he had realized Serrano, 20, was in the water and moments later Cruz, 24, jumped in after him. The friend, Angel Duran, would not tell NJ.com if Serrano purposefully jumped in the water. The father of another friend said how Cruz had just spoken with him shortly before the incident. 'At 4:30 a.m. I spoke with Edwin and he told me he was looking after my son,' Peter Baez said. 'Thirty minutes later I got a call from my son, who was shaken and scared. He told me something had happened. 'I've known them for over 20 years. I used to live in Newark. This is a terrible tragedy. They were both starting out.' Skeptical: One of the victim's brothers did not believe that his brother would have purposefully jumped in the water . NBC New York reports that the NYPD scuba unit spent 90 minutes in the water before finding the bodies at 7.55am and 8.10am. Hoboken police said that the incident is still underway but have ruled out foul play, according to NJ.com. The cause of death for both Cruz and Serrano is said to be drowning but the reason why they were in the water in the first place has yet to be determined. 'I question what the police are telling me,' Serrano's brother Ricardo Morales said. 'Something must've happened. My brother was a good kid. He was studying to be an electrical technician and worked at warehouse,' he told NJ.com. Morales was one of Serrano's nine siblings who were at the police department when next of his death was confirmed. Their mother collapsed in grief and had to be rushed to a local hospital to be treated with oxygen.","Elias Serrano and Edwin Cruz were both found dead in the Hudson River in the early hours of Sunday morning .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . Two California men that are registered sex offenders have been arrested in connection to four murders across Orange County. Franc Cano, 27, was arrested around 6pm on Friday in Anaheim. Steven Dean Gordon, 45, was arrested around 7pm, according to CBSLA. Lt. Bob Dunn told the station that the investigation began on March 14, when police investigated a woman's body found at on a conveyor belt at Republic Waste Services. Scroll down for video . Suspects: Franc Cano, left, and Steven Dean Gordon, right, were arrested in connection to four murders across Orange County . Victim: A joint investigation was launched when Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, pictured, was found dead on a conveyor belt at a trash site . The 21-year-old woman, later identified as Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, reportedly worked as a sex worker in Anaheim. Prior to her arrival in Orange County, Estepp appeared in web videos examining sex work and street life in Oklahoma, the LA Times reports. Estepp's death was linked by authorities to three women who went missing in Santa Ana between October and November of last year. They include Kianna Jackson, 20, Josephine Vargas, 34, and Martha Anaya, 28. All three women reportedly had ties to prostitution. Authorities continue to search for more potential victims, Dunn said. 'There is a possibility there are more victims, and we are and have been working with many jurisdictions throughout California as well as the rest of the United States,' he told the LA Times. 'We need to make sure that our net is wide so we can see if there are any other missing persons that might have ended up in California.' What happened? Kianna Jackson, pictured, went missing in October 2013 . Josephine Vargas, pictured, was last seen in October 2013 as well . Martha Anaya, pictured, was last seen in Santa Ana in November 2013 . Estepp's body was reportedly recovered from Republic Waste Services, pictured . Murdered? Estepp, pictured, reportedly worked as a sex worker in Anaheim and was featured in a series of videos examining Oklahoma street life . Cano and Gordon were both registered sex offenders and convicted of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 in 2007 and 1992, respectively, according to the LA Times. Both men were sentenced to three years in prison. As registered sex offenders, the paper adds that the men were ordered to wear GPS monitors and were reportedly required to check in with authorities every 30 days due to their transient status. Gordon and Cano reportedly knew each other in April 2012, the paper says, when they cut off their GPS monitors and fled to Nevada. They used the aliases Dexter McCoy and Joseph Madrid before they were arrested. Both men pled guilty for failing to register as sex offenders. They are currently held in custody at an Orange County jail, according to CBSLA. A press conference is scheduled for Monday.","Franc Cano, 27, and Steven Dean Gordon, 45, were arrested on Friday in Anaheim .

"By . James King . 'Idiot.' That was the common reaction of the majority of his teammates after the entire El Paso Chihuahuas baseball team convinced former Atlanta Braves slugger - and current Chihuahuas outfielder - Jeff Francoeur that another one of their teammates was deaf. Not only did they convince Francoeur that pitcher Jorge Reyes was deaf, but they did so for an entire month - and videotaped the entire prank. The hilarious video explains the great lengths to which the team went to keep the gag going - and their disbelief that Francoeur is dumb enough to buy into it due to the simple fact that it would be incredibly hard for a baseball player - a pitcher, no less - to be deaf and play baseball. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Got ya: This is the moment Jeff Francoeur (center) realized his entire team had been lying to him for over a month . Veteran: Francoeur has played for five MLB teams and won the Gold Glove in 2007 . Not deaf: Reyes' wife told Francoeur that the two communicated by text message and 'hand signals' - and he bought it . In an interview with Francoeur shown in the film, he's asked what it's been like to play with Reyes. 'It's been a lot of fun to play with Jorge,' he says. 'He's overcome obviously a lot. Being a deaf baseball player is very hard in this game and to see the way he's done it and handled himself has been awesome.' The very next scene is Reyes. 'Hello, my name is Jorge Reyes and I'm definitely not deaf,' Reyes explains. Teammates then share with the filmmaker - first-baseman Cody Decker - some hilarious examples of how Francoeur getting duped by Reyes. Team manager Pat Murphy told a story about how someone on the team yelled 'heads up' and everyone reacted except Reyes. Mockery: Francoeur's teammates joke about the hand signals and over enunciation of words he would often use to communicate with Reyes . 'Idiot': Infielder Ryan Jackson seemed genuinely disappointed in how much of an 'idiot' Francoeur was to believe Reyes was deaf . 'God, it's amazing - [Reyes] is the only one who didn't move,' Murphy quotes Francoeur as saying after the incident. In another example, Francoeur asks Murphy how Reyes communicates with the catcher - an important aspect of pitching at any level. 'He just mouths words to him,' Murphy explained. In one of the more unbelievable instances where Francoeur didn't realize Reyes wasn't deaf happened at a restaurant when he met Reyes, Reyes' wife and some other players for dinner. Baker explains that he had to tip the waitress serving the group extra to get her to act like Reyes was deaf as long as Francoeur was in the restaurant. At one point, Francoeur asked Reyes' wife how she communicates with her husband. She told him they communicated through text messages and 'hand signals.' 'Hand signals. Not even sign language. Hand signals,' Decker jokes. Roll credits: Decker produced the hilarious video and put it on Youtube where it already has had more than 400,000 views . Good sport: Francoeur managed to laugh at himself a little bit after he was let in on the big secret . The end of the video shows the big reveal: The team is gathered in the clubhouse watching the video Decker had compiled of the prank as Francoeur is sitting in the middle of the group. When the video gets to the part where Reyes says 'Hello, my name is Jorge Reyes and I'm definitely not deaf,' Francoeur turns beat red as all of his teammates laugh hysterically. Francoeur recently signed a contract with the San Diego Padres and was assigned to the club's AAA team, the Chihuahuas. He's played for five Major League Baseball teams, including the Atlanta Braves and the New York Mets. In 2007, he won the Gold Glove Award.","Jeff Franoeur is a 2007 Gold Glove winner who has played on five MLB teams .

"By . Alex Greig . A Seattle nurse has been accused of refilling morphine syringes with water to hide thefts of the drug. Kelly Schwartz, 35, is facing federal charges stemming from allegations she stole morphine and similar opiate painkillers and refilled syringes with a saline solution at the EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland. Patients were placed at risk of overdose and death by the thefts, when their dosages were increased by doctors after the diluted painkillers failed to ease their pain. Position of trust: Schwartz is accused of stealing drugs intended for her patients, many of whom were recovering from surgery or serious illness . Kelly had worked at EvergreenHealth since August 2009 in the progressive care unit, caring for patients recovering from heart attack, stroke and surgery. According to Seattle PI, a pharmacy technician noticed loose caps on syringes stored in the unit's pharmacy in 2012. Tests later revealed that they were so highly diluted that the morphine levels were 'barely detectable.' After an internal investigation, the hospital identified Schwartz as the suspect and confronted the nurse. Seattle PI reports that Schwartz admitted the thefts after being accused by hospital staff in March 2012 and was immediately fired. Diluted: Analysis found the syringes Schwartz is believed to have tampered with to contain just traces of morphine . Investigators with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration interviewed Schwartz, who told them she had become addicted to prescription painkillers following a back injury in 2009 and began stealing pain pills from patients after returning to work. She hid the thefts by overstating about her patients' dosage on hospital charts. She began stealing injectable morphine in 2011 after returning from maternity leave, diluting the drug and causing her patients to suffer with their pain without the help of the medicine that they had been prescribed. 'I tried not to think about it,' Schwartz told the agent, reports Seattle PI. She has been charged with product tampering and was arrested in her home last Thursday. She is currently free on bond.","Kelly Schwartz, 35, is accused of stealing opiate painkillers from the Seattle hospital where she worked .

"By . Wills Robinson . Tragedy: Talented student Blake Ayling, 20, died while walking across a rail yard after a college party . The parents of a student who died while crossing a railway line after a college party are suing his fraternity, claiming they should not have served their son alcohol. Blake Ayling was killed while walking through Grand Forks Rail Yard, North Dakota, when he became tangled in a moving train. An autopsy revealed the 20-year-old, who was on the University of North Dakota's Roll of Honor, was drunk when he bled to death after tearing his arm. According to the Grand Forks Herald, his parents, Corey and Robin, are arguing the chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha contributed to their son's death in March 2012. The . pair are also suing BNSF Railways, suggesting the company knew students . used the yard as a shortcut, but failed to put up adequate warning . signs. According to . his room mate, the talented business student would routinely use the . rail yard as a short cut to his student apartment. On the night of the horrifying incident, he had attended a jersey party which required partygoers to wear sports shirts. The . complaint says IDs were not properly checked and some students signed . the party’s guestbook under fake names such as 'Bob Saget' and 'Hannah Montana'. Mr Ayling is thought to have left the . party around 1 a.m. His jersey and backpack were found in the . fraternity’s basement and were turned over to police a few days later. His . parents also suggested the railway company knew people used the yard as . a quicker route home to the college campus, but failed to use gates or . fences to deter people from crossing. Scene: The talented student walked across the Grand Forks rail yard as a shortcut to his campus flat . Fraternity: The talented student had attended a party at Pi Kappa Alpha on the University's campus. His parents are now suing the organisation, claiming alcohol served at the party led to his death . They added in the lawsuit there were no warning signs near the dangerous area and no preventative measures such as fences were bordering the yard. 'While entirely foreseeable, BNSF failed to acknowledge, consider, appreciate or act on the fact that its rail yard is in effect a silent lethal killing field in the middle of a concentrated population,' the complaint reads. He was a sophomore from Minneapolis . working toward a major in entrepreneurship, according to the university. He was on the President’s Roll of Honor and the Dean’s List. At the time of his death, police determined it was an accident.","Ben Ayling, 20, died when crossing Grand Forks Rail yard in North Dakota .

She may have shot to fame on Made In Chelsea as a self-proclaimed 'player' known for her hilariously cutting rejections and cold-hearted attitude but Lucy Watson says she has a more sensitive side and wants her fans to see that. The 24-year-old reality TV star has opened her heart and penned a dating guide, which she promises will be the modern girl’s no-holds-barred guide to 21st century dating, relationships and break-ups. Speaking to MailOnline about The Dating Game, she said: 'I haven't seen any book out there for girls, it's ridiculous. I've had quite a few relationships at a young age and I wish I'd had someone to give me advice. My book is like an older sister.' Dating guru: Lucy Watson, who shot to fame on Made In Chelsea, has penned a new dating guide to help women 'find strength' and avoid being played . Lucy promises that her £12.99 book will give you the answers that your friends can’t, many of them learnt the hard way, as well as rules for first dates, social media, playing hard to get and relationship do’s and don’ts. 'I've learnt a lot and I want to give women the strength to do the right things. There's some funny stories in there from my past experiences and it's all extremely open and honest.' Big sister: Lucy promises that her £12.99 book will give you the answers that your friends can't - many of them learned the hard way - and will act like your 'big sister' While she appears thick-skinned on the E4 show, Lucy says that she's been left broken-hearted by past relationships. 'I have stayed in horrendous relationships,' she confessed. 'I've endured years of crying, losing weight, low confidence and ruined myself. I wish I had been stronger. 'I wish I had realised the right time to say to someone, ""No, you're not good enough."" 'I'm actually a real romantic at heart and I'll do whatever it takes to be with someone that I love.' The book, which will hit shelves on May 22, will guide readers through the perilous world of first dates, falling in love, break-ups and the emotional minefield of exes, but most importantly how a strong woman playing the game should never be played - something Lucy now knows all about. 'Guys are really crafty and good at trickery; I don't want girls to fall for that,' she said. Sharing her top tips for pulling a guy, Lucy said: 'A guy should always approach a girl and desperation is the biggest turn-off ever. 'Meet a guy somewhere other than in a club, you can't hear what they're saying and they're only interested in what you look like. 'Less is definitely more and caked on make-up is not attractive.' One relationship Lucy is bound to open up about in the book is her on-off fling with co-star Jamie Laing. On Wednesday's episode the pair had a heated discussion about the Candy Kitten’s entrepreneur’s recent behaviour. You big flirt! Lucy, pictured with on-off lover Jamie Laing, as well as Proudlock and Mark Francis, said she always knew that Jamie wasn't the right guy for her . Meeting . in a local café, a disgruntled Lucy had plenty to say about Jamie’s . indiscretions during a trip to Miami with pal Spencer. ‘You said you loved me and you acted . in a completely different way,’ she said. ‘I know if I said I loved . someone I wouldn’t make another gesture and go away and sleep with other . girls.’ Jamie responded: ‘I completely appreciate that me going to Miami and sleeping with another girl is going to hurt you.' Lucy added: ‘You shouldn’t throw around the word love.’ Jamie looked bemused: ‘Why not?’ She replied: ‘Because you shouldn’t say it if you don’t mean it.’ Bright future: Lucy, pictured with Cheska Hull and Louise Thompson, has dreams of having her own TV show . Lucy tells us that she always knew it was never meant to be. 'It wasn't a relationship with Jamie, it was more of a fling. I always knew he wasn't the guy I wanted to be with and he proved me right.' Lucy is currently single and 'trying to date', describing her perfect man as 'someone nice, tall, dark, handsome and amazing.' She admits she hasn't met any nice male celebrities because they all have 'huge egos' but would love to land a date with 'incredible' Brad Pitt. Aside from penning her debut tome, Lucy has been working on her jewellery line, filming for Made In Chelsea most days and planning for the future. 'I want to stay in the industry and being on MIC has taught me loads about working behind-the-scenes producing and directing, which I love, so maybe one day I will look into that. 'I also love presenting and would love to have my own show,' she said. Welcome to The Dating Game, people. Way too often, girls fall for . players who they know are going to screw them over, or they throw . themselves at guys and wonder why they've never heard from them again, . or they stay in dead-­end relationships because they are too scared of . being alone. These girls aren't strangers, they're me, they're my . friends, they're all of us. But it's not our fault. Dating nowadays is . seriously complicated and the more attached we get to someone the more . confusing it seems to become. That's why I decided to write this book. It's taken a lot of long and painful lessons for me to work out how to . play the dating game and I've often wished someone could have just told . me the rules from the start, before I had to learn them the hard way. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I've mastered them all or that . I've got a perfect track record. In fact, as you will find out in this . book, my experience of cheats, double betrayals and public scandals . makes my record far from ideal! But the dating mistakes I've made and . the experiences I've had to go through have taught me that I won't put . up with anybody who doesn't treat me the way I deserve, ever again. I am . never going to settle for just any guy that comes along… it's got to be . the right guy. And, hopefully after reading my book, neither will you. It's about time that we learned how to play men at their own game. In . The Dating Game, I've hopefully covered all the bases, from being . single, to going on first dates and figuring out if he's that . interested, to making a relationship work and even how to get over an . ex. I want to make sure that if we play the dating game properly none of . us will be played ever again.","£12.99 book, The Dating Game, hits shelves May 22 .

The 45-year-old star of the gangland drama Peaky Blinders says women who worry too much about their age and appearance have too much time on their hands. In an interview yesterday, the wife of Homeland actor Damian Lewis, 43, said many women were 'obsessed' with their weight and changing looks. Age doesn't matter: Helen McCrory, playing the matriarch Aunt Polly Gray, in BBC's Peaky Blinders . Instead, McCrory, who has also appeared in The Queen, Harry Potter and Skyfall, praised her parents for bringing her up with a sense that 'things like that just don't matter' and that her looks should never determine her self-worth. The mother-of-two, who lives in north London, told The Sunday Times Magazine: 'My attitude to ageing is all down to them. Never once did my mother comment on how another woman looked; she never said I was too skinny or too fat. 'Things like that just didn't matter! So many women are obsessed with their age and how they look. I just think: ""Sorry love, but you've obviously got too much time on your hands"".

She said: 'People go on about me getting these Mrs Robinson parts I keep saying to Damian, you're cast with a woman half your age, and nobody mentions it in the script. 'I only have to look at a younger man and the whole f***ing drama is about it.

"By . Lydia Warren . A panhandler has devised a creative way to raise cash - by entertaining motorists at a Tampa intersection while they wait for the lights to change. Jeff Stevens, who waits at the intersection of Dale Mabry Highway and Kennedy Boulevard, dances, twirls a cane and brandishes signs that he hopes tickle drivers into handing over change. 'Wife + pet tiger abducted. Need help w/ ransom to save my lovable tiger. They can have wife, so much quieter at home,' one sign reads. Thinking outside the box: Jeff Stevens performs and holds up creative signs for Tampa motorists . He has become somewhat of a local fixture after putting on his shows every Sunday. Stevens said he had originally held signs reading 'homeless' but realized he had to try something different when they failed to stir passersby into handing over donations. 'I started coming up with comedy things and trying to make people laugh,' he told Bay News 9. 'It just brightens their day.' He managed to get a full time job working at Denny's and moved into an apartment in 2011, but he still needed to perform to make ends meet. Having a laugh: He places signs along the roadside and hopes they tickle motorists into giving a donation . New approach: He said that he previously wrote 'homeless' on signs but that they never worked . He continues with his weekly performances in a bid to pay bills and start saving money. Now he has dreams of returning to what he used to do - traveling with the circus and performing with wild cats, he told Bay News 9. He told the channel he is related to Ron and Joy Holiday, who featured in HBO's documentary Cat Dancers and who hit headlines when their partner was killed by one of their tigers. But after he left the circus, his parents passed away and he clashed with the law - eventually bringing him to Florida and his intersection. Former career: He said he wants to work with a traveling circus - a job he previously had (pictured) Performance: Every weekend, he twirls a cane as cars wait for the lights to change at the intersection . And until he achieves his dream of getting back to the circus, he said he's happy to stay here putting on his shows. 'It blesses my heart to see them laughing,' he said of passersby. 'If I don't make a dollar or anything, it feels good right here just to see somebody smile.'","Jeff Stevens goes to the same Tampa intersection every Sunday and waits for the traffic to stop before dancing and twirling a cane .

"By . Scarlett Russell . Most of us would try to avoid coming face to face with anyone who’d hurt us. So the idea of meeting - and forgiving - your rapist is almost unthinkable. However this is just what one woman did, five years after she was raped by a 12-year-old pupil in 2004. In 2009, Jo Nodding met her attacker, looked him straight in the eye, and told him she had forgiven him. Now, five years later, Ms Nodding, a teacher from the north of England is appearing on a BBC3 documentary about the Restorative Justice system, Can Criminals Say Sorry? Five years after she was raped by a 12-year-old pupil in 2004, Jo Nodding met her attacker, looked him straight in the eye, and told him she had forgiven him . She opens up about her traumatic experience nine years ago which, she says, almost ruined her life entirely: ‘For months and months I didn’t live, I just survived. I didn’t want to go out. ‘For months and months afterwards I could still smell him. ‘If I was out and anybody looked at my personal space, I lost it. Ms Nodding was teaching the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, at their school when he attacked her. ‘It was a normal Monday morning and we’d been on our own for 10 minutes,’ she explains. ‘He lunged for me. I tried to get him off me, but he was so determined. ‘He raped me quite violently. I thought I was going to die that day.’ The documentary explores the controversial Restorative Justice  system, which invites victims and their attackers to meet, believing this communication can serve as a vital part of rehabilitation for the attacker. Presented by ex-Eastenders actress Brooke Kinsella, whose brother Ben was stabbed to death six years ago, the programme looks at various cases where the victim has agreed to meet their attacker.

In 2009, Jo Nodding was told by victim liason officer that the boy, now 17, was doing ‘victim empathy work'. ‘I thought, “How can that be possible? How can they know what a victim feels?”’ she says. ‘But I knew I was strong enough and brave enough to go into that meeting.’ The boy had eight months of meetings with Restorative Justice officers before he met with Ms Nodding. Brooke with an ex-offender, Peter, whom she interviews on the BBC3 documentary, on TV tonight . ‘He looked like a scared little boy,’ she says in the programme, on BBC3 tonight. ‘It was complete role reversal. He was in control of me the day of the rape and I was petrified of him. Now, he was petrified of me.’ Remarkably, the first thing Ms Nodding said was, ‘thank you for coming to this meeting.’ She described how, when he was raping her, that she saw her family flash before my eyes, such was her conviction that he would strangle her to death. At this point the boy wept, realising the true impact he had had on Ms Nodding's life. ‘I told him something that not many people will understand,' she continues. 'I told him that I forgive him, and if he hadn’t already forgiven himself, I wanted him to forgive himself because I wanted him to go on and have a successful life. Ms Noddings went on to explain how, at that moment, she finally felt strong. 'I felt on top of the world,' she says. ‘I hadn’t been myself for five years. I had my life back again.’ Can Criminals Say Sorry? is on BBC3, tonight, 9pm .","Jo Nodding, 43, met her former pupil five years after he brutally raped her .

"By . Tara Brady . James Gibbon, 62, paid for private schools for his children and a BMW for his wife . The former head of finance at Benenden Healthcare has been jailed for six years for stealing more than £1.2m to fund a lavish lifestyle of holidays and extravagant spending. James Gibbon, 62, paid for private schools for his children, a BMW for his wife, bespoke holidays, property investment and £667,000 spending on credit cards. A court heard he started work at the mutual society just six months after being released from a four-year sentence for a similar £300,000 fraud at a road construction company. His employer, Benenden Healthcare, said it shared its members’ anger that such a criminal act and significant breach of trust and responsibility had been perpetrated on the mutual, not-for-profit organisation. Andrew Haslam, prosecuting, said Gibbon had been declared bankrupt so none of the money could be reclaimed. Recorder Simon Myerson QC told Gibbon: 'It is difficult to imagine a graver breach of trust. It is not a victimless crime. 'The money belonged to the society’s 900,000 members, who had banded together to afford what they could not afford individually. 'You took their money for yourself because you wanted to and you could. It is contemptible behaviour.' Gibbon, of York, pleaded guilty to stealing £1,207,417 from Benenden Healthcare Society between January 1, 2003, and April 4, 2012. Mr Haslam told York Crown Court that Gibbon earned between £48,000 and £55,000 a year as head of finance or acting finance director from March 1998 to April 2012. He had control over the society’s corporate account and used it to make payments and cheques for his own purposes. He also falsified the society’s accounts to hide his crimes, and had control over internal audits. He was sacked in 2012 for making unauthorised payments to two women members of staff. An internal audit after his departure revealed his crimes dated back to 2006, which was as far as the society’s records went. The court heard Gibbon started work at the firm just six months after being released from a four-year jail sentence . Defending, Glenn Parsons, said Gibbon had intended to go straight on his release from prison in September 1997. He said he had worked ‘legitimately and properly’ for years but succumbed to his weakness and took advantage of a culture that was at times lax. A Benenden spokesman said Gibbon had failed to follow the values which the organisation worked to. Mr Haslam told York Crown Court (pictured) that Gibbon earned between £48,000 and £55,000 a year as head of finance . It said that while the theft had not significantly impacted the society’s financial stability, it had an effect on its members because its assets had been depleted. A spokesman said: 'We have undertaken a number of steps to reduce the risk of any future fraud on the society. These measures include reviewing and enhancing our internal control environment.' He declined to say whether Benenden had been aware of Gibbon’s previous conviction when it employed him.","James Gibbon, 62, from York paid for private schools for his children .

"By . Hugo Gye . and Alex Brummer . George Osborne today hinted at the possibility of future tax cuts as he published a report claiming that cancelling planned rises in fuel duty has boosted the economy by up to £7.5billion. The analysis could imply that the Chancellor intends to cut taxes in the next Parliament if the Conservatives manage to win a majority in the 2015 election. The Treasury study released today estimates that the effective 20 per cent real cut in fuel duty since 2010 will add 0.3 to 0.5 per cent to growth over the long term. Hint: George Osborne could use a Conservative majority to cut taxes . The study, using a model by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, supports the view of supply side economists who argue that over time lower taxes will produce higher revenue for the Exchequer. Some Tory backbenchers have been angry at the Coalition's reluctance to cut taxes since coming to power, thanks to the need to reduce the deficit. Increasing numbers of workers have been dragged in to the 40p tax band, leading to accusations that the Government has turned its back on its traditional middle-class supporters. Mr Osborne has come under pressure to cut income tax, but has so far resisted calls for 'unfunded' cuts. However, the timing of the new report is expected to point to a looser fiscal policy in a future Conservative Government. Growth: Fuel duty cuts have produced an increase in GDP by between 0.3 and 0.5 per cent . A Treasury official said: 'Fuel duty cuts have produced an increase in GDP by between 0.3 and 0.5 per cent (£4.5bn to £7.5bn in today's prices). 'This equates to an average share per household of between £175 and £300 and increased investment by around 2 per cent,' a Treasury official said. Since the Chancellor arrived at the Treasury, fuel duty has been cut by 13 per cent when inflation is taken into account. Without the policy changes, it would have jumped by 7 per cent. The result has been a 20 per cent benefit for consumers or industry. Oil prices have long been seen as a hidden tax on business and the consumer that can have a deleterious impact on economic expansion. According to the study, fuel duty that hits both businesses and households hard is ‘one of the most distortive taxes.’ The costs are particularly pronounced on business because an initial tax rise in 2010 was set too high. Successive governments have used fuel duties as a ‘sin tax’ designed to keep vehicles off the road and fulfil the agenda of green activists. The first fuel duty cut in 2010 had the greatest impact on national output and the impact became less with subsequent reductions. The Chancellor believes that his tax cut agenda that has seen corporation tax reduced to 21 per cent and the highest rate of income tax brought down from 50 per cent to 45 per cent is making a significant contribution to the UK’s recovery, the most robust among advanced countries. In his most recent budget Osborne extended and doubled the investment allowances for smaller businesses in an effort to encourage the fixed and business investment necessary to support output.","Fuel duty has been cut 20 per cent in real terms since May 2010 .

The current fire station on St Mark’s Road, half a mile from the castle, is being replaced by one two-and-a-half miles away, on the western edge of the town. Henry Swailes, development surveyor at Kemp and Kemp estate agents who is handling the sale, says: ‘It’s going to be a very popular site, in a central residential location less than a mile from both the town’s rail stations. The Windsor Castle fire in November 1992.

'A price hasn’t been set but we would expect it to be at least £4.5 million. Unconditional bids’ are being sought from interested parties.’ Royal Berkshire Fire Service stands to make more than £4m as the new station will cost £400,000 to build and the land is being given by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. The Queen is understood to have sent letters of support to a campaign against the sale of the fire station . Initially, there were plans to remove the town’s fire station entirely or reduce cover to 12 hours each day due to budget cuts. But Royal Berkshire Fire Service backed down after an outcry from celebrities including Sir Michael Parkinson, Sir Elton John and golfer Nick Faldo and legal action by the local council. Campaigners had the apparent backing of the Royal Family despite its usual refusal to get involved in political controversy. The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and Duke of York sent letters of support. The fire service says the location of the new station, which will have one engine and be staffed 24 hours, ‘will not affect attendance times’ to the castle, which suffered £40 million of damage in 1992 after a devastating blaze. ‘We have a target time of 10 minutes for the first pump to attend a fire and 12 minutes for a second. 'The new location would still allow us to meet the target,’ a spokeswoman says. Mr Swailes says the land could be redeveloped for up to 12 houses or 20 flats.","Windsor's fire station to be sold and turned into luxurious housing .

Mr Berlyne said: 'He described Mr Iqbal as ""blasting past him"" and driving at excessive speed. He described him as wobbling along all over the place and looked unsteady. 'A short distance ahead travelling in the same direction was Nicola Ferney who observed the black cab travelling in the opposite direction. 'She heard a loud revving noise and saw that Mr Iqbal had overtaken her on her nearside. In her words it was quite fast and then the driver was in collision with the rear near side of the taxi, it started to spin around rapidly. 'Gary Booth was a pedestrian, the taxi collided with him and trapped him against a set of steel railings.' He said Mr Booth suffered a fractured tibia, fibula, femur and deep wound to his calf and had to have a skin graft to his thigh. one month after the accident he was still unable to walk unaided. He had been a healthy fit young man. In his victim impact statement he said: 'Owing to all the injuries I sustained I had to change the type of vehicle I drive. I lost my job prior to Christmas owing to the injuries as I was unable to carry out the role. I had been a skiing instructor in Switzerland and was hoping to go back into this, it is very unlikely after this.' Simon Gurney, in mitigation for Iqbal said: 'The defendant is fortunate that it was not more serious. He accepts full responsibility for his conduct that night for his standard of driving and accepts that it was dangerous. It is accepted that it passes the custodial threshold. Anger: Wei says not seeing her son born has robbed him of a good start to life and says they have struggled to bond . Upset: The couple told Manchester Crown Court how their lives have suffered after Iqbal's crime . 'He is 21, of good character coupled with the previously clean driving licence. He maintains he had not seen the taxi. He was driving a vehicle with too much power. 'He was driving far too quickly and in a manner that was inappropriate. The defendant doesn't seek to blame any other party for what took place that night.' Passing sentence Recorder Neville Biddell said: 'You have caused a significant number of people very, very serious injuries, but arguably, the level of your dangerous driving is not of the most dangerous level. 'At about 10:30pm you were driving your friend home having been out for the evening. 'You clearly didn't have the experience to drive it properly, it may have been that you were showing off. 'Ahead of you was Miss Fernley she was able to see the taxi coming towards her, you missed all that and were concentrating on getting back on the inside so you could basically undertake Miss Fernley, whizzing past her. 'You were clearly driving dangerously and 50 mph was a dangerously excessive speed. 'You were cutting in and out of traffic not allowing yourself to see other traffic on the road. 'You drove into the taxi, I have seen the video and photos it is the consequences of what you did, the causing of serious injury. 'Mrs Liu she was pregnant within one month of delivery. Happy couple: The pair show a scan of unborn baby Lucas a few months before the accident . 'She sustained extremely serious injuries to her head, neck face and throat to the extent that she was unconscious. 'That had a devastating effect to her, she had to go to MRI to have an emergency Caesarean. 'Fortunately the baby was delivered. Her husband was in the taxi as well and sustained serious injuries and a friend sustained bruising.'","Zain Iqbal, 21, jailed for 28 months after smashing into taxi at 47mph .

"By . Joel Christie . Two boys were trapped in a cave without food or water for three days by themselves after becoming separated from their father in a dangerous and remote Utah canyon. Jason Knight, 35, has spoken about how his brave sons - aged 11 and eight - managed to survive with just each other and one granola bar during the harrowing ordeal. The family, from Payson, had traveled to Hanksville last Tuesday for a camping and canyoneering trip. On Wednesday they set out to explore Leprechaun Canyon, which Knight - an experienced hiker - had researched and determined was child-friendly. Survivalists: Jason Knight described his two sons - aged eight and 11 - as adventurous and outdoorsy. The pair managed to survive three nights alone in a Utah canyon without food, water or shelter . Ordeal: Jason Knight explains how he came to separated from his children for three days after they all entered the wrong canyon on an adventure trip in Utah . The family are regular hikers and canyoneerers and had not set out unprepared, Jason Knight said . Treacherous: The three unwittingly entered the Sandthrax Canyon instead of the child-friendly and amateur Leprechaun Canyon system . He said his boys are adventurous and outdoorsy and they often go on such trips together. The canyon climb was estimated to take three to five hours and the three had packed five Power bars, a few granola bars, some candy and a gallon of water. However a wrong turn resulted in them entering Sandthrax Canyon, an intense and complex series of tunnels considered dangerous for advanced climbers. According to Fox13, people have been killed in Sandthrax Canyon. However, having repelled their way down, pulling the ropes with them, once Knight realized they were not in Leprechaun it was too late - there was no way to go back up the way they came. Knight decided to continue going down the steep canyon by himself and then hike out and then back up. He would then be able to re-enter with ropes and allow his boys to climb out. But when Knight got to the bottom there was no way out, and he was trapped hundreds of feet away from his sons, who were sitting waiting for him in a small cave. Cuts and grazes can be seen on the arms of Jason Knight, sustained from when he tried to climb out of the canyon he became trapped in . Jason Knight and his two sons were rescued after they had been missing in Sandthrax Canyon for at least three days . Knight accrued minor grazes and bruises from the ordeal . Off course: Instead of exploring the Leprechaun Canyon, the Knight family accidentally entered the dangerous Sandthrax, where people have died . 'My boys did the right,' he told Fox 13. 'They stayed where they were supposed to and layed down in the cave and they slept alot. 'They knew how to survive . 'I have tried to teach them how to survive in the wilderness in case this happens.' The boys, not knowing they would be there for three, drank all their water and at their Power bars on Wednesday, leaving them one granola bar. Luckily, on Friday a woman called Wayne County authorities to say she had seen a man and two boys enter the canyon with a day pack, and that after two nights they had still not returned to their camp. Crews first located the overdue partyâ€™s car, and Saturday just before noon a Department of Public Safety helicopter found the two boys on a ledge at the top of the canyon. Regular climbers, the boys stayed where they were, slept and rationed a granola bar to survive . The three set out on Wednesday and were finally rescued on Saturday afternoon . Knight was then found about 350 feet down the bottom of the canyon. The boys were extracted at about 1:45 p.m. Saturday and the father by about 4:26 p.m. Despite dehydration, none of them were injured. Knight said the ordeal will not deter them from future adventure trips and that he will continue to canyoneer with his sons.

"By . Amanda Williams . Ashley Williams, 49, hit Julie Beattie, 24, over the head with a hammer before he doused her in a mixture of petrol and diesel fuel . A jealous father-of-twelve who burned his 24-year-old lover to death when she tried to leave him for his 18-year-old son has been jailed for life. Ashley Williams, 49, hit Julie Beattie, 24, over the head with a hammer before he doused her in a mixture of petrol and diesel fuel. She managed to stagger out of her home in flames like a ‘zombie' and gasp: ‘Ashley did this to me', before collapsing. She later died of horrific injuries, a trial at the Old Bailey heard. Two children aged four and five witnessed the murder and became the youngest witnesses to give evidence at a murder trial. Her sister Lucie Beattie described arriving at their south London home to see Williams put on his coat and walk out as Ms Beattie burned, screaming, behind him. He carried out the attack in revenge because the mother of his four children was packing her bags to live with his son Ashley jnr from a previous marriage. He claimed that he had thought he was involved in a 'water fight' and that she had been throwing the fuel at him  - but he had no idea how she actually became ignited. But he was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey by a jury of six men and six women. He showed no emotion as the verdict was announced while the victim’s family wept and clutched each other’s hands. He was jailed for life and told he must serve minimum of 25 years before being considered for release. In a statement read to the court Julie’s mother Linda Beattie said she has been ‘completely destroyed’ by his ‘incomprehensible wickedness’. Ms Beattie described her daughter as ‘beautiful, bubbly, caring and engaging’ and she said her death has devastated the family. She said the victim was a ‘large ball of positive energy, cheeky and mischievous at times and selfless’. Affair: The court heard Miss Beattie had been seeing her partner's son, Ashley Williams Jnr (pictured), 18 . ‘It’s like a horrible nightmare coping with this utterly incomprehensible wickedness,’ she added. Williams was married to Monica Williams and the couple had eight children together before they divorced in 1999. He then started a relationship with Linda Beattie, the victim’s mother, before he moved on to Julie. Ms Beattie was aged only 16 when she gave birth to their first child in 2009. The court heard that Williams became increasingly possessive and would not let his partner have a tattoo or wear revealing clothes. Ashley Jnr, 18, moved into the flat in Walworth, in September 2012 and began a sexual relationship with his father's girlfriend four or five months later, it was said . Julie Beattie, 24, was on fire when her sister Lucie arrived at the south London home, the Old Bailey heard. Julie's 49-year-old lover Ashley Williams allegedly doused her in petrol and set her alight . When Williams found out, he banned his son from having anything to do with Ms Beattie and tried to exile him from London. He threatened to ‘break every bone in his body’ if he refused to leave town. On July 18 Ms Beattie and Ashley Jnr travelled to Birmingham together. The couple had come back to London on the day of her murder, the same day Williams had sent a number of texts, begging Ms Beattie for forgiveness. In one message he said: ‘I tried over and over with you Julie. ‘I wish you nothing but the best... I’ll always love you, I just showed it too late, please forgive me Julie.’ He also sent his children bizarre messages blaming them for the break up of the relationship. In one he stated: ‘When my life is done..mark these words of your father, my curse will begin.' When Williams came home from work at 11am he locked her inside the house. Her sister Lucie Beattie collapsed in court as she relived the moment she saw her sister emerge from the house in flames. She said when she went to the house Ms Beattie screamed: ‘He’s going to kill us.’ When she returned minutes later she saw smoke billowing out of a window and ran in screaming: ‘Where’s Julie.’ She sobbed as she told the court: ‘I pushed open the kitchen door and a lot of smoke came out. ‘I saw Julie. She was in flames,’ she wept. The victim walked out of the house and rolled onto the floor before sitting down with her hands and legs out in front of her. Witnesses said that her clothing and some of her skin was actually on fire. Neighbours poured water on the victim and wrapped her in wet blankets while they waited for emergency services. Williams was arrested in a park close to the home later the same day, with self inflicted injuries. In court he claimed he was not trying to kill himself because of what had happened to the victim - but because he was upset that the fire had damaged the kitchen. Williams, of Walworth, who had denied the charge, was convicted of murder. Her sister Lucie Beattie collapsed in court as she relived the moment she saw her sister emerge from the house in flames. She said when she went to the house Ms Beattie screamed: 'He's going to kill us' Sentencing Williams, Judge Charles Ward QC said: 'I have no doubt of your controlling behaviour in the course of that rather unequal relationship. 'You killed her in the most horrific way imaginable, pouring what you knew to be a flammable liquid mixture of diesel and petrol over her front and back and then you set fire to it, set fire to her, in the house in the kitchen. 'You did so where a number of children could see, but also other adults including adults related to her - her sister.' The court heard he did nothing to try and save Miss Beattie. Judge Ward continued: 'This was a terrible terrible crime. 'I take into account your age and the fact you have not been convicted of any serious offence before. 'The sentence is life imprisonment. You will never be released until it's decided by the parole board that it's safe to release you. 'It's been concerning to watch you in this trial and your demeanor, largely impassive sometimes smiling and chuckling inappropriately. 'You are a very dangerous man. You will serve 25 years minimum.'","Julie Beattie, 24, hit over head with hammer by father-of-12 Ashley Williams .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A three-year-old who was given an egg as an Easter present was not allowed to have his name on the chocolate - because he shares his name with footballer Wayne Rooney. Rooney Scholes, from Manchester, was told that having just Rooney on the egg would cause 'copyright issues'. Yet UK law states that a person's name can not be subject to copyright. Scroll down for video . Rooney Scholes, three, from Manchester was not allowed to have his name written on the egg because of 'copyright issues. His mother Jo-Anne (R) called the shop's behaviour 'barmy' His mother, Jo-Anne Scholes, said that staff at Thorntons in Bury town centre, near Manchester, would not inscribe Rooney's name on the egg because they were concerned they would be breaching copyright. But staff agreed that the little boy could have his full name, Rooney Scholes, on the chocolate. Mrs Scholes said: 'It's madness because why have they agreed to put his full name on it? Rooney is named after Manchester United player Wayne Rooney (L). The surname of the family is coincidentally the same as retired player Paul Scholes (R) who spent his career at Manchester United . 'Surely if they can't do one then they can't do both, it's beyond belief' Mrs Scholes is a huge Manchester United fan and also has a tattoo of former player Eric Cantona on her arm. She also has two cats called Cantona and Berbatov, named after Bulgarian player Dimitar Berbatov who left United in 2012. She said that she did not think Wayne Rooney 'would be bothered in the slightest' because he has children of his own . 'What should have been a nice surprise for Easter has turned into a total farce,' she added. Mother Jo-Anne Scholes was outraged when the shop in Bury, Manchester refused to write just her son's first name on the egg . Mrs Scholes branded the shop's behaviour 'barmy'. The mother-of-four from Rochdale said: 'It’s just pathetic that they wouldn’t let a childhave his name on an Easter egg for fear of upsetting Wayne Rooney. 'It’s just nonsense anyway. Rooney is his name, does that mean he’s not allowed to have his name on anything because he shares it with a famous footballer?' She said that she had been upset by the fact that Rooney could not just have his first name on the egg because it made the present 'impersonal. She said having his full name on the chocolate looking 'a bit silly really'. 'My neighbour Janet actually bought the egg for Rooney as a treat but the staff told her point blank that they wouldn't put his first name on it because of copyright,' Mrs Scholes said. Mrs Scholes other son is called Anderson but the choice preceded the arrival of Brazilian footballer Anderson who has now left the club. She said that she called her youngest child Rooney as a tribute to the man who has been her favourite player 'for years' 'just because of his style of play and the way he carries the team'. 'I had a couple of nervy moments when it looked like Wayne might be off to Chelsea in the summer but thankfully he stayed where he belongs,' she added. A spokesman for Thorntons . said: 'Thorntons apologises for the service provided to Ms. Scholes at . the weekend. 'The Company does abide by copyright laws but these were not . applicable in this case. 'Our free Personalising Easter eggs service is . something that our customers enjoy and are usually delighted with and we . are very sorry that this was not the case in this instance.' A spokesman for Wayne Rooney declined to comment. Staff at the store refused to comment on the incident. According to England & Wales Baby Names, in 2002, the same year Rooney burst onto the scene at Everton, three babies in Britain were named Rooney. The following year, 2003, seven babies were given the name. In 2004, the year he joined Manchester United, the number of babies given the name was eight, bringing the total over three years to 18. The name flopped in 2007 when no parents imitated the footballer - perhaps reflecting England's poor showing at the 2006 World Cup - but in 2008 was resurrected again when three babies used the name. For three years 2009-2011, no parents picked Rooney as a name for their newborn before five babies called Rooney were brought into the world in 2012. Since 1999, 42 babies have been named Rooney, according to records. The last recorded data from 2012 showed that the most popular boy's name was Harry.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Offenders ordered to do unpaid work rather than go to prison see it as an easy option, and many don't even bother to turn up for all of it, new research shows. A Ministry of Justice report found that 82 per cent of offenders saw community service orders, which covered menials tasks such as clearing local parks, cleaning graffiti, or cleaning the streets, as less harsh than going to prison. Despite this, nearly three-quarters (70 per cent) of those given unpaid work missed at least a day of it, and 14 per cent said they had missed most of it. Soft option: Most offenders given community orders say they are easier than going to prison (file image) And their failure to attend largely went unpenalised: court action was taken in less than half the number of cases of those who failed to attend their unpaid work. And only 21 per cent of offenders questioned for the Ministry of Justice survey, which questioned offenders over 18 who were given community orders, said the fear of getting another community order would stop them reoffending in future. The research found that 77 per cent of offenders who had been to prison before thought that prison would have been a worse punishment than a community order, while 87 per cent of offenders who had not been to prison felt that way. Today, a think-tank said community punishments should be harsher to ensure they did deter would-be criminals and change behaviour. Max Chambers from the Policy Exchange said: 'Unpaid work requirements must be far more demanding and intensive if they are to deter criminals and command public confidence. 'We need a competent probation system that actually changes behaviour. 'The best way to do that is to reform the system so that there is a rigorous focus on compliance and a serious effort to punish infractions in a rapid and consistent way.' More than 70 per cent of those told to do unpaid work admit to having missed at least a day of it (file image) But Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said community sentences were being 'toughened up'. He said: 'Hard-working taxpayers expect those convicted of committing crime to be punished accordingly. 'Victims must be confident that offenders will pay a price for their crimes, which is why we have toughened up community sentences to now include a punitive element in all adult community sentences. 'Since 2010 criminals are also more likely to go to prison, and for longer. 'Step by step we're overhauling sentencing and sending a clear message to criminals - if you break the law, you will be punished.'","Vast majority of criminals see community sentences as easier than prison .

"By . Mark Duell . An amateur footballer who suffered shocking facial injuries when he was beaten by thugs has achieved his dream of becoming a model. Richie Robins, 21, courageously intervened when he saw the woman - who he did not know - cornered by six thugs outside a nightclub. The sport development student was punched to the ground and his attackers continued the assault in Colchester, Essex, while he lay bleeding. Debut: Richie Robins (right) at a fashion show in Mayfair, central London, after reconstructive surgery . Mr Robins was left with horrific facial injuries including a broken nose, cheek and eye socket after the attack last December. He had been approached by a modelling agency a week before the assault and feared his dreams of a career on the catwalk were over. But thanks to facial reconstructive surgery on the NHS, his smile and looks have been restored. And two weeks ago the student made his catwalk debut at a show in Mayfair, London. Mr Robins - a 6ft 2in goalkeeper for non-league team Wivenhoe Town FC - still suffers nightmares from the attack, and said the modelling has been a ‘massive confidence boost’.

I had written modelling off so it was a massive . confidence boost to walk down the catwalk.’ Mr Robins was set upon outside a nightclub in Colchester on December 21 after going to support his friend’s new event. He spent Christmas in hospital - eating his roast dinner through a straw – and then a further four months in and out of hospital. Surgeons at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford fixed his broken nose and spent two hours carefully inserting a metal plate into his left cheek. Mr Robins, who still has swelling on his left side, was stunned when he was scouted for the catwalk and told the scars on his nose and forehead wouldn’t hold him back. Michelle Court, founder of creative agency Court On Camera who headhunted him, said: ‘When I saw him I just thought he has amazing cheekbones. Following his dream: Mr Robins pictured on the catwalk following reconstructive surgery .

Mr Robins was a goalkeeper for Wivenhoe Town, who play in the Thurlow Nunn Eastern Counties Football League Premier Division - five divisions below the professional Football League. He has played 12 times this season for the side - winning twice, drawing once and losing nine times - although his last appearance was on December 14, seven days before the attack. Mr Robins was also a youth player with Colchester United, and was offered the chance to train with Premier League West Ham United. Essex Police are still investigating the attack which took place outside a Subway store, and two men are on bail until May 8.

Stephen Sutton was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2010 when he was 15. But despite having the tumour removed from his bowel it returned the next year, and doctors told him he would be unlikely to survive more than a few years. Stephen Sutton, a teenager with terminal cancer in a race against time to complete his 'bucket list' and raise £1 million for charity . Stephen (pictured with comedian Jimmy Carr), 19,  has been battling cancer since the age of 15. Within six months he underwent a hemicolectomy to remove a tumour from his bowel . Stephen organised a World Record Attempt for the World's longest continuous group drum roll . Last January the fun loving teenager drew up his bucket list of 46 tasks to complete before he dies. He has already ticked off 35 of the 46 tasks and he is desperately trying to finish number one on the list  - of raising £1million for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Stephen, from Burntwood, Staffordshire, has already raised £572,000 after cataloguing his progress on Facebook. Among the activities he has achieved include 'hugging an animal bigger than himself' when he embraced an elephant at West Midlands Safari Park, and appearing as an extra in the BBC daytime drama Doctors after he wrote to the producers. He has also played the drums in front of 90,000 people at last year’s Bayern Munich v Borussia Dortmund Champions League final at Wembley. He has also met Jimmy Carr, crowd-surfed in a rubber dinghy, ridden a Segway, delivered a speech about cancer at Number 10 Downing Street, gone on a lads’ holiday and been busking.

He said: 'I started the list because I wanted to try and raise as much money as I could for Teenage Cancer Trust' Stephen Sutton gave a speech at Downing Street July 17 2013 . Bowel cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is the third most common cancer in the UK, and also one of the most preventable forms of the disease, World Cancer Research Fund says. in 2011, 42,747 cases of bowel cancer were diagnosed. Scientists estimate that about half of all bowel cancer cases in the UK - over 20,000 - could be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, choosing a healthy diet, not drinking alcohol and being physically active. Many different factors contribute to the development of bowel cancer, with some of the most important factors being every day lifestyle choices such as diet. World Cancer Research Fund, a charity which gives advice on how cancer can be prevented through diet, physical activity and weight, found that lifestyle factors that can increase the risk of developing bowel cancer include being: overweight or obese, lack of physical activity, diets low in fibre, diets high in red and processed meat, drinking alcohol, smoking. Other factors include age, family history of bowel cancer, or personal history of polyps or inflammatory bowel disease. For more information about how to reduce the risk of developing bowel cancer, visit WCRF’s advice page on colorectal cancer. 'The one that got me going and was a real thrill was playing the drums at Wembley. 'It was during the opening ceremony of the Champions League Final and the noise was amazing, walking onto the pitch, being a part of that is something I will never forget. 'My family and friends are fully behind me and really supportive which is great. 'My cancer obviously changed me and I realised that I would regret the things I didn’t do, I don’t want to take anything for granted and I don’t plan to. 'I have just finished another round of chemotherapy and I am currently on lots of medication, but I am used to that. 'I like to think I have motivated people to fund raise and do what I have done, if I can do it, anyone can, I know that my positivity is rubbing off on people and that feels brilliant. 'I really hope I can complete my bucket list and that is what I plan to do, but first and foremost, I want to raise as much money as possible and get to a million, it will help others, save others and change people’s lives.' To complete his bucket list, Stephen needs to tick off 11 more activities. His next ambition on the list is to make it into the Guinness Book of Records by taking part in the biggest ever tandem skydive with over 251 people.

"By . Associated Press . The dead bodies of seven babies that were found hidden in a Utah garage have been sent to the state's medical examiner's office for DNA testing and to determine their cause of death. Megan Huntsman, 39, is accused of killing her babies after giving birth to the children between 1996 and 2006, investigators said. She was booked Sunday into the Utah County Jail with six counts of murder. It wasn't immediately clear if Huntsman has an attorney or why there were six counts and not seven. The bodies were found by her estranged husband Darren West, who has been in prison on drug-related charges prior to making the grisly discovery. Serial . killer?: Megan Huntsman is accused of killing seven of her own newborns . and stuffing their bodies into boxes in the garage . Roberts said police believe West and Huntsman were together when the babies were born. DNA samples taken from the suspect and her husband will determine definitively whether the two are the parents, as investigators believe. Huntsman also has three daughters — one teenager and two young adults — who lived at the house. Late Sunday, West's family issued a statement saying they were in a 'state of shock and confusion.' 'We are mourning this tragic loss of life and we are trying to stay strong and help each other through this awful event,' the statement said before asking for privacy. West pleaded guilty in federal court in 2005 to two counts of possessing chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine, court records show. In August 2006, he was sentenced to nine years in prison, but appealed the term three times. He maintained his innocence and said he never had any intention to manufacture meth. It is unclear when he was released. On . the scene: Authorities investigate a crime scene where they say seven . dead infants were found in the former home of Megan Huntsman . What she did: Huntsman has been charged with six counts of murder, but it is unclear why she has not been charged with seven since that many bodies were found . West's sister Sarah Wright wrote to federal district court in 2006, saying West is a good father to his three daughters. 'Darren is such an awesome dad,' she wrote. The gruesome case has raised a series of questions about how the killings occurred despite Huntsman carrying out what neighbors seemed like a normal existence. Police declined to comment on a motive and what Huntsman said during an interview with investigators. Police Capt. Michael Roberts said officers responded to a call from West on Saturday about a dead infant, and then they found the six other bodies. Family and neighbors identified the estranged husband as Darren West, who has been in prison on drug-related charges. Roberts said police believe West and Huntsman were together when the babies were born. 'We don't believe he had any knowledge of the situation,' Roberts told The Associated Press . Asked how the man could not have known about the situation, Roberts replied, . 'That's the million-dollar question. Amazing.' Huntsman moved out several years ago, leaving her three daughters, one teenager and two young adults, to live alone, their neighbors the Hawkers said. They weren't sure where Huntsman has since been living. Littered: Things were strewn about the yard Sunday afternoon after police took all the evidence they needed . Where it happened: The home Huntsman shared with her ex-husband until 2011, where seven dead babies were found this weekend . Roped off: Crime scene tape could be seen around the property Sunday as authorities dug for more evidence . Years ago, Huntsman baby-sat the Hawker grandchildren and they were friendly with each other. 'It makes us so sad, we want to cry,' Kathie Hawker said. 'We enjoyed having them as a neighbor. This has just blown us away.' Aaron Hawker said he talked with West on Saturday morning. He told Hawker he was cleaning out the mess in the garage. 'Two hours later, suddenly we had all these policemen here,' Aaron Hawker said. Fred Newman, a neighbor whose cousin is the husband's mother, said he's perplexed how the three oldest daughters living there didn't know about what police say was going on. He said the girls didn't always park their cars in the garage, but did sometimes in the cold winter months. 'What's shocking is the three older ones living there and not noticing that their mother was pregnant,' Newman said. He said he has used his snow-blower to clean off the driveway of the home and the young women would thank him. The girls were normal youngsters, coming and going often, neighbor Vickie Nelson said. 'It's shocking and kind of morbid and strange,' Nelson said as he looked across the street at the garage from her from lawn.

"By . Mark Duell . and Rob Davies . Traffic wardens gave out one ticket every four seconds last year, earning £255million for councils. Some 7.8million penalty charge notices were left on windscreens in 2013, according to information obtained under Freedom of Information laws. Experts warn the number of fines is likely to rise even higher unless councils refrain from hitting drivers with ‘opportunistic’ penalties. And the figures could be underestimated as only 187 of 435 UK councils responded to the Freedom of Information request by Churchill Car Insurance – meaning some may be hiding that they are among the top earners. Traffic warden: A study has found the average number of Penalty Charge Notices issued per council last year was more than 23,000, while one in 15 parking fines were successfully challenged (file picture) The data showed the average number . of Penalty Charge Notices issued per council was more than 23,000, . while one in 15 parking fines were successfully challenged. The research by the company also found Westminster City Council issued the equivalent of more than four PCNs per resident last year - 455,000 in total, worth £24million. Outside of the capital, Cardiff Council issued the highest number of parking fines at 57,000 and North Somerset Council generated the most revenue at £2.25million. In addition, the number of tickets issued by councils fell by only 1.5 per cent between 2012 and 2013 - despite pleas from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles for them to sharply cut down this figure. In some councils the figures actually rose - with St Edmundsbury Borough Council in Suffolk hitting motorists with 9,442 tickets last year, compared to 1,652 in 2012 - a rise of 472 per cent. Meanwhile, there were also increases . seen at Runnymede Borough Council in Surrey and Kingston Council in . south-west London of 55 and 29 per cent respectively, reported The . Sunday Times. Mr Pickles, 61, . said last year: ‘Local authorities should not use parking as a tax or . cash cow, and we are currently looking into the potentially illegal use . of councils’ parking contracts.’ Appeal: The number of tickets issued by councils fell by only 1.5 per cent between 2012 and 2013 - despite pleas from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (pictured) for them to sharply cut down this figure . While councils keep the cash raised from penalty notices, it must be spent on transport-related work. Most car parking penalties are £40 or £60, with ‘on the road’ offences coming in at £50 or £70. Steve Barrett, head of car insurance at Churchill, said: ‘Parking regulations are a hugely important part of keeping roads safe and clear, but it’s also essential that fines are fair and proportionate. 'There is a fine line between fair and opportunistic that councils shouldn’t be tempted to cross' Steve Barrett, Churchill . ‘In many areas, parking restrictions can be confusing and appear inconsistent, so we’d urge motorists to be vigilant when parking their vehicles to avoid hefty fines. ‘The capital is extremely congested so we’d expect to see a higher number of restrictions in place and penalties being issued. However, there is a fine line between fair and opportunistic that councils shouldn’t be tempted to cross.’ Some 187 of the 435 councils contacted by Churchill, which is part of the Direct Line group, replied to the Freedom of Information requests they were sent. The following data shows 2013 figures for councils which responded to Churchill's requests: .","Average number of PCNs issued per council more than 23,000 in 2013 .

"By . Hugo Gye . Anger: Nigel Evans has called for the Crown Prosecution Service to repay his legal expenses . MPs today called for an investigation into high-profile prosecutions of celebrities in the wake of the acquittal of Nigel Evans, the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. Keith Vaz asked the regulator of the Crown Prosecution Service to probe whether there was really enough evidence to charge Mr Evans and other well-known figures who have been on trial recently. Coronation Street stars Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell were both cleared of sexual assault charges after long-running trials, leading to accusations that the CPS is over-zealous in prosecuting famous people. Mr Evans, the MP for Ribble Valley, today vowed to use his position to fight for others caught up in the legal system and then acquitted. He has asked Mr Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, to consider whether defendants should be given more protection before and during trials. The select committee boss has written to Michael Fuller, the CPS's chief inspector, urging him to examine whether the prosecutor's procedures are 'sufficiently robust'. Mr Vaz asked Mr Fuller asked him to look into whether the CPS had followed due process in deciding whether to bring prosecutions, whether there was sufficient evidence to bring charges, and whether the procedures in such cases needed to be amended. 'Politicians should not become involved in the operational decision-making of the CPS. It is vital, however, that the processes followed by the CPS are correct and robust,' Mr Vaz said. 'Nigel Evans has asked that the committee look at this issue and I have written to Mr Fuller to request he investigate whether we need to make changes to the system. We await his response with interest. 'The balance must be struck so that the public remains fully confident that those who are guilty will be brought to justice, but also that those who are innocent are not unnecessarily punished.' Earlier today, Mr Evans suggested that the CPS had become over-zealous in pursuing sex abuse claims after failing to charge Jimmy Savile with paedophilia. 'The balance probably went too far in one way and now it seems to have gone too far the other way - that there is almost this we-better-charge-just-in-case - and it does seem to be unfair,' he said. Scroll down for video . Walking free: The former Deputy Speaker has accused prosecutors of cobbling together a weak case . Mr Evans, 56, was charged with one count of rape, five of sexual assault, one attempted sexual assault and two indecent assaults. Last Thursday, a jury at Preston Crown Court unanimously cleared him of all the charges. He told BBC Radio 4's programme this morning that 'there were weak allegations which were bundled together to make it look as if it were a stronger case'. The MP continued: 'I've likened it to being hit by an Eddie Stobart truck as soon as you wake up, and several times during the day. The only worse thing I could have been accused of was murder. 'The people who are throwing the mud remain anonymous, yet I was put into the full glare of world publicity from day one, as soon as the police knocked on the door. This is something that needs to be looked at.' He denied claims that there is a culture of low-level sexual abuse within Parliament, saying: 'There is a narrative that has been put out there, and people are spreading this narrative, but it's completely wrong.' Claims: In the wake of the case, allegations have emerged of a culture of sexual abuse in Parliament . Mr Evans revealed that he would not seek to regain his position as Deputy Speaker, which he resigned last year after being charged with assault, and said he would focus on fighting for reforms to allow acquitted defendants to reclaim their legal costs. 'I've got a voice, and there are a lot of people who've equally gone through the mill and don't have the voice that I have,' he told Today. 'People who are wrongly accused and been put through the mill, they need proper representation. 'But at the end of it all, when they're acquitted they're told, ""You're not going to get a single penny back."" That has got to be wrong.' He told ITV's Daybreak that in light of his experiences, he opposes the cuts to legal aid made by the Coalition Government. 'I see things through the prism of having gone through sheer hell for 11 months,' Mr Evans said. 'I believe people who are dragged through the courts, who are acquitted, should get a reasonable legal cost back.' Acquitted: Coronation Street stars Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell were also cleared of assault charges . The MP suggested that the Crown Prosecution Service had become over-zealous in pursuing sex abuse claims after failing to charge Jimmy Savile with paedophilia. 'The balance probably went too far in one way and now it seems to have gone too far the other way - that there is almost this we-better-charge-just-in-case - and it does seem to be unfair,' he said. Mr Evans said he had received more than 1,000 messages of support and he was 'heartened' by Prime Minister David Cameron's remarks after the verdict, in which he hinted that the MP will be brought back into the Tory fold. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the work of the CPS, telling a Westminster press conference it was a 'linchpin' of the legal system. He said: 'I'm sure the CPS as a matter of course will always review cases, particularly where they haven't succeeded to deliver prosecutions they felt were merited. 'But I will always defend the CPS as part of the checks and balances in our judicial system. 'We wouldn't have much of a judicial system if the CPS succeeded every time. That's what justice is about - it's about people bringing prosecutions and then those allegations and those claims being examined in court and a decision being made.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Anyone who has applied for legal aid and is subsequently acquitted of a crime is entitled to be repaid at least part of their legal costs - irrespective of whether their application was accepted.'","Former Deputy Speaker claims the assault allegations against him were too weak to stand on their own .

"By . Tara Brady . A nationwide hunt is under way for five chihuahuas including a Crufts champion worth £20,000 which were stolen by thieves who smashed their way into the dogs' home. Valenchino Chihuahua Xena, who was named Best Puppy in Breed at Crufts 2014, was snatched with four other dogs from a house in East Yorkshire on Thursday. Owner Mal Hilton said he and his partner Lucy Hilton have been left devastated by the theft of Xena, her grandmother Angel and her mother Io, as well as two others called Pandora and Evie. Xena was named Best Puppy in Breed at last month's Crufts and is worth £20,000 . Xena may have been targeted for breeding because her puppies would be worth thousands of pounds . They fear the thieves will realise the dogs, worth tens of thousands of pounds, are impossible to sell and will harm them instead. 'I'm 65 years old and I haven't cried for years until now,' said Mr Hilton, a father-of-two. 'They are just like our children. We are devastated by this and we just want them back.' He described how the raiders broke into the house in the village of Lissett, near Driffield, by smashing a window with an iron bar. Xena is worth £20,000 while the others are worth £3,000 each. Expensive: Xena's mother Io is worth £3,000 and was one of five chihuahuas stolen in the raid . The grandmother of Crufts champion Xena, Angel, who was also stolen by the thieves in East Yorkshire . 'I just want someone to hand them in - to the RSPCA, to a vet, to anywhere safe. It doesn't matter. just leave them somewhere so we can get them back. 'I'm just so worried they will come to harm.' Fourteen-month old fawn longcoat Xena, whose show name is Valenchino Made of Candy, has won at many shows but her crowning glory was being named Best Puppy in Breed at Crufts last month. She has also qualified for Crufts 2015. Humberside Police confirmed that intruders entered the house between 9.30am and 4.50pm on Thursday. Mystery: Pandora, a Russian tri smooth coat, one of the chihuahuas stolen in the raid in Yorkshire . Targeted: A white long coat chihuahua called Evie which was was snatched with four other dogs . Officers said they believe the thieves might have used a wicker basket to take the dogs away. A spokesman said: 'The owner of the chihuahuas is desperate to find them. 'These dogs need to be reunited with their owner and police are appealing for anyone who knows anything to contact them immediately so that we can have a happy ending to this story.'","Xena was named Best Puppy in Breed at Crufts 2014 last month .

"By . Maureen Sugden . Plans to blow up five city tower blocks at the opening of the Commonwealth Games have been ditched with only 100 days to go after organisers were forced into an embarrassing U-turn. Games chiefs had wanted to use 2,755lbs of explosives to demolish the Glasgow Red Road flats in an event which would have been seen by a worldwide TV audience of more than a billion people. Despite outraged critics branding the  proposals ‘callous’, ‘insensitive’ and ‘crass’ – and more than 17,000 people signing a  petition calling for them to be scrapped –  organisers had insisted the show would go ahead on July 23. Controversial: Five tower blocks which have been part of Glasgow's skyline for almost 50 years were to be blown up as part of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony . Relics: Six of the original eight tower blocks remain after two earlier demolitions, one in 2012 and one last year (pictured) But in a victory for common sense yesterday – the day after the Scottish Daily Mail revealed that families living in the shadow of the flats would refuse to leave on demolition day in protest – the proposals were abandoned under health and safety fears. Change of plan: Although the blocks will still be brought down, it will not form part of the Games . The decision to drop the plans is an embarrassment for the 2014 Games organisers and First Minister Alex Salmond, who, as the Scottish Daily Mail revealed, knew of the project in February, despite claims he only learned about it on April 1. In a TV interview yesterday, Mr Salmond said the U-turn was a ‘sensible decision’ that will be ‘welcomed widely’. However, critics said he must explain how the farcical situation had arisen in the first place. There was little sign of contrition and certainly no apology from those behind the aborted plans. Five of the six remaining blocks are still scheduled to be demolished but there are no details of what will replace their demise as the highlight of the Games opening ceremony, centred at Celtic Park. Last night, critics, protesters and people who live near the high-rises welcomed the news of the U-turn. Mother-of-three Michelle Ronald, 33, whose home is in the shadow of the flats, was one of those who threatened to stay in the blast zone to scupper the plan. She said: ‘We had to act to stop the demolition happening purely for entertainment. You have to remember that it would have been blowing up people’s memories on live television. ‘It would just not have been right and that’s why we said we would not be moved. Blowing up five at once will leave us with so much dirt and dust it would be unbearable. ‘I was also very concerned that my roof and walls would be badly damaged in the blast.’ London Olympics opened with The Queen and James Bond parachuting into the Olympic Stadium -bosses of Glasgow Commonwealth Games planned their own explosive opening by blowing up five tower blocks - but have now changed their mind . Former Scottish Socialist MSP Carolyn Leckie, who began the public petition against the demolition, said she was ‘relieved and extremely pleased’ about the decision. She added: ‘I think it’s great, it’s a sensible decision. I think everybody will be relieved and I think the more than-17,000 people who expressed their views in the petition will be relieved. ‘It’s an indication that people power can be effective.’ The climbdown came in a statement released yesterday afternoon. Police Scotland made it clear that as anger grew over the plan, the stance of local people had ‘changed the safety and security context’ of the Games and revealed that they had asked organisers to reconsider the whole idea. Summer of sport: The 11 days of competition in Glasgow will begin on July 23 . David Grevemberg, Glasgow 2014 chief executive, last week publicly defended the demolition proposals. But last night he said:  ‘The decision to feature the live demolition of five Red Road blocks within the opening ceremony was planned both as commemoration of a part of Glasgow’s social history, as well as a statement of the city’s regeneration. ‘We made it clear from the outset the absolute priority was safety and that this event would only happen during the opening ceremony if it was safe to do so. ‘Over the past few days it has become clear that opinions have been expressed which change the safety and security context. ‘Glasgow 2014, Games Partners and key stakeholders, including Police Scotland and Glasgow Housing Association, are not prepared to allow what was proposed to be a positive act of commemoration to create risk for all concerned.’ In his TV interview yesterday, Mr Salmond said: ‘I think it’s a sensible decision that will be widely welcomed. There are two aspects –  one is the safety aspect which has  been cited by the organising committee. ‘And secondly there’s a wider aspect: the Games are a unifying force for Glasgow and Scotland and we want all aspects of the Games to bring Glasgow and Scotland together.’ Scottish hero: Chris Hoy helped to celebrate Glasgow's velodrome for the Commonwealth Games, but the decision to blow up the flats caused outrage locally . The First Minister added: ‘I don’t think the safety issue is “face-saving”, it’s very, very important.’ The Scottish Conservatives’ sports spokesman Liz Smith, MSP, said the climbdown was ‘a victory for common sense’. She added: ‘Let’s not forget that Scotland’s First Minister was involved in the decision-making process. Alex Salmond now has some explaining to do as to why we ever got into this farcical situation.’ Labour insiders claim the SNP has been desperate to protect Mr Salmond from the fall-out sparked by the furious reaction to the demolition plan and a Tory insider accused the Scottish Government of a ‘cover-up’.","Flats were to be blown up in 15 seconds using 2,755lbs of explosives .

"By . Daniel Martin . Tragedies like the Mid Staffs scandal could be repeated unless there is a revolution in the way the public sector deals with complaints, MPs warned last night. A Commons committee found there was a culture of denial among managers in councils, schools and the health service – meaning they take little notice of criticism. Their failure to listen is so bad that aggrieved members of the public simply believe there is no point in making complaints, MPs found. Tragedies like the Mid Staffs scandal could be repeated unless lessons are learned by the public sector . The report from the Commons public administration select committee comes a week after England’s top health watchdog warned that tens of thousands of elderly people were ‘suffering in silence’ on NHS wards because they were too polite to ‘make a fuss’. In an article for the Daily Mail, Dame Julie Mellor, the health service ombudsman, called for a ‘significant cultural shift’ in the way complaints are handled. The MPs’ report also highlighted the failures that were exposed in the damning review by Robert Francis QC on Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, where up to 1,200 died amid appalling neglect. Tens of thousands of elderly people are 'suffering in silence' on wards, according to a report. Stock image . It called on ministers to force a culture change across the public sector to prevent future tragedies. Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin said: ‘There needs to be a revolution in the way public services are run, and how the public perceives government. Bernard Jenkin: 'There needs to be a revolution in the way public services are run' ‘As things are, most people believe  there is no point in complaining.  Unless and until we have a culture of leadership in public services that listens to, values and responds to complaints  from service users and staff, there will always be the potential for tragedies like Mid Staffs.’ The committee recommended a minister for complaints should be introduced, along with a dedicated unit to deal with grievances about government agencies. Its report, More Complaints Please, found public sector managers viewed complaints as ‘hostile criticism’ rather than a chance to tackle problems. MPs called for a culture where complaints are valued and suggested the Cabinet Office work with high performing private sector companies to find the best ways of dealing with the issue. The committee also attacked the public sector for using euphemistic words such as ‘feedback’ instead of ‘complaint’, saying they give the impression that concerns are not being taken on board. Last night Dame Julie said: ‘The findings present an opportunity for organisations to deal more effectively with complaints and develop ways to learn from those mistakes. ‘Good complaint handling has to start from the top, and strong leaders will recognise the valuable opportunities complaints provide to really improve.’ Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s essential for better public services that the Government makes it easier and more effective for people  to complain. ‘Giving people a single point of contact and having a minister who is responsible should give people more confidence that complaints do count.’ Write caption here .","Lessons must be learned from Mid Staffs scandal, MPs warned .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Mia De Graaf . Missing: Mami Konneh Lahun, who finished 20th in the London Marathon, disappeared after the race yesterday but was found today . A female athlete from Sierra Leone who was declared missing then supposedly found is in fact still missing, it has emerged. Mami Konneh Lahun, 24, was reportedly discovered 'safe and well' in Greenwich 24 hours after disappearing from the finish line of the London Marathon. But five hours later, Scotland Yard has revealed she is still missing and there has been no trace of her after she finished 20th in yesterday's race. It is understood a police officer was involved in the error becoming public, although Scotland yard refused to say if that was the case. A police spokesman said: 'We were given incorrect information, she is still missing.' It is an embarrassment for Greenwich borough Commander Helen Millichap, whose officers were involved in the search. Police put out an appeal last night after Miss Lahun failed to return to her temporary accommodation in Greenwich yesterday. The athlete, who is Sierra Leone's fastest-ever 5,000 metre and 10,000 metre runner, last year won her country's marathon and in neighbouring Liberia. She is the first woman from Sierra Leone to have represented the country at the London Marathon. Scotland Yard said she arrived in Britain a week ago to prepare for the marathon, and finished in just over 2 hours 46 minutes. Detectives looking into her disappearance revealed she had no known links to the UK and no money or mobile phone. Earlier today, a Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'She has today been found safe and well, having returned to the address in Greenwich'. It came after the London Olympics in 2012, where dozens of athletes and coaches disappeared or claimed asylum after the Games. The Mail revealed that seventy claimed political asylum after the Olympics and more than have were given refugee status. Last year police admitted they were still looking for 21 people who just vanished, with one official saying that some had competed then ‘simply wandered off to make a better life’ in Britain. Those who failed to return home were from countries including the Ivory Coast, Guinea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Cameroon and Sudan. Start: Miss Lahun was part of the elite women's race, pictured here sprinting at the start on Blackheath yesterday . Inquiry: The athlete was last seen after crossing the finishing line in The Mall yesterday and failed to appear at her accommodation in Greenwich until today . Talented: Mami Konneh Lahun was part of the front pack in the elite women's race yesterday, finishing a creditable 20th in 2hrs 46mins . Among those believed to have claimed asylum were the Congolese judo coach Ibula Masengo, athletics director Guy Nkita and boxing trainer Blaise Bekwa. The Eritrean athlete Weynay Ghebresilasie, 18, was one of four from his country to claim asylum before the Games finished. He said he was doing so because of ‘harsh conditions’ and ‘lack of basic human rights’ in Eritrea. Anyone with information about the whereabouts of  Mami Konneh Lahun asked to call 101, quoting reference 14MIS012462.

Hampson also admitted failing to notify a change in her circumstances between May and June 2006 in relation to a council tax benefit claim, resulting in a loss of £48 to the London Borough of Sutton. She told the DWP that she only charged tenants £20 per week - but was renting out rooms at the property, which has a swimming pool in its 120ft back garden, for £480 to £540 per month. During the five-year scam she converted her loft with the illicit profits, adding three bedrooms to the house - on a road with an average property value of £369,000 - almost doubling her rental capacity. There has been a four-year sentencing delay due to Hampson twice unsuccessfully applying to withdraw her guilty pleas and petitioning the Social Security Tribunal to reduce her unlawful claim from an initial figure of over £45,000. She achieved local notoriety after the council published her conviction. Her lawyer David Burgess said: ‘It was picked-up by local newspapers and she has been subjected to a four-year campaign of harassment and criminal damage. Home: During the five-year scam she converted her loft with the illicit profits, adding three bedrooms to the house (pictured) - on a road with an average property value of £369,000 - almost doubling her rental capacity . ‘For her the criminal record is a very, very serious thing and her son, a professional rugby player’s signing with Bath was declined because a Google search revealed this woman’s prosecution for fraud on the London Borough of Sutton’s website.’ 'Her son, a professional rugby player’s signing with Bath was declined because a Google search revealed this woman’s prosecution for fraud on the London Borough of Sutton's website' David Burgess, defending . Following a tip-off from a disgruntled ex-tenant in 2007 Sutton Council’s fraud investigation team worked with the DWP to gather evidence and prosecute Hampson. She initially denied the fraud, but on the first day of her trial in December, 2009 she eventually admitted the two charges. Hampson did not surrender to the glass-panelled secure dock due to agoraphobia, which can instigate panic attacks. Mr Burgess added: ‘This lady has had a number of problems throughout her life, not just her physical and mental well-being, but generally surviving.’ Aerial view: She told the DWP that she only charged tenants £20 per week - but was renting out rooms at the property, which has a swimming pool in its 120ft back garden (pictured), for £480 to £540 per month . A doctor described her as someone ‘trapped in the hopelessness of her situation, which is taking a toll on her health’. The court heard she has depression, . anxiety, arthritis, early dementia and Mr Burgess said: ‘Her condition . has been aggravated by these proceedings, which has not improved her . mental state.’ 'When probation officers spoke to you, you did not do yourself any favours' Judge Daniel Flahive . Another report described her as ‘paranoid and vulnerable’, concluding: ‘People take advantage of her with her willing participation.’ Judge Daniel Flahive sentenced Hampson to 28 days' imprisonment last Friday, suspended for 12 months, telling her: ‘The sums involved came about because you did not declare properly rental income you received from lodgers. ‘When probation officers spoke to you, you did not do yourself any favours. Yesterday [Thursday] was the first time documentation was produced to the court confirming that you do have these medical conditions.’","Lynne Hampson's winger son Sam, 24, has played for London Wasps .
