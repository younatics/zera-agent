"(Health.com) -- More than 100 million people are expected to tune in to Super Bowl XLV this weekend, but only some of them are football fans. Thanks to pregame hype and Hollywood-quality production values, Super Bowl commercials have become the main attraction for many viewers. But are these blockbuster ads bad for our waistlines? Food and beverage companies are expected to account for roughly one-third of the ads that will air during Sunday's game, according to Advertising Age. (Car companies will take up another one-third or so, with the remainder split among websites, film studios, and retail chains.) Viewers and partygoers -- including millions of children -- can expect to see ads from Doritos, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Snickers, and Budweiser. Health.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat . In other words, a high proportion of ads are pitching soda, snacks, and other junk foods loaded with calories, sugar, sodium, and fat. ""Studies show [that] if you see an ad for a product and try it for the first time, you like it more than if you didn't see the ad,"" says Jennifer Harris, Ph.D., the director of marketing initiatives at Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity, in New Haven. ""It really is shaping our preferences as well as triggering us to eat more."" Yes, advertising works . Humor, suspense, and sexy people digging into supersize bags of Doritos have become a staple of Super Bowl commercials. It's the oldest trick in the book: Make a product or brand attractive and appealing by surrounding it with attractive and appealing stuff. It's tempting to believe that this strategy won't work on you. In the real world, nearly everyone recognizes that people who consume a lot of soda, junk food, and beer are often overweight and unhealthy -- not exactly what's depicted on-screen. And yet we give in to the ploy. Health.com: 11 healthy Super Bowl snacks . ""We know the effects of excessive snacks are quite adverse to people's health. If you drink a lot of beer, you aren't going to get all the attractive women,"" says Frederick J. Zimmerman, Ph.D., an economist and professor of health services at the UCLA School of Public Health. ""That may seem obvious, but those images work on us on a subconscious level."" Zimmerman believes the true culprit behind the obesity epidemic isn't high-fructose corn syrup, sodium, or saturated fat, per se, but rather the ubiquitous marketing that makes foods containing those ingredients appealing to Americans. In his research on the health effects of television on children (and more recently adults), Zimmerman found that the number of commercials people see is more closely linked to the risk of being overweight or obese than the total time they spend watching TV. Health.com: How junk foods are marketed to kids . And the subconscious impact of Super Bowl ads might be even greater than that of everyday commercials, because the ads are part of the entertainment, Harris says. ""If you see a commercial trying to give you information, you know exactly what it's doing,"" she says. ""But if you're just being entertained, you're not looking at it in that same way, which is probably what makes it more effective."" The power of advertising has largely had a negative effect on our health, but in theory that power could be harnessed for good, says Jonathan H. Whiteson, M.D., who has seen the fallout from the obesity epidemic firsthand as the director of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation at New York University's Langone Medical Center. ""We're led to the watering hole -- or really to the burger and the beer,""  Whiteson says. ""If fruit companies and tap water companies were advertising, we'd be going in that direction instead."" Can commercials make you hungry? Research suggests that TV commercials can prompt you to eat. Advertising triggers an ""automatic eating response"" that can make you eat more of ""basically any food that's in front of you,"" Harris says. Health.com: How the pros curb food cravings http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20394811,00.html . This effect was demonstrated during an experiment that Harris and her colleagues at the Rudd Center conducted in 2009. The researchers randomly divided 98 young adults into three groups and showed each group an episode of the TV show Whose Line Is It Anyway? The participants were told that the study was about the effect of TV on mood. The episodes the groups watched were identical -- except for the commercial breaks. One version contained ads for junk foods (such as candy, soda, and fast food) that emphasized ""fun and excitement,"" another version had ads for nutritious foods (such as oatmeal and OJ), and a third version contained no food advertising at all. (All three versions had some nonfood commercials as well.) After watching the show, the study participants were moved to another room, where they were told that they could eat as much as they wanted from an array of snack foods, ranging from healthy (vegetables and dip) to not so healthy (cookies). The participants who saw the unhealthy snack commercials ate the most food -- even if they reported not feeling hungry. The volunteers in experiments like these generally don't think that advertising can affect their behavior in this way, Harris says. ""Most people believe they have more control over everything than they actually do,"" she says. ""Once people know they are influenced, then they're better able to control behaviors."" Commercials and parties: a dangerous combo? Super Bowl partygoers probably won't have to go far to fulfill their cravings for the soda, chips, and other foods that they see in high definition. There appears to be a certain synergy between Super Bowl ads and the menu at most Super Bowl parties. Health.com: The ultimate TV party . A 2001 study in the Journal of Marketing Communications that analyzed the ""likability"" of every Super Bowl ad that aired in the 1990s found that viewers consistently ranked ads from ""party-food marketers"" -- including Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi, and Frito-Lay -- high on the likability scale. By contrast, ads for ""party-busting products"" such as over-the-counter medications were far less popular with viewers. ""Consumers are sending a clear message that certain products interest them more than others during Super Bowl broadcasts,"" the authors concluded. ""It is a good strategy to continue to advertise food and beverage products extensively during the Super Bowl because consumption peaks during the game."" Indeed, Americans are said to consume more food on Super Bowl Sunday than on any day of the year except Thanksgiving. According to Whiteson, that's not such a good thing. ""A little bit of soda is okay, a hot dog is okay,"" he says, but he adds that even just one day of excessive drinking or gorging on chips and soda is enough to do real harm. (Some studies suggest that a big meal can even trigger a heart attack.) Super Bowl may trigger heart attacks . The larger problem, Whiteson says, is that the dynamic on Super Bowl Sunday isn't all that unusual. The relationship between TV commercials and unhealthy eating may be more pronounced on the biggest football day of the year, but it's simply an exaggerated version of what has become a part of everyday life. ""The foods that are eaten are a reflection of what people are doing throughout the year, not an isolated event,"" Whiteson says.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Thousands of people, many of them Iranian government supporters, turned up in Tehran on Wednesday for the funeral of a man killed in anti-government protests. The gathering near Tehran University followed a crackdown on anti-government protests Monday and Tuesday's calls from Iranian lawmakers for the execution of opposition leaders. Government officials said 26-year-old Sana Jaleh was shot to death Monday by members of an outlawed group called the People's Mujahedeen Organization of Iran. The group, which is also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq, has opposed the Iranian government for decades. Government officials also claim that Jaleh was part of the pro-government Basij militia, but some who knew Jaleh dispute that account. And in a statement Wednesday, the People's Mujahedeen called the government's version of events ""a preposterous lie."" According to the group, it was the Iranian authorities who fired on the demonstrators. ""These desperate attempts and ludicrous allegations against the PMOI, much like clerical regime's other attempts at shutting down the internet and mobile phones, or jamming satellite television broadcasts, will prove fruitless for the shaky clerical regime,"" the group said. ""The uprising and the struggle of the Iranian people shall continue until the downfall of the ruling religious fascism and the establishment of democracy."" The semi-official Fars news agency also blamed the People's Mujahedeen for a second reported death in Monday's protests. Fars reported that the victim, identified as Mohammad Mokhtari, was buried on Wednesday in southern Tehran, where mourners blamed Iranian opposition leaders for his death and called for their execution. Similar calls came during Jaleh's funeral procession, with demonstrators shouting anti-American slogans and holding signs calling for the prosecution of opposition leaders Mehdi Karrubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi. Iranian lawmakers Tuesday called for Karrubi and Moussavi to be put to death. In an interview with state-run news agency IRNA, Iranian judiciary spokesman Gholam-Hussein Mohseni-Ejei said Wednesday that ""The people have demanded the execution of these people ... and the judiciary will fulfill its duty."" Last week, the Iranian government rounded up activists after Karrubi and Moussavi called for supporters to gather at Azadi Square -- the site of mass protests by Iran's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections. Despite the security presence, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in Tehran on Monday. Meanwhile, the opposition-run Saham News website reported that at least 20 security agents broke into the home of Karrubi's son, Hossein Karrubi, on Wednesday. Karrubi was not in the apartment at the time, but the agents broke down the door, ransacked his home, and destroyed much of his belongings, Saham News reported. Iran's government has praised Egyptian demonstrators who brought down President Hosni Mubarak's iron-fisted rule, but at the same time is cracking down on protesters decrying its own hardline regime. Mubarak resigned on Friday after 18 days of protests, and similar unrest has broken out in several other Middle Eastern states.","NEW: Fars news agency reports a second protester was killed Monday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The judge delayed a decision on allowing a new lawyer to join Dr. Conrad Murray's defense team until he can determine if there is a conflict of interest. The lawyer, Nareg Gourjian, had worked on Michael Jackson's child molestation defense. Murray, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson, wants Gourjian to replace Joseph Low, who left the defense team earlier this month. Gourjian's former law firm, headed by lawyer Mark Geragos, raised the possible conflict of interest before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor at a hearing Tuesday. ""We have a great amount of respect for Mr. Gourjian, but it is our duty to disclose his participation in our past representation for Mr. Jackson,"" Geragos and Geragos attorney Pat Harris said. The Geragos firm represented Jackson for two years starting in 2003, when he was charged with child molestation. Jackson replaced Geragos with Thomas Mesereau in 2004, saying he wanted an attorney who would devote his full time to his case. Geragos was also defending Scott Peterson, who was charged with murdering his wife, at the same time. Gourjian told the judge he was ""in no way inolved"" in the Jackson case because he was ""a brand-new lawyer"" busy working on the Scott Peterson murder case at the time. The decision rests on if Gourjian's work for Jackson was ""substantially related"" to the current case and if his work for the defense would require ""Gourjian to attempt to discredit his former client directly or indirectly,"" Pastor said. The judge delayed a decision until more facts are provided by Geragos and there is a response from the lawyer for Michael Jackson's estate. Mark Geragos will be asked to appear at the next hearing on February 24, the judge said. Murray is also represented by Houston lawyer Ed Chernoff and J. Michael Flanagan of Los Angeles. The defense demanded a speedy trial at last month's arraignment, the trial to start by the end of March. Jury selection is now set for March 24.

"(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator whose dead daughter and injured son were found in his truck has been charged with attempted murder, and police were searching his Miami home Thursday night, police said. Chase Scott, spokesman for West Palm Beach Police, told CNN that officers were executing a search warrant for evidence in the home of Jorge and Carmen Barahona. Jorge Barahona, 53, was found unconscious beside his pest-control truck early Monday along a south Florida interstate by a road assistance ranger, along with his 10-year-old adopted son, who was inside the vehicle next to an open gas can, according to a probable-cause affidavit filed by detectives. Hours later, crews removing toxic chemicals from the truck discovered the boy's twin sister dead in a plastic bag. Earlier Thursday, Barahona was taken to a hospital Thursday after he ""attempted to harm himself,"" police said. Barahona, who was in custody in the Palm Beach County Jail, suffered a self-inflicted injury after deputies told him to get ready to go to a court hearing Thursday morning, West Palm Beach Police spokesman Scott Chase said. ""He immediately attempted to harm himself by thrusting himself backwards, causing an injury to his head,"" Chase said. ""He was immediately checked by emergency personnel and it was decided he was OK to appear in court."" However, Barahona ""refused to cooperate"" by not speaking and the judge decided to delay the hearing until another date, Chase said. Authorities later decided to take Barahona to Wellington Regional Medical Center for observation, he said. Meanwhile, a medical examiner has determined a cause of death for the girl, but it will not be made public until investigators review the findings, Chase said Thursday. Authorities likely will decide whether and how to charge Barahona in her death based on the autopsy results, Police Capt. Mary Olsen said Wednesday. The children were among the four the Barahonas adopted from Florida's foster care system. When the boy was found Monday by the roadside assistance ranger, he ""appeared to be in respiratory distress and (was) trembling"" and his clothing ""was soaked with an unknown chemical,"" the probable-cause affidavit said. The ranger then found Barahona on the ground beside the truck and called for help. The boy was hospitalized in intensive care with severe burns to his abdomen, upper thighs and buttocks, the affidavit said. While examining the boy, doctors noted he had sustained previous injuries, including a broken collarbone, a broken arm, scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen, and ligature marks on both wrists, police said. After Barahona and his son were taken to a hospital, a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl, wrapped in a plastic bag, the document said. Barahona told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter, and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire, the affidavit said. Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added. ""Basically, to paraphrase, he was stating that he placed his daughter in a plastic bag being distraught over her death,"" Chase told reporters Wednesday. ""He drove here from South Florida accompanied by his son. ""He then pulled off to the side of the road saying that he poured gas on his self, intending to light himself on fire. His son's head was in his lap and he decided, after giving his son some sleeping pills, that he wasn't going to do that."" Barahona told police that in dousing himself with gasoline, he inadvertently got some on the boy, Olsen said Wednesday. But his story doesn't add up, because there was no gasoline on the boy, she said. Instead, he was covered with another chemical whose composition had yet to be determined. ""That's why we're still treating this as a hazmat (hazardous materials case),"" Olsen said. The truck in which the children were found was taken to a secure location, Chase said, where an FBI evidence recovery team is going through the vehicle. Authorities are waiting for test results on the chemicals found in the truck. Chase said the substance on the boy's body and clothes was so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well. The boy, who was transferred Wednesday morning to a specialized burn unit at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, has not been able to talk to investigators because he is on a breathing tube, Olsen explained. Asked whether Barahona has expressed remorse, she said, ""He feels remorse, but we're not getting consistent statements with what we're seeing in our evidence."" ""It's a complex case,"" she added. At a hearing Wednesday in Miami attended by Barahona's wife, Carmen, a judge ordered that the remaining two children in the home be placed in foster care. Florida's Department of Children and Families had opened a child protection investigation within the past few days to look into a complaint involving the Barahona family, and it wasn't the first such complaint, spokesman Mark Riordan said. Reporters in the courtroom Wednesday heard tales of abuse, mainly concerning the twins, from state officials and experts. The caller to the child protection hotline in the latest case reported that the twins were routinely locked in a bathroom for long periods of time and had been bound with tape, the court heard. The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court. An investigator told the court that she went to the family's home on February 11 but had not seen the children. Instead, she said, she left after speaking with Carmen Barahona, planning to return on Monday. Asked why she did not return sooner, she said, ""I'm not allowed to do investigations on a weekend."" However, a spokesman for the department, John Harrell, said it is the job of investigators to follow through immediately or refer to someone else in the department to follow through when a matter is urgent. CNN's Kim Segal contributed to this report.","NEW: Jorge Barahona is charged with attempted murder; home is being searched .

"(CNN) -- The unrest spreading through North Africa and the Middle East has reached the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain, according to reports from the state news agency. At least three police officers and one demonstrator have been injured in clashes, the news agency reported. The injuries occurred during an attack on a police station during protests Sunday evening, the news agency said. After three officers were injured, police fired on protesters with rubber bullets, causing one injury, the news agency said. Further protests were scheduled to take place in Bahrain on Monday, making the country the latest in a string of nations to experience popular protests that began in Tunisia. Protesters who have organized on Facebook, Twitter and with e-mails want political reforms, including a constitutional monarchy.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has apologized after he was fined by the European Tour for spitting on the 12th green during the final round of the Dubai Desert Classic. The world number three endured a torrid Sunday and was caught on camera spitting near the hole after missing a par putt when playing with Sergio Garcia, from Spain. Woods has been fined an undisclosed amount after European Tour officials reviewed footage of the incident. The former world number one took to Twitter on Monday to express his remorse: ""The Euro Tour is right -- it was inconsiderate to spit like that and I know better. Just wasn't thinking and want to say I'm sorry."" Woods flops as Quiros aces his way to Dubai victory . He added: ""Everyone was terrific all week, fans especially. Dubai is always a fantastic host. Just wish the week could have ended better."" A spokesman for the European Tour told CNN: ""The tournament director, Mike Stewart, feels there has been a Breach of the Tour Code of Conduct and consequently Tiger Woods will be fined."" Woods went into the final round on Sunday just one shot off the lead but struck a three-over-par 75 to sink down the leaderboard. It was his worst round as a professional on a regular European Tour event and he finished in 20th place. He was visibly irritated as it became clear his 14-month title drought was set to continue and afterwards described his play as ""very frustrating"" on the European Tour's official website. ""I got off to such a poor start -- I was two-over through three early and just couldn't make it up from there. ""But there were quite a few positives this week. Also a couple of glaring examples of what I need to work on, which is good. I'll go to work next week."" The tournament was eventually won by Spain's Alvaro Quiros, who carded a hole-in-one during his round of 68 to finish on 11-under. Woods' next appearance will be at the Accenture World Match Play Championship in Tuscon, Arizona. Meanwhile, D.A. Points recorded his first PGA Tour victory Sunday, taking the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am title alongside playing partner, actor Bill Murray.

"(CNN) -- Capt.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger a flag and license plate. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, first lady Maria Shriver and other dignitaries greeted Sullenberger at the state Capitol rotunda in Sacramento. Taking a break from difficult negotiations over a troubled state budget, the governor presented Sullenberger with a jacket with the state seal, a California state flag that had flown over the state Capitol, a proclamation and a ""California Hero"" license plate. ""Today is a very important day,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""There are legislators upstairs that are negotiating and working on a budget -- [we] need a great hero in a state capitol.""

"Miami (CNN) -- A Florida father found in a contaminated pest control truck with his seriously injured son and a bagged body has been charged with aggravated child abuse, authorities said Tuesday night. George Barahona, 53, will likely face other charges from the ""complicated"" investigation, said Chase Scott, a spokesman for the West Palm Beach Police Department. The incident began Monday morning when a pest control truck pulled to the side of Interstate 95 in the West Palm Beach area. Firefighters called to the scene found the man and boy suffering from some type of illness, Scott said. Barahona and his son, Victor, 10, were rushed to hospitals in serious condition, Scott said. The father is in intensive care in another hospital, but is lucid and has talked with investigators, police said. The charge is related to his 10-year-old son. The boy suffered burns and injuries from inhaling unknown contaminants, Scott said. ""He is in a difficult medical condition"" and is in isolation. ""He did suffer some burns from the chemicals that were on his clothing and his body,"" Scott said. Investigators found in the rear of a truck a somewhat deteriorated bagged body. Workers had to don emergency hazardous materials outfits and wrapped the body twice more to limit exposure. The workers were later decontaminated. Police don't know how long father and son were exposed to the toxins, Scott said. ""They were incredibly toxic chemicals."" The body was taken to the county medical examiner's office for positive identification, said Scott, adding investigators have an idea of who it might be. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining the truck and chemicals, Scott said. The entire vehicle, which was emitting fumes, is covered in unidentified chemicals, according to Scott. The FBI has been asked to assist; it is taking samples to identify the makeup of what Scott described as a highly toxic liquid. Neighbors of Barahona told reporters that he is an exterminator. Within the past few days a child protection investigation had been opened to look into a complaint involving the Barahona family, said Florida Department of Children and Families spokesman Mark Riordan. The agency is responsible for investigating allegations of abuse, abandonment and neglect of a minor. He would not elaborate on the nature of the complaint in this case, but said the agency has investigated complaints about the family in the past, ""Several times we've been out to the home,"" he said. The Barahonas had adopted four children, including Victor, from Florida's foster care system, Riordan said. Police have spoken with Victor's mother, Scott said. ""We're in the preliminary stages of an extremely tragic, complex set of circumstances,"" Riordan said. ""We're working side by side with law enforcement from two jurisdictions to make sure from DCF's perspective that the children are safe."" To ensure their safety, the ""remaining"" children have been removed from the family home and have been placed with a close relative, Riordan told CNN. He would not specify how many children were removed. Law enforcement officials in West Palm Beach are handling the death investigation, while authorities in the Miami area, where the Barahona home is located, are looking into the family and the safety of the children, Riordan said. Scott said some firefighters became sick from fumes coming from the vehicle, but they have all been treated and released. A guard and others at the hospital where the boy was taken also complained of feeling ill. CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report .","NEW: Father charged with aggravated child abuse .

"Orlando (CNN) -- A high school sophomore in Orlando who throws a mean fastball but was cut from his baseball team because he's not so good at fielding bunts said Tuesday that his rejection was off-base. ""I went there and tried out and the coach gave me the excuse that I can't cover bunts,"" 16-year-old Anthony Burruto told HLN's ""Prime News"" about his coach's decision at Dr. Phillips High School. ""Bunts wasn't even part of the tryout."" And Burruto's 80-mph fastball just wasn't enough, apparently. Oh, there's another thing about Burruto that may -- or may not -- have anything to do with this story. Life threw him a curve that other athletes at the school have not had to contend with: He has no legs. Burruto launches his pitches from atop prostheses. But the birth defect never deterred him from pursuing the sport: He has played baseball since he was 8, playing two seasons in the fall league and one on the junior varsity team. ""They know what he's got,"" Burruto's mother Diane said about the school's coaches. ""He's a very good athlete, very good pitcher. He handles his own out there."" She said her son worked hard to hone his skills. ""Not to say other kids out there don't work hard, but Anthony has to work harder. He loves the game of baseball."" She added, ""He became skilled at it, he excelled at it, and had to overcome obstacles, obviously, to get there. Nothing can stop him. That's the way I raised him. You don't have a disability. You want to do something? Go out and try to do it."" In a written statement, a spokesman for the Orange County Public Schools said Burruto was treated like any other player. ""Anthony was given the same opportunity as all other students to try out for the Dr. Phillips High School baseball teams,"" wrote Dylan Thomas. ""He was among 63 student athletes who were evaluated for a position on either the varsity or junior varsity squads. With only 40 roster spots, Anthony and 22 other students did not make either team. As a sophomore, Anthony has the chance to vie for a position on a school team again next year and we hope he will."" But Burruto said he was not sure he would, particularly if the coach who cut him keeps his job. ""I would never play for him again,"" Burruto said. ""He basically told me that I'm not going to make the team ever again because I can't field the bunts, which isn't true. I can field bunts -- just a little slower than the average person."" Burruto said his former teammates have been incredulous when they learned he has been cut. ""Their reaction is, 'Oh, my God! Are you serious? There's no way! How can you get cut?' They're livid about it.""","16-year-old Anthony Burruto throws an 80 mph fastball .

"(CNN) -- Park Ji-Sung's Manchester United return has been put on hold after the South Korean midfielder suffered an injury in training. The English Premier League leaders had been without the 29-year-old for the past six weeks while he was at the Asian Cup in Qatar, and he now faces another month on the sidelines. Park injured a hamstring injury on Friday ahead of the Manchester derby, and will now miss United's European Champions League last-16 clash with Marseille in France on February 23. ""It was very unfortunate because it was his last kick of the ball in training,"" team manager Alex Ferguson told the club's website on Tuesday. Has Rooney joined the ranks of football's immortals? ""We were really looking forward to having him back after being away for a month at the Asian Cup. He'll be out for up to a month, which is a blow to us."" The winger has not played for the English Premier League leaders since the 2-0 win over Sunderland on December 26. Park was part of the South Korea squad which reached the semifinals of January's Asian Cup before losing to eventual champions Japan. The former PSV Eindhoven star announced his international retirement after the tournament, citing a persistent right-knee injury as one of the reasons for his decision. Park will also miss Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round match with non-league minnows Crawley Town as well as Premier League trips to Wigan, Chelsea and Liverpool, but may be back in time for the second leg against the French champions on March 15. Cup magic shared by cross-channel minnows Crawley and Chambery . In better news for United, Ecuador winger Antonio Valencia is back in training after breaking his ankle in a Champions League match against Scottish side Rangers in September. ""Valencia started training with the reserves on Saturday,"" Ferguson said. ""So he's on his way back and that will be a real boost to have him available for the run-in."" Valencia signed from Wigan for a reported $27 million in July 2009.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Iran poses a significant threat to Iraq, but security has greatly improved in the war-ravaged country, according to a Pentagon report. Iraqi soldiers parade in Kirkuk on January 10. The Pentagon credits better forces for improved security. The Pentagon assessed progress in Iraq from September to November in its quarterly report to Congress, issued on Tuesday. Iran ""continues to reflect a fundamental desire to oppose the development of a fully secure and stable Iraq,"" despite its ""persistent promises to the contrary,"" the report said. Iran tried to undermine the U.S.-Iraqi security agreement forged last year, the report said, and ""continues to host, train, fund, arm, and direct militant groups intent on destabilizing Iraq."" ""Countering malign influence and balancing soft Iranian influence remain priorities to stabilize Iraq and ensure the sovereignty of its people,"" the report said. The report cites improvements in politics, security, economics, diplomacy and rule of law, but emphasizes their fragility. ""Iraq remains fragile because its major power brokers do not share a unified national vision. They disagree on the nature of the state and are reluctant to share power and resources,"" it says. ""The overall security situation in Iraq continues to improve,"" the Pentagon report says, crediting, among other things, improved Iraqi security forces and the political will of the government to fight militants. It says the insurgency has diminished as some militants embrace the Iraqi government. The U.S.-led coalition has transferred security leadership to Iraqi forces in several provinces and coalition troops from many countries have withdrawn their forces. The United States and Iraq have signed a bilateral security agreement calling for all U.S. troops to leave by the end of 2011. Although the number of civilians killed has dropped, assassinations of juridical and legislative officials have increased and violence against Christians in Nineveh province has stirred concern. The report raises fears that the mishandling of key political efforts in the country could reverse gains. Crucial efforts include the upcoming provincial elections, resolving disputes over areas such as Kirkuk city; resettling displaced people; and providing permanent employment for the Sons of Iraq, the largely Sunni U.S.-backed security personnel.","Pentagon report assesses progress in Iraq from September to November .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan captain Gennaro Gattuso has apologised for head-butting Tottenham assistant manager Joe Jordan at the end of Tuesday's stormy Champions League clash at the San Siro. Gattuso had already had an altercation with 59-year-old Jordan, who ironically starred for Milan during his playing career, earlier in Tottenham's 1-0 win, before the two went head-to-head again at the final whistle. Speaking to the media following Milan's defeat, Gattuso said: ""I lost my head and I'm taking responsibility because I did something I shouldn't have done. Why Gattuso has to lose his cool . ""I was annoyed about the words I'd exchanged with Jordan earlier. We were both speaking Scottish given that I played in his country in Glasgow but I'm not going to say what was said. ""I made a mistake doing what I did to an older person, and that's it. I will wait and see what UEFA decides now,"" he added. And European football's governing body UEFA have already issued a statement saying: ""UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Gennaro Gattuso after the incidents that took place after the match between AC Milan and  Tottenham. ""The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body will meet next Monday February 21 to discuss this case."" Gattuso's behavior drew widespread condemnation, with his own coach Massimiliano Allegri expecting his player to be disciplined. Allegri told a press conference: ""It was an unpleasant episode, I really don't know why it happened."" ""I didn't like this episode, it's not nice to see, of course it will be looked at by UEFA, there was certainly a reason that he behaved this way but you can't excuse it."" Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp added: ""Gattuso had a flair-up with Joe Jordan. I don't know why. He obviously hasn't done his homework. He really could have picked a fight with someone other than Joe. ""He put his head into Joe's face for some reason. It was crazy. He lost his head during the game.""","Gennaro Gattuso apologises for his behavior against AC Milan on Tuesday .

"(CNN)  -- A late goal from Peter Crouch stunned seven-time European champions AC Milan as Tottenham Hotspur secured a 1-0 win in the San Siro on Tuesday night. Crouch converted after a brilliant run from fellow England international Aaron Lennon to give Tottenham a precious lead for their home tie of the Champions League last 16 knockout tie. Earlier in the second half, Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes produced two wonder saves to keep AC Milan at bay, both from Mario Yepes. First, the Brazilian stretched to palm over a header which looked destined for the top corner and then repeated the trick from another fierce header which he pushed out. After Crouch's 80th minute goal, Milan went in desperate search of an equalizer and Robinho's close range effort was blocked by the excellent Michael Dawson. Deep into injury time, Milan thought they had equalized through a Zlatan Ibrahimovic overhead kick, but the Swedish striker had pushed Dawson and it was ruled out. At the final whistle there were unsavory scenes as Milan midfielder Gennaro Gatusso clashed with Tottenham assistant coach Joe Jordan, headbutting the former Scottish international. The two had earlier exchanged words after former Arsenal star Mathieu Flamini was yellow carded for an ugly two-footed challenge on Vedran Corluka which left the Tottenham defender on crutches. He was replaced by Jonathan Woodgate, making his first appearance after a lengthy injury layoff. Gatusso, who had earlier been booked, will miss the second leg but could be punished further by UEFA for the incident which was captured on television. Jubilant Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said all his players had contributed to the famous victory. ""The whole team were magnificent, everyone did their job tonight, it was a great night for Tottenham,"" he told Sky Sports. Tottenham had the better of the first half with the home side handicapped by the loss of goalkeeper Christian Abbiati, who was taken to hospital with a head injury after being stretchered off after a awkward fall. Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri replaced him with Marco Amelia and he was kept the busier of the two goalkeepers. Early in the second half, Amelia could only watch as a Rafael van der Vaart chip went narrowly side, but then Milan, sparked by the introduction of Pato, at last began to show the form which has taken them top of Serie A this season. Tuesday's other first leg tie saw veteran Spain striker Raul return to Spain with his new German side Schalke and score a vital equalizer in the 1-1 draw against Valencia. Roberto Soldado's sixth Champions League goal put Valencia ahead on 17 minutes in the Mestella, but 33-year-old veteran Raul, who moved to Schalke from Real Madrid in the summer, leveled on 64 minutes. Raul is the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League and the away goal is one of his most valuable ahead of the second leg in Gelsenkirchen on March 9. Schalke's draw was only spoiled by a late sending off for Lukas Schmitz but they held on with 10 men.","Tottenham Hotspur beat AC Milan 1-0 in the San Siro with Peter Crouch scoring .

"(CNN) -- Roland Garros will continue to host the French Open after the country's tennis officials rejected a move to a different part of the capital Paris. Three groups had made bids to host the annual clay-court tournament, one of the four Grand Slams on offer during the season, from 2016 onwards. The iconic Roland Garros site, which has hosted the French Open since its inception 86 years ago, will now be expanded and revamped. French Tennis Federation president Jean Gachassin said in a statement: ""We back the project to create a new Roland Garros venue, extending and modernizing the historic venue at Porte d'Auteuil. CNN's Top 10 French Open moments . ""It's a historic choice, probably the most important for our federation since its creation. Our aim was to offer an ambitious project. ""This decision has been made against the fashion for having things on giant scales but it's a project which is resolutely focused on the future. This hasn't been a default choice. The Paris project was the most beautiful of the four."" Spain's Rafael Nadal took the men's crown last year while Italian Francesca Schiavone won the women's title. Meanwhile, Milos Raonic became the first Canadian to clinch an ATP World Tour title since 1995 after beating defending champion Fernando Verdasco 7-6 7-6 at the SAP Open in San Jose, California. The 20-year-old was ranked 84th before the tournament but moved up to 59th when the new world rankings were released Monday. Despite playing in his first final Raonic showed few signs of nerves as he survived four set points in the opener, recovering from 2-6 down in the tie-break to take it. He secured the title thanks to another tie-break in the second. Raonic told the ATP Tour website: ""I sort of used up my luck today, in a way. I got out of that first set and the second set I was a little bit more confident by then. It came out the way I wanted it to."" Raonic didn't drop a set in the tournament and finished with 58 aces in his four matches, including 13 in the final. World number nine Verdasco was impressed by his opponent. He said: ""He has good potential and he has one of the best serves, and also on the baseline he plays so aggressive. ""The moments he needs to play solid, he plays solid and I think that he can be a top 20 player very soon.""","Roland Garros to remain as host of the French Open tournament .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Investigators in Georgia were looking Friday for a man who left the scene of a suburban Atlanta house fire that killed three children, authorities said. They said the fire was caused by a suspected methamphetamine lab in the Lilburn, Georgia, home. Gwinnett County Police Capt. Jake Smith said Ivan Gonzalez had been charged with two counts of murder Friday, a day after firefighters found him attempting to douse the blaze with a garden hose. Gonzalez, who Smith said received burns in the fire, told authorities he was a family member and was headed to the hospital to be near the children injured in the fire. Gonzalez, who is not related to the children, never reached the hospital, authorities said. Authorities checked other area hospitals and did not find Gonzalez. Gonzalez is described as 5 feet, 7 inches tall and 190 pounds, with a tattoo of the Virgin Mary on his leg. The victims, whose names were not released, are an 18-month-old girl and two boys, ages 3 and 4. Passersby pulled the children from the burning building. The children were taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. One died Thursday and the others two died Friday morning. ""The children had significant burn injuries and significant smoke inhalation injuries,"" said Gwinnett County Fire Department Capt. Tommy Rutledge. Rutledge said the fire started in a hallway between the kitchen and a stairwell in the center of the house. Smith said a third murder count is pending against Gonzalez. Neibi Brito, the victims' mother, is charged with drug trafficking, Smith said. ""The lack of responsibility, of course, is disturbing,"" Smith said. ""We have a tragic case involving three young children, but we're going to treat it professionally and not let the emotions of it get in the way of the investigation in any way.""

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund stretched their lead at the top of the German Bundesliga to 12 points but had to settle for a 0-0 draw with Schalke. The league leaders dominated against their opponents, Lucas Barrios and Mario Götze going close, but couldn't find the breakthrough. The stalemate saw them extend their lead by a point, though second-placed Bayer Leverkusen can reduce the gap to nine if they win at Nurnberg on Saturday. Dortmund should have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes as Götze and Jakub Blaszczykowski tested Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Lucas Barrios then rifled a shot narrowly wide of the post as the home side continued to press before Mats Hummels poked an effort wide from a free kick. Schalke had a half chance just before the break but former AC Milan striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar headed over the bar from Jefferson Farfan's cross. Barrios then diverted Blaszczykowski's cross onto the post with Neuer beaten as Dortmund piled on the pressure in the second half. Efforts from Lukasz Piszczek, Lukas Schmitz and Sven Bender were repelled by an inspired Neuer. Schalke had a rare chance to take the lead when former Real Madrid striker Raul put Jose Jurado through on goal, but his shot was half blocked by Roman Weidenfeller before Marcel Schmelzer cleared the ball off the line. Then Götze squandered the game's best chance as he collected Piszczek's pass and rounded Neuer but could only hit the post with a shot on the turn. Schalke moved up to ninth with their hard-earned point.","Borussia Dortmund held to a goalless draw by Schalke in German Bundesliga .

"(CNN) -- Jenni-Lynn Watson's shorthand while sending text messages came back to haunt the young man who pleaded guilty Tuesday in Syracuse, New York, to killing the college student, a prosecutor said. Although the 20-year-old victim's cell phone was never found, investigators were able to review call and text messages made by Watson and Steven Pieper, the man she was breaking up with, Onondaga County District William Fitzpatrick told CNN. After dumping Watson's body, Pieper, 21, tried to cover up by texting a mutual friend of theirs, pretending to be Watson, Fitzpatrick said. Using the letters ""GTG"" apparently did him in. Police looked at Pieper's phone, which was left November 19, 2010, at Watson's home in the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool, and pored over records, Fitzpatrick said. That shorthand for ""got to go"" was a term used by Pieper, not Watson, the prosecutor said. Pieper pleaded guilty in Onondaga County Court to second-degree murder in the strangling of Watson. Rather than 25 years to life, a plea agreement calls for him to receive a sentence of 23 years to life at the March 8 sentencing, Fitzpatrick said, adding Pieper must serve 23 years before he gets a parole hearing. ""Steven made it clear that he did not want to put the Watson family or his family through a trial in this matter, from the very beginning,"" defense attorney Scott Brenneck told CNN affiliate YNN. ""So after a review of the case, it was an appropriate way to resolve it."" CNN left messages for Brenneck on Tuesday. In late November, a massive search for Watson, a dance major, ended with the discovery of her remains at Clay Central Park in North Syracuse, the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office said. Watson and Pieper had dated on and off for 18 months and Pieper went over to Watson's home the morning of Nov. 19, authorities said. ""I don't think he went over there with the intent to kill her,"" said Fitzpatrick, adding Pieper was there about two hours. At some point the young woman told Pieper she wanted to have other relationships and he became angry and killed her, the district attorney said. The suspect allegedly placed Watson's body in her car and drove off, only to be stopped several minutes later because there was no front license plate on his vehicle, Fitzpatrick said. Pieper, who received a warning, decided then to dump the body, he said. ""He didn't have a long-term plan,"" the prosecutor said. ""On that particular day he was consumed with evil and he killed that poor little girl than no other reason than she wanted to move on with her life,"" Fitzpatrick told reporters after the hearing. Pieper initially denied involvement, Fitzpatrick said. The case against Pieper was ""strong"" and Watson's family supported the plea, he said. Watson was last seen at her family's home. She was on Thanksgiving break from Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Man pleads guilty to strangling girlfriend who was breaking up with him .

"(CNN)  -- Brazilian World Cup hero Ronaldo says he is to retire from football at the end of next year. Ronaldo, who was a member of the Brazil squad which won the 1994 World Cup and scored twice in the final in 2002 as they beat Germany, has been playing for Corinthians in his native country. The 33-year-old told the club's official Web site www.corinthians.com that he would see out his two-year contract which ends in 2011 before hanging up his boots. ""I renewed for two more years and those will be the last ones,"" he said after morning training on Monday. Ronaldo has enjoyed a glittering international career with Brazil, scoring 62 goals in 97 appearances, setting a new World Cup record with his 15th in the 2006 finals where they were knocked out in the quarterfinals. Despite his advancing years and with a string of injuries behind him, Ronaldo still holds out hopes of taking part in this year's finals in South Africa but admitted he faces a tough task in persuading Brazil coach Dunga to pick him. ""It's a thing that can still happen to me,"" he believes. But for now he has targeted South America's Libertadores Cup, having already helped Corinthians to the Paulista Championship in Brazil, scoring 12 goals in 20 appearances to show he still retains his scoring touch. ""I am determined. I want to give my best, have fun and I hope to finish by winning the Libertadores,"" he said. When he finally retires, Ronaldo will be remembered as one of the greatest footballers of all time, with a scoring rate of approaching a goal a game while plying his trade with top European club sides PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona, Real Madrid and both Internazionale and AC Milan. He is a three-time FIFA World Footballer of the Year. Ronaldo began his career in Brazil with Cruzeiro and returned to turn out for Corinthians after another serious knee injury while playing for Milan appeared to signal his playing days were over. But he has defied his critics, and after initially training with Flamengo, settled on the Corinthians and is set to act as an ambassador at the Parque San Jorge after he quits.","World Cup record goal scorer Ronaldo is to retire next year .

"(CNN Student News) -- February 9, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Korean Peninsula • Australia • Detroit, Michigan . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: How can you trust what you read online? We've got some of your answers coming up in this Wednesday edition of CNN Student News. Bringing you today's headlines, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Korea Military Talks . AZUZ: Our first stop today: the Korean Peninsula, for talks between the North and South. Representatives from the two countries are back at it today after a full day of talks yesterday. This is the first time in eight months that North and South Korea have had direct contact with each other. The silence started after the South blamed the North for two military attacks last year. These talks are happening at a truce village. The representatives didn't come to any conclusions yesterday, but they said there weren't any political arguments from either side. The goal of these meetings is to set up another round of talks between officials who are higher up in their countries' governments. South Korea says it'll only agree to those if North Korea promises not to provoke the South any more. Australia Brushfires . AZUZ: Next up, Australia, where officials are promising one million dollars to a fund for wildfire victims. We've talked recently about floods and a cyclone in eastern Australia. These fires were in western Australia, on the other side of the country. The flames burned more than a thousand acres of land and damaged or destroyed more than 60 buildings. Anyone who lost their home will immediately get $3,000 from the government. Tegan Sapwell of Australia's Ten Network was on hand as residents returned home to see the damage. She checks in now with some of the victims' reactions and an explanation of how these fires started. Tegan? (BEGIN VIDEO) TEGAN SAPWELL, TEN NETWORK REPORTER: It's absolutely heartbreaking to see what people are going through here. There's just so many stories, and each one of them really touches your heart. A short time ago, a man returned to the home here behind me where he saw what was left of his house for the first time. It was obviously incredibly emotional. But what really struck me was as he was leaving, he walked away and shrugged his shoulders and said, ""Oh well, you know, I'll just rebuild."" I think that really shows the real Aussie spirit there. Another example: I spoke to a couple earlier today that had tears pouring down their faces as they spoke about what they lost. But all they wanted to do was to thank the firefighters for their efforts for putting their lives on the line as they tried to save their home. So, I think that's just amazing. What's actually believed to have happened is it was sparked by a power tool. On Sunday, conditions here were just hot and windy. And as a result, we had what's called a total fire ban, which means people aren't allowed to use power tools. What's actually believed to have happened is a resident was using a power tool. He's actually a police officer. And that is what started the fire. As a result, he now faces possible criminal charges over this. It's a very serious matter, and the arson squad is now investigating. (END VIDEO) What's the Word? JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? it's the name for the process by which a bank takes back a home because the owner can't make payments . FORECLOSURE . That's the word! Detroit Foreclosures . AZUZ: So in a foreclosure, the homeowner loses the house. And when you get a lot of foreclosures in one area, it can bring down the value of all the houses nearby. The mayor of Detroit has an idea to fill up some of the foreclosed homes in his city: sell them to police officers and firefighters! The mayor's proposal is to offer police and firefighters the chance to buy foreclosed homes for as little as $1,000 dollars. Plus, they could get money to do some renovations. This would be paid for by private investors and with government money that's supposed to help redevelop the city. The mayor says the idea could help more than just the housing market. MAYOR DAVE BING, DETROIT, MICHIGAN: Police officers living in their neighborhoods have the potential to deter crime, increase public safety, and improve relations between the community and our sworn officers. Testing Toyotas . AZUZ: The U.S. Department of Transportation has spent 10 months investigating why some Toyota vehicles sped up for no apparent reason. In 2008 and 2009, we reported on when the car company recalled millions of cars because of this problem. Some critics thought it might have been caused by the vehicles' electronic throttle systems. But according to the testing, that's not the case. The government says, so far, the only known causes of the problem are sticky pedals and floor mats that got in the way of the pedals. Officials say it's also possible that drivers may have gotten confused and pushed the gas instead of the brake. Toyota is facing hundreds of lawsuits related to this issue. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Dich's world geography class at Horning Middle School in Waukesha, Wisconsin! The words algebra, hazard and mummy all come from what language? You know what to do here! Is it: A) Greek, B) Arabic, C) Hindi or D) English? You've got three seconds -- GO! All of these words can be traced back to the Arabic language. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Mandatory Arabic? AZUZ: At my high school, we could choose to take French, Spanish or German. We had to take a language, but we got to pick which one. At some schools in Texas, a plan was being considered to require students to take Arabic. The school district got a grant from the U.S. Department of Education that would make Arabic classes mandatory at some schools. The plan is now being reconsidered, but as Sharrie Williams of affiliate KTVT reports, the original idea still angered some parents. (BEGIN VIDEO) SHARRIE WILLIAMS, REPORTER, KTVT: All over the room, there were questions. JOSEPH BALSON, PARENT: Why are we just now finding out about it? WILLIAMS: Dozens of concerned parents showed up at Cross Timbers Intermediate School to speak with Mansfield ISD Superintendent Dr. Bob Morrison. The district was awarded a federal grant last summer to teach the Arabic language. BARON KANE, PARENT: The school does not teach Christianity, so I don't want them teaching the Islam. WILLIAMS: The district stressed the curriculum would not be about religion, but about the language and culture, similar to the Spanish curriculum already in place. But upset parents say they should have been informed months ago about the grant. BALSON: It's them applying for the grant and getting it approved, and now saying they're going to be able to go back and change it, only after they were caught trying to implement this plan without any of the parents knowing about it. WILLIAMS: The grant, known as the Foreign Language Assistance Program, has identified Arabic as a language of the future. Some parents say teaching it in the Mansfield ISD is a good idea. TRISHA SAVAGE, PARENT: I think it's a great opportunity. I think it, you know, not only opens doors and we... I think globally, act locally. WILLIAMS: Kheirieh Hannun was born in Palestine but raised in the U.S. She says the option to learn Arabic will give her son a chance to know more about his culture and hopefully broaden the minds of not only students, but also parents. KHEIRIEH HANNUN, PARENT: It was surprising, but I think it's OK. And I think it would be fine, because that way you'll cut down on the stereotype. (END VIDEO) Blog Report . AZUZ: Take your opinion on this to the web. Our blog is at CNNStudentNews.com. Our Facebook site is Facebook.com/CNNStudentNews. Here we go now with your responses to the ""tree octopus"" experiment: How do you know that what you see online is the truth? Kelly suggests ""you should check and see who the author or publisher of the article is. You should also check other web sites to see if they have similar results."" Brooks agrees ""you definitely have to check your sources,"" something we hear in journalism an awful lot. ""If you get the wrong info, you can be in trouble. Validate your source; you'll be happy that you did."" And the first thing Kuba's teacher says to do is to check at least five web sites to see if the info is used more than once. If so, it's more than 80 percent true. Interesting idea there. ""I think it is in teachers' best interest that they work on finding reliable sources for the students. Not to do the work for them, but to make sure they know how to find a source."" This from Matthew. Caitlyn at Facebook.com/CNNStudentNews says to check the publisher or to ask the teacher if the web site has accurate info. ""If you write a paper for a class, you wouldn't want inaccurate information."" And Terrance says simply: ""People need to stop believing everything they read on the internet."" Before We Go . AZUZ: Well, before we go, coaches usually give their time to players. But this one gave a lot more than that. Coach Tom Walter gave Kevin Jordan a kidney! He recruited Kevin to play on the Wake Forest baseball team. When Kevin got sick and needed a kidney transplant, turned out his coach was a match! The transplant surgery was done earlier this week, and doctors say Kevin could be back on the field by the 2012 season. Goodbye . AZUZ: An awesome story and our best wishes to Kevin and his coach.

"(CNN)  -- Two late goals from Robin van Persie and Andrey Arshavin gave Arsenal a 2-1 win over Spanish champions Barcelona in their last 16, first leg tie at the Emirates Wednesday night. Barcelona led through a 26th minute goal from David Villa and might have added to their tally as Lionel Messi endured a frustrating night. But Dutch international van Persie, who had threatened to score in the first half, latched on to a pass from Gael Clichy and beat Victor Valdes at his near post for a 78th minute equalizer. Arshavin capped a dream comeback for Arsene Wenger's men with a curling shot past Valdes five minutes later after the ball had been perfectly laid into his path by Samir Nasri. Messi, who missed a gilt-edged opening early in the first half, was crowded out by desperate Arsenal defense as Barca pushed for an equalizer, but to no avail. ""It was a great game betweeen two special teams,"" Wenger told ITV Sport. ""We suffered for some spells in the game but never gave up,"" he added. His Barcelona counterpart Pep Guardiola believes his men will emerge on top after the second leg on their home ground. ""I think we more or less controlled the game and we just need to create the chances we did tonight in the Nou Camp and then take them. ""It will be an open game I am sure. Yes we have lost tonight, but we still have the second leg,"" he said. Guardiola may well have been referring to his talisman Messi, who burst through with a typical run after a bright opening by the home side. The Argentina ace looked certain to score but sent his chipped effort just wide. Van Persie had seen his volleyed effort saved by Valdes and came within a whisker of heading home a Cesc Fabregas cross, only for Eric Abidal to make a timely interception. But in the next attack, Barcelona were ahead as Messi played in Villa to score neatly. A Messi header was disallowed for a marginal offside decision and he shot into the side netting after another typical burst into the penalty area, but Arsenal were also a threat going forward in an open game. The prolific Van Persie scored his 13th goal of an injury-truncated season and Arshavin's winner, after a flowing Arsenal move reminiscent of Barcelona at their best, capped a memorable night for the Gunners. In Wednesday's other Champions League action, Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk scored a 3-2 win over AS Roma in the Italian capital to take a firm grip on the last 16 tie. Simone Perrotta put Roma ahead but then Brazilian trio Jadson, Douglas Costa and Luiz Adriano all scored for Shakhtar in a 12-minute spell. Jeremy Menez's second half goal gave Roma some late hope for the return tie, but they were jeered off by their fans. ""Roma live under great pressure, I don't understand the fans' jeers, it's tough to play under these conditions,"" Shakhtar's Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu told AFP.","Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 at the Emirates in Champions League last 16 tie .

"Hollywood, California (CNN) -- Larry King, America's interviewer-in-chief, ended his record-setting career as CNN's prime-time, talk-show host Thursday night with a serenade from Tony Bennett, a greeting from President Obama and a ""Larry King Day"" proclamation from California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Those guests and others capped his 25-year run behind the microphone with CNN. ""Welcome to the last 'Larry King Live.' It's hard to say that,"" King said in his opening remarks to his last show. He was joined on the set by comedian Bill Maher and television host Ryan Seacrest. On several occasions, King stifled tears, especially when Maher put King in the same company as TV legends Johnny Carson, Steve Allen and Walter Cronkite. ""This is not Larry's funeral,"" Maher interjected early in the show. ""Larry is hopefully going to be in our living rooms for years to come. This is the end of a show, not the end of a man."" King wore his signature suspenders -- a pair of red ones with a red-and-white polka-dot tie over a black shirt. At end of his hourlong broadcast, King became choked up with his final sentences. ""It's not very often in my life that I've been without words,"" King said. He thanked his staff and producers. ""When I started 25 years ago in a little studio in Washington, D.C., I never thought it would last this long or come to this,"" King said. ""I'm going to do specials on CNN and do radio work ... so you're not going to see me go away, but you're not going to see me on this set any more. ""I don't know what to say, except to you my audience, thank you. And instead of goodbye, how about so long?"" King concluded. His set then went black -- except for a spotlight illuminating his chrome microphone. In his overall 53 years in broadcasting, King amassed 50,000 interviews, 6,120 shows in CNN's archives, 10 Cable ACE Awards, an Emmy, a Peabody and an entry in the Guinness World Records for having the longest-running show with the same host in the same time slot. Among the guests on the last show was Schwarzenegger, who appeared by a satellite transmission from the capital of Sacramento. The governor extended congratulations and displayed the written proclamation declaring Thursday as belonging to King. ""Thank you,"" King said, adding this quip: ""and keep this in mind: I'll be back."" King will be working on special projects for CNN. In a pre-recorded videotaped message, President Obama called King ""one of the giants in broadcasting."" ""You say all that you do is ask questions, but for generations of Americans, the answers to those questions have surprised us and they have informed us,"" Obama said. From a studio in New York, talk show host Regis Philbin tried to engage King in a song, but King was caught off guard. ""I lost the $500 question,"" King joked. Joining Philbin in New York was Donald Trump. ""You shouldn't be leaving anything, Larry,"" Trump said. ""Nobody ever did it better."" Also in New York was comic Fred Armisen, who dressed up exactly like King and then started interviewing him. ""Now Larry,"" Armisen said, ""what has been my favorite interview?"" King: ""You know you've done so many, it's hard to pick one out."" Armisen: ""Larry, what is the most interesting thing about me."" King: ""The most interesting about you is you're a little whacko."" Armisen: ""What question have you asked more than any?"" King: ""Why. You see the best question of all, Lar, is why. Because it can't be answered in one word and it forces the person to think."" Armisen: ""Besides holding up my pants, why do I wear suspenders?"" King: ""I will not stop wearing them. No matter what I do in life, the suspenders will remain."" News anchors Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer, and Brian Williams joined talk show host Barbara Walters in extending farewells. They were also telecasted from a set in New York. ""We are your protégés, your groupies,"" Sawyer said, giving King a pair of suspenders embroidered with the four guests' and King's names. ""All of us have done heads of state"" interviews, Walters said. ""No one has done more than you."" After King moved the conversation to Williams, Williams remarked: ""You've just done what scores of network executives have been unable to do. You just snatched airtime from Barbara Walters."" Couric read from a poem she wrote for King, in which one verse went: . ""You made NAFTA exciting and that's hard to do. ""And you scored the Paris Hilton post-jail interview,"" Couric recited. Former president Bill Clinton, who just returned from a visit to Haiti and was in Little Rock, Arkansas, said he admired King's work ethic. Clinton had appeared 28 times on King's show. ""I'm like you,"" Clinton said in a live feed from Arkansas. ""I have to keep working. I don't know if it keeps me young, but it keeps me out of the grave."" Seacrest read from a letter written to King from the Rev. Billy Graham, who wrote: ""You will be greatly missed in my evening routine."" Talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw joined the Hollywood set toward the end of the show and asked King how he felt. King turned the question on McGraw: ""How am I doing?"" ""With grace,"" McGraw said. ""You never like to be the center of attention,"" McGraw later said. ""You ask short questions."" Turning to Seacrest and Maher, he added: ""He told me years ago, if it's more than 2 sentences, it's too long."" King was then joined by his wife, Shawn, and two sons, Chance, 11, and Cannon, 10, to hear Tony Bennett sing ""Best is Yet to Come"" from Lake Charles, Louisiana. ""How about them apples,"" King said afterwards. ""Thanks for all the great interviews you've given us, Larry,"" Bennett said. Chance said he looked forward to seeing more of his father. Cannon then stole the show momentarily with an uncanny impersonation of his father, as if he were talking to him and then his mother: . ""Get in the car. I'm too old for this. I've done this for 50 years,"" Cannon said, with an entertaining imitation of King's gravelly voice. ""Stop doing your makeup. This is the last show. We're going to be late."" When King ended his last show and the airtime moved on to Anderson Cooper for his show, the anchor summarized: ""a remarkable moment and a remarkable man.""","Larry King amassed 6,120 shows in CNN's archives over 25 years .
He fought back tears several times and ended his show with ""instead of a goodbye, how about so long""
King will next work on special projects for CNN ."
"(CNN Student News) -- April 8, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan • Thailand • North Korea • Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Bringing you 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines from across the U.S. and around the world. I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now! First Up: Coal Mine . AZUZ: ""The rescue teams are prepared. They're charged up and ready to go."" That is what the governor of West Virginia said yesterday as efforts got going to reach miners trapped by an explosion. The plan was to drill multiple holes down into the mine to help clear out dangerous gases. But later in the day, an official said that samples taken from inside the mine showed that those gas levels were still too dangerous to allow rescuers to go inside. 31 people were working in the Upper Big Branch South Mine when Monday's blast happened. At least 25 were killed; two were hospitalized; the other four may still be trapped. This is, of course, a developing story. To get the latest details on it, head over to CNN.com. Hurricane Prediction . AZUZ: Well, the predictions are in for this year's Atlantic hurricane season, and the forecast: above average. The season starts on June 1st, lasts through the end of November. Here's a look at the prediction for this year versus an average year. Storms are assigned a name when they reach a certain intensity. Experts are forecasting that we'll have 15 named storms. A typical season has 11. Of those 15, the prediction is that 8 will turn into hurricanes, and four of those will become major hurricanes. An average year has six hurricanes, including two major storms. Now, the people who make these predictions point out they are just preliminary. Another one is scheduled to come out on June 2nd. Budget Crisis . AZUZ: Over on the west coast of the country, the city of Los Angeles is facing a major budget problem. In fact, one official called it the most urgent financial crisis in the city's recent history. L.A.'s mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, has an idea to help. ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA, LOS ANGELES MAYOR: I'm asking the CAO to develop a plan to shut down all general-funded city services, with the exception of public safety and revenue-generating positions, for two days per week beginning the week of April 12th. AZUZ: That means this plan could go into effect on Monday. The mayor said there are no simple ways to solve the budget crisis. But he added, ""we can no longer wait. We must act now."" As you might guess, some people are opposed to the mayor's plan, including a company that represents thousands of city employees. It says the plan would threaten services and people's lives. In its current financial situation, Los Angeles is facing a possible $10 million deficit by the start of May. I.D. Me . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a country that's located in Central Asia. I was part of the former Soviet Union, but I gained my independence in 1991. My capital city is Bishkek, and most of my people speak Kyrgyz. I'm Kyrgyzstan, and I'm home to nearly 5.5 million people. Kyrgyzstan Protests . AZUZ: Some of you might not have heard of Kyrgyzstan. The country is an ally of the United States. In fact, the U.S. has a military base there that's an important part of getting supplies to Afghanistan. That's part of the reason why the U.S. is paying attention to what's going on in Kyrgyzstan right now: protests against the government. They're taking place all across the central Asian country, and some of them have turned violent. You can see one in this video that was posted on YouTube. The government has declared a state of emergency. According to reports, fighting between demonstrators and police in the capital city of Bishkek caused at least 40 deaths. Around 400 other people were injured. Kyrgyzstan has experienced a lot of political tension for years. Some of these protesters are pushing for anti-government leaders to be let out of jail. A few have been released and were reportedly going to meet with government officials. Other nations and groups, including the U.S, United Nations and Russia, are urging both sides to settle the situation peacefully. Thailand Protests . AZUZ: A somewhat similar situation is happening southeast of there in Thailand, where protesters are speaking out against that country's government. These demonstrations have been going on for weeks. The country's prime minister declared a state of emergency there yesterday, sent a helicopter to pick up some officials after protesters broke into Thailand's parliament building. They stayed there for a few hours and then regrouped at their usual meeting spots. The demonstrators -- they're called ""Red Shirts"" -- they're supporters of Thailand's former prime minister. He was removed from office in 2006 and left the country in 2008 while he was facing corruption charges. The Red Shirts want him back, and they want the current prime minister to call for elections. The country's leader says these protests are a violation of Thailand's constitution. Sentenced . AZUZ: North Korea has sentenced an American citizen to eight years of hard labor for entering North Korea illegally. Back in January, Aijalon Mahli Gomes crossed over the border from China to North Korea. That's why he was arrested. Crossing the border without permission is against the law there. The United States doesn't have any official relations with North Korea, but some people are asking the U.S. government to try to get Gomes released. Brazil Flooding . AZUZ: Moving over to South America now, where firefighters in Brazil are trying to rescue victims of this: mudslides and severe flooding caused by heavy rains. Almost a foot of rain fell on Rio de Janeiro in one day. Nearly 300 people had been rescued by Tuesday, but officials said the severe weather had killed more than 100 others, and there are some people who are still trapped. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Dendrology is the study of what? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Trees, B) Caves, C) Teeth or D) Living rooms? You've got three seconds -- GO! A dendrologist studies trees. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Learning the Ropes . AZUZ: The city of New York is on a mission to plant a million trees over the next decade, and some folks your age are helping out. It's not training them for a career in dendrology. But as Richard Roth explains, the potential benefits of taking part in the program could help these teens branch out in the future. (BEGIN VIDEO) RICHARD ROTH, CNN UNITED NATIONS CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK: Bronx teenager Fabian Vasquez comes home after a day of hanging with his friends. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Headache! Headache! ROTH: They were hanging sixty feet in the air. It's all part of New York City's Million Trees Training Program. ADRIAN BENEPE, NYC PARKS COMMISSIONER: It's an effort to take kids known as disconnected youth, connect them with employment possibilities, connect them with the environment. So in essence, it's a combination environmental program and jobs program. ROTH: More than thirty young adults participate, learning urban forestry and nature restoration. New York City branching out with with non-profit groups and agencies for funding and instructors. MARK CHISHOLM, TREE PROFESSIONAL: My rule of thumb is four times whatever this diameter is, is what you want. ROTH: Fabian is learning the ropes from a world champion climber and tree professional. CHISHOLM: When you start dealing with the trees, you gotta know species of trees, how to identify hazards in a tree, determine whether it's safe to climb at all or work in, what the tree may need. There's just so many different avenues that they have to become proficient at, that I find that most people really enjoy the fact that they never get bored with it. ROTH: And while tree climbing is physically demanding, it's the mental and emotional challenges that initially need to be overcome. BESHION BAILEY, MILLION TREES TRAINEE: I was scared, I was scared. I told them I couldn't do it. That's the one thing they kept on saying: ""Stop saying you couldnt, stop saying you couldn't, you can."" And that's what they did, is take me out of my comfort zone. And look at me now, going up, how much, eighty, ninety feet. ROTH: They have to stay alert on the streets of New York, and especially ninety feet up. FABIAN VASQUEZ, MILLION TREES TRAINEE: Limb walking, especially right now with this weather, it's kind of windy and stuff, you be limb walking on a limb and it would be shaking and stuff. It is really easy to fall, so you have to be careful where you put your foot at. Any slip, you could just fall so, you always have to be concentrating on what you are doing. You can't be thinking about the stuff outside work. To do this, you always got to keep your mind on this. Everything else is just going to mess you up. ROTH: But does a city known for its asphalt jungle need to train its citizens for green jobs? BRIAN AUCOIN, NEW YORK PARKS DEPARTMENT: Our city parks department manages nearly 30,000 acres of parkland. 12,000 of those acres are undeveloped and naturalized. And with our Million Trees initiative, you know, planting a million trees we need a skilled workforce. ROTH: Climbing trees, a first step to rising to the top in a green career.

The mascots are all different kinds of sausage, but this relay links them together. It's kind of nice to see that kind of teamwork. I mean, no one's being a brat. They all deserve a pattie on the back. Of course, all this entertainment is for the fans. They really get into it, especially when the last guy crosses the finish line. Goodbye .

"(CNN) -- Oprah Winfrey will announce on Friday's ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" that she will end her talk show, said a spokesman for Winfrey's Harpo Productions. ""Oprah will be ending her talk show,"" Harpo spokesman Don Halcombe said Thursday. ""She will be speaking about it on tomorrow's live show."" The show will air live from its Chicago, Illinois, studio at 9 a.m. CT (10 a.m. ET), he said. The show will end on September 9, 2011, as its 25th season draws to a close, according to a letter from Harpo Inc. that President Tim Bennett addressed to partners and obtained by CNN affiliate WLS-TV. ""Tomorrow, Oprah will announce live on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" that she has decided to end what is arguably one of the most popular, influential and enduring programs in television history,"" Bennett wrote. Marquee Blog: Oprah to make it official . The show has been the highest-rated talk show for 23 consecutive seasons, according to the Oprah.com site. It is seen by an estimated 42 million viewers a week in the United States and is broadcast to 145 countries. The show had its origins in 1984, when Winfrey moved to Chicago to host WLS-TV's morning talk show, ""AM Chicago,"" which became the No. 1 local talk show. The show surpassed ratings for ""Donahue"" one month after it began, the site said. Within a year, it had expanded to an hour-long format and been renamed ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" It entered national syndication in 1986. In August 2004, Winfrey signed an extension for the show to keep it on the air through 2011. ""I got a call from Oprah, and she told me that she is announcing that next year will be her last year,"" talk show host Ellen DeGeneres told her audience Thursday. ""It will be her 25th year, and she feels like it's time for her to stop. ""I don't think I could be here without her,"" DeGeneres said. ""I think she has blazed a trail. ... She is an amazing woman. She will always be the queen of daytime television. ... She is fantastic, and I love her and I wish her the best. She deserves to rest. She has worked really, really hard."" Over the years, the show has made news on several occasions. In September 2004, for instance, Winfrey began a new season by giving each member of the audience a new car. In May 2005, Tom Cruise caused a sensation when he jumped up and down on Oprah's couch, declaring his love for actress Katie Holmes. Other guests have shared their personal struggles, such as Elizabeth Edwards, wife of former vice presidential candidate John Edwards; performer Whitney Houston and Lisa Niemi, widow of actor Patrick Swayze. Read Harpo's letter to partners obtained by CNN affiliate WLS . The show has also served as a launching pad for several experts -- Dr. Mehmet Oz on nutrition and health; Suze Orman on financial matters; Dr. Phil McGraw on families and relationships; and Martha Beck, a life coach. McGraw went on to have a talk show of his own. Along the way,  Winfrey has revealed her struggles with weight loss and as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. From the talk show, she has created the popular Oprah's Book Club; O Magazine; Oprah's Angel Network, a charitable foundation; and co-founded Oxygen Media, a 24-hour cable channel aimed at women. Check out Oprah's Book Club web event on CNN . In 2008, Winfrey announced that beginning in 2009, the Discovery Health Channel would be named OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network. The network is ""a multi-platform media company designed to entertain, inform and inspire people to live their best lives,"" according to Oprah.com. Harpo Productions has also grown to include Harpo Films. Winfrey's wealth was estimated at around $1 billion by Forbes in 2004. Last year, she topped the Forbes Celebrity 100 list that measures both power and money.","Oprah Winfrey to announce she'll end show in 2011 during a live broadcast Friday .

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Two hostages freed by a Colombian rebel group reunited with their family members in the country's capital Friday. Speaking to reporters, one of the freed hostages called for renewed dialogue between the government and insurgents. ""Humanitarian exchange is the first step toward a friendly understanding, which permits the return of our brothers deprived of their liberty,"" politician Armando Acuna said shortly after he was released by the FARC leftist guerrilla group Friday. Marine Henry Lopez Martinez was also released Friday and met family members at an airport in the country's capital. ""This is the most beautiful moment of the liberations, the loving reuniting of the families. For this, all the effort is worth it,"" former Sen. Piedad Cordoba, who helped coordinate the humanitarian mission to free them, said in a Twitter post. Acuna and Lopez are among a group of five hostages that the FARC leftist guerrilla organization pledged to release in December. Red Cross rescuers also participated in Friday's mission. Helicopters bearing the organization's symbol flew into the jungle Wednesday to free the first of the group: a councilman from the town of San Jose de Guaviare. Two other hostages -- a police major and a military service member -- are expected to be released Sunday. Some have suggested the hostage releases could fuel renewed dialogue between Colombia's government and the rebels. But news of two more kidnappings by the FARC drew the ire of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. The president said Thursday that he was tempted to call off the rescue mission after learning that two workers from the Carton de Colombia company had been kidnapped in southwestern Colombia Wednesday night. ""We are not going to suspend the liberations, because I do not want to frustrate the excitement and hope of the families of these hostages that are going to be freed, but what I want to say is that this game, this double standard, is totally unacceptable,"" he said. The FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia, have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. Journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.","The hostages released Friday are a politician and a marine .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Uganda's incumbent leader appeared destined Saturday to extend his 25 years in office but as results trickled in, the opposition front-runner charged fraud in the East African nation's presidential election. President Yoweri Museveni, who has led Uganda since a rebel group he was aligned with seized power in 1986, won 71% with a fifth of the votes counted. Challenger Kizza Besigye had 22%. ""There have been widespread malpractices in the electoral process,"" Besigye said. He said voters had been bribed and that ""huge amounts of money"" landed in the hands of polling agents and candidates to pay off electoral officials. ""Local council officials and security agents have been threatening people with war if Museveni does not win this election, and the purpose can only have been to intimidate and threaten the Ugandan people so that they were scared to express their desire for change,"" Besigye, who heads the Inter-Party Cooperation. The government has dismissed the accusations and said the opposition is trying to undermine the election. A new term would give Museveni five more years in power. Final results will be released Sunday. Museveni has already vowed to quash any Egypt-inspired uprisings aimed at toppling entrenched regimes. Ugandans lined up early to cast their ballots amid heavy security in the capital and other areas. Increased security forces in anti-riot gear patrolled the streets of Kampala a day after the elections. Besigye -- who was a former doctor for Museveni -- lost presidential bids in 2001 and 2006. His party said it had anticipated rigging this year, and it plans to conduct its own tally. ""We cannot trust an electoral commission that was appointed by the ruling party. We have to have our own check mechanism,"" said Margaret Wokuri, a spokeswoman for Bisyegi's party. Museveni was once hailed for stabilizing Uganda and helping combat the AIDS epidemic, but has faced mounting criticism over corruption and lack of political transition in the country. Parliament removed presidential term limits in Uganda five years ago, essentially allowing the incumbent to run for office indefinitely. About 14 million people registered to vote in the presidential and parliamentary ballot. There are a total of eight presidential candidates, Wokuri said. Journalist Tom Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: The opposition front-runner says voters and polling officials were bribed .

"(CNN) -- Liz Lee is not your typical MTV reality show star. As friend Jake Fogelnest puts it, ""While (the ""Jersey Shore"" cast) is out fist-pumping, Liz is in her dorm room watching Netflix."" Lee's show, ""My Life as Liz,"" chronicled the self-described nerd's senior year of high school in Texas during its first season last year. Its second season, centering around Lee's time in college in New York, premiered February 8 at 11 p.m. ET, with an 89% increase in viewership from the series premiere, according to MTV. ""The executives at MTV are really smart. The fact that a show like that is on now is amazing and great,"" said Fogelnest, who hosted his own show on MTV as a teenager (from his bedroom, no less), ""Squirt TV,"" in the mid-1990s. ""My Life as Liz"" is ""the one thing where someone's not pregnant or drunk; it's what real people are like."" The show has quickly amassed a big following on Twitter -- not just the hundreds of thousands who follow Lee and her co-stars, but in Twitter feeds like ""@thelizalliance."" More than 1.8 million people have viewed a clip of the most memorable moment from the show on Youtube, in which a nervous Lee stepped in front of a microphone at a talent show and blew everyone away with her singing. Like many MTV reality shows, it's not without its share of controversy. Its detractors have criticized its level of ""reality."" For the record, Lee told CNN, ""The people, the places, they're all real. All the people on the show, I actually know them, and we actually have relationships."" MTV also told the Los Angeles Times last year that neither the terms ""reality show"" nor ""sitcom"" fully captured the show. But ""My Life as Liz"" is unique for another criticism that has been leveled against the show's star: ""My nerd cred is attacked all the time. People think that that was fabricated by MTV. That's the hardest rumor for me to deal with."" During its first season, one anonymous message board posting, especially, claimed that Lee fell in with her school's geeky crowd as a way to remain ""cool"" after losing favor with the popular students, and even alleged that she didn't know who Luke Skywalker was. ""When people (online) say, 'You're not a real nerd,' "" said Lee, ""I'm sitting in my room with shelves overflowing with stacks of comic books."" Benjamin Nugent, author of ""American Nerd,"" noted, ""When you have people choosing to be nerds, questions of authenticity can come up. Before, you had no choice to be a nerd. Now that it's an acceptable option, you can accuse someone of being that way just to be cool. When it was uncool, you never had to worry about authenticity."" As a reflection of the rest of pop culture, something it has captured for nearly 30 years, MTV has embraced geeks in a big way (the sitcom ""The Hard Times of RJ Berger"" will start its second season soon, and there's even a site called ""MTV Geek"" now). In fact, even though MTV means ""Jersey Shore,"" ""Teen Mom"" or ""The Real World"" to most, it has had its moments over the years of standing up for nerds (""Squirt TV"" among them). ""Liz"" something of a sister show to ""The Paper."" The show evolved from what would have been a second season of that show, which had focused on journalism geek Amanda Lorber. It's also a cousin to ""Made,"" MTV's long-running series where someone, usually someone who is socially awkward, gets coached into improving something in their life, whether it be working up the nerve to ask out their crush or becoming an athlete or a hip hop dancer. The network's best known example of a nerd -- a fellow nerd girl, no less -- is ""Daria,"" the animated spinoff of ""Beavis and Butt-Head,"" which started in 1997 and lasted for five seasons. Lee herself sees Daria as an inspiration. ""Daria made it cool to be a smart chick,"" said writer Jennifer Vineyard, who worked at MTV for eight years. ""Just the presence of people or characters like Daria help make it cool to be yourself. There's a tendency for young girls to play dumb. Characters like Daria show you that you don't have to."" MTV's dabbling in nerd culture goes back even further, however. Adam Curry was a VJ for the network for seven years as it made its transition away from only playing music videos. Around the time he started in the late 1980s, Toby Radloff was a special correspondent for the network. Those who have seen the movie ""American Splendor,"" or read the comic book it was based on, might remember Radloff having adopted the title ""genuine nerd."" ""He was completely real,"" said Curry. ""It was just something completely weird and different, that in a way it made so much sense to use him."" Curry, who considers himself a geek -- he registered the MTV.com domain before most people knew what such a thing even meant, then went on to become an early adopter to podcasts -- sees ""My Life as Liz"" as similar to other reality shows. ""The objective gives the viewer the illusion that they can be famous. 'Hey, it's OK to be a nerd, you can be famous. You're a pregnant teenager? Hey, you can be famous.' Nerd culture has exploded because nerds can be successful."" Then there's the show that introduced ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" to the world, ""Liquid Television,"" an anthology of experimental animation that aired in the 1990s that appealed to animation buffs. ""MTV has always experimented with alternative forms of programming,"" said Curry. ""I believe they were running 'Monty Python' in ('Liquid Television's') slot. Here's something different and irreverent, and the rights were cheap. When Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-Head' creator) came on the scene, it was pure genius at the time."" MTV recently announced that ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" are returning to the network in some form: Can ""Daria"" be far behind? Two other memorable shows that were launched off the success of ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" in the 1990s were ""Aeon Flux"" and ""The Maxx,"" both series with tremendous appeal among hardcore comic book and animation fans. ""'The Maxx' was one of the best comic book adaptations ever made. All of that kind of stuff has been a great part of MTV's history,"" said Rick Marshall, editor of MTV's Splash Page, a blog devoted to comic books and comic book adaptations. Marshall has been in charge of the blog nearly from its inception almost 2½ years ago. ""What's been amazing has been the ability to give comic books and creators the same level of promotion and attention that you do the actors and directors,"" he said. In just these last couple of years, Marshall has seen a change in the way comic books have been accepted. ""I can actually have conversations with significantly more people about 'Green Lantern' and people will actually know what I'm talking about,"" he said. ""I love that I can go on the subway, and people are reading 'The Walking Dead.'"" Marshall said that the success of Splash Page shows that ""this audience is actually important,"" and he sees MTV having recognized that as well with ""My Life as Liz."" ""(MTV was) able to take fan culture and market a show specifically to it,"" said Nugent. ""If you tap into the market of people at fan conventions, they're really loyal to an entertainment product when you market it to them."" Nugent also pointed out, ""Because it's now being put on MTV, teenagers are seeing it as more acceptable.

"(CNN)  -- Caroline Wozniacki moved a win nearer to reclaiming the world number one spot from Kim Clijsters but her passage to the last 16 in Dubai only came after her Russian opponent, Anna Chakvetadze, fainted on court. Chakvetadze was serving to level their match at one set all when she collapsed and fell to the ground. Wozniacki and courtside officials all rushed to help Chakvetadze, who eventually came around but played just one more point before wisely retiring. Wozniacki, who took the first set 6-1 but trailed 3-5 in the second, was shocked by the incident. ""It was scary. She is a good friend of mine, but to see anyone collapse on the other side of the net is not a good sight. It was quite a surprise,"" she told AFP. Chakvetadze, who put out Pattaya Open winner Daniela Hantuchova in the first round, was later diagnosed with a gastro-intestinal illness. Wozniacki, who needs to reach the semifinals in Dubai to dislodge Australian Open champion Clijsters, next plays Ayumi Morita as the Japanese qualifier continued her superb run. Morita beat Clijsters' Paris final conqueror Petra Kvitova in the first round and followed that up Wednesday with a straight sets win over Sania Mirza, the Indian star now based in Dubai. Morita eased to a 6-4 6-2 win while Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova earned another meeting with Francesca Schiavone of Italy. Kuznetsova lost to the French Open winner in the longest women's match in grand slam history in last month's Australian Open, four hours 44 minutes. Kuznetsova needed two-hours 30 minutes to beat Tavetona Pironkova by 5-7 6-2 6-3 to earn a chance of revenge. ""I think every single person who knows me watch that match in Melbourne came to me and said it was a great match,"" Kuznetsova said. Meanwhile, Britain's Andy Murray has withdrawn from next week's ATP tournament in Dubai, citing a wrist injury. Murray, beaten in the final of the Australian Open by Novak Djokovic, played last week in Rotterdam, but was well below his best and won only five games in losing his first-round clash to Marcos Baghdatis. His withdrawal will mean the 23-year-old is not due to play again until the Masters Series event in Indian Wells in the middle of next month. ""Andy would like to apologize to both the tournament and its fans,"" he told his official website. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are among the entries for the popular tournament.","Caroline Wozniacki moves to within two wins of reclaiming world number one spot .

"(CNN) -- The Colombian military says it has seized a submarine capable of transporting more than seven tons of cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. This is the most sophisticated tool ever found to traffic drugs from Colombia, local media reported. In a short news release, the Colombian military said that the submarine was ready to be loaded with drugs when found in Timbiqui, Cauca, a small town in the Pacific Coast. According to the local authorities, the submarine is 31 meters (102 feet) long and capable of submerging to a depth of 9 meters (about 30 feet) making it very difficult to locate. This is the first time such a vessel for this purpose has been found in the country. Mexican authorities seized a similar submarine in 2008. Then, experts said the technology used to build it was of Russian origin.","Military: Vessel was capable of transporting more than 7 tons of cocaine .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Security forces in northern Iraq found a mass grave containing scores of people killed during the height of sectarian violence last decade, police told CNN on Saturday. At least 153 bodies were discovered in Buhriz, just south of Baquba in Diyala province -- a region north and east of Baghdad that endured waves of violence during the Iraqi war. Baquba police Lt. Col. Ghalib Atiya al-Jabouri said the victims included civilians, police and soldiers slain during the height of sectarian violence between 2005 and 2008. Iraq had been engulfed by fighting between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. Buhriz, he said, had been controlled by al Qaeda in Iraq between 2006 and 2008. Some victims were blindfolded and others had their hands tied behind their backs, signs of al Qaeda in Iraq activity. The Iraqi Red Crescent has registered thousands of missing persons in Iraq since just after the war started.","At least 153 corpses were found .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rapid advances in communications are eroding police departments' abilities to conduct wiretaps, and Congress needs to take steps to ensure that new telephone, computer and wireless systems are designed to allow lawful police access, FBI and police officials told Congress Thursday. But other witnesses cautioned that any such move could stifle innovation, place U.S. technology companies at a competitive disadvantage and unintentionally create systems vulnerable to hackers, criminals and terrorists. At issue is the diminished capability of law enforcement agencies to conduct quick wiretaps in an age of Twitter accounts, Facebook and MySpace pages, BlackBerrys, Androids, iPhones and iPads. The Justice Department calls the phenomenon ""going dark."" In testimony before a House Judiciary subcommittee, FBI General Counsel Valerie Caproni said it is ""exponentially more difficult"" to execute court-authorized wiretaps on new technology, noting that criminals can now communicate using wireless devices and anonymous avatars. Caproni said the FBI is not seeking additional authority to conduct wiretaps, but rather is looking for solutions to technical problems the agency encounters in conducting court-authorized intercepts. The Obama administration currently has no proposal to increase the technological ease of wiretapping, she said, but she added that one may be coming soon. A 1994 law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, required telephone companies to build in the means to conduct intercepts. But the law was designed to keep pace with changes in telecommunications, not in internet-based communications services, and is now antiquated, she said. As an example, Caproni cites a 2009 case in which a pimp used a social networking site to entice children into prostitution. Investigators had enough evidence for a court-ordered wiretap, but did not seek one because the website did not provide a means of conducting electronic surveillance, she wrote. ""There are a lot of things that keep me up at night. One thing is the privacy of people who are communicating on the Internet,"" Caproni said. ""But I also get kept up by worrying that we've got criminals running around that we can't arrest and can't prosecute because we can't actually execute a wiretap order. And that criminal may be a massive drug dealer. They may be an arms trafficker. They may be a child pornographer or a child molester. ""I worry about things like a Mumbai-style attack where, God forbid, the attackers are using communications modalities that we don't have an interception (for)."" But another witness told the committee moves to change technology come with risks of their own. ""Switches"" designed to give police wiretapping capabilities were hacked in Greece, leading to the unlawful wiretapping of 100 senior government officials for 10 months, and a system was breached in Italy, allowing unlawful wiretaps of 6,000 Italians, said Susan Landau of Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Another concern is stifling innovation. ""The person in the dorm room building the next great app may never build it if they have to comply with a government imposed mandate,"" said Greg Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology. ""They might not even think about building the next great application. And if they did they might have to re-architect it in a way that would be less efficient, less useful to users than it would have been if they had been able to build according to what they wanted to do."" Nojeim also takes issue with the idea that the law enforcement is ""going dark."" ""Wiretapping is at record levels,"" he said. ""There were more wiretaps placed in 2009 by federal and state officials than ever in history. For each of the thousands of wiretaps that are placed, over 3,000 communications are intercepted. That's not an FBI going dark. That's an awful lot of light."" CNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","New technology is giving suspects the edge over authorities, an FBI official says .

"(CNN) -- Philippine seismologists issued an alert on Mount Bulusan Sunday after the Luzon Island volcano erupted twice during a 24-hour period, according to a bulletin released by the nation's volcano-monitoring agency. However, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOCS) said the eruptions posed little threat to the villages surrounding the Luzon Island volcano. Most of the villages lie outside the 4-kilometer (2 1/2-mile) danger zone, the bulletin stated. Philippine volcanologists, according to the agency, aren't expecting Mount Bulusan to erupt again soon. The volcano is located about 249 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of Manila. The area immediately surrounding the Bulusan Volcano is mostly rural. There are several villages, but most are outside the danger zone, according to PHILVOCS. The most recent eruption, which took place before dawn local time on Sunday lasted about 20 minutes, according to the agency. In declaring an ""Alert Level 1,"" the agency warned nearby residents not to enter the 4-kilometer ""permanent danger zone"" because of possible steam and ash explosions. Area residents were also warned of the possibility of flooding if heavy rains push sediment-filled streams out of their banks.","Philippine seismologists declare Alert Level 1 for Mount Bulusan volcano .

"(CNN) -- Public safety officials in Texas Thursday released a video of a man throwing a Molotov cocktail at the governor's mansion in 2008, hoping it and a suspect sketch will lead to his identification. The Department of Public Safety and its Texas Rangers division are offering a $50,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the arson. ""We're quite confident someone knows who this suspect is,"" Steven McCraw, director of public safety, said at a press conference. Authorities, who say the thrower is the same person shown in another video at a rear gate outside the mansion, hope a relative or acquaintance will recognize his appearance, gait or run. They also released video of a white Jeep Cherokee whose occupants were taking photos of the mansion four days before the June 8, 2008, fire in Austin. The vehicle owner and two other occupants in the Jeep are called ""persons of interest"" in the case. Investigators said they have established a direct link between the three and an Austin-based anarchist group linked to a planned attack on the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis in September 2008, which also involved Molotov cocktails. The person throwing the fire device at the mansion is not believed to be one of the three people in the vehicle, officials said. ""We need somebody's help in linking these people together, said Ranger Capt. Antonio Leal. Officials studied 1,900 hours of video taken by 11 cameras at or near the house that has served as the official residence of Texas governors and their families since 1856. Gov. Rick Perry was not living in the mansion at the time of the fire because it was undergoing repairs. According to an accompanying statement, the three persons of interest have denied involvement in the fire. ""One passenger initially denied having been in the vehicle, but later admitted to having been in the vehicle and taking photographs after failing a polygraph examination,"" according to the statement. At least one of the persons of interest has been placed in the downtown area the morning of the mansion fire, officials said. White authorities call the three persons of interest and know their identifies, McGraw said he will not identify the Jeep occupants until the department has enough evidence to prosecute them. The Texas fire and the planned attack in Minneapolis involved Molotov cocktails, he said.

"(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator and father of four children adopted from Florida's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest-control truck he was driving is one of them -- his 10-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday. Jorge Barahona, 53, already faces a charge of aggravated child abuse for injuries to the dead girl's twin, Victor, who was also found in the truck, which was parked on the side of I-95 near West Palm Beach, Florida, officials said. According to a probable-cause affidavit filed by the West Palm Beach Police Department, a roadside assistance ranger with the Florida Department of Transportation stopped to check the red Toyota pickup Monday around 5:30 a.m. and found the 10-year-old boy inside next to an open gas can. The boy ""appeared to be in respiratory distress and (was) trembling"" and his clothing ""was soaked with an unknown chemical,"" the affidavit said. The ranger then found Barahona on the ground beside the truck and called for help. The boy was hospitalized in intensive care with severe burns to his abdomen, upper thighs and buttocks, the affidavit said.  While examining the boy, doctors noted he had sustained previous injuries, including a broken collarbone, a broken arm, scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen, and ligature marks on both wrists, police said. After Barahona and his son were taken to a hospital, a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl, wrapped in a plastic bag, the document said. Barahona told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter, and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire, the affidavit said.  Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added. ""Basically, to paraphrase, he was stating that he placed his daughter in a plastic bag being distraught over her death,"" West Palm Beach Police Spokesman Chase Scott told reporters. ""He drove here from South Florida accompanied by his son, Victor. He then pulled off to the side of the road saying that he poured gas on his self, intending to light himself on fire. His son's head was in his lap and he decided, after giving his son some sleeping pills, that he wasn't going to do that."" Barahona told police that he doused himself with gasoline and inadvertently got some on the boy, Police Capt. Mary Olsen said. But, she added, the man's story doesn't add up -- there was no gasoline on the boy. Instead, he was covered with another chemical whose composition had yet to be determined. ""That's why we're still treating this as a hazmat (hazardous materials case),"" she said. Scott said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well, he said. Victor, who was transferred Wednesday morning to a specialized burn unit at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, has not been able to talk to investigators because he is on a breathing tube, she said. Olsen said police would decide how to charge Barahona further once the autopsy on his daughter determines her cause of death. Asked whether Barahona has expressed remorse, she said, ""He feels remorse, but we're not getting consistent statements with what we're seeing in our evidence."" She added, ""It's a complex case."" At a hearing Wednesday in Miami attended by Barahona's wife, Carmen, a judge ordered that the remaining two children in the home be placed in foster care. Florida's Department of Children and Families had opened a child protection investigation within the past few days to look into a complaint involving the Barahona family, and it wasn't the first such complaint, spokesman Mark Riordan said. Reporters in the courtroom Wednesday heard tales of abuse, mainly concerning the twins, from state officials and experts.  The caller to the child protection hotline in the latest case reported that the twins were routinely locked in a bathroom for long periods of time and had been bound with tape, the court heard. The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court. An investigator told the court that she had showed up last Friday night at the family's home but had not seen the children. Instead, she said, she had left the family's house after speaking with Carmen Barahona, planning to return on Monday. Asked why she had not planned to return sooner, she said, ""I'm not allowed to do investigations on a weekend."" However, a spokesman for the department, John Harrell, said it is the job of investigators to follow through immediately or refer to someone else in the department to follow through when a matter is urgent.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Indian sports officials have downplayed fire-safety concerns at the venue for the final match of the 2011 Cricket World Cup in Mumbai, promising full compliance well before the April 2 event. Lalchand Rajput, joint secretary of Mumbai's cricket association, told CNN on Friday that fire inspectors visited the city's Wankhede Stadium two days ago. He acknowledged they did offer suggested improvements to follow. ""We are working on them. There will be full compliance,"" Rajput said. Rajput insisted the venue had already been given a no-objection clearance by Mumbai authorities. He said he was confident the stadium would also get a fire-compliance certificate. Indian officials will hope the Mumbai venue does not have the same problems as Kolkata's Eden Gardens, which was stripped of a World Cup match after it failed an inspection by the International Cricket Council due to a delay in construction work. The iconic stadium will still host three games next month. India is co-hosting the four-yearly tournament along with sub-continent neighbors Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, with the opening match taking place in Dhaka on Saturday. Wankhede Stadium will stage two Group A matches next month, with New Zealand playing Canada on March 13 and the Kiwis again facing Sri Lanka five days later. The tournament features 14 nations, spread across two round-robin groups, with the top four teams from each qualifying for the quarterfinals. There will be 48 matches played before the final, which will be a day-night match along with all the other knockout ties.","Fire officials visit Mumbai cricket stadium and offer suggestions ahead of World Cup .

"Parker, Colorado (CNN) -- When the sniper's bullet hit his neck, Staff Sgt. Matthew Keil nearly blacked out. ""I had heard the gunshot, and it felt like someone had kicked me right in the back. A ton of bricks swung and hit me in the back, and I fell,"" he said. ""I couldn't feel my body. I could only feel my head, and it felt like I was floating."" He was on a rooftop in Ramadi, Iraq, leading a nine-man squad. His men rushed to his aid, stopped the bleeding and then strapped him to a stretcher to evacuate him. This is when Keil finally closed his eyes. A short time later, a world away, in Colorado, Tracy Keil's phone rang: Her husband had been severely wounded. Tracy Keil was a successful accountant working in corporate America. She didn't know it at the time, but that day, February 24, 2007, was the last day she would ever work a regular job. A much more difficult job and an uncertain future awaited her. Sgt. Keil opened his eyes again three days later at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Tracy was by his side. ""My wife was standing next to the bed, and she said, 'I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. I'll be here as long as you need. You're stuck with me,' "" he recalls. Matthew's legs and right arm were paralyzed, and he had minimal control over his left arm. He would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. This is the point where some spouses call it quits. ""I could have. I watched a lot of wives leave. When we said our vows, I meant every word of it. It didn't matter what physical or mental condition he was in. It just didn't. He was alive, and that's all that mattered,"" Tracy says. Down, but not out, they set about building a new life: Months of physical therapy and rehab, then back to Colorado. It was a lot for any couple to handle, but Tracy, 33, and Matt, 29, were still newlyweds. They had exchanged vows just six weeks to the day before Matt was shot. While most young couples are focused on building careers and starting a family, the Keils were focused on learning to live in their new roles: him as paraplegic, her as caregiver. They were determined to not let the injury define them. They would have a full and productive life, but it would take determination and hard work. ""I think Matt and I were more prepared as a couple for death than for an injury like this,"" Tracy says. ""We had talked about a lot of things, but we have never talked about this."" So they turned to the Department of Veterans Affairs for help. The Keils say the VA has taken good care of Matthew's primary medical concerns, but there was no help for Tracy. She longed for support and to be recognized for her role as Matthew's caregiver. In the Army, Matthew loved the feeling of being part of a team. But the Keils felt abandoned. Then, in May 2010, a new federal law passed that promised to help caretakers like Tracy. Under the law, caregivers would receive a financial stipend, health care, training and -- perhaps most importantly -- respite care.  Trained health care providers would come into the home and give the caretaker a break. Obama signs $3.6 billion veterans caregiver bill . The law was supposed to take effect on January 31, but so far, none of the new benefits have been implemented. The VA says it is unable to provide a timeline for when the benefits will be available, but in a statement, the agency says it's working as quickly as possible. ""VA understands that every day is a challenge for the Caregivers of our most critically injured or ill Veterans. That's why VA is working to move forward with deliberate haste to implement this complex Act. Different benefits will have different implementation timelines based upon the law's requirements and the complexity of the benefit."" During the signing ceremony in May, President Obama hailed the legislation as ""a major step forward in America's commitment to families and caregivers who tend to our wounded warriors every day."" When asked about the delay in implementation, a White House official said ""the President views delays in payments to caregivers as unacceptable. He has directed his team to work through options immediately to get these benefits to the caregivers who need them."" The VA says that the new program is complicated to implement and that it has never before given benefits to nonveterans, so systems must be out into place to determine eligibility and prevent fraud and abuse. The delay has left the Keils felling abandoned once again. Tracy has been forced to give up her career and faces decades of caring for Matt. As much as the benefits, Tracy is looking for recognition for the work she does to help her wounded warrior husband. ""I had a great job, I made good money, we had plans to buy a house and move forward. I had a lot of potential."" She says. ""Now it's like I'm working for the VA for free."" Matt is unable to even get himself out of bed and needs constant care with everything from feeding to using the toilet. For Tracy, it's a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job. ""There are days that I think, 'How am I going to do this for the rest of my life?' "" She says, ""I love him, and I would do anything for him, and that's what gets you though those really, really hard days."" Through their hard work, the Keils have built a new life. A nonprofit group, Homes for Our Troops, built a wheelchair-accessible house for the Keils, and through artificial insemination, the couple's hope of starting a family has come true: Twins Faith and Matthew Jr. were born in November. The babies add even more work for Tracy. Given Matt's injury, some people have told them they have no business having kids. ""I feel like we should be afforded all the same hopes and dreams that everybody else has,"" she says. ""I don't think because he is injured, we should have any less dreams than anyone else."" After four years of dealing with the VA, Tracy Keil says she has developed a reputation as a fighter. It's a part of her role as caretaker that she takes very seriously, but she looks forward to a day when she won't have to waste her valuable energy fighting for their benefits. ""Despite what the VA must think, I don't enjoy fighting with them for every little thing. It would be nice to just be able to just ask for something and them say 'Sure, it's in the regulations, here you go.' That would be wonderful."" She says. ""But the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and I squeak a lot.""","A sniper's bullet in Iraq left Staff Sgt. Matthew Keil paralyzed .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan captain Gennaro Gattuso has been charged for head-butting Tottenham's assistant manager at the end of his side's Champions League loss on Tuesday. Football's European governing body told CNN on Thursday that Gattuso faces a charge of ""gross sporting misconduct"" after he clashed with former Milan player Joe Jordan following the 1-0 first-leg defeat at the San Siro. UEFA said the 33-year-old's case will be discussed at a meeting of its disciplinary and control panel in Switzerland on Monday. The former Italy midfielder was already due to miss the return leg of the last-16 tie at White Hart Lane in March because of an earlier booking during the game, but according to UEFA's rules this could be extended to at least a three-match suspension.

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal will return to Davis Cup action for the first time since 2009 next month, when he leads Spain in its world group first-round clash against Belgium. It will be the first time the 24-year-old has played in the competition since he was part of the Spanish side that beat the Czech Republic in the final two years ago. The tie, which takes place in the Belgian town of Charleroi from March 4-6, will also be Nadal's first competitive match since he sustained a wrist injury in his Australian Open quarterfinal loss to compatriot David Ferrer. The Mallorcan was named in the Spanish squad alongside world number 6 Ferrer, number nine Fernando Verdasco and 41-ranked Feliciano Lopez by team captain Albert Costa at a press conference in Alicante on Friday. ""Having the world number one and best sportsman of 2010 brings a winning spirit and stability to the team,"" Costa told the official ATP Tour website. ""After the small injury he had in Australia he has done what he needed to do to be able to return to training. His training is progressing, and when he joins our training camp he'll be in perfect condition,"" the former world number six added. Nine-time grand slam champion Nadal has an impressive 14-1 win-loss record in Davis Cup singles play and was also part of the team who claimed victory in the event in 2004. He will travel to Belgium on February 27 to prepare with his teammates ahead of the fourth meeting of the two European countries in the event. Meanwhile, United States captain Jim Courier has named number eight Andy Roddick as part of a five-man squad who will face Chile in their first round tie.

But Roddick, 28 -- who is the second best all-time player in U.S. Davis Cup history with 31 singles wins -- now looks likely to make his comeback in the event when the Americans travel to Santiago in March. For his first tie in charge of the U.S., Courier also named John Isner, Sam Querrey and doubles specialists Bob and Mike Bryan. The former world number one can change as many as two players before he must submit his final four-man line up ahead of the draw ceremony on Thursday March 3.","Rafael Nadal is named in Spain's Davis Cup squad by captain Albert Costa .

"(CNN) -- Luci Baines Johnson was just 16 years old when she approached her father, President Johnson, with what she considered a reasonable request. Luci Baines Johnson, left, and her older sister, Lynda Bird, pose inside the White House in 1963. ""I asked my father if we could have the Beatles come to play at the White House,"" she recalled. ""I was very excited about it."" His response? A decisive no, ""without even any moment of trying to soften the blow,"" Johnson said in a recent phone interview. The president thought the move would be viewed as self-serving. His daughter, however, saw it as a chance to honor ""a great talent"" and strengthen ties between the United States and Great Britain -- not to mention a golden opportunity for her and her friends. ""I could see how different sets of folks could have either perspective. And I suspect my father could see that too,"" she said. Luci Baines Johnson learned quickly of the scrutiny that came from being a first daughter. Her family moved into the White House in 1963, following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Johnson was catapulted into the exclusive fraternity of White House families and embraced what she describes as a role she landed simply by chance. That fraternity has most recently expanded to include President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia. ""I was an eyewitness to history, over and over, during my father's five years in the White House. And I wasn't elected to that option. I had no qualifications that provided me that privilege except an accident of birth,"" she said.  See famous first kids who grew up in the White House » . Johnson speaks fondly of the opportunity she was afforded to dine with kings and queens, meet the movers and shakers of her time, engage with the body of America and hold a front-row seat to history. While most of her memories fall into two categories -- ""the fond personal memories"" and ""the fond memories of public privilege"" -- there's one in particular that was a combination of both. ""My 17th birthday, I received a handwritten note from my father, the only handwritten note I have, telling me how much he loves me and how much he has delighted in having me as his daughter for all those 17 years,"" she said. The note was dated noon, July 2, 1964. Six hours later, in the East Room of the White House, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination based on race or gender in public places, schools and places of employment. ""Can you imagine ever receiving a more momentous, glorious, exciting, thrilling birthday present that lasted forever and ever than something like that, that would change the world for all time and make it a much more decent place? That took place on my birthday,"" she said. Life in the White House, however, came at a cost. Johnson and the first children before and after her will always have to ""pay a big price in terms of personal time,"" she said. More than 45 years after she moved into the White House, she still receives requests for interviews about the time she spent there. But the public's interest in first daughters is nothing new. Fanny Hayes, for example, who was about the same age as Malia when she moved into the White House in 1877, was followed by the media until the day she died. ""She was an American celebrity,"" said presidential historian Doug Wead. While the interest in first daughters has stayed steady, the pressure on the children has intensified, said Wead, author of ""All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families."" ""It's like the Miss America contest -- it's a real dilemma for the daughter of a president. She's supposed to be gracious. She's mocked and ridiculed if she isn't pretty,"" he said. When Chelsea Clinton was just 13 years old, for example, she was ridiculed in a 1993 ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch that declared her ""not a babe."" Actor Mike Myers later apologized, and the skit was cut from replays of the show. Amy Carter, who was 9 when she moved into the White House, was also mocked for her appearance and for her poor manners, after she pulled out a book during a state dinner. Her parents enrolled her in public school, illuminating the already bright spotlight on her. An infamous photograph of her first day at school shows the young girl with her head hanging low, carrying a Snoopy book bag and surrounded by a swarm of paparazzi. To this date, no other presidential children have attended public school. But other presidential children have taken on power roles in their fathers' administrations. Anna Roosevelt, for example, was a ""super aide"" to Franklin D. Roosevelt during his last year in office, Wead said, describing her as a combination of a personal secretary and chief of staff, not to mention popular in the public eye. And Alice Roosevelt, a fashion icon who was known to have quite the rebellious streak, also played a pivotal role for her father, Theodore Roosevelt. She went on an around-the-world junket for the purposes of American foreign policy -- a move that diverted attention from her father's efforts to bring about a peace treaty in the Russo-Japanese War, Wead said. The president later won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on various peace treaties. Under the administration that followed, William Taft's daughter became one of the unsung heroes of women's rights, Wead said. Taft credited his daughter, Helen, for helping to change his mind about women's suffrage. But for all presidential children, Wead said, there remains a lifelong battle of seeking approval from their fathers while struggling to carve their own identities. Many presidential daughters have gone on to author books about their time in White House, in what Wead describes as an attempt to restore their fathers' reputations. ""It's like sitting in front of a big window ... and seeing a billboard with misspelled words on it. It's just irritating,"" he said. ""And the writing of a book, if it doesn't change history, it is a purifying experience for the child."" Susan Ford Bales once told the San Francisco Chronicle that while in the White House, ""I kept thinking, I want to be normal. But I can't be normal. .... Everyone was watching. It was like living out loud."" But Ford also cashed in on some of the perks of her high-profile position and took Alice Roosevelt's advice to ""have one hell of a good time."" Ford roller-skated through the White House, held her prom in the East Room and scored VIP treatment at concerts -- including a backstage pass to see Rod Stewart. (That move ignited the public's interest in her, sparking rumors that she and Stewart were engaged.) Johnson said that some of the best advice she received while in the White House was to just recognize that she couldn't change things or make the attention go away. ""There are inevitably going to be moments when you feel like the pressures of the goldfish bowl seem unfair or more than you can bear, but so are the opportunities to learn, to understand, to grow, to love, to make friends, to witness,"" she said. ""I describe it as the best of times and sometimes the worst of times, but whatever the times, it was a time of extraordinary privilege.""","Luci Johnson describes being a first daughter as an ""extraordinary privilege""

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Hurling rocks and brandishing daggers and sticks, supporters of longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh plunged into a crowd calling for his ouster in Sanaa on Friday as rising momentum in Yemen sprouted similar protests in other towns. Reports of excessive force prompted calls for restraint amid intensifying demonstrations. U.S. President Barack Obama voiced concern about what the U.S. Embassy in Yemen described as ""a disturbing rise in the number and violence of attacks against Yemeni citizens gathering peacefully to express their views on the current political situation."" ""The United States condemns the use of violence by governments against peaceful protestors,"" Obama said. ""Wherever they are, people have certain universal rights, including the right of peaceful assembly."" The embassy statement said ""the attacks are contrary to the commitments that President Saleh has made to protect the right of Yemeni citizens to gather peacefully to express their views."" The violence in Yemen and Libya on Friday stood in sharp contrast to images from Cairo's Tahrir Square, where Egyptians showed up en masse to celebrate the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak a week ago. Saleh's foes in Yemen are trying to score their own victory. After midday prayers concluded, they marched from the gates of Sanaa University to the streets, where security forces and riot police tried to stay between rival demonstrators Friday. Some told Amnesty International that they had been surrounded by security forces, aided by ""thugs"" who fired shots at them and beat them. ""We are very scared, particularly because there are children with us,"" a protester told the human rights monitoring group. ""We've tried to get the children out of the area, but the security forces have not allowed us to do so."" ""After Mubarak, now it's Ali's turn,"" chanted the anti-government protesters. ""The people want the fall of the regime."" ""I'm out here today because we want the president to go and we want to make sure that he and his family don't stay in power,"" said Khalid Amer, a student. Despite concessions from Saleh, a tide of anger is sweeping through Yemen's youths, who say they are simply fed up with the status quo. At least 30 anti-government demonstrators were injured, according to Abdul Naser Al-Dumaini, an anti-government protester at a demonstration in Sanaa. The day before, at least 20 people were injured in Sanaa. Opposition lawmaker Ahmed Hashid said police at the scene did not try to intervene. In Taiz, more than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators, including 4,000 women, gathered Friday in Freedom Square in a seventh straight day of protests, witnesses said. An assailant drove by the square and hurled a grenade, killing one person, a police official said. At least 43 others were wounded. And in the coastal city of Aden, about 3,000 anti-government demonstrators gathered in the Al-Mansoura District, witnesses said. Five people have been killed in Aden since Wednesday, hospital and government officials said. Aref al-Qubati, a participant whose friend was one of the victims, said police fired to disperse protesters. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that ""at least four photojournalists were attacked, beaten and had their cameras confiscated"" by government supporters at the protests. The government countered the coverage of discontent in Yemen by reporting on sympathetic demonstrations. The state-run Saba news agency said a million demonstrators had marched in Taiz, hoisting Yemeni flags and pictures of Saleh. And Deputy Interior Minister Hussein al-Zawa'ari blamed a southern secessionist movement for the unrest and deaths in Aden, Saba said. Saleh has called for an investigation into the Aden violence, and Vice President Abdu Rabo Mansour Hadi met with the governor Thursday, Saba said. Saleh, in power for 32 years, met earlier in the week with his National Defense Council to discuss discontent in his nation. The council ""stressed all should practice their rights according to the constitution, in a peaceful way and without violence, chaos, sabotage and lawbreaking,"" Saba said. Saleh has been in touch with King Hamad of Bahrain, which is also mired in unrest. ""He pointed out that there are schemes aimed at plunging the region into chaos and violence targeting the nation's security and the stability of its countries,"" Saba said. ""Those who commit acts of disorder and vandalism (are) simply implementing suspicious foreign agendas ..."" The report didn't suggest who might be behind the agendas. In an attempt to quell growing discontent, Saleh, a U.S. ally in the fight against an offshoot of al Qaeda in Yemen, has announced he won't seek another term in 2013. He also said he would postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for April to allow more time for discussions about reform. Yemen's situation is compounded by the fight against al Qaeda, the southern separatist movement in its once-independent south, a Shiite uprising and a looming shortage of water.","NEW: Obama: U.S. condemns violence ""by governments against peaceful protestors""

"(CNN) -- As one of the most anticipated games of 2011, ""Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds"" (Capcom) doesn't disappoint with new characters, a story line with uber-villain Galactus and a new mode designed to make it easy to get involved in the action. After a 10-year hiatus, the popular fighting game brings the battle zones into the third dimension. While action remains in two dimensions, the characters are generated in 3-D and provide for a more robust visual image of the fighting. Each fight can be one-on-one or tag-team, with three characters on each side. One of the biggest question marks as the game's release neared was who would be in and who would be left off of the Marvel and Capcom casts. Seth Killian, special combat adviser for Capcom, said the company wanted to achieve a balance between Japanese and Western characters. ""We wanted to include the fan faves [from Japan] as well as the key characters from Marvel,"" he said. ""But we also wanted to include some fringe characters that haven't been featured before to appeal to each audience."" Thirty-six characters are playable right away, with two more available as downloadable content. Signature characters like Spider-Man and Ryu make their return, but only comic book fans may recognize some of the other characters. ""We included the Super-Skrull because we couldn't have the Fantastic Four and we wanted to have them represented somehow,"" Killian said. ""We chose Marvel characters that Japanese fans would think were cool."" Killian said each character has unique and special fighting abilities, so one character doesn't feel or act like another. Capcom characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. That structure helped balance out the game and make it fun. ""With so many moves and abilities, it becomes more strategic,"" he said. ""Which characters can I choose to cover up some weaknesses, or do I just play to my strengths? It is up to the player to figure out how to use them."" The fighting system, while criticized in past versions for the complex button mashing and joystick gyrations required to achieve moves, has also been retooled. In an effort to gain fans and reach out to more casual players, the game can be played in simple mode, where only three buttons are needed to attack an opponent. This affords new fans who may be familiar with the characters, but not the game, the ability to get into the action right away. ""We really wanted to make the game easy to get into,"" Killian said. ""Simple mode gives you three attack buttons: light, medium and heavy. There is also one 'hyper combo' and two special attacks. That's it. By contrast, [Capcom character] Dante has 35 different attacks in the normal mode."" A ""mission mode"" helps players learn the normal attacks, if they want to. The missions take characters through different stages where they work on a particular attack to get its sequences right. Using attacks in particular combinations increases the player's power bar, which grants hyper combos and team combos in three-on-three action. Killian said designers added a behind-the-scenes feature called hit-stun scaling that prevents infinite combo loops. ""It took us three years to develop the game, and a lot of that time goes into balance and technical,"" he said. ""We've designed it for the long term and really think fans are going to enjoy how it plays."" Arcade mode is where the story line comes in. Each universe's top bad guy -- Dr. Doom for Marvel and Albert Wesker (from ""Resident Evil"") for Capcom -- decides to join forces to beat the good guys and rule their respective domains. However, as big, evil plans often turn out, their efforts are recognized by someone even more powerful than they are: the world eater Galactus. Galactus decides he wants both worlds, and the heroes and villains from each must unite to defeat him. Teams of three characters each do battle against each other to determine who will be strong enough to take on the galactic titan. Killian said a unique ending sequence plays out for each character after the final battle, and each has alternate uniforms and dialogue that are unique to the character's persona. Nonplayable characters will also make appearances during the story line to add flavor and interest in the mission. Characters also have powers and abilities that come out only during specific times in a battle. For example, Marvel's Phoenix will transform to Dark Phoenix after her life bar runs down. This includes more powerful attacks but costs Dark Phoenix in life points as time goes on. ""Marvel vs. Capcom 3"" doesn't fail to impress. The way difficulty can be scaled down should win over new fans while allowing more advanced fighting players to jump right in. Simple mode took me through the battles quickly and let me get familiar with some of the new abilities and characters. Jumping into mission mode helped me learn moves that I utilized in normal mode and made the action even more vibrant. Capcom also hit the mark with interesting voice and movement additions for each character that really heighten enjoyment of the game. Deadpool's taunting and breaking the fourth wall to speak directly to the player were unexpected and very funny. Sure, some are going to quibble over which characters were included and which were left out. But with 36 to choose from, it will be hard for players to not find a character from either universe they'll enjoy playing. It all works and will provide hours of enjoyment, even after Galactus is defeated. And with more downloadable content promised, we won't have to wait 10 more years to use Hadouken (for the uninitiated, that's a special attack) on new opponents. ""Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds"" is rated T for teens. It was released this week for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles. This review was done with the Xbox 360 version.","""Marvel vs. Capcom,"" the popular fighting game, returns after 10 years .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- For years, small groups of Cuban dissidents have taken their demands to the streets, calling for political freedom as they get pushed around and shouted down by swarms of government supporters. But a recently leaked video suggests the war between the Communist government and its opponents has shifted to a new battlefield: the internet. The video shows what appears to be an official intelligence briefing, in which a lecturer talks about the dangers and possibilities of the web. ""We aren't fighting the new technology,"" he tells his audience, who are dressed in the military uniforms worn by Cuba's Interior Ministry officials. ""We simply have to get to know it and use it in our favor, but also know what the enemy is doing."" The 54-minute video was posted on the video-sharing website Vimeo by someone identified only as ""Coral Negro"" and has since appeared on dozens of blogs, many of them critical of the Cuban government. CNN wasn't able to verify the authenticity of the video. Although it was leaked this month, the video appears to have been recorded last summer, well before the social-media-fueled uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East. But for Cuba¹s dissident bloggers, there are plenty of parallels. Yoani Sanchez followed via Twitter the upheaval in Egypt that ultimately led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak and responded with her own tweets. ""What a great lesson the Egyptians are giving us!"" she wrote. Sanchez has won a huge global audience with her blog ""Generation Y,"" which criticizes the Cuban government and comments on daily hardships. ""There are a lot of similarities with Egypt,"" she told CNN Wednesday. ""The dissatisfaction of the people, a single voice in power for so long. And that's why I was so enthusiastic about what was happening there."" But she said there are also very important differences -- namely Cuba's low internet penetration. Recent figures show an estimated 1.6 million people there are internet users, out of a population of 11.2 million. According to the leaked video, the Cuban government's fear is that U.S.-backed dissidents will use social networks like Twitter and Facebook to incite unrest. ""Technology in itself isn't a threat,"" the lecturer says. ""What can be a threat is the person behind the technology, in the same way it can be an opportunity for us to do something with it."" Cuba has jailed American aid worker Alan Gross, who was a subcontractor for USAID. Cuban officials have accused him of distributing illegal satellite equipment to dissidents to help them connect to the internet. The State Department and Gross' family say he was working with Jewish groups. Gross has been formally charged with ""acts against the independence and territorial integrity of Cuba"" and could face up to 20 years in prison when his case goes to trial. In the leaked video, he's called a ""mercenary."" ""It's just like the Bay of Pigs invasion,"" the lecturer says. ""But this man is coming with different weapons. He didn't come on a boat with a gun in his hand, but it's the same story."" Nonetheless, Cuba isn't turning its back on the internet. Dozens of pro-government blogs have also appeared, many of them written by journalists who work for state-run media. ""They have their bloggers and we have our bloggers,"" the unidentified man in the video says at one point. ""We'll see who comes out stronger."" For years, the government blamed the U.S. embargo for restricted access to the internet, but this month, it completed an undersea fiber optic cable connecting the island to Venezuela. When that network goes online this summer, Cuba's bandwidth will increase by 3000. But the question remains whether Cubans will be allowed unlimited access to it without restrictions. Cuba currently accesses the internet via expensive satellite connections. As a result, the government has said it cannot offer internet access to the broader population, lacking the money to create the necessary infrastructure to support it. It has given priority to education and health workers, who often can only access a limited intranet. The government also provides connections at very high costs to foreign diplomats, businesses and journalists.","A leaked video appears to show an intelligence briefing about the internet .

"(CNN) -- In Shandong Province in northeastern China, the nation's grain heartland, the worst drought in 60 years has raised the specter of shortages for the world's largest wheat producer. Russia -- still reeling from a drought that slashed wheat harvest by nearly 40% and spurred Moscow to ban exports last summer -- hopes new, resilient strains of the crop will lead to a resumption of wheat exports. However, soil damaged by the drought means nearly 10% of Russian wheat fields couldn't be planted this year. Social media may have fanned the flames of revolt which toppled governments in Tunisia and Egypt and triggered demonstrations across the Middle East. But the tinderbox was built on high unemployment, corruption and rising food prices. It's a telling sign that the trouble in Tunisia started with the self immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor protesting the police seizure of his produce cart. ""I think that we have to be careful, as an international community, not to let food prices become not [only] a national security threat in countries, but a global security threat,"" Ngozi Iweala, managing director of the World Bank, told CNN. Rising food prices have driven nearly 44 million people into poverty since June, according to World Bank estimates released this week, pushing the number of chronically hungry toward 1 billion. Global food prices rose 29% in the past year due to weather shocks such as the Russian drought and subsequent export ban, as well as the growing appetite for biofuels and rising demand from emerging economies such as Brazil, India and China. Rising inflation a top Chinese concern . Price increases were led by sugar and wheat, at 20%. Fats and oils used in cooking rose 22%, according to the World Bank. ""Our research shows higher global wheat prices have directly fed into sharp increases in domestic wheat prices in many countries,"" Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said earlier this week. ""In just six months, prices for wheat rose by more than 50% in Kyrgyzstan; 45% in Bangladesh and 33% in Mongolia."" Rising food prices create political strife. Nations in northern Africa and the Middle East -- where arable land is scarce -- scour Eastern Europe and Central Asia for grain deals. When Rachid Rachid was Egypt's Trade and Industry Minister, he personally combed the world for wheat -- with visits to Russia and Central Asia -- attempting to meet the domestic demand of six million tons a year. ""The fact you know that you need this much quantity to feed the people in Egypt and knowing that there is not that much quantity around the world makes you really scared,"" Rachid told CNN. The price of a kilogram of onions in India nearly doubled from September to December, resulting in an export ban that was lifted this week after Indian farmers protested and onion prices plummeted. Chinese food prices rose 10.3% in January, raising concerns about the economy overheating. In the U.S. consumer prices rose only 1.6% in January, but as CNNMoney reports prices for clothing, appliances and food are expected to rise as increasing demand from emerging economies hikes the cost of raw materials. ""This is something we need to really pay attention to, because it impacts the most vulnerable: children, women, pregnant women and it really hits the poor,"" said Iweala of the World Bank. CNN's Richard Quest, Kevin Voigt, John Defterios, Colleen McEdwards and Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","The World Bank sounded the alarm this week on rising global food prices .

"(CNN) -- Key facts about Bahrain, the Persian Gulf island state now facing protests similar to those that have wracked other Middle Eastern countries, as compiled by the CNN Wire: . GEOGRAPHY AND POPULATION: . -- Bahrain is a chain of small islands off the eastern shore of the Arabian Peninsula, nestled between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The kingdom takes its name from the largest island, where the capital, Manama, is located. -- Bahrain's 2010 census found a population of 1.2 million, but Bahrainis are a minority in their own country. About 54 percent of its population are expatriates, the census found. -- Though its ruling family is Sunni, Shiite Muslims make up about two-thirds of Bahrain's population. -- A 2006 study by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions reported that guest workers make up 60 percent of the country's labor force. -- Bahrainis have had universal suffrage since 2002. The lower house of its parliament is elected, while the upper house is appointed by the king. HISTORY: . -- Bahrain's current monarch, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, is the latest ruler in an Arab dynasty that wrested control of the archipelago from Persia in the 1780s. -- Bahrain was a British protectorate from 1861 to 1971, when it became fully independent. -- Before the discovery of oil in 1932, pearls were the backbone of Bahrain's economy. That history is reflected in the monumental sculpture that sits in Manama's Pearl Roundabout, the scene of some of the recent demonstrations. -- Pop star Michael Jackson moved to the island kingdom with his family after his 2005 acquittal on child molestation charges in the United States and spent almost a year as a personal guest of a Bahraini prince. The prince later sued Jackson, claiming he had paid all of Jackson's living expenses and advanced funds on a music contract on which the singer reneged. The case was settled in 2008, less than a year before Jackson's death. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: . -- Bahrain has been the headquarters of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, the naval arm of American forces in the Middle East, since 1995. The U.S. Navy has maintained a presence there since 1949. -- Bahrain has contributed a contingent of police to help provide security for the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Afghanistan. -- The monarchy views Iran, its neighbor across the Persian Gulf and onetime ruler, with ""deep suspicion"" and suspects it of supporting Shiite opposition movements, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable disclosed by the WikiLeaks website. -- Iran has asserted territorial claims over Bahrain both before and after the 1979 revolution that deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and brought the current Islamic republic to power. ECONOMY: . Petroleum makes up about 30 percent of the country's economy. But at an estimated 125 million barrels, Bahrain's oil reserves are a tiny fraction of those held by most of their neighbors. Since the 1960s, the monarchy has worked to diversify its economy, turning the country into a banking, shipping and refining center. Bahrain was the first Middle Eastern country to land a Formula One Grand Prix race, in 2004. With its racing season set to begin in March, Shaikh Salman bin Isa Al Khalifa said Tuesday that race authorities are keeping a close eye on the protests ""and will respond appropriately to any further developments.""","Bahrain is chain of small islands off eastern shore of Arabian Peninsula .

"(CNN) -- South Korean golfer In-Kyung Kim retained the lead at the halfway stage of the season-opening LPGA Thailand event on Friday, but is being chased by world No. 1 Yani Tseng and Michelle Wie. The 22-year-old Kim, seeking her fourth victory in successive years on the top women's circuit, faltered with a one-over-par 73 at Siam Country Club's Old Course but ended the day with a one-shot advantage. Kim, who finished third in two of last season's four majors, had matched the course record of 63 in her opening round on Thursday. Taiwan's Tseng carded a 71 in soggy fairway conditions following heavy rain earlier this week, while American Wie joined her on seven-under 137 after a 68. ""I feel exhausted. It's the first event, but it feels like the last event,"" Kim, who had four bogeys in her opening nine holes, told reporters. ""It was such a difference coming from yesterday when I teed off first and I didn't really expect much. I don't know, I think I was too hard on myself the first nine holes and I couldn't really find a rhythm."" Wie said the greens were drying out in the hot sun. ""I think it's a lot firmer. The greens are very fast. I need to stop hitting it five feet past the holes on my putts,"" she said. Americans Paula Creamer and Juli Inkster were tied for fourth on five under, shooting 70 and 73 respectively to be level with Japan's Momoko Ueda (69) and South Korea's Na Yeon Choi (70). Norway's Suzann Pettersen, who won her first major title last year, was tied for eighth after a 72. Defending champion Ai Miyazato was tied for 25th after a second-round 69. Meanwhile, Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello holds a one-shot lead after the fog-delayed second round of the men's European Tour event in India. The world No. 125 shot a three-under 69 at the Avantha Masters in New Delhi on Friday to be clear of a bunch of six players at the halfway stage. Of that group, Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee and Indian Jeev Milkha Singh can both pass his total of eight-under 136 when they complete their final seven holes on Saturday. World No. 68 Jaidee is the only player in the field ranked inside the top-100. An incredible nine players shared the lead after the opening round of the PGA Tour's Northern Trust Open in Los Angeles on Thursday. John Senden set the clubhouse target with a four-under 67 at Riviera Country Club, then was joined by fellow Australians Robert Allenby and Aaron Baddeley, Britain's Martin Laird, Sweden's Carl Pettersson and Americans Spencer Levin, Ben Martin, Bill Haas and J.B. Holmes. Three-time major winner Padraig Harrington, former world No. 1s Vijay Singh and Fred Couples, plus European Ryder Cup star Luke Donald were in another group of nine on 68.","In-Kyung Kim keeps Thai lead despite struggling with a one-over 73 on Friday .

"Chimaltenango, Guatemala (CNN) -- In rural Guatemala, all it takes is a few minutes for tons of heavy mud to plow into a vulnerable hillside community and swallow its people and their homes. Sometimes, the devastation is there for all to see. But not always. ""I met a couple who lost their children and their home ... all of it just gone,"" Anne Hallum said, recalling a trip to the country in 2005. ""We arrived, and it was hard to believe anyone had died. There weren't bodies lying around. ... They were buried under."" Hundreds of dangerous mudslides occur every year during Guatemala's rainy season, which lasts from mid-May until October or November. In one extreme case, a mudslide resulted in 700 deaths, according to CEPAL, the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America. There are plenty of natural reasons why Guatemalans are vulnerable to mudslides: frequent earthquakes, hurricanes and heavy rains oversaturate Guatemala's mountainous terrain and muddy the soil. But Hallum said there's another mudslide trigger to consider. ""Deforestation -- or the absence of trees -- causes mudslides to occur,"" said Hallum, co-founder of the Alliance for International Reforestation, a nonprofit trying to help the villagers protect themselves from mudslides. ""Trees are cut for firewood and to make room for the crops, and without realizing it ... they've taken away their protection. Where it used to be rainforest becomes an open space for the mud to come right on through."" Nearly 373 square kilometers of trees are destroyed each year in Guatemala, according to the University of Santa Barbara's Department of Geography. Through her group's efforts, Hallum is inspiring villagers to stop chopping and, instead, use trees to safeguard their lives and crops against mudslides. The effort, nearly 20 years strong, was one Hallum said she never really planned. A political science professor at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, Hallum traveled to the rural town of Nueva Concepcion, Guatemala, in 1991 as an adviser for a university field trip. It was her first trip outside the United States, and despite not being able to speak Spanish, she was moved by a blatant poverty that ""broke her heart"" and birthed a ""new purpose."" ""I went into the villages where lots of the trees were cut down, and I held some of the children,"" said Hallum, 57. ""They were listless and couldn't hold themselves up. Their eyes were dull, and it became pretty clear that they were malnourished."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . The farms she visited were not sustainable, she said, because the soil was eroded and lacked nutrients. Hallum, a self-proclaimed nature lover, was not formally trained in agriculture, but she knew some basic facts about trees and food products that could be cheaply grown. With the help of a former student, she researched rural resources and learned that many local Guatemalan tree varieties could be strategically replanted to provide fruit, fertilizer, coffee, food and medicinal herbs where resources were failing or nonexistent. ""When we started, it was all about fighting poverty,"" Hallum said. ""We wanted to help families farm better and feed their children better. But we started to notice that in the areas where (pine) trees were planted, the mudslides were no longer occurring. So that brought a new focus for us. Food, shade, fertilizer and mudslide protection -- the trees can do it all."" Not all trees that are planted can protect against mudslides, but Hallum said pine trees planted on high mountain slopes can be most effective. Pine trees have long, anchoring tap roots that can extend 6 meters below the soil. When they are planted in slopes above residential areas, Hallum explained, heavy rains are unlikely to loosen their grip on the soil. ""We learned the hard way that without trees, we are at risk, and our land is at risk,"" said Jose Avelino Boc, a lemon farmer and Alliance program participant. Boc, 53, has lost family and friends to mudslide disasters, and he now attributes his life and the success of his farm to Hallum's nonprofit. ""The trees give us life,"" he said. ""If there is too much rain, they keep the soil. And the mountainside doesn't fall down anymore."" Constant land surveys, particularly during the rainy season, help Hallum and her team identify which rural areas need assistance. But the easiest way to determine which village to target next, Hallum said, is simply ""to answer the door."" ""They're coming to us directly now to ask for help,"" Hallum said. ""People know us, and now they trust us."" Local Guatemalan staff -- all trained agroforestry technicians -- are assigned six villages each and provide free weekly instructional courses on topics like tree planting, sustainable farming and air quality. Each technician remains in his or her assigned communities for five years. Hallum credits her group's success to this commitment of staying within a community until the community itself can see and reap benefits. ""It's a lot of work,"" Hallum said. ""We don't come in, plant some trees and leave. We do that, and they'll cut them down. It's a step-by-step process that starts with education. In a little time, they notice their crops are doing better; mudslides aren't happening. And the behavior changes: They start to protect the trees. We say: 'All right, you've got it. You know how to do this now.' Then we leave ... on to the next village."" The Alliance for International Reforestation has helped 110 rural villages plant more than 3.8 million trees throughout Guatemala. As an added incentive for attending classes and planting trees, the group donates and installs ecofriendly, fuel-efficient cooking stoves to some program participants based on economic need. These stoves require very little firewood and give off no emissions. With the stoves, not only are fewer trees cut down, but families no longer inhale dangerous fumes caused by stovetop, chimney-less cooking. The group also provides educational resources and promotes economic independence within communities. Its agroforestry textbook series has been adopted by more than 200 Guatemalan schools. Hundreds of women have also benefited from the rural farming initiative. They help generate income for their families from the sale of fruits, salves and shampoos created from trees and fruits they learned to harvest. ""I learned so much from AIR and from Anne,"" Doña Elena Siquinajay said. ""We're 50 women in our village working together. ... We come together and plant in the tree nurseries or pack the products, and we support each other. It is a lot of work, but we enjoy it very much. Without the program, some of us would not learn anything."" Although Hallum remains a full-time university professor, she spends all of her free time in Guatemala. After 40 visits, she is happy with the progress of the program and vows to keep returning to the ""place where her heart remains."" ""I can go back to areas that were nothing but mudslides and soil erosion, and now I see forest,"" Hallum said. ""This is not just a project. We are a team. It's about building the community and saving the planet. ... It's about a better future for the children."" Want to get involved?

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's ruling party on Friday declared incumbent Goodluck Jonathan its presidential candidate in the April elections after he won a primary vote in Africa' most populous nation. The president got 77.7% of the vote in the People's Democratic Party primary, election officials said. He beat rival Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president supported by a group of influential northern leaders. Jonathan is from the Niger Delta in the Christian-dominated south while Abubakar is from the majority Muslim north. The incumbent's candidacy sparked a controversy because an unofficial zoning agreement in the ruling party aims to rotate power between the north and the south every two terms. Jonathan, then the vice president, inherited the presidency when President Umaru Yar'Adua, a northerner, died during his first term last year. Some in the ruling party have said a northerner should have replaced Yar'Adua to honor the zoning  agreement. Nigeria has been rocked by violence in recent years, which the government has blamed on Islamist extremists. Christmas Eve attacks in the volatile northern city of Jos killed at least 31 people. Earlier this week, an attack on a Christian village in central Nigeria left 13 people dead, an official said. The village was attacked at midnight by unknown assailants. Militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta have also been a focal point in recent years.  The most prominent rebel group in the area, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, and other militants say they're fighting for a fairer distribution of the region's oil wealth. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Goodluck Jonathan gets 77.7% of the vote in the People's Democratic Party primary .

"New York (CNN) -- A veteran police officer died from his injuries Friday after a shooting in Poughkeepsie, New York, according to the Poughkeepsie Police Department. The name of the deceased officer, an 18-year veteran of the department, was not released pending notification of relatives. Another police officer was being treated for a minor injury at Vasser Medical Center, Poughkeepsie Police Chief Ronald Knapp said at a press conference Friday afternoon. ""Today is the worst day our city has seen in perhaps our history,"" Mayor Mike Tkazyik said. Two other people died in the incident. The suspected gunman died from gunshot wounds at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, according to hospital spokesman Greg Zurawick. Another victim, an unidentified female, was also shot, according to Knapp. She is believed to be the wife of the suspected gunman. The deceased officer suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, according to Knapp. A confrontation began around 1 p.m. Friday after Poughkeepsie authorities received reports of a shooting in a small parking lot. An officer noticed a man fleeing the scene of the shooting with a child in his arms and tried to confront the man. The child was removed from the man, but another confrontation involving multiple officers ensued, Knapp said. That was when the fatal shootings took place. The child is now in custody of New York state juvenile authorities.","Mayor: ""Today is the worst day our city has seen perhaps in our history""

"(CNN) -- When the FBI called Martha Huie's house in 2005, she didn't think much of it. ""I answered the phone, and he identified himself and wanted to speak with Ernest Withers. I said, 'This is not Ernest Withers!'"" Huie recalled, laughing. Last year, she learned the likely reason for the call was no laughing matter. In 2010, The Memphis Commercial Appeal revealed that the friend she knew for almost 20 years was an FBI informant. As the pre-eminent photographer of the civil rights era, Withers had close access to leaders of the movement. To some, charges of informing represented a betrayal of the highest sort. But not to Huie. Watch the trailer for In America's documentary about Withers, ""Pictures Don't Lie"" ""I can't think about why it was presented in such shock value,"" Huie said. ""A lot of people talk to the FBI. If the FBI wants to talk to you, you talk to them. It's just not a horror story, and Ernest just doesn't deserve that."" Huie met Withers at a contemporary art show in Memphis in 1988. ""We were the senior people there!"" she laughs. ""That was how Ernest and me started talking."" He was black. She was white. He grew up poor in Tennessee. She had a relatively privileged upbringing in Alabama. Withers' wife, Dorothy, supported his fledgling photography business and eight children. Huie's late husband, William Bradford Huie, was a celebrated author and investigative journalist who chronicled the events of the civil rights movement and broke the story when two white men confessed to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, a black teen. Withers, too, had covered the Emmett Till case. Huie and Withers formed an immediate bond over the journalistic work, but it was their mutual appreciation of art and history that kept them talking. The photographer shared stories about his experiences during the civil rights movement and how he learned to use a camera. In one conversation, Withers told Huie how he learned to see color. ""When he was a young boy, his mother died. His stepmother was his mother. And she sewed. She made things for rich white women, and she would send him to the store to buy thread,"" Huie said. ""And if he didn't come back with the exact right color, he would have to go right back. And there's where he learned to see matching colors."" When an FBI agent called Huie a second time in 2005, she assumed again it was a mistake, and gave the agent Withers' number. She still doesn't know why they called her house. When Withers died in 2007, his funeral was front-page news in Memphis. Huie and Withers never spoke about his involvement with the FBI, and she isn't concerned that the information will affect his legacy. ""Ernest was not a traitor, or doing anything political or underhanded,"" Huie said. ""If the FBI wanted to hand him some grocery money, then so what?"" While the civil rights photographer later became famous for his photographs, he never achieved fortune. But, according to Huie, he lived a life rich in other ways. ""He tried his best every day of his life and made a lot of mistakes and laughed at himself,"" Huie reminisced. ""He was on the right side all the way, all the time. And he played it like he needed to."" CNN's Alicia Stewart contributed to this report.","Civil rights photographer Ernest Withers was revealed in 2010 to be an FBI informant .

"(CNN) -- Her curriculum vitae makes for impressive, if exhausting, reading. Dr. Nahed Taher tells CNN her views on currencies, the Saudi economy and whether women should be allowed to drive . While fulfilling a demanding role as the first female head of a Saudi investment bank -- which she founded -- Dr. Nahed Taher also sits on the board of a number of private companies and business committees. She has twice been named businesswoman of the year, and has made Forbes' list of the world's most powerful women. John Defterios found a spare moment to sit down with Dr Nahed Taher, the founder, CEO and Executive Director of Gulf One Investment Bank. John Defterios (JD): Leading up to the GCC meeting in Doha, there was a great deal of not just speculation but even policy statements that this was the right time to de-peg from the US dollar. Why the backtrack, almost at the last minute, in your view? Dr. Nahed Taher (NT): They believe that it's a cycle not a trend. However, I have some concerns. Having the dollar as a majority of this basket is not a problem, but it should be, it's only wise to do this at the beginning, because they cannot shift dramatically towards a flowing exchange rate or whatever, it should be a managed float. JD: Speaking of inflation, there's a real number that's put out by different governments in this region, and then the realities. What's the real inflation right now because of the import cost rising with the weaker dollar? NT: As an economist you can measure the inflationary gap, which is the difference between the growth in the money supply and the growth in the real GDP. And this is, in Saudi Arabia, 15%. So the inflationary gap is 15%, meaning that injection of money in the economy is not having an equal absorption capacity in the economy to create income. It's just burning the money in consumption. JD: Let's look out a little bit here into the future, you know, 5-10 years away. Can you create a single market for the trading of goods, a greater air of free trade association that's real that lowers barriers so you have more inter-Arab trade? NT: The problem is that we all import the same thing, and we all export the same thing almost. So there is not really intra-trade between us that makes sense a lot. Because for the GCC, for example, we all import everything from outside. What are we importing from each other? Nothing. Almost, I mean a minority. But, that's what's needed in the future. If we go, for example, into production more like petrol-chemical and mining and whatever we should really create less barriers, and facilitate intra-trade and intra-production as well... and go in mega-companies, not to have a petrol-chemical company in Saudi and one in Kuwait and whatever, and compete, we should work more towards collaboration. JD: Is the formula correct? When you drive the streets of Jeddah do you say I think we'll get it right this time, the wealth that's coming into the country, recalibrating what we want to do with Saudi Arabia? NT: There is a big recognition that this boom is totally different than the first boom. At the first boom we didn't have any debt. Now we have a government debt, and we have private sector debt. So we recognize that this wealth has to be wisely spent on projects for the future that can co-op with future demand. We have 60% of our population under 24-years-old, which are baby boomers hopefully we don't want them to be the baby losers in the future. JD: How about as a woman, do you think that it's a bit strange that you can't drive on the streets but you can sign multi-million or billion dollar deals? NT: I will leave this to my dearest King Abdullah, to decide. I know he's supportive and he will have it very soon, in the right time.

"Rabat, Morocco (CNN) -- Five charred bodies were found Monday in a Moroccan bank that burned down during protests the day before, Morocco's state-run news agency reported, citing the country's interior minister. The bodies were found in a bank in the town of Al Hoceima in northern Morocco, Interior Minister Taib Cherkaoui told reporters on Monday. He said the acts of vandalism followed the peaceful protests in at least six cities Sunday, according to Agence Maghreb Arabe Presse. He estimated that about 37,000 people participated in the protests nationwide. The demonstrators were calling for political reform, according to Human Rights Watch. Cherkaoui said Monday they included labor unions, youth organizations and human rights groups. Police stayed away from the marches and demonstrations, most of which were peaceful, Human Rights Watch reported. The vandalism broke out in a handful of cities afterward, Cherkaoui said, describing it as acts of sabotage committed by troublemakers including ex-convicts. Twenty-four banks were burned, he said, along with 50 shops and private buildings and 66 vehicles. Authorities dispersed the vandals and made arrests, Cherkaoui said, according to Agence Maghreb Arabe Presse. About 120 people are awaiting trial, he said, and detained minors were returned to their parents. Some 128 people were injured, he said, including 115 security forces members. Cherkaoui said authorities are investigating the five deaths in the bank, according to the news agency. The victims are thought to be computer technicians. Banks in Morocco are not open on Sunday. The interior minister said the protests included sit-ins, rallies and demonstrations, Agence Maghreb Arabe Presse reported. ""Thanks to the expanding liberties, the practice of a healthy and authentic democracy and the right to the freedom of expression enjoyed in our country, these protests took place in a peaceful environment marked by serenity and discipline,"" he said, according to the report. A government spokesman told a Russian television station on Sunday that protests in Morocco are not unusual, according to the Moroccan state news agency. ""Unlike most Arab countries, rallies and protests are common in Morocco,"" said Khalid Naciri, communication minister and government spokesman. Naciri said the protesters' demands are ""ordinary"" and that the rallies take place lawfully and preserved public order in an environment of ""stability."" He also said the protests are part of the practice of democracy, Agence Maghreb Arabe Presse said. Demonstrators' demands are on the agenda of most political parties, he said. Morocco's laws on demonstrations are liberal. Cherkaoui emphasized Monday that people are free to demonstrate in the country. But, he said, while authorities support freedom of expression, they will intervene to stop those who are disrupting public order or damaging property, the news agency said. In Rabat, Morocco's capital, an estimated 2,000 demonstrators gathered at Bab al-Had Square and marched to parliament, where they chanted slogans calling for change, including ""Down with tyranny"" and ""The people demand change,"" according to Human Rights Watch. Hundreds also demonstrated in Casablanca, Marrakesh and Agadir, Human Rights Watch said, as well as in the Rif, the mountainous area in northern Morocco. There were reports that protesters set fire to a police station in Marrakesh, the organization reported, citing a witness. A few unarmed, uniformed police officers monitored the Rabat protests, the group said. There were no reports of arrests in the capital, according to Human Rights Watch. In Larache in northwest Morocco, a representative of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights reported that protesters set fire to a police station, robbed stores and attempted to break into banks, Human Rights Watch said. Cherkaoui told reporters they also stormed a customs administration building and looted drugs and alcohol that had been seized, Agence Maghreb Arabe Presse said. And in Al Hoceima, where the bodies were found, demonstrators vandalized a stadium, two political party offices and a pair of hotels, the organization said, citing activists in the city. Security forces responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, and there were reports of injuries, the group said. A small police building was also burned there, Cherkaoui said. Meanwhile, youth groups who demonstrated over the weekend are calling for their own political party. Morocco is much more advanced in many areas compared to Egypt and Tunisia and aligns itself more with Europe than other Arab countries in the region. The king, who is widely revered, is pushing through reforms in the country, but the government is not so well respected by many people here, particularly the youth. ""What happened over the weekend is that people sent a message to the king. We want reform in justice and free access to hospitals,"" said Fatiha Layadi, an opposition member of parliament. ""The problem is that these groups don't feel there is a platform for their views. There's no debate, so if we are to have more of these demonstrations, firstly the government needs to better organize itself, but secondly it would be better if these (youths) could have a voice of their own through the media."" There are no political debate shows, Layadi said, but youths on Facebook are asking for help in forming a political party. Journalist Martin Jay contributed to this report for CNN.","NEW: Interior minister says vandalism broke out after the demonstrations .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- One person was killed and more that two dozen were hurt in a fresh round of anti-government protests in Yemen on Thursday, eyewitnesses and an opposition lawmaker reported. An 18-year-old demonstrator died in Aden when police fired to disperse protesters, said Aref al-Qubati, a participant who said the victim was a friend of his. It was the second fatality reported in the past two days in Aden, where authorities cut off power to the Al-Mansoora district and fired into the air to break up the crowd of about 3,000. At least 12 other people were wounded in clashes with security forces throughout the day, witnesses said. But journalists have been barred from the city's Al-Naqeeb hospital, and about 400 guards surrounded the facility. And in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, at least 20 people were injured in clashes between stone-throwing pro- and anti-government demonstrators, opposition lawmaker Ahmed Hashid told CNN. Police at the scene did not try to intervene, he said. The clash took place in western Sanaa, with about 600 government opponents there at the peak, anti-government demonstrators claimed. The opponents had planned to gather at Sanaa University, but said they found government supporters there who forced them to leave, they said. By the time CNN arrived, there were about 100 anti-government protesters and 300 to 400 supporters of the government near the intersection of Rabat Street and Fitteen Street. One injured person was carried away while CNN was present, but it was not clear how serious the injuries were. Gunfire was heard in the area as well, but it was difficult to determine who was shooting or what the target was. Yemen is among several Middle Eastern nations to find itself convulsed by daily protests after the revolts that toppled the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt in recent weeks. Anti-government protesters have called for the ouster of longtime Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has ruled the country since 1978. The country has been wracked by a Shiite . Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives, a secessionist movement in its once-independent south and a looming shortage of water. In an attempt to quell growing discontent, Saleh has announced that he won't seek another term in 2013 and would postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for April to allow more time for reform talks with the opposition. It is not clear who the pro-government demonstrators are. Anti-government activists say the government is putting hired thugs and plainclothes police on the street to break up protests, but pro-government demonstrators have told CNN they are there of their own volition and are not being paid. The government has not responded to CNN questions about the pro-government demonstrators. The top European Union foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, is ""very concerned"" about the events in Aden, her representative said in a statement Thursday. Ashton ""strongly deplores the loss of life and violence and calls for calm and restraint of all parties,"" the statement said, calling for ""genuine, comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue."" Human rights activists accused pro-government demonstrators of beating students after a similar protest in Sanaa Wednesday. Witnesses in Aden said the victim was an 18-year-old who was shot by security forces as they tried to disperse the crowd. Video distributed by student activists appeared to show the youth being carried away, bleeding heavily from his left side. But CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video, and there was no immediate confirmation of the fatality from hospital officials. The Aden protest drew thousands of demonstrators, mostly students, to the city's Al Mansoora district for a sixth straight day. And in Sanaa, students at Sanaa University rallied inside the gates of the campus in a demonstration organized by the head of the university's student union, said Omar Al-Nihmi, a third-year media student at the school. The three students injured in Sanaa were attacked while on their way home from the university demonstration, human rights activist Abdul Rahman Barman said. Barman said he took one of the students to the hospital with head injuries from being hit with sticks, but the other two had only minor injuries. The student protest began as a call for an improved curriculum, for removal of the university dean and for security forces to remain off-campus. But about 90 minutes into the event, the mood turned anti-government, said third-year student Salah Al-Janadi. More students showed up, both Al-Nihmi and Al-Janadi said, and the protesters began chanting anti-government slogans such as ""The people want the fall of the regime"" and ""Oh Ali, son of Saleh, your regime is no good."" They also chanted, ""Our protests are peaceful and we don't have weapons."" Shortly afterward, hundreds of pro-government demonstrators turned up -- but they were outside the university gates, while the students were inside. The pro-government demonstrators began throwing rocks, Al-Janadi said. Al-Janadi said he was told by the protest organizers ""that because today's protest was a student union protest at the university, security forces at the scene would not interfere."" Hundreds of police were on the scene as well. They did not interfere with protesters, Al-Janadi said, but fired bullets into the air, successfully dispersing the crowds.

"(CNN) -- A Rosary service and funeral were scheduled this week for Jaime Zapata, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who was killed in Mexico last week. The slain agent will be buried in his hometown of Brownsville, Texas. He was killed and another agent was injured on a highway in Mexico's San Luis Potosi state after they were run off the road by two vehicles believed to be driven by members of the Zetas drug cartel, authorities have said. Zapata, 32, was based in Laredo, Texas, and was in Mexico on temporary assignment. ""His dedication to service and integrity was unparalleled.

The Rosary service, in which mourners pray for the repose of the soul of the departed, will be at 7 p.m. Monday at the Brownsville Events Center. The funeral mass will take place in the same place at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday. He will be buried at Rose Lawn Gardens Cemetery.

"(CNN) -- Two German journalists have been released  from prison after being charged with espionage in Iran for interviewing the son and lawyer of a woman condemned to die by stoning, a spokesman for Germany's Foreign Ministry confirmed Saturday. Both men were in the northwestern city of Tabriz, accompanied by German consular officials, the spokesman said. The officials hoped to bring them to the German Embassy in Tehran later in the day, though no other details were given. Marcus Hellwig and Jens Koch had been sentenced to 20 months in prison. But Iran's Revolution Court dismissed the sentences, instead slapping each with $50,000 fines, Iran's state-run Press TV said. The two men were arrested in October after they interviewed the son and lawyer of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning. ""Their reports and propaganda in Tabriz proved that they are in the country for spying,"" Malek Ajdar Shafiee, the head of the Justice Department of East Azarbaijan, was quoted as saying by Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency.","NEW: Germany confirms release of reporters .

"(CNN) -- One of the Dallas Cowboys' major donors is a named plaintiff in a class action lawsuit, seeking more than $5 million, over unavailability of seats at Super Bowl XLV, according to documents filed Monday at a U.S. District Court in Texas. The Cowboys, along with team owner Jerry Jones, the National Football League and corporate entities were named as defendants in the suit, along with corporate entities that manage Cowboys Stadium, where the Green Bay Packers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25 Sunday. About 1,250 fans with tickets were affected in the seating fiasco, which came about because certain sections of Cowboys Stadium that were being added in an effort to boost attendance weren't ready by game time. About 850 of the fans were relocated to other seats, and some 400 weren't, the NFL said. Mike Dolabi of Tarrant County, Texas, who is one of the ""Founders"" of Texas Stadium who paid a minimum $100,000 per seat to help pay for the state-of-the-art venue's construction, was one of the named plaintiffs in the class action. Dolabi and others had been assigned to ""seats with obstructed views and temporary metal fold-out chairs"" that ""lacked any reasonable view of the stadium's prized 'video board,' which defendant Jones and the Cowboys routinely claim is one of the most unique and best features of Cowboys Stadium,"" the lawsuit says. The lawsuit also notes that the Cowboys and the NFL knew that a problem with seating was unfolding in the days before the Super Bowl but did not notify ticket-holders that there might be a problem. Jones and NFL President Roger Goodell on Monday both apologized to fans affected by the seat shortage. Also, the league promised to give a free ticket to next year's Super Bowl and a refund of triple the cost of the $800 face value of the ticket to each of the 400 fans denied seats -- or a free ticket to a future Super Bowl game of the fan's choice, plus round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations. Fans can pick the option they want. Not good enough, the plaintiffs say: ""(T)his monetary sum is wholly insufficient to compensate plaintiffs for all of their expenses, including but not limited to travel costs, or of their disappointment and frustration in not being able to properly enjoy the Super Bowl.""","Class action is filed on behalf of Super Bowl fans who showed up to find they had no seats .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Authorities in Egypt have frozen the assets of former President Hosni Mubarak and his family, state-run media reported Monday. Attorney General Abdel Meguid Mahmoud requested the action, according to the state-run EgyNews website. Along with Mubarak's assets, those belonging to his wife, Suzanne, were also frozen, along with the assets of the former president's eldest son, Alaa, and younger son, Gamal, and both of the sons' wives, according to the report. After 30 years, Mubarak stepped down as Egypt's president February 11 following 18 days of unrest. The same day, Switzerland's government moved to freeze any assets in the country's banks that might belong to Mubarak or his family. ""The (government) intends in doing so to avoid any risk of embezzlement of Egyptian state property,"" Swiss officials said in a statement at the time. In addition, the prosecutor has requested an investigation into Mubarak's assets, prompted by citizen complaints, Egyptian state television reported. On Sunday, Mubarak's attorney said that false information had been published by media outlets both in Egypt and elsewhere regarding the former president's wealth, calling it ""baseless rumors ... an attempt to cause damage to his reputation and his integrity,"" according to EgyNews. And on Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq responded to a question on the matter during a meeting with newspaper editors and media representatives by saying he only knew what he ""read about Mubarak's wealth in the newspapers and in the media, just like everyone else,"" EgyNews reported. Shafiq said that any action on the former president's assets was up to the country's Military Council. Two former Egyptian ministers were transferred to criminal court on Monday, according to state news agency MENA. Former Interior Minister Habib al-Adly, whose agency was reponsible for Egyptian police and paramilitary forces, and Zuhair Garana, former tourism minister, will face corruption charges, MENA reported. Al-Adly is charged with racketeering and money laundering, according to EgyNews, and Garana is charged with premeditated damage to public property and illegally enabling close associates to obtain financial benefits. The two were among four ministers from Mubarak's government jailed last week, state media reported. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron arrived Monday in Cairo, his office said, for meetings with Egypt's military leadership, to which Mubarak ceded power. Cameron met Monday with Mohammed Tantawi, head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, according to his office. Cameron ""spoke of the UK's willingness to be helpful and contribute to a successful political transition,"" the Downing Street website reported. ""This is a great opportunity for us to go and talk to those currently running Egypt to make sure this really is a genuine transition from military rule to civilian rule and see what friendly countries like Britain and others in Europe can do to help,"" Cameron said, according to the website. Cameron also plans to meet with Shafiq as well as ""members of the opposition movement,"" his office said. It was unclear whether Cameron would meet with the banned Muslim Brotherhood group. The opposition group, although officiallyillegal, has said it will apply to become a political party in Mubarak's absence. It has said it does not plan to field a candidate for president when elections are held to replace Mubarak.

The couple has lived separately since Shimon Peres was elected president in 2007, with his wife -- who preferred to remain out of the public eye -- remaining in their Tel Aviv home while her husband moved to the official residence in Jerusalem. Dr. Rafi Valdan, Peres' son-in-law, told Israel Radio that she was found dead Thursday morning when a grandchild came to visit her, according to the daily newspaper Haaretz. Sonia Peres was ""all nobility and devotion,"" Valdan said. ""The family members were very close to her. We would see her almost every day.""

"(CNN) -- The stepmother of a disabled girl whose remains were found after she went missing in North Carolina has been indicted on a bigamy charge. Elisa Baker, the stepmother of Zahra Baker, 10, is accused of marrying the girl's father before divorcing her previous husband, a Catawaba County court official said Tuesday. The family made international news late last year after the freckled-faced young girl went missing from their home in Hickory, North Carolina. The girl lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both ears while being treated for cancer. Police found Zahra's remains on November 11, just over a month after she was reported missing. Elisa Baker was charged with obstruction of justice after she admitted to planting a fake ransom note. Documents released after Zahra's remains were found tell a grisly story. The stepmother told police the girl was killed two weeks before she was reported missing, according to search warrants. She said the disabled girl's body was dismembered and disposed of in various locations, documents show. A search warrant dated October 27 shows police were looking for latex gloves used to dismember Zahra and trash bags used to store the remains. No one has been directly charged in the girl's death.","The disabled girl's remains were found after she went missing in North Carolina .

"(Mashable) -- Facebook accidentally went live with a handful of prototype features earlier today, including a site-wide yet short-lived overhaul of Pages. Roughly 45 minutes after the mistaken update, Facebook disabled the site, reverted back to its previous state and then tweeted apologetically about the downtime. But that brief span of time was enough for Facebook members and Page admins to get a sneak peak at new features in the works. Facebook admitted to pushing features before their time. ""Also, some internal prototypes were exposed to people and resulted in us disabling the site briefly. It's now back to normal,"" read a tweet from Facebook. So what were those prototypes exactly? Screenshots shared with us and surfaced through other media outlets suggest all of the following: new Facebook Pages (with Questions integration), a ""Switch Accounts"" feature for Page Admins, a new Memories feature that chronicles photos and status updates from years past and an ""Outside World"" filter for the News Feed. What follows is a deeper look at what some Facebook users saw today. New Facebook Pages . Pages got a temporary facelift with a tab-free design -- the navigation instead being placed on the left-hand side of the Page -- that more closely resembles Facebook Place Pages and member Profiles. We also noticed that Questions were integrated into the Pages experience and that Facebook introduced a ""Switch Accounts"" feature for Page admins. We initially thought it strange that new Facebook Pages would be released without an announcement from Facebook. Commenters agreed; many of you expressed displeasure at the idea that would Facebook would overhaul Pages without notifying you of the changes first. When pressed for clarification specifically around Pages, a Facebook spokesperson shared the following statement: ""While we are always experimenting with new features internally we are not making changes to Pages right now. Organizations invest a lot of time on their Facebook Pages because millions of people find them useful everyday. We remain committed to providing ways for Page owners to customize and control the experience on their Page. If we do make changes, we will provide partners with advance notice."" Memories . Several users reported having access to a new ""Memories"" option listed below Photos in the left-hand menu on their Profile Pages. A ""Mashable"" commenter said of the feature, ""I was online during the glitch and also saw a new MEMORIES link under my profile pic. It's gone now but I did get a sneak peek while it lasted. It allowed you to look back at status updates, photos, and new friends...giving a snapshot of each year I've been on FB."" The ""Next Web"" reporter Courtney Boyd Myers saw the Memories option and described it in a similar fashion. ""It showed options for jumping to photos grouped by years: 2010, 2009, 2008, etc. with complementing information like status dated status updates, the number of friends added per year, events attended and Facebook places check-ins,"" she wrote. Memories would make for a pleasant (hopefully) walk down memory lane, so we hope this features finds its way back to Profile Pages in the near future. Outside World News Feed Filter . We also found some evidence that Facebook may still be testing a filter for the News Feed called ""Outside World."" Twitter user @casschin posted a TwitPic of the filter that shows the News Feed with a Most Recent drop-down menu that includes ""Outside World"" as a filter. ""FBHive"" first unearthed the filter back in 2009 and speculated that it was an RSS-like option for the News Feed. At the time, ""TechCrunch"" confirmed with Facebook that the filter was for internal staffers only. We're not quite sure to make of this one just yet. Photos Lightbox UI . Several commenters have said they also saw the lightbox UI for Facebook Photos, albeit with a few bugs. The photo included here comes courtesy of ""Mashable"" reader Andrew Mrozkowski. The feature was first previewed when Facebook upgraded Photos two months ago. ""Any time you click on an image anywhere on Facebook, be it in an album or in your News Feed or on a friend's Wall, you'll see a black box hovering over the rest of the screen with some minimal navigation controls and relevant social features, allowing you to concentrate completely on the image at hand,"" said ""Mashable"" reporter Jolie O'Dell at the time. Removal of ""Comment"" Button from Comment Box . Facebook may have pushed a premature update to comment boxes earlier today, according to Mashable readers. Readers are reporting that comment boxes temporarily mirrored those in the new Facebook Groups product and did not have the ""Comment"" button. Without the button, a user simply needs to hit the Enter/Return key to submit his comment. The screenshot above is merely a mock up, but these reports sound about right. Facebook consistently updates older products to match the style of its newer ones. Hat tip to Long Nguyen, Dep and the rest of our astute readers on this find.

"New York (CNN) -- The fall that seriously injured an actor in the stage musical ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"" was caused by human error, an actors' union said Wednesday. The ""Spider-Man"" company met Tuesday with officials from the union, the Actors Equity Association, and members of Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor. The union said after consulting with OSHA and the labor agency, it concluded that the fall was caused by human error. The union did not give any details but said it worked with the other agencies to develop a safety plan to address the issue. Christopher Tierney, 31, is listed in serious condition, said Bellevue Hospital spokesman Steven Bohlen. Jonathan Dealwis, a tourist from New Zealand who was in the audience, said Tierney fell ""about 6 meters,"" or about 20 feet, Monday night. Reeve Carney is the actor who plays Spider-Man, but nine people perform Spider-Man's stunts when the character is masked, according to show spokesman Jaron Caldwell. Dealwis said the accident happened near the end of the show. ""Spider-Man was on a bridge, and Mary Jane was dangling from it,"" Dealwis said. ""I think he was meant to sort of swoop over there, but he just fell off. ... The harness, you could see it just flick off his back and fly backward."" Afterward, Dealwis said, ""It just went black, and the producer came on and said we're going to pause for a moment. You could hear Mary Jane weeping."" A producer then came out and said the show was over, Dealwis said. Dealwis said the performer was wheeled away in a neck brace and was alert when he was taken to Bellevue Hospital. Rick Miramontez, another show spokesman, issued a statement confirming the performer fell from a platform and the show was stopped. ""All signs were good as he was taken to the hospital for observation,"" Miramontez said. Wednesday's matinee performance was postponed after the incident, Miramontez said, but all subsequent performances will proceed as scheduled. Show director Julie Taymor said the accident was ""obviously heartbreaking for our entire team and, of course, to me personally."" ""I am so thankful that Chris is going to be all right and is in great spirits,"" Taymor said in a statement Tuesday. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our 'Spider-Man' family, and we'll continue to do everything in our power to protect the cast and crew."" The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and The Edge, is the most expensive in Broadway history, but the production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems.

"(CNN) -- North Korea is sending an onslaught of faxes to South Korea, blaming its neighbor for tensions over a disputed island, an official said Wednesday. Earlier this month, faxes started arriving at South Korean companies, South Korean Unification Ministry deputy spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said Wednesday. The faxes blame South Korea for the November 23 artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island. Four South Koreans, two military personnel and two civilians, died when North Korea hit the island with artillery. ""Responsibility for the attack lies with the South,"" states the fax, according to Lee. ""Groups in the South should rise up against the South Korean government."" The ministry says 15 companies, consisting of two religious groups, seven trade companies, five civic groups and one media organization, reported they had received the fax. The first report of a fax came in on December 8, according to Lee. The ministry estimates that 50 to 80 companies likely received the messages, but have not reported them yet to the government. Most of the companies that received faxes had prior contact with North Korea through inter-Korean events or business operations, Lee said. All of the reported faxes were in the same format and none of them included updated information about the recent and ongoing South Korean drills, the ministry said. The faxes represent a rise in what's known in the Korean Peninsula as the propaganda war. It's taken various forms over the years, including a Christmas tree this week that left Seoul bracing for a possible backlash. South Korea lit up a major Christmas tree in an area bordering North Korea despite concerns that it may become the target of a military attack from Pyongyang. Pyongyang dismantled the tree in 2004 after the countries agreed to halt cross-border propaganda. The tree is clearly visible from North Korea. Last March, shortly after the South Korean Cheonan warship sunk, killing 46 sailors, Seoul restarted propaganda broadcasts aimed at turning North Koreans against Pyongyang. Seoul did not, however, re-installing loudspeakers at the border, after North Korea threatened to blow up the speakers. Local nonprofits started launching giant balloons packed with anti-Pyongyang fliers, small AM/FM radios, and DVDs of news broadcasts. Seoul views one of its most powerful tools in hurting the Kim regime is to inform the citizens of the hermit kingdom with news from the outside world.

"(CNN) -- The Missouri Supreme Court Tuesday overturned a lower court ruling that terminated the parental rights of a Guatemalan woman whose son, the woman says, was adopted without her consent while she was imprisoned following an immigration sting in 2007. The court ruled that the state violated its own laws in terminating the parental rights of Encarnacion Bail Romero, but the supreme court sent the case back to the lower court for retrial rather than return the boy to his biological mother. ""The trial court plainly erred by entering judgment on the adoption petition and terminating Mother's parental rights without complying with the investigation and reporting requirements ... ,"" Judge Patricia Breckenridge wrote in the court's principal opinion. ""The trial court's judgment terminating Mother's parental rights, allowing the adoption to proceed without Mother's consent to the adoption, and granting of the adoption, although supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence on the record, is reversed. The cause is remanded for a new trial in which Adoptive Parents and Mother will have the opportunity to present evidence on all claims in all counts of the petition that pertain to Mother."" Bail Romero was caught up in an immigration sting in May 2007, six months after her son was born. She was not deported, however; instead, she was imprisoned as an illegal immigrant who used a stolen Social Security number to work at a poultry processing plant. Her brother and sister took care of the boy at first, attorneys in the case said. Eventually they sought help from a clergy couple who offered baby-sitting services. When that couple asked to adopt the boy, Bail Romero said no, her attorney, Omar Riojas, said. Rebuffed, the couple introduced the boy to Seth and Melinda Moser and eventually put him up for adoption -- something the boy's biological mother said they lacked the legal ability to do. The Mosers soon asked a judge for temporary custody, said their lawyer, Richard Schnake. Bail Romero -- in prison at the time -- did not contact the Mosers or their attorney or object to them having custody, he said. After a judge granted the Mosers temporary custody, they waited a year -- rather than the six month minimum stipulated by Missouri law -- before asking to adopt the boy, Schnake says. Bail Romero said she did not fully understand what was going on and certainly did not give her blessing for them to adopt her son. In October 2008, a judge approved the adoption, ruling that Bail Romero had abandoned her child by not trying to contact the Mosers for a year. Bail Romero said she doesn't speak English and was left with no way to ask for help to plead her side. In addition to the clergy couple not having the authority to put up her son for adoption, Riojas has argued that Bail Romero was deprived of due process because she had no consular access or access to legal documents in her language. He also says an attorney who represented her at one point did not represent her well. In July 2010, a court ruled that the adoption was invalid, a ruling appealed by the Mosers, who argue that they are the only parents the boy has really known. All seven of the court's judges agreed to reverse the termination of Bail Romero's parental rights, although some members thought the now 4-year-old boy -- called Carlitos by his mother and Jamison by the Mosers -- should have been returned to Bail Romero. Breckenridge addressed those concerns in a footnote to her opinion. ""Every member of this Court agrees that  this case is a travesty in its egregious procedural errors, its long duration, and its impact on Mother, Adoptive Parents, and, most importantly, Child,"" she wrote. ""The dissenting members of this Court rely significantly on information outside the record to find that Mother has been victimized repeatedly and that her rights have been violated. The dissenting members believe passionately that custody of Child should be returned to Mother without further proceedings. That result can be reached only by disregarding the law."" The federal government intends to deport Bail Romero to Guatemala, where her other two children live, but has delayed the proceedings until this case is complete.

"(CNN) -- Captain Carlos Tevez scored twice as Manchester City went top of the English Premier League after winning a seven-goal thriller at home to lowly Wolverhampton on Saturday. The result put City a point ahead of local rivals Manchester United, who have played three fewer matches ahead of Sunday's trip to Tottenham. Arsenal stayed within two points of City after beating bottom club West Ham 3-0 in the late match, while defending champions Chelsea moved above Tottenham into fourth with a 2-0 win over Blackburn. Wolves beat City at home on October 30, and Serbian midfielder Nenad Milijas followed up his opening goal in that match with another deadlock breaker in the 12th minute. Why were EPL players snubbed in all-star selection? City leveled five minutes before halftime as defender Kolo Toure scored from close range, and Tevez made it 2-1 soon after the break as he waltzed past the Wolves defense. Kolo's brother Yaya extended the lead in the 53rd minute after starting a move in his own half before being set up by Tevez and new striker Edin Dzeko. Tevez, being watched by his two young children on a rare trip to England, headed home a cross from fellow Argentine Pablo Zabaleta in the 66th minute before being substituted. His double took him level with United striker Dimitar Berbatov as the league's top scorers on 14. Wolves hit back as striker Kevin Doyle scored a penalty just two minutes later after being fouled by former Wolves defender Joleon Lescott, and Ronald Zubar set up a tense finish in the 85th minute when his header was ruled to have crossed the line despite Nigel de Jong's attempts to clear. Robin van Persie netted twice as Arsenal piled more pressure on West Ham manager Avram Grant in a one-sided London derby. The Israeli is widely expected to be replaced by former Aston Villa and Celtic boss Martin O'Neill according to pre-match reports in Britain, and his position was left further in doubt after an 11th defeat in 23 matches. After the match, Grant applauded the West Ham fans and threw his club scarf into the crowd. West Ham had lost only once in seven previous matches, but with several key players missing rarely looked like testing an Arsenal team who took the lead in the 13th minute through Van Persie after Samir Nasri dummied a low cross by Theo Walcott. The Dutchman hit the post just after half an hour, and then provided the second goal in the 41st minute for young England winger Theo Walcott, who evaded West Ham's on-loan debutant Wayne Bridge to reach double figures for the first time in his career. Former England defender Bridge had a tough night as he also fouled Walcott for Van Persie's second goal, from the penalty spot in the 77th minute. It was a return to form for Arsenal, who lost 1-0 to Ipswich in the midweek first leg of the League Cup and face an FA Cup replay on Wednesday against another second division team, Leeds. Chelsea lifted the pressure on manager Carlo Ancelotti with a much-needed victory at home to Blackburn. Serbian defender Branislav Ivanovic ended a frustrating wait for the first goal with a low shot in the 57th minute, and his header from a corner 19 minutes later allowed French striker Nicolas Anelka to score his 12th career goal against Blackburn. The result put Chelsea two points ahead of London rivals Tottenham, having played one more match, while Blackburn remained on 28 points in 11th behind Blackpool and Newcastle on goal difference. Promoted Blackpool, who have played two fewer games, were unable to build on Tuesday's 2-1 win over Liverpool as Ian Holloway's team fell to a 3-2 defeat at West Brom. West Brom joined Liverpool and Everton on 25 points ahead of Sunday's Merseyside derby, as Nigeria striker Peter Odemwingie's 87th-minute winner ended his team's run of five league defeats. Odemwingie also netted a 37th-minute equalizer after Blackpool took an early lead through David Vaughan, while James Morrison put the home side ahead on 56 before Gary Taylor-Fletcher leveled with 10 minutes left. Stoke joined seventh-placed Bolton on 30 points with a 2-0 home victory over Owen Coyle's team, as Danny Higginbotham opening the scoring in the first half and Matthew Etherington sealing it in the second with a penalty. Wigan moved a point above third-bottom Wolves following a 1-1 draw with Fulham, who earned a point when former England striker Andy Johnson came off the bench to score in the 86th minute. The home side led through Hugo Rodallega's 57th-minute goal, and the Colombia striker also hit the post twice, but Fulham fought back to move two points clear of the relegation zone. Aston Villa manager Gerard Houllier, whose team are second from bottom ahead of Sunday's derby with fellow strugglers Birmingham, boosted his squad with the signing of midfielder Jean Makoun. The 27-year-old has joined until mid-2014 from Houllier's former French club Lyon. In Sunday's other match, sixth-placed Sunderland host local rivals Newcastle, hoping to avenge the 5-1 defeat at St. James' Park on October 31.","Manchester City take top spot in table after winning 4-3 at home to Wolves .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- As the ninth day of protests left six wounded Saturday, Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh blamed the roiling unrest on foreign agendas and a plot against Yemen's stability, according to the state-run Saba news agency. ""Everybody has the right to express his views peacefully and has the right to have a say through media as there are many democratic means for the expression of opinion,"" Saleh told Saturday's founding conference of Civil Society Organizations, according to Saba. The president said he hoped the conference will come up with recommendations to alleviate the country's current unstable situation. ""We do not want to copy others, but we shall define what we want,"" he said, according to Saba. Saleh expressed concern about violence in the coastal city of Aden, where five people have been killed since Wednesday in anti-government demonstrations, hospital and government officials said. Saleh urged non-violent change through the ballot box, according to the state-run news agency. In an attempt to quell growing discontent, Saleh, a key U.S. ally in the fight against an offshoot of al Qaeda in Yemen, has announced he won't seek another term in 2013 after being in power for 32 years. He also said he would postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for April to allow more time for discussions about reform. Yemen's situation is exacerbated by the U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda, a Shiite uprising, a secessionist movement in its once-independent south, and a looming shortage of water. Hundreds of Yemeni anti-government protesters clashed with pro-government demonstrators Saturday at Sanaa University, eyewitnesses and a local human rights group said. Gunshots were fired into the crowd, leaving at least six wounded, they said. Abdul Rahman Barman, head of the human rights group HOOD, corrected an earlier account he provided about one student supposedly being killed in the demonstration. Barman said the chaos at the scene caused the error. Instead, that student, Bassam Othman, an anti-government demonstrator, was shot in the neck and was showing improvement while in Kuwait Hospital, said his brother, Sabri. The brother accused pro-government gang members of firing upon the crowd and questioned why the riot police didn't step in and protect students who were demonstrating. ""What's happening is because of chaos and because of lack of security. Even if they were anti-government protesters, where is the security to keep us safe?"" Sabri Othman told CNN. ""The whole world is seeing this and seeing that it's wrong. These tactics that are being used means the regime here is falling apart."" Four other injured persons were hospitalized and are in stable condition, said Khulaid Mashraqi, a local doctor. Two were shot in the leg while the other two had wounds to the head, he said. ""There were 30 to 40 pro-government gang members there that were randomly shooting at us,"" said Esam Al-Hajjaji, an anti-government protester who was shot in the leg. Saturday marked the ninth consecutive day of protests in Yemen. The Yemen parliament expressed its regrets Saturday for all the victims of the ongoing violent demonstrations, according to the state-run news outlet. In a statement, the parliament condemned any outlaw sabotage and violence as well as attempts to disturb the country's security and stability. It rejected any efforts promoting ""hatred and regionalism culture"" and called on security forces to enhance stability and protect citizens, according to Saba. The parliament also called upon all Yemenis to put Yemen first among their priorities. Saba reported Saturday that an official source at the Interior Ministry has denounced some reports that security personnel in civilian clothes participated in marches. ""These fabrications are baseless and aims at insulting the security services,"" the source told Saba. The source also said security personnel are present in uniform near all rallies of pro- and anti-government marchers to maintain security and public order. The U.S. Embassy issued a statement Friday voicing concern for what it called ""a disturbing rise in the number and violence of attacks against Yemeni citizens gathering peacefully to express their views on the current political situation."" The embassy said it had received reports that government officials were present during the attacks. ""The attacks are contrary to the commitments that President Saleh has made to protect the right of Yemeni citizens to gather peacefully to express their views,"" the statement said. On Friday, supporters of Ali Abdullah Saleh hurled rocks and plunged into a crowd calling for the longtime president's ouster in Sanaa as similar protests gained momentum in other Yemeni towns. In the wake of Egyptians successfully toppling President Hosni Mubarak more than a week ago, thousands of people in several Arab nations were trying to score their own victories. On Friday, Yemenis marched to Sanaa University, where security forces and riot police tried to stay between rival demonstrators. ""After Mubarak, now it's Ali's turn,"" chanted the anti-government protesters. ""The people want the fall of the regime."" ""I'm out here today because we want the president to go and we want to make sure that he and his family don't stay in power,"" said Khalid Amer, a student. Despite concessions from Saleh, a rising tide of anger is sweeping through Yemen's youth, who say they are simply fed up with the status quo. Saleh met earlier in the week with his National Defense Council to discuss discontent in his nation. The council ""stressed all should practice their rights according to the constitution, in a peaceful way and without violence, chaos, sabotage and lawbreaking,"" Saba reported. Saleh has also been in touch with King Hamad of Bahrain, also mired in unrest. ""He pointed out that there are schemes aimed at plunging the region into chaos and violence targeting the nation's security and the stability of its countries,"" according to Saba. ""Those who commit acts of disorder and vandalism (are) simply implementing suspicious foreign agendas."" The report didn't suggest who might be behind the agendas. Journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","NEW: One protester reportedly killed actually survived a gunshot wound to neck .

"(CNN)  -- Andy Roddick denied rising Canadian star Milos Raonic his second straight ATP Tour title as he rounded off a three-set final victory in Memphis with a diving forehand passing winner. It wrapped up a 7-6 (9-7) 6-7 (11-13) 7-5 victory for the American top seed after Sunday's epic battle with his 20-year-old opponent, which lasted two hours 26 minutes. ""That's the best shot I've ever hit in my life, considering the circumstance,"" Roddick told the official ATP Tour website. ""He had a great volley there. I don't really remember much else besides the fact that I went for the ball. I hit it. I didn't really think much of it. Then I heard people cheering. I was like, 'No, there's no way that went in.' "" Raonic, who came to prominence by claiming the ATP title in San Jose last week as a wildcard entry, pushed the world number eight to the limit, leveling the match when he won a marathon second-set tiebreak. His big serving eclipsed even Roddick, pummeling down 32 aces to take his tally for the week to 129 -- comfortably a new tournament record. Mark Philippoussis set the previous best total of 106 in 2001. But Roddick's full-stretch winner on match-point in the 12th game of the decider gave him his 30th career title from 50 finals and his third victory in Memphis. ""I think I was very fortunate,"" Roddick added. ""I feel like I got outplayed. I just stuck around and kept trying. ""He's as exciting a talent as we have seen in a while. It won't surprise me if he's top-10 sooner rather than later."" Roddick is third among active players in career titles, trailing only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal after adding to his Memphis wins in 2002 and 2009. Raonic, playing just his ninth top-level tournament, climbed to 37th in the world -- making him the highest-ranked Canadian player in ATP Tour history, surpassing the 41st reached by Greg Rusedski in 1994 before he opted for British citizenship. ""It's not by any means something to be too happy with because I want to keep improving that. I want to keep progressing and developing and I think I can do a lot more,"" Raonic said. ""A lot has happened since the beginning of the year. I'm going to take the moments I need, take the time, think about it, learn from it, as well as use it to my advantage in the future."" Raonic's compatriot Rebecca Marino suffered disappointment in the women's final in Memphis, having to withdraw with a stomach injury after losing the first set 6-2 to Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova. In other tennis news Monday, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has pulled out of France's Davis Cup tie against Austria next month with a hip injury.

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Bahrain's king ordered the release of a number of prisoners and closed cases against several Shia leaders accused of plotting against the kingdom, the country's state news agency said early Tuesday. King Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa named the leaders during a national unity speech last year, leading to the arrest of several of them and the exile of several others who were out of the country at the time. The announcement clears the way for the return of Hassan Mushaimaa, leader of Bahrain's largest opposition party, the Haq Movement. Mushaimaa said he planned to arrive in Manama Tuesday evening -- amid early speculation that he would be arrested. ""I know that thousands will be waiting for me,"" said Mushaimaa, who said he planned to give a speech in Bahrain on Tuesday about the importance of national unity. Thousands more people moved into Pearl Roundabout on Monday, a presence that has taken on an air of permanence since government forces retreated on Saturday and demonstrators reoccupied the symbolic location. Tents, some of them outfitted with furniture and occupied by entire families, dot the square. The mass protests planned for Tuesday in support of calls for political reforms and other concessions and coincided with Mushaimaa's return.. ""If the people want a new system in a constitutional kingdom, I will be with them,"" he said. ""If the people just want to change the regime, I will also be standing beside them."" Mushaimaa, who has been living abroad, had previously been detained by the government for campaigning for more democratic rights in the island monarchy. In September, Bahrain said it requested Interpol -- the world's largest international police organization -- to help in arresting Mushaimaa, who the government accused of a terrorist plot to destroy state buildings and of planning a coup. But the king's decision closed the books on the case against Mushaimaa, giving him the freedom to return without fear of arrest. Meanwhile, fallout from last week's violent protests continues. A 20-year-old protester in Bahrain, who was shot in the head on Friday, has died, hospital sources said Monday. Ridha Mohammed was advancing toward the Pearl Roundabout with other demonstrators when security forces opened fire. Prior to Mohammed's death, about 10 protesters were thought to have died in five days of protests, but opposition activists say dozens more are unaccounted for. Bahrain canceled its participation in a Grand Prix auto race that had been scheduled to begin March 11. Testing for the race had been scheduled to start March 3, and protest organizers had threatened to disrupt the event. The race apparently will be rescheduled, but no date has been selected, race officials said. In announcing the decision, Crown Prince Salman said, ""We felt it was important for the country to focus on immediate issues of national interest and leave the hosting of Bahrain's Formula 1 race to a later date."" The country hopes to host the race ""in the very near future, according to Zayed R. Alzayani, chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit. State television on Monday broadcast images of pro-government demonstrators who gathered near a mosque in the capital city, holding flags and chanting slogans including ""Long live the king."" Also on Monday, Standard & Poor's downgraded Bahrain's credit rating by one step and advised investors that it believes continued protests could result in a further degradation of the country's ability to meet its financial obligations. ""We expect the demonstrations that have taken place over the past month will persist,"" the agency wrote. Protesters initially took to the streets of Manama last week to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy. But some are now calling for the removal of the royal family, which has led the Persian Gulf state since the 18th century. Young members of the country's Shiite Muslim majority have staged violent protests in recent years to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, issues they say the country's Sunni rulers have done little to address. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights says authorities launched a clampdown on dissent in late 2010. It accused the government of torturing some human rights activists.","NEW: The decision means a self-exiled opposition leader won't be arrested when he returns Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Last year was the safest in aviation history for passengers flying on Western-built jets, an international aviation trade group said Wednesday. The 2010 global accident rate was 0.61 per million flights, a rate equating to one accident for every 1.6 million flights, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). That is just below the previous historic low rate of 0.65 rate in 2006, and a ""significant improvement"" over the rate of 0.71 recorded in 2009. There were 17 plane accidents -- or hull losses, in the lingo of the business -- involving Western-built jet aircraft in 2010, compared to 19 the previous year. A hull loss is an accident in which a plane is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. There were 786 fatalities in passenger aircraft compared to 685 in 2009, IATA said. As in the past, there were significant regional differences in the accident rates, with North America having relatively low rates and Africa having the worst rate. While Africa's hull loss rate was 7.41 -- four Western-built planes crashed in Africa -- it was lower than the 2009 rate of 9.94. IATA Director General Giovanni Bisignani said African systems must improve. ""Flying must be equally safe in all parts of the world,"" Bisignani said. ""An accident rate in Africa that is over 12 times the global average is not acceptable."" He said African carriers should make use of an IATA audit system to improve safety. Runway excursions -- instances when a plane leaves the runway during take-offs or landings -- accounted for 21 percent of the worldwide accidents, IATA said, saying the number has dropped because of attention to the problem. Some of the accidents occur when planes land on wet runways; others when the aircraft approaches too fast, too high or touches down beyond the desired spot on the runway. IATA said it is working with the industry and regulators to address the issue. IATA said 2010 had the following results: . 2.4 billion people flew safely on 36.8 million flights. 94 accidents for all types of aircraft -- Eastern and Western built -- compared to 90 in 2009. 23 fatal accidents for all passenger aircraft types, compared to 18 in 2009. IATA represents some 230 airlines comprising 93 percent of scheduled international air traffic.","2010 saw 17 accidents on such airplanes .

"Sol Kerzner is the founder, CEO and chairman of the board of Kerzner International Holdings Limited (formerly Sun International). Mr. Kerzner has gained international acclaim for his imaginatively designed, high-quality resorts and business acumen. His career spans some 40 years in the hotel/resort and casino industries. He founded both of Southern Africa's largest hotel groups, played a pivotal role in the development of the tourism industries in Mauritius and The Bahamas, and continues to develop industry leading projects in unique destinations throughout the world. Sol Kerzner, the youngest of four children, was born on August 23, 1935 in a lower-class suburb of Johannesburg to Russian immigrants. In 1958, Mr. Kerzner graduated as a chartered accountant from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and immediately joined one of Durban's largest firms, where, by age 25, he was named a junior partner. Mr. Kerzner's career in hospitality began in 1960 with the purchase of The Palace Hotel in Durban. Following the success of that and a second hotel, Mr. Kerzner bought and developed an underdeveloped site north of Durban, an area with little apparent tourist appeal. Contacts from his accounting days backed his revolutionary concept of a complete resort with entertainment and sporting facilities and a variety of specialty restaurants and bars. The result was the Beverly Hills Hotel, the first five-star hotel built in South Africa. It opened in December 1964 and within a year was acclaimed as a premier resort for local and international tourists. Following the Beverly Hills, Mr. Kerzner built the 450-room Elangeni, overlooking Durban's beachfront. And, in 1969, in partnership with South African Breweries, he established the chain of Southern Sun Hotels, which by 1983 was operating 30 luxury hotels with more than 5,000 rooms. In 1975, Mr. Kerzner opened his first international hotel, Le Saint Géran, in the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. While in South Africa, Mr. Kerzner developed Sun City, the most ambitious resort development in Africa. This project included the development of four hotels, a man-made lake, two golf courses, an entertainment center with an indoor 6,000-seat arena, over 1 million hand-planted trees, a casino, two golf courses, and a series of water rides and attractions. In 1994, Mr. Kerzner made his first major acquisition outside Africa through the purchase of the Paradise Island Resort in The Bahamas. This 1,150-room resort and casino had fallen into bankruptcy. Immediately after acquiring the resort, Mr. Kerzner launched a major re-development and expansion program turning the Atlantis, Paradise Island into a 2,300-room resort and casino that also includes the world's largest man-made marine habitat, the largest casino entertainment center in the Caribbean, a world-class marina and other attractions. In 1996, Mr. Kerzner opened the Mohegan Sun gaming resort in Connecticut, occupying 240 acres on the Thames River. This was as a result of negotiating a unique agreement with the Mohegan Indian Nation. Recently, the property has been expanded through a $1 billion investment and is now one of the two largest gaming and entertainment resorts in the United States. Kerzner is extending its Atlantis brand globally with the development of Atlantis, The Palm, Dubai. An approximately 2,000 room, water-themed resort expected to open in 2008, currently being constructed on The Palm, Jumeirah, a multi-billion dollar leisure and residential development in Dubai. In the United Kingdom, Kerzner is currently developing a casino in Northampton and received a Certificate of Consent from the UK Gaming Board in 2004. Throughout his career, Sol Kerzner has been bestowed with a number of global awards, including Hotels Magazine's 2004 Hotelier of the World, Las Vegas Hotel & Restaurant Show's International Hotelier of the Year for 2005 and a lifetime achievement award from the Federated Hospitality Association of South Africa. In 1992 he was the first non-American to be admitted to the U.S. Gaming Hall of Fame. E-mail to a friend .","Kerzner was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1935 .

"(CNN) -- South Korean President Lee Myung-bak held a special meeting Thursday morning to discuss an urgent plan to evacuate South Korean construction workers in Libya. There are 1,398 South Koreans in the country working on almost 300 building sites. The presidential office tells CNN it's sending an Egypt Air plane to Tripoli on Thursday. The first flight will evacuate 260 workers and their families. Officials are looking into chartering more planes to speed up the process. Plans were also discussed to move personnel out of the country by land and sea routes. Lee told ministers to ""use all possible measures for Koreans and Korean construction workers' security."" An emergency response team is already on the ground helping workers of 24 construction firms operating in Libya. A spate of attacks and violent break-ins have been reported at some construction sites in Libya amid growing anti-government protests and violence. An attack Monday left 17 workers injured. Two workers from Bangladesh suffered serious wounds after being stabbed, according to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. The Middle East is a substantial and important market for South Korean construction companies. Firms have been working in the region for around three decades. Projects in the Middle East are worth $257 billion, according to the International Contractors Association of Korea. The association says ongoing projects in Libya are worth $36.4 billion. Companies are asking the South Korean government not only to ensure the safety of their workers but also to give support if the violence is prolonged and work is stalled indefinitely. Exports from South Korea to Libya are also expected to be hit hard. Almost 600 companies rely on business in Libya, exporting goods such as ships, cars and heavy industries, a lucrative market worth $1.4 billion last year. A poll taken by the Korea Trade Investment Promotion Agency estimates exports will take an $18.7 million hit this year. The South Korean government has advised its citizens to cancel all nonurgent travel to Libya. Lee also asked his government to ""closely monitor the oil price and the impact to the economy."" Lee stressed the importance of domestic energy conservation.","There are 1,398 South Koreans in Libya working on almost 300 building sites .

"(CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf defended Pakistan's role in the fight against terrorism amid criticisms that it falls short on that front. ""Pakistan has always been accused of not doing enough. But I totally disagree with this statement. Pakistan is doing enough,"" Musharraf said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" A private White House report to Congress, obtained by CNN last week, used unusually tough language to suggest the ally is not doing nearly enough to confront the Taliban and al Qaeda. The blunt language contradicted public comments by the Obama administration that Pakistan is working hard to crack down on militants. The report notes that from March to June, the Pakistani military ""continued to avoid military engagements that would put it in direct conflict with Afghan Taliban or [al Qaeda] forces in North Waziristan. This is as much a political choice as it is a reflection of an under-resourced military prioritizing its targets."" Musharraf said that if critics want to point out deficiencies in North Waziristan, they should limit their comments to just that region. ""But don't generalize the statement that the army is not doing enough. They've suffered over 2,000 casualties. What do you mean by not doing enough?"" he said. Pakistan has its problems, he said, but should not be blamed for its effort. ""We must understand the problems, but what hurts Pakistan and every leader in Pakistan is when they are blamed. Everyone in the world starts blaming them, while we are suffering casualties, we are suffering hundreds of people dying from bomb blasts and suicide bombs, and yet we are the rogues,"" Musharraf said. Musharraf has been in self-imposed exile in London since he left office in 2008. But he said he wants to return for a presidential run in 2013, because he sees suffering in Pakistan and doesn't see a political party offering a solution.","The Pakistani military is ""doing enough"" to fight terrorism, Musharraf says .

"(CNN) -- Virender Sehwag smashed a career-best one-day innings of 175 as India opened the 2011 Cricket World Cup with a convincing 87-run victory over co-hosts Bangladesh in Dhaka on Saturday. Opening batsman Sehwag put on 203 for the third wicket with Virat Kohli, who was unbeaten on 100, as India compiled 370-4 in the allotted 50 overs -- the fifth-highest total in tournament history. Bangladesh made a game effort in reply but could manage only 283-9, crucially losing five wickets while scoring just 47 runs in the final 10 overs of the match. Sehwag, who hit 14 boundaries and five sixes in his 140-ball knock, matched the 175 not out by compatriot Kapil Dev in 1983 which is the fourth-highest score in World Cup matches. Bangladesh excited to host Cricket World Cup . ""It was a good start for the team, I have said this is a revenge game and we have won,"" the 32-year-old told reporters. ""I have said before Bangladesh are not good in Tests, but they can compete in ODIs -- but today they could not. Special thanks to my physio for helping me, I was carrying a couple of injuries and they got me ready for this game."" After Bangladesh won the toss and chose to field, Sehwag opened the Indian innings with veteran Sachin Tendulkar -- the sport's highest scorer in one-day and Test formats -- who scored 28 from 29 balls before being run out. Girls got game in cricket-crazy Bangladesh . Gautam Gambhir, who usually opens for India in five-day Tests, made a run-a-ball 39 before falling at 152-2 in the 24th over, bringing Koli to the crease. The 22-year-old reached three figures for the fourth time in one-day internationals, needing only 83 deliveries as he hit eight fours and two sixes. Bangladesh looked well-placed at 188-2 but then opener Tamil Iqbal fell for his team's top score of 70 as the second of Munaf Patel's four wickets. And when captain Shakib Al Hasan was caught in the deep by Harbhajan Singh for 55 off 50 balls in the 40th over, it signaled the end of the home team's resistance. Spinner Harbhajan picked up a wicket and a runout, while Patel finished with figures of 4-48 off his 10 overs to give India a winning start to their Group B campaign. The seven-team pool also includes cricket heavyweights South Africa, England and the West Indies. The Group A schedule begins on Sunday as New Zealand take on African minnows Kenya in Chennai, India, and the third of the tournament's hosts Sri Lanka play Canada.

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to strip $450 million from funds slated for a controversial program to build an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter second engine, a next-generation aircraft development program that has been riddled with cost overruns and labeled unnecessary by critics. The amendment to strip the funds passed 233-198 with bipartisan support.  It was added to a bill that would fund the federal government for the remainder of the current fiscal year.  Neither the House nor the Senate has the passed the full spending package yet. President Barack Obama has urged Congress to eliminate funding for the development of the second engine of the Joint Strike Fighter.  House Speaker John Boehner, however, is a key supporter.  The vote was a setback for the Ohio Republican. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told members of the House Armed Services Committee earlier Wednesday that he considers the program ""an unnecessary and extravagant expense, particularly during a period of fiscal contraction.""

"(CNN) -- ""127 Hours"" isn't just the name of James Franco's Oscar-nominated film, it also could describe the length of time he waits before delving into a new career. Musical producer; college lecturer, bar owner; Walmart greeter -- which of these titles won't Franco be adding to his résumé in the coming months?

He shunned the limelight, nabbed a Golden Globe for the ""James Dean"" TV movie, appeared with Robert DeNiro in ""City by the Sea"" and headlined a string of little-seen dramas, including ""Tristan & Isolde"" and ""Annapolis."" ""It was death,"" he has said of his career path at the time. ""I didn't want to act anymore. It was death doing the things I was supposed to be doing. I couldn't make those movies anymore. ... I had the conversation with my manager like, 'If this is what it's gonna be, I can't do this anymore.' So, it wasn't like the answer was, 'Hey! Go do a bunch of crazy stuff!' I had to figure out how to change what I was doing. I had to figure out that I had to believe in my own taste. Not believe in what you should do. Believe in what I liked and it's OK."" Apparently, those likes included books, bongs and bedpans: Franco went back to college, made the 2008 stoner comedy, ""Pineapple Express,"" and took a role on ""General Hospital"" as serial killer Franco. The soap-opera gig was an unheard move for a successful film actor -- seriously, can you picture Christian Bale doing ""All My Children""? -- but by 2010, you'd be hard-pressed to define Franco as a film actor anyway: He was modeling in a wet T-shirt for a Gucci fragrance ad, had made a documentary about ""Saturday Night Live,"" published the short-story collection ""Palo Alto"" and unveiled the sex-and-violence-themed performance-art piece ""The Dangerous Book Four Boys"" at a New York gallery. Then, shortly after unleashing those whoppers, Franco pulled out the really big guns and fired off a new string of head scratchers. He premiered a ""Three's Company"" art installation at Sundance -- while wearing a Suzanne Somers wig, no less -- and is now turning the old sitcom into an off-Broadway play and a movie. He's hosting the Oscars and also hosting the after-party! At his new bar! Where he'll sing! He's returning to ""General Hospital,"" writing and directing three screenplays, and he'll appear on Broadway in ""Sweet Bird of Youth."" And wait ...  he's producing a musical at Yale and will be both the subject and instructor of a Columbia College Hollywood course on film editing. You heard correctly: He. Is. A. College. Course. While Franco has been criticized -- and even skewered on ""Saturday Night Live"" -- for his mindboggling multitasking, that may be exactly what he wants. After all, an artist's job is to inspire debate and discussion, and Franco -- much like Lady Gaga, minus the telephone hats, platform boots and meat dresses (for now) -- certainly keeps the public talking as well as guessing with his every move. ""Some people say, 'Yeah, that guy will do anything. What's he going to do next?' But it doesn't mean that I don't believe in the projects that I'm doing,"" he has said. ""You can do the crazy projects. Just be smart about it."" Well said, Franco. Now could you tell me which aisle home goods are on?","James Franco is adding musical producer, college lecturer and bar owner to résumé .

"(Mashable)  -- UPDATE We've just heard from the NHL, who tell us: ""The NHL is not in discussions with YouTube to stream live games. The NHL has not had conversations with the Google spokespeople mentioned in the Bloomberg report."" YouTube may be a hot bed for lip dub videos and life-casting teens, but soon sports fans could find a good reason to flock to the site: YouTube is reportedly in talks with the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League to broadcast games live. Last year, YouTube announced that it would begin live-streaming Indian Premier League cricket matches, a venture that was apparently very successful. According to Business Week, the games brought in 55 million visits from more than 250 countries. Gautam Anand, Google's director of content partnerships for Asia Pacific, recently said that YouTube plans to show more live sports, but declined to elaborate on the particulars of talks with the NBA and NHL. Google is apparently also talking with other pro sports leagues, as well as soccer leagues in Europe. ""It's fair to say that there will be a lot more appealing sports content you'll see on YouTube,"" Anand said. ""We have ongoing conversations with pretty much everyone."" By offering such content, YouTube and Google can boost their ad revenue, seeing as how viewers would be spending more time on the site. Lately, we've been seeing YouTube seemingly getting more serious about being an entertainment hub, rather than a forum for cat videos. Just the other week, it was rumored that YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar will be building out the site's recently instated talent program (last July, the video-sharing site announced its YouTube Partner Grants Program to ramp up quality content) by offering big-name stars their own YouTube channels. In addition, parent company Google recently acquired Widevine, an on-demand video service known for its multiplatform DRM and adaptive streaming technologies, and the web has been buzzing for months about the possibility of it acquiring web video production company, New Next Networks.

"(CNN) -- A municipal police officer was shot and killed late Thursday while standing guard at a local government booth inside a mall in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, police said Friday. The officer was gunned down by three people who were trying to rob the booth, which is a place where local residents can pay their annual homeowners tax, municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. ""As of right now, we do not believe this had anything to do with the ongoing drug violence in the city,"" he said. ""The suspects were detained and are being processed."" Photos from the scene taken just after the officer was shot showed mall patrons running for cover. The gunmen ran away, but police caught them, local journalist Arturo Chacon said. Also, around 4 a.m. Friday, a man who was being chased by gunmen in several cars drove to a municipal police station in Juarez looking for help, Sanchez said, leading to a 15-minute gunfight. ""It would be wrong to say the attack was on the police officers,"" he said. ""An injured man looking for help was being chased, and he came to us. That's when we encountered the gun battle."" No officers were injured, and the shooters fled. Since October 2010, at least 26 municipal police officers have been killed in Ciudad Juarez, Sanchez said.

"(CNN) -- While most eyes will be on the likes of Tiger Woods, Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer at the World Match Play this week, Italian teenager Matteo Manassero will be making his own slice of history in Tucson. At the tender age of 17 years and 310 days, he will become the youngest player to line up at a World Golf Championship event as he surpasses Japan's Ryo Ishikawa, who was 18 and 153 days old when he debuted in last year's tournament. Manassero, the European Tour's 2010 rookie of the year, faces a tough task on Wednesday against U.S. Ryder Cup veteran Steve Stricker, at 44 the second-oldest player in the elite 64-man field. But having finished tied for 36th in his only other U.S. appearance at the Masters last April, he is expected to hold his own against nine-time PGA Tour winner Stricker, the event's 2001 champion. Manassero has already won his first senior title, at the 2010 Castello Masters, and his rise has impressed fellow young star Rory McIlroy -- who reached the Match Play quarterfinals as a 19-year-old in 2009. ""Yeah, I played Matteo this morning and it's hard to believe he's in this tournament as a 17-year-old. It's pretty incredible, really,"" the Northern Irishman told the PGA Tour website. ""And there's so many young guys coming through, all guys that are 21 and younger. It's great for the game of golf, it makes it a little more exciting."" McIlroy is up against American Jonathan Byrd in the 16-man Gary Player bracket, which also sees Germany's world No. 2 Kaymer take on 19-year-old South Korean Noh Seung-yul, the 2010 Asian Tour money leader. Top-ranked Englishman Westwood plays Sweden's 2007 winner Henrik Stenson, like Manassero-Stricker in the Bobby Jones group along with Ishikawa's match against South African Charl Schwartzel. World No. 4 Phil Mickelson faces Australian Brendan Jones in the Ben Hogan bracket, where defending champion Ian Poulter takes on American Stewart Cink. Woods is a three-time World Match Play champion but has not won the tournament since it moved to Dove Mountain's Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in 2009. The American, who has dropped to third in the rankings after a winless past year, will play Denmark's Thomas Bjorn in the Sam Snead group, which also features two-time runner-up Paul Casey. The Englishman, beaten in last year's final by compatriot Poulter, is drawn with Australian left-hander Richard Green. Casey's conqueror in 2009, Australia's two-time winner Geoff Ogilvy, faces three-time major champion Padraig Harrington of Ireland in the same quarter of the field. Each elimination match is played over 18 holes, with the winners progressing until Sunday's final -- which is worth $1.4 million to the champion, out of a total prize pool of $8.5 million.","Matteo Manassero will become youngest golfer to play at a World Golf Championship event .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Two leading Ivory Coast banks closed their doors this week, raising fears that a money shortage will worsen the crisis in the West African nation. Mounting security concerns prompted BICICI and Citibank to suspend operations Monday. Paris-based BNP Paribas, parent of BICICI, issued a statement saying it has done its best to serve clients despite the instability in Ivory Coast. ""Over these past few days, however, legal uncertainty has significantly increased,"" the statement said. The bank, it said, ""is therefore no longer able to ensure legal and accounting security for its clients. It has thus decided to temporarily halt the bank's activities until further notice."" Ivory Coast has been in crisis since a late November election that ended in dispute. The international community has pressed incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo to relinquish power to Alassane Ouattara, who foreign powers say won the election. The political standoff in the country has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002. More than 33,000 people have fled to neighboring Liberia since the crisis began; another 20,000 have been internally displaced, U.N. agencies estimate.","Security concerns prompted the banks to close .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- The Mumbai High Court rejected the appeal Monday of the only surviving gunman from the 2008 three-day terror attack on the Indian financial capital. A trial court handed down a death sentence last year for Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, on charges of murder, conspiracy and waging war on India. The city's High Court upheld his conviction and sentence, lawyer Ejaz Naqvi told reporters. The court, however, dismissed the prosecution's appeal against the acquittal of two Indian nationals that police had accused of conspiracy in connection with the November 2008 strikes on Mumbai, said Naqvi, who represented one of them. The high court upheld the acquittal Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed for a lack of ""corroborative"" evidence, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nika. He said authorities would petition the Supreme Court next. It was not immediately clear if Kasab too planned to file a fresh appeal to the country's highest court in New Delhi. Convicts on death-row in India reserve the right to challenge the sentencing in the nation's Supreme Court. They can also file a mercy petition with the country's president if the Supreme Court also turns down their plea. Kasab's lawyer, Farhana Shah, told reporters that her client would be briefed about options available to him. It will then be up to Kasab to make a decision about an appeal, she said. He would have 30 days to file his appeal, Shah said. During the raids, 10 men attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. More than 160 people died in the three-day coordinated attack. Kasab was photographed holding an assault weapon during the attacks. Indian forces killed nine suspects in the attack. Their bodies were embalmed and kept in a hospital morgue as some local Muslim groups refused them a burial in their graveyards, saying the attackers were not true followers of Islam. An Indian official in Maharashtra state, where Mumbai is located, said a burial took place in January last year. He did not give the date or the exact location of what he described as a secret funeral. India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. The group denied responsibility. The Mumbai attack derailed a fragile peace process between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan for about 15 months. This year, the two nuclear-capable nations announced resumption of their fully-fledged dialogue after a series of high-level meetings over the past one year.","Kasab was sentenced to death last year on murder and other charges .

"(CNN) -- A commercial flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Minneapolis was aborted shortly after takeoff Sunday morning because of an indicator warning that one of the aircraft's engines had been damaged, according to airline officials. Delta Air Lines Flight 1846 returned to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport within minutes of its 7:45 a.m. takeoff without incident or injury to any of its 119 passengers or six crew members, according to an airline spokesman. All were rescheduled to take another flight to Minnesota later Sunday afternoon, said Delta spokesman Anthony Black. Black said Delta mechanics confirmed that parts of the twin-engine Boeing 737-800 had been damaged, though the spokesman did not know which ones. ""Incidents like this are extremely rare, but the crew knows the protocol and it's clear the pilot took appropriate action,"" Black said. Broward County Aviation Department spokesman Greg Meyer told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV that pieces of what appeared to be parts of the jet's damaged engine were recovered near the airport. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said an initial inspection of the aircraft revealed a ""contained failure."" ""Engine turbine blades exited the rear of the engine, they did not penetrate the engine cover,"" wrote Bergen in an e-mail to CNN. Bergen said the FAA is continuing to investigate the incident.

"(CNN) -- Lee Westwood and Rory McIlroy's decision to skip the Players Championship at Sawgrass in May has been defended by their manager Andrew Chandler. World number one Westwood and Northern Ireland's rising star McIlroy are giving the tournament, dubbed the ""fifth major"" a wide berth, saying it did not fit their schedules. Both have opted to take up European Tour membership in 2011, meaning they can only play three events on the PGA Tour outside of the majors. Chandler told CNN that moving the PGA Tour's flagship tournament from just before the U.S. Masters to a slot in May had prompted the decisions of his star duo. ""I would think when it was played at the end of the March it was getting to be the fifth major,"" said Chandler. ""Moving it to the middle of May has made it about the 10th most important tournament in the world. ""It isn't a priority for them as they would rather win a major or a world golf championship event,"" he added. The absence of current world number one Westwood from the TPC has been seen as a snub to the PGA Tour, but Chandler says it is purely down to the calendar. ""They cannot play every week,"" he said. McIlroy has also denied reports of a rift with PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem for abandoning the U.S. circuit after only one year as a full-time member. He wrote on his Twitter blog: ""For everyone who is interested, the reason I'm not playing TPC this year is because I've never thought the golf course has set up that well for me. ""Hence, two missed cuts in two years. I have no sort of vendetta against Tim Finchem or the PGA Tour; I love playing in the U.S. and have always found the people very welcoming.""

"(CNN) -- Foreigners are making a run to get out of volatile Libya, with thousands hustling to the Egyptian border and foreign governments scrambling to help their citizens. Around 12,000 people have crossed into Egypt from Libya, officials say, in an effort to flee the violence engulfing the North Africa nation. ""There is no security over there,"" said Esat Abubakr, an Egyptian living in Benghazi said after he arrived in Sollum, Egypt. He described widespread violence and a climate of fear with no security. He said people drove to the border and then walked across. ""Every Egyptian I know is trying to come back to Egypt,"" he said. Lt. Col. Raouf Ezzat, an Egyptian military doctor overseeing medical care of the fleeing people, said the army is permitting only Egyptian citizens and Libyans married to Egyptians to enter Egypt. But he said anyone wounded would be treated.  ""Any patient that comes to me, whether Egyptian or Libyan, I will treat them,"" he said, adding that any wounded Libyan who arrived at the border asking for help would be allowed to enter and be treated. Ten Egyptians with minor injuries arrived Tuesday from different parts of Libya, but authorities were expecting and preparing for large numbers of injured people. About 30 military doctors and 80 to 100 ambulances were stationed at the border, where an operating room was set up and 1,000 units of blood were en route. The French Foreign Ministry said that it had sent three planes to Libya to help repatriate French citizens and that its embassy in Tripoli was helping to get citizens to the airport. The Dutch military was responding as well. A Dutch Defense Ministry spokesman told CNN that ""a Dutch military plane has been authorized to land in Tripoli today to evacuate about 100 Dutch nationals"" and a NATO commander said a Dutch frigate is heading there as well. Britain said its citizens who don't have ""a pressing need to remain in the country should leave by commercial means if it is safe to do so."" Britain also ""is looking urgently into options for possible charter flights."" The government was advising Britons who want to leave Libya but can't buy tickets online ""to travel to the airport carrying sufficient cash to buy tickets. Problems with internet connections in Libya mean that electronic payments may not be accepted."" The United States was unable to move any Americans out of Libya on Tuesday, said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. ""We are working on this with Libyan authorities,"" he said. The State Department issued a travel alert for non-essential staff to leave the country, an order affecting 35 employees and their families. There are other American citizens in Libya who might want to leave; some of them might be employees of energy companies that have suspended operations. Of the several thousand U.S. citizens in Libya, most are dual nationals; those solely with U.S. citizenship number about 600, Crowley said. The U.S. State Department was not able to land charter aircraft in Tripoli to fly out U.S. citizens because Libyan authorities did not give permission for those aircraft to land, said a senior administration official not authorized to speak for attribution. The State Department was chartering ferries to take travelers from Tripoli's As-shahab port to Valletta, Malta on Wednesday, the official said, adding, ""Tomorrow the question will be if they let the ferry dock. If that happens, our people will flow out."" Crowley said the airport in Tripoli remained open in ""challenging"" circumstances. International carriers, he said, were making more seats available for departure. Oil companies, such as Total, BP, OMV and BP, said they would or planned to evacuate people some staff and families. Libya's official Jana news agency reported that airport authorities said Libyan airspace was open to civilian aviation and was operating normally, contrary to the rumors broadcast by ""conspiring media channels."" One Air Malta official -- who declined to be identified in keeping with company policy -- said thousands were waiting at Tripoli's airport for a flight out. British Airways and BMI flights in and out of Tripoli have been canceled. Both companies said they were monitoring the situation closely. The British Foreign Office confirmed the cancellations and said KLM also canceled its Tuesday flights. It said Turkish Airlines, Air Malta, Alitalia, Austrian and Egypt Air ""are operating flights but these are all full at present."" Air Malta said a Malta-bound flight finally left Tripoli International Airport after it had been delayed because of heavy congestion there. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey couldn't land its planes and was sending a ship and two ferry boats for evacuations. ""Since there was no one in the control tower (at Benghazi airport), landing was not allowed. It was also not possible to land in Tripoli,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on Tuesday pushed for talks between Thailand and Cambodia to end deadly clashes that have erupted over a temple along the border. The issue ""can only be addressed bilaterally,"" said Marty M. Natalegawa, who is also the Indonesian foreign minister.  He added that he has the impression, after visiting Phnom Penh and Bangkok, that there is an overwhelming commitment on both sides to ""address their issues through peaceful means, through dialogues and negotiations."" The border skirmishes, which started Friday, have killed five people, including members of the military and civilians, a statement from ASEAN said, adding that each nation accuses the other of firing first. Thailand's official news agency, MCOT, reported Tuesday, ""Since the fighting erupted Friday, one Thai soldier was killed, 25 were wounded and one civilian died in the clashes."" The report added that Cambodia on Tuesday ""handed over a Thai soldier captured during the cross border clash."" Cambodia's official news agency, AKP, reported Tuesday that ""Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen has sought the United Nations' intervention in arranging a buffer zone"" at the border area and wants to make sure the fighting does not expand to other parts of the border. The U.N. Security Council on Monday expressed ""grave concern at aggravation of tensions between Cambodia and Thailand"" and said it was willing to hold an emergency meeting requested by Cambodia, but first wanted to wait for regional mediation efforts by the Indonesian foreign minister. An official Thai report said the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday, but skirmishes continued after. The clashes stem from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. The building sits on a cliff in Cambodian territory, but the most accessible entrance to the site is on the Thai side. In a letter to the United Nations over the weekend, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said that in addition to the human toll the fighting was taking, the temple had suffered damage. Conflict over the Preah Vihear site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was ""an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture."" But Thailand says the 1.8-square mile (4.7-square kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French occupation of Cambodia. In July 2008, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site, meaning the U.N. believes the place has outstanding universal value.","ASEAN official believes there is overwhelming commitment for a peaceful resolution .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- As the United Nations was preparing Friday to debate a resolution branding Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank as illegal, Palestinian officials called Obama administration efforts to head off the vote as evidence that American policy is ""biased"" and ""seriously wrong."" ""This is a moment of truth because very clearly the Americans so far have placed their strategic alliance with Israel and the legal cover for Israeli violations above their own interests,"" said veteran Palestinian legislator and PLO executive committee member Hanan Ashrawi. ""The Americans have very clearly demonstrated to Palestinians, to Arab public opinion, and to world public opinion that they are biased to the point of destruction,"" Ashrawi told CNN, echoing an argument made by many Palestinian officials. The resolution being brought to the Security Council by the Palestinians and other Arab states presents a political dilemma for the White House as it tries to navigate policy in a quickly evolving Middle East region. The Obama administration has been critical of Israeli settlement construction in the past, but has not gone as far as to call it ""illegal"" and anything short of an American veto of the resolution is bound to deepen tensions with Israel and stir up considerable congressional opposition. On Friday, the U.S. vetoed Friday the resolution. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, said the United States agrees about ""the folly"" of continued Israeli settlement activity, but ""we think it unwise for this council to attempt to resolve the core issues that divide"" Israelis and Palestinians. Obama's first U.N. veto . The previous day, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the U.S. does ""not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement activity"" and that it is ""corrosive not only to peace efforts and a two-state solution, but to Israel's future itself."" President Barack Obama on Thursday called Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the resolution and speak about alternatives to a Security Council vote. Among the options that have been floated, American and Palestinian officials said, was a Security Council presidential statement which is weaker than an actual resolution. Other ideas included stronger future statements from the international peace group known as the Quartet, and the possibility of a Security Council fact finding mission to the region. After the call, Abbas called an emergency Friday meeting of the PLO executive committee to discuss the issue but early indications suggest that the Palestinians will not agree to shelf the resolution. ""If they keep trying to manipulate and water down a resolution to become a statement, and they start selling us used goods again it's not going to work,"" Ashrawi said. ""The legitimacy and strength of any leadership comes from the people not from American approval or disapproval and the Americans . Since the breakdown of American-brokered talks with Israel in September over the issue of settlements, the Palestinian Authority has been pursuing a policy aimed at unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state by September based on borders from 1967 and in recent months has won recognition from a number of South American countries. Both United States and Israel oppose the unilateral efforts insisting that all issues in the conflict must be dealt with through direct negotiations. Sabri Saidam, a senior official in Abbas' Fatah party, said Palestinians were determined to press ahead with the resolution and said the administration needed to adapt to changing regional circumstances. ""Obviously the Untied States has to weigh its options, now amidst all the revolutions that are made and engineered by the people I think the voice of sense should prevail. ... Unless the international community pressures Israel to abide by its will by the will of the international community, it will be hard to see how the entire middle East could come to a rest.""","NEW: U.S. vetoes proposed Security Council resolutuion declaring Israel settlements illegal .

"(RollingStone.com) -- Lady Gaga gave Rolling Stone an advance preview of four songs from her upcoming album ""Born This Way"" an hour before the first show of the final leg of her Monster Ball tour in Atlantic City. Though Gaga's people were quick to point out that these were not the final mixes, the tracks certainly sounded like polished, finished recordings. Here's a track-by-track rundown of what we heard backstage, as well as what she played from the new record in concert. ""Judas"" Currently scheduled as the second single from the album, ""Judas"" is a classic Lady Gaga pop banger with three huge hooks, a thumping house music breakdown and a vocal part that borrows a bit of Rihanna's distinctive cadence. Gaga has written about falling for the wrong guy before in ""LoveGame"" and ""Bad Romance,"" but this time around she's a bit less dark and dramatic. There's a bubbly sweetness in her voice as she sings ""I'm just a horny fool / baby it's so cool / I'm still in love with Judas, baby."" ""Edge of Glory"" This one sounds crazy in print -- it's a massive power ballad with heavy club beats that features Clarence Clemons of the E Street Band wailing on his saxophone (Clemons also plays on ""Hair"") -- but somehow it all seems totally natural when you actually hear it. There's an element of cheesiness to it, but it's totally captivating and incredibly catchy. If any of these new Gaga tunes demands to be a big fat hit, this is it. The inclusion of Clemons is an inspired touch that amplifies the song's Eighties stadium rock vibe, but his actual performance is amazing and ranks among the best of his career. Photos: Lady Gaga's Best Looks . ""Scheiße"" A remixed version of this number was used in a recent runway show by fashion designer Thierry Mugler. The album version doesn't have the same hardcore European house flavor, but it's definitely the tune most likely to bring back memories of early-Nineties dance crossover hits by C&C Music Factory, Snap and RuPaul. The opening of the song -- in which she flatly intones ""I don't speak German, but I can if you like"" -- is fierce, but the song is saved from being a slight novelty by a soaring chorus that vaguely recalls Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger."" Photos: Lady Gaga at the 2011 Grammys . ""Hair"" ""Hair"" is another inspirational song in the mold of ""Born This Way,"" but it's a bit weirder, mixing the yearning romantic melodrama of Pat Benetar's ""We Belong"" with the hard industrial metal edge of Broken-era Nine Inch Nails. The lyrics are essentially about embracing one's hairstyle as the ultimate expression of their identity, climaxing with Gaga triumphantly declaring ""I am my hair!"" in its huge sing along chorus. An anthem for hair salons everywhere. Photos: Lady Gaga's Fashion Icons . ""You and I"" Gaga didn't share the studio version of this theatrical rock ballad, but she did perform it in her concert later in the evening. This one has been part of her Monster Ball setlist for months now, and at this point it's already a crowd-pleasing showstopper. Assuming that the album recording will have more or less the same piano-centric arrangement, ""You and I"" will provide a necessary break from the high energy beats on the other tracks. Watch her performance of the song from ""The Today Show"" back in July below. ""Born This Way"" This is the Number One single in the country, so you've probably heard this one by now. This was the first time Gaga has played the song in concert, but it's already the ideal conclusion to her show, ending the night with a giddy communal celebration of personal empowerment and self-acceptance.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A least one person was shot dead and 55 others -- including four police -- were wounded Wednesday when private security guards and Iraqi security forces opened fire on hundreds of demonstrators outside the governor's office in the eastern city of Kut, health officials said. Police officials in Kut, about 63 miles (110 kilometers) south of Baghdad, tell CNN that nearly 2,000 demonstrators demanded the resignation of Wasit's provincial governor, Latif Hamed, accusing him of corruption. Some of the protesters tried to force their way inside the governor's office, prompting private security guards to shoot at them, police said. After the shooting, the situation escalated rapidly and the protesters became angrier, Kut police said. Dozens of protesters stormed the governor's office again and destroyed furniture inside, then set the building on fire. Another group of demonstrators went to the governor's house and set it on fire. Kut police tell CNN that Hamed was not in the city when protesters attacked his office and his house. Another group of protesters stormed the provincial council building and set it on fire, forcing some council members to flee the building from a rear gate, police said. Initially, Iraqi security forces used water cannons and batons on the crowds of demonstrators but later opened fire when protesters started attacking government buildings. Health officials said the four Iraqi police officers were wounded when protesters hurled stones at them. A few hours later, more Iraqi army troops entered the city and imposed a full curfew. The demonstration was to warn the government and lawmakers to conduct reforms and end the corruption ""that destroyed this country,"" said one protester, an older man. ""Look at our city,"" another protester said. ""It is a ruined city. The government has not done anything to improve the services here or find jobs for our sons."" ""This government is only looking (out) for its interests and not the interests of Iraqi people,"" another said. The protesters were heard shouting, ""Down with (Prime Minister Nuri) al-Maliki, down with the corruption, down with thieves."" Others were carrying a banner that said, ""Eight years of suffering, where are your promises?"" referring to the Iraqi government that took power after Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003. On February 3, another rally was held in Kut as citizens protested against the lack of basic services, unemployment and corruption and called for improvement of food rations in Wasit province, a predominantly Shiite province about 68 miles (110 kilometers) south of Baghdad. The demonstrations are the latest in a series across Iraq, as protesters are inspired by uprisings in the Middle East. In Falluja, hundreds of protesters walked toward the city council building and the mayor's office on Tuesday, demanding the resignation of the mayor and the head of the city council because of corruption and their inability to provide basic services to the people. Iraqiya state TV, for the first time since the demonstrations started across the country more than two weeks ago, broadcast video footage of the Kut demonstration and urged people to protest peacefully and not to turn to violence.

To own ""Pictures Don't Lie,"" go to Amazon.com or download it on iTunes. (CNN Student News) -- Program Description: ""Pictures Don't Lie: A Black in America Special"" examines the hazy legacy of legendary photographer Ernest Withers, who helped advance the civil rights movement with his stunningly intimate black-and-white images. Withers was everywhere: in Dr. King's hotel room for strategy sessions, in the courtroom of the Emmett Till lynching murder trial, behind the scenes at the Memphis sanitation strike before Dr. King was assassinated. Now, just three years after his death, the reputation of the man dubbed ""the original civil rights photographer"" is in question. Withers may have led a double life as a paid FBI ""racial informant."" Caught in the middle of the firestorm are the children of Ernest Withers, who are disputing the charges and fighting to open the namesake museum that will display his historic images. The Withers children are speaking out for the first time with CNN anchor and special correspondent Soledad O'Brien. We will also speak to leaders of the civil rights movement who were allegedly spied on by Withers to hear their reactions. Do they believe the accusations? Do they feel betrayed? And how common was the FBI's practice of employing racial informants? During this month of reflection, the timing couldn't be better to debate this conflicted character's place in civil rights history. Recommended Grades: 11-12, college . Before-Viewing Discussion Questions: Use these questions to initiate discussion with your students before they watch ""Pictures Don't Lie."" 1. What was the American civil rights movement? In your opinion, what impact has this movement had on today's society? 2. What do you think might have been the potential risks and benefits of joining the civil rights movement? 3. Some people in the civil rights movement advocated non-violence, while others preferred a more militant approach. What other ways can you think of to try to enact social or political change? How do you think that policy makers and the public might respond to each of these strategies? 4. If you could interview one of the leaders of the civil rights movement, what questions would you ask? What lessons would you want these leaders to pass on to your generation? Post-Viewing Discussion Questions: Use these questions to talk about the program and to promote critical thinking after students have watched ""Pictures Don't Lie."" 1. Who was Ernest Withers? What role did he play in Memphis society and in the American civil rights movement? 2. What are some of Withers' images that are seen in the documentary? Have you seen any of these photographs before? What do you think that Andrew Young means when he says that, ""It would not have been the movement without the pictures""? In your opinion, what might be the value of Withers' photographs for American history? 3. What were some of the historical events that Withers witnessed and photographed? According to the program: How was he able to get some of his famous shots? Why did the civil rights leaders give him access to their meetings and events? 4. Who were the ""Invaders""? How did this group's approach to civil rights differ from the movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Young? Why do you think that some civil rights groups chose non-violent action as a form of protest, while other groups decided to act more militantly? 5. Why was Withers accused of working for the FBI? According to the program, why did the FBI use informants from the black community? Why do you think that some people in the black community helped the FBI? What impact do you think that the leaking of information might have had on the civil rights movement? Explain. 6. What are some of the theories presented in the documentary for why Withers might have informed for the FBI? Which of these theories, if any, do you believe? Explain. Do you think that Withers sold information to the FBI? Why or why not? 7. Why do you think that the FBI monitored the civil rights movement? What challenges did the agency face in doing so? What is your opinion of the FBI's surveillance of the movement? 8. What do you think might be the potential advantages and disadvantages of using informants for surveillance versus using other methods (e.g., wiretapping)? In your opinion, should the federal government monitor individuals and groups that may be opposed to its policies? Why or why not? 9. How do some of Withers' family members and contemporaries respond to the accusation that Withers gave information to the FBI? What is your reaction to their statements? 10. In your opinion, what impact has the accusation that Withers was an informant for the FBI had on his legacy? 11. How would you assess Ernest Withers' role in the civil rights movement? Media Literacy Questions: You've no doubt heard the expression ""A picture is worth a thousand words."" In your opinion: How does a picture or image tell a story differently from words? In what ways might a photojournalist shape your perception of a news event? What images do you remember from events that happened during or before your lifetime? Why do you think that these images are especially powerful? Learning Activity: . Pose this question to students: Do you think that Ernest Withers did more to promote or to undermine the civil rights movement? Before students answer, have them work in groups to review the evidence presented in the program and conduct online research as well. Assist groups in organizing their research into a chart or other visual aid that presents the two sides to the question and the evidence for each side. Have groups share their findings. Then, generate a discussion about the information students found and what methods they used to assess it as credible or not credible. Ask for volunteers to share their conclusions about what they have seen, heard and read, as well as how the information gathered helped them to formulate opinions. Finally, have each student produce a video essay in response to the initial question that was posed to the class. Assess the essays on composition, grammar, media literacy and production.

"(CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Wednesday that U.S. intelligence officials should be questioned over their handling of ""Curveball,"" an Iraqi defector whose now discredited claims on weapons of mass destruction helped fuel the Bush administration's drive to war in 2003. It has become clear over the years that ""the source called Curveball was totally unreliable,"" Powell said in a statement to CNN. ""The question should be put to the CIA and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) as to why this wasn't known before the false information was put into (a key intelligence estimate) sent to Congress, the president's State of the Union address and my February 5 presentation to the U.N."" Powell, in an address to members of the United Nations Security Council in February 2003, said the U.S. government had ""first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels."" ""The source was an eyewitness, an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities,"" Powell said at the time. ""He actually was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998. Twelve technicians died."" Two months later, the invasion of Iraq began. No biological weapons, no germ labs, and no weapons of mass destruction were found. The defector, Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, has admitted in an interview with Britain's Guardian newspaper that he lied to help bring down Saddam Hussein's regime. ""I had the chance to fabricate something, to topple the regime,"" he said. ""I did this, and I am satisfied, because there is no dictator in Iraq anymore."" When Alwan spoke to CNN in 2008, he said, ""I never told anyone Saddam Hussein was producing weapons of mass destruction."" At the time, intelligence sources told CNN that Alwan had claimed that Iraq had a secret bioweapons program. But now, Alwan admits that after he was granted asylum in Germany in 2000, he used his training as a chemical engineer to concoct for his debriefers a story of Iraqi WMD production. Although the CIA was not given a chance to interview Alwan directly, and German officials had questioned some aspects of Alwan's story, his assertions were included in the material provided to Powell for his U.N. presentation. Tyler Drumheller, who was the CIA's chief of European operations at the time, agrees that the ""Curveball"" information was not well-enough vetted. He says he had reservations at the time about relying on it, but that when he asked for direct CIA access to Alwan through the German intelligence service, he was rebuffed. A representative of Germany's intelligence service declined to comment. Drumheller claims top Bush administration officials were too willing to believe Alwan's story ""because that was the only piece of intelligence they had that really fit what the administration was looking at."" Former President George W. Bush declined through a spokesman to comment. Representatives for former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and the DIA did not reply to CNN's inquiries. Former CIA director George Tenet, who was Drumheller's boss, wrote in his memoirs that ""perhaps some people's recollections of 'if only someone had listened to me' have become sharper than reality."" Without naming names, Tenet said that ""concerns about Curveball did not get disseminated far and wide through the agency as they should have been."" Former Homeland Security adviser Frances Townsend says that the U.S. government should seek Alwan's extradition and prosecution, for ""intentionally lying and deceiving the U.S. government."" ""It absolutely makes my blood boil,"" she told CNN. Not all observers are accepting Alwan's claim that his goal in spinning his WMD tale was to free the people of Iraq from Hussein. ""He told the story because he wanted to get out of a refugee camp in Germany,"" said Bob Drogin, author of a book about the episode. ""He wanted to get his wife out and bring her to Germany, he wanted to get citizenship, and he wanted a Mercedes Benz. And he got all of those things."" But in his interview with the Guardian, Alwan said he had already won asylum before he spoke to German intelligence about weapons programs in Iraq, and that telling them his story did not win him a life of ease. Alwan insisted he is proud of the role he played in the toppling of Hussein. In the video of the interview posted online, he said that if he had it all to do over again, he would say the same thing ""because I wouldn't want that regime to continue in our country."" CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Pam Benson contributed to this report .","Colin Powell says U.S. intelligence officials should be questioned over their handling of ""Curveball""

"(Mashable)  -- Popular restaurant recommendation app Urbanspoon has just launched a brand new version of its app, complete with a full redesign and the ability to rate and upload photos of your dishes. Version 1.17 of the Urbanspoon iPhone app [iTunes link] puts its focus on the food you eat. Like Foodspotting, you can take a picture of your meal and upload it. You can then write a specific recommendation for that dish and post it on Urbanspoon. The IAC-owned service also updated its navigation. It has de-emphasized the ""shake to find a random restaurant"" home screen in favor of a menu system that lets you browse restaurants, see what your friends are recommending and reserve a table (a beta feature available in Seattle, Los Angeles and New York City). The focus on photography and dishes makes the app richer. It will have more data on not just the best places to eat but the best things to order at these locations. The upgraded app puts it in direct competition with several heavyweights though, including Yelp and OpenTable. Moreover, the photos feature pushes Urbanspoon onto Foodspotting's turf. Urbanspoon has the vast resources of InterActive Corp at its disposal, while Foodspotting has raised just $750,000. This could prove to be an interesting battle. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund marched 13 points clear in the German Bundesliga on Saturday with a 2-0 win at home to St. Pauli. Coach Jurgen Klopp's team later saw defending champions Bayern Munich move up to second place on goal difference above Bayer Leverkusen, who host lowly Stuttgart on Sunday. Paraguay striker Lucas Barrios scored his 10th goal this season to put Dortmund ahead six minutes before halftime, while an own-goal from Ralph Gunesch four minutes after the break left St. Pauli just five points above the relegation zone. Barrios netted for the first time this year after doing well to control Nuri Sahin's cross, and his ball across goal forced Gunesch to turn the ball into his own net with Robert Lewandowski waiting behind him to score. It was a welcome return to winning ways for Dortmund, who had drawn three of the team's first five games of 2011. Bayern Munich warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League final rematch against Inter Milan with a morale-boosting 3-1 win over Mainz, who stayed in fifth place. Bastian Schweinsteiger scored the first header of his Bundesliga career nine minutes into the first half and Thomas Muller made it 2-0 five minutes into the second, with Dutch winger Arjen Robben involved in setting up both goals. With 13 minutes left, Muller helped Germany striker Mario Gomez to score his 27th goal in all competitions this season for Louis van Gaal's team, who travel to Italy seeking revenge for May's defeat in Madrid. Tunisian striker Sami Allagui headed his second goal in successive games in the 83rd minute, but it was too late for Mainz -- who won in Munich in September. Fourth-placed Hanover moved four points clear of Mainz with a 3-1 win over struggling Kaiserslautern, with a goal in each half from Jan Schlaudraff and another just before the interval by Mohammed Abdellaoue. The defeat left visiting Kaiserslautern third from bottom on goal difference behind 2009 champions Wolfsburg, who lost 2-1 at sixth-placed Freiburg. Wolfsburg led when Turkey striker Tuncay Sanli helped set up fellow new signing Patrick Helmes, but substitute Stefan Reisinger leveled just before halftime and Papiss Demba Cisse's 69th-minute winner was his 16th goal this season. Hamburg claimed seventh place above Nuremberg -- 3-0 winners over Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday -- following a crushing 4-0 victory at home to Werder Bremen. Croatian striker Mladen Petric gave Hamburg the lead three minutes before halftime, then two bad second-half mistakes by Per Mertesacker gave Peru striker Paolo Guerrero a double on the counter-attack before Anis Ben-Hatira sealed victory near the end. The defeat left Bremen just a point above Wolfsburg and Kaiserslautern. Cologne came from behind to draw 1-1 at ninth-placed Hoffenheim, moving three points clear of the drop zone as Youssef Mohamad's 69th-minute equalizer canceled out an own-goal by teammate Milivoje Novakovic soon after the interval.","Borussia Dortmund return to winning form with a 2-0 victory at home to St. Pauli .

"(CNN) -- Standing 6 feet 3 inches (1.9 meters) tall and with a shaved head, fashion designer Ozwald Boateng often cuts a dash as much as his tailored suits. Boateng's eponymous fashion lable has been worn by Hollywood's A-list celebrities. He's married to a former model and his suits have been worn by Hollywood A-listers on Oscars night. Yet he remains in touch with his North London roots where he grew up, and to Ghana, his parents' homeland. ""They taught me the value systems,"" Boateng told CNN. ""We have a very strong culture, people tend to like to intellectualize about everything, so we have a lot of red tape, we talk a lot but not a lot gets done. I'd like to see a lot more get done, but most importantly the people are good people."" In 1997 Boateng became the youngest tailor and the first black designer to have a shop on London's exclusive men's tailoring street, Savile Row. In 2003 he was made creative director of men's wear for Givenchy. While he deals in a world with high-end clients and celebrities, he is committed to setting a good example to young people on how to be a successful business person and to improving the lives of people in Africa. Using his business acumen and passion for Africa, he set up the Made in Africa Trust in 2006 to help promote self-sufficiency and new businesses in countries across the continent. ""It's not easy because you're still dealing with infrastructure and sometimes governments are not that ready for new ways of thinking. But the thing is, it is changing and what you have to bear in mind is there are 53 countries in Africa so you know, we're not saying you've got all 53 right (on the) first hit, but I think you could probably get 20 right,"" he said. His love of designing will always remain, he says, as will helping people across Africa to tailor their own lives for the better. ""This is what I love, designing clothes and creating, that is just me. The whole mission for Africa is out of frustration and need. It is just not moving enough. I'm frustrated getting off a plane. I don't want to see open drains, I don't want to see a road that takes 10 years to build, I want to be able to go there and open one of my stores.""

"(RollingStone.com) -- Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello spent Monday at the Wisconsin protests, performing acoustic songs at a rally and delivering a fiery speech to the thousands inside of the capital rotunda who are protesting Governor Walker's attempt to end the right of state employees to collectively bargain. ""What's happened so far might be the most inspiring 24 hours of my life as an activist,"" Morello tells Rolling Stone. ""I've never seen this kind of outpouring of unapologetic, steel-backboned support for union causes in the United States. The Madison police were delivering bratwurst to the protesters inside the capitol, and the kids were thanking them. It was unbelievable."" Rolling Stone: Tom Morello rocks Wisconsin protesters . At a freezing cold rally outside of the capital, Morello was joined by Rise Against frontman Tim Mcilrath, Wayne Kramer of the MC5 and Boston folk group Street Dogs. The show mixed classics like Neil Young's ""Ohio,"" Bob Marley's ""Get Up, Stand Up"" and Morello's driving acoustic version of Rage Against the Machine's ""Guerilla Radio."" ""No matter what Gov. Walker, the Mubarak of the Midwest, says, this land is your land,"" Morello said before singing Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land."" ""Never give up and never give in!"" Rolling Stone: Tom Morello's top ten protest anthems . If Governor Walker's bill passes, it would effectively destroy Wisconsin's civil servant unions; many fear that other Republican-controlled states would attempt to follow suit. ""I come from a coal-mining town in central Illinois where everybody was union,"" says Morello. ""For almost 30 years, my mom was a public high school teacher in Libertyville, Illinois. I grew up with a firm belief that the leverage we have as working people is through the union. It's the only counterweight to the raw greed of corporate power. For the past 22 years, I've been a union man in L.A. as a member of the Professional Musicians Local 47."" Rolling Stone: Rage Against the Machine rock for immigrants' rights in California . After the rally, Morello entered the packed Capitol rotunda, which had been occupied for the past week, grabbed a bullhorn, and made one of the most rousing speeches of the day. ""This is what they do in times of economic crisis,"" Morello said. ""They think people aren't paying attention, that they can just sneak through this legislation that would rob us of decades, centuries of social progress. We didn't pick this fight. [Governor Walker] tapped us on the shoulder and said 'let's fight.' And now we're gonna knock his legislative teeth out."" Reporting by Patrick Doyle .

"(CNN) -- It's often assumed that older people generally aren't very digitally savvy -- but new research from Pew indicates that older people are becoming about as skilled online as younger ones. According to the 2010 Generations report from the Pew Internet and American Life project, ""The biggest online trend (we found) is that, while the very youngest and oldest cohorts may differ, certain key internet uses are becoming more uniformly popular across all age groups."" The study found that internet users aged 34 and older are more likely than those age 33 and younger to engage in several online activities, including visiting government sites and getting financial information online. These online activities are becoming more uniformly popular across all age groups: e-mail, search engines, getting health information, following the news, researching or making purchases (including travel reservations), online banking, supplying reviews or ratings, donating to charity, and downloading podcasts. And get ready: Your grandmother might soon try to friend you on Facebook. Even though younger people are significantly more likely to use social networking services, Pew reports that ""the fastest growth has come from internet users 74 and older: social network site usage for this oldest cohort has quadrupled since 2008, from 4% to 16%."" Some online trends are creeping down the age ladder, too. According to Pew, it used to be mostly older adults who searched for online health information. But now this has become ""the third most popular online activity for all internet users 18 and older."" Wireless net access is definitely not the exclusive province of youth. Like the recent iPass mobile workforce study -- which put the median aged of a mobile-enabled worker at 46 -- Pew found that 55% of people aged 46-55 access websites or other digital media or services via a laptop, cell phone, or other internet-connected mobile device. That figure drops to 46% for people aged 56-64, and 33% for people aged 65-73. The bottom line is, don't assume you know how digitally savvy someone is based on their age.

"(CNN) -- The nation's most energy-efficient National Christmas Tree doesn't appear to be the nation's most energy-resistant one. The 42-foot Colorado blue spruce snapped at its base during high winds Saturday morning in Washington. Sustained winds at 25 miles per hour and wind gusts up to 50 miles per hour swept through the area and snapped the tree 4 feet above the ground, the National Park Service said in a statement. By 5:30 p.m., less than seven hours later, the tree was reduced to mulch by work crews. The tree was trimmed over the holidays with green-hued LED lights and snowflake ornaments in an area called The Ellipse directly between the south lawn of the White House and the Washington Monument. The first family lighted the tree, a tradition going back 87 years, on December 9, 2010, as blues legend B.B. King, Maroon 5, and others performed at the ceremony. It stayed lit each evening until New Year's Day. According to the National Park Service, decorations are provided by sponsoring organizations from every state and are placed in a protective plastic globe to protect them from bad weather. The Park Service has identified a successor tree and will announce this spring when it will be brought to the Ellipse, the statement said. The spruce had been in its current location for more than 32 years. It came from the Myers family farm outside York, Pennsylvania, the Park Service said. ""The tree had been planted and watered by the Myers' grandchildren. When the tree was 6 years old it had been planted in the Myers' front yard as a Mother's Day gift for Mrs. Myers. After discussions with the NPS horticulturists, the Myers agreed to let the tree go to become the nation's Christmas tree.""","High winds snapped the tree Saturday morning .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona restored their lead at the top of La Liga on Sunday night with a hard fought 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao at the Nou Camp. The league leaders made the perfect start after their midweek defeat to Arsenal in the Champions League with David Villa scoring after four minutes, latching onto a knock down from Daniel Alves. Despite dominating possession, Barca failed to find the net again in the first half and were made to pay five minutes after the break when Bilbao were awarded a penalty as Sergio Busquets brought down Fernando Llorente inside the box. Andoni Iraola duly converted the spot kick beating Jose Manuel Pinto who was standing in for the injured Victor Valdes. But Barca's persistence finally paid off as Alves grabbed his second assist of the night laying the ball off for Messi who finished with customary aplomb. The win restores Josep Guardiola team's five-point lead over rivals Real Madrid who beat Levante on Saturday. Mourinho milestone as Real Madrid win . Villarreal missed the opportunity to close the gap on Champions League rivals Valencia (who drew 0-0 with Sporting Gijon on Saturday), as they played out a 1-1 draw against bottom-of-the-table Malaga. A win would have sent Villarreal up to third place but an 82nd minute strike by Uruguay's Sebastian Fernandez cancelled out Marco Ruben's 36th minute goal. The result means Villarreal remain in fourth, two points behind Valencia. New Osasuna coach, Jose Luis Mendilibar got off to a flyer as his side thrashed Espanyol 4-0 in Pamplona. Iranian midfielder Javad Nekounam opened the scoring after 15 minutes and doubled Osasuna 10 minutes into the second half as he slotted a penalty. Lola (81st minute) and Fernando Soriano (88th minute) completed a resounding win which lifts Osasuna out of the bottom three. Despite losing their fourth successive league game, Espanyol stay in sixth place but are now nine points off a top four finish. Deportivo La Coruna left it late to grab a point at Almeria. Argentine Pablo Piatti had put Almeria ahead three minutes into the second half, but Deportivo's goalkeeper Dani Aranzubia scored a dramatic 95th minute equalizer. The draw keeps Almeria in 19th place and three points from safety. Sevilla move up to seventh after a 1-0 win over Hercules. Croatian Ivan Rakitic's 21st minute goal proving enough to secure three points and relieve the pressure on coach Gregorio Manzano. An 89th minute penalty by Pablo Pinillos secured Racing Santander a crucial win over at Getafe.

"(CNN) -- Mobile devices are only as good as the networks that serve them. But too often, a mobile user will purchase a new smartphone with a two-year carrier contract, only then to learn that the phone gets lousy reception at home, work or school. That's why the first -- and obvious -- question consumers should ask themselves when considering a mobile phone is this: Which carriers get the best service in the places where I spend most of my time? The trouble: This isn't always an easy question to answer. Yes, carriers all provide coverage maps on their websites that show where their networks are supposed to reach -- theoretically, based on cell phone tower locations. But, in reality, signal strength and network speed can vary substantially due to terrain, structures, the typical amount of data-hungry wireless devices on the network in a given location, and other factors. When looking for a new carrier, some people attempt to gauge the local quality of a network by finding local customers of various carriers and asking them how many signal bars they generally see on their phones. However, this isn't necessarily reliable, since (as I wrote last year) signal bars are largely meaningless, and they're sometimes misleading. This is where crowdsourcing can help: Mobile users can work together to create crowdsourced maps that show how well wireless networks really perform in specific locations. Here are two projects that you can actually contribute to, by sending data from an app on your smartphone: . Open Signal Maps . This project, by Staircase3, collects data via an Android application. As you are out and about, this application runs in the background, monitoring the signal strength of your carrier's network. If you have data-sharing turned on for the app (you can turn it off), your data are stripped of identifying information and uploaded to Staircase3's servers. Aggregate user data are displayed on maps on the Open Signal Maps site. I've installed this app on my Droid Incredible, and it's interesting and useful. In addition to showing the direction and location of the tower my phone is connected to, and signal strength, it allows me to conduct network speed tests. This is important because both signal strength and network speed play important roles in the quality of voice calls and data connections. According to the Open Signal Maps blog, ""A high (signal strength) does not guarantee a good connection. You can be communicating really well with the tower but the tower might be choked up -- it might be dealing with so much network data that you get terrible speeds."" Also, being able to easily conduct your own network speed test can indicate whether your carrier might be ""throttling"" your data connection, as Verizon recently said it will start doing to the top 5% of its customers by data usage. The coverage maps on the Open Signal Maps site appear to offer data for major and minor carriers in most regions. They don't offer an iPhone app, because of differences in how the iOS operating system captures signal data. A BlackBerry app is under consideration. RootMetrics . This project collects data via an iPhone app. Android and BlackBerry apps are coming, the site says. The maps on the RootMetrics site allow you to compare the performance of AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile networks. Smaller carriers, such as US Cellular or MetroPCS, are not shown. These maps are a bit simpler to interpret than the Open Signal Maps, and they have user-friendly features. For example, they express network speed as the number of seconds it takes to upload or download a song. RootMetrics users also can view their own personal map with a history of signal strength and network speed. Both of these projects are most useful in major metro areas where lots of people use smartphones. They encourage people to use their apps in other locations to help make their maps more complete. Although people who use feature phones (the next step down from smartphones, used by nearly 75% of U.S. mobile users) cannot run the apps for these projects, the data on these maps still might be useful for selecting a local carrier. In the big picture, projects like these could help hold carriers accountable for the network speeds they advertise, an issue that's likely to become especially contentious in the next few years as carriers struggle to deliver high-speed wireless broadband to a fast-growing number of data-sucking phones. As Mashable notes, ""Finally, we'd have a source of real-world information to counteract the questionable maps we see from wireless providers.""

"(CNN) -- Internazionale moved up to second place in Italy's Serie A with a dour 1-0 victory over Cagliari on Saturday that put the defending champions within two points of rivals AC Milan. Defender Andrea Ranocchia was credited with the only goal in the seventh minute in an unconvincing warm-up for Wednesday's Champions League final rematch with Bayern Munich. AC Milan, beaten by English club Tottenham in Tuesday's last-16, first-leg tie in Europe's top club competition, will look to bounce back with victory at Chievo on Sunday. Napoli can regain second place with victory at home to Catania. Inter caught the Cagliari defense unawares for the early winner, as a quickly-taken free-kick by Samuel Eto'o set up a chance for Goran Pandev, whose blocked shot was returned goalwards by on-loan Morocco midfielder Houssine Kharja and into the net off Ranocchia. It was the 23-year-old Italy international's first goal since joining from Genoa last month. Gattuso says sorry for Jordan 'head-butt' It proved to be a match of few clear-cut chances as Inter missed the creativity of playmaker Wesley Sneijder, who was rested after injuring his groin in Wednesday's 2-1 win over Fiorentina. Coach Leonardo also left out Brazil defender Lucio ahead of German club Bayern's visit to the San Siro. ""We struggled a bit but the main thing is that we got the three points,"" Inter fullback Maicon told the club's  website. ""AC Milan? We're just concentrating on ourselves, but having us breathing down their necks won't make things easy for them. And now we can focus on the Champions League."" The defeat left former Italy coach Roberto Donadoni's Sardinians in ninth place, 17 points off the lead. Seventh-placed Palermo's hopes of qualifying for the European Champions League were dented by a 1-0 defeat at Bologna in Saturday's only other Serie A match. The visitors played the final half-hour with only 10 men after Santiago Garcia was booked for the second time, and Bologna took advantage as substitute Daniele Paponi headed the only goal in the 90th minute. The result left Palermo five points behind fourth-placed Lazio, who host bottom club Bari on Sunday. Bologna took a big step towards safety, moving 10 points clear of the relegation zone.","Inter Milan give the city the top two places in Serie with 1-0 win over Cagliari .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal were held to a 1-1 draw by English League One side Leyton Orient in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday. Arsenal, who recorded a famous 2-1 win over Barcelona in the Champions League in midweek, fielded a weakened side for Sunday's fixture and looked to have done enough to win when Tomas Rosicky headed home in the 53rd minute. But Leyton Orient battled on and were rewarded when substitute striker Jonathan Tehoue beat two defenders before striking a low drive through Manuel Almunia's legs in the 88th minute. The winners of the replay at the Emirates stadium will face Manchester United at Old Trafford in the quarterfinals. In the other FA Cup ties played Sunday, Manchester City thrashed Nott's County 5-0 in their FA Cup fourth round replay match at Eastlands. Paul Ince's League One side had managed to hold their more illustrious opponents to a 1-1 draw at Meadow Lane in January, and for a time held their own against Roberto Mancini's men. It took City almost 40 minutes to break the deadlock when Patrick Vieira opened the scoring when he headed in at the near post from a David Silva corner. Vieira added a second just before the hour to all but kill off any hopes of a revival by County. But City weren't finished and further goals were added by Carlos Tevez -- who rounded Nelson in the Notts County goal before sliding the ball home -- in the 84th minute. Edin Dzeko added another in the 89th minute and Micah Richards made it five in injury time. The win sets up a fifth round tie with Aston Villa. Bolton Wanderers have booked their place in the quarterfinals after recording a 1-0 victory at Fulham. Croatian striker Ivan Krasnic got the decisive goal after 19 minutes with a volley past Mark Schwarzer. Bolton will face Birmingham at St Andrews for a place in the semifinals. Sunday's only English Premier League match saw the Midlands derby between West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers finish in a 1-1 draw. Wolves were heading for all three points after Jamie O'Hara had put them ahead after 39 minutes. But Carlos Vela's pounced on a loose ball to tuck away an injury-time equalizer for Roy Hodgson's team. The goal denied Wolves the chance to move off the bottom of the table, while a point lifts West Brom one point above Wigan in 17th place.","League One side Leyton Orient hold Barcelona conquerors, Arsenal to 1-1 draw in FA Cup .

"(CNN) -- Vincenzo Montella has been appointed as the new coach of Italian club AS Roma after Claudio Ranieri handed in his resignation. Roma acted quickly after the departure of Ranieri, who quit after his side were beaten 4-3 by Genoa on Sunday, having led 3-0 six minutes into the second half. Montella, 36, scored 118 goals in 267 Serie A matches and netted 84 for Roma during a ten-year stint with the club. He joined Ranieri's coaching staff in 2009. ""AS Roma have, today, given first team duties to Mr Vincenzo Montella until the end of the current season,'' the club said in a statement. ""We are certain he will be able to put the team's quality together with his professionalism, dedication, enthusiasm and experience."" Ranieri offered his resignation shortly after Roma's defeat at Genoa -- their fourth in a row. They lost at home to Ukrainian side Shahktar Donetsk in the Champions League on Wednesday and head for the second leg trailing 3-2. After much speculation about Ranieri's future, AFP reported that the 59-year-old had told Italian news agency Ansa: ""I've always thought about the good of Roma and after a game such as today's I believe it's right to give a signal. ""After the final whistle I went into the changing rooms to thank the team and I decided to hand in my resignation,"" the Italian reportedly said. The club confirmed his departure in a statement on Monday: ''AS Roma announces it received yesterday evening the resignation of Mr Claudio Ranieri as coach of the first team. ""Following this move, the financial contract with Ranieri, whose deal was coming to an end on June 30, 2011, has ended by mutual consent. Roma wishes to thank Claudio Ranieri for the professionalism shown and the work done.'' Elsewhere, Raul Tamudo's goal was enough to help Real Sociedad past Mallorca and move them up to seventh in the Spanish Primera Liga. Tamudo struck on 55 minutes as he nodded a Daniel Estrada cross into the net. Mallorca stay 11th after their defeat. In England, West Ham powered through to the quarterfinals of the FA Cup with an emphatic 5-1 win over second division Burnley. The London club will now face Stoke in the last eight of the competition. Striker Carlton Cole scored twice while German midfielder Thomas Hitzelsperger also found the net on his debut.","Roma appoint Vincenzo Montella as their new coach to replace Claudio Ranieri .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Andy Roddick will take on Canadian rising star Milos Raonic in the 50th ATP Tour final of his career in Memphis on Sunday. The American overcame 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in Saturday's second semi, winning 6-3 6-4 to give himself a chance of winning his third title in the U.S. city and his 30th overall. World No. 8 Roddick triumphed in an hour and 35 minutes against the Argentine, who played only three events last year due to his wrist problems. Former world No. 4 Del Potro made two second-round exits in Australia before reaching the semifinals in San Jose last weekend. The 20-year-old Raonic won that event for his breakthrough ATP title in just his seventh start on the circuit, and is now set to become the first player from his country to reach the top 40 in the men's rankings. ""It's amazing to be in two finals in a row. After you get the results, everything comes with it, like the rankings. But the thing I'm most proud of is my level,"" he told the ATP Tour website after beating American fourth seed Mardy Fish 6-4 4-6 6-3 in the opening semifinal. The final will be a clash of big servers, with the 6ft 5in Raonic taking his tournament-leading tally to 97 aces as he beat the conqueror of defending champion Sam Querrey. ""He's got all the serves that anyone else that I've ever seen does. I wasn't familiar with his game at all; I hadn't seen him play live,"" Fish said. ""From the waist down he has the strongest legs of anyone I've seen. You can tell he still has some growing to do in his upper body, and it's a scary thought to think he's got ways to improve."" Roddick, playing in his first tournament since losing in the last 16 of the Australian Open in January, followed up Friday's hard-fought 4-6 6-3 6-4 victory over fellow former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt in Memphis in which he needed seven match-points. Raonic's sixth-seeded compatriot Rebecca Marino will seek her first WTA title against Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova in the Memphis women's final. In France, Marin Cilic saved a match-point before reaching the final of the ATP Marseille Open with a 6-2 1-6 7-5 win over Russian third seed Mikhail Youzhny on Saturday. The Croatian world No. 28 will play Swedish top seed Robin Soderling in Sunday's final, having been 5-3 down on his own serve in the deciding set when he escaped defeat. World No. 4 Soderling beat Youzhny's 129th-ranked compatriot Dmitry Tursunov 7-5 6-1. Meanwhile, Caroline Wozniacki celebrated her return to the women's world No. 1 ranking by reaching the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships with a 7-5 6-3 win over Serbian sixth seed Jelena Jankovic on Saturday. The 20-year-old Dane will play two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in Sunday's final, after the Russian beat Italy's world No. 18 Flavia Pennetta 6-4 6-4 in the day's second match.","Andy Roddick beats former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro in semis .

"(CNN) -- Whether Moammar Gadhafi stays or goes, the turmoil-wracked country is likely to be in for more of a rough time, two Libya experts told CNN Monday. ""Whichever way this goes, I think there's going to be a good amount of chaos,"" said Diederik Vandewalle, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College. During his 42 years in power, Gadhafi has limited the formation of political and other institutions, Vandewalle said. ""All civil society organizations have been eviscerated by the regime,"" he said. In a telephone interview Monday night, he predicted more bloodshed if Gadhafi steps aside. ""We could see some tribal uprisings"" as competing groups seek a share of Libya's oil wealth, he said, describing the likely scenario as ""not very pretty."" But, he added, oil exports will likely continue after ""some"" interruption. ""It would be in the interest of all parties that oil keep flowing,"" he said, dismissing as unlikely any apocalyptic scenario in which Libya would descend into civil war. The current uncertainty will likely be decided in the next few days, he predicted. ""It seems to me that we're in an endgame here,"" he said. ""The big question is how much bloodshed we're going to see."" He called the violence against unarmed civilians ""extraordinary, but not surprising from a regime that's truly entrenched."" There are few candidates in the wings to replace Gadhafi -- ""no younger leadership able to assume that mantle of leadership,"" he said. But Gadhafi's imminent departure is not a foregone conclusion, he added, putting the odds at ""80% go, 20% stay."" Ronald Bruce St John, who has written seven books on Libya, said Gadhafi's reign appears to be drawing quickly to a close. ""He's losing support by the hour from critical people in his regime,"" he said. But St John said it was unlikely that the next leader would emerge from the military, since Gadhafi has long sought to keep the institution at arm's length. ""Though he was an army officer when he came to power and was supported by the military and all the original members of the Revolutionary Command Council were from the military, he has, from the beginning, evidenced a great distrust for the military,"" St John said. ""He recognized it as the most likely power to overthrow him."" As a result, Gadhafi has routinely rotated commanders ""so no one established a base of support."" Unlike Egyptians, who were seeking a more liberal system, Libyans want a new system, St John said. Accomplishing that will mean ""a great deal of chaos in the short term,"" he predicted. ""If he does leave, I think we'll see the tribal leadership of Libya, probably through social leadership committees, trying to come up with some kind of a nonviolent solution,"" he said. St John noted that two major tribes had already withdrawn their support of Gadhafi. One of them, the Warfala tribe, has long been a supporter. The other, the Zuwayya, is one of the larger tribes of eastern Libya and is located near the terminals from where oil is exported. ""That's a significant loss,"" he said. Though another strongman could emerge, St John predicted instead that a nationwide network of ""social leadership"" committees set up by Gadhafi in 1993 and composed primarily of traditional leaders and tribal leaders would seek to take charge. Gadhafi had tried without success to eliminate the more than 100 tribes in Libya in an effort that lasted from 1969 to 1980, St John said. So in 1993, the leader made a dramatic move -- reinforcing the tribal system and recognizing its leaders as important by creating social leadership positions, St John said. The leaders were given power at the local level as well as such ""goodies"" as housing and scholarships for their tribal members, he said. But the gifts came with a catch: ""In turn, you must recognize that you're in charge of your tribe,"" St John said. ""If they step out of line, we'll go to you."" If Gadhafi leaves power, ""those tribal leaders will try to find a way to put together some kind of a new government,"" he predicted. ""I think you'll see the tribes being the ones that will, in the short term anyway, try to find a way through the obvious chaos that's going to occur."" Are you there? Share photos, video . Not everyone predicts rough sailing. Sayyid Idris Al-Senussi, an exiled Libyan opposition figure who said his great-uncle was overthrown by Gadhafi, predicted that any transition would go smoothly. ""If Gadhafi departs, there will be no problem,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview from Washington. ""There will be a national council, which would be represented by all the tribes and all the Libyans from all different walks of life."" He said the opposition already has a constitution and a flag ready for use in the event of Gadhafi's departure. ""We will have a democracy,"" he predicted. ""After this experience, I don't think they'll allow anybody to single-handedly rule."" Despite an exile that has lasted four decades, Al-Senussi said he would return to Libya ""in a heartbeat."" But Dartmouth's Vandewalle said Al-Senussi and his relatives would have little hope of gaining a position of power upon their return. ""It's about as likely that they'll get back in power as the Marcoses in the Philippines,"" he said, referring to the family of the former president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, who in 1986 fled a military rebellion and moved to Hawaii.","""I think there's going to be a good amount of chaos,"" says one Libya expert .

"(RollingStone.com) -- All British rock stars eventually make their version of ""Led Zeppelin III"" -- the album where they look to the history and mythology of England for inspiration. Usually, this means pastoral celebrations and druids dancing around the maypole. (Hark, minstrel! Is that a bustle in the hedgerow?) But Polly Jean Harvey, as always, does things her own way, so there's no celebration on ""Let England Shake."" Even as she sings, ""Take me back to beautiful England,"" she focuses on war, imperialism and bad sanitation. ""Let England Shake"" sounds a world apart from the introspective piano confessions of Harvey's last solo album, 2007's ""White Chalk."" For England, she holed up in a rural 19th-century church, accompanied by longtime collaborators like John Parish, Mick Harvey and producer Flood.

"(CNN Student News) -- September 9, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Cleveland, Ohio • Detroit, Michigan • Long Island, New York . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz with your morning announcements. One: CNN Student News is on, and you're gonna love it. Two: The CNN Teachers' Lounge is open, and you're gonna hear more about it in just a few minutes! First Up: Economic Plans . AZUZ: First up, though, the economy, and a pair of plans that both aim to give it a needed boost. The first one comes from President Obama. During a visit to Cleveland, Ohio yesterday, he laid out his ideas to help the economy. They include cutting taxes for businesses that buy new equipment or do new research; and spending money on the country's infrastructure, things like roads and power programs. He also talked about some of the things that have happened since he took office in 2009. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Our economic plan has invested in badly needed infrastructure projects over the last nineteen months. Not just roads and bridges, but high-speed railroads and expanded broadband access. Altogether, these are projects that have led to thousands of good, private sector jobs, especially for those in the trades. Mr. Boehner and the Republicans in Congress said no to these projects, fought them tooth and nail. AZUZ: You heard President Obama mention a Mr. Boehner there. That would be Republican House Minority Leader John Boehner. He's from Ohio. He says the president's economic plans so far haven't worked, and Mr. Boehner doesn't think the new ideas will work either. He's pushing a different plan to boost the economy, one that comes from Republican leaders in Congress. This one has two main points. The first is to cut government spending. Congressman Boehner says that's caused more debt and fewer jobs. The second point is to put a freeze on tax rates for two years. Mr. Boehner argues that when taxes go up, it hurts families and small businesses. BP Investigation . AZUZ: When it comes to something like the Gulf Coast oil spill, a lot of people want to know whom can be blamed. Well, there's a new report out that puts most of that blame on TransOcean and Halliburton, two companies that BP hired to work on the oil well. But the report was written by BP. The company did accept some of the responsibility. It says faulty cementing, a misread pressure test, and a blowout preventer that wasn't maintained correctly all led to the spill. Halliburton and Transocean have criticized BP's report. One expert talked about how this whole situation is a unique one. DON VAN NIEUWENHUISE, PROFESSOR, PETROLEUM GEOSCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON: What's interesting in this case is that, you know, they actually went through eight steps and no one said, ""Hey, stop."" That, to me, is more of a rig problem than, say, a systemic problem across the oil industry. Detroit Fires . AZUZ: 85 fires in four hours. That's what firefighters in Detroit, Michigan had to deal with Tuesday night. There were so many fires that nearby towns sent emergency workers to help out. Fire officials say a lot of the blazes started when strong winds knocked down power lines. The winds then carried flames from house to house. That caused nine homes to catch fire on one block alone. Officials say no one was hurt, but a power company spokesperson said 15,000 people still didn't have power yesterday morning. Authorities think at least one fire might have been caused by arson; it might have been set on purpose. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam. True! During Ramadan, Muslims don't eat or drink during daylight hours. Ramadan Observance . AZUZ: There are more than a billion Muslims around the world. And for them, Ramadan is the most sacred time of the year. It's been going on since August; it'll finish at the end of this week. But the exact date when Ramadan finishes this year has some Muslims considering how they might celebrate the end of Ramadan. It's on September 11th, and this is the first time since the 9/11 attacks that Ramadan has ended on that date. Mary Snow visits an Islamic center in New York to see how celebrations might be balanced with sensitivity. (BEGIN VIDEO) MARY SNOW, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Afternoon prayers at the Islamic center of Long Island. As Ramadan draws to a close later this week, these worshipers are being advised to tone down what is usually a celebratory occasion. SAJID SHAH, PRESIDENT, ISLAMIC CENTER OF LONG ISLAND: After 30 days of fasting, you know, this is the month that ended our celebration. SNOW: How will it be different this year? SHAH: This year will be a little different. You know, we are not celebrating the way we suppose to do, normally would do. SNOW: Because? SHAH: Because of 9/11. SNOW: The end of Ramadan, or Eid, depending on the moon Thursday night, falls on either Friday or Saturday, which is September 11th. But many Muslims have decided to mark it on Friday. Imam Al-Amin Abdul Latif is the head of the Islamic Leadership Council in New York, an umbrella group of Muslim organizations. IMAM AL-AMIN ABDUL LATIF, MAJLIS ASH-SHURA: I guess people may think, look at Eid as a protest, you know, against, against people who may be celebrating. SNOW: One Muslim group, for example, celebrates Eid at Six Flags parks. This year, organizers have been careful not to schedule their events for September 11th. It comes against the backdrop over anger about the proposed Islamic center near Ground Zero and protests at other mosques around the country. Muslims are trying to send out their own message, like this public service announcement created through grassroots efforts. VIDEO CLIP, MYFAITHMYVOICE.COM: I don't want to take over this country. SNOW: One Muslim leader who works with an interfaith youth group in Chicago says he feels the attitude towards Muslims this year is unlike any other. EBOO PATEL, INTERFAITH YOUTH CORE: Frankly, I have not felt this fearful. A mother came up to me at my Muslim house of worship earlier this week and said to me, ""Eboo, when will my 8 and 10-year-old sons stop being bullied on the playground because of their names, Ahmed and Akbar?"" And what I said to her is ""very soon, very soon,"" because the forces of inclusion in America have always defeated the forces of intolerance, and they will defeat the forces of intolerance again. SNOW: This 9/11, this mosque in Westbury, New York will dedicate a peace garden with other clergy, but it has also asked local police for protection following suspicious incident of broken windows at the mosque. Imam Latif says his group has also decided not to hold a counter-protest Saturday supporting the Islamic center near Ground Zero after the families of 9/11 victims requested they not hold the rally. LATIF: We've been encouraging our people to be calm, to be patient, but be firm and be strong and to reach out, you know. SNOW: And this Islamic center, for one, is opening its doors to hold open houses with the aim of promoting understanding. (END VIDEO) Rosh Hashanah . AZUZ: Ramadan isn't the only religious holiday that's happening this week. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, began last night. It marks the start of the Jewish High Holy Days, which end ten days later with Yom Kippur. In Hebrew, Rosh Hashanah means ""beginning of the year."" It's also sometimes referred to as the ""day of repentance"" or ""day of remembrance."" One of the holiday's most significant rituals is the blowing of the shofar. It's a ram's horn that's used to call people to worship during the High Holy Days. Shoutout . BILL CAIACCIO, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What is the name for small, rocky objects that are found in space? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Nebula, B) Asteroid, C) Stalactite or D) Metroid? You've got three seconds -- GO! l Those rocky objects are called asteroids, and most of them are found between Mars and Jupiter. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Asteroid Encounter . AZUZ: The space community is buzzing about two asteroids that buzzed by Earth yesterday. One passed our planet in the morning. The other went by about 12 hours later. Both of them were closer to the Earth than the moon is. Officials say neither asteroid were any sort of threat to our planet. Unless you had a telescope, you wouldn't even have been able to see them. What's interesting about this is both asteroids passed so close to Earth on the same day, and that NASA spotted them so far in advance. The CNN Teachers' Lounge . AZUZ: We ask for your opinions on our blog, and you're great about giving them to us. Now, though, it's your teachers' turn! The CNN Teachers' Lounge is up and running. Teachers, this is where you can sound off on education issues. This week's question: When is the best time to start a new school year?

Even kneeboarding requires a bit of balance. This here dog has twice the legs we do, though, combined with a fish's love for the water. And when it comes to tricks, sit, shake and roll over have nothing on this. Chibi the water skiing dog is giving the water skiing squirrel a run for its acorns. How do you top this?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray, whose involuntary manslaughter trial starts next month, has hired a new lawyer for his legal team. Los Angeles lawyer Nareg Gourjian will assist lawyers Ed Chernoff and J. Michael Flanagan in defending Murray, who is charged in pop star Michael Jackson's death. A document filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday said Gourjian is replacing Joseph Low, who is leaving the Murray defense team. Gourjian is a former of associate of Mark Geragos, a lawyer known for high-profile criminal cases. He helped Geragos with those cases, including Chris Brown's domestic violence charge and the trial of Scott Peterson, who was convicted of killing his wife. Gourjian currently represents Joe Finley, an ""America's Got Talent"" prospect whose wife was found dead last fall at a Los Angeles hotel. Murray is accused of killing Michael Jackson in June of 2009 with an overdose of the anesthetic propofol. The defense lawyers and prosecution will meet for a hearing Tuesday to discuss discovery motions and other issues as they prepare for the start of jury selection on March 24. Judge Michael Pastor ruled last week that the trial can be televised.","Nareg Gourjian joins Ed Chernoff and J. Michael Flanagan to defend the doctor .

"(CNN) -- This list isn't just about soundtracks or great music in the movies -- it is about quintessential movie moments where a song flawlessly complements or enhances the action. Reservoir Dogs: Mr. Blonde tortures a prisoner accompanied by 70s bubblegum pop . A riff or harmony that works so perfectly that the hair on the back of your neck stands on end. Or a classic song at just the right moment to mainline feel good factor. We've compiled a list of 10 of what we think are the best. If you don't agree or think we've missed one, share your views by using the Sound Off box below and we'll publish the best. 1. The film: Easy Rider, Dennis Hopper (1969)  The song: Born to be Wild, Steppenwolf  The scene: The opening sequence   From the moment Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper kicked their motorbikes to life and gunned down the dusty highway accompanied by ""Born to be Wild"" almost 40 years ago, audiences were electrified. The lure of escaping onto endless, empty roads still resonates today, even if Steppenwolf has become the food of a million drivetime clichés. 2. The film: Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino (1992)  The song: Stuck in the middle with you, Stealers Wheel  The scene: Mr. Blonde cuts a man's ear off . ""You ever listen to K Billy's Super sounds of the 70's?"" asks Michael Madsen's super-cool psychopath Mr. Blonde as he opens up a cut throat razor. Innocuous -- but then we see a bloody man with a duct-taped mouth. Mr. Blonde tunes the radio, does an eccentric little dance to ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" and then brutally cuts the man's ear off. It's the juxtaposition of sadistic violence with bubblegum pop that epitomizes Tarantino's brilliance and has been much aped since. 3. The film: Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese (1990)  The song: Layla, Eric Clapton  The scene: Jimmy's murder spree montage . Scorsese's use of the piano exit from ""Layla"" over a montage showing the ugly demise of a series of gangsters after a heist is simply brilliant. The pink car, the garbage truck, the meat locker: scene after scene of horribly disfigured corpses that Scorsese has somehow imbued with the wistful poetry of the end of an era. 4. Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppola (1979)  The song: The End, The Doors  The scene: Captain Willard waiting for an assignment in Saigon   The Doors' dark epic twists and turns of over the opening scenes of Captain Willard waiting for his next assignment in a humid hotel room in Saigon. It perfectly evokes the stifling claustrophobia he feels stuck alone with nothing but his demons and a bottle for company. 5. The film: Muriel's Wedding, P. J. Hogan (1995)  The song: Waterloo by ABBA  The scene: Muriel and Rhonda triumph at a talent contest . ABBA-obsessed ugly duckling, Muriel performs ""Waterloo"" at the local talent contest and sticks the proverbial two fingers up to the small-town bitches who have been bullying her. Even the white satin jumpsuit straining over her ample figure can't take away from her triumph -- and when the synchronized dancing starts there aren't many film moments that can beat it for feel-good factor. 6. The film: Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe (2000)  The song: Tiny Dancer, Elton John  The scene: On the tourbus the band sing along to Tiny Dancer   1960's rockers, Stillwater, are stuck on the tour bus. No-one is talking and the tension is palpable. ""Tiny Dancer"" comes on the radio and slowly one by one they start singing along. Everyone grins and tensions drain away. Touching without being cheesy, this scene is full of nostalgia for good times had with friends and will stay with you long after watching the film. 7. Say Anything, Cameron Crowe (1989)  The song: In Your Eyes, Peter Gabriel  The scene: Lloyd tries to woo Diane . You have to admire Lloyd's (played by a young John Cusack) style as he stands outside love interest Diane's window holding his boombox aloft blaring ""In Your Eyes"" like a modern day Romeo. Maybe Peter Gabriel's song hasn't quite stood the test of time but if you don't get hung up on the fact that it sounds a bit cringeworthy now, this is a scene of perfect romance -- 80's-style. 8. The Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson (2001)  The song: Needle in the Hay, Elliot Smith  The scene: Richie Tenenbaum attempts suicide . Beautifully shot with no ambient noise, just the melancholy ""Needle in the Hay,"" we see Richie -- the tennis prodigy who never realized his potential --methodically cutting off all his hair before, shockingly, slicing his wrists. It's both intimate and appalling. In a dark coincidence, Smith died in 2003 as a result of two stab wounds to the chest, thought to be suicide. 9. Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, Stanley Kubrick (1964)  The song: We'll meet again, Vera Lynn  The scene: Nuclear apocalypse . ""We'll meet again, Don't know where, Don't know when,"" warbles a hopeful Vera Lynn as mushroom cloud after mushroom cloud explodes into the sky. It's as preposterous as making a comedy about nuclear armageddon. But with Kubrick at the helm and Peter Sellers playing three of the main characters, this unlikely film -- like its ending -- works very well indeed. The film: Trainspotting, Danny Boyle (1996)  The song: Lust for Life, Iggy Pop  The scene: Choose Life voiceover . The opening drumbeat of ""Lust for Life"" kicks in and Renton deadpans ""Chose life. Choose a career."" -- the beginning of one of the most cynically brilliant monologues in film or literature. It is strangely exhilarating and the fact that Iggy Pop is a punk legend and heroin survivor just adds to the pop culture cool.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of security officers cracked down on landmark sites in Iran's capital and other major cities Sunday, at times striking at throngs of protesters with batons and rushing others on motorcycles, witnesses said. A few plainclothes security agents stood in the middle of Tehran's Revolution Square, countering anti-government protesters with signs of their own in support of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and chanting ""I will give my life for the leader,"" an eyewitness told CNN. Hundreds of other security personnel cheered the group. Another witness said large crowds chanted ""Death to the dictator"" at the intersection of Gharib and Enghelab (revolution) avenues. Security forces on foot and motorcycles there beat several protesters with batons and detained at least four, the witness said. By nightfall, a witness in Tehran said the streets were quiet, with the exception of the occasional buzz of security forces' motorcycles. Earlier, witnesses reported that security officers doubled up on motorcycles charged a group of 150 people gathered on Vali Asr Avenue, striking at least 15 fleeing protesters with batons as crowds of people grew near Revolution Square. The daughter of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, one of the nation's most powerful clerics and a vocal critic of the government, was briefly detained on Vali Asr for ""provocative behavior,"" Iranian media reported. Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani was chanting anti-government slogans to create ""unrest in the streets,"" the official Islamic Republic News Agency said. The semi-official Fars news agency she was released shortly after her arrest. Opposition websites reported that security forces opened fire on protesters in Hafteh Tir Square, killing one person. Safari-Ali Baratloo, a security official, denied there were clashes in Tehran on Sunday, much less a death, the semi-official Fars news agency said. He accused the websites of reporting lies. Iranian security forces put up a steel gate in front of the narrow alley that leads to opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi's Tehran home, opposition website Kaleme reported.  An employee at a neighborhood hospital confirmed to CNN by phone that a new steel gate now blocks entry to the alley. She said the gate was not there on Friday. Moussavi and fellow opposition leader Mehdi Karrubi -- both of whom have decried the results of the June 2009 election that declared President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner -- have been under house arrest in recent weeks. Security forces surrounded Moussavi's Tehran home on Saturday, blocking anyone from coming or going, and cut off all phone lines, according to opposition websites. Moussavi's family members say the security forces have told them they're from the prosecutor's office, but have not provided any identification or produced court order for the heightened restrictions, Kaleme reported. Large numbers of security forces continued to patrol areas throughout Tehran and other parts of the Islamic Republic. Hundreds of miles south of the capital, protesters in Isfahan were met with batons and pepper spray in one square while hundreds of others were able to march peacefully under the watch of about 200 security agents at another demonstration site, a witness said. Two protesters in Isfahan were beaten, then taken away in an unmarked car by security agents, the witness said. An eyewitness in historic Shiraz, who participated in demonstrations Sunday, told CNN that large crowds of anti-government protesters have gathered along Mollasadra Avenue in the center of the city. Roughly 200 people, including men and women of all ages, gathered at the site, but were dispersed by uniformed and plainclothes security agents who hit at protesters with batons. The witness, an art student who has been involved in protests in Iran since the 2009 fallout over Iran's disputed presidential election, said security officers on motorcycles would aim for the crowd but swerve just before of hitting people. She said she saw at least five people wounded at the scene. CNN could not independently verify the reports. Reporting from Iran has been difficult this week -- foreign journalists were denied visas, accredited journalists living in the country were restricted from covering the demonstrations and internet speed slowed to a crawl in an apparent attempt to both limit protest organizing and restrict information from being transmitted out of the country. Earlier, sources told CNN that 11 journalists, cameramen and photographers working for international media had their work permits revoked by Iran's ministry of culture on Friday for covering unrest in the country on February 14. They include staffers from AFP, Al-Jazeera and The New York Times. New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha confirmed to CNN that a Times reporter's press credentials were confiscated in Iran. Ha said the newspaper is not identifying the reporter and would not share any more details. Last week, thousands of government opponents marched in Tehran on Monday. And Wednesday, thousands more took to the streets for the funeral of a man killed in Monday's demonstration. Iranian authorities began rounding up many government opponents last week amid calls for protests like those that have swept across North Africa and the Middle East.

"(CNN) -- The opening race of the Formula One season, the Bahrain Grand Prix, has been axed due to ongoing political unrest in the country. The Bahrain government confirmed the race, scheduled for March 13, had been called off on Monday afternoon after days of speculation. The Bahraini Crown Prince, Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa, informed Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone of the decision by telephone after days of unrest in the Gulf kingdom. The 2011 Formula One season will now begin in Melbourne, Australia on March 27. CNN blog: Have F1's global riches come at a cost? The Crown Prince told the country's Information Affairs Authority Twitter site: ""We felt it was important for the country to focus on immediate issues of national interest. ""Bahrain's priority is on overcoming tragedy, healing divisions and rediscovering the fabric that draws this country together to remind the world of the very best that Bahrain is capable of as a nation once again united. ""At the present time the country's entire attention is focused on building a new national dialogue for Bahrain. ""I would like to extend my personal gratitude to Bernie Ecclestone for his support and understanding."" Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent days to protest against the country's ruling monarchy, basing themselves at the Pearl Roundabout in the capital Manama. Around 10 protestors were reported to have been killed after security services attempted to clear the roundabout on Thursday. The Crown Prince said he was deeply sorry for the deaths in an interview with CNN. There has been no announcement yet on whether the race will be held at a later date, though chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit Zayed R. Alzayani told CNN he was hopeful there would be an annoucement in a ""matter of weeks."" He said: ""That all depends on how the events in Bahrain going on at present turn out -- there will be a process of reconciliation launched soon and all parties will come to the table in response to his Royal Highness's efforts and things will come back to normality."" The cancellation of the race could be costly for Bahrain's economy. The 2008 grand prix was worth around $600 million in direct and indirect revenue, according to the Marcopolis website. British newspaper The Times reported that it cost Bahrain race organizers $40 million to secure a place in this year's calendar, plus another $20 million to ensure it was the first of the season. On top of that, the $200 million Sakhir circuit has also had a $50 million revamp since last year's race. Mark Webber, driver for the Red Bull team, backed the cancellation. He said ""I think the right decision was made, in light of what is going on, so we look forward to Melbourne instead. ""It would have been nice to go to Bahrain, but hopefully it can stage the race again. As for starting in Melbourne, it's my home race and, as always, I'm looking forward to it. Webber's comments were echoed by Renault team boss Eric Boullier. He said: ""The recent situation in Bahrain has been difficult for the country. We feel the decision taken by the Crown Prince is wise and we fully support it. ""The Bahrain Grand Prix has always been warmly welcomed with enthusiasm from the Bahraini people and we're looking forward to going back there when they have healed their country.""","The Bahrain Grand Prix has been canceled .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso has been banned for four matches by UEFA after he ""assaulted"" Tottenham's assistant manager during their Champions League tie. The Italian grabbed 59-year-old Joe Jordan round the throat during the match as tempers flared, then as the pair came face-to-face after the final whistle, Gattuso launched a head-butt. UEFA charged the 33-year-old with ""gross sporting misconduct"" after Milan's 1-0 defeat in the first leg of their last 16 tie with the English Premier League club at the San Siro stadium. He was due to miss the second leg next week anyway after picking up his third yellow card of the competition during the clash. CNN blog: Why Gattuso has to lose his cool . A statement on UEFA's website read: ""AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso has been suspended for four competition matches by the UEFA control and disciplinary body.

"(CNN) -- Scientists in New Zealand said there had been less than a one in twenty chance of Tuesday's earthquake being so destructive. The fatal 6.3 magnitude quake that has damaged much of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island was actually an aftershock of the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that struck the same area in September last year. Seismologists for GNS Science had calculated on Monday that there was only a 35% chance of a 5.0 magnitude aftershock hitting the region in the near future, but only a 4% chance of a 6.0 or above aftershock. Check out CNN's hi-res image gallery of the earthquake . ""It's part of a sequence, so not uncommon, but this was so large it will have aftershocks of its own,"" said Dr. Bill Fry of GNS Science. Tuesday's quake caused widespread damage as the epicenter was only around 3 miles (5 kilometers) below the earth's surface. ""Anything less than 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) deep is really shallow,"" said Fry. Fry and his colleagues had been monitoring the region since the September 4 earthquake. That quake struck before dawn and authorities said the deserted streets at that time likely kept injuries to a minimum. Most earthquakes happen away from the Christchurch region, said Fry, but in a country that experiences around 15,000 earthquakes each year, it wasn't completely unexpected, he said. The majority of those quakes are hardly felt and do not damage property. On average New Zealand only experiences a few magnitude 6 earthquakes each year. Prior to Tuesday's quake the most damaging to hit the country was in 1931 near Hawke's Bay on the North Island. The country is on the south western edge of the Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and earthquakes that ring the Pacific ocean, and straddles the Pacific and Indian-Australian tectonic plates. Movement of the plates causes earthquakes across the country and volcanic activity in the North Island. Christchurch is New Zealand's second biggest city on the eastern side of the South Island. The population of around 390,000 and enjoys a mild climate and close proximity to beaches and mountains. Aftershocks are expected to continue to hit the Christchurch region in the coming days and weeks. The usual pattern is for a large aftershock followed by others of diminishing magnitude, said Fry. ""The country is very seismically active. We probably won't see another (aftershock) this big, but there is still a statistical chance,"" Fry cautioned. Dean Irvine contributed to this report .","New Zealand is a globally a very seismically active area; 15,000 quakes each year .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Mickey Rourke says there is only one person he blames for the spectacular implosion of his career the first time round -- himself. Mickey Rourke backstage at the Golden Globes holding his Best Actor award for his portrayal of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson in ""The Wrestler."" ""You lose your house, your wife, your career, your everything at one time,"" he says, ""You've got to look in the mirror and go 'It's your fault.'"" For a long time it looked like Rourke was destined for obscurity. But, amazingly, he has battled his way back to the top. It has taken him 15 years, but his critically-acclaimed role in Darren Aronofsky's latest film, ""The Wrestler"" might finally allow the actor to shake off the notoriety and grab on to the career that should have been his all along. Rourke's recent Golden Globe win for Best Actor seems to be just another chapter in the actor's strange roller coaster story. Despite early promise, Rourke gained such a terrible reputation for self-destructive behavior and on-set antics that, no one in Hollywood would touch him. He has also been beset by public mistakes and scandal: his ruined face, the arrests and alleged spousal abuse, a short stint as a boxer and some terrible career choices -- he turned down the role of prize-fighter Butch Coolidge in ""Pulp Fiction"" which was eventually played by Bruce Willis. Today, a relaxed, expansive Rourke is sitting in sweats in a private room at an exclusive London hotel that is thick with cigarette smoke. The Face, battered during his short boxing career and reconstructed with extensive plastic surgery, is, unexpectedly, less of a train wreck in the flesh, although his moustache does look distinctly stuck-on. His ever-present pet Chihuahua, Loki, is also there, slumbering quietly by Rourke's side in a tiny gray hooded top. (In his Golden Globes acceptance speech, he thanked his dogs saying, ""Sometimes when a man is alone, that's all you've got is your dog."") Squashed on top of his scarecrow hair extensions is a beanie with the word ""indestructible"" embroidered across the front. It's not a bad description for the 52-year-old actor. Candid is another one -- especially about the bad times. ""Seeing your entourage leaving with everything they can carry."" he says, giving an example of a particularly bleak time, ""And you're standing there in the dark with your thumb up your ass."" It is the uncomfortable parallels between the ups and downs of Rourke's life and that of his character Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson -- a burnt-out fighter, once a crowd-puller, now scraping a living from second division fights in school gyms -- that give particular resonance to the role. ""There was so much of the character ... living in shame, the character being a has-been, it was like it hit me in the face really hard,"" he tells CNN. He says he also knew director Aronofsky would ""want his pound of flesh."" ""I knew he'd want me to revisit some very dark painful places."" Things started to go wrong for Rourke in 1987, at the height of his fame after explicit blockbuster ""9 1/2 Weeks."" He says simply that he lost interest in acting and preferred riding motorcycles. But it was more than that. Alan Parker, who directed Rourke in 1987 film ""Angel Heart"" is quoted as calling him ""a nightmare"" and ""very dangerous on set."" Rourke puts this down to a problem with authority -- for him ""there were no rules"" -- and an innate mistrust of the political side of Hollywood. He says it could be to do with being abused by his father as a child. ""You look at some other guy who's making movies and they're calling him a movie star or whatever and the guy can't, he can't carry your jockstrap. ""Because of my temperament and my upbringing I took it real personal and short-circuited."" Whatever it was, Rourke gave up acting and took up professional boxing for four years in the early 1990s and, it seems he was able to fully indulge his self-destructive streak. By the time doctors told him he must stop boxing, he was suffering from memory loss, poor balance and needed extensive plastic surgery to reconstruct his battered face. Of course, Rourke's scandals and problems wouldn't be half as interesting if it wasn't for his prodigious talent. He was one of the last actors to train with the legendary Lee Strasberg at the Actor's studio in New York with Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Chris Walken and Harvey Keitel. Early roles had some comparing him to Marlon Brando and De Niro. He says he has spent the last 13 years going to therapy to deal with his issues -- not a natural place for an ""old school guy."" ""For me it would be easier to talk to a priest than a therapist,"" he explains, ""I was afraid that if I changed I wouldn't be a man."" But, he says he persevered and straightened out ""some issues from my childhood."" He says he is now a changed man and is being welcomed back into the bosom of Hollywood: he is reprising his role as ""Marv"" in ""Sin City 2,"" is lined up for a role in Sylvester Stallone's ""The Expendables"" and is in talks to play a villain in the upcoming blockbuster ""Iron Man 2"" -- his first major studio film since resurrecting his career. He's still a bit edgy, though. Even after all the years of therapy. He recently sparked up one of his beloved Marlboros during an interview and, then, of course, he called Sean Penn a ""homophobe,"" as reported in the Los Angeles Times. Does he ever worry he might throw it all away again? ""I'll never lose it all again,"" he says, ""It was too much hard work to get it back and too lonely and too dark. ""I've worked too hard for it. It would be too hard to take.""","Mickey Rourke has spent 15 years battling his way back to the top .

"(CNN) -- Libya's Moammar Gadhafi is clinging to power despite a wave of opposition due in part to a legacy of decentralized authority and divided tribal politics that has been reinforced during the embattled strongman's four-decade rule, analysts told CNN Tuesday. Gadhafi's grip on power nevertheless appears to be weakening, a fact illustrated by the recent defections of a number of prominent Libyan diplomatic officials.  Libya's ambassador to the United States and deputy ambassador to the United Nations are among those now pushing for Gadhafi to step aside. In eastern Libya, groups of armed people in civilian clothing have been guarding the streets and appear to be in firm control.  Two Libyan fighter pilots defected to Malta with their jets on Monday rather than follow orders to bomb their fellow citizens. But Gadhafi has been able to carry through on a brutal crackdown resulting in the apparent deaths of hundreds of Libyans.  He pledged Tuesday to die ""a martyr"" before voluntarily relinquishing power. Opposition to Gadhafi is hampered by the fact that Libya's sense of national identity is ""very weak,"" said Robert Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.  Tribal loyalty in the sparsely populated North African country comes first -- a fact which makes it extremely tough for Gadhafi's opponents to present a unified front. For years, Gadhafi has effectively played different tribes against each another while using Libyan oil wealth to generate patronage and buy off potential opponents, Danin said.  A resulting decentralized power structure beneath the very top levels of the Libyan government has made it easier for the longtime leader to survive in the face of a growing push for change. To the extent that Gadhafi has empowered others in his regime, he has placed his trust in a few key members of his own ethnic group, according to Jennifer Cooke, head of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  Using tools of co-option and coercion, he effectively shifted power away from the city of Benghazi and the eastern portion of the country -- traditional bases of opposition to his rule. Recently, Gadhafi further bolstered his power by bringing in mercenaries from neighboring countries such as Sudan and Chad.  Libya's armed forces remain relatively weak by design, Danin noted.  Gadhafi has worked over the years to prevent the creation of a military that could become unified in opposition to him, a development that contributed to the overthrow of the Egyptian and Tunisian governments. ""This has been an absolute rule,"" Danin told CNN.  ""There have been no countervailing institutions.""  Egypt, in contrast to Libya, had at least ""some organized political opposition, some freedom of the press, and some freedom of association,"" traditions which proved critical in the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak. Gadhafi, much like his counterparts in Iran, has also not hesitated to use brutal force when necessary.  He has shown ""no reservations about bombing people into submission,"" Cooke noted. Adding to the hurdles faced by would-be reformers: Tripoli's lack of a strong tradition of vibrant intellectual discourse and dissent.  ""He's been very successful in tamping down any potential opposition from an intellectual class,"" Cooke said. And while Libya has a wealthy business community, ""there's fear to speak out on the issues,"" she added. Can Gadhafi survive the winds of change? If he falls, Cooke asserted, it will likely be due to opposition from the military's middle ranks -- an officer corps that has been subjected to repeated purges in the past. While the purges have helped Gadhafi maintain his hold on power over the years, they haven't made him very popular, she noted. To the extent that the outside world can influence events in Libya, there will be a continued push for rapid change, Danin argued.  Western European countries such as France, Germany and Italy are extremely dependent on Libyan oil and cannot tolerate instability there. ""If Libya descends into civil war with major disruptions in the oil market, this could really hit Europe in its pocketbook,"" he said. ""We're in uncharted waters now,"" Danin noted.  ""It seems that the regime is rotting from within. ... It's hard to see how he puts the genie back in the bottle.  If he does, it'll require such enormous brutality that Libya will become a true international pariah."" CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Moammar Gadhafi has clung to power partly by creating obstacles to a unified opposition .

"(CNN) -- Cricket officials plan to commemorate the victims of the New Zealand earthquake when the country's national team plays neighboring Australia at the World Cup in India on Friday. Emergency workers are searching for survivors after at least 65 people were killed in a 6.3-magnitude quake in the southern hemisphere nation's second-biggest city Christchurch on Tuesday. ""At times like this, sport can only offer its support and its deepest sympathy to those who have lost loved ones during such a tragedy,"" International Cricket Council chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. ""It's a helpless feeling but I will be discussing with the organizers of the Cricket World Cup how we can most appropriately remember those who lost their lives or have been injured and affected when the Black Caps play their next match against Australia in Nagpur on Friday."" New Zealand Cricket's headquarters is based in Christchurch, which is reeling from its second serious earthquake in six months. The first in September was stronger but caused no fatalities. It is the South Island's third tragedy in that period, following the mine explosion that killed 29 people in November. ""The news we have is that the NZC offices have been severely damaged but thankfully everyone who works for NZC seems to have escaped without injury,"" Lorgat said. The New Zealand players opened their World Cup campaign on Sunday with a comfortable win over Kenya, but are now preparing for a much more difficult task against four-time champions Australia. ""The greatest thing I think we can do for everyone is win our game against Australia. That'll bring a little bit of light relief to a lot of people going through a tough time,"" captain Daniel Vettori told the NZC website on Tuesday. ""It's been a tough morning. Five or six guys from the team and the management are based in Christchurch. It's been a rough time for them finding out that their families are safe. ""For everyone within the team, they have family or friends in Christchurch so they're feeling it too. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the Canterbury community."" Some of the Kiwi players wrote about the situation on social networking website Twitter. ""Everyone's families are fine. But quite a numb and flat feeling in the squad. Training was tough yet surprisingly the quality very high,"" said Scott Styris. Netherlands captain Peter Borren, who was in action against England in Nagpur on Tuesday, was born in Christchurch and actually played for New Zealand at youth level before switching international allegiances in 2006. ""I managed to get hold of my immediate family, who were all okay, so that was a relief,"" he said at a press conference after the match. ""Obviously it's a tragedy and it's been a tough day back in Christchurch. Hopefully everyone can look after themselves and move on."" Borren scored 35 not out as team lost by six wickets after setting England a victory target of 293 in 50 overs, with Ryan ten Doeschate top-scoring on 119 for the Dutch. England passed that with more than an over to spare, as captain Andrew Strauss led the way with 88 and Jonathan Trott scored 62. The venue for the tournament's April 2 final, Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, has been cleared by fire safety officials following earlier concerns, the Press Trust of India reported Tuesday. Christchurch, meanwhile, is scheduled to host seven matches at the 2011 Rugby World Cup in September and October, including two quarterfinals. The International Rugby Union said it was too early to evaluate whether the city would be able to fulfill its commitments. ""The thoughts and deepest sympathies of the global rugby family are with the people of Christchurch, their families and all New Zealanders at this very difficult time,"" it said in a statement. ""We feel it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage on the status of Rugby World Cup 2011 infrastructure or operations. The focus at this point must be on the emergency response.""","ICC plans memorial for Christchurch earthquake victims at Cricket World Cup match .

"(CNN) -- NASCAR has a new king. It's not enough that the Daytona 500 champion turned 20 years old the day before the race, making him the youngest driver ever to win; he is also the first rookie ever to win it. ""I never thought in a million years we were gonna win our first one,"" Trevor Bayne told CNN Monday morning, ""it's incredible."" Bayne wasn't the only one who didn't think he would win. He came into the race a complete underdog, according to some NASCAR writers, and even into the last lap, it was anyone's guess who would take the checkered flag. Read about Trevor Bayne's race for faith . Bayne said that after he saw the white flag signaling the final lap, ""I thought we were in the worst position possible."" Less than a minute later, he got an unobstructed view of the checkered flag, and ""there was a collective gasp at the track,"" said motorsports writer Jeff Gluck. ""It was probably the most memorable race I've ever been to,"" said Gluck, who is starting his eighth season covering NASCAR. Bayne, less than a full day into his historic win in NASCAR's most prestigious race, has been thrust into sudden fame. ""It hasn't sunk in to me yet just how big a deal this is,"" said the Knoxville, Tennessee, native. ""This is just, ah, incredible."" Sunday's race provided a record-setting start for NASCAR's premier Sprint Cup series, and a fresh new face for fans. ""It's great for the sport,"" Gluck says, ""fans have been clamoring for a new personality."" ""Nobody doesn't like him,"" Gluck said of Bayne. ""He's someone everyone can get behind.""

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Hundreds of people fled a pro-Alassane Ouattara neighborhood in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to incumbent President Laurent Gbabgbo have been fighting an armed Ouattara supporters for the past week. Ggagbo's Army spokesman also said their forces fought armed supporters of Ouattara Thursday night in Yamoussoukro where two insurgents were killed and several wounded. Violence sharply escalated over the last week in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Abidjan and spread to the political capital Yamoussoukro as well as the west of the country, putting more refugees and displaced people on the roads. The government imposed a curfew from Friday to Monday morning. The violence rose sharply mid-week after a mission of four African heads of state, mandated by the African Union to find a ""binding solution"" to the Ivorian post electoral crisis, left Abidjan. Emanuel Djaman, a teacher in Abidjan, said he saw several bodies lying on the ground when he was leaving his school after it was shut down because of the fighting. Other witnesses fleeing the area reported heavy fighting and casualties. The conflict was set off in November after a run-off presidential election between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and challenger Alassane Ouattara -- an election in which both men claimed victory. An independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner of the election, but Gbagbo has refused to step aside. Ouattara is holed up in the Golf hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. Earlier Friday, during a rally in Abidjan, Gbagbo's minister of youth, Ble Goude, called on young supporters of the incumbent ""to organize committees to impede by any means the movements of U.N. forces around the country."" He also told the youth to get ready to liberate ""the Golf Hotel in one week from now."" In a statement released Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed deep concern over the deteriorating situation in Ivory Coast, deploring recent clashes between rival groups as well as threats against the United Nations, including the call to impede the movement of peacekeepers. ""These developments mark a disturbing escalation which draws the country closer to the brink of reigniting civil war,"" Ban warned. In his Friday statement, Ban reiterated his call on both sides to exercise maximum restraint and to extend their cooperation to the African Union High-Level Panel. He said he hopes that the panel will expedite its discussions and take decisions that will help prevent further violence and facilitate a peaceful settlement to the crisis. Meanwhile, Gbagbo's government accused U.N. troops of killing a police officer in Daloa. Army spokesman Col. Babri Gohourou said on national television that the police officer went to the U.N. camp to negotiate the release of three Gbagbo supporters who were arrested during a demonstration. Gohourou said the U.N. peacekeepers shot the officer in the back while he was bringing the three young men away from the camp. Earlier this week, government spokesman Ahoua don Mello alleged that the pro-Ouattara forces were engaged in ""a revolution with the help of UN forces."" U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure denied the allegations in a telephone interview. The political standoff in the country has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002. More than 33,000 people have fled to neighboring Liberia since the crisis began; 20,000 more have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations.","Violence spreads to Ivory Coasts political capital .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh is calling for an end to the protests in that country and said he supports the creation of a national unity government to oversee upcoming parliamentary elections, the state-run news service Saba reported Wednesday. According to the news service, Saleh made the statement during a meeting with an official with the non-profit National Democratic Institute. Saba reported that Saleh told the official, Leslie Campbell, the NDI's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, that demonstrations must stop to ""prepare for a suitable atmosphere"" for the elections. Saleh also ordered security forces to prevent clashes between demonstrators both for and against . the government, and urged both sides to prevent ""saboteurs"" from entering their ranks, Saba reported. Saleh also repeated his pledge not to run for re-election, Saba reported. Anti-government demonstrators say that's not good enough. Undeterred by an attack on their sit-in a day earlier, anti-government protesters gathered at Sanaa University again on Wednesday to demand that  Saleh step down. ""We are worried that it could happen again. But we have nothing to lose and it's for the sake of the country,"" said Yasser Hasani, a student. At least two people were killed when government loyalists attacked and opened fire on sit-in participants Tuesday night, an opposition lawmaker said. Foad Dahaba, a lawmaker with the opposition Islah party, provided the figure to CNN on Wednesday. Until now, protesters had provided conflicting numbers for the toll. Some of the protesters carried photos of the two victims, calling them martyrs. ""We feel sad for what happened yesterday but we are enthusiastic that their blood will not be forgotten,"" Hasani said Wednesday. ""Everyday that passes with bloodshed makes us stronger and more firm in our demands. Earlier Tuesday, sit-in participants had overturned a car and set it on fire after discovering weapons inside apparently brought to a demonstration by government loyalists, a protester said. Demonstrators noticed a parked car near the sit-in and were told that the people in the car were government loyalists who had come to harass them, according to one of the protesters, Adnan al-Nathari. Several hundred students converged on the car to confront those inside, who then fled, he said.  The protesters searched the car and found a rifle and a gun, al-Nathari told CNN.  The students then flipped the car and set it ablaze. There were no injuries reported in that incident. The sit-in at Sanaa University was one of at least five protests on Tuesday in Yemen.  There were others in Aden and Taiz, and in the provinces of Ibb and Lahj. Saleh's call for the creation of a new government to supervise parliamentary elections came two days after he rejected demands that he give up power. On Monday,  Saleh rejected demands that he step aside and compared the anti-government protests to an illness sweeping through the region. ""This is a virus and is not part of our heritage or the culture of the Yemeni people,"" he told reporters. ""It's a virus that came from Tunisia to Egypt. And to some regions, the scent of the fever is like influenza. As soon as you sit with someone who is infected, you'll be infected."" Saleh added that those seeking change should accept the reforms he has proposed. He had earlier said he won't seek another term in 2013 after being in power for 32 years. He also said he would postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for April to allow more time for discussions about reform.","NEW: Yemen's president calls for a new government to oversee parliamentary elections .

"Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Protesters, Tea Partiers and now rock 'n rollers. Wisconsin's growing demonstration over a budget bill that supporters call vital and opponents label union-busting continues Monday with guitarist Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame planning to play for the protesters a day after Republican Gov. Scott Walker signaled no retreat on the measure. The growing crowds gathering daily in Madison, the state capital, over the issue exceeded 50,000 on Saturday, according to an official estimate, and shows no sign of abating. ""History is happening in the streets of Madison, Wisconsin and I'm going to be there,"" said a statement by Morello, who will perform in his solo identity as The Nightwatchman. Calling the proposed budget law ""unjust,"" Morello said he will join ""teachers, students, firefighters, policemen, Green Bay Packers, nurses, steel workers, construction workers and religious groups that are filling the streets to protest."" He referred to Walker as ""the Mubarak of the Midwest"" in reference to the Egyptian leader ousted by popular protest, and accused the governor and unnamed corporate allies of trying to ""rob American workers of their fundamental rights."" The Budget Repair Bill proposed by Walker to address a $137 million shortfall through June 30 would increase contributions of state workers for their pensions and health insurance benefits. It also requires collective bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification, a costly procedure, and eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks. Last week, 14 Democratic state senators essentially boycotted the legislature and went to Illinois to prevent a quorum from passing the bill. The measure's opponents say they won't allow a vote unless Walker negotiates on the plan to eliminate collective bargaining rights for everything but wages. Walker rejected such a deal Sunday in an interview on ""FOX News Sunday."" He called the Democratic complaint of union-busting ""a red herring"" and said significant changes were needed for budgetary reasons, but powerful public employee unions were able to block the necessary adjustments. ""If we're going to ask our state and local workers who are doing a great job to pay a little bit more, to sacrifice, to help to balance this budget, we should also give them the flexibility saying that for those members, for those workers, who don't want to be a part of the union, if you don't want that deduction each month out of the paycheck, they should be able to get that $500, $600 or in some cases, $1,000 back that they can apply for their health care and their pension contribution,"" Walker said. Democratic U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin of neighboring Illinois disagreed, saying that anyone who thinks the bill is only about money and the budget would also think that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was working only for African Americans to have access to restaurants. ""There's a much bigger issue at stake here,"" Durbin said on the NBC program ""Meet the Press,"" adding that Walker ""is not setting out just to fix a budget; he's setting out to break a union."" However, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said the events in his state are a microcosm of the budget pressure felt by governors throughout the country . ""It just shows the point, all levels of government have been making empty promises to people,"" Ryan said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""And these governors are telling people the truth."" Walker said he hoped the Democratic state senators would return to Madison so that debate on the bill could ensue, but added that all options were on the table -- including a possible contempt proceeding -- if they don't. On Saturday, Tea Party activists supporting the bill brought a new dimension to the street demonstration. ""Wisconsin is ground zero,"" said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. ""I think it is going to determine largely whether the pampered nature of these public employees is finally reigned in."" One of the missing Democratic state senators, Jon Erpenbach, said all state and local public employees -- including teachers -- have agreed to the financial aspects of Walker's requested concessions on paying more for employee health care and pensions. ""In return they ask only that the provisions that deny their right to collectively bargain are removed,"" Erpenbach said. ""This will solve the budget challenge."" Walker, however, said it was necessary to change the collective bargaining rules because the alternative would be laying off thousands of state employees. ""I can't have anybody laid off,"" he said on FOX. ""I don't want a single person laid off in the public nor in the private sector, and that's why this is a much better alternative than to losing jobs."" Until Saturday's counter-demonstrators appeared, the growing protests since Monday were largely made up of those against Walker's plan. They remained the clear majority of those marching, with of them on Saturday drawn by the arrival of Walker's supporters. There were no reports of major incidents or arrests by late Saturday afternoon, and authorities expressed their gratitude. ""On behalf of all the law enforcement agencies that helped keep the peace on the Capitol Square Saturday, a very sincere thank you to all of those who showed up to exercise their First Amendment rights,"" Madison police said in a statement. ""You conducted yourselves with great decorum and civility, and if the eyes of the nation were upon Wisconsin, then you have shown how democracy can flourish even amongst those who passionately disagree."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney addressed the continued protests Friday, saying President Barack Obama ""is very understanding of the need for state governments, governors, state legislatures to reduce spending to make tough choices to be fiscally responsible."" But he added, ""He also feels very strongly that we need not to make this an assault on the collective bargaining rights of workers in any given state. ""He understands public employees need to make sacrifices just like everyone else."" Walker and other Republicans criticized Obama on Sunday for getting involved in the issue, calling it inappropriate. CNN's Gabriella Schwarz, Tom Cohen, Casey Wian and Chris Welch contributed to this report.","Rock guitarist says he'll play for protesters on Monday .

"(CNN) -- A.B. de Villiers scored the fastest century by a South African batsman at a Cricket World Cup to give his country a winning start to the 2011 tournament on Thursday, beating the West Indies by seven wickets in New Delhi. De Villiers, who also scored a World Cup ton against the Windies four years ago with 146 in the Caribbean, guided the Proteas to their target of 223 with 7.1 of the 50 allotted overs remaining. He came to the crease with South Africa wobbling at 20-2 after key batsman Jacques Kallis fell for just four runs, but he added 119 with captain Graeme Smith (45) to steady the innings and then an unbroken 84 with J.P. Duminy. There was a brief break for rain after 38 overs, but De Villiers went on to reach three figures in 97 balls faced -- a lot slower than Australian Matthew Hayden's record of 66 against South Africa in 2007. World Cup cricketers to honor NZ earthquake victims . It was the 27-year-old's 10th century in one-day internationals -- nine of them have resulted in victories -- and his third against the West Indies as he finished on 107 off 105 balls. He told reporters that his time with Indian Premier League side Delhi Darevils in the lucrative Twenty20 competition had proved insightful. ""I chatted to Graeme before the game and said that the outfield gets very damp at night here, therefore it's better to bat second. It's really hard to defend a total on this outfield,"" de Villiers said in quotes carried by the AFP agency. Duminy passed 2,000 runs in limited-overs cricket as he hit the winning shot to be unbeaten on 42 from 53 balls in his World Cup debut against the 1975 and 1979 champions. The match had an inauspicious start when the South African national anthem was cut short, to the bemusement of the players and fans. Another South African debutant, spin bowler Imran Tahir, claimed four wickets in his first international match as the Windies were bowled out for 222 in 47.3 overs after losing the toss and being asked to bat first. The Pakistan-born 31-year-old ended with figures of 4-41 from his 10 overs, while fast bowler Dale Steyn took 3-24 and spinner Johan Botha claimed 2-48 in his first World Cup outing. Australia captain Ponting reprimanded for TV incident . The West Indies reached 113 for the loss of only one batsman when Botha, who opened the bowling with Steyn, trapped top scorer Darren Bravo leg before wicket for 73 off 82 deliveries. Tahir then struck twice before Dwayne Bravo was run-out after a rollicking 40 off 37 balls that featured three sixes. Tahir also dismissed veteran left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul for 31 and Steyn cleaned up the tail as the last five wickets fell for just 14 runs. The result put South Africa second in Group B on run differential behind co-hosts India and above England, with all three teams having won their opening matches. On Friday the action returns to Group A, with four-time champions Australia playing New Zealand in the Indian city of Nagpur. In Group B, co-hosts Bangladesh take on Ireland in Dhaka.","South Africa beat West Indies by seven wickets in Group B clash in New Delhi .

"(CNN) -- Lyon scored a late equalizer against Real Madrid to deny Karim Benzema a victorious return to his old club on Tuesday, while Chelsea moved towards a place in the Champions League quarterfinals with victory at Copenhagen. Claude Puel's Lyon team are now unbeaten in seven encounters with Real in Europe's top club competition. Nine-time European champions Real had lost in three previous visits to the Stade de Gerland, and last season were knocked out of the competition at the last-16 stage for the sixth year in a row after losing the first leg 1-0. But this time, with Champions League-winning coach Jose Mourinho at the helm, the Spanish club have a better chance to end that poor run in next month's home leg after striker Benzema scored a vital away goal in France. The 23-year-old, who has struggled to win a regular place since his $50 million signing in 2009, was named as a substitute despite netting in Saturday's La Liga win over Levante. But he made an instant impact after replacing on-loan Togo forward Emmanuel Adebayor in the 64th minute -- within 60 seconds he burst into the area and poked a low shot over the line despite a desperate attempt to clear by Cris. ""At home, in the first leg, we would have preferred them not to score,"" Puel told reporters. ""It's a bit of a shame, especially because we played a great first half."" However, Lyon captain Cris made a vital contribution to last season's semifinalists'  83rd-minute leveler when he rose highest to head a deflected free-kick into the path of France striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who calmly volleyed past goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Gomis made amends for a poor first-half miss, having blazed a shot over the crossbar with the goal at his mercy in the 34th minute. Real will be left to rue two efforts that hit the woodwork five minutes after the break. First Cristiano Ronaldo smashed a free-kick against the far post following a booking to Lyon midfielder Michel Bastos that ruled the Brazilian out of the match at the Santiago Bernabeu on March 16. Then defender Sergio Ramos, who had just narrowly missed glancing in Ronaldo's curled effort, headed against the crossbar from Mesut Ozil's corner. ""In the second half we managed to find spaces and, to begin with, we were closer to a second goal than Lyon were to an equalizer,"" Mourinho told reporters. ""But it sets things up well for the second leg, where we will hope to qualify in front of our supporters."" Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti dropped striker Didier Drogba for the trip to Denmark, meaning $80 million signing Fernando Torres returned after being ineligible for the English FA Cup defeat by Everton on Saturday. But it was France forward Nicolas Anelka who stole the headlines with both goals in a 2-0 victory over Copenhagen, who were playing for the first time since December 5 due to the Danish winter break. Anelka broke the deadlock in the 17th minute with an opportunist effort after a loose pass by former Chelsea player Jesper Gronkjaer from near the halfway line gave the 31-year-old space to surge forward and drill a low shot past goalkeeper Johan Wiland. He was again on target nine minutes after the interval, firing his seventh goal of the competition this season from Frank Lampard's pass. He made way for Drogba in the 74th minute, then almost immediately Torres had a shot cleared off the line as Chelsea went on to complete a first win since February 1 to lift some of the pressure on Ancelotti ahead of the second leg at Stamford Bridge. Spain World Cup winner Torres is still looking for his first goal since leaving Liverpool three weeks ago and endured another frustrating night. ""He played very, very well,"" the Italian said. ""The key to this game was the work the strikers did, always dangerous. Torres was unlucky he didn't score, but had a fantastic game."" Chelsea's chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League were boosted on Tuesday night when London rivals Tottenham suffered a 3-1 defeat at lowly Blackpool in the English Premier League. Tottenham, who beat AC Milan in the Champions League last week, would have gone third above Manchester City with victory but instead remained two points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea -- who now have a game in hand. Blackpool captain Charlie Adam, who almost joined Tottenham on the last day of the January transfer window, opened the scoring with an 18th-minute penalty and striker D.J. Campbell continued his scoring run with the second goal just before halftime. Substitute Brett Ormerod made it 3-0 with 10 minutes to play, while Russia striker Roman Pavlyuchenko scored a consolation in time added on with a deflected long-range effort as he started in place of San Siro match-winner Peter Crouch. The victory lifted Blackpool into 12th place, five points above the relegation zone. Chelsea's aspirations face a big test next Tuesday at home to Premier League leaders Manchester United, who have a 12-point advantage over Ancelotti's defending champions and can extend that at Wigan on Saturday.","Bafetimbi Gomis scores with seven minutes left to give Lyon a 1-1 draw .

"(CNN) -- About this time last year, many American families were sharing Thanksgiving leftovers and curious conversations about a traffic accident involving the world's most famous golfer. Almost a year has passed since the Tiger Woods' car accident outside his Florida home that spiraled into a sex scandal that dominated headlines, ended his marriage and caused him to take a break from golf. While his story last year was filled with scandal, talk around the Thanksgiving table this year may be more about redemption. ""Obviously, this has been a very difficult year for me and my family, on and off the golf course,"" Woods wrote this week on his official website. The Thanksgiving-weekend accident last year outside the couple's home in Florida shattered Woods once tightly-controlled image and led to the golfer's admission that he had engaged in multiple affairs during his nearly six-year marriage. Authorities were alerted of the crash near Woods' Orlando-area home the morning after Thanksgiving. An initial police report said Woods pulled out of his driveway in a 2009 Cadillac SUV and struck a fire hydrant. Woods' wife told the police that she used a golf club to break out the rear window of the vehicle, then pulled the golfer from the SUV after she heard the accident from inside their home. The golfer suffered minor injuries from the single-vehicle accident and was treated and released from a hospital. But his problems were only beginning. On November 28, a day later, Woods declines to talk to the Florida highway patrol troopers about the accident. Police say Woods was found on the street unconscious after the crash. On November 30, Woods releases a statement praising his wife and saying the accident is a ""private matter."" He declines to talk to Florida highway patrol troopers for a third time. On December 2, Woods apologizes for ""transgressions"" that ""let his family down"" -- the same day a gossip magazine publishes a report alleging he had an affair. On December 8, Woods' mother-in-law is admitted to a hospital with stomach pains after a 911 call from the golfer's home. On December 12, Woods announces that he is taking ""an indefinite break"" from professional golf, according to a statement posted on his website. ""I am deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people, most of all my wife and children,"" the statement says. Woods has returned to golf and spoke recently on his website about the changes in his life. ""I got through the year, and I'm in a much better place than I was a year ago and my life has balance,"" he said.","Almost a year has passed since the Tiger Woods' car accident .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama spoke Thursday with the leaders of France, Italy and the United Kingdom on coordinating an international response to the crisis in Libya, the White House said. In separate phone conversations with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama ""expressed his deep concern with the Libyan government's use of violence which violates international norms and every standard of human decency, and discussed appropriate and effective ways for the international community to immediately respond,"" the White House statement said. While some critics say the Obama administration has been slow to react to the deteriorating situation in Libya, the statement said Thursday's discussions were to ""coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure that there is appropriate accountability."" ""The leaders discussed the range of options that both the United States and European countries are preparing to hold the Libyan government accountable for its actions, as well as planning for humanitarian assistance,"" the White House statement said. U.S. officials have said all options were under consideration, including sanctions and enforcement of a no-fly zone, to try to stop the Libyan government from attacking protesters. A statement by the French Embassy said Obama discussed steps the United States plans to take regarding Libya in his phone call with Sarkozy. ""President Sarkozy presented the measures currently being examined by the European Union at his behest, and which he hopes will be swiftly adopted,"" the statement said. ""President Obama presented the measures that the United States plans on taking."" Earlier Thursday, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters that a range of options were being discussed, but he refused to provide details or specify those receiving the most consideration. Carney said the goals of any U.S. response were to protect American citizens in Libya and compel the Libyan government to stop attacking its own people. ""What we have said is we're not going to specify which options are on or off the table. We're discussing a full range of options,"" Carney told reporters, adding that it was likely any action would be in concert with the international community. ""We're interested in outcomes,"" Carney said. ""We're interested in taking measures that will actually have the desired effect, which is getting the Libyan government to stop"" killing its own people. On Wednesday, Obama strongly condemned the use of violence on protesters in Libya and said a unified international response was forming. ""The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous, and it is unacceptable,"" Obama said in his strongest and most direct statements to date on the unrest in Libya. ""So are threats and orders to shoot peaceful protesters and further punish the people of Libya. These actions violate international norms and every standard of common decency. This violence must stop."" Flanked by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama said Libya's government ""must be held accountable"" for its failure to meet its responsibilities, and he emphasized a growing international chorus of condemnation against the situation. Clinton will travel to Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday to join a Human Rights Council meeting. The group, part of the United Nations, is negotiating a resolution on Libya, according to European diplomats who spoke to CNN. Among the elements under consideration for the resolution are a call on Libya to protect its citizens, condemnation of the violence and a demand for an international inquiry and access for humanitarian groups. The president's public statement before television cameras Wednesday was considered part of an administration effort to counter impressions of inaction and presidential silence involving Libya, with U.S. officials saying the government is considering a range of options to pressure Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Meanwhile, the United States has been struggling to evacuate its own citizens from the country. On Tuesday, the Libyan government refused permission for a U.S. charter to land in Tripoli. A chartered ferry with 285 people aboard, including 40 nonessential U.S. Embassy employees and family members, 127 American citizens and 118 citizens of other countries, was docked in Tripoli awaiting a break in the weather to travel to Malta, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: The White House says the leaders discussed a coordinated response .

"(CNN) -- Gasoline prices have jumped another nickel, to 55 cents a gallon more than a year ago, according to a study published Sunday. The average price for a gallon of regular is $3.18, the Lundberg Survey found. That's up 5 cents from two weeks ago, publisher Trilby Lundberg said. ""That is a significant bite for motorists considering the continued deep unemployment,"" Lundberg said. And it comes amid a ""very wide and deep glut of gasoline supply,"" she added. The spike is partly due to events in the Middle East and north Africa, Lundberg said. The most common benchmark for crude oil is West Texas Intermediate on the futures market. That crude is ""glutted, in serious oversupply,"" she said. ""But U.S. refiners use many other crudes, some of which have been jumping on Middle East tensions."" The gasoline glut has helped prevent prices from rising even more, she said. Gas prices may rise another nickel or dime in the coming weeks, Lundberg said. ""It would of course be far more if Middle East problems augmented and caused oil prices to skyrocket,"" she said. Prices at the pump have risen 49 cents a gallon since late September. The Lundberg Survey tallies average gas prices at thousands of gas stations nationwide. Here are the latest average prices in some U.S. cities: . -Billings, Montana - $2.95 . -San Francisco - $3.54 . -Houston - $2.98 . -St. Louis - $2.99 . -Tulsa, Oklahoma - $3.01 . -Baltimore - $3.09 . -Atlanta - $3.11 . -Boston - $3.21 . -Las Vegas - $3.20 . -Minneapolis - $3.18 .","Middle East tensions are behind the increase, survey publisher says .

Scott Walker into taking a prank call by posing as a billionaire conservative activist, told CNN Thursday that Walker is a ""delusional"" politician seeking to help wealthy GOP backers. Murphy, editor of the news website ""Buffalo Beast,"" posed as business tycoon David Koch while placing a call to Walker's office. He was able to secure a candid 20-minute conversation with the governor. In a transcript of the conversation on the website, Walker discusses the idea of bringing 14 Democratic state senators -- who left the state to prevent a quorum for discussing the budget bill -- back to the assembly to ""talk, not negotiate,"" allow them to recess, and then have the 19 Republican senators declare a quorum. At that point, presumably, the Republican-led Senate would be able to move forward on the controversial legislation, which would end the state's public union workers' collective bargaining rights on all matters but salaries and wages. It would also raise the amount they would have to pay into their pensions and health insurance plans. Murphy, posing as Koch, suggested ""planting some troublemakers"" among the people protesting the measure in Madison. ""We thought about that,"" Walker allegedly replied. The governor also drew an analogy between his standoff with the Wisconsin unions and President Ronald Reagan's decision to fire striking air traffic controllers in 1981. ""This is our moment,"" he said. ""This is our time to change the course of history."" ""I think (Walker) is truly a right-wing delusional person,"" Murphy told CNN. ""He believes in the fairy tale"" of conservative economic theory. ""But there's also got to be another part of him who believes he'll eventually profit (by breaking the unions) and so will the people who back him -- a la David Koch."" Murphy said he hopes ""the right thing will happen"" and ""the unions will come out on top."" ""My entire adult life has seemed like a series of moments where Democrats could have revitalized themselves and taken a stand,"" Murphy noted. ""But every time"" they've shifted to the political center ""and lost the opportunity."" As a result, ""the country's gone further to the right."" Walker confirmed Wednesday that he had been duped by Murphy. But the plan for getting 14 Democrats back into the Capitol to force a quorum on the controversial budget bill is not ""a trick,"" he insisted. It is part of a plan he has discussed publicly in the past, he said. ""I take phone calls all the time."" Walker said at a news conference. ""The things I said are the things I've said publicly all along. The fact of the matter is people have brought up all sorts of different options."" Walker continued: ""In terms of other ways to come on in, it's not a trick. We've said it point blank; come on in and talk about it, I'm willing to talk about it ... but I ultimately believe it needs to lead to a vote. I don't think that's a trick, I think that's something I've said time and time again in front of all of you here, and stated very frankly. ""Now, I'm not going to allow one prank phone call to be a distraction from the reality that we have a job to do, and the job is to debate this bill, and you're only able to debate it if you're in the Capitol, focused on the task at hand."" Walker raised the specter of layoffs ""that would affect 1,500 individuals"" if the Democratic senators do not return to Madison promptly. Describing the legislation as a necessary precursor to the process of producing a budget that addresses Wisconsin's $3.6 billion deficit, Walker on Wednesday said that if isn't passed by week's end, or ""we lose out on about $165 million in savings"" that the bill generates for debt restructuring, it could result in further layoffs. ""For us to lock in those savings, to have that done in anticipation of the budget bill, we need one thing and we need one thing in particular. And that is for those 14 state senators to come back to Wisconsin to debate this bill, to participate in democracy and to allow us to move forward, and to do ultimately the job they were elected to do,"" Walker said.","Ian Murphy calls Gov. Walker ""delusional"" and a ""right-winger""

"Fort Campbell, Kentucky (CNN)  -- Maylanie Shorter sleeps with a T-shirt tucked in her pillowcase. It carries the scent of her father's cologne while he's on patrol in Afghanistan. Her younger sister, Ariana, sleeps with her Daddy Doll -- a stuffed soldier that displays a photo of her father across its face. At 14 and 10, the two girls try to maintain normalcy. They're active in school, they help with dinner, they rally around their mother. And they show no mercy for Pops over the Silver Star he earned by saving several comrades whose armored Humvee was shredded by a roadside bomb. They tease him about a photo of the burned-out vehicle. ""How did you take this picture? Weren't you supposed to go get them and help?"" Ariana says. As much as the two laugh, in an instant, the giggles can turn into tears. They want to hold their father again, tickle his tummy. They really want to go fishing with him in their special spot. While Army Sgt. 1st Class Randy Shorter serves his third combat tour, the lives of his two young girls -- like the tens of thousands of other children with a parent deployed overseas -- are being changed and shaped by a war that is already the longest in U.S. history. For them, at tender ages, the war is personal. Heading to 'Hell on Earth' Four weeks earlier, the girls escorted their father across Fort Campbell to say goodbye. Dressed in his camouflage fatigues, Randy Shorter wrapped his arms around both his girls. ""You try to take it all in,"" he said. ""Take as much time with your family as you can."" Ariana had one arm around her dad; in the other, she clutched her Daddy Doll. Every now and then, she wiped away tears. ""All the emotions are wrapped up in this moment,"" said mother Sheryll Shorter, who married Randy 14 years ago. Randy wears four Silly Bandz bracelets on his right wrist -- one for each member of his family and the fourth for Diego, their bug-eyed Boston terrier. In the pocket over his heart, he carries photos of his children and wife. Roughly 17,000 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are deployed as part of the surge in Afghanistan. It marks one of the few times in history when nearly the entire division has been together in battle under one command. The 101st this summer has seen its highest three-month death toll in Afghanistan since the war began. Every soldier deploying knows the gravity of the situation. Home and away: Share memories of lost loved ones . As Sgt. 1st Class Shorter waited with his family, other members of his unit begin showing up in their fatigues. After tearful goodbyes, the soldiers headed to a gym. In their hands, they carried soldier readiness packets detailing their medical history, their dental records -- and their wills. The men represent the epitome of the American soldier -- hulking guys of all races with closely cropped hair, square jaws, and arms the size of pythons. They have an intensity on their faces, steeped in thought, many having to transition from fathers to warriors in an instant. By week's end, they will arrive in Afghanistan, ready to battle members of al Qaeda and Taliban fighters after an exhaustive series of flights with stops in Ireland, Romania and Kyrgyzstan along the way. Before shipping out, the soldiers gathered around Lt. Col. Joel Hamby. A giant American flag and a Screaming Eagle banner hung above them. ""Your job is to think about what's next, especially the platoon leaders,"" Hamby said. ""You are the very best, and I thank you for what you're doing today. OK? And I want to see all of you back here in a year."" A chaplain talked to the soldiers about their time overseas, especially those with children. ""Let them know you love them, care for them and miss them,"" said Capt. Bernard Buzulak. ""Don't isolate. Communicate."" Randy Shorter soon was on a plane with his comrades headed to a remote region of Afghanistan dubbed ""Hell on Earth."" They'll be there for a year. While his daughters have the Daddy Dolls and T-shirt to cling to, he has his own special mementos -- a trinket with a Psalm and letters from home. He keeps letters from Ariana, Maylanie and Sheryll in a chest pocket. He pulls them out for inspiration on rough days, when he's more than 7,500 miles from the ones he loves most, in the line of fire for his country. ""It brings a sense of home. It actually brings me peace."" On the battlefield, he often rubs the trinket, one of the few items he's carried on all three deployments. In Kentucky, his family prays and anxiously counts the days until they see him again. Missing their 'Chooby' Maylanie arrives home from Fort Campbell High School and immediately begins helping her mother prepare dinner. The family dog scurries along the floor, following her every movement. ""I'm not cutting onions,"" Maylanie tells her mom. She begins peeling potatoes. Her mother talks about what needs to get done and other activities for the rest of the week. ""There's gonna be a Wednesday candlelight vigil where they form the Spade,"" Sheryll says, referring to the ace of spades symbol for the 506th Regimental Combat Team. ""This is for what?"" Maylanie asks. ""Your dad."" Maylanie was 4 and had just started kindergarten when her father first deployed. She's now a bubbly teenager in her freshman year of high school. ""It's different now,"" she says. ""Even when he's not here, he's here in my heart, and that's what keeps me going. I pray for him every night and for his soldiers."" Her mom stays active volunteering with a Family Readiness Group, a support network that helps families cope while loved ones are deployed. Maylanie says she becomes closer to her mother and sister while her father is away. It's the first time she's lived on post during a deployment. That's helped too, because all the kids understand. Sometimes, she talks to the counselor at school. When she lived off post, her peers couldn't relate. ""They'd be like, 'Your dad's in Afghanistan. That's cool!' "" ""I try to keep myself busy,"" she says. ""In my down time, I do think about him a lot."" She pauses as she peels. ""Do you want these potatoes in a bowl?"" she asks her mother. Maylanie doesn't ask her dad about details from the war zone. ""It's probably not something comfortable to talk about with your kids."" She prefers to ask about the countryside of Afghanistan -- the mountains, the weather, the people. In the family living room, Sgt.1st Class Shorter's presence is everywhere. Photos of him in uniform hang on the wall. He has a shrine to Bob Marley; his favorite song is ""Buffalo Soldier."" One photo from Fort Benning, Georgia, in 2007 has an inscription: ""Thanks for the hard work and dedication, from one partner to another, Godspeed, stay safe and keep your head down."" Ariana soon arrives home from elementary school, one of five at Fort Campbell. As she comes through the front door, she passes a calendar counting the days until their father will return. He'll be home in March for R&R. It immediately becomes clear just how much these girls love their dad. Sitting on the living room couch, they begin a girl gab session. They reveal a secret: Dad's nickname is Chooby, short for Chubby Boobies. The two squeal with delight. ""He's ticklish,"" the younger Ariana says. ""Very ticklish,"" adds Maylanie. ""Like when we go out, he seems all strong and confident. So when he comes home and we tickle him, he's like a little girl! Because he screams. ... We know his weak side."" Ariana whispers. ""His secret dream is to go on ""American Idol"" and win."" Does he have a shot at winning? The two girls are harsher than ""Idol's"" Simon Cowell. They say their dad can't sing or dance. At stoplights, when their father is grooving in the car, they distance themselves. ""People will pull up and they'll just be like, 'What the heck is going on with him?' They probably think he's having a spaz attack,"" Maylanie says. ""Yeah,"" Ariana sighs. ""But we go along with it. We put up with him,"" Maylanie adds. Both girls have their own Daddy Dolls. Ariana takes hers when she has sleepovers at friends' houses. She also wraps herself in a blanket, the same one that kept her father warm in Afghanistan in 2008. ""It keeps me warm a lot,"" the 10-year-old says. Ariana buries her head in her hands, unable to speak, tears streaming down her face. When her younger sister struggles for words, Maylanie takes charge, showing a maturity well beyond her 14 years. ""Families that aren't in the military, they don't understand what you go through,"" she says. ""We don't want to spend our whole entire day thinking about Dad and worrying about him and wondering what he's doing and what he's going through. ... Like, we have to keep going forward, stay positive and just be strong."" Soon, the two are back to their routine. They bury themselves in homework. By night's end, Maylanie will place her head on her pillow, the cologne from her father's shirt comforting her. He was wearing the shirt in 2008 when he told his daughters he'd soon be heading to Afghanistan. ""We were tickling him in bed, and he was talking about deploying,"" Maylanie says. ""I cried on that T-shirt. ... It gives me security. It's from my dad, and my dad means everything.""

"New York (CNN) -- A woman suspected of snatching an infant from a New York hospital in 1987 told investigators she was frustrated with her inability to give birth, according to court papers filed Monday. Ann ""Annugetta"" Pettway has been charged with one count of kidnapping in the abduction of Carlina Renae White, who has since reunited with her biological mother. According to court documents filed in the case Monday, Pettway admitted to taking the girl from a Harlem hospital after suffering several miscarriages. Pettway, 49, made an initial appearance in federal court Monday afternoon to face the single kidnapping count. She did not speak or enter a plea during the five-minute hearing. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein ordered her held until a February 7 bail hearing. She was dressed in a blue jail uniform and did not look around as she was escorted into the courtroom. In their second-row seats, White's parents leaned forward for a better view of the woman accused of taking their daughter from them more than 23 years ago. During an interview with federal investigators Sunday, Pettway allegedly expressed remorse that she ""caused a lot of pain,"" court papers state. After the hearing, defense attorney Robert Baum said he believed Pettway did express remorse but would not say whether he would challenge her statement to investigators before reading the charging documents. ""A lot of facts here have yet to come out,"" Baum told reporters. He added, ""She's hopeful that the ending of this tragedy for everyone will shed new light on her role."" Regina Tyson, White's aunt, said her family wants to see prison time for Pettway. ""She should get 23 years -- the same amount of time she took away from my family,"" Tyson said. Pettway turned herself in Sunday morning at the FBI office in Bridgeport, Connecticut, FBI spokesman William Reiner said. She faces up to 20 years to life in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 if convicted. White tracked down her birth family in early January, saying she had had a nagging feeling all her life that she was brought up by a family to which she didn't belong. Ernie Allen, president and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said White's suspicions grew after the woman who raised her could not produce a birth certificate for her. Court documents state Pettway tried unsuccessfully several times to forge the document. Janice Fedarcyk, the No. 1 official in the FBI's New York office, called the kidnapping ""an unimaginable trauma"" for White's parents. ""In a calculated deception, she was raised as the child of the woman now charged with her kidnapping,"" Fedarcyk said in a statement issued Monday afternoon. ""Those 23 years cannot be restored, but unlike most child abductions, this one, at long last, has a happy ending."" White's mother, Joy White, told the New York Post last week that she last saw her daughter when she was 19 days old. She took her to a Harlem hospital on August 4, 1987, because the baby had a high fever, a New York police official said. Carlina was admitted to the hospital, and her mother went home to rest. When she returned, the baby was gone. ""That was a big part of my heart that was just ripped apart,"" Carlina White's biological father, Carl Tyson, told the Post regarding her disappearance. Carlina White told the Post that Pettway raised her. Pettway was pregnant in 1987, she said, but lost the baby. Pettway later acknowledged that she was not White's biological mother, claiming she was given to her as an infant by a woman who was ""on drugs,"" according to the court documents. ""I just started typing in Yahoo and Google different articles -- anything that pulled up in 1987 with any child that went missing -- and I came across the article, and the baby picture just struck me because ... it looked like my daughter,"" White, who has a 5-year-old daughter, told the Post. On January 4, Joy White's phone rang. The woman on the other end said she was Carlina, and sent a picture taken in 1987 in which she bore a striking resemblance to a baby picture Joy White had held onto. A DNA test proved the link. The family has since been joyously reunited. ""This is what I wanted ever since I found out that lady wasn't my biological mother,"" Carlina White told the Post. CNN's Stephanie Gallman, Raelyn Johnson and Nina Golgowski contributed to this report .","Ann Pettway was frustrated by her inability to give birth, court documents say .

"(CNN) -- The December death of a 27-year-old woman at the Missouri home of beer tycoon August Busch IV was ruled an accident, a medical examiner said Wednesday. Adrienne Nicole Martin died of an oxycodone overdose, the St. Louis County Office of the Medical Examiner said in a statement. She was found dead December 19 at Busch's Frontenac, Missouri, home, authorities said. The medical examiner's office said that information, and its complete report, was forwarded to the law enforcement agencies investigating Martin's death. Police responded to a call from the home about an unresponsive woman, authorities said. ""This girl is not waking up,"" Michael Jung, a home staff employee at the Busch estate, told the operator. ""Is she breathing""? the 911 operator asked Jung. ""We don't know,"" Jung replied. ""It's dark. I'm going to get a light to see."" The call ended after the operator told Jung an ambulance had been sent to the property. Martin had no apparent signs of trauma or other indications of cause of death, police said. Oxycodone is a narcotic pain medication. Busch's lawyer, Art Margulis, described Martin as a friend of his client's. ""There's absolutely nothing here that would indicate that this occurred under any suspicious circumstances,"" Margulis said at the time. ""It's a tragic death of a ... very nice young lady."" Frontenac, a community of about 3,500 people, is 11 miles west of St. Louis. Martin was a model and aspiring art therapist, described as Native American on her page on iStudio.com, which says it serves ""the modeling, photography, and associated industries."" In the About Me section of her page, she wrote that she had been in beauty pageants for years and ""would really like to do beer advertising."" Busch, 46, became chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch in December 2006, after years of working in the company's brewing, operations and marking divisions. He was in charge in 2008 when Belgian brewer InBev engineered a $52 billion takeover of the then-St. Louis-based, company. With that move, the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev became the world's largest brewer. That also largely ended the Busch family's long legacy in brewing, namely heading the legendary eastern Missouri institution known for its Budweiser and other brands. The story started with Adolphus Busch, the company founder and August Busch IV's great-grandfather. August Busch IV is the only representative of the family -- and its former namesake company -- on the Anheuser-Busch InBev board of directors.","Adrienne Martin died of an oxycodone overdose, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Two dozen lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia have a new home in Colorado, where they will live outside of cages and roar at the distant Rocky Mountains. Animal Defenders International (ADI) brought them last week to Denver, where they were transported to the Wild Animal Sanctuary, to conclude its ""Operation Lion Ark."" The flight followed the passage of a 2009 law in Bolivia that bans the use of any animals in circuses. The 25 felines are currently housed in a 15,000-square-foot temporary biosphere, complete with grass, trees and other natural features, at the sanctuary in Keenesburg, about 30 miles northeast of Denver. They're sleeping better, are getting exercise and have begun to roar in unison, ""which demonstrates they are beginning to bond as we expected,"" said Pat Craig, executive director of the sanctuary. The ADI campaign and airlift got a big financial boost from TV game show host Bob Barker. Barker and actress Jorja Fox of ""CSI"" described the campaign Wednesday night on HLN's ""Jane Velez-Mitchell. ""It is a true testament to the Bolivian people what they were able to accomplish quickly,"" Fox said of the law and the rescue of the lions, which were part of eight circuses. Of the 25 lions, 24 were seized from circuses, many the traveling variety. Eight were living in a cage pulled by a truck, Fox said, and at least two had never seen other lions. The sanctuary is building a permanent 80-acre fenced site for the lions, which will live in four prides, Craig told CNN. They'll get along just fine with the climate in Colorado, he said, because they are exposed to the cold in North Africa. Living in Bolivia put them in a much warmer climate that will require acclimation until they are released into the permanent living area in late March or April. ""It was a surprise to me to know that lions are genetically wired for winter,"" said Fox. The 320-acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands, split into habitats, houses more than 275 large carnivores, including bears, tigers and other big cats. The Wild Animal Sanctuary emphasizes its mission is to serve as a sanctuary, not for entertainment. ""It's a home for animals, not a zoo for people,"" Craig said. Animal rights activists and groups are optimistic that Bolivia's 2009 action will lead other countries to ban animals in circuses and change conditions in zoos. ""I'm against zoos. I consider them prisons for animals,"" Barker told HLN. The sanctuary uses proceeds from its annual 50,000 visitors to cover the costs of their visit, Craig said. ""We hope they become long-term contributors."" About 80 percent of the carnivores at the facility, which costs about $2.5 million a year to operate, were in the United States when they were seized from deplorable or illegal situations, he added. Most of the lions will have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That's largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population. Lionesses receive estrogen implants so that they won't go into heat. That reduces the competition and fighting among males. Craig praised Bolivia for taking action. ""This is the first country that stepped up,"" he said. He expects Peru, Ecuador and other countries to take steps that eliminate or limit the use of animals in circuses and other entertainment venues. Cities and states in the United States are taking a hard look at the treatment of elephants and carnivores, according to Craig. The 25 lions are adjusting well, appear calm and enjoy stretching their legs while running and playing. ""Like many rescued animals that come from extreme captive situations, they are quickly accepting all of the positive changes that are happening,"" Craig told CNN. ""There is nowhere to go but up when you have lived at the bottom, so they are open to grasping every opportunity to enjoy life that we present. This will continue all the way until they are roaming freely in large acreage habitats, when they can complete their journey.""

"(CNN) -- Protests in Tunisia turned violent and deadly Saturday, just over six weeks after a popular uprising forced the president out of office, and lit a spark of desire for democratic reform in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Three people were killed Saturday and nine others injured during mayhem in the capital, Tunis, according to a Interior Ministry statement cited by the state-run news agency, Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP). More than 100 people were arrested, the ministry said, in the area around Habib Bourguiba Avenue, in the city's center, accused of ""acts of destruction and burning."" Protesters had gathered in the area to demand that the interim government step down and the current parliament be disbanded. Demonstrators were also asking for suspension of the current constitution and the election of an assembly that can write a new one, as well as organize the transition to democracy. Several people infiltrated peaceful demonstrators in the Tunisian capital ""to commit acts of disturbance, burning and looting,"" according to TAP, which also reported that a cylinder of liquefied petroleum gas exploded in front of a building along the avenue. There are rumors in Tunis that the violence was perpetrated by people who are still loyal to ousted President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and want to spread chaos and nostalgia for the old regime. Similar violence broke out in the same area on Friday night as well, according to TAP. The agency cites an Interior Ministry source that claims acts of vandalism and destruction along the avenue resulted in injuries to 21 policemen. Protests in Tunisia erupted late last year. Fed up with corruption, unemployment and escalating prices of food, people began demonstrating en masse after the self-immolation suicide of a fruit cart vendor in December. By January 13, Ben Ali -- who had ruled Tunisia since 1987 -- turned executive power over to his prime minister and fled the country.

"(CNN)   -- Australia captain Ricky Ponting was reprimanded Wednesday by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for damaging a television after being dismissed at the World Cup. Ponting had made 28 in his side's match against Zimbabwe at the Gujarat Stadium in Ahmedabad Monday when he was run out attempting a second run. Clearly angry with himself as he walked off, Ponting reacted with fury when he saw a replay of the incident on a television in the dressing room. He hurled a piece of his equipment which bounced off his kit bag and hit the corner of the LCD screen. Initial reports inaccurately claimed Ponting had smashed up the television with his bat, but the damage he caused did prompt an official complaint from the Gujarat Cricket Association. A statement released to CNN from the ICC, said Ponting had accepted a Level 1 charge, which carries a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of his match fee. ""Ricky knows that his action was in breach of the code, involving a brief moment of frustration,"" said match referee Roshan Mahanama. He added: ""It was clear that the damage he caused was purely accidental and without malice, he apologized shortly after the incident at the ground and immediately agreed to pay for the damage."" Ponting was found to have breached an ICC rule which relates to ""abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match"". Despite the incident, Australia comfortably won their Group A opener by 91 runs as the 36-year-old Ponting bids to be the first man to captain a side to three straight World Cu triumphs. Australia play New Zealand in Nagpur Friday in their second group clash. In Wednesday's action on the field, Pakistan crushed Kenya by 205 runs in Group A, recovering from the loss of two early wickets in Hambantota in Sri Lanka. Kenya did not assist their cause by conceding 46 extras as Pakistan scored    317 for 7 in their 50 overs with half centuries for Kamran Akmal, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal. Captain Shahid Afridi then took five wickets for 16 as Kenya crumbled to 112 all out for a second straight loss after going down by 10 wickets to New Zealand in their opener.","Ricky Ponting reprimanded by the ICC for damaging dressing room television .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran hanged two men Monday for their actions during post-election unrest in 2009, state media reported, months after the United States' secretary of state called for Iran to drop the ""imminent"" executions. Iran's Press TV described the men as terrorists and members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO). Jafar Kazemi and Mohammad Ali Haj Aqaei were hanged on Monday ""for distributing placards and photos of the terrorist group, making videos and images during the post-election unrest in Iran in 2009 and chanting slogans in favor of the MKO,"" the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. In an August 2010 statement, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the Iranian government to halt the executions of the men who were ""exercising their right to free expression."" ""The United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights and intimidate and detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and stand up for the rights of their fellow citizens,"" the statement read. ""... We are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right to free expression after the June 2009 elections, including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad Haj Aghaei, and Javad Lari.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States Mint launched a new coin Tuesday featuring jazz legend Duke Ellington, making him the first African-American to appear by himself on a circulating U.S. coin. The District of Columbia coin honoring Duke Ellington was introduced Tuesday in Washington. Ellington, the composer of classics including ""It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing"" appears on the ""tails"" side of the new D.C. quarter. George Washington is on the ""heads"" side, as is usual with U.S. quarters. The coin was issued to celebrate Ellington's birthplace, the District of Columbia. U.S. Mint Director Ed Moy introduced the new coin at a news conference Tuesday at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. Members of Ellington's family were present at the ceremony, and the jazz band of Duke Ellington High School performed. Ellington won the honor by a vote of D.C. residents, beating out abolitionist Frederick Douglass and astronomer Benjamin Banneker. Also on the coin is the phrase ""Justice for all."" The Mint rejected the first inscription choice of D.C. voters, which was ""taxation without representation,"" in protest of the district's lack of voting representation in Congress. Edward Kennedy ""Duke"" Ellington received 13 Grammy Awards and a Pulitzer Prize, among numerous other honors. His orchestra's theme song, ""Take the A Train,"" is one of the best-known compositions in jazz. Ellington was born in the district in 1899 and composed more than 3,000 songs, including ""Satin Doll,"" ""Perdido"" and ""Don't Get Around Much Any More."" ""It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing"" helped usher in the swing era of jazz. Ellington performed with other famous artists, including John Coltrane, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, and he traveled around the world with his orchestras. He died in 1974 at the age of 75. The first African-American to appear on a circulating coin was York, a slave who accompanied Lewis and Clark on their ""Corps of Discovery"" adventures across America at the dawn of the 19th century. The 2003 Missouri quarter features the three men together in a canoe on the obverse.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Police on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius said Tuesday they were treating the death of a Gaelic football star's wife during their honeymoon as murder. Michaela Harte, a 27-year-old teacher, was found dead in her luxury hotel room on Monday by her husband of two weeks, John McAreavey. A post-mortem revealed the former beauty queen had been strangled, according to police. Mauritius Police Force Superintendent Yoosoof Soopun said Tuesday that officers had identified six potential suspects. He said police believe robbery might have been a motive and were questioning hotel staff. Soopun said McAreavey was in the restaurant of the hotel when his wife was killed and is not a suspect. ""She had gone back to the room to get some biscuits to put in her tea, and when she failed to return, her husband went to look for her,"" Soopun said. ""When he found her in the room, she had been killed. He tried to help her, but she was already dead."" Soopun said the killer used an electronic key card to enter the room. ""This is being viewed with much concern by the police and the government of Mauritius,"" Soopun said. ""We are doing everything we can to find whoever was responsible. The inquiry is progressing, and we are confident it will reach a successful conclusion."" Monday night, John McAreavey -- the Catholic Bishop of Dromore and the football star's uncle and namesake -- said the family did not know the full facts of the death. ""The biggest struggle today was to cope with what happened,"" he said. ""There will come a time when people will want to get answers to questions."" Harte was the daughter of one of the best-known figures in Irish sports, Tyrone Gaelic football manager Mickey Harte. In a written statement, Harte said his family was ""devastated,"" and he offered support to his son-in-law. ""What a day she had on her wedding day. She was just radiant, a beautiful girl, and I just love her to bits. So did her whole family,"" Harte said. ""We will miss her so much,"" he added. ""This is the worst nightmare that anyone can imagine. If you think things can be bad, then you go beyond that because that is where we are. ""This is too horrible to contemplate. We are just all devastated. It is the worst of the worst and our hearts are broken,"" he said. Harte asked the media to refrain from contacting his son-in-law, who's ""isolated out there"" in Mauritius, he said. ""Our hearts go out to him,"" Harte said. ""The lad is devastated. He is our son-in-law. He is a wonderful young man. Please lay off."" On Monday evening, Harte also issued a joint statement with Bishop McAreavey. ""We wish to confirm that we have received confirmation this afternoon that Michaela was killed today in Mauritius where the couple were on honeymoon,"" the statement read. ""We ask for prayers for Michaela, John and their families and loved ones. ""Both families are deeply shocked and devastated by this tragic news and they ask for privacy and space at this time of profound grief."" Michaela Harte taught Irish at St Patrick's Girls Academy in Dungannon, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland. She won the Ulster Rose of Tralee contest and was a former Rose of Tralee contestant.","NEW: ""This is too horrible to contemplate. We are just all devastated,"" her father says .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It is Friday, and it is awesome! Thank you for rounding out your week with CNN Student News. From the CNN Center in Atlanta, Georgia, I'm Carl Azuz. Let's get to today's headlines. First Up: China Relations . AZUZ: First up, President Hu heads to the Hill. The Chinese leader wrapping up his visit to Washington, D.C. yesterday. The reception he got when he met with congressional leaders on Capitol Hill, not necessarily a warm one. Democratic and Republican leaders raised some of the strong concerns they have about China's policies on human rights and economic issues. It was a different story Wednesday night at the White House, when President Hu was the guest of honor at a formal state dinner with President Obama you see here. These are special events, these state dinners, for world leaders when they visit the United States. The White House hadn't hosted one for China since 1997. During his time in Washington, President Hu talked about China's role as one of the biggest economic powers in the world. Some of China's economic policies are frustrating some officials and companies in the United States, and Brian Todd explains why. (BEGIN VIDEO) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: At the White House, the dignified pageantry of a state visit for China's president, Hu Jintao. But just under the surface, smoldering resentment towards the Chinese in the halls of American government and business. Accusations of currency manipulation, unfair barriers to American businesses in China, and American products being copied or ripped off. Bootlegged DVDs of the latest Hollywood releases are sometimes available on Chinese streets before they even open in American theaters. American companies developing electronics, prescription drugs and software have similar complaints. The Chinese government even engages in some of this practice, right? FRED BERGSTEN, PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS: The Chinese government has laws that protect intellectual property, but in practice, enforcement is very lax. And in some cases, Chinese government agencies, including military agencies, will sometimes rip off the intellectual property themselves. TODD: Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute says the Chinese steal American intellectual property by reverse engineering: buying American products, figuring out how they're put together. Then they make those parts themselves at a cheaper cost. Then there are complaints about China's trade rules. Take a company like Marlin Steel Products in Baltimore, where 20 percent of revenue comes from exports. Company president Drew Greenblatt says he'd like to export to China, but the Chinese have a rule that many products sold to government agencies there, or which get tax breaks, have to be made completely in China. Known as the ""indigenous innovation policy,"" it stacks the deck against American companies like Marlin Steel. There's a direct impact, Greenblatt says, on American jobs. GREENBLATT: For every million dollars in new exports I get, I'm going to hire about eight more people. TODD: Chinese officials say their trade policies are not unfair, and they're stepping up enforcement of intellectual property laws. But the list of American complaints may prompt action from Congress, especially newly empowered Republican leaders in the House. What are you and other congressional leaders prepared to do to put more pressure on China to level this playing field? REP. CHARLES BOUSTANY, (R) LOUISIANA: We're going to continue to work, looking at our trade law, what we have to enforce trade agreements. We're going to continue to really pressure Chinese leaders, whether it's coming from Congress or from the administration, on this indigenous innovation policy and meeting their agreements under the WTO, the World Trade Organization agreements. TODD: But taking action against China is not risk free. Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute says, as the second biggest economy in the world right now, the Chinese have a lot of clout, that they can and will retaliate. They'll block U.S. exports, they'll reduce their investments in American securities. The Chinese are America's biggest banker in the world by far, Bergsten says, and right now, they have a lot of leverage. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO) Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The U.S. vice president oversees the U.S. House of Representatives. Not true! That part of Congress is overseen by the Speaker of the House. Health Care Vote . AZUZ: Republican John Boehner is currently serving in the role as speaker of the House. And earlier this week, he oversaw a House vote to repeal President Obama's controversial health care reform law. This law is widely considered to be President Obama's biggest U.S. accomplishment while he was president. House Republicans are working to come up with some replacement plans for the law. But as Samantha Hayes explains, the idea of repealing the existing law altogether might not go any further than it already has. (BEGIN VIDEO) SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: It may turn out to be largely symbolic, but House Republicans, along with three Democrats, voted Wednesday to repeal the health care law championed by President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress. The vote, 245 to 189, was mostly along party lines. It's the culmination of a campaign promise Republicans made ahead of the November midterm elections. The next step for the newly passed legislation is all but certain: the Senate likely won't even take it up. Earlier Wednesday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor challenged his Democratic counterpart in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, to consider the bill. REP. ERIC CANTOR, (R) MAJORITY LEADER: And leader Reid continues to say that he is not going to bring this up for a vote in the Senate. The American people deserve a full hearing. They deserve to see this legislation go to the Senate for a full vote. HAYES: A new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll shows 50 percent of Americans favor getting rid of the law. But for Democrats, defending the president's top domestic achievement is paramount. REP. ROBERT ANDREWS, (D) NEW JERSEY: I think what is picking up steam is the understanding that this repeal hurts the middle class of this country. REP. JOHN LARSON, (D) CONNECTICUT: This is not about campaign promises. This is about real people experiencing real problems in real time that we need to address. HAYES: Most Republicans acknowledge that an outright repeal is highly unlikely and will instead focus on finding ways to cut funding for the law. For CNN Student News, I'm Samantha Hayes. (END VIDEO) Mafia Raids . AZUZ: Federal agents carry out a huge raid on suspected Mafia members and take dozens of people into police custody. Kinda sounds like something out of a movie, and some of the suspects arrested yesterday probably wish it was. Officials are calling this one of the biggest, single-day operations against the mafia in FBI history. More than a hundred people with alleged ties to the mob were arrested across parts of New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and even Italy. The charges include drug trafficking, illegal gambling, extortion, arson and murder. Some of those charges go back to 1981. Officials say organized crime -- the mob -- is an ongoing threat, but that yesterday's raids made a serious dent against that threat. Shoutout . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Which of these terms describes a low-level crime? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Felony, B) Habeus corpus, C) Capital offense or D) Misdemeanor? You've got three seconds -- GO! A misdemeanor is a low-level crime. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Ticketing Students . AZUZ: So, for examples of a misdemeanor: They might include vandalism; they might include trespassing. In parts of Texas, you can add disrupting class or using profanity to that list. Instead of getting sent to the principal's office, students who act up are issued tickets and could end up in court in some places! They could face fines of up to $500. This policy isn't new; it's been going on for a while there. Some parents aren't happy about it. They argue that schools and parents -- not the court system -- should help students figure out right from wrong. A school district in Dallas issued a statement saying, ""The vast majority of our students are not disruptive. Those who do receive tickets are hopefully learning that their actions have consequences."" Promo . AZUZ: You know what comes next. Go to CNNStudentNews.com and tell us what you think of this story! Our blog is the perfect place for you to sound off on ticketing as a method of discipline. And if you don't like it, tell us what should be done instead. Also, you should totally introduce our show.

Before We Go . AZUZ: And before we go today, they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. In this guy's case, his good looks are also at the mercy of the sun. Students heading back for the spring semester at Notre Dame were greeted by this frosty fellow. His eyes are made of coal; yeah, that's pretty predictable. But the nose is a traffic cone. And the hat, well, that's from the sculpture that this gigantic snowman was built around. Goodbye . AZUZ: It's a cool idea. We just hope no one got confused and thought it was a real person. Although if they did, you know what we'd have to tell them: That's no man! It's the kind of story you can always say you thaw on CNN Student News. We're gonna go chill out.

"(CNN) -- President Obama delivered his long-awaited and wide-ranging speech Thursday on American and Muslim relations, offering a hand of friendship to Islam and addressing an array of quandaries and conflicts dividing the two cultures. President Obama urges a new chapter in ties between the U.S. and Muslims in a speech Thursday in Cairo, Egypt. At Egypt's Cairo University, Obama quoted from the Quran as he expounded on Islam's glories and rights, the legitimate rights of Israel and the Palestinians, Iranian nuclear aspirations, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's rights, economic development, and religious rights and democracy in the Muslim world. The address, billed as a fence-mending mission between the United States and Islam, urged those present and the people across the globe viewing the speech on television to enter a new, productive and peaceful chapter in their relationship. Obama's stop in Egypt is part of a trip that started in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and will continue later to Germany and France.  Watch Obama's entire speech » . ""I know there are many -- Muslim and non-Muslim -- who question whether we can forge this new beginning,"" Obama said, emphasizing that ""it is easier to start wars than to end them. It is easier to blame others than to look inward, to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share."" Obama reiterated a statement he made in Turkey in April. ""In Ankara, I made clear that America is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam. ""We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security -- because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men, women and children. And it is my first duty as president to protect the American people."" Obama explored the Palestinian and Israeli conflict, endorsing a two-state solution and urging compromise and understanding between ""two peoples with legitimate aspirations."" iReport.com: A reaction to Obama's speech . And then he entered into the conflict's thickets, understanding claims from both sides. He said the United States ""does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements"" seen by Muslims as impediments to Middle East peace.  Watch as Obama seeks a ""new beginning"" » . ""This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop."" Calling America's ""strong bond"" with Israel ""unbreakable,"" he said, ""It is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied."" He denounced the denial of the Holocaust and anti-Semitic stereotyping, and criticized anyone who would threaten Israel's destruction. Expounding on the plight of Palestinians, Obama said ""it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people -- Muslims and Christians -- have suffered in pursuit of a homeland."" ""For more than 60 years they have endured the pain of dislocation. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead,"" he said.  Watch Obama discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict » . ""They endure the daily humiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation. So let there be no doubt: The situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity and a state of their own."" Obama also denounced Palestinian violence and the rejection by some of Israeli existence -- both seen by Israel as obstacles to peace. The president conjured the lessons of America's civil rights movement when he urged Palestinians to ""abandon violence."" ""Resistance through violence and killing is wrong, and it does not succeed. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation,"" he said. ""It was not violence that won full and equal rights. It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America's founding."" The conflict, Obama said, needs to be seen from a larger perspective, not from the viewpoint of one side or another. And both sides must live up to the responsibilities of the moribund ""road map"" peace process, he said.  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Obama's message of detente » . He added that the Hamas movement -- which controls Gaza -- and has some support among Palestinians must end violence and recognize past agreements. He also urged Arab states to no longer use the conflict to distract their peoples from other problems. ""The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security,"" he said. Obama talked about the importance of confronting violent extremism, touching on the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Emphasizing the fact that the United States entered Afghanistan by ""necessity"" and not ""choice,"" he countered the stances of some ""who ""question or justify the events of 9/11."" ""But let us be clear: Al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day. The victims were innocent men, women and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody. And yet al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with,"" he said. Obama said the United States does not seek to keep its troops in Afghanistan or establish military bases there but needs to continue the fight against ""extremists,"" with both military power and investment in the infrastructure and economy of Pakistan and Afghanistan. ""It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women. It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict. We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can. But that is not yet the case,"" he said. He addressed the conflict in Iraq, calling it unlike Afghanistan ""a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world."" ""Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible,"" he said. He said the United States needs to help Iraq ""forge a better future and leave Iraq to Iraqis."" ""I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources. Iraq's sovereignty is its own. That is why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July, and to remove all our troops from Iraq by 2012."" Speaking about prohibiting torture and the closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility, Obama talked about working on ""concrete actions to change course"" and correct abuses in the war on terror. ""Just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter our principles. 9/11 was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals,"" he said. Obama dwelled on the tensions over nuclear weapons between the United States and Iran and the ""tumultuous history"" between the countries. He pointed to the U.S. role in overthrowing a democratically elected government during the Cold War era and Iran's role in hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians since the Islamic revolution in 1979. The president reiterated his desire to move forward with Iran on many issues, saying the ""question, now, is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build."" ""But it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisive point. This is not simply about America's interests. It is about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path."" The United States and other Western nations have opposed what they believe are Iran's intentions to develop nuclear weapons. Obama said that any nation, including Iran, ""should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."" He said such a ""commitment"" is at the treaty's core and ""it must be kept for all who fully abide by it."" ""And I am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal,"" Obama said.","President Obama touches on Iran, Mideast conflict, wars in Iraq, Afghanistan .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Hollywood A-listers Antonio Banderas and Freida Pinto kept working on a new movie in Tunisia even as the country was beset by turmoil and protests, and its president fled to Saudi Arabia. The actors were shooting a film on location near Hammamet -- one of the towns caught up in rioting and looting. The film ""Black Gold"" is a drama set in Arabia during the 1930s when oil was discovered -- a watershed development for the entire region. Its stars include Banderas, Pinto, Mark Strong and French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim and is directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud -- veteran of such films as ""The Name of the Rose"", ""Enemy at the Gates"" and ""Seven Years in Tibet."" CNN's feature show ""Inside the Middle East"" was shooting an exclusive feature on the making of the film when the unrest escalated around the country -- four days before President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. At the time, the cast and crew expressed concern about the developments but were determined to continue with the production. When asked whether, as an international actor, he was concerned about working in Tunisia, Banderas told CNN: . ""Yes. Of course. I hope that everything comes to terms. I hope that both sides -- in the problems that they're having right now -- have an open hand to understand each other's position, and I hope that they start believing very much in the young people because these are the people that are going to be running this country in the future. They have to believe in them they have to bat for them."" The crew was still shooting during the dramatic developments last Friday and continued the following day. A spokesman said the actors followed events on TV and on the internet, and were offered the chance to leave but decided to stay. He said the overseas actors were concerned for their Tunisian colleagues but there was no panic. Banderas flew to France for business reasons but planned to return to the set on Thursday to wrap filming in Tunisia. The lavish set is part of Empire Studios, the brainchild of Tarak Ben Ammar, the biggest name in Tunisian cinema and a producer on many films including ""The Last Legion"" and Monty Python's ""Life of Brian."" He's also a nephew of Tunisia's first president, Habib Bourgiba -- the man replaced by Ben Ali 23 years ago. Ben Ammar welcomed the developments as a great opportunity for democracy in Tunisia and hoped his country -- which provided the locations for ""Star Wars,"" ""The English Patient"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" -- would remain a popular destination for international movie-makers in the future.","Hollywood A-list star Antonio Banderas was shooting a movie in Tunisia .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Israel's president called the presence of Iranian warships in the Suez Canal a ""provocation"" and not a serious ""threat,"" but he warned an audience of Europeans that they face an ""existential"" danger from the regime's nuclear program. In Iran, a military commander expressed patriotic pride over the development: the first Iranian vessels to sail through the Suez since the Islamic republic's 1979 revolution. The rhetoric from the two Mideast enemies flowed after two Iranian ships sailed through the Suez Canal Tuesday on their way to the Mediterranean Sea. The move, which occurred four days after Egypt's post-Hosni Mubarak government gave the green light to their passage, put Egypt's new military regime in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor. Israeli President Shimon Peres, speaking on Wednesday at a meeting with government leaders, diplomats and journalists in Madrid, said that while Iran's Suez trip was a ""cheap provocation,"" it is not by itself a serious ""threat."" ""The real threat stands as a clear warning sign to you and the entire world -- Iran is developing nuclear weapons of mass destruction,"" Peres said, according to a statement from his office citing his comments. ""When nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terror organizations, or Iranian proxies, European capitals will be under an existential threat. Spain has suffered terribly from terror attacks and this will be the lot of many other countries in the world if they do not take drastic measures against Iran. Iran desires to take over the entire Middle East and impose its radical religious hegemony on the inhabitants of the Middle East,"" he said, according to the statement. The commander of Iran's navy said Tuesday that ""the presence"" of the ships in the Suez means Iran can ""turn threats into opportunities."" ""Iran has always proved that, with guidance of the supreme leader and awareness and intelligence of young people, has reached self-confidence, and the presence of Iran's Navy flotilla in the Suez Canal is another proof,"" Fars News Agency reported. The vessels, a frigate and supply ship, are on a yearlong intelligence-gathering mission to prepare cadets to defend Iran's cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by Somali pirates, Iranian officials have said, according to Fars. The Khark and the Alvand, which passed through the canal without incident, are headed to Syria, Fars said, citing officials. The Khark has 250 crew members and can carry three helicopters. Alvand is armed with torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, Fars said. Egypt has sovereignty over the canal. But the country also is bound by the 1978 Camp David Accords, which guarantee the right of free passage by ships belonging to Israel and all other nations on the basis of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to sail through the canal. The Suez Canal is a key waterway for international trade. It connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go around Africa. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day en route to Europe and North America.","Shimon Peres says the ""real threat"" is Iran's nuclear program .

"(CNN) -- Navy police shot one sailor in the gut and took another into custody early Saturday after their vehicle smashed into two police cruisers following a chase at San Diego's naval base, a military spokesman said. The wounded sailor is in stable condition at the University of California San Diego Medical Center after undergoing surgery, said Brian O'Rourke, the Navy's public affairs officer for the southwest region. The other sailor was uninjured. No charges have been filed against either the driver, who was shot, or his passenger. O'Rourke said that they had been stopped around 1:30 a.m. at a gate outside the San Diego Naval Base on strong suspicions of drunken driving. A gate guard then called for assistance from Navy police units. But before a Breathalyzer could be given, the driver sped inside the base and was soon pursued by military police. The sailors tried to go through another gate, which had been shut down according to protocol, but instead slammed into the security vehicles, O'Rourke said. The passenger then got out of the car, but the driver continued. Naval police officers then opened fire, eventually hitting that sailor in the abdomen. In a statement, the Navy said its police decided to use ""deadly force"" after determining ""the driver represented a threat to the lives of officers."" The passenger is being held on base, the biggest on the West Coast and home to 59 ported ships and thousands of sailors. O'Rourke said police and others at the base just finished a week of security training, preparing them for an incident like this. Formal charges -- which have not yet been specified -- are likely to be filed Monday against the car's driver and possibly its passenger, the spokesman said.","A Navy sailor had surgery and is stable at a hospital after being shot in the abdomen .

"(CNN) -- A pirate was killed and several others were detained after a security team thwarted an attack in waters off Somalia, authorities said Wednesday. The incident happened Tuesday as a Panamanian-flagged cargo ship, the MV Almezaan, was headed to Mogadishu, said the European Union Naval Force. A private security team that was on board the ship returned fire when pirates tried to attack the vessel. The security team was able to repel two attack attempts. The EU naval force was called in, boarded the three pirate ships and detained six suspects. They also found one pirate who had died of a gunshot wound, the naval force said. No further details were immediately available about his death. The waters off the Somali coast -- the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean -- have been plagued by Somali pirates. The international community has adopted measures such as escorts and monitoring to crack down on piracy. Two cargo ships were seized in the area on Tuesday, the EU naval force reported. Hijackers took control of one ship in the Indian Ocean and were apparently taking it to Somalia, EUNAVFOR said. The MV Frigia, a Turkish-owned and Maltese-flagged cargo vessel, had been headed east from Port Said in Egypt to Kaousichang in Thailand. The ship was moving west and appeared to be heading toward one of the so-called pirate ports off the coast of Somalia. There are 21 crew members on the ship, 19 Turkish and two Ukrainian. Also, the Bermuda-flagged and Virgin Islands-owned MV Talca was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden, EU NAVFOR said. That hijacking took place off the coast of Oman and 180 miles south of Mazera. The ship had been heading from Sokhna, Egypt, to Busheir, Iran. Twenty-three crew members are from Sri Lanka, one is from the Philippines and another is from Syria.","Private security force on cargo ship repels two attacks by pirates near Somalia .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Smoke billowed into the sky over Egypt's capital Wednesday from a fire at the Interior Ministry compound, a blaze witnesses say was set by protesters upset about labor issues. Part of a building, surrounding buildings such as the criminal records building, and several cars had been torched.  Witnesses said the flames could have been ignited by Molotov cocktails. Soldiers and police rushed to scene and a couple of men were detained, the witnesses reported. The compound is three blocks away from Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the sometimes violent clashes that eventually brought down the 30-year regime of President Hosni Mubarak February 11.  Skirmishes also took place near where the fire burned Wednesday. The incident comes as Egyptians continue to work to create the new leadership structure of the country after the revolution. State-run media reported Wednesday that there have been about 1,300 official complaints lodged against former Egyptian ministers and government officials. Interior Minister Mahmoud Wagdi said he ordered that all of the complaints, many of them about government waste and corruption, be investigated, the state-run EgyNews website reported. The investigation comes after Attorney General Abdel Meguid Mahmoud requested that the assets of Mubarak and his family be frozen, according to EgyNews website.  Along with the former president's assets, those belonging to his wife, Suzanne, were also frozen, along with the assets of the former president's eldest son, Alaa, and younger son, Gamal, and both of the sons' wives, according to the report. As CNN correspondent Ivan Watson was filming the aftermath of the fire outside the Interior Ministry Wednesday, an Egyptian military officer with two stars on his epaulets grabbed Watson and demanded he turn over his camera. Watson showed the officer his Egyptian government press accreditation. Saying, ""Be quiet, don't talk!"" the officer dragged Watson away from bystanders and demanded Watson delete video of the incident.  ""If you delete the video, I will let you go free,"" the officer said, identifying himself only as ""Mohammed."" Eventually, another officer intervened, and escorted CNN journalists from the scene. Journalists, especially photographers, routinely have been harassed by Egyptian authorities since protests erupted last month.  Cairo-based photographer Roy Mattieu wrote Wednesday on his Twitter account, ""I've been arrested three times by the army for my camera & lens, afraid to take them out of the bag now, thought it was improving, not."" Egypt has faced a wave of labor unrest since Mubarak was ousted.  Workers at banks, factories, government ministries and at the strategic Suez Canal have gone on strike, demanding better wages and the resignation of executives accused of corruption. Egypt's new military rulers have repeatedly called for an end to the strikes. CNN's Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","Egyptian military officer demands CNN delete footage .

"(CNN) -- The space shuttle program should have come to an end a long time ago, NASA administrator Charles Bolden told CNN in an exclusive interview Wednesday. The 30-year program has been kept on life support because the United States has not readied another vehicle to take its place. ""What is not acceptable is the fact that the most powerful nation in the world, the United States of America, finds itself in a situation that we didn't do the proper planning to have a vehicle in place to replace shuttle when it lands its last landing,"" Bolden said. NASA originally planned to retire the aging shuttle fleet last September, but mission delays have pushed that date. But once Endeavour, Atlantis and Discovery are permanently grounded, Russia's aging Soyuz capsules will ferry astronauts and cosmonauts to the space station and bring what supplies can fit in the smaller craft. And that will have to do, perhaps throughout this decade, until commercial cargo spacecraft are available. The last shuttle landing, according to the administrator, will not be in April when Endeavour is scheduled to fly. NASA says it wants one more mission to resupply the space station. That flight would be STS-135 this summer, using the Atlantis orbiter and designated with the acronym that stands for ""Space Transportation System."" But whether NASA will have the money for the flight -- about a half a billion dollars -- is in question. ""We are budgeted for 135 and unless something disastrous happens, it's our intent to fly it,"" said Bolden, ""It's in the authorization bill signed by the president back in November, so for me it's the law and I'm excited about it because I need it, so we plan to fly 135."" That would leave three flights before the program ends. STS-133 using Discovery sits on the launch pad ready to make its last trip into space Thursday. In April, STS-134 with Endeavour is schedule to fly. Commanding that mission is astronaut Mark Kelly. Kelly's wife, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, was among 19 people shot in Arizona during a political event. Giffords is going through rehabilitation in Houston as she recovers from a gunshot wound to the head. During a news conference, Kelly said his wife would attend his launch. ""I pray that he is absolutely correct,"" Bolden said, ""because for all in the NASA family, who have been praying with him ever since that Saturday, and all of us who love her and him, It would be just tremendous, it would be tremendous for the nation. It would give everybody a big boost."" But with those launches, the nation is seeing an end to its only means of putting humans in space. It is also seeing an end to a program that caught the public's attention nearly 30 years ago, with the launch on April 12, 1981, of the shuttle Columbia on the program's first mission. Bolden hopes that at least two commercial space companies will emerge to transport astronauts to the International Space Station. This will allow NASA to concentrate on building a new heavy-lift rocket capable of leaving lower Earth orbit. There had been concern whether the space agency would have enough money to develop this vehicle. Bolden said the money is there to build a vehicle that will evolve over time. ""When I say we are not going to do things the way we used to, we're not building the world's heaviest, biggest rocket right out of the chute. It's going to take us ... a decade or so to get to the point that we have the final vehicle that is going to take the first humans to Mars,"" said Bolden. The White House has said it wants humans on Mars by the mid-2030s. Right now, Bolden says his priority is flying these last three shuttle missions and bringing the astronauts home safely.","NASA's space shuttle program has three missions left .

"Washington (CNN) -- New information regarding the killing of a U.S. immigration agent in Mexico points to it being a sanctioned hit by the Zetas drug cartel and not a rogue incident, said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who said he has been briefed by federal immigration officials. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Jaime Zapata was killed and another agent injured when they were ambushed on a highway in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi this week. McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, said he has been receiving various reports on the incident and he provided new details on the shooting. Zapata and Special Agent Victor Avila were driving back to Mexico City from a meeting with U.S. officials from Monterrey and stopped for sandwiches at a Subway shop in the city of San Luis Potosi, McCaul told CNN. It is possible that the attackers began tracking them from that point, the congressman said. Once on the highway, two vehicles carrying what are now believed to be members of the Zetas bracketed the agents' SUV, he said. The car in front of them braked, and the agents' vehicle made contact with it and went off the road, he said. According to the reports McCaul has received, the agents put the car in park, which automatically unlocked the doors and which gave the assailants an opportunity to try to open the door. In the struggle to lock the doors, the SUV's window was partially rolled down. Zapata and Avila told the 10-15 gunmen, ""We're Americans, we're diplomats,"" according to McCaul. They responded by opening fire through the opening. Investigators recovered 83 shell casings at the scene, he said. ""The question is whether they were rogue Zetas operating on their own, or if it was a sanctioned Zeta hit,"" McCaul said. New information, McCaul said, pointed to the latter. It was unclear whether any of the information came from debriefings by Avila, who was recovering from his wounds after being discharged from the hospital Wednesday. Earlier, Mexico's ambassador to the United States said his country will do everything it can to apprehend those who shot the two agents. ""Mexican law enforcement authorities and the Mexican government will do anything and everything in their power to find these individuals and swiftly bring them to justice,"" Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan said Wednesday. His pledge came as the United States announced the formation of a joint task force to investigate Tuesday's shootings in Mexico. The announcement came after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano met with Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday to discuss the attack on the two agents. The FBI will lead the task force, composed of Justice and Homeland Security investigators. ""This joint task force reflects our commitment to bring the investigatory and prosecutorial power of the U.S. government to bear as we work with the Mexican government to bring these criminals to justice,"" Napolitano said in a news release. ""The murder of Special Agent Jaime Zapata and the shooting of another ICE agent provide a sad reminder of the dangers American law enforcement officers face every day,"" Holder said in the release. ""Working with our Mexican counterparts, we have already launched an aggressive investigation, and this joint task force will ensure that every available resource is used to bring the perpetrators of this terrible crime to justice."" The agents were returning to Mexico City after meeting other U.S. personnel in San Luis Potosí, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said Wednesday. ""Such meetings among U.S. law enforcement personnel working in Mexico are a regular part of ICE's bilateral cooperation in Mexico under existing agreements,"" it said, adding that the Mexican government does not authorize U.S. law enforcement personnel to carry weapons. One official said the victims were the first Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to be gunned down in Mexico. The agency said about 30 officers are assigned to its office in Mexico City; they work on a range of issues including drugs, weapons, currency and immigration. Mexican officials also condemned the shootings, saying the implications could be grim. ""I think it's a serious escalation of the willingness of these syndicates to push back not only against the Mexican government's efforts to shut them down, but to the very important and very productive cooperation that we've unleashed with the United States."" Sarukhan said. Zapata joined the immigration agency in 2006 and was assigned to a Laredo, Texas, office, where he served on the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Unit and the Border Enforcement Security Task Force, according to the statement from the agency's director, John Morton. Zapata had been assigned to the agency's Attache Office at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Avila served on the agency's Human Smuggling and Trafficking Unit and Financial/Asset Forfeiture Unit based in El Paso, and was on temporary assignment in the country, ICE said. Prior to joining the agency in 2004, Avila was a federal probation officer. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Jeanne Meserve, Paul Vercammen and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report .","NEW: The killing may have been a targeted hit, congressman says .

"Top seed Roger Federer has progressed to the semifinals of the Dubai Tennis Championships with a straight-sets win over Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky. The Swiss world No. 2 won 6-3 6-4 and will on Friday play Richard Gasquet, who beat fellow Frenchman Gilles Simon 5-7 6-2 6-4 in the closing last-eight tie. Federer is seeking his fifth victory in the Emirate, having won the title three years in a row from 2003. ""At the end of the day, you want to give yourself chances to win the trophy, and that's what I'm doing,"" he told the ATP website on Thursday. ""I think I didn't have any completely easy matches here. I've always had to be very focused."" In the other half of the draw, world No. 3 Novak Djokovic remained on course for a third successive title in Dubai after coming from behind to beat Germany's Florian Mayer. The Serbian second seed trailed 38-ranked Mayer 3-5 in the opening set of their quarterfinal, before going on to win 10 out of the next 11 games to wrap up a 7-5 6-1 victory and book a semifinal against Czech third seed Tomas Berdych. Calendar of the court: The six seasons of the tennis year . ""It was a very slow start, I was making lots of unforced errors. But when I needed to play well and needed to keep the ball in the court I did,"" the 23-year-old said. It is the second match in a row that the Australian Open champion has been forced to work hard for a win, after he was pushed to three sets by Spain's Feliciano Lopez in their fourth-round encounter. World No. 7 Berdych defeated Germany's Philipp Petzschner in straight sets, saving six break-points on his way to a 7-5 6-4 win. The 2010 Wimbledon runner-up is yet to drop a set at this week's hard-court tournament. At the WTA hard-court event in Doha, newly-crowned women's No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki continued her good run of form with an impressive 6-2 6-0 quarterfinal win over Italy's Flavia Pennetta in the Qatar Ladies' Open on Thursday. The 20-year-old Dane, who won 12 consecutive games after dropping the first two, will play Marion Bartoli of France for a place in the final. France's former Wimbledon finalist eased past China's Peng Shuai 6-2 6-2. Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva battled into the last four with a 7-5 6-7 (5-7) 7-5 win over Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova. Zvonareva, runner-up in 2008 when the event was last held, will next face Serbian fifth seed Jelena Jankovic -- who won 6-2 6-4 against Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic, a ""lucky loser"" entrant into the main draw. Meanwhile, world No. 11 Mikhail Youzhny -- a semifinalist at last week's ATP Marseille Open -- has announced his retirement from Russia's Davis Cup team. The 28-year-old Youzhny, who was part of the Russian team who beat France to win the men's team competition in 2002, said it was time for the country's younger players to take over. Former world No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko has also made himself unavailable for Russia's World Group tie against Sweden on March 4-6, and the team will instead be led by 76th-ranked Teimuraz Gabashvili.","World No. 2 Roger Federer beats Sergiy Stakhovsky to make Dubai semifinals .

"(Mashable)  -- Napster co-founder and Facebook founding president Sean Parker lashed out at the movie ""The Social Network"" at a conference in Europe Sunday, calling it ""a complete work of fiction."" As you can see in this video (skip to 5:20), Parker admires the production values of the film, but objects to the way his character was portrayed. He particularly dislikes the scene where he writes a check to Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin: . ""The part of the movie that frustrated me is actually the scene at the end where the character played by Justin Timberlake -- who happens to have my name -- basically writes a check to Eduardo -- who I'm also, I consider Eduardo a friend of mine, and I'm one of the few people at Facebook who still interacts with Eduardo -- and throws it in his face and has security escort him out of the building. ""And I mean, that's just rude. This guy in the movie is a morally reprehensible human being."" Parker made the remarks in an on-stage interview at the DLD Conference 2011 in Munich, which started Sunday. In an interview with Mashable three months ago, Zuckerberg wouldn't say whether he liked the film or not, but thought its audience size was minuscule compared with Facebook's: ""We build products that 500 million people see...

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Thousands of people who filled the streets of Cairo on Tuesday hope their demonstrations against corruption and failing economic policies will cause upheaval in the government, like the similar protests in Tunisia that inspired them. But analysts caution that in Egypt, the protesters are up against a different set of challenges. Juan Cole, a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan and blogger, describes Tunisia as ""a little bit unique."" ""There have been lots of civil wars. There's been lots of societies in turmoil. But this kind of phenomenon where you had crowds peacefully coming into the streets to demand a change in their own contract with their government -- in the Arab world proper, this is the first time it's happened and it's the first time since 1979 in the Middle East,"" Cole told CNN last week. He noted that Tunisia is the ""most secular country in the Arab world."" Its traditions have favored women's rights and its Islamist influence is negligible. Tunisia also lacked the oil resources of other Arab states and the ethnic divisions seen in other Middle Eastern countries, which make it harder for opposition movements to unite, he noted. Looking at the protests Tuesday in Cairo, Mamoun Fandy of the International Institute for Strategic Studies told CNN he was not seeing a ""turning point or tipping point yet."" Noting the strength of the army, he said, ""The Egyptian system is too strong and too resilient."" A key question that will show the potential strength of the demonstrations Tuesday is whether hardcore protesters will stay through the night, or whether the rallies will fizzle down, he said. Eric Trager, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Pennsylvania and a former Fulbright fellow in Egypt, wrote in The Atlantic, ""Egypt's liberal activists overwhelmingly come from the wired generation of Twitter and Facebook, and this makes them optimistic that pro-democratic movements can go viral, even in a political environment as traditionally illiberal as the Middle East. ... Yet Egyptian activists face tremendous odds -- in particular, an entrenched dictatorship that is determined to discredit the very idea of domino-effect democratization."" Time.com published a story Thursday from writer Abigail Hauslohner in Cairo headlined, ""After Tunisia: Why Egypt Isn't Ready to Have Its Own Revolution."" Some Egyptians ""believe the time is now"" for protests to bring about change like in Tunisia, and several people in Egypt have set themselves on fire or attempted to in recent days -- much like the self-immolation of a young unemployed man in Tunisia that sparked protests in that country,"" she writes. ""But in Egypt, it doesn't go much deeper than that."" A greater percentage of Egypt's population than Tunisia's lives below the poverty line, she writes. ""The citizens of Egypt regularly complain of a neglectful regime that knows more about torture than it does about public service, and they're furious with a regime that seems to swallow any domestic profits before they can reach the lower classes. And yet no one predicts a revolutionary reset anytime soon."" Two factors distinguish Egypt from Tunisia in this respect, Hauslohner writes: Tunisia's government spent generously on education, creating a frustrated educated but unemployed population. And in Egypt, ""the military stands with"" Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Time.com is a partner of CNN.com. Writing in Newsweek, journalist Mike Giglio suggested the ""upcoming protest in Cairo could mark the beginning of another upheaval."" ""Tuesday will be the first real test of whether the revolution is contagious,"" he wrote in a story published Monday. Many protesters believe their demonstrations will prove to have far more power than naysayers suggest. A Facebook page that has served to help organize Tuesday's protests in Cairo says, ""Many young Egyptians are now fed up with the inhuman treatment they face on a daily basis in streets, police stations and everywhere. ... Egyptians are aspiring to the day when Egypt has its freedom and dignity back, the day when the current 30 years long emergency martial law ends and when Egyptians can freely elect their true representatives.""","Analysts: Egypt is a different story from Tunisia .

"Washington (CNN) -- State Department analysts raised questions about the psychological state and health of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, according to a December 2009 cable recently published by WikiLeaks. The analysts were curious about the ""interpersonal dynamics"" of the president and her husband Nestor Kirchner, who was also his wife's immediate predecessor as president. The cable, which was sent from the secretary of state's office and signed by Hillary Clinton, said that the analysts had ""a much more solid understanding of Nestor Kirchner's style and personality than we do of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner,"" and wanted to develop ""a more well-rounded view"" of the then-president's personality. Among the questions put to the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires was a series about President Fernandez de Kirchner's mental state and health: how she managed her nerves and anxiety, how stress affected her behavior toward advisers and decision-making, whether she was on medications, and how she calmed down when distressed. The cable also asked about President Fernandez de Kirchner's approach to dealing with problems, and whether she shared her husband's ""adversarial view of politics."" It also asked about how the Argentine first couple divided up their day and on what issues each of them took the lead or deferred to the other. The 2009 cable also asked about the health of former President Kirchner. He died of an apparent heart attack in October. President Fernandez de Kirchner was elected to office in October of 2007, at the same time then-Sen. and former first lady Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2008 presidential election in the United States.","WikiLeaks published a 2009 State Department cable about Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner .

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund moved a big step closer to a first German Bundesliga title in nine years on Saturday with a historic 3-1 victory over defending champions Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena. Jurgen Klopp's team moved 13 points clear of second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, who visit Werder Bremen on Sunday, and 16 ahead of Bayern -- who lost at home to Dortmund for the first time in 20 years. Louis van Gaal's team dropped to fourth after the home defeat, occupying Germany's final Champions League position for next season with 10 rounds to play. Paraguay striker Lucas Barrios opened the scoring in the ninth minute with his 11th goal of the season after Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger lost posesssion to Kevin Grosskreutz, who threaded a perfect pass into the penalty area. Welcome win for struggling Wolfsburg . Brazilian defender Luis Gustavo equalized seven minutes later with his first goal for Bayern since arriving from Hoffenheim in January, sidefooting in a volley from Franck Ribery's corner. Dortmund immediately went back in front through a wonderful effort from Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin, who curled a 20-yard left-foot shot past goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. Bundesliga top scorer Mario Gomez thought he had leveled again in the 20th minute, but the striker was ruled to be offside. Former Bayern defender Mats Hummels sealed the Westphalian team's victory with a header from Mario Gotze's corner on the hour mark. With 15 minutes left, Dortmund's 22-year-old Australian keeper Mitchell Langerak capped a solid Bundesliga debut when he denied Germany international Gomez from close range. Hanover claimed third place after central defender Christian Schulz's last-gasp header was enough to see off St. Pauli. The 27-year-old converted from Portuguese winger Sergio Pinto's 87th-minute corner to put Mirko Slomka's team two points ahead of Bayern,. Mainz remained in fifth place after also needing a late goal to snatch all three points away to Hoffenheim. Former Austria midfielder Andreas Ivanschitz put the visitors in front before his compatriot David Alaba looked to have rescued a draw for ninth-placed Hoffenheim in the 84th minute. But with just four minutes left, 30-year-old Colombian midfielder Elkin Soto secured victory for Thomas Tuchel's Mainz with his second league goal of the season. Germany international Lukas Podolski scored an 88th-minute winner to help Cologne beat SC Freiburg and climb into 11th position, eight points behind their opponents. Sixth-placed Hamburg could only manage a 1-1 draw away to relegation-threatened Kaiserslautern. Marco Kurz's Kaiserslautern drew first blood through Adam Hlousek's first-half goal, but Marcell Jansen's leveler for Armin Veh's Hamburg left the home team in 15th position and above the relegation play-off place on goal difference. Schalke's disappointing Bundesliga season continued with a 1-1 draw at home to Nuremberg. Nuremberg, currently eighth in the table, took the lead through Jens Hegeler, only for former Real Madrid and Spain striker Raul to equalize after 52 minutes.","Borussia Dortmund record first win away to Bayern Munich since 1991 .

"(Oprah.com) -- If you make time each month to give your money some attention, you'll start 2012 in fabulous financial shape. Thoughtful financial planning can easily take a backseat to daily life. (Do your taxes two months early? You're just trying to stay on top of today.) But I promise that if you set aside time each month to give your money some attention, when 2012 rolls around you'll be in fabulous financial shape. Here's my plan of attack for the year to come: . Automate Your Security . No one's ever achieved financial fitness with a resolution that's abandoned by February. Building security requires a commitment to saving, and the easiest way to save is with an automatic transfer. Search online for the highest-yielding bank or credit union savings account; after you've opened one, set up monthly deposits from your checking account. If your employer matches employee contributions to a 401(k), sign up now. Already enrolled? Make sure you're contributing enough to qualify for the maximum company match, and if you're not, boost your contribution rate by one percentage point each year until you're eligible for the maximum match. Then make funding your individual retirement account (IRA) automatic as well by linking it to your checking account. Timely Tip: If you or your child will be attending college this fall, submit your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form ASAP, using estimates of your 2010 taxes. February: Get ahead of the game . You should have received all documents necessary -- your W-2, 1098 (if you have a mortgage), and 1099s -- to complete your 2010 taxes. You've still got two months, but handling this task early has major benefits. If you're surprised by a tax bill, you have time to figure out a payment strategy. If you're entitled to a refund, you will receive it that much sooner. March: Do some spring cleaning . Make time to toss any outdated paperwork. You should keep a copy of your tax return indefinitely, but you need to save supporting documents for only three years. Anything from before 2007 should get shredded. If you're self-employed or have income from multiple sources, hold on to your documents for six years. That's how long the IRS has to challenge your reported income. Next, roll over 401(k)s from old jobs and IRAs at different firms into one account at a low-cost brokerage or mutual fund company -- it's easier to keep track of this way, and you'll save on maintenance fees. Oprah.com: What money can teach you about personal power . April: Take stock . As we head into the sign of Taurus, take a moment to think about bull markets. For long-term savings goals, stocks have the potential to generate inflation-beating gains. But we're all a bit queasy about stocks these days. Focus your stock investments on those that pay dividends -- payments a company makes to its shareholders. Sticking with a low-cost exchange traded fund (ETF) with a diversified portfolio of dividend payers is a smart strategy. Try the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) or the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY). Timely Tip: If you do file your taxes in April, let your return guide your next move. If you're owed a refund, change your W-4 withholding to get that money back in your paychecks where it belongs. If you owe a penalty, make sure you're not having too little money withheld. May: Hit a home run . This is the start of house-buying season, but since most of us stay put in any given year, let's focus on you current mortgage holders -- starting with your homeowner's insurance. If rebuilding costs in your area have fallen in recent years, you could be overinsured. Confirm that you have an extended replacement policy, which pays a set percentage over the dollar value of your coverage. And switch to a higher deductible (at least $1,000 or so), which will lower your premium. Cover any expenses that amount to less than $1,000 with your emergency savings fund. Finally, check your property tax base. If your current property tax bill is based on an old valuation of your home, contact your local tax assessor -- you may be paying too much. June: Gift smart . With all the graduations and weddings coming your way, you're probably planning to purchase some presents. Here's my gift-giving rule: Respect your current financial situation. The last thing family and friends want is for you to spend money on them that you don't have or that you can't really spare. Oprah.com: Give your finances a reality check . July: Have the talk . For those of you with camp-age kids, July no doubt involves a Parents' Day full of festivities. I'm proposing a different spin on Parents' Day: Take time to talk to your parents about their financial well-being. First, confirm that they have the key estate documents: a will, a revocable living trust, and durable power of attorney for both healthcare and financial matters. Have they reviewed their beneficiaries recently? If not, they should do so now. Next, look into long-term care insurance. Finally, help them formulate an advance directive -- a document that spells out the medical care an individual wants in the event he or she becomes physically unable to communicate. It may be a difficult conversation to have, but it lets your parents know that if the time comes, you'll make sure their exact wishes are followed. That's a great way to honor what they mean to you. August: Teach your children a lesson . This school year, think about instituting new money rules for you and your kids. I'm a big advocate of a work-for-pay setup rather than an allowance that isn't attached to chores -- it's a great way to impart the value of money to your children. Timely Tip: If you need a new car, August is the time to shop -- dealers are eager to make room for next year's models. September: Check, please! Have you checked your credit report in the past year? Didn't think so. Visit AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access your reports on file at the big-three credit bureaus -- for free. If you anticipate taking out a loan in the next six months or may be job hunting, or if your credit report turns up any mistakes, you should also obtain your FICO credit score ($16; MyFICO.com.) Oprah.com: Are you overpaying on your taxes? October: Brace for life's tricks . I wish you only treats this Halloween. But while we all hope for the best, we still need to prepare for the worst. Parents of young children must have life insurance and a will in place -- it's non-negotiable. For most families, term life insurance is the easiest and least expensive solution. Go to SelectQuote.com or AccuQuote.com to make sure you're looking out for your family's best interests if the worst should happen. Timely Tip: Parents of new college grads: The six-month grace period between graduation and repayment for many student loans is approaching. Make sure repayment arrangements are nailed down. November: Bag the best benefits . Fall is typically open-enrollment period at work, when you can make changes to your benefits package for the coming year. If you learn that your health insurance rates will increase in 2012, check whether your company offers a high-deductible plan that's paired with a health savings account. If you're in good health, this can be a great way to reduce your premium costs by agreeing to pay a higher deductible (minimum of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for families). You can then invest in an HSA, which allows your tax-deductible contributions to be used for medical expenses, including the deductible. Your unused HSA balance can be rolled over and used in subsequent years. December: Pay in cash . Financially speaking, December can be rough: Gift giving, holiday parties, and vacations all take their toll. My advice? Stash your credit cards and live within your means all 31 days of this month.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt on Tuesday, an unprecedented display of anti-government rage inspired in part by the tumult in the nearby North African nation of Tunisia. Three people died in the clashes between protesters and police, according to Egypt's official MENA news agency. Two demonstrators died in the eastern city of Suez, and one policeman was killed in Cairo, it said. MENA reported that at least 49 people have been injured. Earlier, Egypt's Interior Ministry said that 36 police officers had been hurt during the protests. Throngs in the sprawling capital city marched from the huge Tahrir Square toward the parliament building, according to CNN reporters on the scene. Demonstrators threw rocks at police, and police hurled rocks back. Tear-gas canisters were shot at demonstrators, and the protesters threw them back. Protest organizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by Tunisians, who 10 days ago forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's 23-year rule. The grievances were foreshadowed by several Egyptians who set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire this month, mirroring the self-immolation of a Tunisian man whose action spurred the uprising there. The Tunisian uprising was the most successful revolt in the region since 1979, but it is anybody's guess whether uprisings will spread to other Arabic-speaking lands. Juan Cole, a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan, says Tunisia is different from other Arab nations. Tunisia, he said, is the ""most secular country in the Arab world."" Its traditions have favored women's rights, and its Islamist influence is negligible. The United States and other governments are monitoring the demonstrations in Cairo and elsewhere closely. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged all people to ""exercise restraint"" and supported ""the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people."" ""But our assessment is that the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people,"" she said. To highlight the role of police corruption, the protest organizers in Egypt picked January 25 -- Police Day and a national holiday -- to hold protests. The protests started off small, but they grew as people came to the center of the city from bridges over the Nile River. Police were restrained and at times were seemingly outnumbered by the protesters, who sang the national anthem and inched forward to express their ire toward the government. Witnesses said large groups of plainclothes police were heading to Tahrir Square. Protesters had been expressing their anger over the rising cost of living, failed economic policies and corruption, but all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand: the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak, in power for three decades. The outpouring included young and old, Christians and Muslims, students, workers and businesspeople. ""We breathe corruption in the air,"" said one demonstrator, who along with others said their children have no future. At its peak there were perhaps 15,000 to 20,000 people in Tahrir Square, but that crowd later dwindled to about 5,000 to 8,000. The main road in front of parliament, Qasr Al-Aini, was closed to traffic. The square is two blocks from parliament. ""Egyptians have the right to express themselves,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said of the protests. The Interior Ministry called on demonstrators to follow the law and avoid threatening the safety of bystanders, the public and private property. Social media have been all-important in mobilizing and organizing protests. But bloggers and others in Egypt reported problems with electronic communication later in the day. Activists can't access their cell phones or text messages, and opposition websites can't be accessed. Twitter was blocked in Egypt about 11 a.m. ET, the company said. There were other demonstrations in Cairo suburbs of Heliopolis, Shubra Al-Khaima, Muhandasin and Dar Al-Salam. One man said Egypt is not Tunisia, it's Romania under Nicolae Ceausescu, a reference to the late and much-reviled communist leader. The Front to Defend Egypt Protesters, an alliance of lawyers who helped organize the events, said that about 200 demonstrators were in the southern city of Aswan, 2,000 in the eastern city of Ismailiya and about 3,000 in the northern city of Mahallah. The Egyptian government did not issue permits for Tuesday's planned protests. In an interview released Tuesday with state-run al-Ahram newspaper, Interior Minister Habib Adly warned that ""the security agencies are able to stop any attempt to attend"" the demonstrations and called the efforts of the ""youth staging street protests ineffective."" By early Tuesday morning, more than 90,000 people throughout the country had pledged to participate in the Facebook event ""We Are All Khaled Said,"" named after an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police. The Facebook group demands raising the minimum wage, firing the interior minister, creating two-term presidential term limits and scrapping existing emergency laws that the group says ""resulted in police control"" over the people and the nation. Amnesty International released a statement Monday ""urging the Egyptian authorities not to crack down"" on the planned nationwide demonstration. The banned Muslim Brotherhood, the biggest organized opposition to Mubarak's regime, had stated it would not have an official presence at Tuesday's protests, but some of its members ""have reportedly been summoned and threatened with arrest and detention"" if they attend and protest, Amnesty International said. Opposition leader and Nobel Peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei posted statements supporting the protests on his Twitter account. He also created a video statement addressing policemen that was released Monday on YouTube. ""I sympathize with you because sometimes you are asked to do things that you do not want to do,"" ElBaradei said. ""One day, I hope that you will regain your role as the protectors of the people; rather than protectors of ... fraud elections. I am sure that every one of you deep inside is looking forward to the day that his role will again be with the people and a part of them, rather than against them,"" he said. Public sentiment against state security forces has grown recently with alleged videos of police brutality shown on the internet. A recent report from Human Rights Watch said the problem is ""epidemic,"" and ""in most cases, officials torture detainees to obtain information and coerce confessions, occasionally leading to death in custody."" Some other human rights groups, such as the Arabic Network for Human Rights, have drawn a comparison between Egypt and Tunisia under Ben Ali, in terms of the level of government corruption and police brutality. Adly, the Egyptian interior minister, dismissed any such comparisons, calling it ""propaganda"" that had been rejected by politicians as ""intellectual immaturity."" But one woman, identified only as Nahla, who planned to attend the Tuesday protests, disagreed. She wrote in an online post, ""I hope the (Tunisia-style) revolution will be taught in history. And that Egyptians will learn in school later about the January 25th revolution.""","NEW: Egypt's official news agency reports 49 people were injured .

"Gore, Georgia (CNN) -- Duncan Shropshire stops at the edge of the treeline, where the meadow becomes a forest. His yellow linen shirt is misbuttoned and crooked, leaving the bottom of his belly slightly exposed. His 8-year-old daughter, Mia-Grace, stands a foot or so behind him, wiping her runny nose with the sleeve of her blue sweatshirt. After about a minute, she lets out a sigh of boredom. Shropshire, 51, clasps his daughter's hand and begins leading her into the Northwest Georgia forest. ""This is where your ancestors are buried, back here,"" Shropshire says. ""C'mon, I'll show you."" And with a loving tug, Duncan Shropshire shares with his daughter a key piece of their family's history. Still holding hands, the pair weaves through the maze of thin pines, stepping over fallen oaks and basketball-sized sinkholes. Mia-Grace stays silent while her father seems singularly focused on moving forward. After five minutes, they reach a large clearing where rows of fist-sized rocks bulge out of the ground. Each rock sits atop small depressions in the ground. ""You see those humps in the ground?"" Shropshire asks. ""Uh-huh,"" Mia-Grace replies. ""Those are rows of graves. They're stacked like spoons here,"" Shropshire says. ""There was a lot of people here. People of the 1800s are buried here. And I'm trying to keep it in your memory the way granddaddy kept it in mine so it won't be forgotten."" The two crouch over a large, flat rock with the words ""Lewis Dickson, 4"" scratched into it. To the left of the marker is a row of 12 rocks. To the front, there are four other rows of stones, varying in number. ""How long did they bury our kin here?"" Mia-Grace asks. ""They started in the early 1800s, baby,"" Shropshire answers. ""They worked our people to death here. They were slaves. And probably about 1905 is when they stopped burying in this area. Your great-great-great grandfather, a (slave-owning) man named Wesley, he had five children by this slave woman, your great-great-great grandmother. She is buried over here on this side. Her name is Molly."" Mia-Grace's light green eyes get big. ""I'm worried I might step on them,"" she says. ""Oh, baby,"" Shropshire says with a laugh, ""they're gone. They're gone! They're sleeping right now, waiting for the Lord to come."" A ""rare"" and ""special"" place . The Shropshire gravesite is in the Appalachian foothills outside Gore, Georgia. About 1,000 feet from the clearing is an old, abandoned church on a dusty dirt road. Experts say that if slaves or former slaves are buried at the site, it would be a unique archeological find. ""In Appalachia, it would be extremely rare to have a black or slave graveyard,"" explained Ruth Little, co-author of ""Sticks and Stones: Three Centuries of North Carolina Gravemarkers."" ""The farms in Appalachia were small, and there were fewer slaves."" Little says slave cemeteries in the area would have been marked with field stones, like the rocks at the site, or wooden stakes that burned down. ""It's very regional and very local,"" Little continued. ""I've seen on the coastal area with graves marked with seashells."" Other grave markers used in black burial cites throughout the Southeast include iron pipes, broken dishes, cups, bottles and live cedar trees, according to Chicora Foundation Executive Director Michael Trinkley. He specializes in cemetery preservation. ""The problem with preserving these types of sites is that African-American cemeteries are hard to find,"" Trinkley said. ""You can think of the people buried there as the invisible dead. And not knowing where they are, or how many there are, makes them susceptible to loss."" Even if gravesites are recognized, they still might be destroyed for development. Trinkley points to the low country of South Carolina. ""The areas that were used for burial grounds,"" Trinkley explained, ""those areas were close to water. They were considered waste areas, places where burying slaves wasn't a significant loss to the planter. Those areas today are among the most sought-after for real estate."" Officials in Chattooga County, where the site is located, say that they are unaware of any grave sites in the hills near Gore and that the site needs to be registered with the library as a cemetery before it can be considered for protection through local ordinances. Trinkley and Little both say the potential historical importance of grave sites warrant investigation by local or state officials. ""What if in that grave was your mother or your child?"" Trinkley asked. ""It's an issue of respect and an issue of dignity. It's the last decision society and the individual make together."" ""There aren't many traceable slave graveyards, and each one is special in it's own way,"" Little added. She says the Shropshire family can point to that spot and say, ""This is where we're from; this is where our roots are."" Two cemeteries for two ancestors . Shortly before sunset, Mia-Grace and Duncan Shropshire head over to an old white cemetery about a mile from the forest gravesite. The dates on the gravestones suggest that it was used around the same time as the forest cemetery. There, Shropshire and Mia-Grace walk over to a marble headstone that tops 10 feet. In front of it is a small plastic Confederate flag flapping in the breeze. ""This is Wesley Weatherspoon Shropshire. ... He was one of the colonels in the Civil War for the Confederacy,"" Shropshire says. ""He had five children by way of a slave he owned by the name of Molly."" ""My great-great grandmother?"" Mia-Grace asks. ""Your great-great-great grandmother,"" Shropshire corrects her. He turns to point toward another grave site when Mia-Grace notices her father's misbuttoned shirt. She stops him mid-sentence and begins to fix the crooked buttons. ""Why is Molly buried over there and Wesley over here?"" she asks. ""Because that's the way it was, Mia,"" Shropshire answers. Mia-Grace's face is filled with intense concentration as she tries to undo the bottom button on her father's shirt. Finally, she pries the button free. She looks up at her father and says assuredly, ""But people are people. It doesn't matter what they are. They're all the same."" ""That's a good thing to think, but back then it wasn't like that, Mia,"" Shropshire tells her. ""The dark-skinned people were buried way back over yonder, and the light-skinned people were buried here."" Mia-Grace finally fixes her father's shirt, leaving it straight. Then, she skips over to the other end of the cemetery. Shropshire watches her race across the lot. ""You can't do well in life if you don't know your history. Without your history, you're nothing,"" he says. Mia-Grace playfully hides behind a large headstone, calling for her daddy to chase her. A quarter-way toward her, he stops, turns around and yells back, ""I reckon she'll be buried wherever she wants to.""","Duncan Shropshire takes daughter Mia-Grave to see where ancestors are buried .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to send 2,000 additional troops to Ivory Coast, bringing the total mission there to more than 11,000 troops and police. The vote originally had been scheduled for Tuesday, but Security Council diplomats said it was delayed because Russia had objections to the ""political"" language in the draft resolution. U.N. officials requested up to 2,000 more peacekeepers in early January. The political standoff in the country has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002. More than 25,000 Ivorians have fled to neighboring Liberia since the current crisis began, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported last week. Meanwhile, the African Union on Wednesday blamed Ivory Coast's self-declared president, Laurent Gbagbo, for the failure of talks so far to resolve the crisis in the cocoa-producing West African nation. ""There had been progress in the talks, but Gbagbo went back on his earlier agreement to remove the blockade leading to and from the Golf Hotel where (President-elect) Alassane Ouattara is staying,"" said a spokesman for Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the AU mediator. ""Gbagbo has to step down to make way for Ouattara, who legitimately won the election,"" said Odinga's representative, Salim Lone, speaking for the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States. ""The request to remove the blockade was because the AU argued that it's difficult to have discussions with a prisoner,"" Lone said. Ouattara is holed up in the hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. The United Nations has blamed Gbagbo's supporters for a string of attacks on U.N. vehicles and troops in the past week. An independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner of the country's presidential election in November, but Gbagbo, the incumbent, has refused to step aside. Odinga is now leaving Ivory Coast for Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali. He'll meet the heads of state of each country to discuss the Ivory Coast crisis, Lone said, denying that Odinga had ""given up on ... finding a solution to the crisis. ""He's still committed to the African Union and ECOWAS will to first and foremost find a peaceable solution to the crisis. Use of force will be a last resort,"" Lone said. The Economic Community of West African States has threatened to use ""legitimate force"" to remove Gbagbo, who met Monday with African Union mediator Odinga. Gbagbo's foreign minister, Alcide Djedje, said earlier this month that the peacekeepers are ""complicit with the rebellion"" and that the sitting government has ""no more confidence in the U.N."" The West African nation was wracked by civil war from 2002 to 2007, when a settlement left the country divided between north and south. The 2010 elections came with high expectations that they would open a new chapter in the country's history.

"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- A brazen daylight shooting in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on Monday afternoon left four people dead and injured two others, including a 5-year-old boy, a Juarez municipal police spokesman told CNN. Among the dead was a 10-year-old who was nearly decapitated by projectiles from the high-caliber weapon used in the attack, spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. The 5-year-old and the other injured person, 16, were taken to a local hospital where they were being treated for their injuries, police said. Witnesses said an armed man approached their vehicle while it was stopped and opened fire, according to journalist Arturo Chacon. There was no motive for the attack, Sanchez said. Images from the scene showed a white sedan the victims were driving in when they were attacked. The car's side windows were broken and large bullet holes peppered the body of the car. On Sunday, five men were shot and killed at a bar in Juarez, and three others were injured. There are no suspects in either incident. The police offered no other details when asked about the shooting. ""There are no reasons why some days the violence is high and some days the deaths are low in number. This is an ongoing war. It is impossible to try and justify why these things happen here,"" Sanchez said. Journalist Arturo Chacon contributed to this report .","Armed man shoots into stopped car, witnesses say .

"(CNN) -- Severe weather descended on the Southeast Monday, killing at least one person, reducing homes to rubble and leaving drivers stranded in flooded streets as the storm system moved northward up the East Coast. One man was killed in Tennessee after being pinned by a trailer that was lifted by strong winds, said Sgt. Chris Guess, a spokesman for the Franklin County Sheriff's Office. A woman in the home was taken to a hospital with back and leg injuries, he said. The winds also downed trees and caused significant damage in the northern part of the county, northwest of Chattanooga, Guess said, adding that the sheriff's office could not yet confirm whether the destruction was due to a tornado. In neighboring Hamilton County, as many as five buildings and several cars sustained damage from high winds, said Bill Tittle, the county's emergency management chief. About 37,000 homes and businesses were without power in the Chattanooga area as of 3 p.m., Lacie Newton of Electric Power Board told CNN affiliate WTVC. Also Monday, two tornadoes touched down in Kentucky, officials said. In Henry County, the twister leveled two homes, leaving nothing behind but foundation and concrete, according to Michael Webb, public information officer for the state police in Campbellsburg, Kentucky. Three people were asleep in one home when it started ""breaking apart,"" Webb said. The residents tried to escape the twister's fury by running from their home to their car, but the car was blown several feet from its parked position and overturned before it slammed into a tree with all three people inside, Webb said. First responders found everyone doing OK when they arrived on the scene, Webb said. Two people in the second home destroyed by the tornado sustained minor injuries from the storm and were treated at a local hospital, he said. Forecasters are warning other states to be on the lookout for damaging winds. Tornado watches remain in effect from Mississippi northeastward through northern Alabama, eastern Tennessee, southwestern and central Virginia and central and eastern Maryland through Monday evening, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. High winds to the east didn't produce any tornadoes, but were strong enough to knock down power lines and damage road signs in St. Louis. The winds that ripped through the state were accompanied by heavy rains that left motorists stuck in their cars on flooded streets in Kansas City, Missouri. To the north, in Ohio, Illinois and Indiana, the scene was similar. Widespread flooding was expected in Indiana and Ohio Monday afternoon, Morris said. Much of the area has seen 2 to 5 inches of rain in the past week, he said. The rising water flooded streets and businesses in and around Cleveland, where a flash-flood warning was issued Monday morning after an operator at Gates Mill Dam on the Chagrin River in Cuyahoga and Lake counties reported that the dam burst. Officials said the river, which was already experiencing major flooding, could rise even more. The raging water from the dam flowed downstream into portions of Willoughby Hills, Willoughby and Eastlake. The rushing water submerged streets and flooded homes. Residents stranded by the high water were being rescued from their homes Monday evening, video from CNN affiliate WBNS showed. Larry Greene, with the Lake County Emergency Management Agency, told CNN affiliate WOIO that property and structure damage estimates won't be available until the water starts to recede, but no injuries were reported from the dam failure. A slight risk of severe thunderstorms continues for portions of middle and eastern Tennessee, northern Alabama, Georgia and as far as western North Carolina. Tornado warnings were issued Monday afternoon and into the evening for the Atlanta metro area as heavy rains and wind moved into the region, according to the National Weather Service. Downed trees were reported in Acworth, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta. Those thunderstorms could also affect the lower Mississippi Valley east and northeastward to the mid-Atlantic and southeastern Atlantic coasts. Forecasters say a cold front was surging eastward across the area, triggering severe storms and bringing additional rain to Tennessee and Kentucky where flood watches remain in effect through Thursday evening. CNN's Dave Alsup and Tristan Smith contributed to this report .","At least one death has been reported from the storm system .

"(CNN) -- He told them it was a good day to die so they could be born again. ""You're not going to die,"" self-help author and speaker James Arthur Ray told participants in the sweat lodge that day, they later recalled. ""You may think you are, but you're not going to die ... You need to surrender to death to survive it."" The sweat lodge ceremony, the culmination of a five-day retreat in Sedona, Arizona, was meant to be a ""rebirthing."" But by the end of that day, October 8, 2009, two people had died. A third died nine days later, and -- authorities allege -- at least 15 others fell ill. Ray, 53, is charged with three counts of reckless manslaughter in the deaths and could face up to 10 years in prison on each if convicted. Opening statements are set to begin in his trial Tuesday. Prosecutors claim Ray was reckless in the way he conducted the sweat lodge ceremony at the Angel Valley Retreat Center, and heated the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heat stroke. Ray's defense attorneys maintain the deaths were a tragic accident and said he took precautions to forestall harm to the sweat lodge participants, including positioning a nurse and several employees and volunteers trained in CPR outside the sweat lodge and making water, oranges, watermelon and fluids available to participants. ""We do not seek to minimize the tragedy of the sweat lodge deaths,"" said a December 2009 letter to prosecutors from defense attorney Luis Li. ""But these deaths were not the result of criminal conduct. Mr. Ray and his team relied on Angel Valley to provide a safe environment, warned people of the risks, did not force people to participate, did not prevent them from leaving, and did everything they could to prepare for any problems and to assist when problems arose."" In addition, Ray encouraged participants to hydrate throughout the retreat and warned them the sweat lodge would be very hot, Li wrote. Participants signed a release form saying that the retreat activities could include a sweat lodge with enclosed spaces and high temperatures, according to the letter. At least 16 people came out of the sweat lodge at various points before the ceremony's conclusion, Li said, and about five of them went back in. Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, died on October 8. Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, died on October 17. The sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds, with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes. While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds. In interviews with authorities, some participants recounted feeling distress in the first few rounds. Later, they told police, people began to pass out, others began to vomit and still others went into shock. Some were encouraged to lie down in the dirt to seek relief from the heat. ""(Ray) knew that people were in trouble,"" Tom McFeeley, Brown's cousin, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Monday. ""Those calls for help were ignored."" The scene inside the lodge became chaotic and nightmarish, participants recounted. Those who had lost consciousness were dragged out between rounds, participants said. One man stumbled into the middle of the lodge and into the hot rocks, burning his hand. Brown reportedly was one of those who encouraged others to stick it out in the sweat lodge. Shore helped a woman out of the sweat lodge between the sixth and seventh rounds before returning to complete the ceremony, witnesses said. Neuman apparently was asked by those around her if she wanted to leave the ceremony, but said no. She never regained consciousness after its conclusion. Neuman died from ""multisystem organ failure due to hyperthermia due to prolonged sweat lodge exposure,"" her autopsy report said. Brown and Shore both died from heat stroke, a medical examiner concluded. All three deaths were ruled accidental. However, a Yapavai County grand jury indicted Ray one day after the medical examiners issued their reports. Participant Sandy Andretti said she had to be carried out. ""She said she was dizzy and couldn't function after they hosed her down, and then she went into shock and started shaking,"" said a police incident report. ""... Sandy told me when she came out, she didn't care about herself because she was seeing other people in distress and throwing up, and she felt she needed to help them."" Ray had conducted the Spiritual Warrior Retreat for six years at a cost of about $10,000 to participants. The sweat lodge, 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide, was built to accommodate up to about 75 people. There was a pit in the center where heated rocks were placed. Ray poured water over them to create steam. Prosecutors maintain that Ray psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they weren't feeling well, contributing to their deaths. ""You can't walk out when you're in an altered state. You can't walk out when your capacity to make decisions is taken away from you,"" said McFeeley, Brown's cousin. ""Everything conducted that week was to make sure people fell in line ... Their ability to make rational decisions was taken away from them."" Defense attorneys dispute that. Liu wrote in the 2009 letter that Ray ""did not lead or pressure participants into making a choice they otherwise would not have made. This was a five-day retreat, not a cult.

"(CNN) -- Pirates boarded an American yacht off the coast of Oman three days after the boat's owners split off from the relative safety of a sailing group traversing a dangerous section of the Indian Ocean, according to the group, the Blue Water Rally. The yacht, the S/V Quest, was overtaken by pirates on Friday, according to U.S. officials. Owners Jean and Scott Adam and two other people on board, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle, had been traveling with yachts participating in the Blue Water Rally since their departure from Phuket, Thailand, the rally group said Sunday in a statement on its website. But they broke off on February 15 after leaving Mumbai, India, to take a different route, the group said. ""We feel desperately sorry for our four friends onboard and our thoughts are with them and their friends and family,"" the London-based group said in a posting on its website. ""All the yachts still on the rally are fine and well."" U.S. officials have not identified the people on board the ship, but have confirmed that four U.S. citizens are involved. U.S. officials have made no further comment on the situation since Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette, deputy commander of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, said Saturday that the government is evaluating its options. Another U.S. official, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation, said previously that the United States is determining what military assets are in the region and the capabilities of the personnel onboard. The official said that the pirates are believed to be onboard the yacht with the Americans, and the next step would be to determine whether the military could keep the yacht from reaching the shore -- either by blocking or harassing it. The Adams are experienced boaters, having started a world tour in 2004, and were very much conscious of the threat from pirates, said a friend of the Adams, fellow boater Scott Stolnitz.. Scott Adam said several weeks ago that he was concerned about pirate activity in the area, which he had never visited before, Stolnitz said. But he said Adam was determined to traverse the world himself as opposed to shipping the boat -- as some other yacht owners have done. Stolnitz also said the Adams had also been traveling with others on a ""buddy boat,"" but those people decided not to continue. On their website, the Adams say their mission ""is to allow the power of the Word to transform lives ... (and) seek fertile ground for the word and homes for our Bibles."" But Stolnitz said vigorous evangelism wasn't a major emphasis for the couple. ""They use the Bible as an ice breaker,"" he said. The couple posted to their website earlier this year about their travel plans, including a refueling stop in Djibouti, another pirate flash-point. ""Djibouti is a big refueling stop,"" said the post, which is not dated. ""I have no idea what will happen in these ports, but perhaps we'll do some local touring."" They also sent out an e-mail several days ago expressing some unease, Stolnitz said. Piracy has flourished off the coast of Somalia, which has not had an effective government for two decades. In April 2009, pirates seized the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama, leading to a standoff in the Indian Ocean. U.S. forces moved to rescue American Capt. Richard Phillips after seeing a pirate aiming a weapon on his back, officials said at the time. Three pirates were killed and one was arrested. The Somali man arrested was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr and CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","The owners of a yacht taken by pirates on February 18 had been traveling with other boats .

"(CNN) -- Heavy fighting between Islamist militants and government forces in Somalia's capital has left 18 people dead and dozens wounded, medical officials said Sunday. ""The fighting is huge and is marked by heavy exchange of artillery,"" said Ali Musa, a head of a Mogadishu ambulance service. Of the 36 reported wounded, 11 were hurt when an artillery shell hit their bus near Mogadishu's Bakara Market. The African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia said the fighting centered around attempts to destroy a network of tunnels and trenches that the jihadist movement Al-Shabaab used to move weapons and fighters around the capital. The dead included two peacekeepers and six rebel leaders that the Ugandan-led mission said were linked to al Qaeda. ""The discovery and closure of this tunnel is a major step forward in the stabilization effort in the city,"" the Ugandan-led AMISOM mission said in a statement issued Sunday. AMISOM said the fighting erupted Saturday as Al-Shabaab tried to retake the tunnel network. Somalia's state-run radio network said 28 rebels were killed in Saturday's clashes. AMISOM's communique said foreign fighters have effectively taken over Al-Shabaab. It said five of the six rebel leaders killed in the recent fighting came from countries beyond Somalia -- Yemen, Pakistan, India, Kenya and Syria -- while the nationality of the sixth was unknown. AMISOM, which supports Somalia's transitional government, said the combined forces now control about 60 percent of the city. But the government has little influence beyond Mogadishu, and Al-Shabaab controls much of southern Somalia. The horn of Africa nation has not had an effective government since Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown two decades ago. Journalist Mohammed Amiin Adow contributed to this report for CNN.","NEW: AMISOM says 5 of 6 slain rebels were non-Somalis .

"(CNN) -- Opening statements are set to begin Tuesday in the trial of self-help author and speaker James Arthur Ray, who is charged with three counts of reckless manslaughter in the death of three people at an Arizona sweat lodge. The trial stems from a well-publicized incident that took place during a ceremony at a five-day retreat in Sedona, Arizona, on October 8, 2009. Two people died during the ceremony at Angel Valley Retreat Center. A third died nine days later, and -- authorities allege -- at least 15 others fell ill. Ray could face up to 10 years in prison on each count if convicted. HIs attorney has argued that the author is not to blame for the deaths. ""We do not seek to minimize the tragedy of the sweat lodge deaths,"" said a December 2009 letter to prosecutors from defense attorney Luis Li. ""But these deaths were not the result of criminal conduct. Mr. Ray and his team relied on Angel Valley to provide a safe environment, warned people of the risks, did not force people to participate, did not prevent them from leaving, and did everything they could to prepare for any problems and to assist when problems arose."" Prosecutors claim Ray, 53, was reckless and that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heat stroke. Ray also encouraged participants to hydrate throughout the retreat and warned them the sweat lodge would be very hot, his attorney has said. Participants signed a release form saying that the retreat activities could include a sweat lodge with enclosed spaces and high temperatures, Li said. Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, died on October 8. Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, died on October 17. The sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds, with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes. While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds. In interviews with authorities, some participants recounted feeling distress in the first few rounds. Later, they told police, people began to pass out, others began to vomit and still others went into shock. Some were encouraged to lie down in the dirt to seek relief from the heat. ""(Ray) knew that people were in trouble,"" Tom McFeeley, Brown's cousin, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Monday. ""Those calls for help were ignored."" Ray had conducted the Spiritual Warrior Retreat for six years at a cost of about $10,000 to participants. The sweat lodge, 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide, was built to accommodate up to 75 people.

"(CNN)  -- A collaboration between Twitter and CNN during football's 2010 World Cup in South Africa has landed a top television award for innovation. Tweets soared to a record high during the month-long competition, which was held in Africa for the first time, and in recognition of the new phenomenon, CNN created a data visualization tool to measure the activity. CNN's Twitter Buzz was an interactive screen which reflected the Twitter traffic on a particular topic, usually a player or a team. The more the topic was tweeted, the bigger the picture on the screen. And there were often surprising results. On the first day of the tournament the word ""Bees"" filled the page, a reference to the unique sound of the vuvuzelas which filled every stadium. South Africa 2010 was the first World Cup to be held since Twitter became one of the leading social media technologies and, at its peak, the interactive processed more than 13,000 tweets a minute when England played the United States in a group match on June 12. During the tournament, won by Spain, Twitter Buzz handled more than 11 million World Cup-related tweets. The Twitter Buzz page on CNN.com also attracted a large audience with nearly 700,000 hits. In recognition of its success, CNN won the ""Innovative News"" category at the UK's Royal Televison Society (RTS) Awards. The judges recognized that Twitter Buzz had given TV and internet viewers a unique insight into social media activity during the World Cup. ""It is very gratifying to win in the innovation category, which speaks so much to CNN's commitment to harnessing technology in unique and distinct ways,"" said Tony Maddox, CNN International Managing Director. CNN previously won the same award in 2002 when its satellite telephone technology ushered in a new era of in-the-field newsgathering.","Twitter collaboration lands CNN honor at prestigious television awards .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Thousands of demonstrators, mostly students, lined the streets Friday outside Sanaa University as anti-government protests continued. Anti-government throngs also hit the streets in Aden in southern Yemen, according to eyewitnesses. Eyewitnesses reported that security forces tried to disperse the crowd with tear gas and attacked using batons -- an account authorities disputed. The eyewitnesses said 11 demonstrators in Aden were wounded while one died of gunshot wounds. Authorities insisted no one had been killed. Protests also were reported in the cities of Taiz and Ibb. The protest in Sanaa, the capital, was countered by a pro-government demonstration on Tahrir Square, where thousands waved flags and held up pictures of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. ""We are gathering in support of President Saleh's initiative and to show the international community that we are with Saleh and that the opposition does not control the streets,""  Interior Ministry spokesman Mohammed Maueri said before the demonstration. Anti-government protesters said they were looking for the regime to end. ""This protest and all the following protests are for the fall of the regime,"" said Noman Saleem, an anti-government demonstrator. ""We will not slow down until it falls. Whether it takes place today or  tomorrow, we are patient, and we will wait."" Hasam Zaid, general-secretary for the opposition Haq party, said the Sanaa University gathering is a ""people's protest"" that isn't being coordinated by any particular political party. ""We are joining the youth to be among them and not to lead them,"" he said. Saleh has ruled Yemen since 1978. The country has been wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. High unemployment has fueled much of the anger among a growing young population steeped in poverty. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. Saleh has promised not to run for president in the next round of elections, and he has said he supports the creation of a national unity government to oversee upcoming parliamentary elections. But he has refused to step aside immediately. On Monday, he compared the anti-government protests to an illness sweeping through the region. ""This is a virus and is not part of our heritage or the culture of the Yemeni people,"" he told reporters. ""It's a virus that came from Tunisia to Egypt.  And to some regions, the scent of the fever is like influenza.  As soon as you sit with someone who is infected, you'll be infected.""","Protests are also reported in Aden, Taiz and Ibb .

"(CNN) -- Yemen's main opposition bloc on Monday rejected President Ali Abdullah Saleh's call to form a unity government to rule until elections to replace him, saying its goal is simply ""the fall of the regime."" ""The opposition will not enter a unity government with the ruling party and will stand with the demands of the people,"" said Mohammed Al-Qubati, the spokesman for the Joint Meeting Parties. Saleh is under increasing pressure to resign from youth groups, opposition leaders and even members of his own powerful tribal group, all of whom have called for demonstrations Tuesday against his continued rule. Saleh met Monday with Muslim scholars and members of opposition groups to discuss the possibility of forming a coaltion government that would rule until elections to replace him, according to two Yemeni government sources. But the sources said no agreement had been reached and none was expected on Monday. On Saturday, leaders of two prominent tribal groups, the Hashid-dominated National Solidarity Council and the Baqil tribe, said they would send members to join the protests calling for Saleh's resignation. Saleh is a member of the Hashid tribe. A day later, the Joint Meeting Parties called for demonstrations on Tuesday. That's the first time it has called on its supporters to take to the streets since February 3, which had been branded a day of rage -- a common term for the mass protests that have spread across the Middle East and parts of Africa. Opposition to Saleh has solidified in the wake of violent confrontations between security forces and protesters on Friday, when thousands of anti-government protesters demonstrated in Sanaa, Aden and elsewhere. The clashes left four people dead and 26 wounded, according to medical officials. Amnesty International said it had reports that 11 people died in Friday's protest, bringing the overall death toll since protests began to 27. On Tuesday, Interior Minister Mutahar al-Masri said that three members of security forces died and 10 were wounded in recent protests, according to the official Saba news agency. Saba, citing an unnamed security source, has previously said the government denied shooting protesters. Saleh did not appear to be wavering in his intention to remain in office. He spoke to military leaders Saturday, saying there was a plot against Yemeni unity and saying protesters in Aden were causing damage out of ""selfishness."" Saleh has ruled Yemen since 1978 and has promised not to run for re-election in the next round, but protesters have increasingly argued that nothing less than his resignation will be acceptable to them. The country has been roiled by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. High unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing young population steeped in poverty. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom.

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez claims U.S. criticism of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has a clear aim: military invasion. ""Let's not get carried away by the drums of war, because the United States, I am sure that they are exaggerating and distorting things to justify an invasion,"" Chavez said Monday, according to Venezuelan state media. At a Monday meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was exploring ""all possible options,"" and that ""nothing is off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens."" Asked at a news conference Monday whether the United States planned an imminent military response in Libya, Clinton said, ""No."" Speaking Monday in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, Chavez proposed sending an international committee to Libya to mediate and help develop a peaceful solution to unrest in the North African country. ""Instead of sending Marines and tanks and planes, why don't we send a goodwill commission to try to help so that they do not continue killing in Libya? They are our brothers,"" he said in a speech televised on the government-run network. Chavez and Gadhafi have a close relationship, having bonded partly over shared opposition to U.S. global influence. At a lavish Tripoli celebration commemorating 40 years of Gadhafi's leadership in 2009, the two leaders sat side by side during a two-hour military parade. That same year, a new football stadium in Benghazi, Libya, was named after the Venezuelan leader. As rumors swirled about Gadhafi and his whereabouts last week, some suggested that he may be en route to Venezuela. Those reports proved to be false; the Libyan leader later spoke publicly in Tripoli. But the close ties between the two leaders remain strong. On Monday, Chavez said Gadhafi ""has been my friend and our friend for a long time"" in remarks broadcast on Venezuelan state television. ""We must be cautious. We know what our policy is: We do not support invasions, or massacres, or anything, no matter who does it. But there is no doubt that, regarding Libya, a campaign of lies is being woven -- the same that has been woven about Venezuela for a long time,"" he said. The U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime. The Security Council measures -- which include an arms embargo, an asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and members of his family and associates -- also referred the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the U.S. government was considering the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya. ""Col. Gadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have lost the legitimacy to govern,"" Clinton said Monday. ""And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Gadhafi to go, now, without further violence or delay.""

"(CNN) -- Sitting in a dark, abandoned sports complex with the constant crack of gunshots and the cries of angry protesters ringing in his head, Mounir Benzegala decided he had to leave the bloodshed in Libya once and for all. The 23-year-old American basketball player had tried several times to get to the airport, but his efforts were repeatedly derailed by mercenaries, soldiers, and bureaucratic red tape. Now safely on a U.S.-chartered ferry bound for Malta with about 300 other passengers -- 167 of them fellow Americans -- Benzegala said Friday he'll only let himself feel relief when he's back in the United States. ""There's so many details I just can't get into until I get home and feel safe, but at least I've made it this far,"" said Benzegala, who had come to Libya only three weeks ago to play on a government-run team backed by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's son, Saif. ""I'm just thankful to be alive,"" he told CNN. ""Just unbelievable. ... Anything could have happened. There was no guarantee I was going to get out safely."" Even though he's on his way home to Ohio, he's still haunted by stories of those he left behind, including a teammate who was held at gunpoint by a mercenary one day as he tried to get to the airport. A Libyan soldier was able to calm the mercenary down, Benzegala said. ""He definitely was in serious danger and probably would have been killed. ... The mercenary was very, very violent and aggressive; he just looked like he was itching to shoot somebody."" For Americans Erika and Franz Fearnley, the sound of protests and gunfire that kept getting closer and closer to their neighborhood just outside the Libyan capital ultimately forced them to make a dash for the airport in hopes of leaving the violence behind. ""The crowds sounded as if more and more people were joining in, (and) just hearing the gunfire and just knowing that people were probably losing their lives"" finally made them pack up, Erika Fearnley told CNN's ""Parker-Spitzer"" on Thursday. They and other Americans who have fled Libya's descent into chaos have harrowing tales of escaping the carnage. As Benzegala ran out of food and money -- living off of a single bowl of spaghetti for the past two days -- he decided he had to take a chance and get to the airport to leave the country. It was a fateful decision by the former University of Tampa star point guard, so used to taking chances on the court but feeling out of his element in a foreign city under siege. As the Fearnleys headed to the airport, they were stopped at a checkpoint manned by soldiers with machine guns, a scene Franz Fearnley described as ""terrifying."" ""They knocked on the window... they wanted to see our passports,"" he explained. ""It was scary,"" Erika Fearnley added. Salah Gamoudi, 24, returned to Oregon on Tuesday from Libya, where the dual citizen was working with Ernst & Young as an auditor of oil companies. As security forces started cracking down on protesters, Gamoudi said he, like other Tripoli residents, became fearful for his life and the lives of his family members. He picked up a baseball bat to use as a weapon, if he needed one; his neighbors fortified the streets and guarded their homes. At the airport, the scene was one of confusion and disorder, Benzegala and the Fearnleys said. ""The airport was full to capacity. They were not allowing anyone else in,"" said Franz Fearnley, who had been working on a land development project in Libya for the previous month. But ""our (Libyan) driver had an uncle at the airport, thank God, and he was able to get us in, but once we got in, you couldn't even move"" because it was so crowded, he said. George Sayar, who was in Libya with his Florida-based construction company building roads and bridges, described the airport scene as ""utter chaos."" ""I would say there was approximately 30-40,000 people, most of them without tickets, trying to get into the three entrances to the terminal,"" Sayar told CNN on Friday. ""We pretty much had to push and shove our way through thousands of people, and myself and two of my colleagues finally made it after about three hours of pushing, shoving, and kicking."" Another contractor who managed a tight escape was Cyrus Sany, who was working as an electrical engineer in Libya for a Virginia-based firm. He said it took him six hours to get from the airport parking lot to the ticket counter. Sany said it was a ""very extreme experience"" that he'll never forget. Benzegala found himself crushed between the gates and travelers storming to get in after he arrived at the airport. ""I got in a skirmish, actually, trying to calm people down and got pushed to the ground by a guard and when I got up he hit me in the face and there were a couple other guys I saw get hit as well."" In the end he got a ticket and arrived at the departure area, but that was the end of the line. Immigration officials saw that there was no entrance stamp on his U.S. passport, and refused to let him board his flight, or book a new ticket out. Benzegala is a dual U.S.-Algerian citizen and had used his Algerian passport to enter the country. He said he didn't think twice when he turned the passport over to his agent after getting the entrance stamp. He returned to the abandoned sports complex and managed to call the U.S. Embassy, but officials there would only tell him to keep away from the windows and wait out the violence. He learned about the chartered ferry in talking to CNN, and decided to make a run for it around dawn Wednesday when the fewest number of people were in the streets. Calls to his agent finally got through and his Algerian passport was returned along with a ride out to the port. His teammate, a U.S. resident whose name Benzegala didn't want published for fear of his safety, didn't think he'd be allowed on the ferry since he was not yet a U.S. citizen. He planned to make another attempt to get to the airport, but his whereabouts are unknown. On board the ferry, Benzegala said people stretched out on the floors to sleep, feeling safe at last. Those awake shared stories about their escape and the violence they had witnessed, but also fears about friends and family left behind. A U.S. Embassy official on board the ship, which was delayed for nearly two days because of high seas, warned Benzegala not to speak to the media before departure, explaining that revealing details about the situation could jeopardize the safety of all those on board. As for the Fearnleys, now staying with family in New Jersey, they're also worried about the friends they left behind. ""It's just sad,"" Franz Fearnley said.

"(CNN) -- Union workers and activists who refused to leave the Wisconsin Capitol building Sunday, against orders, will be allowed to spend the night, police said. Authorities had set a deadline earlier in the day of 4 p.m. CST for demonstrators to leave the building, saying it needed to be cleaned after roughly two weeks of protests. While many people left, hundreds of others defied the order and remained inside. Some say they are willing to risk arrest in a conflict that has become a flash point in the nation's debate around labor unions . ""We have the right to be here. This is the people's house. This is a house of labor. This is a house that Wisconsin built,"" Mahlon Mitchell, president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin, said from inside the Capitol. Protesters are upset with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's call to curb collective bargaining rights. The embattled first-term Republican has shown no sign of backing down and defended his proposal Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Wisconsin is ""broke,"" and unions use their power to block necessary cost-saving measures, Walker argued. ""It's about time somebody stood up and told the truth in this state, and said, 'Here's our problem, here's the solution,' and acted on it,"" he said. ""Because if we don't, we fail to make a commitment to the future."" Minutes later on the program, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka assailed Walker. ""This isn't about the budget crisis,"" Trumka said, adding that Walker's arguments have ""migrated"" as his justifications have been refuted. ""Governors that are willing to sit down and work with their employees can work out problems,"" Trumka said. ""We can solve them. But that's not what Governor Walker is doing. He says, 'I won't talk to you.' "" Walker will talk to big contributors, but he ""won't talk to employees,"" Trumka added. Earlier on CNN, another union head also accused the governor of using financial arguments as a deceit. ""Walker is saying it's a budget crisis when it isn't a budget crisis,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""The workers have already said publicly, because he refuses to meet with them, that they would take the cuts to take-home pay that he has asked for here. So this is a ruse to shift power to his friends, because at the same time what he said was that he wanted to give tax breaks to the friends who put him into power."" The Wisconsin Assembly has passed a Republican bill that would strip most state workers of the bulk of their collective-bargaining rights. Among other things, the measure would require workers -- with the exception of police and firefighters -- to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions. Collective bargaining would be limited to wages, though any pay increases beyond the inflation rate would be subject to voter approval. The bill must now clear the Wisconsin Senate. However, 14 Democratic senators have fled to neighboring Illinois to prevent a quorum from voting on the issue. Walker called on the lawmakers to ""come back and do their job."" ""If we fail to pass this bill by Tuesday, we lose $165 million worth of savings. If we continue down that path we start seeing layoffs,"" he warned. Walker repeatedly cited his experience as a local official in explaining his call to curtail bargaining rights for government. As a county executive, he tried ""modest"" changes in pensions and health care, and tried to implement a 35-hour work week ""to avoid massive layoffs and furloughs,"" Walker said. ""And the unions said, 'Forget it.' Emboldened by the fact that they had collective bargaining agreements, they said, 'Go ahead, literally lay off 400 or 500 people.' "" Asked why the exemption for firefighters and police, Walker responded the decision ""boils down to public safety."" If any firefighters or police were to walk off the job in protest, ""I can't afford to have a fire or crime committed where there's a gap in service."" Walker also defended himself against attacks stemming from a prank call in which he thought he was speaking privately to a wealthy conservative activist. The caller was in fact liberal blogger Ian Murphy, who posted the call online. At one point in the call, Walker said, ""This is our time to change the course of history."" Critics say his comment is a sign that he is an ideologue looking to reshape the system and end collective bargaining power rather than a pragmatic governor looking to balance a budget. ""I do believe that. This is our moment in Wisconsin's history,"" Walker told NBC. He added that ""legislatures before have kicked the can"" by not providing long-term fixes. ""I make no apology for the fact this is an important moment in time,"" he said. In the prank call, Murphy suggested ""planting some troublemakers"" among people protesting the measure in Madison. ""We thought about that,"" Walker replied in the call. Asked Sunday whether he had really thought about such an idea, he responded, ""We rejected that."" Government officials looked at ""all sorts"" of suggestions, and rejected that idea ""because we've had a civil discourse,"" he said. Weingarten, speaking to CNN, said workers in Wisconsin have sent a message to Walker that ""'we understand and we will do our fair share.'"" But Walker is sending a different message, Weingarten said: ""'I'm just taking away your voice at work.'"" In the long term, that message ""is ridiculous because collective bargaining is the way to increase quality,"" she said. When President Barack Obama was campaigning in 2007, he made a promise: ""If American workers are being denied their right to organize and collectively bargain when I'm in the White House, I'll put on a comfortable pair of shoes myself. I'll walk with you on the picket line as president of the United States of America because workers deserve to know that somebody is standing in their corner,"" he said during a speech in Spartanburg, South Carolina, on November 3, 2007. While the president has publicly expressed support for those fighting to keep collective bargaining in Wisconsin, he has not joined them at protests. But Trumka of the AFL-CIO insisted that Obama, who faces federal budget challenges, is ""doing it the right way."" ""He's not taking on workers like Scott Walker is and trying to take away their ability to come together and negotiate a middle-class way of life,"" Trumka said.","NEW: Police say that protesters already in the Capitol building will be allowed to spend the night .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Ivory Coast security forces loyal to incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo used tear gas and fired into the air to disperse supporters of Alassane Ouattara, authorities said Saturday. Casualties could not be confirmed. The international community has pressed incumbent Gbagbo to relinquish power to Ouattara, who foreign powers say won the election. Hundreds of pro-Quattara supporters gathered on the first day of rallies calling for Gbagbo's ouster when the security forces moved in, said police Lieutenant Djedje. Ouattara has likened the planned mass protests to those in Egypt. Gbagbo has imposed a curfew until Monday morning. Saturday's clash occurred 48 hours before the arrival in Abidjan of the five heads of state designated by the African Union to find a ""binding decision"" to the Ivory Coast election standoff. Before traveling to Ivory Coast, the heads of state will first hold a meeting in Mauritania on Sunday. They will review the report by a team of experts, whom they sent early this month in Abidjan to work with the parties at stake in the conflict. Chaired by Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, the panel includes Jacob Zuma from South Africa, Blaise Compaore from Burkina Faso, Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania and Idriss Deby Itno of Chad. Two leading Ivory Coast banks closed their doors, raising fears that a money shortage will worsen the crisis in the West African nation. Mounting security concerns prompted BICICI and Citibank to suspend operations Monday. Ivory Coast has been in crisis since a late November election that ended in dispute. The political standoff in the country has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002. More than 33,000 people have fled to neighboring Liberia since the crisis began; 20,000 more have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations.","Police: Security forces disperse Ouattara supporters .

"(CNN) -- U.S. law enforcement seized thousands of pounds of drugs and arrested hundreds of people in a synchronized bust targeting Mexican drug cartels and their associates, federal authorities said Friday. The sweep involved several local, state and federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a statement from that organization. Together, they arrested 676 people and seized more than $12 million, 282 weapons and 94 vehicles around the United States. In addition, nearly 40,000 pounds of marijuana, 467 kilograms of cocaine, 64 pounds of methamphetamine and 21 pounds of heroin were captured in the operation, the statement said. John Morton, the immigration and customs agency's director, said the effort showed what U.S. law enforcement could do when working together on the issue, while stressing that its work wasn't complete. ""Through our continued coordination and cooperation with Mexican law enforcement, ICE agents and officers will strike at the very heart of these organizations by seizing the drugs, guns and money that fuel their criminal enterprises,"" Morton said. The joint operation began Wednesday, roughly a week and a half after immigrations and customs' agent Jaime Zapata was ambushed on a highway while working in Mexico. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Michael Sanders said the agencies are trying to send a message to cartel operatives in the United States. He described most of the targets as mid- to high-level dealers, the type who have day jobs but work in cells that distribute drugs and return drug money to Mexico. A Houston police officer was shot Thursday as he tried to serve a narcotics warrant while taking part in the sweep. Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. The suspect's condition was unknown, police spokesman Kese Smith said. Houston police officer Nash Patel was struck in the elbow and lower backside but was in good condition at the hospital, Smith said. The people arrested this week belong to several cartels, Sanders said. The cells tend to be small and work in an isolated fashion, so it's possible that multiple cells from the same cartel may operate in the same city without knowing each other. Those arrested could face federal drug charges or various state charges, depending on the evidence collected. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Law enforcement agencies work together to target Mexican drug cartel operations in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Before there was a Tea Party, there was Mary Rakovich. Rakovich is an anti-abortion rights, pro-environment vegetarian living in Florida with her husband and nine cats. Many Tea Party activists believe she was one of the first people to publicly protest President Obama's economic policies. In February 2009, Obama was in a Fort Myers, Florida, event hall pitching his stimulus plan. Rakovich stood alone outside the hall, speaking against it. For that, she is considered to be a sort of ""Godmother"" of the Tea Party movement. Nine days after Rakovich's protest, CNBC business reporter Rick Santelli publicly mounted his own campaign against the president's $75 billion plan to help struggling homeowners. It happened as Santelli reported live from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on February 19, 2009. ""The government is promoting bad behavior,"" he said in a tirade, claiming that all Americans would be forced to ""subsidize the losers' mortgages."" The stimulus bill ""had nothing to do with job creation whatsoever,"" Rakovich said in an interview with CNN last summer. And though she rails against government spending, Rakovich relies on one of the biggest spending programs, Medicare, to care for her two bad hips. ""I do believe that there are times when we need the government to have some type of stopgap measures to help get people back on their feet,"" Rakovich said. ""Those types of people need help. I also believe that as an overall system, that Medicare, as well as Medicaid, they're broken systems -- they are systems that need to be revived and revamped.""

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic matched Roger Federer's feat of three successive titles at the Dubai Tennis Championships by crushing the world No. 2 in Saturday's final. The Serbian, who also beat Federer in the Australian Open semifinals last month on the way to winning his second grand slam, triumphed 6-3 6-3 in one hour and 11 minutes to clinch the 20th ATP Tour crown of his short career. The 23-year-old, seeded second, claimed the $386,000 first prize as he denied his Swiss opponent a fifth title in Dubai and 68th overall. ""Any time I win against Roger it's a great success because he's such a great player. We all know how mentally strong of a player he is,"" Djokovic, who trailed 3-1 in the second set, told the ATP Tour website. ""To be able to win against Roger in straight sets as I did tonight is incredible, but I want to keep on going. This match has probably been one of the best that I played this year. ""I feel physically well, fit, mentally motivated to do even more coming up to Indian Wells and Miami where I haven't done well in the last years. Going into the match, Federer held a 13-7 career advantage over Djokovic and was 3-2 ahead in finals, but the world No. 3 is now unbeaten in 14 matches going back to December's Davis Cup final. It was Federer's second defeat in a Dubai final, having also lost in 2006 to current No. 1 Rafael Nadal before bouncing back to triumph for the fourth time the following year. It was only the third time in the event's 19 stagings that the top two seeded players had met in the title match. ""This one has been one of the rather disappointing matches for me against him,"" Federer said. ""I can't play great every time either. So it's been a tough one, but I'm not too disappointed. It's another final for me. I tried tonight -- it just didn't really happen for me."" Meanwhile, women's No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki suffered a surprise defeat to third-ranked Russian Vera Zvonareva in the final of the Qatar Ladies' Open on Saturday. The Dane went into the match having not dropped a set all week after reclaiming the top spot from Kim Clijsters on the way to winning the title in Dubai, but lost 6-4 6-4 in Doha. Second seed Zvonareva, the runner-up the last time the tournament was held in 2008, clinched her 11th WTA Tour victory and leveled her head-to-head record against the 20-year-old Dane at 4-4. ""Caroline is No. 1 and playing very well. I was just fighting for every point and trying to go for my shots,"" Zvonareva told the WTA website. ""This is definitely a special moment for me, especially after that tough match against Daniela (Hantuchova) and another great one against Jelena (Jankovic)."" Wozniacki, who ended 2010 at the top of the rankings before surrendering it briefly to Australian Open champion Clijsters, said she was happy with her week. ""Vera played a great match and a great tournament. I'm happy to be in the finals -- it was another great tournament for me and I always enjoy being back in Doha.

"London (CNN) -- Passengers struggling to get away for the holiday season faced further frustration and delays Tuesday, as the EU's top travel official slammed snow disruptions across the region as ""unacceptable."" Heavy snow caused severe disruption to train and plane schedules in a number of major cities days before Christmas, forcing thousands of people to sleep in terminals while they waited for information on their onward journey. ""I am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across Europe caused by severe snow. It is unacceptable and should not happen again,"" European Commission Vice President Siim Kallas said in a written statement. He took issue with airport infrastructure which he called the ""weak link"" in the chain, and urged airports to ""get serious"" about planning for severe weather conditions. Thousands of passengers endured another frustrating day at London's Heathrow Airport Tuesday as airlines struggled to clear the backlog of passengers after two days of cancellations. Only one of the airport's two runways was operating, following cancellations during the previous two days due to heavy snow. British Prime Minister David Cameron discussed the weather chaos with his cabinet ""extensively"" Tuesday, according to his office. ""The people stuck here are having an incredibly difficult time, especially just a few days from Christmas, and everything must be done to either get them on holiday or get them home safely,"" Cameron said at a news conference. Kylie Deegennars said she had been sleeping on the terminal floor since arriving at Heathrow late Saturday. ""We got told on that evening that if we waited until 6 a.m. the next morning we'd get more information. We did not get a blanket or a bottle of water until 1:30 a.m. in the morning,"" she said. Conditions hadn't improved since then and Monday night she was still waiting for confirmation of a flight. ""We're younger, we've got resistance, but there are babies, there are elderly people, and they're getting no extra treatment than anyone else. It's disgusting,"" she said. On Tuesday afternoon, British Airways announced that it was considering transporting passengers stranded at Heathrow by bus to other UK airports. Terminal five, it said, had been closed as staff worked to clear the backlog of people crowding the main concourse. London Heathrow is to remain open for the next 24 hours, British Airways said, adding that it was considering bringing planes back overnight to clear the load. Gatwick airport officials indicated Tuesday evening that operations were nearing normal. Nearly 700 flights were scheduled to arrive or depart the airport Tuesday carrying about 100,000 passengers, an airport spokeswoman said, and only 53 flights had been canceled. ""The airfield teams are continuing  to work round the clock and we are in a strong position to get flights moving to as near normal operations later today,"" Gatwick spokeswoman Andrea Hopkins said. The airport has requested additional snow-clearing equipment to be delivered from Switzerland in an effort to make operations fully functional. Colleagues Sharon and Cathy were trying to get back to Phoenix, Arizona, after suffering a two-day delay to their flights from Munich, Germany. They have been stranded at Heathrow airport since Monday. ""We really felt that we were flying into the eye of the storm and it didn't make much sense to do that, but here we are. We've been told our best chance of getting out is on December 27,"" Sharon said. The colleagues say they are ""lucky"" to be put up in a hotel by their company, and expressed sympathy for others stranded in the airport with little or no information, accommodation or money. ""It looks like a refugee camp. People have been staying there for days,"" Sharon said. ""There were guards at the doors of Terminal One not allowing other people to come in. We were a little concerned about leaving the terminal that we might not be able to get back in."" The British government has come under fire for failing to heed warnings about the incoming inclement weather. Defending the government, UK Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said, ""Nobody foresaw the really extreme temperatures that we've had."" He laid the blame for chaos at Heathrow Airport firmly at the door of airport operator BAA who he said made a ""bad call"" on Saturday when the snow first started to present problems. ""This is as a result of extreme weather conditions and also to be frank of a bad call on Saturday by the airport operator who was, as it turned out, over-optimistic about their ability to leave the airport open,"" he said. The government had offered military manpower to help clear runways which had been rejected, Hammond said. He added that the government was working with authorities to ensure the smooth supply of de-icing equipment and other materials to keep the airport operating. British transport expert David Quarmby, author of an independent audit on the resilience of England's transport system, said that the country could not be expected to be able to cope as well as other cities that regularly experience heavy snowfall. ""We had a severe winter last winter and a bit of a winter the year before. But for eight years before that we hardly saw any snow at all,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to justify investing in the resources that you find in airports and rail systems and highways in countries elsewhere which always have winters that are as severe as the one that we've got at the moment."" The travel disruption was not limited to airports. Long queues snaked around St. Pancras International railway station in London on Tuesday as Eurostar canceled 10 trains, or about 20% of its normal service between London and Paris. ""Due to the continuing bad weather, speed restrictions are in place on our high speed lines, adding up to two hours to journey times. As a result we can not operate as many trains as planned,"" said Eurostar spokeswoman Mary Walsh. Passengers ignored advice to turn up at the station one hour before departure. Some queued for as long as four hours in the London drizzle before stepping foot inside the terminal. During the wait, they were offered pizza, curry, coffee and tea, according to CNN's Jim Boulden. Earlier, hundreds of passengers camped at Paris train stations, including Eurostar's Paris terminal, Monday night while they waited news of the next train, French transport minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told French radio Tuesday. Around 3,000 passengers on cancelled flights slept on the floor at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, while another 400 spent the night at Orly airport, she said. Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, CEO of Air France KLM said efforts had been made to find stranded passengers a hotel room. ""We found 4,000, but we couldn't find anymore,"" Gourgeon told French radio. A message on the Paris airports website said air traffic was ""slowly resuming"" after severe snow disruptions. Passengers were advised to check whether their flights had been cancelled before traveling to the airport. Heavy snowfall halted all plane travel at Frankfurt airport in Germany for a short time Tuesday, said Thomas Uber, an airport spokesman. By mid-morning in Europe, the number of canceled flights had risen to 464, mostly due to backlogs and disruptions at other airports, an official said. About 50 flights had been canceled at Munich airport, also due to disruptions elsewhere. German Transport Minster Peter Ramsauer has asked German state authorities to allow night flights on a case-by-case basis to ease travel chaos at airports. Major German airports have restrictions on night flights usually from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. and only allow night flights on a very limited basis or in cases of emergencies. On Tuesday afternoon Belgian authorities had started putting passengers whose flights had been diverted from Heathrow Airport to Brussels on coaches and boats to London. In a statement posted on its website, the airport advised passengers bound for Frankfurt on Lufthansa flights to make their way independently by train or car. European Commission Vice President Kallas said he would convene a meeting of European airport representatives in coming days to demand an explanation and assurances that they can handle future snow disruptions. ""We have seen in recent years that snow in Western Europe is not such an exceptional circumstance. Better preparedness, in line with what is done in Northern Europe is not an optional extra, it must be planned for and with the necessary investment, particularly on the side of the airports,"" he said. The UK's Met Office, the country's weather forecasting agency, said it is not expecting further snow in London on Wednesday and that Heathrow and Gatwick airports ""should remain dry.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates, in what he said is his final address to the cadets at the U.S. Military Academy, warned Friday against the United States getting involved in another major land battle. He told the cadets that wars like Afghanistan are not likely, and in fact he would advise against it. ""In my opinion, any future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should 'have his head examined,' as Gen. MacArthur so delicately put it,"" Gates said. Gates remarks contrasted with some in America who are pushing for the U.S. military to take a more active role in other places like Libya, where huge groups of protesters are trying to overthrow the government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi. The defense secretary told cadets they'll be leading a force that has drastically changed how it fights. Gates, who has previously announced he intends to retire this year, said it's impossible to know what the next war, that these cadets will be part of, will look like. ""When it comes to predicting the nature and location of our next military engagements, since Vietnam, our record has been perfect,"" he said. ""We have never once gotten it right, from the Mayaguez to Grenada, Panama, Somalia, the Balkans, Haiti, Kuwait, Iraq and more -- we had no idea a year before any of these missions that we would be so engaged."" But he said he is confident that future engagements involving the Army will less likely include head-on clashes of large mechanized armies. ""In the competition for tight defense dollars within and between the services, the Army also must confront the reality that the most plausible, high-end scenarios for the U.S. military are primarily naval and air engagements,"" he said. He told the cadets at West Point that preparing themselves for a range of possible missions is a key to success. ""The military will not be able to train or educate you to have all the right answers -- as you might find in a manual -- but you should look for those experiences and pursuits in your career that will help you at least ask the right questions,"" he said. Gates encouraged the future Army officers to look outside the armed forces for experiences that will make them better soldiers and leaders. ""Such opportunities might include further study at grad school, teaching at this or another-first rate university, spending time at a think tank, being a congressional fellow."" And he encouraged them to ""become a master of other languages and cultures."" He said it's not just the cadets who need to adjust to this new world, it's the Army itself. He said that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have created a group of highly-experienced, battle tested young officers who too often leave the Army just when it needs their skills and knowledge the most. ""Men and women in the prime of their professional lives, who may have been responsible for the lives of scores or hundreds of troops, or millions of dollars in assistance, or engaging in reconciling warring tribes, they may find themselves in a cube all day re-formatting power point slides, preparing quarterly training briefs, or assigned an ever expanding array of clerical duties,"" Gates said. ""The consequences of this terrify me."" He said the Army must adapt so that young officers with diverse experience and accomplishments are rewarded with promotions and that it must ""re-think the way it deals with the outstanding young leaders in its lower and middle-ranks."" He wrapped up his speech on a personal note, telling the cadets said he feels responsible for each and every one of them ""as if you were my own sons and daughters,"" Gates said apparently on the verge of tears. ""I bid you farewell and Godspeed.""","Future wars will likely be air and sea based, Gates says .

"(CNN)  -- Birmingham City upset Arsenal 2-1 to win the English League Cup at Wembley Sunday, ending a 48-year wait for a major trophy. The defeat prolonged Arsenal's six-year wait for silverware of their own, having gone into the final as overwhelming favorites. Serbian striker Nikola Zigic put Birmingham ahead after 28 minutes before Robin van Persie equalized six minutes before halftime. The match looked headed into extra time until substitute Obafemi Martins scored a last-minute winner. The Nigerian international pounced after a dreadful mix-up between Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny and defender Laurent Koscielny gifted him a chance he gratefully accepted. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" but for his Birmingham counterpart Alex McLeish, it was the exact opposite. ""It feels like the best ever win of my life,"" said the 52-year-old, who won seven trophies while in charge of Scottish giants Rangers. ""In relative terms for us to put one over Arsenal is a titanic result,"" he told BBC Sport. The match begun and ended in dramatic fashion and after only two minutes Birmingham were denied a penalty which should have also seen Szczesny sent off. A clever pass from Zigic sent Lee Bowyer racing through on goal and the midfielder rounded Szczesny only to be brought down by the giant keeper. But instead of a red card and a spot-kick, Arsenal were given a big let-off when Bowyer was ruled offside. TV replays showed Bacary Sagna had been playing Bowyer yards onside. After the exchange of first half goals, a header after a corner for the giant Zigic, and a fine volley by Dutch star van Persie, Arsenal, bidding for a quadruple, looked the more dangerous. Birmingham goalkeeper Ben Foster, named man of the match, pulled off a string of fine saves, with Samir Nasri twice denied. But Birmingham were also dangerous in sporadic attacks and substitute Jean Beausejour set up Keith Fahey for a 57th minute shot against the foot of the post with Szczesny well beaten.","Birmingham City beat Arsenal 2-1 in English League Cup final at Wembley .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people demonstrated against Yemen's longtime president Thursday, demanding the kind of change that forced Tunisia's president from office earlier this month. There were at least four demonstrations Thursday in the capital Sanaa, local journalists told CNN. Security was out in force, but there were no reports of violence. A much smaller number of people turned out to demonstrate in favor of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the sources said. Egypt is also wracked by protests in the wake of the demonstrations that unexpectedly forced Tunisia's longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to leave the country. Yemen has become a key al Qaeda battleground, with Yemeni security forces carrying out offensives against suspected militants. The United States has sent top officials to Yemen and vowed support for the government's fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as the local branch calls itself. A Yemeni rights activist, whose arrest sparked an international outcry and domestic protests, was released from prison Monday and said there is a revolution taking place in her country. Authorities arrested Tawakkol Karman over the weekend, accusing her of organizing anti-government protests in Sanaa. They let her go after more than 5,000 protesters gathered in her support. She had initially refused to leave prison until officials also agreed to free other activists detained over the weekend, she said. ""This revolution going on in Yemen was inspired by Tunisia's 'Jasmine Revolution' and we are now having a 'Jasmine Revolution' in Yemen,"" Karman told CNN soon after her release. ""The huge amount of pressure coming from the people here will force President Saleh to leave office."" Karman, who heads the Women Journalists Without Chains organization, said she was arrested Saturday night near her home. People in Yemen are upset because the parliament is considering loosening the rules on presidential term limits. That has sparked concerns among the opposition that Saleh might try to appoint himself president for life. Saleh has been in office for some 32 years and was last re-elected in 2006. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Thousands demonstrate against President Saleh .

"(CNN) -- A fan recently summed up his feelings about NFL arenas in a blog post: Religions have their churches, and sports teams have their stadiums. As the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers leave their fans' places of Sunday worship to face off in the Super Bowl, one of the world's top sports arena architects shared a story that illustrates why some facilities are better than others. Rewind to 1998, when James Poulson and five top colleagues from the architectural firm now known as Aecom Ellerbe Becket were camping out in the office suite of Microsoft co-founder and Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen. The pressure was on Poulson's self-described ""SWAT team"" to design a new stadium with built-in advantages for the home squad -- a stadium that would act as the Seahawks' virtual 12th man. ""The whole concept was to create a place at one end of the field for the real crazies who like to paint themselves blue and green,"" Poulson recalls. ""The stands would be made of steel -- so when you stomp your feet, it made noise."" But the area also needed to have a great view that wasn't blocked by the giant video scoreboard. During a ""pretty intensive roll-up-your-sleeves work-all-night atmosphere,"" crude models were built, handmade sketches were pinned to the office walls, and eventually, the presentation was ready for Allen. ""We brought in this model with little blue lights built into it, and we turned off the room lights and turned on the blue lights in the model,"" Poulson said. ""Paul was like a little kid with a new toy. He was so excited with the potential of something like that."" Looking straight at Poulson, Allen asked, ""Where has this been done before?"" Nowhere, Poulson told him. ""Great, we're going to do it."" Infrastructural adversary . From there began Qwest Field's reputation as an infrastructural adversary for any visiting NFL team. Not only was the end zone noisy, the entire stadium seemed to amplify the crowd noise and focus it onto the field. Now the arena is among the top delay-of-game venues in the league -- much to the chagrin of Seahawks opponents. More ideas flowed onto the blueprints. The stadium was positioned so that Seattle's infamous horizontal rain would pelt the opponents' sideline area -- but not the home team's sideline.""It was a calculated risk,"" Poulson admitted. ""We knew where the rain was coming from, and we knew which way the stadium had to be oriented for percentage angles."" A recent report in Discovery News suggested that foot-stomping fans at Qwest might actually create their own mini-earthquakes. Poulson explained, ""We don't recruit players, and we don't build teams, and we don't coach. We try to create an environment that's conducive to spectacular athletic performance."" Welcome to the era of the NFL super stadium: a high-tech sports sanctuary designed to win more games, make more money and please more fans. ""The buildings aren't always getting bigger, but they are getting smarter,"" says Christopher Lamberth, of 360 Architecture. It's a time when rabid football followers name their pets after their favorite arenas, like Heinz. It's a world where PETA praises animal-friendly NFL stadiums, such as the Packers' newly renovated Lambeau Field for its ""hearty, meat-free fare."" It's also when fans aren't satisfied by simply sitting in the stands and watching a game on the field. They can do that at home, Lamberth said. But what they'll never replicate with at-home viewing is the vibe of actually being where the game is. So now, the idea is to combine the best of both worlds: at home and at the field. ""You can go sit in the upper deck and still have a good time,"" Lamberth said. ""You can watch from a concession-area monitor. Or if you want to tailgate it in the parking lot and watch it on satellite, that's great, too."" Either way, fans come away with a game-day experience. Stadiums are reflecting this attitude by bringing to the field more of the comforts and gadgets of home -- luxury boxes, multiscreen video and top-notch concessions. Design trends follow with wider stadium concourses and large, open plazas surrounding the arenas.  Tailgating on steroids . This weekend's Super Bowl has embraced the idea as a way to boost attendance toward the 100,000 mark. Tickets: $200 a head. Experiencing the vibe of the Super Bowl parking lot: priceless.  At Lambeau, where Wisconsin's brutal cold often provides a home field advantage, the stadium has sponsored its own sort of tailgate-party-on-steroids called The Tailgate Tundra Zone. Up to 4,000 partying Cheeseheads take over a couple hundred parking spots with the team's blessing. With about 84,000 fans on a waiting list for season tickets, the Tundra Zone is the next best thing to being inside a stadium that has sold out its past 290 games. Getting intimate at Heinz Field . In Pittsburgh, cold winds off the Ohio River blast into the open end of Heinz Field, creating a home field advantage for visiting teams' inexperienced kickers. The arena is considering adding 4,000 seats, and plans are under way to connect Heinz to downtown with a light-rail line. Heinz and many of the league's other newer or newly renovated stadiums offer ""intimate"" settings. Fewer seats are in the end zone, and more seats are closer to the field. Spectators have a more direct line of sight to the action. And then, of course, there's the amazing 21st century technology. At the home of the Arizona Cardinals, the 19 million-pound field turf rolls from inside the stadium to the outside, so the grass can bask in the Phoenix sunshine. Cowboys Stadium's retractable roof is touted as the largest of its kind in the world. It opens or closes in just 12 minutes. Media technology is built into the backbone of the NFL's New Meadowlands Stadium in New Jersey. Opened in 2010, the home to New York's Jets and Giants boasts four huge HD video scoreboards -- one for each corner of the field. Most stadiums have two -- one in each end zone. For Jets games, ticket holders have access to a new hand-held sports video device called FanVision, which feeds detailed game stats and shows replays from several exclusive camera angles that fans wouldn't see anywhere else. Also, concession technology at Meadowlands speeds up purchases and shortens lines. Stadium operators can track sales data in real time. Faster than you can spell 'Roethlisberger' Meadowlands' Wi-Fi capacity is huge, said William Squires, an ex-Giants vice president who consults for the new stadium. ""You have fans trying to upload photos or video, and some of these stadiums just can't handle it,"" he said. ""But we think we're ahead of the times when it comes to that. Our wireless abilities are pretty much off the charts."" Fans of the sci-fi film ""Blade Runner"" recall the giant video walls emblazoned on skyscrapers of the future. In the real world, stadium designers are moving in this direction. American Airlines Arena, which is home to the NBA's Miami Heat, was one of the first sports facilities to use MediaMesh technology that turns building facades into giant video screens. Look for this trend to continue and intensify. Video projected on the building will reveal upcoming games or live broadcasts of the games being played inside. Or, the video facades could offset expensive ticket prices with paid advertising. For future facilities, designers are looking at other ways to transform sports arenas. Organizers of London's 2012 Olympics are interested in venues that can easily transform seating and field configurations from one sport to another. In Qatar, site of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, proposed stadiums include detachable upper tiers. Designers are asking themselves, ""How can we expand or adapt seating capacity?"" Lamberth said. ""The flexibility to host various events is the transformable.""","Super Bowl stadium boosts attendance by selling tickets for the parking lot .

"(CNN) -- A Dutch documentary about a mentally ill and potentially dangerous 18-year-old has prompted lawmakers in the Netherlands -- amid national outrage -- to re-examine the treatment of those in psychiatric care. The documentary, which was produced by the Lutheran-run Evangelical Broadcasting Company and aired on public television Tuesday, followed Brandon van Ingen, a patient at a mental hospital in Ermelo. Since 2007, van Ingen has spent part of his days tethered to a wall due to the danger he poses to others, according to State Secretary for Public Health Marlies Veldhuijzen van Zanten-Hyllner. ""Brandon's issue is so serious that he must be restricted in his freedom for the sake of his own safety and that of others,"" van Zanten-Hyllner wrote in a letter to parliament. ""Because of this, Brandon consistently makes use of a band that he fastens himself when he is in the presence of his attendants and other visitors. Whenever there is no one present and at night, the band is loosened."" In response to the documentary, the country's political parties held emergency meetings Wednesday to discuss care for the mentally ill. Van Zanten-Hyllner addressed those meetings, explaining that van Ingen's care was in line with rules for restraining mental health patients, but promised to examine whether a change is needed. ""The broadcast stirred me deeply,"" she wrote in the letter to parliament. ""It is upsetting to see that such a young person, who has his life before him, has so little perspective for a better future."" Van Zanten-Hyllner noted that van Ingen, who apparently hears voices that tell him to do ""bad and dangerous things,"" has his own apartment where he can move about freely. The hospital is working on alternatives for van Ingen's care, van Zanten-Hyllner wrote, ""and is undertaking constant efforts to improve the living situation."" The program ""Outspoken"" learned about Van Ingen's story from one of his caretakers at the hospital. ""I could no longer do these shifts,"" Iris Mourits said on the program. ""Back-up shifts were OK, but being together with him in a room -- I think at some point he could sense that from the depths of my toes I could no longer see him on that leash."" Van Ingen's mother compared his care to that of a ""caged animal."" ""He feels like a dog on a line,"" she said. Heerenloo hospital issued a statement Saturday assuring family members of those at the facility that van Ingen's case is an exceptional one and doesn't reflect the care the majority of patients receive. Health care inspectors said Friday that they would ""investigate the cases in which freedom is taken away from patients similar to Brandon's situation."" Van Zanten-Hyllner said there are about 40 cases similar to van Ingen's in the Netherlands. CNN's Ben Brumfield and Bharati Naik and Journalist Eline Rietkerk contributed to this report.","A documentary profiled the 18-year-old male's treatment at a mental hospital .

"(CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao this week will lay out his vision for U.S.-Chinese relations based on strategic mutual trust, state-run media reports, amid recent hints of Washington's frustrations with Beijing. Hu is expected to lay out his blueprint during his three days in Washington, where he'll meet with President Barack Obama, top legislators and business executives, followed by a stop in Chicago. A report Sunday in Xinhua, China's official news agency, said that despite certain differences a constructive, comprehensive partnership between the powers could be mutually beneficial and help ensure stability in Asia and worldwide -- points Hu will stress during time in the United States. Zhang Yesui, China's ambassador to the United States, hyped the visit as vital to relations between the Communist state and democratic power, according to another Xinhua report published Saturday. He said that it was important to continue bilateral ties and address issues through dialogue, while adding that disagreements were inevitable given political, cultural and economic differences. Ultimately, Zhang said, the nations can and should create a ""win-win situation"" through positive diplomacy. This hopeful rhetoric, though, comes as officials in Washington have recently suggested that Beijing has been slow to act in some respects, and generally should consider altering its approach to reflect its increasing influence. On Friday, a U.S. delegation sent to China to negotiate economic deals returned from a three-day trip ""highly disappointed"" with the lack of progress, according to a senior administration official. The official, displaying obvious frustration, told CNN that ""prospects for a joint economic statement"" before Hu's visit to the White House ""are hanging by a thread."" Typically the joint statement is a formal expression of agreement between the two countries. A failure to issue one is often considered a sign of failed diplomacy. ""That doesn't mean things can't improve,"" the official said, ""but we haven't seen it yet."" In a speech at the State Department Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that China must assume the responsibility of being a world power, rather than basing policies on its own self-interest. ""Embracing the obligations that come with being a 21st-century power will help to realize a future that will give the Chinese people even more, in fact, unimagined opportunities,"" she said. ""But that means accepting a share of the burden of solving common problems, abiding by and helping to shape a rules-based international order."" Clinton acknowledged that relations between Beijing and Washington were at a ""critical juncture,"" noting persisting tensions on economic and security issues and accusing China of discriminatory practices that put American firms at a disadvantage. Still, insisting that the United States doesn't view China as a threat, she said, ""our economies are intertwined and so are our futures."" ""A thriving America is good for China, and a thriving China is good for America,"" said the top U.S. diplomat. One hot-button issue that Beijing addressed on Sunday was the Korean peninsula, days after Clinton urged China to use its ""unique ties"" with North Korea to tamp down tensions there. Urging an early resumption of long-stalled six-party talks committed to reining in North Korea's nuclear program, Assistant Foreign Minister Hu Zhengyue told Xinhua that ""the peninsula's denuclearization and the normalization of relations"" was in all parties' interest. ""China will continue to work with all the parties concerned and the international community to ensure peace, stability and prosperity,"" he said.","Hu Jintao will lay out a blueprint this week for U.S.-Chinese ties, state-run media says .

"Seattle (CNN) -- The crops for sale carry labels like ""dark vader,"" ""uk cheese"" and ""white russian."" But the overwhelming smell of cannabis gives away the fact that there is really only one item for sale here: medical marijuana. There was little publicity for Seattle's first medical marijuana farmers market held on Sunday. No posters or signs were hung outside the market's venue, a small club where ""erotic poetry"" readings are held. Word of mouth alone though packed the hall as hundreds of people lined up to go in. They gained entrance with a recommendation from a health care provider stating that they need marijuana to treat a medical condition. ""I am actually standing upright because of cannabis, there's nothing else I found that would help me with chronic pain issues,"" said John Muise, a gaunt figure with long dangling dreadlocks. ""I couldn't even explain how my life would be if I didn't have cannabis. I would probably be addicted to opiates and in a wheelchair."" Despite the packed crowds and stands full of marijuana, the farmers market operates in a legal gray zone. ""Medical marijuana is not legal in the state of Washington,"" said state Department of Health spokesman Donn Moyer. A law passed in 1998 allows for what is called the ""medical marijuana defense"" -- that allows for juries to take into account if someone charged with pot possession was taking the drug for health purposes. Under the current law, certain health care providers like doctors or nurse practitioner can issue the recommendations for medical marijuana for a variety of ailments including cancer, HIV and anorexia. But unlike in California or Colorado where medical marijuana initiatives led to an explosion of dispensaries that provide the drug, in Washington the medical marijuana community has remained, for the most part, underground. ""Dispensaries are not legal, co-ops are not legal here,"" Moyer said. ""The intent of the law is that you receive medical marijuana from a designated provider who can only help one patient at one time. Some people are interpreting that as they provide marijuana to someone and then 15 minutes later do it again for another patient."" ""It's a city by city, county by county situation right now,"" said Philip Dawdy, a spokesman for the Sunday market and medical marijuana advocate who says there is still ""an old West"" feel to the medical marijuana community in the state. In Seattle, however, medical marijuana users have something of safe haven. A 2003 measure officially pegged arresting people for personal use of marijuana as the lowest priority for the city's police department. Still fears persist among medical marijuana users. At the market, several attendees asked the handful of news crews present not to take images of them. One couple said they would lose their jobs as teachers if the school where they worked found out they were at the event. ""This could be construed as dealing drugs,"" medical marijuana grower Ken Bell said as a line of customers grew in front of his ""Ken's Medicine Bowl"" stand. ""We need the state to clarify the gray areas."" Market organizers said they are hopeful that a bill working its way through Washington's legislature will provide medical marijuana users and growers in the state surer legal footing to operate on. In the meantime, organizers say they will hold more farmers markets and push for medical marijuana rights -- within limits. ""We don't want to be anything like California,"" market spokesman Dawdy said. ""They literally have dispensaries on top of each other in Venice Beach and out in the valley.""","Recommendation from a health care provider needed to shop at the farmers market .

"St Petersburg, Russia (CNN) -- Most artistic directors' first day leading a new ballet company is all about meeting the dancers. But for Nacho Duato it's a challenge just to find the rehearsal room. The mazelike corridors of the magnificent Mikhailovsky Theatre in St Petersburg prove confusing and inspire a few unchoregraphed twists and turns from Duato before he finally identifies the right room and his new company -- the 140 dancers of the Mikhailovsky Ballet. It's unlikely the theater's floor plan will be the last challenge for the Spanish choreographer who, this month, took over leadership of the company. He's the first foreigner to lead a Russian ballet company in over a century and has been charged with bringing modern choreography to the Mikhailovsky's classical repertoire. ""Having a look at the past but always stepping forward and stepping into the future ... this is what I think they want and that is why I think they called me,"" said Duato. ""I think they have it pretty clear that they want to change; that they want something new."" A modern ballet dancer and choreographer with an international pedigree, it is hoped he can revitalize the ballet for Russian audiences. While performances at the Mikhailovsky are well attended, there's a growing concern that Russians may become tired of seeing the standard repertoire of classical ballets. ""Russians love ballet. That goes without saying, but the attitude that exists towards Russian ballet in the West is more passionate,"" said Vladimir Kekhman, billionaire fruit importer and General Director of the Mikhailovsky Theatre. ""I would like that within Russia we would have the same attitude because as we say 'We don't treat what we have until it's gone.' I consider ballet to be a national treasure,"" he added. Kekhman is a relatively recent convert to ballet but he has become something of a cultural entrepreneur, investing $45 million of his own money to restore the Mikhailovsky's buildings and, hopefully, its reputation. Kekhman required fresh talent to oversee his vision and for that, he says, he had to look beyond Russia. ""I looked within our industry to see who were considered living legends of choreography, and when I looked within Russia, I realized that we didn't have choreographers who had the ability to not just choreograph, but also head the company,"" he said. He approached Duato, a non-Russian speaker, who has spent the last 20 years choreographing new works as Artistic Director of the Spanish National Dance Company. At first Duato was reluctant to change direction towards classical ballet. But then Mikhailovsky offered him the chance to bring modern choreography to a classical ballet company and it proved an offer too enticing to pass up. ""I know many people who think he's (Kekhman) crazy, that I'm crazy and that this is never going to work,"" said Duato. ""That this mixture is just like a bomb, an atomic bomb. But he made me feel that 'Let's try, let's do it. Why not? Maybe we can do it.'"" Bringing a modern approach to ballet in Russia, where it's ingrained in the culture might daunt some, but it's a task Duato is relishing. ""It's not a pressure. It's a pleasure. It really is a pleasure to be in a place where ballet (has been) part of the cultural tradition for (such a) long time, and at the same time they want to break through and do new things,"" Duato said. Duato has set himself a challenging schedule, hand-picking three dancers to create a ballet so new it doesn't even have a name yet. They have just weeks before the world premiere. Principal dancer Ekaterina Borchenko is the jewel in the Mikhailovsky's Imperial crown. The company's star ballerina has danced the principal roles in productions of classical ballets including ""Swan Lake,"" ""Giselle"" and ""La Sylphide."" Now, she's relishing the chance to stretch her skills. ""In this repertoire, I can show a different side of myself, express myself differently and find something new in me,"" she said. Opening night will be a litmus test of just how receptive Russians are to this new direction. Duato believes ballet is a living organism, which needs to evolve constantly in order to keep the audience interested. It's a philosophy he shares with Kekhman. ""Together we are going to work into something,"" said Duato. ""We don't know how it's going to be but I think it's going to be beautiful. If we put all our hearts and soul into it, it's going to be something fantastic.""","Spanish choreographer Nacho Duato is the new artistic director at the Mikhailovksy Ballet .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""I'm going to appoint Thurgood Marshall to the (Supreme) Court."" This monumental, unexpected bombshell from President Lyndon Johnson -- spoken in private in the summer of 1965 -- set in motion a history-making drama, revealed for the first time in newly public audio tapes. In secret recordings and transcripts made exclusive to CNN, Johnson laid out a politically crafty plan that was years in the making to groom Marshall as the first African-American on the high court. It was part of a broader White House strategy to implement the president's civil rights agenda, something he openly hoped would cement his legacy and strengthen the Democrats' base. Marshall was unaware of all this when Johnson first called him on July 7, 1965. Marshall, then a federal appeals court judge in New York, had been summoned from lunch. The president, a master persuader, wastes little time making his point: . ""I have a rather big problem that I wanted to talk to you about,"" he says. ""I want you to give it some real thought because it's something that I have thought about for weeks, and I think that we can't think of how it affects us personally. We've got to think about the world, and our country."" ""Yes, sir,"" Marshall replies, the usually verbose judge unable to get many more words in the conversation. Johnson then makes the pitch: ""I want you to be my solicitor general."" ""Wow,"" is all Marshall can say, clearly in disbelief. ""I want the top lawyer in the United States representing me before the Supreme Court to be a negro. And be a damn good lawyer that's done it before. So you have those peculiar qualifications."" He adds, ""I want to do this job that [Abraham] Lincoln started, and I want to do it the right way."" Leaving the security of a lifetime job on the bench for an uncertain political post -- where he could be fired at any time -- at first concerns Marshall, who asks for a day or two to think about the offer. But minutes later, he is sold. ""The answer's 'yes.' "" 'Do it for the people of the world' Then the president offers a tantalizing hint of bigger things to come. ""Nobody will ever know I talked to you. If you decide that you can do it, I think you ought to do it for the people of the world. ... And if there's not something better, which I would hope there would be, that you would be more amenable to, there'll be security for you because I'm going to be here for quite awhile,"" he says confidently. That ""something,"" as later conversations that Johnson has with top aides reveals, is a Supreme Court appointment. It would come two years later in 1967. The solicitor general spot would be a mere prelude to a bigger stage. The tapes are being released by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, which is analyzing and transcribing secret White House tapes from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt to the Richard Nixon years. This latest disclosure comes as Justice Marshall is receiving a fresh burst of attention, thanks to a new play on his life starring award-winning actor Laurence Fishburne. His amazing transformation into the civil rights icon is stunning. HBO will air the play Thursday, videotaped from a performance this past summer at Washington's Kennedy Center. Fishburne told CNN his is an honest portrayal. ""It's all there,"" he said of Marshall, whom he never met. ""I mean, we deal with his flaws and we deal with his strengths. We deal with his history; we deal with his disappointments as well as his victories. So, it's all there. It's all there in the show. Warts and all."" Building on an already strong legacy . Marshall had already cemented his legacy as a pioneering NAACP lawyer who won 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the justices, his future colleagues. That included Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark ruling ending segregation in public schools. By the time of his government appointments, Marshall was in his mid-50s and itching for new challenges. Less than two weeks after his new job offer, Johnson secretly makes clear he wants more for Marshall. On July 20, 1965, the president tells economist and informal adviser John Kenneth Galbraith about a pending Supreme Court vacancy that will ultimately go to Johnson friend Abe Fortas. But Johnson is already laying the groundwork for the next court seat. ""I'm going to appoint Thurgood Marshall to the (Supreme) Court,"" LBJ says flatly. ""Not to succeed him (current Justice Arthur Goldberg), but after he's solicitor (general) for a year. After he's solicitor (general) for a year or two, the first vacancy I have. I haven't told anybody that, and I don't want you to, but I brought him here."" Johnson mentions how Southern Senate Democrats held up Marshall's 1961 appointment to the federal appeals bench for months. The president now believes with Marshall's proven skill as a legal advocate, he would make a good solicitor general, arguing cases on behalf of the federal government before the high court. ""At the end of a year or two,"" in his new job, Johnson predicts, ""no one can say that he's not one of the best-qualified men that has ever [been] appointed. And then I'm going to appoint him"" to the high court. Going to Marshall for advice . With a relationship established, Johnson was not shy about calling on his new solicitor general for some practical political advice. Marshall is asked to suggest names of other black leaders suitable for top administration posts, including agency heads and ambassadorships. The solicitor general suggests Whitney Young, Franklin Williams and Roy Wilkins. Marshall, despite being among just a handful of top black officials in the administration, appears slightly uncomfortable seeming to speak for all African-Americans in a purely political context. ""You got any suggestions, things we ought to be doing in this Negro field that we're not? I see that they say they're getting very disillusioned with Johnson,"" says the president, referring to himself in the third person. ""Well, I'm going to get together with some of them within the two-week period and try to find out what's going on,"" replies Marshall. ""I'm having great difficulty in finding out what they want."" That comment may reflect the internal divisions among many in the civil rights movement over direction and strategy in the wake of passage of the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act and the Rev. Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech just a few years earlier. But it is clear from this conversation that LBJ is using Marshall's grooming for the Supreme Court as the model he will use to boost other outstanding African American candidates to senior government positions. By October 1966, some in the Johnson circle had begun quietly offering trial balloons in the press over whether Marshall might be a suitable justice. One U.S. News & World Report writer suggested he would not. ""Did you see the column today by David Lawrence?"" Johnson asks Nicholas Katzenbach, his former attorney general. ""He's got a mean -- saying that Thurgood's not the best-qualified man. That's the net of it."" In a later conversation, Johnson's reveals Marshall remains on his mind, and he reaches out to key lawmakers and civil rights leaders for their advice. ""I want to build him up where he's impenetrable when he becomes a Supreme Court justice,"" says the president. But he adds the future nominee knows nothing of this. ""I've never told him I'm going to appoint him, and don't know that I am. But he's damn sure going to be qualified."" Opportunity knocks for Johnson . When Justice Tom Clark announced his retirement, the president was ready to make his move. On June 13, 1967, just moments before he separately calls Marshall to be his nominee, Johnson tells Attorney General Ramsey Clark -- whose father Marshall was about to replace -- of his plans. He dismisses whispers from some in Washington that Marshall is not ready to sit on the nation's highest court. ""He doesn't fit the mold. He's not a Yale man and that kind of stuff, you know,"" says Clark helpfully. ""Just a big, easy-going, very humane-type person. He doesn't change his behavior to suit other people. Doesn't wear striped pants. I think it's a combination of those two factors"" the public will embrace. The two men discuss how the Senate Judiciary Committee will treat Marshall, who will be ultimately confirmed later that summer. The day after the historic 69-11 Senate vote, Marshall's wife, Cecilia, known as Cissy to her friends, calls the president personally to thank him. ""Now that I have stopped trembling a little, and now that we're more or less legal, I thought I'd like to call you and thank you again so much for the faith you have shown in Thurgood and so much that you have done for everybody."" Johnson replies in a sweet, soft voice, ""Well, I know he'll be very worthy of it, and I know that both of us will be proud of him."" Marshall served on the Supreme Court until 1991. He died in early 1993.","Secret tapes of President Lyndon Johnson released exclusively to CNN .

"(CNN) -- Singer Stephen Gately, a member of the Irish band Boyzone, died of natural causes, a court spokeswoman on the Spanish island of Majorca said Tuesday. Stephen Gately died Saturday while he and his partner were visiting the Spanish island of Majorca. The court spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified, said Gately, 33, died Saturday of acute pulmonary edema, according to preliminary autopsy reports. There was no sign of violence in his death, the spokeswoman said. The judge has authorized Gately's family to transfer the body out of Spain, the spokeswoman added. According to the Mayo Clinic, pulmonary edema is caused by excess fluid in the lungs. The fluid collects in the lungs' air sacs, making it difficult to breathe. Gately's partner, Andrew Cowles, testified before an investigating magistrate for about 15 minutes Tuesday, while the autopsy was conducted nearby at the island's forensic institute, the court spokeswoman said. Authorities will send samples from the body to a laboratory in Barcelona. Meanwhile, the court will hear testimony from other witnesses, the court spokeswoman said. The case will be shelved judicially only after the definitive laboratory results have been received, confirming the presumed natural death, the spokeswoman said. Health Library: What is pulmonary edema? In a statement on the Boyzone Web site, Gately's fellow bandmates, Ronan Keating, Keith Duffy, Mikey Graham and Shane Lynch said: ""We are completely devastated by the loss of our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all looking forward to sharing many more. ""Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. He lit up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family. We love you and will miss you forever, 'Steo.' "" Boyzone made history in the United Kingdom with 16 consecutive Top Five hits, according to Ticketmaster's Web site. It's one of Ireland's best-selling bands, with six No. 1 singles in the United Kingdom, and four No. 1 albums, Ticketmaster said. The group, which separated in 2000 to pursue solo projects, reunited in 2008. Its greatest hits album -- ""Back Again ... No Matter What"" -- was released last year. Gately joined the band in 1993 after answering an audition ad. ""A lot of people didn't think we would make it out of Ireland back then,"" he said previously on the group's Web site. ""We were overwhelmed when Boyzone began to take off, it was incredible."" CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this story.","Boyzone singer Stephen Gately, 33, died Saturday in Majorca .

"Washington (CNN) -- Astronomers have discovered a new planet that just may be able to support life in a nearby solar system a mere 20 light years from Earth. It's called Gliese 581g and is located in the constellation Libra. It circles the red dwarf star Gliese 581. According to a research that is set to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, the planet is ""squarely in the middle of the habitable zone of the star"" which offers a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet around a very nearby star. When a planet falls in the ""habitable zone"" it means that it orbits the star at a distance that allows for the planet to have both liquid water and an atmosphere, two conditions that are considered important for life to exist. ""Our findings offer a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet,"" said Astronomy Professor Steven Vogt of the University of California Santa Cruz who lead the research along with Astronomer Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institute. To scientists a ""potentially habitable"" planet is not one where humans would want to live, but rather one that could sustain life. The scientists believe the new planet has a mass three to four times that of Earth and orbits its star approximately every 37 days. It's likely rocky planet, according to Vogt. Size is another factor in determining the likelihood of a planet to be able to support life. It has to be large enough to hold an atmosphere, but not so large that it becomes an ""ice giant"" like Neptune or Uranus. ""If we discover life outside our planet, it would perhaps be the most significant discovery of all time,"" said Ed Seidel of the National Science Foundation. ""This is clearly one of the most exciting areas of science these days."" The report can be found at http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph.EP/new.","Gilese 581g is 20 light years from Earth -- a near neighbor by galactic standards .

"New York (CNN) -- Subway passengers who were stranded on Coney Island, New York, because of the overnight snowstorm refused to get off of a train because they had no other way to stay warm, riders said Thursday. The passengers stayed in a ""sweeper"" train, which was supposed to clear tracks and make sure no passengers or trains were stuck between stations, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) said. MTA employees tried to get them off the N Train at the Coney Island terminal, a passenger said. ""I said, 'I have no where to go, I'm not leaving,'"" passenger Eva Mahoney told CNN affiliate NY1. ""There's no way I'm gonna get home because I remember the [December] blizzard."" Many of the passengers slept or just waited for a few hours until they could catch a train around 6 a.m., she said. ""If this train is the sweeper train, put us in the one next to it,"" Mahoney said. The drama began when the riders left Manhattan for Brooklyn, NY1 reported. They were told to get off and take the train to Coney Island. When they arrived there was no bus service, passengers said. That's when they decided to stay on the  sweeper train. MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said that, based on December's storm, the agency ""implemented new strategies last night to ensure the safety of passengers and facilitate a quick return to service this morning."" MTA acted to shut down service so as not to strand passengers, he said in a statement. ""In the case of the N Train, we were able to safely park the train at its Coney Island terminal as planned."" The agency could have done a better job communicating with customers ""on the need to dispatch one of the trains as a nonpassenger sweeper train to clear tracks, and making them comfortable in the terminal until service was restored,"" he said. The major snowstorm that pelted much of the Northeast tapered off Thursday, but many schools, government offices and some airport runways were expected to remain closed, officials said. Storms that stretched from the southern Appalachian Mountains to coastal Massachusetts are the latest in a slew of wintry weather that continues to blanket much of the region. Even though the storm lasted a single day, it caused major problems in some areas, posting record snowfall numbers across the region, according to the National Weather Service. In New York's Central Park, 19 inches of snow fell overnight into Thursday, beating a single day record set in 1925, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters. ""Keep an eye on your neighbors,"" he said, warning New Yorkers to check on elderly residents in neighborhoods across the city. Forecasters said Newark, New Jersey, reached 19 inches of snow, while Philadelphia totaled 15 inches. Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter lifted the city's snow emergency Thursday evening. Bus systems in Philadelphia were running at 10 percent, said mayoral spokeswoman Katie Martin, having been shut down during overnight hours in expectation of the heavy snow fall. Federal employees and most schools in Washington ended business early Wednesday. Public schools and most government offices stayed closed Thursday, officials said. At Philadelphia International Airport, 173 flights were canceled for Thursday as of about 8 a.m., officials said.  About 1,500 passengers were stranded at the airport overnight. At Boston Logan International airport, about 200 flights were canceled Thursday beginning at 6 a.m., officials said. Amtrak suspended service from New York to Boston and from New Haven to Springfield on Thursday, and reduced its service between New York and Albany, the train service said . Runways were closed at Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport in the Washington suburbs on Wednesday evening, said Rob Yingling, spokesman for Metro Washington Airports Authority. ""The intense snow has really been going since late afternoon, and it wasn't too long after that that aircraft activity trailed off dramatically and then subsequently the snow got so heavy that we had to close the runways while we continued plowing them with our snow team,"" Yingling said. But by Thursday afternoon, Dulles airport had reopened a single runway while officials at Reagan National Airport reported they had reopened runways. Also in New York, the city's transit bus service remained suspended in the Bronx, while officials said service is being evaluated and restored on a route by route basis in Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Manhattan, the Metropolitan Transit Authority said Thursday. CNN's Rick Vincent and Julie Cannold contributed to this report.","NEW: Subway passengers commandeered train to stay warm .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters battling a central Florida blaze were scrambling to get ahead of gusty winds that could hamper efforts to battle the fire, which has burned more than 16,000 acres and closed a stretch of Interstate 95 for a time Wednesday. The fire, which began Monday in northern Brevard and southern Volusia counties, has destroyed a mobile home, several outbuildings and several camp structures, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said. As of Wednesday, however, ""no residences seem to be in immediate danger,"" said Sterling Ivey, department spokesman. A 21-mile stretch of I-95 in the two counties was shut down for a few hours because of heavy smoke on Wednesday, the Florida Department of Transportation said. It reopened before 4:30 p.m. More than 150 personnel have been deployed to help fight the blaze, called the Iron Horse Fire, according to the Florida Division of Forestry. The fire is 25% contained, said Cliff Frazier, a wildfire mitigation specialist with the Florida Division of Forestry, and has burned 16,294 acres. Winds were pushing much of the smoke out to sea, Frazier said. No new structures appeared to be in danger. Winds of 15 mph were forecast Wednesday morning, increasing to 25 mph by evening, Annaleasa Winter, a Division of Forestry spokeswoman, told CNN affiliate WPBF. The winds will be out of the northeast and could threaten the western fire lines, she said. Firefighters on Wednesday were planning to help ""mop up those edges"" and put out hot spots, Winter said. Mike Townsend's property in Brevard County was among those scorched by the fire. ""It's heartbreaking,"" he told WPBF tearfully. ""I developed this piece of property by myself. It's a rough thing. It's a rough thing to go through."" Firefighters were making progress on a second blaze that has burned close to 2,000 acres in St. Johns County, south of State Road 206 on Interstate 95 below St. Augustine, officials said. Kimberley Prosser of the Brevard County Fire Department said the agency sent two emergency strike teams as a precaution to two communities near the fire, Lake Harney Woods in Volusia County and Blountes Ridge in Brevard County. A voluntary evacuation in the city of Mims was lifted Tuesday evening and shelters were closed, according to the Brevard County Office of Emergency Management. The agency reported a Brevard firefighter suffered second-degree burns to the face. The cause of both fires is not yet known. Frazier said Tuesday the combination of severe freezes this winter that killed surface vegetation and low rain totals made conditions ripe for a fire. The South Florida Water Management District said Wednesday the central and southern portions of the state are experiencing ""extreme dry conditions."" The period between October 2010 and February 2011 was the driest period in southern Florida in 80 years, the district said. ""Over the last five months, the district's 16-county region has received a total of 5.69 inches, less than half the average rainfall for that period, or 6.54 inches below average,"" the district said in a statement. Lake Okeechobee is more than 2 feet below its historical average for this time of year. Meanwhile, residents near the Iron Horse Fire recalled wildfires that swept the area in 1998, saying the recent blaze brings back their worry and anxiety. In 1998, ""We left about 11 o'clock at night and then we didn't know if we had a home the next morning,"" Denise Kemp told WPBF. Her home survived. But she said the current blaze has her worried because of its size and the changing wind directions.

"(CNN)  -- Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has joined three other ex-leaders of Latin American nations calling for the decriminalization of marijuana. Former Mexico President Vicente Fox says it's time to open the debate on legalizing marijuana. Fox, who was Mexico's president from 2000 to 2006, said the current policy is clearly not working. ""I believe it's time to open the debate over legalizing drugs,"" he told CNN on Tuesday. ""It must be done in conjunction with the United States, but it is time to open the debate."" He pointed to how the end of Prohibition in the United States in 1933 lessened organized crime violence. ""It can't be that the only way is for the state to use force,"" he said.  Watch Fox say it's time to debate legalizing drugs » . Fox was mirroring a position adopted earlier this year by his predecessor as president of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, and the former heads of Colombia and Brazil. The three former chief executives are members of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy. At a February meeting in Brazil, the commission called for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in tactics in the war on drugs. ""The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,"" former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said at a news conference in which the 17-member commission's recommendations were presented. Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because ""you have to start somewhere."" Zedillo was president of Mexico from 1994 to 2000. Gaviria was president of Colombia from 1990 to 1994. And Cardoso led Brazil from 1995 to 2002. Fox said any change in drug laws must be accompanied by an education campaign in schools and homes. And because the United States is a large consumer of marijuana that comes from Latin America, any steps toward legalization must be supported in Washington, he said. Gaviria said in February that the time is right to start a debate on the subject, particularly with the pragmatic openings provided by the election of President Obama. ""In many states in the United States, as is the case in California, they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes. And in Washington there's some consensus that the current policy is failing,"" Gaviria said. The call for a change in strategy comes amid a horrific explosion of drug-related violence in Mexico, where officials say 10,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006. Calderon said in a speech earlier this year that 6,500 of those deaths occurred in 2008. Calderon, who succeeded Fox, ramped up the battle against the nation's narcotics traffickers and brought in the army to reinforce often ineffective local and state police. That was a change in tactics from Fox, who said he had chosen to strengthen federal police and intelligence-gathering operations and to create a secretary for public security. But now that Calderon has chosen a different approach, he must prevail, Fox said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""If you go to war, you have to win it quickly and according to regulations,"" he said. ""Human rights are very important."" It also is important that the United States ""accept its responsibility,"" he said. ""I would like to see some steps taken here in the United States. We see the drugs are coming across the border and are distributed in Atlanta and Washington and Chicago and all parts of the country."" Fox's comparison of the current battle to Prohibition in the United States in the 1920s was recently touted by Robert Pastor, who was a Latin America national security adviser for President Carter in the late 1970s. He called the problem in Mexico ""even worse than Chicago during the Prohibition era."" Pastor said a solution similar to what ended that violence is needed now. ""What worked in the U.S. was not Eliot Ness,"" he said, referring to the federal agent famous for fighting gangsters in the 1920s and 19'30s. ""It was the repeal of Prohibition."" Others are not so sure. ""This has become a world of globalization,"" said Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, Mexico's executive secretary for the National System for Public Safety. ""Globalization has many virtues but some errors. I can't conceive that one part of the world would decriminalize drugs because it would become a paradise for drug use. It might bring down violence, but there would be social damage.""","Changes in drug policy must be done in conjunction with the U.S., Vicente Fox says .

"(CNNGo) -- Thai Airways International is catching heat for imposing weight restrictions on its 6,000 flight attendants. Those who don't shape up face the risk of being kept out of the sky. According to a story in the Bangkok Post, flight attendants who don't meet the airline's body mass index and waistline controls, imposed last year, have been limited to service on domestic and same-day-return flights. If they don't comply after a year, they will be transferred to ground services. The 41 flight attendants affected -- 28 of them male -- recently complained to the Labour Protection and Welfare Department that the regulation violated their human rights and decreased their incomes. They were told the regulation is not illegal and falls within the authority of management, which was concerned about customer service. Earlier this year, female Thai Airways flight attendants over the age of 45 were given the option of early retirement through a buyout package instituted as part of the airline's drive to rejuvenate its image and save costs.

"(CNN) -- A Nevada city councilwoman who faced possible sanctions over a travel expense voucher and public comments was found dead with her husband Tuesday, hours before a City Council meeting that had the issues involving her on its agenda, officials said. Donna Fairchild and Bill Fairchild were found in a residence in the city of Mesquite, Nevada, on Interstate 15 near the border with Arizona, authorities said. Police got a call from the residence about 4:30 a.m. Each apparently suffered a single gunshot wound, the city said. Autopsies are scheduled for Wednesday. Results from the Clark County Coroner's Office were expected to take four to six weeks, according to a statement from the city. Mesquite city spokesman Bryan Dangerfield would not comment on the circumstances of their deaths but said police confirmed that a note and a 9 mm handgun were found at the scene. ""The content of the note will not be disclosed until the investigation is complete,"" Dangerfield said. City Manager Timothy Hacker said he believed that Donna Fairchild was concerned about the agenda items, according to CNN Las Vegas affiliate KLAS. The City Council was required to meet Tuesday night, but in light of the day's events, Dangerfield said the allegations against Fairchild probably would not be debated. Two prayers were offered by pastors during the meeting, he said. Fairchild, who was a candidate for mayor, told the Desert Valley Times last week that she would not comment on the allegations against her, but instead would talk about them Tuesday night. Mayor Susan Holecheck and City Attorney Cheryl Truman Hunt had planned to ask the City Council to consider sanctioning Fairchild through possible reprimand, removal from boards or expulsion for filing a $94.60 mileage reimbursement request with the city for a January 4 Nevada Development Authority board meeting she allegedly did not attend, according to an item on the council agenda. Fairchild allegedly violated the city's code of conduct and its personnel policy, and allegedly fraudulently presented a claim to a public officer, Hunt wrote in a January 18 memo. Holecheck, who is seeking re-election, and Hunt also wanted the City Council to consider removing Fairchild as the city's representative to the Nevada Development Authority board of directors. According to a filing on the agenda, comments Fairchild made about the development authority in a newspaper article ""were negative towards this agency, and deemed incompatible with the mission of the agency and good working relations with other NDA board members."" A January 7 article of the Desert Valley Times includes interviews and comments from Mesquite mayoral candidates. In the article, Fairview said, ""We just got a bill from the Nevada Development Authority: It costs $7,500 to belong. There was one thing that came out of the NDA, and that was Do It Best. That was huge for the community, but I don't think we're getting the bang for our buck."" In the article, Fairchild said that Mesquite should be doing most of its own marketing. NDA Executive Director Somer Hollingsworth wrote Holecheck that Fairchild -- who was the city's representative to the board since July 2009 -- should have brought her concerns to him, rather than airing them publicly, especially since she was a member of the NDA executive committee, according to an e-mail attached with the filing. According to the agenda item, Fairchild could have discussed her issues with the NDA if she had attended the January 4 board meeting. Messages seeking comment were left with Holecheck and Hunt on Tuesday. A statement from the mayor's office and City Council said, ""It is with a heavy heart that we make this announcement. Mesquite has lost two citizens that have devoted their life to public service. On behalf of myself and the City Council, this is a tremendous loss to our community and we express our deepest sympathies to the Fairchilds' family, loved ones and friends."" Donna Fairchild served on the City Council from 2001 to 2007 and was re-elected in 2009. She moved to Mesquite with Bill Fairchild in 1999 after they both retired from the Denver Police Department, the city said. Donna Fairchild also has been an EMT/paramedic and news reporter for KIMN/KYGO radio in Denver. In Mesquite, Bill worked at a recreation center and was a member of the Virgin Valley Honor Guard and the Veterans of Foreign War. The Fairchilds were married for 21 years, the city said. CNN's Melanie Whitley and Frances Causey contributed to this report.","Councilwoman Donna Fairchild faced possible sanctions .

"(CNN) -- Martin Kaymer has claimed golf's No. 1 ranking after reaching the final of the World Match Play tournament in Arizona on Saturday. The German toppled Englishman Lee Westwood as he first beat Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez in the quarterfinals and then ended the hopes of American Bubba Watson. The 26-year-old will face European Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald in Sunday's final at Dove Mountain's Ritz-Carlton course after the Englishman made light work of his matches against Americans Ryan Moore and Matt Kuchar. ""It has taken me only five years to get to number one. For myself, my family and the people I work with, it's a great achievement,"" Kaymer told reporters. ""I was not thinking about the number one spot as I was sure I would get the opportunity again over the next few weeks, I just wanted to win the match. ""Luke is probably one of the best match-play players in the world. We get along well, but because it's a final it will add more pressure."" Westwood had been top of the rankings since the end of October, when he ended Tiger Woods' record reign, but he lost in the second round of the $8.5 million tournament. European Tour No. 1 Kaymer won both of his matches at the 18th, surviving a late rally from Jimenez after leading by four holes at 14. Kaymer closes on golf's top spot . Jimenez -- at 47 the oldest man in the initial 64-strong field -- reduced the gap to one as Kaymer lost his accuracy, but then failed to find the green in regulation at the last. Kaymer was pegged back three times by Watson -- who earlier beat compatriot J.B. Holmes at the first extra hole of their quarterfinal -- but won 15 and 16 before the left-hander birdied 17. Watson struggled to find the green at 18, and Kaymer sank an eight-foot par putt to seal victory. Sunday's opponent Donald can climb to third in the world rankings with victory in the final, which would end his five-year title title drought in U.S. events and earn him $1.4 million. Westwood and Mickelson crash out of Match Play . The 33-year-old opened the day in fine style with a 5 & 4 win over Moore as he led from the first green, and won three holes in a row from the eighth before his fifth birdie of the match at 14 sealed it. Donald then thrashed U.S. Ryder Cup player and 2010 PGA Tour money list champion Kuchar 6 & 5 in the first semifinal to be completed. He fired six birdies in 13 holes in increasingly windy conditions at Dove Mountain's Ritz-Carlton course. Kuchar earlier eliminated 2009 PGA Championship winner Y.E. Yang, defeating the 39-year-old Korean 2 & 1 in the quarterfinals. Woods follows Poulter out of WGC-Match Play championship . Yang, who beat U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell on Friday, was never ahead in the match and trailed by four holes after the eighth, then Kuchar matched his four consecutive pars to 17. Watson came from 5-down after 10 holes to beat Holmes at the 19th hole, which his compatriot bogeyed to go behind for the first time in the match. The semifinals were originally scheduled for Sunday, but warnings of adverse weather meant they were brought forward. Organizers hope the final will not be disrupted by the forecast drop in temperatures which could bring snow to the desert course.","Martin Kaymer ends Lee Westwood's reign at the top of the world golf rankings .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki has regained the women's world number one ranking from Belgium's Kim Clijsters, after beating Shahar Peer to reach the semifinals of the Dubai Tennis Championships on Friday. The Dane eased past the ninth seed 6-2 6-4, and will now replace Australian Open champion Clijsters when the new WTA rankings are published on Monday. Clijsters, who skipped the hard-court event in the United Arab Emirates, will have held the number one ranking for just seven days. The 27-year-old rose to the top spot again -- having first done so in 2003 --when she reached the last four of the Paris Open, but left Wozniacki with a chance to reclaim the position when she lost to Petra Kvitova in the final. CNN Blog: Can Murray become a grand slam champion? The 20-year-old Wozniacki will now remain at the top of the rankings at least until after the U.S. tournament in Indian Wells which starts on March 23. However, the 2009 U.S. Open finalist -- who is yet to win a grand slam title -- insisted winning tournaments is more important to her than being No. 1. ""I've said all along I wasn't sure about whether I could become number one this week, and that my focus really is not upon that,"" she told reporters. ""For the moment it's more important to concentrate on what I have to do and try to win the tournament."" Her achievement was marked in a much more low-key fashion then when she became the 20th woman in history to reach the summit in October last year. Due to fears over the safety of Peer -- who became the first woman from Israel to play in the Arab state in 2010 -- the match was played on a remote outside court with few spectators and heavy security, where there were no on-court celebrations. Next up for Wozniacki will be Serbian former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic, who defeated Australian fourth seed Sam Stosur of Australia in three closely-contested sets. Sixth seed Jankovic eventually triumphed 6-3 5-7 7-6 (7-4) against world No. 5 and French Open runner-up Stosur. In the other half of the draw, two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia beat Polish eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska 7-6 (9-7) 6-3 in the penultimate quarterfinal. The Russian will next face Italian 11th seed Flavia Pennetta, who thrashed Russia's Alisa Kleybanova 6-2 6-0 in the late match. Elsewhere, at the men's Marseille Open, Swedish top seed and world No. 4 Robin Soderling progressed to the semifinals with an easy straight-sets win over France's Michael Llodra. The two-time French Open finalist came through 6-1 6-4, and will next play Dmitry Tursunov after the Russian defeated Austrian fourth seed Jurgen Melzer 6-4 2-6 6-1 in Friday's closing match. In the other half of the draw of the ATP World Tour hard-court tournament, world No. 7 and Wimbledon runner-up Tomas Berdych was knocked out by Croatia's Marin Cilic. The former world number nine swept aside his Czech opponent 6-3 6-4 to book his place in the semifinals of the French event, where he will face third seed Mikhail Youzhny. The Russian ended home hopes with a 6-4 2-6 6-4 win over sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.","Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki is set to replace Kim Clijsters as world No. 1 .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's government will invest $1 billion to combat a three month drought crippling the country's north. The worst drought in six decades threatens to ruin China's winter harvest, the world's largest producer of wheat. To combat it, China's government plans to spend around 6.7 billion yuan ($1.02 billion) to divert water to affected areas and irrigation facilities according to the state news agency, Xinhua. Some 2.57 million people and 2.79 million livestock are suffering from drinking water shortages, Xinhua said. The main affected provinces include Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei and Shanxi, which together account for about 60% of the wheat planted this winter. The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued an alert Tuesday, warning of severe wheat shortages, saying ""the ongoing drought is potentially a serious problem."" According to the FAO the drought is now affecting an area of around 5.16 million hectares, representing two-thirds of China's wheat production. Meanwhile the country's capital Beijing got it first snowfall in more than three months overnight on Wednesday. But the precipitation is unlikely to end the area's drought, reported Xinhua. The precipitation followed cloud seeding by the municipal artificial weather intervention office, the agency said.","NEW: The government invests $1 billion to combat the drought .
