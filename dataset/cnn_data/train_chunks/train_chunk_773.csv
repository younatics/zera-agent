"By . Bianca London . With the sports luxe trend showing no sign of abating, designers have found a way of reinventing the style for another season. The likes of Jeremy Scott and Adidas are hot-footing a new trend for sporty fashion in the form of a high heeled trainer. The bizarre footwear is even being championed by renowned style icon Anna Dello Russo - so are we all going to be wearing the kooky style next season? Scroll down for video . Hot new trend? Anna Dello Russo, known for being fashion-forward, gives Jeremy Scott and Adidas' heeled trainers their first outing at Paris Fashion Week . Trainers have been the . footwear staple this season, just one look down at the feet of . front-row goers and New Balances are everywhere. But the trend for functional footwear has been given a more feminine makeover with the help of a few inches. Would YOU wear them? Clearly giving the sports luxe trend an update, fashionistas in Paris are hoping the stiletto trainer will catch on . Celebrity stylist Alex Longmore helped shed some light on the trend: 'You could say that this bizarre design is just a continuation of the trend for wedged trainers. 'Isabel Marant was the first to put the heel into the trainer and now Nike and high street brands have followed suit. 'Jared Leto described Scott as ""a creative genius"" but I am not so sure I agree, I think these are tacky, look extraordinarily uncomfortable and should be reserved for younger stars such as Cara Delevingne and Rihanna who have the only chance of carrying this look off.' Quirky: Jeremy Scott and Adidas already have some questionable footwear on offer . Thomas Merrigan, Menswear Writer at . OxbloodAndWolf.Wordpress.com, added: 'Jeremy Scott never fails to push . the boundaries of cringeworthy with his garments. These are no exceptions . to that rule. 'The trend of adapted high heel trainers like this started years ago with counterfeit Air Jordan pairs. 'They are ugly as sin and this is exactly what Jeremy Scott thrives on for his ever eccentric, yet pop-cultured, shock factor.' Remember these? Timberland gave heeled boots a spin a few years ago and they didn't exactly catch on . Continuing the theme for giving a hint of height to an otherwise usually flat shoe Mui Mui models wore wellies with a sturdy looking heel on the catwalk today. The transparent shoes came in green and blue versions and were shown as part of the designers ready to wear fall/winter 2014-2015 collection.

"By . Ruth Styles . Natalie Portman has revealed that she loves being a mother and has learned to be less judgmental in the years following the birth of her son Aleph, two. In a rare interview, given to the Telegraph, the actress, 32, also spoke of inadvertently punching Thor co-star Tom Hiddleston in the face during a fight scene and of her new career behind the camera as she prepares to direct her first film, A Tale Of Love And Darkness, based on a memoir by Israeli author Amos Oz. Jerusalem-born Portman, who also wrote the screenplay, added: 'It is his coming-of-age story set during the creation of the state of Israel.' Mother's pride: Natalie Portman pictured enjoying a day out in Paris with her two-year-old son Aleph . Leading lady: Portman with her husband Benjamin Millepied and co-star Tom Hiddleston at the Thor premiere . The actress, who is currently renting a house in Tel Aviv with her son and husband Benjamin Millipied, describes the experience as 'exciting and scary' and says she finds living in Israel 'fascinating'. But it is her son who occupies much of her time, with the actress confessing that she's had to accept that parenting is an individual endeavour with no real rules of engagement. 'I love being a mum,' Portman said. 'I'm less judgmental than before I had a kid. The biggest thing about parenting is that it is a totally different experience for every person. 'Everything is cool, there are no rules - I mean, apart from not hurting your kid. Some people breastfeed until their babies are five, and some don't breastfeed at all. Fame: Portman waves to fans outside the Thor: The Dark World premiere in Paris last week . Love interest: Portman plays astrophysicist Jane Foster opposite Chris Hemsworth's celestial romantic . 'There are no rules about what it means to be a feminist, or a good mother. For some, it's going to be right to go back to work, for others it's going to be right to stop working completely.' Portman is notoriously reticent when it comes to discussing her private life but shows no such qualms when discussing her career - and her penchant for learning. She famously gave up acting at the peak of her Star Wars fame (she played PadmÃ© Amidala) in 1999 to pursue a degree in psychology at Harvard, saying at the time: 'I'd rather be smart than be a movie star'. Since completing her degree, she has managed to be both, combining difficult roles such as that of demented ballet dancer Nina in 2011 film Black Swan with more cerebral pursuits. Career change: Portman's next move will be into directing with new film A Tale Of Love And Darkness . More recently, she has taken roles in more traditional Hollywood blockbusters, including her latest effort, Thor: The Dark World, in which she plays astrophysicist Jane Foster, the love interest of Chris Hemsworth's hammer-wielding god Thor. The chance to portray a tough female character in a blockbuster proved too much to resist, according to Portman, who also revealed that her favourite part of the on-set experience involved punching Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in the face. 'He acted like he could handle it but I think it actually hurt him!'","The actress, 32, made the remarks during a rare interview .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Fourteen men were charged with operating an online child exploitation network that investigators said preyed upon hundreds of boys across the United States and overseas, authorities announced Tuesday. Law enforcement officials said the arrests were part of a worrisome trend in which children are being enticed into posting sexually explicit images of themselves. Those images are then broadly shared online. In this case, authorities said users of an underground network posed online as girls to coerce boys into sharing with them child pornography images. 'These alleged perpetrators preyed upon the most innocent, most vulnerable members of our society with no regard to the immediate or lasting harm they caused to their victims and their families,' Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said. Scroll down for video . Sting: British police are poised to make arrests after one of the worst ever child pornography rings was uncovered in the U.S. Fourteen men were arrested after more than 250 children, mostly boys were found to be victims. U.S. officials identified 27-year-old Jonathan Johnson (pictured) as the the main administer of the site . Big win: Officials with customs and homeland security announced the major sting in a press conference held Tuesday . Predators: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the fourteen men arrested preyed upon 'the most innocent, most vulnerable members of our society' The investigation was led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. The 250 victims were spread across 39 states and five other countries â€” Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Most were boys (159) between 13 and 15. Seven were 9 years and younger and two were 3 or younger, authorities said. The images and videos were shared on an underground website on the Tor network, an online anonymity network that masks the location of servers and conceals an Internet user's location. The subscription-based website operated from about June 2012 until June 2013 and had more than 27,000 members, authorities said. All of the victims have been contacted by law enforcement officials and the U.S. victims have been offered the assistance of HSI victim assistance specialists.

There are still some 300 ongoing investigations into the website's subscribers. Eleven of the 14 men, including the man authorities say was the administrator of the network, are being prosecuted in Louisiana. The other three are being charged in New York, Colorado and Wisconsin. Authorities accuse Jonathan Johnson of of Abita Springs, Louisiana, of being the leader of the operation. They said he admitted creating multiple fake female personas from his home and encouraged others to do the same in an effort to entice boys to produce sexually explicit images of themselves. Court papers show Johnson was charged last month through a criminal information, a document that can only be filed with a defendant's consent. It signals a guilty plea. He faces 20 years to life in prison. A lawyer for Johnson did not immediately return a call seeking comment on Tuesday. Jonathan Johnson, 27 . Albita Springs, Louisiana . Daniel Nolan Devor, 39 .

"By . Katy Winter . Told she had just five years to live because of her enormous 45st bulk, a morbidly obese young woman has overcome the to odds to shed almost half of her body weight. Christina Phillips, 22, from South Haven, Mississippi, weighed 639lb or 45st 7lb, and was barely able to walk when she underwent dangerous bypass surgery in bid to save her life. And despite a litany of complications, including overcoming food addiction, Christina has managed to shed 19st and reclaim her independence. Scroll down for video . Miserable: Despite being just 22 years old, Christina was forced to live an isolated life because of her weight . Her new life is a far cry from her previous existence, which saw her leading an isolated life at home because of her weight. So large had Christina become, she wasn't even able to cook for herself, leaving her dependent on her mother and husband Zach for even the most basic needs. ‘I never thought I would get this big,' she confesses. 'I was always home, rarely did I get out. I was trapped inside this body that I didn’t want to be in. She added: ‘Just simply walking from the living room to the kitchen was hard and I felt like my knees are going to collapse. I couldn’t even drive anymore.' Dependent: Confined to the couch or her bed, Christina was forced to rely on her mother and husband . Unable to move more than a few metres and with multiple health problems, her mother Tammie and her husband, Zach were forced to bath and cook for her, and even helped her to dress - much to Christina's humiliation. ‘When I was about 18 I started getting these tumour-like masses on my legs,' she explains. 'It disgusts me to look at my legs. ‘When the lymphedema came on that was the turning point; that was when things got really bad. After I got married my weight went up by 300lb. It was out of control and I’m too young to be living like this. Speaking on TLC show My 600lb Life ahead of her life-saving gastric surgery, she added: 'I’m only 22 - I don’t want to die. 'I haven’t even had the chance to experience life yet.  I just sit at home on my laptop or watching TV, and eating all day. ‘My fear is I will just keep getting bigger and bigger until I die and my heart stops. It is terrifying.' Action: Christina travelled to a specialist hospital in Texas for the weight loss surgery she needed . Couple: Christina with her husband Zach who, according to doctors, enabled her to get bigger . Christina's problems began in early childhood and by the time she was 12, she already tipped the scales at a whopping 21st. ‘I . have always been bigger,' she reveals. 'In the seventh grade I was close to 300lb.' Speaking about the reasons for her weight gain, she reveals: 'My . parents used to fight a lot when I was younger. It was scary. I think . that might be part of the reason I turned to food. ‘When . I was 17 I stepped on the scale and I was close to 400lb and I just . couldn’t believe it. I never thought I would weigh that much. ‘I . was oldest of all my siblings and all the fighting, shouting . and yelling made me feel like it was my job to protect my brother and . my sister.' Terrifying: Christina was warned that she could be dead in five years if she failed to lose weight . Her weight problem worsened after she met her husband Zach and piled on another 300lb after the wedding. Nevertheless, he explains, Christina's weight has never bothered him - even though she weighed 28st when they first met. ‘Her . weight never bothered me,' he reveals. She’s smart, pretty; you . couldn’t ask for anyone better. It was love at first sight. ‘If . she wants something I go out and get it for her because I love her and . she asks for it. I mean I’m scared to death of losing her but at the . same time I don’t want to make her mad.' Now, with her health failing and her life made miserable, Christina has turned to gastric surgery in a bid to lose the weight. Painful: Christina chats to her mother Tammie following her successful gastric bypass surgery . Much better: Christina was housebound and covered in lumps but is now slimmer and much healthier . Admitted to the hospital, she was put on a 1,000 calorie a day diet  and underwent gastric bypass surgery, leaving the the hospital days later. A year after surgery, Christina has shed 266lbs and is able to sleep in the same bed as her husband for the first time in years. 'I used to hide from the world but now I can’t wait to get out there,' she reveals. 'My relationship with food has changed completely, it’s much better. 'I’m not tempted by foods I used to be able to eat. My family are eating better and helping me make the right choices with what I eat.' With her lymphedemas and 600lb life a thing of the past, Christina has also started exploring the possibility of attending the local college. ‘One of my dreams has always been to get a job as a nurse and I can finally see myself making that a reality,' she says. 'I’m getting closer to all of my goals.' Christina appears on My 600lb Life, tonight at 9pm on TLC .","Christina Phillips, 22, weighed 28st by the time she was 17 .

"By . Ruth Styles . She may be a professional rider and former Olympian, but sporty Zara Phillips has no intention of being a hands-off mother. Despite telling Australian magazine Womanâ€™s Weekly that her pregnancy came as a complete 'shock', Zara, who gave birth this morning in the Gloucestershire Royal NHS hospital, has been quietly preparing for motherhood. Now she has left hospital, having stayed just a few hours, finding a nanny will be among her immediate plans, because the Olympic silver medallist hopes to pick up her eventing career where she left off. Zara gave birth to a baby girl this morning, but has already left the hospital as she and former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, can begin their new life as parents . The Queen's granddaughter, pictured here with Mike, is likely to raise her daughter with the same passion for horses and country pursuits that both her and her husband so love . The arrangement is similar to one employed by Zara's own mother, Princess Anne, herself a keen horsewoman. Her two children, Zara and Peter Phillips, were cared for by their nanny Sarah Minty while she and ex-husband, Captain Mark Phillips, pursued hugely successful careers in showjumping. But although Zara remains committed to eventing, the famously down-to-earth royal is unlikely to be a distant figure in the life of her daughter, and is instead likely to ensure her new daughter enjoys a classic country childhood, complete with ponies and plenty of pets. Princess Anne, pictured with children Peter and Zara, is also a keen horsewoman and employed a nanny to help her juggle her riding with raising the young royals . Like most of the Royal Family, Zara was raised to love the outdoors and traditional country pursuits . The Olympic silver-medalist has been riding since infancy, pictured here riding Shetland pony 'Smoky' in 1984 . She also plans to cook for the new baby, and has used her enforced career-break to brush up on her culinary skills. In the same interview with Australian Woman's Weekly, the sportswoman added: 'I have been a bit bored. I'm used to being on the go and active the whole time, and now it's quite different. So, yes, I'm baking. I love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby.' New father Tindall added of her culinary skills: 'She's a very good cook and cooks me everything. I cook too, but I'm the pudding guy - sticky toffee puddings, chocolate fondants and brownies. 'I'm very good at following a recipe whereas Zara's good at putting her own twist on things.' Professional equestrian Zara is likely to ensure that her new daughter enjoys a classic country childhood complete with ponies and plenty of pets. Tindall, a former England rugby captain who comes from a solidly middle class background, is likely to insist on a down-to-earth upbringing for his daughter, and, like his wife, loves spending time outdoors. The new arrival is sure to follow suit, and will certainly have plenty of space to run about in: her parents recently relocated to a cottage on Princess Anne's spacious 730-acre Gatcombe Estate in Gloucestershire. The Gatcombe estate certainly will provide ample room for baby Tindall to play . The baby's grandmother Princess Anne will play a large role in her upbringing as Mike and Zara have moved into a cottage on the Gatcombe Estate . Baby Tindall may attend Zara and Prince Charles' former school Gordonstoun in Moray, Scotland . The move also means Zara can spend . more time with her new daughter, because the property also houses Zara's . horses and is where she trains both her racehorses and her three-day . eventers. Zara competing at the European Equestrian Championship in Italy. She has spoken about her desire to get back on a horse as soon as possible after giving birth . It . will also mean a bigger role for Princess Anne - already a grandmother to Peter and Autumn Phillips' children Savannah and Isla - who will . be on-hand to dispense advice to her daughter and provide a spare pair . of hands. The baby's other . grandparents are Tindall's mother Linda, who is a social worker, and his . father Philip, a retired bank official who played rugby for Otley for . 10 years until a knee injury ended his career in 1973. Both are likely to want to play a big role in the new Miss Tindall's upbringing and are already regular visitors to the Gatcombe Estate. And while the new baby will, like her mother, forego a royal title, she is likely to have an education fit for a princess. Zara herself followed in her uncle Prince Charles' footsteps and was educated at Gordonstoun in Moray, Scotland, a possible destination for the new arrival. Regardless of education, the newest addition to the royal family will certainly spend plenty of time with her blue-blooded relatives, and will join the rest of the family at Sandringham next Christmas. And although her cousin Prince George will be spending the next few months in Australia and New Zealand, the two newest members of the royal family are likely to meet long before that. Baby Tindall's cousin Prince George will head off to Australia on tour with his parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge soon, but the newest members of the Royal family will no doubt meet before he leaves .","Zara gave birth to a daughter this morning and has already left hospital .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A boy aged 14 today became one of Britain’s youngest ever degree students when he started his first day at university. Brainbox Wajih Ahmed, from Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, officially enrolled on an economics degree at the University of Southampton. He picked up his new student ID before heading off to an introductory lecture as the youngest ever student at the university. Brainbox: Wajih Ahmed, 14, became one of Britain's youngest ever degree students today when he started at Southampton University . Incredibly Wajih isn't the only genius in the family - his brother Zohaib achieved his second A-level in maths aged just ten. But it is Wajih who is taking the first steps into Higher Education. He is aiming for a first class honours degree to add to his already impressive haul of 15 GCSEs and four A-levels. He will also attend trials for the university’s football and badminton teams - competing against people more than four years older than him. Wajih is already making waves among his new peers, with one fellow student calling him a 'legend' upon meeting the child prodigy. Earlier this month Xavier Gordon-Brown became Britain's youngest student to embark on a degree aged 12. The prodigy began a maths degree with the Open University but will be accompanied to lectures by his mum. Xavier achieved an A* in maths aged just 8. Prodigy: Wajih already has 15 GCSEs and four A-levels including A*s in maths and further maths . Wajih will continue to live at his . home, which is just four miles from the university campus, with his mum . Saadia and dad Usman for the duration of the three year course. Mrs Ahmed, 40, said: 'I can’t wait for the day when we go to see him pick up his degree, it will be amazing. 'I’m sure seeing him graduate will be just as emotional as the day we picked up his first GCSE.' Mr Ahmed said: 'I cannot find the words to express my pride.' Wajih scored an impressive 100 per cent in his A-level physics and 93 per cent in his AS-level economics. He has been awarded A*s in A-level maths, further maths and an A in A-level chemistry. He got an A* in maths GCSE at the tender age of nine and since then he’s picked up A*s in GCSE statistics, physics, chemistry, biology and R.E. If all goes to plan he could have a BSc degree by the age of 17. And Wajih isn't planning to stop there saying he will move on to do a PhD before starting a career as an actuary. Wajih, who lists his hobbies as playing Xbox and football, said it had been a life-long dream of his to start university at the age of 14. 'I’m really excited,' he said. Professor Debra Humphris, Pro Vice-Chancellor of Education at the university, said: 'We are delighted to welcome Wajih.'","Brainbox Wajih Ahmed enrolled on economics degree course .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Focusing on other kids: The judge ordered Scott Studer to pay a donation to Newtown victims even though he is in Ohio . A former Ohio high school basketball coach who pleaded guilty to videotaping boys in a locker room shower for years has been sentenced to 15 years in prison - and must give $5,000 to the Connecticut community where a gunman killed 26 people. Scott Studer plead guilty Wednesday morning to an eight-count indictment. In addition to prison, Judge Frank Forchione in Canton ordered that Studer's fine be directed to Newtown, Connecticut, scene of last week's school shooting rampage. The judge didn't specify the fund that should get the 46-year-old's fine. At least 74 boys have been identified on the secretly recorded videotapes made over the span of eight years at Jackson High School near Canton. The judge ordered the tapes destroyed. They were found by police when they raided the coach's house and found numerous images of naked students. Whenever the opportunity arose, Studer had been placing hidden cameras in the locker room, focused on the shower area. Officers believe that the coach had been doing this for the last seven years. It is unclear whether Mr Studer is married or has children. Studer was arraigned on six felony counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material. Sentencing: Studer was sentenced to 15 years behind bars . Police Chief David Zink and School District Superintendent Chris DiLoreto held a tense press conference with over 50 angry parents. As reported by Cantonrep.com, Zink told the room that he could not give ‘any indication of how many people are in these images’. The chief added that: 'These images, to my knowledge, were not shared with others.’ But disgusted parents now face an deeply uncomfortable wait to see if their children are identified on Studer’s videos. Many parents are angry with how the . situation has been handled by authorities. Mother Vicky Smith, whose son . plays on the freshman basketball team, told Newsnet5 she was upset that the school hadn't contacted parents immediately or provided counseling. 'Figure of trust': Scott D Studer was secretly filming his basketball students while they showered . Angry and disgusted: Parents and law enforcement officials attend the press conference following Scott Studer's arrest for filming students in shower . 'For them, the school, not to have psychologists in there today working with the boys through this, not having contacted the parents of the children, having to hear about it from outside sources, I'm very concerned,' Smith said. Meanwhile, students have taken to social media discuss their anger and betrayal by a long-standing figure of trust. Many boys have recalled how Studer used to make students take a shower, even if they didn’t want to. Other potential victims spoke of odd practices at showertime, such as Studer suggesting snowball fights or playing with a volleyball. This morning, Studer was represented in court by attorney James Haupt . He told Cantonrep.com: ‘At this time we are maintaining his innocence in this particular case. It is too early on to say much.’","Scott Studer, 46, had been videotaping naked students since 2005 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Celebrity chefs such as Heston Blumenthal have been blamed for a surge in deadly chip pan fines. The London Fire Brigade today revealed fires from deep-frying pans increased 14 per cent between 2012 and 2013, and suggested a new trend for authentic 'posh' chips could be behind it. Techniques such as the triple-cooking favoured by Mr Blumenthal are especially dangerous, the brigade suggested, and could have contributed to the hundreds of injuries caused by chip pan fires in recent years. Trend-setter: London Fire Brigade warned that a vogue for 'posh' chips could be putting people in danger . Technique: Mr Blumenthal recommends deep-frying chips twice - which fire experts say heightens the risk . Concentration: A fire brigade spokesman said even a moment's lapse when using deep-fryers can end in disaster . The chef's technique involves boiling the raw potatoes, and cooling them in the freezer before two rounds of deep-frying, to achieve the crispiest texture possible. Firefighter Dave Brown said: 'Many people think that chip pans are a thing of the past, but there's been a recent rise in celebrity chefs endorsing posh chips on TV cooking programmes. 'Chip pans and cooking with hot oil can be really dangerous and the risk increases when you start frying food more than once, as is the current trend with chips. 'All it can take is for you to become distracted for a few seconds and your cooking oil can quickly go up in flames.' Deadly: Chip pan fires, pictured here in fire brigade controlled demonstrations, have killed three people and injured 500 in London in the past five years . Over the past five years, there were 1,754 chip pan fires in London resulting in 500 people being injured and three people being killed. However, the fire brigade stressed that overall fires were down by a quarter. They suggested that people visit their local chip shop, or use the oven, rather than attempting to imitate chefs such as Mr Blumenthal. Firefighters also warned that, if a chip pan does catch fire, it is best not move it, and not try to extinguish it with water - as it will create a huge fireball. Instead, people should call the fire brigade. Representatives for Mr Blumenthal were not available for comment. Perfection: The triple-cooking recipe is said to produce the ultimate chips . To serve four people . Ingredients:1.2 kg potatoes1 litre groundnut oil1 litre rendered fat (dripping, goose or duck) Method . Wash the potatoes and with a sharp kitchen knife square them into rectangles, then cut them into chips about 1 cm thick. As soon as they are cut, put them into a bowl under cold running water for 10 minutes or so to rinse off some of the starch, then drain them. Next, bring a casserole of unsalted water to the boil and plunge in the drained potatoes. Bring back to the boil and simmer gently until the point of a knife will penetrate the chips easily. It is important to make sure the water is only just simmering. If it boils too aggressively the potatoes will begin to break up. Very carefully lift the potatoes out of the water, using  a slotted spoon, and place them on a tray. Allow them to steam cool, then place in the fridge. The chips will harden when cold. For next stage, heat groundnut oil to a temperature of 130C and plunge in the chips. After a while. they will take on a drier appearance (do not let them brown at all). Drain them, let them cool to room temperature, and put them in the fridge. When cold, they are ready for their final cooking. Heat the rendered fat to 180C. Plunge in chips and cook until golden brown. This may take 8-10 minutes; be patient in order to obtain a really crisp chip. Drain and season with salt only; they will take quite a lot.

"By . Mark Prigg . 4G data speeds on mobile devices are dropping at an alarming rate in the US, a new study has warned. In the February 2014 report, the United States ranked 15th of 16 countries for download speeds, as the average data rate dropped to 6.5Mbps from 9.6 megabits per second in the February 2013 report. The authors say US networks 'uniformly perform poorly' for speed - increasing claims the technology has not yet lived up to the hype surrounding its launch. Global speeds: The United States ranked 15th of 16 countries for download speeds, as the average data rate dropped to 6.5Mbps from 9.6 megabits per second in February 2013. To create the graphics, OpenSignal took data from users of its speed testing app, which has 6 million users. It focussed on their experience of two key metrics: download speed, and the proportion of time spent with LTE access. Of the country's major network operators, T-Mobile had the best data rate, at 11.2Mbps. AT&T rated 8.9Mbps, Verizon 7.6Mbps, and Sprint 4.2Mbps. However, Verizon, followed by AT&T, rated much better for coverage. Metro PCS recorded  the slowest speeds of all eligible networks, possibly a result of their small spectrum allocation, which uses a 5MHz band while most US carriers use 20MHz. The data was collected by the OpenSignal app. It warned that operators may be attempting to decieve customers over the speed of 4G. 'Network operators around the world are working hard to convince their users to make the jump to LTE. 'The term '4G' acts as a convenient label for marketers to emphasise the superiority of this new standard over its predecessors. 'We found that not all LTE networks are created equal, indeed there is an extremely broad range of experience across both metrics. 'Only about a quarter of networks surveyed achieve both good coverage and fast speeds; clearly there remains much work before LTE lives up to its full potential.' To create the graphics, OpenSignal took data from those of our 6 million users who have LTE and focussed on their experience of two key metrics: download speed, and the proportion of time spent with LTE access,' the firm said. How did your network do? the report also looked at individual operators - and Metro PCS recorded the slowest speeds of all eligible networks, possibly a result of their small spectrum allocation, which uses a 5MHz band while most US carriers use 20MHz. 'Looking at coverage goes some way towards mitigating the USAâ€™s poor speed performance,' it said. 'The USA performs well on our coverage metric, with the average user experiencing LTE coverage 67% of the time, with Australia, the fastest country, on 58%. OpenSignal said speeds tended to drop as a carrier takes on more users. 'This is the reason that some countries have improved since our last report a year ago, while others have worsened,' it said . Most of the country averages have stayed broadly the same, with only minor improvement or deterioration in service. Australia and Japan have made the biggest improvements, with Australiaâ€™s average speeds increasing 42% to 24.5Mbps and Japan improving 66% to 11.8Mbps. The USA suffers the biggest decline, with average speeds falling 32% to 6.5 Mbps, the second slowest global average.","US average data rate dropped to 6.5Mbps from 9.6 megabits over last year .

Being saved: The six-man crew were on their boat which was 11 miles south-east of The Lizard in Cornwall . A Royal Navy offshore patrol ship, HMS Tyne, was also despatched because it had bigger pumps. But an hour after the arrival of rescuers the decision was taken to abandon the vessel which was carrying limestone. Alex Greig, Falmouth Coastguard Watch Manager, said the crew were taken on board a lifeboat and were in good health apart from a few cuts and grazes. He said: ‘We received the mayday broadcast from the Sea Breeze at 7am and were able to get lifeboats and the helicopter on scene quickly, along with other vessels that were in the vicinity.

Instead, this is day three of Crufts 2014, where the great, the good, and the downright bizarre of the canine world gather to indulge their passion for pets. From poodles with pigtails, to a pomeranian in a pram, day three of the event at the NEC arena in Birmingham has already seen some incredible sights. Pampered: With pigtails in their hair and a dedicated owner giving a final haircut and applying hairspray, these two poodles are given celebrity-style treatment . Perfect: With their gleaming white fur, dainty bows and sparkling eyes, these two Maltese dogs America (left) and Raphael are sure to impress . Grumpy: As Carter the Bichon Frise has his Afro trimmed on the third day of the show, he looks a little less than impressed with the attention he's getting . Crufts, which started in the Victorian era in 1891, is said to be the largest event of its kind anywhere in the world and attracts the beautiful and the bizarre . Pram: Rather than risk spoiling the coats on these dogs on the way in, their owners have instead opted to put them in specially designed baby buggies . Ready for a closeup: This Shih Tzu waits patiently while his owner styles his hair ready for his time to shine and a chance to be named Best In Show . Today it is the turn of the Toy group of dogs to take centre stage, with breeds such as Chihuahuas, Shih Tzus and Yorkshire Terriers all on display. The day's events will also feature Utility dogs - breeds which don't fit into any other category or whose original use has become redundant. The four-day event is the world's largest dog show, and today features competitions from 9am until 5.15pm. Categories include agility, freestyle and heelwork to music. There will also be various displays from groups including the the West Midlands Police and the East Anglian Staffordshire Bull Terriers. How do I look?: A Yorkshire Terrier, part of the Toy dog category, has its fur styled ready for an appearance on the big stage . Today it is the turn of the Toy and Utility dogs to take centre stage, with the Gundogs to follow on the final day tomorrow . Does this fur make me look fat? This tiny canine is all puffed out after an extensive styling session by his owners at the NEC arena . Cheer up!: All the waiting around seems to have got the better of this poor pooch who looks thoroughly fed up . Thirsty work: This pampered pet proves that its not easy being beautiful as he takes a quick drinks break . Patience: The dog will compete in events such as the Obedience category, which sees them follow on their owners heels and lie down for two minutes . Thursday saw the Working and Pastrol dogs strut their stuff, yesterday featured the Terrier and Hound categories and tomorrow will mark the finale of the competition with the Gundogs - featuring breeds such as Labrador Retrievers, Irish Setters and Springer Spaniels. There are also a number of events solely for children and their dogs . It has changed in ways that couldnâ€™t possibly have been imagined when the show was set up in Victorian times by the late Charles Cruft. Although it was a very different event in 1891 Charles Cruft was a great showman and would surely have enjoyed the size and scope of the event today, which is an essential date in any dog loverâ€™s calendar. Star quality: The dogs get celebrity treatment for the day, and also celebrity attention, as Ulrika Jonsson arrived to give bulldogs Mable and Ted a hug . Flying the flag: If the judges were giving out points for patriotism then this British bulldog would surely walk away with first prize . Ab fab: This tiny chihuahua, called Queenie, is the centre of attention as she arrives with owners Kelly Pearce (left) and Josie Carter . A whole lotta love: The gaze on this man's face shows nothing but love for his two chihuahuas as he sits with them during Crufts . Dog tired: Spending the whole day as the centre of attention and having your hair done can be exhausting, as this Yorkshire terrier seems to be finding out . Upstaged: While the attention is supposed to be on the dogs, this flamboyant owner manages to upstage her poodle with her pink hair, suede and trainers combo . Bad hair day?: Caught halfway through preparations for the show this dog makes for quite a striking sight but will hopefully have the mop-top under control soon . The dog show is still an important part of the event, celebrating the unique relationship that dogs share with their owners. Judges are trained to ensure that only healthy dogs win prizes, which in turn encourages the breeding of healthy dogs. But the event is now about so much more besides. Crufts is ultimately a celebration of all dogs. It celebrates working dogs, such as those in the Gamekeeper classes or which line up for the Police Dog Team Operational and Humanitarian Action of the Year award. It hails hero dogs through the Friends for Life competition. Rescue dogs are celebrated in the rescue dog agility competition and the speed and agility of dogs is celebrated in the ever popular competitions of Flyball and Heelwork to Music. International: Dog owners travel from across the globe to take part in the four-day extravaganza including Laura Donzelli (left), Claudia Madel (centre), and Clara Valtulini (right) from Italy . Picture perfect: This pair of pomeranians, DD and Daisy, have travelled with their owner Sylvia Pope from Shropshire for the day .

Smith went outside shirtless to yell at the crew to leave, exposing a life-sized tattoo of a gun he had on his stomach. Armed police surrounded Maine resident Michael Smith's house Tuesday morning after a life-size gun tattoo on his waistband was mistaken for an actual weapon. Smith was not charged in the misunderstanding . The workers mistook it for an actual weapon, and notified authorities to the home located off Ward Hill Road. Smith was not charged and said the tattoo has never been a problem before. Smith has multiple tattoos, including several covering his left arm. 'Obviously it was a misunderstanding and he didn't have a weapon, but we had to respond to the initial report as if he did,' Maine State police trooper Scott Duff told the Morning Sentinel. Smith, who works nights, said it sounded like someone was driving up his driveway and crushing a thick layer of ice on it. He went outside to tell the crew to leave his property, and they told him no problem. But one worker said he thought he noticed a pistol in Smith's waistband.

"By . Ryan Gorman . A father still grieving over the death of his daughter last year in a car accident received a letter addressed to ‘daughter killed in car crash.’ Mike Seay, of suburban Chicago, received the shocking letter Thursday from OfficeMax. The insensitive addressee was on the second line, under his name. Daughter Ashley Seay, 17, died along with a friend when she lost control of her SUV last April and it slammed into a tree, according to NBC Chicago. Horrifying: Mike Seay received this letter addressed to 'daughter killed in car crash' The devastated father told the station he thinks about his daughter ’10,000 times a day,’ and wanted to know why the office supply chain had such personal information. ‘Why would they have that type of information? Why would they need that?’ He asked. ‘What purpose does it serve anybody to know that? And how much other types of other information do they have if they have that on me, or anyone else? And how do they use that, what do they use that for?’ Mr Seay debated on Facebook about to handle it before calling the OfficeMax call center, they disregarded his complaint. Still grieving: Mr Seay said he still thinks about his daughter 10,000 times a day . Tragedy: Ashley Seay, 17, died last April when she lost control of her SUV and hit a tree . All that was left: The SUV was barely recognizable . ‘The manager [said] that it was impossible, that this can't be happening,’ he recalled. A subsequent follow-up by NBC Chicago led to OfficeMax blaming the disturbing mailing on a ‘third-party mailing list provider.’ The company also apologized in a statement. ‘We are deeply sorry that Mr. Seay and his family received this mailing from us, and we are reaching out to Mr. Seay to convey our sincerest apologies on this unfortunate matter,’ the statement said. ‘Based on a preliminary investigation today we believe this to be an inadvertent error; and we are continuing the investigation.’ That explanation brings little comfort to Mr Seay, who told the station the letter made him feel victimized.","Mike Seay received the disturbing letter this week .

At the age of just 18, Gabrielle Turnquest is not even old enough to buy an alcoholic drink in her home town of Windermere, Florida, but she has become the youngest person ever to pass The Bar exams. The average lawyer passes the Bar Professional Training Course at the age of 27, but Gabrielle was called to The Bar last month through the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn after passing her Graduate Diploma in Law at the University of Law when she was just 17. Success: Gabrielle Turnquest has become the youngest person to pass The Bar exams in more than 600 years . Ambitious: Miss Turnquest will not work as a barrister in the UK, but will instead return to her native America where she hopes to become a fashion lawyer . She doesn't plan on using her success to work as a barrister in the UK and instead plans on returning to the states in the autumn to carry on study as she hopes to forge a career as a fashion law specialist. To work in the UK, Gabrielle would have to carry out a pupillage at a chambers for a further year before being granted a tenancy. But she is also called to the Bahamas Bar, her parents' place of birth, and hopes to work there. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'I am honoured to be the youngest person to pass the Bar exams but, really, I was not aware at the time what the average age was. 'I didnâ€™t fully realise the impact of it.' Gabrielle already made history at Liberty University in Virginia, where she became the youngest student to gain an undergraduate degree, in psychology, at the age of just 16. So much, so young: Miss Turnquest made history at her last university when she became its youngest undergraduate, gaining a psychology degree at just 16 . Trainee lawyers did have to be at least 21 to be called to The Bar before a change in the law in 2009. Now that she's passed, Gabrielle is to attend the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in a bid to break into the niche market of fashion law. Gabrielle also hopes to sit the multi-state Bar in the US. Nigel Savage, President and Provost at The University of Law, said: 'Like Gabrielle, students from across the globe are recognising the importance of having a legal qualification that is widely recognised in other legal jurisdictions. 'The growing globalisation of law firms and the need for more international expertise means that it is becoming increasingly more important for young legal professionals to have experience across different legal markets if they are going to maximise the number of job opportunities that are available to them.'","Gabrielle Turnquest is the youngest qualified barrister in more than 600 years .

'He shows no remorse, no intention . of changing his ways and improving himself.' Where is she? Susan Powell, pictured with her two sons, vanished in 2009 and relatives and investigators believed she was killed by her husband, but he was never charged in the case . She added: 'I . don’t really want him back in my life at this point because I think he . was responsible, or at least knows about Susan’s disappearance.' Powell will be on probation for 30 months, required to wear a GPS locator and attend a sex-offender treatment program, KSL reported. He plans to live in Tacoma, according to the corrections facility. Deseret News reported that the two girls victimized by Powell were awarded a $1.8million settlement as part of a civil suit. After . that December ruling, the judge ordered the Pierce County Sheriff's . Office to sell off the home since it is Powell's largest non-exempt . asset - a ruling he has been fighting. Obsessed: Relatives have also said they think Steven Powell, pictured, has information about Susan's disappearance. His journal entries revealed that he was obsessed with her . Steven Powell's exploits gained national attention after his son Josh killed his own two sons in 2012. Until then, Josh Powell had been the focus of the investigation into his missing wife, Susan. Susan Powell disappeared from her home in December 2009 and her body has never been found. He had a sexual obsession with Susan Powell that was thoroughly documented in journals seized by police. In passages from 17 spiral notebooks written over more than ten years, he wrote of his sexual fantasies about Susan, how he believed she loved him too and hopes they would be together. Killer: Josh Powell tried to kill his two young sons with a hatchet in 2012 before burning down their home . Scene: The father and sons were overcome by the smoke and flames at their Washington home . He wrote: 'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem of her being married to my son. The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.' He admitted 'looking at her naked body under the bathroom door (using a mirror)' though recognized this was a 'sick' thing to do. But there is no hint that he or his son Josh had anything to do with her disappearance and he made mention of the possibility she ran off with another man - which is what Josh Powell told police. Following her disappearance, authorities found blood in the family home and a hand-written note in which Susan Powell expressed fear about her husband hurting her.","Steven Powell, the father of Josh Powell who killed his sons in a house explosion, was released from a Washington prison on Sunday .

"By . Associated Press . The mother of a northern California teenager who is in critical condition after being struck by a freight train has paid tribute to the girl's boyfriend who was killed after he pushed her out of the way. Mickayla Friend, who is currently in Sutter Roseville Medical Center, and Mateus Moore were both involved in the accident on Friday evening near Marysville's only high school. Her mother has admitted that she has not yet told her daughter Mateus has died . Investigators told KCRA-TV that the teens were walking south on the tracks - the same direction as the Union Pacific train. They were scheduled to attend a Sadie Hawkins Day dance. Young love: This photo of Mateus Moore and Mickayla friend was taken just minutes before the young couple was hit by a train . Mateus and Mickayla (left), were both aged 16. Sandy Friend, the mother of Mickayla (again pictured right), said that Mateus 'sacrificed himself' to save her daughter. He was described as Mickayla's 'first love'. Sandy Friend, Mickayla's mother, told KTXL-TV in Sacramento that she believes her daughter's boyfriend saved her life. 'She had the love of a young man. He just sacrificed himself to save my daughter,' she said. 'The most heroic thing that any other human being can do on this Earth is save the person that they love.' Mickayla, who does not yet know that Mateus has died, told her mother while lapsing in and out of consciousness: 'I remember Mateus turning and looking back. And I turned and looked back. I remember him pushing me out of the way of the train.'Mateus father Marcus added: 'I'm just really proud of him and I know that if presented the opportunity, he would dit again, to save someone's life.' First love: Family members called Moore Friend's 'first love' who was 'taken away in an instant' Marysville Police Chief David Baker . says investigators are looking into whether the pair got distracted by . headphones or something else when the accident occurred. The . conductor sounded the horn and tried to stop, but it typically takes . more than a mile to come to a halt, Union Pacific said in statement. 'Our hearts go out to the friends and family of the two individuals involved in the accident,' the statement said. 'It is a stark reminder that railroad tracks are never a safe place to be.' Mickayla's family previously described Mateus as her 'first love'. Witnesses claimed that Mikayla may have been killed as well had Mateus not pushed her out of the way at the very last second, keeping her from getting pinned underneath the train. 'It's her first boyfriend, and her first love,' Mickayla's sister, Alithya Friend, told KCRA.com. 'And she just got it taken away from her in an instant.' Sean Stark witnessed the incident and credited Mateus with saving his girlfriend's life. 'The engineer was on the horn,' Mr Stark told KCRA. 'Then finally, they both looked back at the same time.' Then, Mr Stark said, Mateus made a split-second decision that may have saved his girlfriend's life. 'They would have both been underneath that train if he didn't push her out of the way at the last second,' said Stark. Horrifying: Emergency personnel work at the scene of a train accident where two pedestrians where one teen was killed and nother critically injured after being hit by a train . The accident happened around 7.00 p.m., and in front of dozens of horrified onlookers scrambling to shield their children at a local baseball game from the traumatizing scene, according to the Appeal-Democrat.

Critical: A medivac helicopter arrives at the scene to whisk the critically injured female to a nearby hospital . Every parent's worst nightmare: Police on the scene of the terible accident . 'It wasn't one of our kids, just get . back,' she recalled telling the swelling crowd, adding that her next . priority was keeping children from seeing what had happened. 'Once they . see that, that can't be unseen.' People . who were at the game told the Marysville Appeal-Democrat they heard a . long blowing of the train's horn, much longer than usual. 'He honked from so far back there,' a concession stand volunteer told the paper. Another said the engineer honked 'a bunch and a bunch and a bunch.' The small town of about 12,000 was rocked by the incident. 'Marysville . is a small but busy city,' said a fire department spokesman. 'Everybody knows everybody so it was pretty traumatic.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The dreaded flu virus is taking the U.S. by storm as this year's strain continues to work its way across the country - and in its wake it already has left 20 children dead, according to new numbers released Friday by federal health officials. That number has doubled from 10 since last week's report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the number of reported pediatric flu deaths. For many, the flu is little more than a cough and a fever. But health officials want the public to know that in many case it can also be deadly. Vaccine: Health officials urge everyone to get a flu shot to avoid falling victim to the deadly virus . Outbreak: This year's flu virus has made its way across the entire country and has left 20 children dead so far . And not just for children and the elderly. 'The highest hospitalization rate is among adults aged 65 years or older, . followed by those in age groups 0-4 years and 50-64 years,' the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . reports in its weekly statistic on flu. 'However, those aged 18-64 years . still account for 61 percent of reported hospitalized cases.' According to the CDC, anywhere from 3,000 to 49,000 people die every year from flu-related illnesses, and this year is no different. One of the most recent instances of a child dying from the flu virus is the death of Savannah Hyden. Hyden died last week at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital near Vanderbilt University near Nashville. According to her parents, the girl had not been given a flu vaccine this year. 'She was brilliant in every aspect,' her father, Steven Hyden, told the Tennessean. 'We have really taken a big loss. ... She could have been the president.' Tragic: 5-year-old Ronan Burgess is one of 20 children to die in this year's flu outbreak . Victim: 8-year-old Kaitlyn Mills, of Louisiana, also died after being infected with the flu . Hayden's mother, Natasha Renee Fiser, told the paper that her daughter developed a bacterial infection after contracting the flu. The infection caused the girl to go into cardiac arrest. 'She was down for too long, there was no oxygen to her brain, and her organs just started shutting down,' Fiser said. Fiser says she was shocked that her daughter got sick and then three days later was put on life support. Another child to succumb to the virus was Lydia Christine Kizziar of Carrollton, Texas. She was just a seventh grader when she died earlier this month - and her little sister is in the hospital fighting off the very same illness. Lydia's circumstance is increasingly common. Texas has been hard-hit this year as swine flu, or H1N1, pummels the Southern U.S. and threatens Americans nationwide. Heartbroken: Lydia Kizziar, 13, (right) was killed by the flu virus. Her sister also was hospitalized for the disease . Savannah Hyden, 11, also died from complications related to the flu. Her parents say she didn't get vaccinated . Another child victim of this year's flu virus is 8-year-old Kaitlyn Mills of Bossier City, Louisianan. Mills died last week after contracting the H1N1 virus -  just one day after her parents reportedly noticed their daughter suffering from flu-like symptoms. A  5-year-old Oregon boy, Ronan Burgess, also died from the H1N1 virus. According to the CDC, 25 percent of those who go to the hospital and are tested for the flu test positive for influenza. At this same point in last year's flu season, 29 children had died. Health officials stress that there are antiviral drugs that will combat the flu, and if those infected get treated quickly they will more than likely recover.","Anywhere from 3,000 to 49,000 people die every year from flu-related illnesses .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A doctor has been charged with sexually assaulting a bedridden, 61-year-old female patient during visits to her home over a three-year period. Dr Charles S. Dehaan, 59, appeared in court on Sunday in Cook County, Illinois, where he was held on $250,000 bond. The doctor, who is married and has three children, was ordered to surrender his passport. It is suspected that Dehaan, of Belvidere, sexually assaulted up to 11 other patients, Assistant Stateâ€™s Attorney Dan Calandriello said. Dr Charles Dehaan, 59, has been charged with sexual assault after he allegedly attacked a 61-year-old bedridden woman in Illinois . According to prosecutors, between 2009 and 2012, Dehaan would close the door to the woman's room and fondle her while forcing her to touch his genitals, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The woman, who has psychiatric problems, reportedly did not think anyone would believe her because Dehaan was respected daughter. Witnesses later told authorities that the patient seemed distraught after the doctor visited her to treat her anxiety disorder. A federal affidavit details other sexual assaults that Dehaan allegedly committed against patients. One widow was allegedly told by the doctor 'she needed a man in her life'. The doctor's medical license had been suspended in January, according to state records seen by Sun Times. However he is still licensed to practice in other states. The alleged victim said she was too scared to report Dehaan as she thought he would cut off her medical care. He was charged with nine counts of engaging in a scheme to defraud Medicare from his Rockford practice. Dehaan has also been indicted for Medicare fraud, according to federal documents released in February.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Delaware clinic in which 'house of horrors' abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell performed late-term terminations is being turned into an emergency food and support center for poor families. Lutheran Community Services purchased the building in Wilmington, formerly known as Atlantic Women’s Medical Services, last year to serve as its new headquarters. The Christian group knew of the building's gruesome history. 'It's going to be a place of hope and life,' executive director Jean Warren told FoxNews.com. Delaware clinic . New lease: Lutheran Community Services purchased the former Atlantic Women's Medical Services building Wilmington, Delaware (pictured) last year to serve as its new headquarters . Unrepentant: Abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was sentenced to life behind bars after being found guilty last year . Gosnell, a Philadelphia doctor sentenced to life in prison, once practiced at the Delaware facility. According to the Philadelphia Grand Jury report, Gosnell would induce late-term abortions at the Delaware clinic - where they were illegal - and finish them off at his west Philadelphia clinic, the Women's Medical Society. None of the charges Gosnell, 73, was ultimately convicted of stemmed from his actions at the Delaware facility. Renewal: Lutheran Community Services executive director Jean Warren (pictured) said the Delaware clinic will become 'a place of hope and life' In May last year, Gosnell was found guilty of murdering three babies born alive. A jury also declared him guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the drug overdose death of a 41-year-old patient, Karnamaya Mongar. Investigators described his Philadelphia clinic as a chaotic 'house of horrors', replete with fetal remains in the staff refrigerator, specimen jars of severed feet in his office and dirty medical instruments in the surgery rooms. Authorities in Pennsylvania had failed to conduct routine inspections of all its abortion clinics for 15 years by the time Gosnell's facility was raided as part of a prescription drug investigation. Gosnell later pleaded guilty in federal court to running a pill mill for addicts and drug dealers. In the scandal's aftermath, two top state health officials were fired, and the state imposed tougher rules for clinics. Former clinic employees testified that Gosnell routinely performed illegal abortions past Pennsylvania's 24-week limit. They said that Gosnell delivered babies who were still moving and that he and his assistants killed them by snipping their spines with scissors. Gosnell's own lawyers said perhaps the doctor's biggest transgression may have been hiring high school dropouts and other unqualified people to act as doctors. The employees performed abortions, administered anesthesia and monitored high-risk patients. Gosnell was spared the death penalty after striking a plea deal. Instead, he will serve his life sentences consecutively and without parole after giving up his right to appeal. 'House of horrors' in Philadelphia . 'House of horrors': Fetal remains were found at Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic, the Women¿s Medical Society (pictured) Four former clinic employees pleaded guilty to murder and four more to other charges. The co-defendants included Gosnell's wife, a cosmetologist who helped perform abortions. Despite the life sentence, Gosnell was acquitted in the deaths of four other babies. Following Gosnell’s sentencing, the case’s gag order was lifted, allowing Philadelphia Police crime scene investigator John Taggart to expose the atrocities he had witnessed inside the Philadelphia clinic. Taggart said corpses of dead babies and body parts were found everywhere, including in fridges and cabinets, at the 3801 Lancaster Avenue facility. ‘The smells were just unbearable,’ Taggart told NBC 10. ‘You could tell there was death somewhere.’ Investigators had revealed in court how baby body parts would clog toilets after women delivered them in stalls inside the clinic, but Taggart also said that remains were uncovered in the break room sink. Tragic: Gosnell was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, 41 (left) who died after an abortion . Unfathomable: A grand jury photograph shows what police say are plastic bags hiding body parts in a refrigerator inside the Philadelphia practice . ‘They were shoving body parts down the . garbage disposal,’ Taggart said. ‘To the point where they plunged it one . day and an arm popped out on Lancaster Avenue.’ Prosecutors say . Gosnell would deliver some babies alive, despite giving them medication . in utero meant to stop their heart. The doctor and his staff would then . snip their necks with scissors to ensure death. Investigators also . visited Gosnell’s shore home in Brigantine, N.J. to search for the . remains of unaccounted fetuses. Neither they nor New Jersey authorities . who sent a dive team into the bay were able to locate any remains. ‘I . believe they are either buried out there or I don’t know where they . are. We’ve looked, we’ve looked for three years,’ Taggart said. Gosnell has been in jail since his January 2011 arrest. The business apparently made Gosnell a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions. Authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $1.8 million a year, and found $250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . The inmate allegedly assaulted by former NFL star Aaron Hernandez has been released on bail, police have said. Andrew Booker, 25, was reportedly attacked by the ex-New England Patriot at Bristol County House of Correction in North Dartmouth. He was wearing handcuffs at the time of the fight - and was allegedly left with a number of cuts, bruises and scrapes. Fight: Andrew Booker (left) was allegedly attacked by Aaron Hernandez (right) at a Bristol County jail last month . Now, the prisoner, who was in jail on drug and weapons-related charges, has been released on bail, a spokesman for the Bristol County Sheriff told WCVB. It comes as Booker's lawyer has said his client does not want to testify about the incident, which happened at the facility in late February. 'He doesn't want to go after Hernandez. He doesn't want to be a rat,' attorney Michael Maloney told the Atteleboro Sun-Chronicle. This is despite Bristol County Sheriff, Thomas Hodgson, previously claiming his office is seeking a criminal complaint for assault against Hernandez., who has been in prison since June 26 last year. Worried: The former NFL star appears concerned during a hearing at Bristol Superior Court on February 7 . In cuffs: Hernandez, pictured at Attleboro District court, was not handcuffed at the time of the alleged attack . Booker, who has pleaded not guilty following his arrest last September, allegedly 'exchanged words' with Hernandez several weeks before the attack, before the pair went their separate ways. However, the two men later bumped into each other in a hallway in the prison - prompting Hernandez to reportedly launch the assault. 'They were having a verbal feud. It escalated, got out of control and Booker was assaulted while handcuffed,' said Mr Maloney. Scene: The fight took place at Bristol County House of Correction (pictured) in North Dartmouth in late February . The alleged victim was left with a number of cuts, bruises and scrapes, according to TMZ, but no charges have yet been issued. Hernandez, who was not wearing handcuffs at the time, was moved to a special isolation unit following the alleged attack, where he must stay for up to 30 days. The former Patriots tight end is currently awaiting trial for the shooting death of Odin Lloyd. He is also being sued by the families of two men who were killed in a 2012 drive-by shooting outside a Boston nightclub.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A decorated Navy pilot turned U.S. Senate candidate from Nebraska who once went down over China is catching heat from fellow soldiers over claims he's a hero. Shane Osborn, 39, was awarded the Navy's highest honor for piloting prowess after he skillfully maneuvered to land his damaged spy plane in April 2001, but as the midterm elections heat up, critics are becoming more vocal in decrying his decision as counter to centuries of Navy tradition. 'Once they landed on land, it was U.S. property. You shouldn't surrender it,' prominent naval analyst Norman Polmar told the Omaha World-Herald. Hero? A decorated Navy pilot who's turned himself into a Republican U.S. Senate hopeful in Nebraska is facing questions about the 2001 crash landing in China that made him a hero . Disaster averted? Osborn, seen here hugging his girlfriend after returning home from being held in China for 11 days, piloted a nearly unflyable spy plane to safety in China in 2001 . According to some of the Republican's detractors, Osborn was wrong when he piloted the surveillance plane, which had collided with a Chinese fighter plane, onto China's island of Hainan. Some of them believe he should have flown the plane and all its 23 crewmen into the South China Sea. 'Our standing order was ""If you can't get back to the carrier, you put it down in the water,”' said long-serving Navy pilot from Nebraska Danny Mason. 'In the 20 years I was flying — any aircraft — you weren't going to take it into China,' Mason told the World-Herald. Osborn and his crew began destroying sensitive gear and surveillance devices as soon as it became clear they were going in for a landing at Hainan. 'I would not have let (the Chinese) take that airplane. I would have left it a smoldering hulk,' said Polmar. Osborn . and his crew ultimately surrendered to armed Chinese soldiers. They . destroyed what they could, though they couldn't get it all and the plane . wound up in the hands of the Chinese. 'This is, like, the worst armchair quarterbacking in the history of . quarterbacking,' Osborn says of his naysayers. 'My job was to bring my crew home, safely . and alive at that point. That's what I did. I didn't want anyone getting . shot. That wouldn't do any good.' He . and his crew were released after being detained 11 days. The pilot . became a media darling and was invited to dinner at the White House for . dinner and mentioned in several speeches made by George W. Bush. But . in addition to his decision to land in China, Osborn is being attacked . for his continued references to his naval record and accomplishments as . part of his campaign. According to the World-Herald, Osborn writes in a fundraising mailer: . 'I . set an undisputed world record by flying a nearly un-flyable EP-3 Spy . Plane INVERTED FOR NEARLY TWO MILES — WITH NO INSTRUMENTS AND ONLY 50% . POWER.' Did the right thing? Now that he's running for Senate, some detractors--many of them military vets--are saying he broke with centuries of Navy tradition by allowing the plane to land in the hands of the Chinese . That doesn't sit well with vets like retired Air Force brigadier general Carl Lorenzen. 'All these people who came back from World War II, nobody ever bragged about their experiences. This is bragging,' said  'I've never seen this kind of behavior from an officer in the military.' But Osborn refuses to apologize to men like Lorenzen. 'I flew combat missions in Afghanistan. I flew combat missions in Iraq. It is absolutely a big part of my campaign,' Osborn said. And he says it's more important now than ever before that candidates like him make it into Congress. 'We have the lowest number of veterans in the United States Senate in the history of this country,' he said.","Shane Osborn saved 23 crewmen in 2001 when he landed a badly damaged spy plane in China before being taken prisoner .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Accused bullier Richie Incognito has urged his alleged victim Jonathan Martin to call him through a string of Twitter messages posted Monday. Incognito, who was suspended from the Miami Dolphins after Martin accused him of bullying him using racial slurs, returned to social media last week following unspecified treatment. In the early hours of Monday morning, he posted two messages directed at his former teammate that were visible to his 92,000 followers. Reaching out, virtually: Richie Incognito (left) directed Twitter posts at his former teammate Jonathan Martin (right) who he was accused of bullying with racial slurs when they were on the Dolphins together . Call for help: Incognito has been tweeting since finishing his unspecified treatment program . '@J_Martin71 Call me on my cell phone.  Love you brother.  Sh** got crazy but we held it together.  #CALLME #FAMILY,' he wrote. '@j_martin71 No hard feelings.  Let's just move on :).' Back to his roots: Martin has been signed to the San Francisco 49ers which is headed by his old Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh . For his part, Martin has not responded and appears to be moving on his own way by training with his new teammates on the San Francisco 49ers. 'Back to work... #Rise&Grind,' he wrote about nine hours after Incognito's tweets. A person familiar with Incognito's situation said the veteran lineman was exhausted after being 'dragged through the mud' in recent months. An NFL investigation determined Incognito and two other Miami Dolphins offensive linemen engaged in persistent harassment of teammate Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October. Incognito was then suspended and missed the final eight games, and he became a free agent last week when his contract with the Dolphins expired. 'Looking forward to getting back to work ASAP,' Incognito tweeted Tuesday, punctuating the comment with a smiley face. Incognito sent tweets last month that varied dramatically in tone. He went on a rant that quickly went viral, blasting Martin and his agent, then later tweeted apologies to Martin, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and Ted Wells, the attorney who investigated the bullying scandal for the NFL. For his part, Martin has been picked up by the San Francisco team by a familiar face. Moving on without him: Martin posted to his Twitter account about nine hours after Incognito made his pleas . San Francisco's Jim Harbaugh once sat in Martin's living room to recruit him, coached him for three years at Stanford and developed Martin into an All-American and a second-round draft pick, then stood by him from afar as Martin accused a Miami teammate of bullying last year.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Scam? Christina Lee Jensen, 36, pictured, was arrested Friday after a 17 month investigation by Fairview Township police . A Pennsylvania woman is accused of scamming a couple desperate to have a baby out of thousands of dollars when she agreed to act as a surrogate mother for them. Christina Lee Jensen, 36, was arrested Friday after a 17 month investigation by Fairview Township police. She's facing charges of forgery, theft by deception and other offenses, according to a statement. The victims, a couple from Maryland, first reported the woman to police in August 2012 after they became suspicious that Jensen wasn't being truthful, police said. The couple, who haven't been identified, said they chose Jensen to be their gestational carrier around May 2011 and she signed a surrogacy agreement. But they soon came to believe she had ulterior motives and contacted authorities, telling them they were being victimized by her. Police began probing Jensen's activity. Months later, they determined that she had forged an attorney's signature, but also fabricated several legal documents, receipts and emails. In all, she defrauded the couple out of $4,300, the police statement says. Jensen was charged with forgery, theft by deception, receiving stolen property and unlawful use of a computer, according to court records. Home: Jensen was arrested at her York County home, pictured, and taken into custody . She was released after posting $70,000 bail but is waiting for a preliminary hearing date. Surrogacy laws vary state by state. In Pennsylvania, no law regulates surrogacy. Intended parents often find surrogate mothers through agencies, and are generally compensated up to $20,000 and $25,000 for a single fetus and an additional $3000 to $5000 for a multiple birth. It's not clear whether the couple found Jensen through such an agency or how much they had agreed to pay her in total for the birth.","Pennsylvania woman Christina Lee Jensen, 36, was arrested Friday after a 17 month investigation by Fairview Township police .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Mayor Bill de Blasio's pledge to settle the wrongful conviction of five men nicknamed the 'Central Park Five' against New York City could cost the city millions of dollars. Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson and Kharey 'Khorey' Wise were convicted as teenagers for the 1989 beating and rape of Patricia Meili, The Wall Street Journal reports. Mellis was jogging at the time in Central Park. The five men were convicted based on their statements to police and before their trials served between 6 3/4 and 13 years in prison, the newspaper says. Members of the Central Park Five Raymond Santana (L), Kevin Richardson (2nd L) and Yusef Salaam (R) along with Angela Black, Richardson's sister, take part in a rally in their support in this January 2013 photos. The men filed a civil suit against New York City in 2003 . Accused rapist Yusef Salaam is seen here being escorted by  police in New York in 1990. Salaam was one of the subjects of the documentary, 'The Central Park Five.' The men's convictions were overturned in 2002 and filed a civil lawsuit against New York City in 2003 . Flowers were laid at the site of Patricia Meili's 1989 beating and sexual assault in Central Park . The decision was overturned in 2002 when Matias Reyes, a convicted rapist, told authorities he alone attacked Melli. DNA tests confirmed  the sexual assault. Reyes has not been prosecuted because the statute of limitations has passed, the paper reports. The five men who were convicted for the 1989 attack filed a civil lawsuit against New York City in December 2003, saying they were tricked into making false statements, the Journal reports. Each of the 'Central Park Five' have . asked for $50 million, the Journal reports -- but in an analysis of . other wrongful conviction settlements found that the average payout . would be about $305,000 for each year in prison. A policeman is seen here with some of the victim's clothes in this 1989 file photo. DNA evidence later identified Matias Reyes as the attacker in 2002 . The men's convictions were overturned in 2002 . Using this method, the five men would receive between $2 million and slightly under $4 million each. The case was litigated for 10 years under then-mayor Michael Bloomberg, the Journal reports -- and a judge agreed with the city's arguments that the men's statements weren't forced. The case was also the subject of a 2012 Ken Burns documentary film, 'The Central Park Five.' In December last year, de Blasio said regarding the case 'a huge injustice was done' and that the settlement would happen 'quickly,' New York Magazine says. Ronald Kuby, an attorney not affiliated with the case who recently obtained a $2 million wrongful conviction settlement for a Bronx man, told the paper that 'the city actually has a legally viable defense but it's so morally odious.' 'Essentially that [defense] being that ""yeah we made a terrible mistake, sorry kids, but nobody intentionally violated your rights,""' Kuby said.","Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Raymond .

The mother of a missing eight-year-old girl is pleading for the safe return of her daughter who is believed to have been kidnapped by a janitor who worked at the homeless shelter where the family were staying. Khalil Tatum, 51, has already been charged with murdering his wife Andrea Tatum after her body was found in Red Roof Inn, in Oxon Hill, Washington, last Thursday - a day after Relisha Rudd was reported missing. Police have not yet revealed how Mrs Tatum died but it has been reported that her body showed signs of trauma. Relisha's family allowed the child to be looked after by Tatum who the family got to know over an 18-month period when they were staying at the shelter. According to police, Relisha's mother asked Tatum to look after her daughter on February 26. Miss Young, 27, was living at the homeless shelter at the former D.C. General Hospital with four of her children and their stepfather. Relisha is about 4ft tall and weighs between 70 and 80 pounds. According to police, officers obtained a search warrant on Thursday and went to the Red Roof Inn where they found Mrs Tatum's body in a room. Tatum's white truck was in the Inn's parking lot. Police said Miss Young initially didn't report Relisha missing and told officers she had spoken to her by phone on Wednesday. However, it has since been revealed that Miss Young met with Tatum and asked him to return Relisha which he has not done. On the run: Khalil Tatum, 51, has already been charged with murdering his wife Andrea Tatum . Jamila Larson, executive director of the Homeless Childrenâ€™s Playtime Project which runs programs at five D.C. shelters, including the one at D.C.

"By . Mark Duell . A domestic violence victim sexually exploited by a police officer on a 999 call was today suing a force for £25,000 over gross abuse of power claims. PC James Formby, 34, was on duty and in uniform in Bromley, south-east London, five years ago when he allegedly plied the ‘vulnerable’ woman with drink and engaged in a sexual act with her. He was convicted of criminal misconduct in 2010 and dismissed from the Metropolitan Police - but the force does not accept responsibility for his actions, and the woman aged 37 is now suing them. In court: PC James Formby (left, and right at his sentencing in 2010), 34, allegedly plied the ‘vulnerable’ woman with drink and engaged in a sexual act with her . Ruth . Brander, representing the claimant, said: ‘The claimant accepts the . account she gave to police shortly after these events. She stated she . had asked Formby to kiss her.’ She . added that Formby then asked the woman, who cannot be named for legal . reasons, to perform a sex act on him and later texted her, saying: ‘You . were amazing. Can't wait to see you again Xxx.’ The . woman is now suing the Metropolitan Police for compensation of up to . £15,400, plus a further £11,000 ‘if it is found that the claimant did . not have a capacity to consent to the sexual activity’. She will be giving evidence . about the September 2009 incident at Central London County Court near . Regent’s Park in front of the former officer, in a bid for compensation . from the force. In . her skeleton argument, Miss Brander said: ‘The complainant complains . that Formby, for whom the defendant is vicariously liable, abused his . position of trust as a police officer and the claimant was an . intoxicated victim of domestic abuse.’ She . added that he ‘took advantage of her vulnerable state for his own . sexual gratification in circumstances where he was in wilful neglect of . his duty and was recklessly indifferent to the harm that was likely to . be, and was, caused to the claimant as a result’. Lawsuit: PC Formby was convicted of criminal misconduct and dismissed from the Metropolitan Police . She . said: ‘Formby was charged by the defendant and convicted, by his own . guilty plea, of misconduct in a public office in respect of events . forming the basis of the claimant's claim. ‘Further he has been dismissed from the defendant's force for gross misconduct and bringing the force into disrepute. 'She felt confused and was trying to sort out in her head whether she had a right to be angry' Ruth Brander, for the woman . ‘Yet . in these proceedings, the defendant seeks to deny that the officer's . conduct constitutes misfeasance and, in the alternative, denies that . [the force] is vicariously liable for such conduct.’ Miss . Brander told the court that at first her client had not realised what . had happened but that when she ‘sobered up’ she became ‘increasingly . concerned and distressed’. She . added: ‘She was also blaming herself for what happened. Initially she . felt that because she had not said “no”, she had let it happen and this . caused her to question whether it was her fault. ‘It . had not sunk in at that stage how wrong it was for an officer to have . acted in that way. She felt confused and was trying to sort out in her . head whether she had a right to be angry.' Scotland Yard: PC James Formby, 34, was on duty and in uniform in Bromley, south-east London, five years ago when he allegedly plied the ‘vulnerable’ woman with drink and engaged in a sexual act with her . Miss Brander also submitted that following the incident her client had suffered a ‘depressive and anxious adjustment disorder’. She said that this fell within the range of £4,730 to £15,400 for damages. However, . she added that if it was found that her client had not had capacity to . consent, then a further sum should be awarded to reflect the assault, . with a tariff of up to £11,000 available in respect of non-consensual . penile penetration. Miss . Brander submitted that there are number of aggravating features that . would mean she would not receive sufficient compensation if the awards . were restricted to a basic award. She . outlined these as being the ‘significant degree of humiliation’ suffered by her client, the fact that Formby's actions involved a grave . breach of trust and a reckless disregard for the legality of his . actions. It was added the claimant was ‘especially vulnerable through her intoxication’ and her recent experience of domestic violence. Miss . Brander said: ‘The Commissioner resists the claimant's claim on . misfeasance on the basis that sexual activity was consensual and . consensual sexual activity was not in the performance - or purported . performance - of the Additional Party's (Formby's) duties as an officer. Hearing in 2010: PC Formby was given a 20-week sentence suspended for two years at Southwark Crown Court (pictured). He was also told to pay £1,000 costs and carry out 200 hours of unpaid work . ‘The claimant maintains . that consent is something of a red herring in the context of this case. It is an essential part of the offence of misfeasance in a public office . that the victim of the misfeasance has not [consented].’ She added that an expert had concluded that the woman had not been ‘capable’ of consent at the time of the incident. The . police claim no unlawful act took place because the woman had consented . to the sexual act - and that the force is not liable for PC Formby’s . actions because he was on a ‘mission of his own’. PC . Formby was given a 20-week sentence suspended for two years at . Southwark Crown Court. He was also told to pay £1,000 costs and carry . out 200 hours of unpaid work. A . Metropolitan Police spokesman told MailOnline before the hearing began . today: ‘The officer pleaded guilty at court and has been dismissed from . the Metropolitan Police Service. ‘We . are aware of a civil action being taken against the Metropolitan Police . Service, due to commence at Central London county court on March 24 . [today]. We will be defending this action.’ The hearing is due to last four days at Central London County Court. The case continues.","PC James Formby had been on duty and in uniform in Bromley, London .

"By . Sam Webb . A man who was jailed for torturing and murdering a father is now free to stay with his family - just a mile from the victim's daughter. Terence Haddow, 68, who killed Kevin Bruce in 2002 in Edinburgh, has been given a first term release, which allows him out of prison for five days at a time. The victim's daughter Julie, 25, who was 13 when her father died, said the news was a 'kick in the stomach'. Haddow and Sturgeon were jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 14 years at the High Court in Edinburgh. Julie Bruce has spoken of her ordeal after it was revealed the killer of her father Kevin, pictured with his daughter in 1988, will be allowed out of prison for five days at a time . Mr Bruce was beaten, had his cheeks slashed and his feet torn apart by a cheese grater by Haddow and Gordon Sturgeon. The 38-year-old's injuries were so severe pathologists doing the post-mortem lost count of the wounds, while a detective said they were the most horrific he had ever seen. They carried out the attack after a claim by Haddow’s girlfriend, Sharon Mortimer, that Mr Bruce had molested her. During the three-day ordeal the attackers took Mr Bruce to get his benefits payments so they could buy alcohol. Killer: Terry Haddow (left) in 2002 after he was sentenced to life in prison . Ms Bruce, 25, from Edinburgh, told the Daily Record: 'My dad won’t be able to give me away at my wedding, he won’t meet his grandchildren and he will never be there for me because of the evil actions of these two men. 'He was in excruciating pain before he died, and now one of them is allowed to pop out of prison to see his family. 'It doesn’t seem fair. I feel the justice system has failed me.' Her parents split when she was 10, but Ms Bruce would see her father, who she described as a 'kind, lovely man', every week. The administrator discovered that Haddow would be allowed out of prison after signing the victim notification scheme. She now fears bumping into him in the street if he goes back to his last known address, just a mile from her home. Ms Bruce has also called for a change in the law so a life sentence actually means life in prison. A Scottish Prison Service spokeswoman said: 'The granting of temporary release on licence conditions is an integral part of preparing long-term prisoners for returning to their communities and loved ones upon release. 'Each individual who begins the process is subject to rigorous risk assessment at each stage of progression. 'Any breach of licence immediately results in a return to closed conditions and a removal of community-based privileges.'","Julie Bruce's father Kevin was tortured to death in 2002 .

"By . Sam Webb . Resolve: Lord Dannatt says Britain must retain military strength in mainland Europe . Britain must send a strong signal to Russia's aggression in the Ukraine by reversing the cost-cutting decision to remove all troops from Germany. The number of British servicemen will drop from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, although bolstered by an extra 11,000 reservists, and all troops based in Germany, currently around 20,000, will leave by 2019. But Lord Dannatt, who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2008, has proposed that 3,000 British soldiers should stay on in Germany to send a clear message to a 'resurgent Russia'. His comments come as Ukraine's leaders spoke of their fears of an imminent Russian invasion of their eastern industrial heartland after the last airbase in Crimea was taken over. The concern follows the violent storming of the military compound in Belbek, the biggest show of Russian force in the three weeks Kremlin troops have been stationed in the peninsula. Since the annexation of the region was confirmed on Friday, Russian troops have began to gather at the eastern border and Ukraine's military leaders believe they are ready to attack 'at any moment. Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council chief Andriy Parubiy told a rally in Kiev:'The aim of Putin is not Crimea but all of Ukraine... his troops massed at the border are ready to attack at any moment.' The interim leaders in Kiev fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin is developing a sense he could get away with further actions after the EU and U.S. only handed him limited sanctions. Lord Dannatt, in an article for The Daily Telegraph, said that military strength will add weight to diplomatic negotiations with Moscow. 'With a resurgent Russia, this is a poor moment for the U.S.-led West to be weak in resolve and muscle,' he said. Patrol: Men believed to be Russian soldiers walk near an Ukrainian military building, which was taken by Russian soldiers in the village of Perevalnoye, outside Simferopol, Ukraine . 'Diplomacy and sanctions may be the right response for now to the Russian president, but he will look beyond those things to see where the real check on his actions might come from. 'An additional 3,000 regular soldiers would provide an extra deployable brigade, sending the signal that Britain takes its defence duties seriously â€“ not only on behalf of its citizens, but on behalf of our EU and Nato allies, too.' He also expressed concerns that falling troop levels could leave Britain unprepared for unexpected crises, such as the invasion of the Falklands. NATO's top military commander today added to fears, suggesting Russia had built up a 'very sizeable' force and even speculated Moscow could have other former Soviet states in its sights. Troops from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, prepare Warrior armoured vehicles at a base in Celle, Germany in January 2003 . Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove said Moldova, could be next if Putin decides to put his expansionist policies in place. Breedlove was one of several Western officials and politicians to warn that Russia may not stop there in a crisis that has damaged East-West relations. 'The (Russian) force that is at the Ukrainian border now to the east is very, very sizeable and very, very ready,' the NATO commander told an event held by the German Marshall Fund think-tank.' U.S. President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the build-up might just be aimed at intimidating Ukraine's new pro-Western leaders but that Russia could invade the country's mainly Russian-speaking east. Occupation: Pro-Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms arrange a position near a Ukrainian marine base in the city of Feodosia, Crimea, yesterday . 'It's possible that they are preparing to move in,' he told CNN. Russia said it was complying with international agreements and had no plans to invade. It has called the soldiers who took over Ukrainian bases in Crimea 'self defence forces'. Around 440 Russian 'peacekeepers' have been deployed in Transdniestria, a breakaway state on the eastern Moldovan border with Ukraine, with soldiers guarding Soviet-era arms stocks. It follows a launch of a new military exercise in the area, involving 8,500 artillery men, near Ukraine's eastern border 10 days ago. 'There is absolutely sufficient (Russian) force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Transdniestria if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome,' Breedlove said. The speaker of Transdniestria's parliament has urged Russia to incorporate the region, which lies to the west of Ukraine. General Francis Richard Dannatt, 63, was born in Broomfield in Chelmsford, Essex, and joined the Army in 1971. He served as a platoon commander in  Northern Ireland, where he was awarded the Military Cross. Despite suffering a major stroke in 1977, Lord Dannatt became a company commander and eventually took command of the Green Howards in 1989. He took command of 3rd Mechanised Division in 1999 and simultaneously commanded British forces in Kosovo. After a brief tour in Bosnia, he was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff. By 2005 Lord Dannatt was Commander-in-Chief, Land Command, and was appointed Chief of the General Staff in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Lord Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers and for reducing operations in Iraq to bolster those in Afghanistan. He also brokered the agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He has served as a defence advisor to David Cameron. He is married with four children, one of whom served as an officer in the Grenadier Guards.","Lord Dannatt says troops would underpin diplomacy with Russia .

"By . John Hall . An elderly couple who couldn't face life apart died within hours of each other in a 'real-life love story' that resembled the plot of hit Hollywood film The Notebook. Billy Grimes, 80 and his wife Dolly, 79, had been married for 60 years before they were admitted to Fazakerley Hospital in Merseyside, where they both died on March 15. Family members have compared the couple's deaths to the 2004 film The Notebook, where an elderly man played by James Garner dies peacefully in bed along with his dementia-suffering childhood sweetheart.

Long love: Billy Grimes, 80 (left) and his wife Dolly, 79, (right) had been married for 60 years before they were admitted to Fazakerley Hospital in Merseyside, where they both died on March 15 .

History: Billy and Dolly's daughter Dolly Maxwell holds a picture of her parents taken on their 1955 wedding day . Mr Grimes was admitted to Fazakerley Hospital three weeks before his death after suffering a heart attack and kidney failure at the end of February. Mrs Grimes was taken ill just one day before she died, with doctors giving her only 24 hours to live. Caring medical staff moved Mrs Grimes . to her husband’s ward in the early hours of March 15 - with Mr Grimes hanging on long enough to spend a few minutes with his wife before passing away. Mrs Grimes died just a few hours later. Partners: Mr Grimes (left) was admitted to Fazakerley Hospital three weeks before his death. Mrs Grimes (right) was taken ill just one day before she died, with doctors giving her only 24 hours to live .

In the film, an elderly man, 'Duke' (played by James Garner), is seen reading a story to a dementia-suffering woman, Allie (played by Gena Rowlands). The story he reads tells the story of a young man, Noah Calhoun (played by Ryan Gosling), and a 17-year-old heiress (played by Rachel McAdams) during the Second World War. After a summer romance, the couple split when Noah goes off to war and the heiress reluctantly gets married. Later in the film in becomes clear that 'Duke' is in fact Noah, and Allie is the heiress and the story is taken from notes Allie made about her love for Noah after being told of her dementia. In the present day 'Duke' suffers a heart attack and is taken to the same care home as Allie. As the film ends, Duke comforts Allie - who is worrying about her deteriorating memory. The couple are then seen lying next to each other in bed, with nurses finding them both peacefully passed away the next day. The film had mixed reviews upon its release, but has since gained a cult following - winning eight Teen Choice Awards, a Satellite Award and a MTV Movie Award. The couple's daughter Dolly Maxwell, 57, said she believed the couple couldn’t bear to be parted and described their deaths as a 'real-life love story'. 'What happened in the hospital was just so surreal, you couldn’t make it up,' she added. 'We knew dad was dying but he hung on to see mum one last time. And as soon as she came around the corner he died, it was like he was holding on for her.' 'I don’t think either one would have been able to cope without the other. It is so sad but I take great comfort in knowing that they are still together.' 'Everybody keeps saying how surreal it is that they died on the same day. It is a real life love story.' Mr and Mrs Grimes grew up together in Liverpool as children, but it wasn’t until Mr Grimes returned as a teenager after being evacuated during in the Second World War that they started a relationship. Marrying in 1955 at the age of 20, the couple would have celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary next year. The couple had eight children in eight years - but infant son Frank died from meningitis at the age of 11 months ,and they also lost their son Barry at the age of 49. Speaking of her parents' deaths, Mrs Maxwell said: 'The hospital staff were amazing, moving mum so early in the morning just so they could be together.'

They couldn’t do anything for him, then mum got taken in with pains,' she added. 'We knew that dad was dying and they brought my mum up to the same ward, the doctors said she only had 24 hours to live, ' she went on to say. Mrs Maxwell added that two of her brothers were travelling back from Canterbury to visit their parents on the day, and said it was as if Mrs Grimes was hanging on for them before she also passed away. 'She was very family oriented and was always supportive. My dad was a real man’s man,' she said. 'In a way it’s a comfort that they’ve gone together, although we didn’t expect my mum to go... One couldn’t have lived without the other,' Mrs Maxwell added.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Under attack: Fraudsters have targeted account holders at the private bank, one of the oldest in the world, by knocking on their doors wearing fake uniforms . Fraudsters dressed as private bankers are targeting some of Britain's richest customers by knocking on their door and asking for financial information, it was revealed today. C Hoare & Co, the nation's oldest private bank, has written to account holders warning them to be vigilant as scammers become increasingly confident. Dressed in distinctive uniforms with extensive braiding, the organised fraudsters target three customers a week, fooling some out of thousands of pounds. First, they send a series of emails to some of the 10,000 customers from a bogus website, before following up with a home visit in costume. Hacking emails, they managed to squander as much as £500,000 from the client of one account holder. Alexander Hoare, managing partner and a descendant of the founder of C Hoare & Co, told MailOnline: 'Everyone is under attack all the time, we need to keep people's guards up. 'We've got professional defences, and as a private bank we can recognise a customer's voice, which most banks cannot do. 'But we are urging customers to use our internet banking system, which is safer than post, or the mobile app once it is built.' The bank, which has a balance sheet of around £2.3billion, has been owned and directed by members of the Hoare family since it was founded by Richard Hoare in 1672. Started during a surge of private banks in the 17th and 18th century, it is the only remaining firm of its kind. The family moved their business to Fleet Street from Cheapside in 1690, where it remains today. Warning: Alexander Hoare, managing partner and descendant of the founder, has written to account holders . Mr Hoare has written to customers warning them about the growing threats posed by hackers, writing: 'About three customers a week have their email accounts hacked, which is invariably inconvenient and sometimes very expensive. 'Criminals are routinely posturing as the bank to try to trick you out of your cards and passwords with the intent of stealing. 'They do this both online and in person, and if someone asks you for your card and PIN, it's not us!'","Account holders at C Hoare & Co, Britain's oldest private bank, hacked .

"By . Sam Creighton . A cocaine shipment bound for the Vatican has been seized by German law enforcement. Customs officers at Leipzig Airport found 340 grams of the Class A drug, valued at €40,000 (£33,470), stuffed into 14 condoms and hidden in a shipment of cushions coming from an unnamed South American country. The package was addressed simply to . the Vatican's postal office, meaning any of the Catholic mini-state's 800 . residents could have picked it up. The package was addressed to the Vatican's post office, so could have been for any of its 800 residents . A sting operation arranged with Vatican Police did not manage to lure in a possible recipient for the drugs. The bust was made in January but has just been revealed today by German newspaper, Bild am Sonntag. The investigation has been taken over by Interpol's Vatican office. The Vatican declined to comment on the incident and Interpol could not be reached. Interpol has five officers based in the world's smallest independent state and they are considered part of the Vatican City State Gendarmerie, the official police force, which has 130 staff in total. The specific roles of the Interpol officers are to target organised crime and any incidents which could impact international security. The Vatican's legal system is largely based on Italy's and, given that the city state has only one judge and no prisons, it often lets Italian courts administer justice when it is required. However, in 2007, the Vatican handed down its first ever drugs conviction when an employee of the Holy See was found in possession of a small amount of cocaine and was given a four month suspended sentence. The seized drugs, not pictured, have been valued at 40,000 Euros (£33,470), the investigation is ongoing .","The drugs were intercepted at Leipzig Airport and are valued at €40,000 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Pope Francis has hit out at Italian mobsters and warned them they will ‘end up in hell’ if they don’t change their ways and renounce their ‘blood-stained money and blood-stained power’. The pontiff made the stark warning following the death this week of two-year-old Domenico Petruzzelli, his mother Carla Maria Fornari and her partner Cosimo Orlando who were killed in a mob hit after assailants opened fire on their car. Pope Francis addressed the mobsters after a prayer vigil at a Roman church for relatives of innocent people killed by the mafia, during which the names of 842 victims were read aloud. Pope Francis, pictured in Saint Peter Basilica, Vatican, in January, warned Italian mobsters they will go to hell if they don't change their ways and renounce their 'blood-stained money and blood-stained power' After voicing his solidarity with the family members, Francis said he couldn’t leave the service without speaking to those not present: the ‘protagonists’ of mafia violence. Addressing the absentee mafiosi, Francis said: ‘This life that you live now won’t give you pleasure. It won’t give you joy or happiness. ‘Blood-stained money, blood-stained power, you can’t bring it with you to your next life. Repent. ‘There’s still time to not end up in hell, which is what awaits you if you continue on this path.’ Francis has spoken out frequently about the evils of corruption and wrote a short booklet on corruption and sin in 2005 when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires. But this was his first major address to Italian victims of organised crime, who were gathering near Rome for an annual retreat organised by a mafia-fighting priest that takes place annually on March 21. The pontiff even mentioned this week’s tragic hit, which occurred in Palagiano, near Taranto, in the southern Italian region of Puglia, during his address. Cosimo Orlando, 43, left, his partner Carla Maria Fornari, 30, centre, and her son Domenico, right, were killed instantly after hitmen forced their car off the road and then opened fire with machine guns in Palagiano, near Taranto, in the southern Italian region of Puglia, earlier this week . Mafia hitmen shot dead convicted mobster Cosimo Orlando, 43, his girlfriend and her two-year-old son after forcing them off the road in high speed chase . ‘You had a father, a mother. Think of them,’ he said. ‘Weep a little. And convert yourselves.’ Target Cosimo Orlando, 43, his partner Carla Maria Fornari, 30, and her son Domenico, were killed instantly after hitmen forced their car off the road and then opened fire with machine guns riddling it with bullets - amazingly Domenico’s two older brothers, sitting in the backseat, escaped unharmed. All three were killed instantly in the hit which happened late on Monday night and apart from the two children - who are now in police protection - there were no witnesses. A police spokesman said: 'This was a massacre, simple as that. The child stood no chance and was killed instantly along with his mother and Orlando. ‘We are investigating all possibilities - . although we believe that Orlando was probably the intended target we . have to remember that his partner was also married to a murdered . criminal. Amazingly two other children inside the car survived the incident which happened late on Monday night. Police said other than the two youngsters - who are now in police protection - there were no witnesses . 'There could be several motives revenge or drugs both Orlando and Petruzzelli had connections to drugs trafficking and they were both involved with organised crime. 'The only witnesses are the two children who are in a secret location with police and hopefully they will be able to give us some clues.' Mrs Fornari’s first husband and father of the three children, Domenico Petruzzelli, was a known mobster who was murdered three years ago. It is not the first time that children have been innocent victims as a result of mob hits - earlier this year another three-year-old boy was murdered after gunmen targeted a car he was travelling in killing two men as well.","Pope Francis issued the stark warning during prayer vigil for Mafia victims .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Traditional families with married parents and two children are a thing of the past and 'patchwork' families should be celebrated, a leading Catholic theologian has claimed. Werner Jeanrond, a former pupil of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, said the Church must drop 'moralising statements' about the ideal family set-up and embrace single working parents. His words come as the Coalition announced tax breaks for working mothers worth up to £2,000 a year for every child under 12. Embrace alternatives: Professor Jeanrond claims the 'idol' of married parents with two children is a construct of the industrialised West . Change: Professor Werner Jeanrond claims the early Church would not recognise 'traditional' family units . The state-backed childcare package . released in last week's Budget came under fire from Tory MPs claiming . 'traditional families' with a stay-at-home parent are put at a . disadvantage. But Professor . Jeanrond, Master of St Benet's Hall at the University of Oxford, . welcomed the idea of a broader definition of 'family'. He branded nuclear families 'an idol of the modern industrialised west', which the early Church would find bizarre. 'Biblical . concepts of the family often transcend biological considerations and . refer to larger households which can include relatives of different . degrees, an intergenerational community, visitors, and . workers/helpers/slaves,' he told MailOnline. 'All . too often the increasing numbers of people who live alone are not at . all present in the — at times — too many and too much moralising . statements on the 'Christian' family.' He added: 'Our so-called patchwork families ought to be of interest to a Church so used to changing concepts of family. 'It . is the attention to Jesus Christ that unites a Christian family, not . the adherence to shifting codifications of its boundary.' Professor Jeanrond is Master of St Benet's Hall, University of Oxford, which has just decided to admit female undergraduates, and is a former pupil of Pope Benedict, who many say left an overlooked progressive legacy . Laura Perrins, of campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘It’s a disgrace that taxpayers’ money will be used to contribute to the childcare bill of families earning up to £300,000. The Old Etonians need to take a trip to reality street.’ The Government insisted it is taking various steps to provide support for stay-at-home parents – including a new universal state pension crediting years spent caring for children and a transferable marriage tax allowance to be introduced from next year. But that will be worth just £200 a year, to the dismay of Tory critics. Former children’s minister Tim Loughton said: ‘The state is disproportionately geared up to pushing parents into being working parents.’","Werner Jeanrond, a Pope Benedict pupil, tells Church to embrace change .

"By . Dan Bloom . A tatty flat which only has 12 years left on its lease and needs a full refurbishment has been put up for sale - for almost £2million. The two-bedroom flat is on the south-west corner of Mayfair's Grosvenor Square, the most expensive square in London. It boasts two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, reception room, guest cloakroom and balcony - but is in desperate need of a full refurbishment which would cost around £1.5million. Tatty: It doesn't look like a £2million flat - but this living room is in Grosvenor Square, London's priciest . Who would live in a flat like this? The property is decorated in pale blue and the bathroom needs serious work . Location, location, location: Estate agents say the 'ultra-prime' flat could be brought up to scratch for £5m . Anyone interested in buying the 1950s property would also need to spend around £2.7million extending the lease to 90 years. Despite this, the flat - which measures 1,528 sq/ft - is still being offered with an asking price of 'just' £1.95 million. Big plans: A blueprint of the property . This is more than ten times the average £167,000 price paid for a home in England and Wales last month. The buyer would also have to pay a £50 annual ground rent and £16,767 service charge for the flat, which has a 24-hour porter and underground car parking space. Upmarket estate agents Knight Frank and Wetherell are advising on the flat - and say they have been inundated with interest. The flat is above a restaurant owned . by the billionaire businessman Richard Caring's and near some of the . world's most expensive homes and opulent embassies. Estate . agent Peter Wetherell said: 'This flat in Grosvenor Square is priced at . just £1.95million which is well below the average for Mayfair and . reflects the short lease. 'However . for the adroit investor, there is the potential for substantial capital . value uplift and profit once the apartment is transformed into an . ultra-prime residence. 'For . an outlay of up to £5million the apartment could be transformed into a . highly desirable ultra-prime residence on a long lease.' Prestigious: The flat in this building in Mayfair's Grosvenor Square has a 24-hour porter and parking space . Leafy: The square is the most expensive to buy property on in central London, where the market is booming . Entrance: The hallway of the building, which bills residents a service charge of almost £17,000 a year . House prices in Britain have risen 9.4 per cent in the last year, according to latest figures, fuelling fears of a housing bubble. London has been affected far more, with prices surging almost 15 per cent. Experts have warned the capital's market is being squeezed by a rush towards luxurious towers and flats which cater to the super-rich. Last summer an estate agents' network, London Property Partners, revealed it had sold 85 per cent of its homes in the previous year to overseas buyers as others were priced out of the market.","Two-bedroom flat is in Grosvenor Square, London's most expensive .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A bog-standard public toilet is set to be transformed into a luxury apartment after it sold for more than eight times the expected price. The disused loo in Reading, Berkshire, attracted more than 80 viewings and the successful bidder snapped it up for £85,000. Built in the 1930s, the former public convenience was listed at £10,000 before it went under the hammer in the village of Binfield, near Bracknell. As property prices continue to soar, dozens of buyers flush with cash have been competing for a bog-standard public toilet which has now sold for £85,000 - more than eight times the expected price . It was listed at £10,000 before being sold to an anonymous phone bidder. The project includes replacing the steel bar security gate with panelled doors fitted with fanlights, and replacing the timber windows to reduce the noise levels from the busy main road. Councils have been cashing in on the property boom round the UK by selling off old and dilapidated public loos. Many have been refurbished and turned into properties worth hundreds of thousands of pounds - some have even been converted into hairdressers and florists. This toilet in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, sold at auction for £100,000 . Developer Tony Thorpe, of Tony Thorpe Associates in Tilehurst, insisted the plans for the Reading loo will preserve the character of the building. He added: 'The purchaser is a local man who spotted a development opportunity and took it. 'It will be a unique living experience since all the windows are high-level and there are no direct views in or out of the building.' Last month a toilet in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, sold at auction for £100,000. The . brickbuilt structure was used as a public convenience up until 2012 . when it was closed as part of a cost-cutting review by Derbyshire Dales . District Council.

"By . Sam Creighton . With two double bedrooms, a large garden and planning permission for an extension, you might think £320,000 would be a bargain for a 'quaint' Surrey cottage. However, this house in Addlestone gives more the impression of long term project than family home, complete with rusty cars and a caravan hidden somewhere in its jungle of a back yard. Despite this, in the increasingly competitive housing market, its enterprising owner was able to bump up the asking price from the original £299,950 and still attract an offer good enough for them to have stopped further viewings. The garden of the property has become completely overgrown and is strewn with abandoned vehicles . An online advert for the property, which has drummed up an offer, despite its poorly maintained state . In their online advert, property agents Townends say potential buyers have 'a rare and unique opportunity to purchase this quaint cottage set within the ever popular Poets Corner development'. The estate agents, who have been listing the property since October 2013, admit that it requires 'heavy refurbishment' but insist it is a 'real blank canvas' for people who want to put 'their own stamp on a property'. The home is also being advertised by agents Gascoigne-Pees, who uploaded their advert on March 1. This advert mentions that the house has planning permission for an extension - however, it is not known whether this is in fact the case. The sole photo of the inside of the property can, at best, be described as austere, with bare white walls and floor boards covered with worn-looking rugs. However, it does offer a glimpse of what appears to be an original Victorian fireplace. The property is described be estate agents as a 'blank canvas' and an 'opportunity' for potential buyers . Weeds have taken over the garden but the house is on a large plot that may have permission for an extension . The internal photograph of the house paints an austere picture. Agents accept it needs 'modernisation' Gascoigne-Pees, whose advert this internal photo is attached to, warn potential viewers that the property is in 'need of modernisation throughout'. The garden is the most striking part of this property. Most prospective sellers spend thousands doing up their homes, hoping to claim the money back by being able to charge more for a spick and span property. However, the owners of this cottage have let weeds run rampant in the garden and the plants seem to have claimed a VW Beetle and several motorhomes - seemingly abandoned outside - as their own. The owners have been trying to sell the property since, at least, October and have now received an offer . The property originally went on the market for £299,950 but the asking price was bumped up to £320,000 . Alex Gosling, managing director of online estate agents Housesimple.co.uk, told the Daily Star Sunday: 'I do find it amazing that the agents don't politely suggest that the vendor spends a weekend clearing that lot up.' While it is unknown how much the owner has been offered for the cottage, the average selling price for similar, nearby properties is £305,000. Both Gascoigne-Pees and Townends were unavailable for comment last night.","House in Addlestone, Surrey originally had an asking price of £299,950 .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . The inferno that killed four people and injured eight as it burned an iconic Jersey Shore motel to the ground Friday was caused by a cigarette tossed into a chair, authorities said. A cigarette discarded into a chair in a designated smoking area at the Mariner's Cove Inn, a two-story motel in the family resort town of Point Pleasant Beach, is what caused the deadly inferno, officials said. They do not know who is to blame. The announcement came two days after officials announced Saturday that DNA testing will be needed to identify the four people burned to death in the fire. Occupants were staying there after Superstorm Sandy had washed away their homes. Smoking kills: Investigators look through the rubble of the Mariner's Cove Inn, in Point Pleasant Beach N.J., on Saturday, they have since announced that a cigarette is the likely cause of the blaze . Fire investigators said they do not believe the fire was started intentionally, and are not sure if one of the four people charred to death in the resulting blaze is to blame They may never find the culprit, but were quick to say the investigation is only beginning. 'This is only the beginning of an . intensive investigation aimed at answering the many questions . surrounding all the circumstances that contributed to the tragic deaths, . injuries and loss of property,' a fire official said. The announcement came only one day after it was announced that the remains of the four people killed in the inferno will need to be identified using DNA testing. The early Friday morning blaze also injured eight others. An additional 10 people originally declared missing have since been found. Officials weren't ruling out the possibility that the 10 had escaped before the fire engulfed the Mariner's Cove Motor Inn in this popular summer resort town at around 5.30 a.m. All the missing occupants have now been accounted for and 9 of them are safe. The wooden building was overwhelmed by flames by the time firefighters arrived, and at least one person leaped from a second-floor window to escape. Three people were injured critically. Investigators interviewed motel management, and determined about 40 people were staying there when the fire broke out, Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato said. The motel's office was destroyed and many records were lost, he said, making an accurate accounting difficult. Raging: The out-of-control blaze burned the motel to the ground and took yet another home away from dozens staying there since Superstorm Sandy washed their houses away . Now just a memory: The shabby motel had long hosted families seeking a cheap place to stay for their weekends near the beach and boardwalk in the seaside town about one hour south of New York City . Firefighters investigate an early morning fire at the Mariner's Cove Hotel in Point Pleasant Beach . Coronato said authorities hope the . missing hotel occupants had simply gone elsewhere to stay with . relatives, or to another motel, and asked them to check in with police. 'We are trying to make sure they are safe and unharmed,' he said. Survivors described a chaotic scene of flames, smoke and screaming. Peter . Kuch said he smelled smoke and opened his door to find a lounge area . engulfed in flames. He dialed 911 to seek help, and by the time the call . was completed, the flames were at his door and licking at the windows . of his second-floor unit. He decided to jump. 'I . had to, there was no other way out,' he said. 'My window was only open . an inch and flames were already starting to come through it. There just . was no other choice.' Yet another tragedy down the shore: This fire happens only months after another fire burned down the famous Seaside Heights boardwalk, and many of the same fire investigators who worked that blaze are on the scene of this one . He suffered a sprained ankle but said he was otherwise all right. Joe . Frystock was one of the Sandy victims who was staying at the motel, . which like many others in this normally quiet resort town about 70 miles south of New York City, relies on people seeking low-cost . rentals during the slow winter season. His home in nearby Brick . Township took on 6 feet of water during the October 2012 storm, and the . motel was the latest in a series of temporary homes for him. Frystock, . who is diabetic, said he frequently has to use the bathroom at night. He woke up to popping sounds, which he initially thought was gunfire. 'It was the sound of timbers burning . upstairs' he said. 'I looked out and saw that orange glow, and there . was no mistaking what it was. People were yelling: 'Help me! Help me!' There was lots of screaming. The fire decimated the motel leaving nothing but crumbling remains behind . A woman in the unit next to me, they pulled . her from a bathtub, but I don't know how anyone could have survived . those flames. The entire second floor was engulfed, from one end to . another.' That woman, who . had sought refuge in a shower and kept the water running while waiting . to be rescued, was pulled from the bathroom by one firefighter, who . handed her out a window to another firefighter, who carried her down a . ladder to safety. The woman was taken to St. Barnabas Medical Center, a . hospital about an hour north that specializes in treating severe burns, . which Coronato said she had suffered. Denise Dougherty, the motel's housekeeper, said she was awakened by screams. 'There were people yelling, 'Help me! Help me!' and other people yelling, 'Jump! Jump!' It was terrible.' Shawn Wardell said a strong wind . was fanning the flames across the second floor of the motel, where he . had been staying with his cousin and grandparents. 'We . got my grandfather out 'cause he's disabled, and by that time the whole . second floor was just engulfed in flames,' he said. 'People were . yelling and screaming.' The Jersey shore motel was housing residents including Superstorm Sandy victims whose homes were destroyed . Investigators are currently    interviewing motel management to determine how many people were staying there when the fire broke out . Residents . gave conflicting accounts of whether they heard smoke detectors or fire . alarms sounding. Some said they heard nothing, while others said a fire . alarm was blaring as the flames were sweeping eastward across the top . of the building. Authorities did not immediately identify the dead. Coronato said all three males. The . Ocean County Sheriff's Department said one of the injured included one . of its detectives, who suffered a severe leg injury, including broken . bones, at the fire scene. The motel fire came only six months after a September blaze burned down part of the Seaside Heights boardwalk - which had been newly-rebuilt after also being washed away by the monster storm. Many of the same fire investigators who worked the boardwalk blaze were on the scene of the motel fire.","Fire investigators said Monday the fire was started by a cigarette 'carelessly discarded into a stuffed chair' in a common area .

"Penny-pinching Britons spend an average of just £12 on their mums on Mothers' Day, a survey has revealed. Mothers in Liverpool have the most to look forward to on Mothering Sunday - more than £50 being spent on their card and present compared to the UK average. But children in Southampton and Sheffield are the least generous with around £6 being spent on their presents for mum. Show her you care: Mothers in Liverpool can expect the most generous presents this Sunday according to new research on Mother's Day gifting . Mother's think that children spend 30 per cent less on Mother's Day compared to Father's Day. This is mainly due to mums not wanting material gifts, backed up by the survey which shows that mums claiming that the best gift for mothers day is a thoughtful card (29 per cent), a favourable bunch of flowers (15 per cent) and a nice lunch out (12 per cent). The survey of almost 2,000 mums actually found that all most of them want for Mothering Sunday is to spend time with their children (47 per cent), or be pampered by having a lie-in (30 per cent), being treated to breakfast in bed (26 per cent) or having an uninterrupted soak in the bath (18 per cent). Size matters: 'You shouldn't have darling' coupled with an expression like this really means 'where's the rest of it?' But nearly half (49 per cent) of mums expect their partner to indulge them too. A . spokesperson for Cussons Mum & Me, which carried out the survey, . said: 'It's interesting to see what presents mums would like for . Mother's Day and what people spend, but all mums really want is a bit of . time to relax and be spoiled and this needn't cost the earth.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A Subway worker who used a bread oven to dry her wet socks and gloves has become the centre of an internal investigation after she posted a picture of her carrying out the unhygienic act on her Instagram page. Alice Sykes, 25, uploaded the picture of her soggy clothes – a pair of purple socks and dark gloves – laid out on the heated metal racks which are used to cook bread. Alongside the photo, she wrote: ‘Socks and gloves drying in the oven at work ha #Worcester #floods #wet #gloves #socks.' Subway worker Alice Sykes, 25, laid out her wet purple socks and soggy gloves on the metal heated racks normally used to cook bread at the Subway store in the St John's area of Worcester . Alice Sykes, 25, pictured, posted a photograph of her wet socks and gloves on the bread oven at the Subway store on her Twitter and Instagram pages . However, the image was removed after Jessica Hinton, a regular customer at the Subway store in the St John’s area of Worcester, spotted the image online and complained. The 29-year-old office cleaner was offered vouchers by way of an apology by the store manager, who called her the next day. She was also private messaged on Facebook by Miss Sykes - who apologised and said her boss ‘didn’t think it fair I have wet feet for a nine-hour shift’. Miss Sykes, of Worcester, attempted to justify her actions by saying it was ‘one off thing’ and insisted the oven was cleaned after her socks had dried off. In a Facebook exchange between herself and Miss Hinton, she wrote: ‘Hello. I just wanted to talk to you. ‘I understand that you have put a complaint in regarding some socks in the subway oven. The Subway worker posted a photograph of the unhygienic act on her Instagram page, pictured, with the caption: 'Socks and gloves drying in the oven at work ha #Worcester #floods #wet #gloves #socks' Subway worker Sykes, 25, posted a series of messages to customer Jessica Hinton after her boss allegedly told her to apologise or face losing her job . ‘There wasn't much thought put into it at the time but it was around the time of the floods. ‘I had a nine hour shift ahead of me and my boss didn't think it was fair I was soaking wet the entire shift. ‘The entire oven was cleaned afterwards as well. I apologize (sic) for any offense this has caused you. ‘It was a one off thing that thought wasn't put into. But we strive to have a clean store every single day. ‘We have monthly inspections to prove that me and my boss are very sorry about the whole thing and we hope you accept the vouchers. ‘Anyway I (am) really sorry about the whole thing, me and my boss aren't nasty people. ‘We regret doing it. Nothing else ever happens in our store. It's always clean and tidy and a happy environment to be in for both customers and staff. Sorry for upsetting you.‘Had to apologize (sic) for being a prized c*** ha.’ Mother-of-one Jessica Hinton said the messages from Alice Sykes, pictured, were bordering on harassment . Andrea Fleck, development agent for the Subway brand in Worcestershire, said: 'We are in the process of investigating the facts at this particular franchise. The Subway brand takes food and product safety extremely seriously' However, mother-of-one Miss Hinton, wasn’t satisfied with the apology and declined the vouchers offered to her before going into the store to speak to the manager in person - who said the worker was made to apologise or face losing her job. Bizarrely, the boss then offered the angry customer a Sunday job and two free six-inch sandwiches. Miss Hinton said: ‘I spotted the picture last month during the floods and thought it wasn't on so complained. ‘I waited for ages for someone from Subway to get back to me and the day after I threatened to go to my local paper the manager called me. Miss Sykes, of Worcester, attempted to justify her actions saying it was 'one off thing' and insisted the oven was cleaned after her socks had dried off . ‘And then Alice started private messaging me on Facebook apologising. It was borderline harassment. ‘But she didn't take the picture down from Instagram so I went to the store to see the manager and said she obviously can't be sorry. ‘He apologised and said she was made to take it down and apologise. ‘I have nothing against Subway, me and my son Coby used to go in there all the time for a sandwich. ‘But I won't be going in that store again, it was just so unhygienic.’ Miss Sykes, who still works at the Subway store, refused to comment.

"By . Bianca London . Different regions of the country have very alternative ways of expressing their feelings, according to a new study. London is the flower capital of the UK, with over a third of Londoners having bought their partner a bouquet in the past year to maintain a blossoming relationship. The Scots put faith in their loved . one's sweet tooth: 29 per cent have surprised a partner with the reliable chocolate box gesture in the last year. Frisky Welsh: While Londoners say 'I love you' with a romantic gesture such as flowers, the people of Wales prefer to get under the covers . In Northern Ireland, the failsafe romantic meal is favoured by over two fifths, who have cooked a gourmet dinner as a way of showing affection towards their other half.

A Norwegian F-16 fighter pilot has taken one of the most ice-cool photos of all time - in the middle of a mock dogfight. The airman was in the skies above Troms, Norway, taking part in a winter exercise which involved hundreds of jets when he turned his camera on his own face.

The image was released by the Norwegian Armed Forces and was one of several taken by pilots on the exercise. It comes weeks after another fighter pilot in Denmark snapped himself while being photobombed by a missile he had just fired. The spectacular picture captured the moment the sidewinder roared past him in the background, with its rocket burning brightly, as the Danish top gun flew an F-16 jet at hundreds of miles an hour.

"By . Emma Innes . Caitlin Gaylard, 12, has received compensation after a botched operation as a child left her unable to smile . A 12-year-old girl left unable to smile after surgeons severed a nerve during a botched operation been awarded compensation. Caitlin Gaylard developed a non-cancerous tumour on the right size of her neck shortly after her birth in 2002. The haemangioma rapidly grew to the size of a fist and she had to have an operation to remove the growth. But surgeons at University Hospital Wales, in Cardiff, severed the nerves in one side of her face during the operation, causing severe paralysis on the right side of her face. This left Caitlin, who lived in Magor, South Wales, without the ability to smile and despite attempts to correct the problem, the nerve couldn’t be repaired. Her parents Kim, 38, and Ian, 40, instructed lawyers at Irwin Mitchell who secured a full admission of responsibility from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. Yesterday at the Royal Courts of Justice in London the judge, Master Roberts, approved a settlement from the health board to fund Caitlin’s on-going treatment. The family, who now live in Houston, Texas, were initially seeking £100,000, although the final figure is undisclosed. Mr and Mrs Gaylard were initially told by doctors that Caitlin’s facial palsy would be temporary. But over time it became clear the nerve had been completely severed rather than damaged. They were told that the facial palsy could be corrected, but they would have to wait until Caitlin was older for the surgery. Shortly after her birth, Caitlin developed a large non-cancerous tumour on her neck. It was during surgery to remove it that a nerve in her face was severed . When she was four-and-a-half she had a nerve removed from her calf which was grafted onto the good nerve in her face. The second stage of the procedure was performed in 2009 but the surgery did not work. At a hearing last year, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board admitted full responsibility for failing to safeguard the seventh cranial nerve - the nerve which controls facial expression - before removal of the growth. They admitted severing the nerve during Caitlin’s operation and failing to carry out appropriate surgical treatment during the procedure to attempt to repair it. The hospital also failed to attempt . to repair the smiling nerve within reasonable time of discovering . Caitlin had developed facial palsy. Caitlin has had surgery to try and repair the damage but it was unsuccessful . Caitlin now has multiple scars on her face and body and has suffered bullying as a result of the facial palsy. The brave little girl has decided she will undergo another procedure to try and rectify the damage from her first operation and is hoping to have the operation next summer. Mrs Gaylard, a full-time mother, said: ‘I am in complete awe of my daughter and how much she has overcome in her short life. ‘She has really struggled through the years to come to terms with her facial palsy. ‘Facial palsy can be extremely isolating and while friends empathise, they can never truly understand the depth of emotion or effect it has on your life. ‘I think of the importance people place . on a smile, about her graduation photo, her wedding photo and all the . first impressions she will have to face in her future and my heart . breaks over and over. Caitlin is now considering having further surgery in a bid to enable her to smile . ‘As a family we have felt like we have been on a rollercoaster, so many ups and downs, but we are stronger because of it. ‘Caitlin is the bravest, kindest person I know and hopefully the next operation will work, but if it doesn’t I know she’ll pick herself up again and I’ll be right beside her every step of the way.’ There are around 100,000 in the UK who suffer from facial palsy with at least 30 different causes, according to the charity Facial Palsy UK. Julie Lewis, a partner and medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell, represented Caitlin’s family. She said: ‘We are pleased for Caitlin and her family that we have secured an admission of responsibility from the Health Board. University Hospital of Wales has accepted responsibility for the damage to Caitlin's facial nerves . ‘From such a young age, Caitlin has suffered a series of painful procedures and has bravely coped with facial disfigurement which the Board admits, could have been avoided. ‘Not only has Caitlin suffered from physical ailments, she has also endured many years of bullying at school due to her facial palsy which has been heart-breaking for her parents to see their daughter suffer at school amongst her peers. ‘The settlement will cover the cost of future medical treatment, future loss of earnings and the pain and suffering caused to Caitlin and we hope the Board will also offer the family an official apology given the severity of the impact the errors have had.’ A spokesman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: 'The health board is very sorry for what has happened and we would like to offer our sincere apologies to Caitlin and her family. 'The board accepted liability in this case shortly after receiving the claim and we are pleased that the legal process is now complete. 'We appreciate this settlement will never undo the harm caused but we hope it helps Caitlin and her family in some small way.'","Caitlin Gaylard developed a non-cancerous tumour on her neck as a baby .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer could be denied a new drug by the NHS rationing body. Radium-223 extends life by nearly four months and improves quality of life for men whose cancer has spread to the bones. In . the latest blow to men with prostate cancer, the National Institute for . Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has issued a draft decision not to recommend its use on the NHS in England and . Wales. The drug Radium-223 or Xofigo extends life by up to four months. A full course of the drug costs £24,000 but Bayer has agreed an NHS discount . Nice says Bayer, the manufacturer of Radium-223, has not . supplied data comparing it with another drug regime so cannot judge . whether it is cost-effective. But charities and cancer specialists . are outraged, saying it could take years for this ‘innovative’ agent to . be tested against other new drugs and it is a ‘kick in the teeth’ for . men who have run out of options. Around 10,500 British men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments. Nice . is also considering curbs on enzalutamide, which extends life by five . months, with some men living for 18 months. Radium-223 is an internal radiotherapy treatment for . prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and is not responding to . hormone therapy. Sir Andrew Dillon, Nice's chief executive said the organisation needed to be confident that the benefits would justify the cost . The monthly injection has been shown to extend . survival by an average of 3.6 months and delays the cancer getting into . the bones by 5.5 months. Because radium-223 is similar to calcium, it . is taken up by active bone cells and is therefore an effective way of . zapping bone cancer cells and raising quality of life with minimal side . effects. A course of treatment costs £24,000, although Bayer has . agreed an NHS discount with the Department of Health, which is . confidential. In the US, the drug also known as Xofigo was fast-tracked for approval last year because no alternative therapy was available. But . Nice says it was not possible to determine whether it could be . considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources, because comparison . data with the cancer drugs docetaxel and abiraterone had not been . presented by Bayer. Leading prostate cancer specialist Professor . Jonathan Waxman said Nice was imposing virtually impossible conditions . on the drug’s use despite accepting that it works. He said ‘Doing trials . to produce this data could bring delays of four, five or more years when . some men could be benefiting right now. ‘The FDA in the US is an . enlightened organisation that reached a rapid opinion which recognised . the need for men to have access to this drug if the cancer had gone to . their bones. ‘We need to cut back the power of Nice, this has been promised but nothing seems to happen.‘If this was a drug to treat breast cancer there would be an outcry’ he added. Mikis . Euripides, director of policy and strategy at Prostate Cancer UK said . ‘It’ s a terrible kick in the teeth for men facing their last months, . especially as other new treatments, such as enzalutamide, have . restrictions on use in England and Wales. ‘Unless the drug company provides the necessary evidence, men will be denied this safe and effective drug. ‘We . urge Bayer to submit everything required in the coming weeks before . NICE takes its final decision on this valuable treatment. Leading prostate cancer specialist Professor Jonathan Waxman said Nice was imposing virtually impossible conditions on the drug's use despite accepting that it works . ‘Men dying . of prostate cancer have so few options and to lose one that has already . been developed and is known to be effective is madness.’ Sir Andrew . Dillon, NICE Chief Executive, said ‘Bone metastases are very distressing . for patients and their families, particularly as a result of bone pain . and fatigue, which have a profound effect on patients’ quality of life, . by limiting their mobility and meaning full-time care would often be . needed for daily activities. ‘We know how important this could be to . patients and we are disappointed not to able to recommend this drug, but . we have to be confident that its benefits justify its considerable . cost.’ A Bayer spokesman said Xofigo was the first drug of its type . developed to treat advanced prostate cancer. He said it was trying . ‘to develop a new economic model using a measure of progression . appropriate to the innovative nature of Xofigo’ and would continue to . work with Nice. The Scottish Medicine Consortium (SMC) has yet to consider the drug for use in Scotland .","New prostate drug Radium-223 extends life by nearly four months .

"By . Sarah Hartley . Losing locks: Eight million British women suffer from hair loss or thinning hair at some point in their lives . It is pretty safe to say that my hair – namely, my worries about it thinning – is bordering on obsession. It’s a concern my mother, Maggie, shares. At 66, she is worried that her good head of healthy hair is now thinning  due to age. We’re not alone. Eight million British women suffer  at some point in their lives and chemists’ shelves heave with potions and vitamins aimed at remedying the problem. Causes can range from hormonal and genetic to the dietary and psychological. I am 41, and, despite being fastidious about eating healthily, exercising and taking a daily multivitamin, my  hair often falls out in alarming amounts. I swap the side I part my hair and try to ignore the fact that in certain lights, you can see scalp. When I heard about a medical spa offering a treatment package aimed at halting hair-loss, my mother and I booked in without hesitation. No matter that the weekend break would set us back close to £2,500. If I counted up the amount I have spent on hair supplements, then it would be an investment. It was a no-caffeine, no-alcohol,  no-sugar regime (and pity the poor smokers who were not allowed to puff on site). Serious medical assessments  were bolstered by a strict vegan diet to cleanse the system. But the SHA Wellness Clinic, set in the mountains of Valencia, Spain, has been voted best medical Spa by Conde Nast Traveller. The luxurious resort has played host  to guests including Barbra Streisand and Donna Karan. So if we were to suffer, we would at least do it in style. WHAT’S THE TREATMENT? SHA focuses on improving health through natural therapies combined with Eastern and the most advanced Western medicine. The weekend programme examined every aspect of our medical history and there was a health check, then individual spa treatments. We were put on a macrobiotic diet – based on 60 per cent grains, plus seasonal local vegetables, seaweeds (yes!) and seasonal local fruit. We enjoyed delicious, delicate and stunning-looking dishes which made us realise brown rice, soya and tofu can be exciting and we could forgo meat, fish, eggs and cheese without it feeling a punishment. Hair-raising in a good way: Sarah Hartley and her mother Maggie visited SHA Wellness Clinic in Valencia, Spain to try to reverse age's effect on their hair . But cutting out three double espressos and two cups of tea a day was hell. When I woke, I looked as if I’d done rounds in the boxing ring – my eyes were puffed  up and blackened – all part of the detoxification process, I was told. Nutrition expert Kenneth Prange asked if I suffered with kidney problems (yes) and poor circulation (yes). I spotted a chart on the wall of a woman’s face indicating related areas. Mum and I are both blessed with bags beneath our eyes – not related to sleep deprivation – and that area was linked to .  .  . the kidneys. The solution is to stimulate and strengthen the kidneys through diet and to make sure blood flows to the head through massage and exercise. A daily cup of Japanese Mu tea was prescribed  to support the kidneys. It had an acquired bitter taste which we grew to love as it was the nearest thing we would get to a nice cuppa. Mum was reassured that  due to genetics her hair is strong, but could be improved. SPA SOLUTIONS . A . daily programme offered optional nutritional lectures and macrobiotic . cooking demonstrations. We were to swim in the outdoor pool, then follow . the indoor pool circuit which encouraged circulation with hot and cold . plunge pools, baths, a sauna, a steam room and an ice fountain. We had two daily treatments, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, either side of breakfast and lunch. Healthy home: The SHA Wellness Clinic follows a no-caffeine, no-alcohol, no-sugar regime and medical assessments were bolstered by a strict vegan diet . The first was a nutritive capillary treatment (25 minutes, €70), including nourishing, repairing and hydrating treatments. Using Ayurvedic massage, essential oils were vigorously applied to stimulate the scalp. We felt wide awake and invigorated. In the afternoon came the SHA capillary treatment (50 minutes, €120). It started with a relaxing massage using rosemary, mint and sesame oil to increase blood flow to the scalp and included massage techniques based on traditional Chinese medicine, aided with a glass-cup method which stimulates blood circulation. We finished with a relaxing, warm hair masque. SHA offers an extraordinary range of preventative treatments with 100 therapists  on hand. We could also have tried a ‘mineral elements in hair profile’ (€200), a ‘woman’s hormonal profile’ (€340) or the OSTEOgen (€630) genetic screening for osteoporosis prevention. . . . AND AFTERWARDS . We both followed a macrobiotic diet for three months and felt tremendous. It requires serious dedication long-term. But the essence of the programme remains with us both, which has been a surprise. I now drink only green tea and have turned vegan, and Mum limits meat to once a week. We’re now both big fans of almond milk and spelt bread. Our hair has responded brilliantly to what turned out to be simple adjustments and it was well worth the effort. We no longer fret if the plughole occasionally looks like a scene from a horror film. We simply step up the scalp self-massage and neck exercises we were taught, keep the diet in check – and talk about our next booster visit to SHA. shawellnessclinic.com .","The SHA Wellness Clinic in Spain vows to help you strengthen your locks .

"By . Emma Innes . A couple whose baby was stillborn have spoken of their ‘horrendous ordeal’ after a hospital admitted she would have lived if it was not for a series of blunders. Deborah and Richard Horners' daughter Abbie was delivered stillborn on August 17 2011 following an emergency C-section. The couple say their baby cannot be brought back but that if the hospital were to apologise and learn from the mistakes then they would be able to move on with their lives. Richard and Deborah Horners' baby, Abbie, was stillborn as a result of a catalogue of errors at St James's University Hospital in Leeds . The NHS trust which runs St James’s . University Hospital in Leeds has admitted liability and agreed an . undisclosed settlement with the family. According to the family’s lawyers, an investigation found that Abbie’s death was caused by a catalogue of errors and poor communication by medics which led to her brain being starved of oxygen. The midwife in charge of Mrs Horner’s care was referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council and given a 12-month suspension order, the lawyers said. She has now retired. ‘To this day we are still shocked and appalled by what we went through and the tragic loss of our daughter Abbie,’ said Mrs Horner, 46, who lives in north Leeds. ‘To know that our baby would have been born healthy had it not been for the failures to report her abnormal heartbeat is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. ‘Everyone makes mistakes but there are lives at stake and my baby deserved the best possible care but, sadly, both she and I were failed.’ Abbie was delivered by emergency C-section but she had suffered catastrophic brain damage . Mrs Horner added: ‘My family have not even received an apology despite the trust’s admission. This is just shocking and has left us very angry. ‘It is just beyond belief how you could treat someone like that. ‘We never want anyone else to have to suffer the same heartache we did, and although we know the trust said improvements would be made immediately, we want to see proof of this. ‘Nothing will ever bring our daughter back but if they can apologise and prove that lessons have been learnt and shared across the NHS then hopefully we can start to put this horrendous ordeal behind us and try and re-build our lives.’ Kelly Morris, a lawyer at Irwin Mitchell who represents the couple, said Abbie’s death was completely avoidable. She explained how Mrs Horner’s pregnancy was considered high risk as she was 43-years-old and had previously suffered a miscarriage, yet no delivery or induction plan was agreed for her. Ms Morris said an internal investigation into the midwife in charge’s actions found breaches including the misinterpretation of the foetal heart trace, inadequate and inaccurate record keeping, failure to keep mother and baby the focus of care and failure to act within trust guidance. Ms Morris said: ‘The loss of baby Abbie has truly devastated Deborah and Richard because she should still be alive today. ‘Despite having the technology to identify when a baby’s heartbeat is irregular or weak through the CTG machine, changes on the monitor were not reported correctly for a period of eight hours which prevented the appropriate action, such as an emergency caesarean, being taken sooner. ‘This meant that Abbie suffered catastrophic brain damage. ‘We welcome the fact the trust has admitted responsibility for the failings but it is concerning that Deborah and Richard have not had an apology for their loss. ‘Abbie’s death was completely avoidable and we hope that the action plan drawn up by the trust has been shared throughout the NHS to ensure the same mistakes are not repeated and patient safety is protected.’ Julian Hartley, Chief Executive of Leeds . Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘The events leading up to the loss . of Abbie fell far short of the high standards of care we normally . provide and for this I am very sorry. ‘A full investigation led by a senior . doctor was undertaken into the failure to recognise and escalate . concerns in the labour care. ‘This . report has been shared with Mr and Mrs Horner and I can reassure them . that we are committed to using this to ensure we learn from every aspect . of what happened. The hospital has accepted liability for Abbie's death and has agreed an undisclosed settlement with the family . ‘Quite rightly our clinical staff have to be accountable for their actions.’ Mr Hartley said the midwife concerned was immediately removed from practice and referred to the Local Supervisory Authority Midwifery Officer. He said she subsequently chose to retire and is no longer employed by the trust. He said: ‘In 2012, our head of midwifery and lead consultant met personally with Mr and Mrs Horner to discuss their concerns and to express their profound condolences and apologies. ‘I am very sad to hear that Mr and Mrs Horner feel they have not had an apology from the trust, as we have done our best to provide this. ‘As chief executive I would like to reiterate how sorry I am on behalf of everyone concerned in this tragic case.’","Deborah and Richard Horner's baby, Abbie, died in August 2011 .

"By . Shari Miller . Some restaurant atmospheres are plain dead - but one Indian restaurant owner claims business has flourished since opening his eaterie at the site of an old cemetery. Rather than ripping out the graves to make way for his restaurant, owner Krishnan Kutti even chose to preserve the coffins and place tables around them at the ironically-named New Lucky Restaurant in Ahmadabad. The coffins are the remnants of a Muslim cemetery and the cafe has now become a popular hang-out for both young and old. Flourishing: Krishnan Kutti, owner of New Lucky Restaurant in Ahmadabad, India, claims business is brisk since opening his cafe at the site of an old cemetery . Unique: The New Lucky Restaurant promises a different experience for its customers . Kutti said: 'The graveyard brings good luck. Our business has been flourishing because of these graves. It gives people a unique experience. 'We have maintained the graves as they were. Our customers don't seem to mind.' However, the owner has little idea who the graves belong to, while some locals claim they contain the remains of followers of a 16th-Century Sufi saint, whose tomb lies nearby. Around a dozen graves lay inside the restaurant and have been sealed off by iron grills. Every morning, when the shutters of the restaurant are pulled up, waiters spend some time wiping the gravestones and decorating them with fresh flowers. 'We begin our day by paying respects to the graves. 'We wipe them and cover them with cloth and also shower flowers on them. 'It is important to respect the dead,' said Kutti. Preserved: Owner Krishnan Kutti decided to place tables around the graves rather than disturb them . Mind your step: Customers have to negotiate their way around the coffins to the tables .

"By . Ben Spencer . Professor Sir Rory Collins said studies had created 'misleading uncertainty' over statins . Doctors are putting lives at risk by exaggerating the side effects of statins, an expert warns. Professor Sir Rory Collins said recent studies had created 'misleading uncertainty' about the drugs. He claimed unjustified concerns about side effects meant statins were not being prescribed enough, possibly causing more deaths than the MMR scandal. But critics accused him of 'fear-mongering', and said it was important for patients to be warned about the potential dangers. More than seven million Britons with . high cholesterol take statins to cut the risk of heart attacks and . strokes. The NHS says the drugs save 7,000 lives a year. Proposed changes to prescription guidelines mean they could soon be prescribed to 12million patients. But . two recent articles in the British Medical Journal have claimed statins . cause harmful side effects, and do not necessarily reduce mortality. Professor . Collins, of Oxford University, said the papers by John Abramson, from . Harvard Medical School, and British cardiologist Aseem Malhotra were . misleading. He added: 'Statins are given to people at elevated risk of heart attacks and strokes. 'If . people at elevated risk stop taking their statins – or don't start . taking their statins – then they will have unnecessary heart attacks and . strokes, there will be unnecessary deaths from vascular causes. This is . a serious disservice to medicine.' He said the uncertainty over statins . was more serious than the MMR scare, when a researcher claimed the jabs . could cause autism, leading to many parents refusing to have their . children vaccinated. He added: 'The papers are far worse in . terms of the harm they have done, and [the uncertainty] is probably . killing more people... than that on the MMR vaccine.' BMJ editor Dr . Fiona Godlee said the articles were well referenced and peer reviewed, . and insisted that significant medical issues deserved to be debated . openly. (Stock picture) More than seven million Britons with high cholesterol take statins to cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes . She added: 'It's . important that the public understand when we're talking about extending . statins to people at low risk, that the balance between benefits and . harms becomes much more important.' Statins are offered to those with a 20 per cent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next ten years. But following a study by Professor Collins, health chiefs recommended in February that they should be given to those with a 10 per cent risk. But critics say over-prescribing to low-risk patients could lead to muscle weakness, kidney problems, diabetes and depression. Dr Abramson said his study showed statins did not cut deaths by much, adding: 'Dr Collins is fear-mongering when he says lives will be lost as a result of our calculations.' Aseem Malhotra, of Croydon University Hospital in South London, said pills were a poor substitute for a good diet and more exercise. But analysis at Imperial College London of 29 trials of statins involving more than 80,000 people said the drugs had almost no side effects. Statins could ease the symptoms of lung- disease patients, researchers said last night. They found the drugs could be an alternative to long-term antibiotic treatment for those with chronic lung problems. Although statins are prescribed for people at risk of heart attack, they also have anti-inflammatory properties. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh gave the drugs to patients with a lung condition known as bronchiectasis. The life-threatening and disabling disease affects one in 1,000 adults, leading to inflammation in the lungs and airways that causes debilitating coughing fits and chest infections. The team found a high daily dose of statins over six months reduced the amount of coughing for 12 out of the 30 patients in the study. Patients could also better tolerate gentle exercise and walk further than before, and had fewer flare-ups of the disease and less inflammation in their airways. Six stopped taking statins before the study ended because of side effects such as headaches, but there were no serious adverse reactions. The findings, published today in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine, suggest statins could offer an alternative to long-term antibiotic treatment, which raises the risk of infection from antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria such as MRSA or clostridium difficile. The cause of bronchiectasis is not known for most patients, but it has been linked to infections such as whooping cough and pneumonia. Study leader Dr Pallavi Mandal said: 'There are few effective treatments for bronchiectasis, so these are encouraging findings. Larger studies are needed to find out whether statins could be useful as a long-term treatment for patients.'","Sir Rory Collins said studies had created 'misleading uncertainty'

"By . Emma Innes . Hospital managers have apologised to the family of a 34st man who died after doctors delayed giving him a potentially life-saving scan - because he was too fat for their machine. Lee Perry, 26, was admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary with suspected inflammation of the spine on November 6, 2012. He was suffering from sporadic numbness in his legs and was struggling to walk. Lee Perry (pictured with his mother, Angela) died after a potentially life-saving MRI scan was delayed because he was too big to fit in the hospital's MRI scanner . He was booked in for an MRI scan to confirm the diagnosis and to detect signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but it was ruled he was too large for the machine. Doctors even called zoos and an equine centre to see if they had a big enough scanner which could be used - but they were not available. While waiting for a scan in hospital, Mr Perry, a carer from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, developed DVT and on November 29 he died of a pulmonary embolism - a blood clot on the lungs. Tragically, he was due to finally undergo an MRI scan the day after his death. His heartbroken family lodged a formal complaint with the hospital and NHS chiefs apologised for their treatment of Mr Perry. His mother Angela Scrase, 54, believes he could have survived if he had had better care at the hospital and they had been better prepared to treat a morbidly obese patient. Mr Perry, 26, weighed 34st and Leicester Royal Infirmary did not have a big enough scanner for him . The hospital has now apologised to Mr Perry's heartbroken mother, Angela Scrase . Mrs Scrase, also from Market Harborough, said: ‘The lack of progress with his treatment just left him hopeless and so he stopped getting better. ‘He was crying all the time and saying he wanted to be at home because he felt trapped in the hospital with no one looking after him and he couldn’t move. ‘He didn’t even have a buzzer to call for help and all he was told to do was shout if he needed anything. ‘He texted me one morning saying he had tried to call for help for two hours before anyone came. Mr Perry was admitted to hospital after developing numbness in his legs. Doctors suspected that he had inflammation of the spine and needed to carry out an MRI scan to confirm this . Mrs Scrase said that before her son developed the numbness in his legs he was healthy and did a lot of cycling and swimming despite his size . ‘He just wanted to know what exactly was wrong with him and know how to get better. ‘I admit he shouldn’t have been that weight but the care he received was terrible, he was as fit as a flea before he got ill. ‘Despite his size he was always outdoors, riding a bike and swimming. He was such a lovely lad and I adored him. ‘He did start to get the feeling back in his legs and he started physio but the progress wasn’t very good. ‘Before he died he couldn’t breathe and I said they should be transferring him to intensive care but they [the hospital] wouldn’t. ‘They had found a blood clot but it was too late. He died at midnight and I went crazy and wouldn’t let anyone touch him.’ Mr Perry (pictured with his girlfriend, Aulie) developed deep vein thrombosis and died in November 2012 because of a blood clot on his lung . Mr Perry's mother thinks he could have been saved if he had had a scan sooner. He is pictured at one . The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust has apologised to Mr Perry’s family and admitted they need to improve their care for obese patients. Rachel Overfield, Chief Nurse at Leicester’s Hospitals, said: 'We have met with and apologised to Mr Perry’s family, and would again like to offer our condolences for their loss. 'They raised a number of concerns with us and these were discussed with them through meetings and correspondence. 'At the time we recognised that we could have done some things differently to overcome a few specific challenges involved in caring for bariatric patients in hospital. 'Whilst Mr Perry was with us we provided him with a bariatric chair and a specially ordered bed with a pressure relieving mattress to reduce his risk of developing a pressure ulcer. 'Mr Perry was also receiving the appropriate medication to prevent a blood clot as well as physiotherapy. Mrs Scrase said: 'He was such a lovely lad and I adored him' The hospital has apologised to Mr Perry's family and says it has invested in better facilities for obese patients . 'Since then we have continued to improve processes and the specialist equipment we have available for this patient group. 'Unfortunately at the time there was a delay in accessing a suitable MRI for Mr Perry. 'Last year we replaced all of our MRI scanners and have purchased the widest ones available, which can take a patient up to 200kgs. 'It is worth pointing out that it is very rare that we are unable to scan a patient because of their weight, and on the rare occasions we do have difficulties it is because of the patients’ body shape and their inability to fit into the machine. 'In these instances we would refer the patient to the nearest hospital with the equipment to perform the MRI, which happens to be over 90 miles away in Cheltenham.'","Lee Perry, who weighed 34st, went to hospital with numbness in his legs .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . In recent years, astronomers have been astounded by just how much Saturn's moon Titan resembles Earth. Like our planet, the surface of Titan is covered with lakes and seas; it has islands, mud, rain clouds, river channels and, according to some scientists, even rainbows. And now the first hints of waves on the seas of the moon have now been revealed. If confirmed, this would be the first discovery of ocean waves beyond Earth. This image shows the first flash of sunlight reflected off a lake on Saturn's moon Titan. The glint off a mirror-like surface is known as a specular reflection. It confirmed the presence of liquid in the moon's northern hemisphere, where lakes are more numerous and larger than those in the southern hemisphere . In 2012 and 2013, Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft captured several unusual glints of sunlight off the surface of Punga Mare, one of Titan’s hydrocarbon seas. Those reflections may have been created by tiny ripples, around 2cm high, said Jason Barnes, a planetary scientist at the University of Idaho in Moscow. Professor Barnes presented the findings at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, according to a report in Nature. Researchers expect more waves to appear in the next few years, as winds pick up in Titan’s northern hemisphere as it emerges from winter and approaches spring. A glint of light is seen in the same spot in this image taken by the Cassini probe in July 2012 . With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is less massive than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (600km) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that come with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, . better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be . frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is 140°C (290°F) below zero. With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. Scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. Knowing how the waves form will help scientists to better understand the conditions in Titan’s lakes and seas. A Nasa mission proposal, which was beaten by a proposal to return to Mars, would have sent a probe to float in one of Titan’s lakes. ‘If we drop a lake lander in there, is it going to splat instead of splash?’ Professor Barnes asked at the conference. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -140°C (-290°F). The idea that Titan is a wet world with its own alien waters is widely accepted, but the lack of waves has stumped scientists for years. On Earth, bodies of water are rarely still. Breezes blowing across the surface cause waves to ripple and break; raindrops striking sea surfaces also provide some roughness. Yet on Titan, the lakes seemed eerily smooth, with no discernible wave action down to the millimetre scale, according to radar data from Cassini. Centered on the north pole, this map shows Titan's bodies of methane and ethane in blue and black. Roughly heart-shaped, the lake above and right of the pole is Ligeia Mare. Just below the north pole is Punga Mare. This is where Cassini spied several unusual glints of sunlight off the surface in 2012 and 2013 . Titan’s gravity, which is only 1/7th that of Earth, also provides very little resistance to wave motion. Researchers had previously toyed with several explanations, including that the lakes may be frozen or covered with a tar-like substance that damps wave motion. If waves appear over the next few years, Cassini should be able to detect them.  Radar reflections from wavy lake surfaces can tell researchers a great deal. Wave dimensions, for instance, may reveal the viscosity of the underlying fluid and, thus, its chemical composition. Also, wave speeds would track the speed of the overlying winds, providing an independent check of Titan climate models. Alex Hayes, a planetary scientist on the Cassini radar team, is excited about ‘bringing oceanography to another world. All we need now,’ he said, ‘are some rough seas.' Researchers expect more waves to appear in the next few years, as winds pick up in Titan's northern hemisphere as it emerges from winter and approaches spring.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Doctors using Skype to check on a patient at home helped save her husband’s life when he collapsed in front of them. Medics were monitoring kidney patient Brenda Griffin via the internet when they saw her husband, Peter, who was sitting next to her, keel over. The hospital staff immediately dialled 999 and told Mrs Griffin how she could unlink herself from her kidney dialysis machine so she could help her 70-year-old husband. Medics who were monitoring Brenda Griffin while she underwent dialysis via the internet saw her husband Peter collapse on camera and were able to guide Mrs Griffin on how to unlink herself and help her husband . Paramedics were alerted and he was was rushed to hospital where it was discovered he had bowel cancer. Mrs Griffin, 65, from Draycott, near Derby, said: 'I don’t know what would have happened if we hadn’t been using Skype that day. 'Skype had already given me my life back because it meant I could have my treatment at home. Now it’s saved my husband as well.' Royal Derby Hospital is one of the first in England to use Skype internet video technology to speak to patients at home. Mrs Griffin uses Skype on her tablet (pictured) to talk to experts, which allows her to have her kidney dialysis treatment at home. Royal Derby Hospital is one of the first in England to use Skype internet video technology so that patients do not have to spend so much time in hospital . Mrs Griffin had been attending three days a week to be hooked up to a dialysis machine for four hours at a time. But the treatment was gruelling and left her exhausted, so doctors came up with an alternative solution. Instead of traipsing into hospital, she would be able to stay at home to have her dialysis treatment, speaking face to face with staff at the hospital’s renal unit via Skype on her Kindle tablet. Mrs Griffin, a retired receptionist, said: 'My husband had set up the machine for me but it was one of those days where we were having problems with it, so I decided to Skype the unit. 'While I was talking, Peter suddenly said he didn’t feel well. He sat down and then, all of a sudden, he passed out. 'The hospital was asking what was going on as Peter came around. He went to go and mop his brow but then he passed out again. Mrs Griffin had been attending three days a week to be hooked up to a dialysis machine for four hours at a time . 'At this point, I was tied up to my machine so I couldn’t do anything. Peter normally helps me out with it. 'So the hospital sent out for the paramedics and then guided me on how to take myself off it. By the time I had managed to take the needles out, the paramedics had arrived. 'If it hadn’t been for Skype, I don’t know what would have happened. It’s a wonderful thing.' Mr Griffin, a retired British Rail supervisor, was taken to hospital after his collapse last November. Tests revealed he had collapsed and felt unwell because he was suffering from bowel cancer. Doctors operated on him the following month and he is now receiving lower doses of chemotherapy at home, through tablets. The hospital is hoping to extend Skype consultations to other departments.","Royal Derby Hospital is one of the first in England to use Skype internet video technology to speak to patients at home .

But a British amateur photographer has set his sights a lot higher and has taken incredible images of the sun’s raging surface from his back yard. The 72-year-old managed to capture violent solar flares and spots on the sun’s surface, which is 5,505°C and approximately 93million miles (150million km) away from Earth.

Despite being millions of miles away from the sun, he always urges caution when trying to capture it. ‘You have to be careful. Never look at the sun through anything other than equipment specialised for direct solar viewing or it will blind you,’ he warned. Solar flares (pictured) extend out to the layer of the sun called the corona, which is the outermost atmosphere of the star and is made up of highly rarefied gas . A flare is defined as a sudden, rapid and intense variation in brightness and occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released. Radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from long wavelength radio waves to x-rays and gamma rays. The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time, according to Nasa. The first solar flare was recorded in 1859 by two scientists - Richard C. Carrington and Richard Hodgson, who were independently looking at sunspots at the same time and saw a large flare. Solar flares extend out to the layer of the sun called the corona, which is the outermost atmosphere of the star and is made up of highly rarefied gas. This gas normally has a temperature of a few million degrees Kelvin, but inside a flare, the temperature typically reaches can reach as high as 100 million degrees Kelvin. The frequency of flares coincides with the sun's eleven year cycle and at its maximum – approximately every 11 years – solar flares are more common and larger.","Dave Tyler, from a village near High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire used a five inch refracting telescope with specialist filters to take the images .

"By . Mark Prigg . Amsterdam has begun making the first 3D printed house that can simply be slotted together on site from giant plastic 'bricks'. Dubbed the 'Lego House', the project is designed to look like one of the tall, narrow brick houses common in Amsterdam. The team plan to constantly improve the house as technology advances to show building firms what can be achieved. An artist's impression of the finished house. A visitor passes a 3D printer, rear, as she looks at part of the 'Lego house' in Amsterdam . At the core of the project is a 6-meter (20-foot) -tall printer dubbed the Kamermaker, or 'room-builder.' It's a scaled-up version of the open-source home 3-D printer made by Ultimaker, popular with hobbyists. It takes the Kamermaker about a week to print each massive, unique, honeycomb-structured block, layer by layer. The first block, which forms one corner of the house and part of a stairway, weighed around 180 kilograms (400 lbs). The blocks will later be filled with a foam material, still under development, that will harden like concrete to add additional weight and bind the blocks together. Dutch architects fabricated pieces of the canal house out of plastic with a giant 3-D printer and slotted them together like oversized Lego blocks. Hedwig Heinsman of architect bureau Dus says the goal of the demonstration project launched this month is not so much to print a functioning house - in fact, parts of the house will likely be built and re-built several times over the course of three years as 3-D printing technology develops. Rather, it is to discover and share the potential uses of 3-D printing in construction by creating new materials, trying out designs and testing building techniques to see what works. 'There's only one way to find out,' she says. 'By doing it.' She envisions a future in which personalized architecture may be custom-crafted on the spot, or perhaps selected from an online store for architectural designs, downloaded and tweaked.

"By . Mark Prigg . Scientists have used the remains of ancient chickens to prove that Columbus beat the Polynesians to discovering America. The study of ancient and modern chickens has dismissed a previous study of chicken bones which had claimed that Polynesian voyagers reaching South America before European explorers. The University of Adelaide's Australian Centre for Ancient DNA led an international team who looked again at bones from modern and ancient chickens - and believe it proves once and for all that Columbus did reach America first. The study ends the dispute which had claimed Polynesian voyagers reached South America before European explorers. The new study reveals that previous studies were probably based on contaminated results. The results showed that the chicken DNA had a distinct genetic marker that is not found in modern South American chickens, which suggests that the Polynesian and South American people did not have much contact. The research team used DNA extracted from modern chicken feathers and bones excavated from archaeological sites from islands including Hawaii, Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and Niue. Many of the modern samples used were collected as part of a sailing expedition from the Philippines to the islands of Anuta and Tikopia in West Polynesia made by two replica Polynesian catamarans back in 2009. Professor Keith Dobney, an Aberdeen University Scientist and co-author on the paper, joined the expedition sailing through the Solomon Islands and collecting hair and feather samples from domestic animals from remote island locations. Professor Dobney said 'These modern chicken samples proved crucial to the study, helping us to identify and track the unique genetic signatures of original Polynesian chickens across the Pacific and revealing their origins in the Philippines. 'Our research at Aberdeen, with colleagues from across the world, involves studying a range of domestic and invasive animals that were moved by people in the past. 'We're using a range of techniques (including DNA) to test theories about where early human colonists of the remote Pacific came from, which routes they followed and whether they ever voyaged as far as the South American mainland.' Illustration of Christopher Columbus and His Men Arriving on the Shores of America. It has been claimed Polynesian explorers had beat him there - until today. Project leader Professor Alan Cooper, Director of ACAD said: 'We were able to re-examine bones used in previous studies that had linked ancient Pacific and South American chickens, suggesting early human contact, and found that some of the results were contaminated with modern chicken DNA, which occurs at trace levels in many laboratory components. 'We were able to show that the ancient chicken DNA provided no evidence of any pre-Columbian contact between these areas. 'Remarkably, our study also shows that the original Polynesian lineages appear to have survived on some isolated Pacific islands, despite the introduction of European domestic animals across the Pacific in the last couple of hundred years,' Professor Cooper says. 'These original lineages could be of considerable importance to the poultry industry which is concerned about the lack of genetic diversity in commercial stocks.' Associate Professor Jeremy Austin, ACAD Deputy Director, said: 'There are still many theories about where the early human colonists of the remote Pacific came from, which routes they followed and whether they made contact with the South American mainland. 'Domestic animals, such as chickens, carried on these early voyages have left behind a genetic record that can solve some of these long standing mysteries.","New study reveals previous claims that Polynesians found the Americas are flawed .

"By . Mark Prigg . Legendary musician Neil Young has revealed plans for a high end digital music player and download service to take on Apple. Called Pono Music, it will use a $399 player, and will raise money via Kickstarter. It will offer 'lossless' downloads at a quality far higher than those offered by Apple or most other music services. The $399 Pono Player will play high quality audio files, and each player can hold between 100 and 500 songs . 'It's about the music, real music,' said said Neil Young, founder and chairman of PonoMusic. 'We want to move digital music into the 21st century and PonoMusic does exactly that. 'We couldn't be more excited about bringing PonoMusic to the market.' The gadget, announced at the SXSW festival in Austin, is described as a 'revolutionary movement'. Young has previously hit out at the quality of music downloads. Because files are compressed to make them smaller, information is removed - leading to a lower quality. 'The simplest way to describe what we’ve accomplished is that we’ve liberated the music of the artist from the digital file and restored it to its original artistic quality – as it was in the studio,' he said in a previous post on his Facebook page. 'Hearing Pono for the first time is like that first blast of daylight when you leave a movie theatre on a sun-filled day.' Neil Yioung said 'We want to move digital music into the 21st century and PonoMusic does exactly that' 'Our mission is to bring the highest-quality digital music to discerning, passionate consumers, who wish to experience music the way the artists intended, with emotion, detail and power intact,' the firm says. 'Our goal was to offer the highest quality digital music available from all the major labels with the world's greatest sounding, user-friendly portable music player. 'We've achieved our goal and we are excited to launch our Kickstarter campaign next week to invite music lovers everywhere to join the PonoMusic community and reserve a PonoPlayer for their own enjoyment,' said John Hamm, CEO of PonoMusic. The PonoPlayer has an LCD touch screen interface, and 128GB of memory allowing it to store 100 to 500 high-resolution digital-music albums.

The child is caught and quickly whisked away by helpers. Quick thinking neighbours then bring a ladder to the house to help the woman escape. She is seven months pregnant and seconds after climbing down, the building she was in collapses backwards on itself like a pack of cards. Then the ground opens up and everything starts to sink into it. The images are dramatic and shocking to watch. For the home owners, who had run to a safe distance, it was a devastating moment.

'A hole just opened up and sliced crossed the street engulfing all the houses around,” said a shocked Selma Costa, who lives in the area. 'Nobody can believe what happened. Houses were simply swallowed by the hole. Even the supermarket and an office went into the hole' she reported. 'Cracks just started opening up in the ground and huge craters appeared. Trucks, homes, everything went into the river,” said another resident. Many people tried fruitlessly to save their possessions. Devastating: For the home owners, who had run to a safe distance, it was a devastating moment . 'A hole just opened up and sliced crossed the street engulfing all the houses around,' said a shocked Selma Costa, who lives in the area . According to environmental experts who have been inspecting the area, the construction of houses close to the river and the uncontrolled growth of the neighbourhood are at the root of the problem . 'We worked so hard for everything and in the end we have lost everything,' lamented Alfredo Rodrigues, a farmer and one of the residents hit by the landslide. The area affected by the erosion borders the Maracatuíra river, which runs through the town. According to environmental experts who have been inspecting the area, the construction of houses close to the river and the uncontrolled growth of the neighbourhood are at the root of the problem, and are the main cause of the tragedy. Environmentalists warn that the removal of vegetation from the an area close to the banks of a river to make way for development affects the soils rate of absorption. Water that would have previously infiltrated tree and plant roots is no longer absorbed naturally and with nowhere to go soaks into and begins to erode the earth. In the days leading up to the disaster, river levels had risen to a dangerous high. The sink holes in Abaetetuba are believed to have been caused by a wearing away of soil and rock as the build up of water undermined the stability in the land. The authorities have already warned that if the river continues to swell, then residents can expect more damage and losses to the surrounding area. On Monday the local authority declared a state of emergency and the area affected has been declared a no-go zone. Families with nowhere to go have been put up in the local gymnasium. Others are living with  relatives unaffected by the devastation.","The terrifying incident was captured on CCTV in the city of Abaetetuba .

"By . Steve Doughty . In London nearly one in 50 people have Polish as their first language ¿ 1.9 per cent of the population . More than four million people in England and Wales – around one in 13 – do not use English as their  first language, official statistics show. More than 100 languages are spoken by significant numbers of people in the UK, according to census results. However, a big majority of the foreign language speakers have mastered English and can use it in their everyday lives. Only 138,000 people say they cannot speak English at all. The figures were taken from the findings of the 2011 National  Census and published by the Office for National Statistics. It said that 4.2 million people –  7.7 per cent of the population – speak a first language that is not English. Groups of foreign language speakers are found around the country. Around one in eight people in Leicester speak Gujarati as their first language. More than 6 per cent of those in Rushmoor, Hampshire – close  to the army bases of Aldershot and  an area with a strong Gurkha community – speak Nepalese. In the Lincolnshire town of Boston, more than 5 per cent of the population speak Lithuanian, Latvian, Russian or Polish. The greatest concentration of  foreign language speakers is in  London, where 22.1 per cent of  the population, around 1.7 million  people, have a language other  than English as their first language. The ONS said in its report:  ‘Language is an important defining characteristic of people’s identity. ‘It can be used with information from other identity questions such as ethnic group, nationality and religion to provide a detailed  picture of England and Wales.’ The highest concentration of people who speak Lithuanian as their first language are in Boston, Lincolnshire . Rachel Bull (left) challenged Mary Beard (right) who said immigrations fears in Boston were a 'myth'. Boston has the greatest concentration of Lithuanian speakers . The ONS added that the figures help ‘local authorities to provide public services, for example to  identify the need for translation and interpretation and English  language lessons’. In London nearly one in 50 people have Polish as their first language – 1.9 per cent of the population. The next most commonly used languages are Bengali, spoken by 1.5 per cent, and Gujarati, used by 1.3 per cent. The greatest concentration of  foreign language speakers in the capital are in the East London  borough of Newham, where 41.4 per cent of people have a non-English first language. In Westminster 5.7 per cent of the population have Arabic as a first language. In Kensington and Chelsea, just under 5 per cent of people are native French speakers. The greatest concentration of Lithuanian speakers is in Boston – the town which attracted attention in January after Cambridge academic Mary Beard told BBC1’s Question Time programme that its local fears over immigration were a ‘myth’ and that ‘public services can cope’. She was rebuked by local businesswoman Rachel Bull, a descendant of Polish grandparents, who said services were at ‘breaking point’.","In England and Wales 138,000 people cannot speak English at all .

Speaking out: Baroness Betty Boothroyd, pictured at Margaret Thatcher's funeral last year, worked with Flowers in the 70s and 80s, when he worked as a secretary for the Labour Party in her constituency of West Bromwich . She said: ‘He was very helpful. But he let the party down. He was happy to do a lot of work and was secretary of the party. ‘But he seemed to grow weary of it. I think West Bromwich was not big enough for him. ‘He was a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde character. Not in a nasty way. He had a wonderful enthusiasm but there was no real commitment there.’ Baroness Betty Boothroyd, born 1929, is the first and only female Speaker in the House of Commons. She served as a Labour MP for West Bromwich and West Bromwich West from 1973 until she became speaker in 1992. She served in the position until she resigned in October 2000.

Authorities are uncertain of how much marine fuel oil is leaking from the barge, though as of 10 p.m. Saturday local time, crews had yet to contain the spill, the Associated Press reported. The captain of the 585-foot ship Summer Wind called the collision into the Coast Guard at 12:30 p.m., shortly after the incident. The barge, which was being towed by the tugboat Miss Susan from Texas City to Bolivar, was carrying 924,000 gallons of fuel. Scroll down for video .

However, officials believe that only one of the barge's fuel tanks was punctured, though that tank contained 168,000 gallons of oil. They would also not say whether one vessel hit the other, or if weather played a factor in the crash. Marine traffic into and out of the ports of Galveston and Texas has been suspended, according to the Galveston Daily News, as crews continue to clean up the site. A boom was set up around the collision site to prevent oil from reaching environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, crews were working throughout the night to skim oil off the surface of the bay. Part of a barge that hit a ship in Galveston Bay is seen partially submerged . The scene in Galveston Bay Saturday after a ship collided with a barge carrying a large amount of oil . However, cleanup could take some time due to the type of oil that is leaking. The oil was described as 'sticky, gooey, thick, tarry stuff' by Jim Suydam, a spokesman for the General Land Office. 'That stuff is terrible to have to clean up.' The oil is also known as bottom of the barrel oil since it is so thick. Because it does not evaporate quickly, the cleanup would likely take days, said Coast Guard Capt. Brian Penoyer. The cleanup effort was helped on Saturday by favorable weather that included mild weather and calm water. However, that is set to change today as storms are set to enter the area. Environmental crews enter the Texas City Dike to assist in the cleanup of an oil spill in Galveston Bay . The barge itself remains partially submerged in one of the bay's channels.

Three-quarters of people across the continent felt corruption was widespread in their own country, according to research by the European Commission. Even in Britain, nearly six in ten said ‘bribery and connections’ were often the easiest way to get the best out of public services. Scroll down for video . Greece is considered to be the most corrupt nation in the EU, on a par with China . EU home affairs commissioner Cecilia . Malmstrom said the extent of the problem was ‘breathtaking’ and that . corruption was a ‘tumour on the body politic’. But the report axed questions on the Commission’s own record, despite claims £4billion a year is lost to fraud from its budget. The . Commission has been widely criticised for failing to take its own . corruption problems seriously. Its anti-corruption agency Olaf has a . budget of just £20million a year. But yesterday’s report from Brussels focused instead on the scale of corruption in individual member states. Ms Malmstrom said: ‘In a Europe that has barely come out of the economic crisis, we cannot afford to drag our feet any longer.’ Italy is also regarded as a particularly corrupt nation . The . new survey found that three-quarters of people across the EU felt that . corruption was widespread in their country. The figure for the UK was 64 . per cent.

The worst . affected country is Greece, where 99 per cent of people think corruption . is rife. The least corrupt is Denmark, where just 20 per cent of people . feel there is a major problem. The . new study also reveals also reveals that eight out of ten people . believe that close links between business and politics lead to . corruption. ‘Europe’s . problem is not so much with small bribes on the whole,’ said Carl Dolan . of Transparency International in Brussels. ‘It’s with the ties between . the political class and industry. ‘There . has been a failure to regulate politicians’ conflicts of interest in . dealing with business,’ he added. ‘The rewards for favouring companies, . in allocating contracts or making changes to legislation, are positions . in the private sector when they have left office rather than a bribe.’ The . report comes shortly after Romania’s former prime minister, Adrian .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Starbucks is ramping up efforts to compete with bars and restaurants by expanding its evening alcohol and light bites to ‘thousands of select stores’ over the next several years. The chain first offered beer and wine after 4 p.m. at one of its Seattle cafes in 2010. The Starbucks Evenings concept is now available in 26 cafes, with plans to reach 40 by the end of the year. The cafes also serve a variety of small dishes ranging in price from $3 to $5, such as bacon-wrapped dates, truffle macaroni and cheese, and flatbreads. The regular coffee menu is also available during that time. Scroll down for video . Starbucks is ramping up efforts to compete with bars and restaurants by expanding its evening alcohol and light bites to 'thousands of select stores' over the next several years . Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead told the Chicago Tribune that while the concept won’t work in all Starbucks cafes, they’d seen success in some urban areas, near other restaurants and theaters, where people are out at night. The expansion of Starbucks Evenings is part of the company's push to boost sales after the morning rush hour when people are getting their caffeine fix. There are about 11,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. It's a common concept in the restaurant industry - figuring out ways to maximize sales throughout the day since stores have to pay for rent and labor anyway. Taco Bell, for instance, recently started highlighting snacks in its ads to drive sales during the slower late afternoon hours. And the fruit shakes and other drinks at McDonald's are seen as a way to attract people throughout the day. The Starbucks Evenings concept is currently available in 26 cafes, with plans to reach 40 by the end of the year . As for Starbucks Corp., the chain recently introduced new sandwiches and salads to boost sales in the afternoon. It's also branching out into other areas to as it faces more competition in the coffee market. The company, which announced a long-term plan to almost double its market value to $100 billion yesterday, also is expanding and improving its rewards program and mobile applications. Earlier this month, Starbucks said it would soon test a way for customers to order items ahead of time with their smartphones. The company recently purchased a chain of tea shops called Teavana. CEO Howard Schultz has said he wants to make tea as popular in the U.S. as he's helped make coffee. As part of its effort to sell more tea, the company will begin offering Oprah Winfrey-branded chai tea on April 29 at stores in the U.S. and Canada. The 60-year-old billionaire appeared on stage at the coffee company's annual shareholder meeting in Seattle on Wednesday along with CEO Howard Schultz to announce the news. As well as beer and wine, the cafes also serve a variety of small dishes ranging in price from $3 to $5, such as bacon-wrapped dates, truffle macaroni and cheese, and flatbreads . They revealed the drink - called the . Oprah Chai - contains a 'bold infusion' of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, . cloves, black tea and rooibos and will be available in both latte and . loose-tea formats. There was no word on how much the drink will cost but currently Starbucks' signature Chai tea retails from $2.45. Proceeds from sales of the Oprah Chai will go towards Ms Winfrey's youth education charities. 'I looove tea,' the media mogul said in a press release. 'My daily tea ritual is a vital part of my morning. Savory and spicy chai, with its deep flavor, has long been a favorite of mine. 'When Howard Schultz offered to have me come into the Starbucks tasting room and create my very own tea blend, I thought that sounded like such a unique opportunity and fun to the tenth power. Cheers to that! Oprah Winfrey is to launch her own eponymous beverage at Starbucks next month . 'To share one of my favorite things . with the rest of the world and support youth education at the same time . is truly the perfect blend.' The Oprah Chai will be available in the U.S. and Canada from April 29. Ms Winfrey personally developed the . tea with leading teaologist, Naoko Tsunoda, from Teavana. It marks the first time she has lent her name to a brand. 'I think we got it right,' she said. Starbucks acquired the specialty-tea brand Teavana in 2012 in a move to expand beyond the coffee market and become a multi-product company. Perfect blend! The 60-year-old billionaire appeared on stage at the coffee company's annual shareholder meeting in Seattle this morning along with CEO Howard Schultz to announce the news . Tried and tested: They revealed the drink - called the Oprah Chai - contains a 'bold infusion' of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, cloves, black tea and rooibos and will be available in both latte and loose-tea formats . Touching on the collaboration with Ms . Winfrey he said: 'With the introduction of Teavana Oprah Chai, we are . going to elevate the tea experience in the same way we did for coffee. 'Partnering with Oprah Winfrey in the creation of this distinctive and remarkable tea is a strong next step forward in accomplishing this objective, while also giving back in a meaningful way through the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy Foundation. 'I am personally humbled to work with such an inspirational leader and visionary who shares so many of our core values and beliefs.' Mr Schultz also told shareholders the coffee company is still in the early stages of growth and has a long-term target of doubling its market cap to $100billion.","The coffee chain is rolling out its Starbucks Evenings concept to 40 stores by the end of the year .

"By . James Tozer . They were a hardworking couple from the wartime generation  that never dreamt of claiming anything from the state. But, despite paying taxes all their lives, when William Bullock's wife Barbara, 82, suffered a severe stroke that left her needing round-the-clock care, no help was forthcoming. In a sickening example of authorities' reluctance to pay care home bills – even when legally obliged to do so – health officials ruled that the former church organist's nursing fees had to come out of the couple's savings. Denied funding: Barbara Bullock suffered a severe stroke aged 82 . It was only once they had paid more than £80,000 for Mrs Bullock's care – including selling their house – that it emerged she was entitled to state support for the £1,500-a-month fees. After a five-year legal battle, her family have won back £80,000 made up of repaid fees and interest payments, but tragically Mr and Mrs Bullock both died before the claim was resolved. Lawyers specialising in reclaiming nursing fees warned that a huge backlog of cases means other elderly people will die before justice is done and the NHS could face a bill for hundreds of millions of pounds. Under English law, elderly people with assets worth more than £23,000 must pay for their residential care unless it is health-related. But the Daily Mail's Dignity For The Elderly campaign has highlighted the unfairness for those who are wrongly told they are ineligible despite suffering Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease or a stroke. Primary care trusts – which were responsible for funding 'continuing care' on the NHS until the role was given to clinical commissioning groups – interpreted national guidelines differently, resulting in a postcode lottery. (File picture) Elderly people with assets worth more than £23,000 must pay for their residential care unless it is health-related . Mrs Bullock met her husband during the Second World War when he was serving with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and she worked in a post office. After serving in Egypt and reaching the rank of lieutenant, Mr Bullock became an inspector of nuclear plants. The couple married in 1946 and settled in Cheshire. Mrs Bullock remained fit and active into her 80s, swimming and playing bowls. But she suffered a huge stroke in 2004. Paralysed on one side and unable to speak or feed herself, she moved into a nursing home. Social services told her daughter that as home-owners with reasonable savings the couple would have to fund the place themselves. Unaware that her health needs meant she was entitled to free care, they agreed to pay privately. Two years later the couple's £200,000 semi-detached home had to be sold as Mr Bullock was struggling to manage on his own and Mr Bullock moved in with his daughter Margaret Sturt. 'It was an incredibly stressful time,' Mrs Sturt said. 'I was trying to look after my dad while running a business during the day and trying to get to see my mother as often as I could … my health suffered and we were left with no savings at all.' In 2008 Mrs Sturt began a legal bid to reclaim the fees, but her mother died the next year aged 86 and her 90-year-old father died 15 months later. 'My father fought for his country, he and my mother paid all their taxes and never claimed anything from the State, and yet … they were totally let down,' Mrs Sturt said. There are an estimated 60,000 outstanding claims from middle-class families who say relatives were wrongly denied free care. Mrs Sturt's solicitor, Nick Turner, said: 'The system is in a state of disarray … The Government needs to step in – these cases have already caused much grief to families … and someone needs to have the decency to realise these delays just aren't good enough.'","Church organist Barbara Bullock suffered a severe stroke aged 81 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The technology was designed by Dlshad Othman, who is originally from Syria . A 27-year-old software engineer claims to have developed an app which tells people in Syria if they are about to be hit by a missile. The app allegedly tracks when a Scud missile is fired and by using a formula involving trajectory and speed, it can calculate where it is likely to land, he says. Warnings are then sent to people who have downloaded the app telling them to seek shelter. The technology was designed by Dlshad Othman, who is originally from Syria. Mr Othman attended a conference hosted by Google in New York this week where he spoke about the device. Emails are then sent to the website www.aymta.com which tracks the position of the missile and where it is likely to land. Mr Othman said he believes his website is the one of its kind in Syria. The word 'aymta' is Arabic for 'when'. The engineer said he remembered a friend posting Facebook in north Syria that a missile had passed over head which gave him the idea for the website. He says the website took him two months to design and it was officially launched in June. Information is gathered by seven spotters who are located in the hills outside Damascus. The spotters are all volunteers and according to Mr Othman it takes eight to 12 minutes for a missile to reach a northern target. Technology: The engineer designed the website www.aymta.com (pictured) which tracks missiles . The activist fled Syria in 2011 after fears he was going to be killed. He had been serving in the Syrian Army. He now lives in Washington D.C. and is hoping to adapt the app for other countries. This week residents in a town besieged by President Bashar al-Assad's forces appealed to the world to 'save us from death' in an open letter describing desperate conditions and suffering. Hundreds of men, women and children in Mouadamiya had died and thousands had been wounded, they said. Mouadamiya, on the southwest outskirts of the capital Damascus, was occupied by anti-Assad rebels last year and the government has been trying to win it back since then. 'Save us from death': The residents of Mouadamiya begged the world for help as the country remains in turmoil . 'For nearly one year, the city of Mouadamiya has been under siege with no access to food, electricity, medicine, communications, and fuel,' said the letter, distributed by the opposition Syrian National Council today. 'We have been hit by rockets, artillery shells, napalm, white phosphorous, and chemical weapons,' it said. The writers, who did not give their names, said they had managed to find enough power to run a computer and connect to the internet to send the letter. Conflict: President Bashar al-Assad speaking here during an interview . The SNC said nearly 12,000 people face starvation and death in Mouadamiya. About 90 percent of Mouadamiya has been destroyed, few doctors remained, and residents were eating 'leaves of trees. The government says the residents of Mouadamiya are being 'held hostage' by terrorists, the term it uses for armed opposition groups. It denies using chemical weapons. United Nations humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said last week that despite the government evacuating 3,000 people this month, thousands more remain trapped inside Mouadamiya. She said that United Nations teams had been denied access. Local doctors say hunger has become severe in recent months. More than 100,000 people have died during the war, which started with peaceful protests against four decades of Assad family rule in March 2011 then escalated into a civil war with sectarian overtones. Western powers have mostly backed opposition forces while Russia and Iran support Assad. Moscow and Washington are planning to hold peace talks in Geneva next month but the warring parties have not expressed a willingness to compromise.","The app tracks Scud missiles and can work out where it is likely to land .

Jagger, 70, landed in Los Angeles earlier this week after the Rolling Stones cancelled their planned Australian and New Zealand concerts following L'Wren Scott's death on Monday. Jagger's eldest daughter Karis, 43, lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two children, and her house is reportedly being used as the home base as she and her stepsisters have gathered there to comfort their father. Out of the house: Karis Jagger, the Rolling Stones frontman's eldest daughter, is seen leaving her house as it is reported that her father is staying there with her and her stepsisters as he grieves over the death of his longtime partner L'Wren Scott . Karis, 43, is a Yale-educated mother of two and grew close to her father after he admitted paternity following a lengthy back-and-forth with her mother Marsha Hunt . Hideout: Jagger is believed to be staying at Karis' Los Angeles home (pictured) and is accompanied by his daughters Georgia May, Elizabeth, Jade, and son James . Karis, who graduated from Yale in 1992, was raised early on by her mother, model Marsha Hunt who battled with Jagger until he admitted his paternity when Karis was 12-years-old. Partners: Jagger had been dating designer L'Wren Scott from 2001 until her death by suicide on Monday (pictured together in 2011) The pair have since built their relationship, particularly given his choice to take solace in her home. Jagger was in Perth on Monday night when news of his longtime partner's suicide in New York. His daughters Georgia May and Elizabeth- sisters whose mother is Mick's second wife Jerry Hall- flew to be with him immediately and accompanied him to California. The Rolling Stones plane refueled in . Los Angeles before carrying on to England, but when it touched down in . the U.K., Keith Richards was the only main band member on board. Jagger's . spokesman has since confirmed that the rocker has stayed in California . and now has most of his children- Karis, Jade, Elizabeth, Georgia May, . and James- by his side. (The only ones absent are his youngest sons . Gabriel and Lucas, who are 16 and 14 respectively.) The . latest twist in the saga surrounding Scott's sudden suicide comes as . her brother has reportedly agreed to allow Jagger to plan a West Coast . funeral for her. The couple began dating in 2001 after meeting when she was a stylist on a photo shoot featuring the rock superstar. At . the time, Scott had been living in Los Angeles and she maintained a . home there in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood until 2009 when she sold . the three-bedroom home for $860,000. Family: L'Wren (center left) had become close with Jagger's daughters from previous relationships, including Jade (left) and Georgia May (center right) whose mothers are his first and second wives respectively . Glamor couple: Scott was a well-known designer in her own right but had become a more famous name since she took her relationship with Jagger public (seen together at the Met Costume ball in 2012 at left and in 2011 at right) Her old stomping grounds: Scott sold her 3-bedroom home in Hollywood Hills (pictured) in 2009 . 'I can’t help thinking, now, that a huge part of L’Wren’s spirit, what gave her grit and endurance, remained in the West. And without it, maybe she was maybe was a little lost, a little less sure of herself,' Scott's good friend Cathy Horyn, The New York Times fashion critic, wrote in a moving tribute to the designer. Giving the OK: L'Wren's brother Randall Bambrough is reportedly allowing Jagger to hold the funeral for L'Wren in Los Angeles . She went on to recall how Scott would host dinners at the house, including a memorable outdoor Thanksgiving dinner with a number of Jagger's bandmates and their significant others in the home's walled garden. Scott's body was found in her Manhattan apartment on Monday morning by an assistant who had reportedly been told to come over by Scott via text just moments before she killed herself. Some close friends of the designer- including actress Ellen Barkin- went to the apartment and reportedly spent time with the body before the medical examiner removed it from the apartment. Though spokesmen had confirmed the suicide hours after the body was found, the medical examiner ruled it as such on Wednesday. Her body was claimed on Thursday but the medical examiner could not release the name of the individual who arranged the transfer to the Frank E. Campbell funeral home on the Upper East Side. The funeral home, which regularly handles high-profile deaths like that of Jackie Kennedy and more recently Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is now reportedly coordinating a transfer of her body from New York to California after The New York Post revealed that her brother Randall Bambrough agreed to Jagger's wishes. Heartbroken: Jagger, 70, is said to be torn apart over the 'tragic' death of his longtime partner, 49 (pictured together in December 2012)","The Rolling Stone frontman is staying with his children in Los Angeles in the wake of his partner L'Wren Scott's suicide .

"By . Mark Duell . A five-year-old boy was tonight ‘fighting for his life’ after an accident on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland Paris. The child from Montpellier is in a critical condition at Necker Hospital in Paris after ‘falling under a machine’ at the end of the ride at 4.50pm local time (3.50pm GMT) today, local media said. Emergency services were called when the unidentified boy became ‘trapped between a platform and a boat’. The child had lost his balance and fallen overboard, reported the Europe 1 radio network. Incident: The boy had an accident on the Pirates Of The Caribbean ride (file picture) at Disneyland Paris . Interior: The flume-based ride (file picture) was opened in 1992 at the Paris park and lasts for 10 minutes . He then became stuck under the boat behind the one carrying him, before his father jumped into the water and managed to free him. A Disneyland spokesman has confirmed the accident happened. He told AFP: ‘The incident took place in late afternoon. Our first aid services quickly intervened to provide him first aid. The attraction is temporarily closed and we stand with the family.’ A spokesman for Disneyland has not yet returned a request for comment by MailOnline. The flume-based ride, which inspired . the hit films, was opened in 1992 at the Paris park and lasts for around 10 . minutes. The original ride was built in 1967 at Disneyland in Anaheim, .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The Ministry of Justice has suspended a prison meat supplier after it was discovered that Halal pies and pasties may have contained traces of pork DNA. The meat had been sourced from a properly Halal certificated caterer, however an investigation showed that the products could have contained traces of non-Halal meat, including pork. The consumption of pork is forbidden under Islamic law, and all of the contaminated products have been withdrawn with immediate effect, the Ministry said. Chopped: Meat supplied to prisons by a Halal caterer (not pictured) may have contained traces of pork DNA. The meat is not supplied by butchers such as this man as it is forbidden under Islamic law . The scandal comes in the wake of traces of horse DNA being found in burgers on sale to the public. As a result major food retailers and suppliers have been summoned to an urgent meeting following the spate of mis-labelled or contaminated food products reaching families. Yesterday the Food Standards Agency (FSA) ordered food companies to a conference on Monday following a number of recent cases that . have shaken consumer confidence in food labelling. 'People have a right to expect that the food they are eating is correctly described,' said a spokesman. 'It is the responsibility of food businesses to ensure the food they . sell contains what it says on the label. Slammed: Justice minister Jeremy Wright has labelled the scandal over Halal prison food as 'unacceptable', and said that the Prison Service would investigate . 'We are considering, with . relevant local authorities, whether legal action is appropriate . following the investigation.' The meeting has been organised to establish what has been happening, and what the next steps should be. The Prison Service has also launched an investigation after a number of Halal meat pies . and pasties supplied to jails were found to contain traces of pork DNA. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said that following the discovery of non-Halal meat and the traces of pork, all prisons had been informed, as well as the FSA, before steps were taken to suspend the relevant supplier, which has not been named. 'All prisons have been informed about this very regrettable . incident and we reported this issue to the Food Standards Agency . immediately,"" he said. 'We are taking immediate steps to suspend the contract with the relevant subcontractor.' The FSA added that the local authority where the supplier is based was investigating how the contamination came about and whether products have been distributed elsewhere in the UK. Justice minister Jeremy Wright slammed the prison food scandal and offered his support to those affected by the blunder. 'This is an absolutely unacceptable situation, and one which we regret greatly,' he said. 'Clearly this must be distressing for those affected and they can be reassured we are doing everything we can to resolve the situation. 'The Prison Service is investigating this as a matter of urgency.' The Prison Reform Trust said that it welcomed the immediate apology and investigation. Director Juliet Lyon said: 'This is not a matter of dietary preference but of Islamic law. 'There are clear hospital and prison rules that Halal meat must be on the menu. Admitted: Burger King says it had  been selling burgers containing horse DNA and had dropped the Irish supplier Silvercrest, which also supplied Tesco, Asda and The Co-Op . 'This . lapse will have offended and distressed high numbers of Muslim . prisoners and their families so apologising, suspending the supplier and . investigating the incident are the right steps for the Ministry of . Justice to take.' The revelation follows the recent scandal over horsemeat contamination. On . Thursday Burger King admitted that it had been selling burgers . containing horsemeat and  dropped the Irish food processing plant which . had supplied the products contaminated with horse DNA. The contaminated burgers were made by the Irish-based processing company, Silvercrest, which is part of the ABP Foods Group. The same company also made tainted burgers for Tesco, Asda and the Co-op, among others. Dropped: Tesco, Aldi and the 'Co-op' have dropped Irish supplier Silvercrest Foods after horse was DNA found in frozen burgers produced at the plant . Aldi . said that a sample of its frozen Oakhurst Beefburgers showed up . positive for 0.1per cent horse DNA, while its Oakhurst Beef Quarter . Pounders were 0.1per cent equine and 0.1per cent pork. The company withdrew all of its frozen burgers from UK stores when the scandal first erupted two weeks ago as a precaution. Also on Thursday, Aldi admitted for the . first time that burgers sold through its UK stores were probably . contaminated with traces of horse meat. Its burgers were made by a British supplier, Dalepack, which is based in Richmond, north Yorkshire. The . same company manufactured burgers for Iceland, which has also admitted . to finding horse meat in products sold to families in this country. Dalepack also makes burgers for Waitrose and Sainsbury's, which both insist that their burgers are clear of contamination.","Prison meat supplier suspended immediately after traces of pork DNA found .

The pictures from Surrey come as communities in the South were warned they were still at risk of flooding from swollen rivers and saturated ground. On Sunday, which was the peak of flooding along the Thames, around 400 tonnes of water per second flowed along the river at Windsor. And levels along many parts of the Thames - including Purley, Henley, Marlow and Maidenhead - reached a decade-long high. There are currently 18 Environment Agency flood warnings and 98 flood alerts in place for England and Wales, with the majority in the South.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Lewis Dale, 17, is facing a lengthy jail term after stabbing his grandmother to death while high mephedrone . A teenager, jailed today for stabbing his grandmother to death while high on the former legal high mephedrone, was hallucinating that a Swat team was after him and he needed to 'go to war'. Lewis Dale, 17, stabbed his grandfather Allan Dale, 80, twice with a kitchen knife before butchering stabbing his grandmother Irene Dale, four times as she lay in her bed screaming: 'What are you doing, Lewis?' Dale wept in the dock of Hull Crown Court as he was told he would face receive a lengthy jail term after a jury found him guilty of charges of murder and attempted murder. Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, told him: 'You have been found guilty of murder and attempted murder for which you will be sentenced after I have had a full report from a doctor. 'The sentence for murder is fixed by law, because you are 17, it will be that you are detained at Her Majesty’s pleasure. 'It is the equivalent of a life sentence, but I have the responsibility of passing a minimum term. You also have to sentenced for attempted murder. 'The sentencing exercise is not straight forward. I can tell you the sentence I will impose will be a long one.” As Dale was led below to a cell, his father David shouted: 'Love you son!' His grandfather Allan Dale appeared close to tears in the public gallery . Mother-of-three Irene Dale, who had been married 57 years, had taken in the grandson she had nursed from a toddler in a play pen because he needed a bail address as he was in trouble with police. She had no idea he had bought £50 worth of methedrone that afternoon and was sat hallucinating that police Swat teams were coming for him and that he needed to pull on his helmet and 'go to war'. He stormed into the pensioners' bedroom stabbing them as they lay in bed before stealing their television and jar of 50ps to exchange for six more grams of mephedrone within two hours of her death. Stabbed: Irene Dale, left, died of her wounds in the bed where she was attacked. Allan Dale, right, was also attacked several times as his grandson made his escape, jurors heard . Allan Dale told Hull Crown Court: 'It . was just like Norman Bates in Psycho. He had his bathrobe hood up and . had picked the strongest knife in the block. 'He . lunged at me and plunged the knife in my chest. I got up. I heard Irene . say: ""What are you doing Lewis?"" She was scared. He went around to my . wife and stabbed her as she tried to protect herself with the duvet . 'He thew the knife at me and it ended up sticking in the floor. Mr . Dale tried to barricade himself in the bedroom shifting a cabinet . across the door as he feared Lewis Dale thought they both weren’t dead . and would return to kill them. He . tried to put his wife in the recovery position but could not dial 999 . as Lewis, who was expelled from school and stole from his father to pay . for drugs, had cut the telephone cable. Lewis . Dale shouted from down stairs: 'Give me some money! Give me some money, . then I’ll go!' before getting into a taxi with a case full of designer . clothes and waving to his granddad 'as if he was going on holiday'. He . left the pair bleeding to death showing no remorse immediately trying . to cover his tracks. He then took a taxi to his dealer’s address in Hull, where he sold their TV in exchange for more drugs. Accused: Dale, left and right, denies murder and attempted murder. Jurors heard they will have to decide whether he was capable of intending to kill at the time of the attack . When armed police arrested him he only . had two grams of mephedrone left and had dumped his mobile telephone . and changed his clothes. He . never asked how his granddad was and was only worried about long he . would serve in prison and where his valuable designer clothes where. He told police the mephedrone he found 'was the best stuff in Hull' and asked:  'Am I in here for the longest?' Dale . was a heavy and habitual user of the drug, also known as Meow Meow and . M-Cat, a former legal high which was only made illegal in the UK in . 2010. He was expelled from . South Holderness Technology College at the age of 15 for damage and . threatening staff, soon after he began using the drug. His . grandfather told police: 'I can only describe Lewis as psychotic at the . time, due to the way he lunged at me and went around the bed to stab . Irene. I could not make sense of what was happening.' Dale had been sent to live with his grandparents after assaulting a teenage boy outside his father’s home in Brough. He . had also been arrested two days before that incident after taking his . father’s car without permission and running it off the road. Scene: The house in Hull where Irene Dale was stabbed to death . Dale denied murder and manslaughter, claimed to have been suffering from a psychotic episode. He . sobbed in front of the jury saying he could not remember the attack and . 'does not deserved to be on this planet' for stabbing his grandparents . while they lay in bed. He . said: 'My grandma was great, unbelievable. I loved her. We always used . to go together and walk the dog. I always got on with my grandma and . granddad.' Dale claimed he . had been using the drug for 18 months and admitted stealing cash, a . mobile phone and credit cards from his father to pay for it. He . said immediately before the attack he remembers sitting on a sofa . sharpening a knife thinking a Swat team was after him and he was scared. He said he was having hallucination and he thought they were coming for him in his grandparent’s living room. His . defence team suggest he had armed himself because he thought he was . 'going to war' against the Swat team and pulled his hood up like putting . on a helmet. Dale’s . barrister Andrew Robertson, QC, said: 'It is difficult to fathom how he . could do it to the grandparents he loved so much. It becomes impossible . to understand unless it is put in the context of this defedant being . completely out of his mind. It will live with him for the rest of his . days.' Crown barrister . Adrian Strong had told the jury: 'He is seeking to blame M-Cat for his . actions. It could be the shame and grief at what he has done means he is . not being honest with you. 'His . actions were clearly influenced by his drug taking but were decisions . nonetheless, that he made and there are consequences.' Prof . Robert Pethic, a consultant psychiatrist, told the jury he did not . believe Lewis Dale was suffering from a drug-induced psychosis. He said: 'The very reason M-Cat . is illegal, and not a proper drug, is because it has a whole range of . unpleasant affects, making your heart race, altering your perceptions . and making you feel charged. 'Unfortunately . for quite a lot of young people, it is a feeling they desire. It can be . dangerous, which is what we have seen here. It’s right M-Cat is not . lawful.' Dale was found . guilty on on 10-2 majorities after a seven-day trial at Hull Crown . Court. The jury spent 7 hours 12 minutes deliberating.  will be . sentenced at Hull Crown Court in four weeks time.","Lewis Dale, 17, weeps in the dock as he is told he faces lengthy jail term .

"By . Mark Duell . A market town in Nottinghamshire was today named as the best place in England and Wales to bring up a family. Bingham, which has a population of 9,000, has topped a study which examined factors including quality of schools, childcare provision, affordability of living and crime levels. Areas in the Midlands and the North of England are now more prominent thanks to more affordable housing in relation to the South, according to Family Investments which commissioned the survey. Top town for families: Bingham, which lies nine miles east of Nottingham, has a population of 9,000 people . Preferred location: St Mary and All Saints Church in Bingham, a town which is home to a large variety of clubs and social groups including a model railway club, folk club and archery club . The areas making up the remainder of the top ten are Crowthorne, Berkshire; Winscombe, Somerset; Colyton, Devon; Oakham, Rutland; Wokingham, Berkshire; Poynton, Cheshire; Swanland, Yorkshire; Faringdon, Oxfordshire and Dunnington, Yorkshire. These are followed by Longridge, Lancashire; Church Crookham, Hampshire; Yarm, Yorkshire; Woodley, Berkshire; Shebbear, Devon; Leyland, Lancashire; Sedbergh, Cumbria; Kirkham, Lancashire; Kesgrave, Suffolk and Buckingham in Buckinghamshire. The study noted that 77 per cent of GCSE pupils in Bingham achieved A* to C grades compared with the national average of 43 per cent, while the area had a large variety of clubs and social groups and affordable house prices. Kate Moore, head of savings and investments at Family Investments, said: ‘Bingham's combination of affordable housing, low crime and excellent local schools make it a winning location for bringing up a family. First place: Bingham's affordable house prices make it an attractive destination with an average two bed property costing £138,969 versus the national average of £173,632 . Amenities: In addition to a farmers' market, the centre of the Nottinghamshire town has a range of retail outlets, including a post office, pharmacy and six local pubs . ‘It's set in a relatively rural location but is a large enough town to have good amenities and the locals tell us there's a strong community spirit. Bingham, which lies nine miles east of Nottingham, has a . population of 9,000 people. Close to Newark-on-Trent and Grantham, it scored highly . in Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4 results - with four schools, including . three primaries and a secondary comprehensive. The town is home to a large variety of clubs and social . groups including a model railway club, folk club and archery club. In addition to a farmers’ market, the centre has a range of . retail outlets, including a post office, pharmacy and six local pubs. Equipped with sports amenities and a swimming pool, Bingham . Leisure Centre is popular with residents, as is the local Scout Group which . attracts 140 youngsters. Bingham’s affordable house prices make it an attractive . destination with an average two-bedroom property costing £138,969 versus the . national average of £173,632. A train to London can take as little as two hours with a change, while driving the 127-mile route takes around two-and-a-half hours. ‘Every parent will have a different idea about what makes the ideal location to bring up their family but we have tried to be as comprehensive as possible in measuring a huge range of factors to come up with a list which reflects the attributes parents tell us are most important. ‘One of the most noticeable trends in this year's report was the increased number of locations in the Midlands and northern England compared to last year. ‘This largely reflects the shift in house price trends over the past year resulting in increased affordability of property outside of the South of England. Lancashire for example scored well in this year's report with three of the top 20 postcodes located in the county.’ The factors considered by the study included key stage two and four results, school inspection outcomes, quantity and quality of early years care, affordability of childcare, local crime figures and property affordability. It also considered the availability of an existing population of parents with young children, parks and green spaces, leisure centres, zoos and farms and museums and theatres. No London location made it into the national top 20, mainly due to the high cost of property there - but the study also looked at the best spots in the capital for family friendly living. Coming out on top was Bexley in south-east London, followed by Epsom and Banstead in south-west London. Sutton in south London and Rickmansworth in north-west London also scored well. A spokesman for the company said it had not produced a list of Britain's worst towns for familes. In context: Bingham is located east of Nottingham, south-west of Newark-on-Trent and south-east of Mansfield .","77% of GCSE pupils in Nottinghamshire town achieved A* to C grades .

"By . James Rush . Millions of pounds were claimed by benefits cheats living abroad last year for family members who had died, it has been revealed. Benefit fraud committed abroad cost the taxpayer an estimated £84million in 2012/13 - a rise of 90 per cent in the last two years, new figures suggest. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 'abroad fraud' is now the third largest type of fraud with investigators looking into 7, 296 cases of suspected abroad fraud in 2013.‬ . Benefits cheats living abroad have fraudulently claimed an estimated £84m, the Department for Work and Pensions has said (file picture) Pension Credit made up the majority of the fraudulently claimed money at £52m, while £19m was claimed for housing benefit and a further £12m claimed for income support. Investigators have suggested a number of those investigated had been receiving the benefits from Britain for family members who had died. Minister for Welfare Reform Lord Freud has said while the majority of benefits claimants play by the rules, 'there is a minority who really try to take the biscuit' The Government is planning to increase the use of life certificates this year to stop fraudsters continuing to claim benefits where the claimant has died. It is also planning to increase data sharing so foreign countries tell the British government about overseas claimants.‬ . ‪Minister for Welfare Reform Lord Freud said:‬ 'Benefits are there to help those who need it and the vast majority play by the rules and would not once dream of cheating. But there is a minority who really try to take the biscuit.‬ . 'We have safeguards in place to bring these types of cases to our attention and we will make sure benefits are stopped when there is evidence of a fraud being committed.'‬ . The majority of suspected benefits cheats investigated were living in Spain, with 769 cases looked into. Pakistan was the next highest with 628 while Turkey was the third highest with 298 cases. ‪Richard West, head of the DWP's counter-fraud teams said:‬ 'Cases range from people hiding foreign assets and homes to those moving aboard, either temporarily or permanently, at the taxpayers’ expense.‬ . 'Benefit cheats need to know that even if they are out of the country our teams will still investigate, and where necessary bring them back to the UK to face justice.‬' Other fraudulent claims include where claimants leave Great Britain after their claim starts and not notifying the DWP before leaving the country.","Estimated £84m of benefit fraud committed abroad, new figures suggest .

"By . Rob Waugh . In the 70s, James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis claimed that Earth's physical and biological processes 'link' to form a self-regulating, basically 'self-aware' system . In the 70s, James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis claimed that Earth's physical and biological processes 'link' to form a self-regulating, basically 'self-aware' system. Their book became a cult classic, and the idea that the Earth is a giant chemical system, almost like an 'organism' persists to this day - although it's never been proved. In 2010, a poll of 400 academics placed the Gaia Hypothesis the sixth greatest British academic breakthrough of all time. Now a new chemical clue - sulphur - could allow scientists to work out whether Earth is in fact 'alive' - a huge chemical system that in turn sustains us all. The Gaia hypothesis doesn't claim that the earth is actually 'alive' - but that all living organisms and their non-living surroundings are bound together into a 'system' that maintains the conditions for life. One of the early predictions of Lovelock's theory - known as the Gaia -  hypothesis was that there should be a sulphur compound made by organisms in the oceans that would transfer to the air and thus to the land. Scientists are on the brink of testing this theory - and proving the existence of at least one part of a 'system' of the Earth. The most likely candidate for this role was deemed to be dimethyl sulphide. Harry Oduro of the University of Maryland has created a tool for tracing and measuring the movement of sulphur through ocean organisms, the atmosphere and the land in ways that may help prove or disprove the controversial Gaia theory. Sulphur, the tenth most abundant element in the universe, is part of many inorganic and organic compounds. Sulphur cycles sulphur through the land, atmosphere and living things and plays critical roles in both climate and in the health of organisms and ecosystems. ‘Dimethylsulfide emissions play a role in climate regulation through transformation to aerosols that are thought to influence the earth's radiation balance,’ says Oduro, who conducted the research while completing a Ph.D. in geology & earth system sciences at Maryland and now is a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Their book became a cult classic, and the idea that the Earth is a giant 'organism' persists to this day - although it's never been proved . The Gaia hypothesis - first proposed in the 70s - doesn't claim that the earth is actually 'alive' - but that all living organisms and their non-living surroundings are bound together into a 'system' that maintains the conditions for life. It was initially scorned by scientists, but is now being seriously investigated by Earth scientists and scientists in other disciplines - observing how the evolution of life have contributed to the stability of temperature and ocean salinity. It's also inspired various political and religious movements - with many interpreting the hypothesis as a claim that the Earth actually IS alive. 'We show that differences in composition of dimethylsulfide may vary in ways that will help us to refine estimates of its emission into the atmosphere and of its cycling in the oceans.’ As with many other chemical elements, sulphur consists of different isotopes. All isotopes of an element are characterised by having the same number of electrons and protons but different numbers of neutrons. Therefore, isotopes of an element are characterized by identical chemical properties, but different mass and nuclear properties. As a result, it can be possible for scientists to use unique combinations of an element's radioactive isotopes as isotopic signatures through which compounds with that element can be traced. ‘Harry's work establishes that we should expect to see variability in the sulfur isotope signatures of these compounds in the oceans under different environmental conditions and for different organisms,' says UMD geochemist James Farquhar. 'I think this will ultimately be very important for using isotopes to trace the cycling of these compounds in the surface oceans as well as the flux of dimethylsulfide to the atmosphere. It  may even help us to better trace connections between dimethylsulfide emissions and sulfate aerosols, ultimately testing a coupling in the Gaia hypothesis,’ Farquhar says .","'Gaia Hypothesis' claims earth is self-regulating 'organic' system that maintains life .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Egg whites could lower blood pressure in the same way as medication, new research has found. A key component found in the whites was found to have the same blood pressure lowering properties as Captopril, a high blood-pressure drug. Dr Zhipeng Yu, who led the research at China's Jilin University, said: 'Our research suggests that there may be another reason to call it 'the incredible, edible egg'. A component found eggs whites has been found to have the same blood pressure lowering properties as some medication . 'We have evidence from the laboratory that a substance in egg white - it's a peptide, one of the building blocks of proteins - reduces blood pressure about as much as a low dose of Captopril, a high-blood-pressure drug.' Dr Yu and his colleagues studied a peptide found in egg white called RVPSL. This has a powerful ability to inhibit or block the action of ACE, a substance produced in the body that raises blood pressure. Experiments with rats showed RVPSL had no toxic effects and lowered the blood pressure. The findings were presented to the National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in New Orleans. Dr Yu said: 'Our results support and enhance previous findings on this topic. 'They were promising enough to move ahead with further research on the effects of the egg white peptide on human health.' Dr Yu said he believed that egg white peptides, either in eggs or as a supplement, could become useful as an adjunct to high-blood-pressure medication. The substance in egg white has a powerful ability to inhibit or block the action of ACE, a substance produced in the body that raises blood pressure . In 2009, scientists at the University . of Alberta in Canada found that eggs produce proteins that mimic the . action of powerful blood pressure-lowering drugs. They too found that eggs may lower blood pressure in the same way as Ace inhibitors. The drugs lower blood pressure by stopping the hormone angiotensin narrowing the body's blood vessels. The researchers found that when eggs come in contact with stomach enzymes, they produce a protein that acts in the same way. Last month researchers at the University of Missouri reported that a high protein breakfast of eggs is the best way to control appetite and stop dieters snacking at night. Experts at  have found that a breakfast rich in protein significantly improves appetite control and reduces unhealthy snacking on high-fat or high-sugar foods in the evening.","Component in egg whites can lower blood pressure as much as Captopril, a .

Aston Martin is recalling most of its sports cars built since late 2007 after discovering a Chinese sub-supplier was using counterfeit plastic material in a part supplied to the luxury sports carmaker . The Vanquish is not affected. Aston Martin found that Shenzhen Kexiang Mould Tool Co Limited, a Chinese subcontractor that molds the affected accelerator pedal arms, was using counterfeit plastic material supplied by Synthetic Plastic Raw Material Co Ltd of Dongguan, according to documents filed with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The cars are being recalled from model years 2008 through 2014 because the accelerator pedal arm may break, increasing the risk of a crash, according to the NHTSA documents.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Found dead: Charlie Denihan, 28, was found in his apartment on Sunday night . New reports claim that a hotel heir who was found dead in an apparent drug overdose was not alone when he died on Sunday. Police were called to Charlie Denihan's apartment on the evening of March 16th and initial reports claimed that his roommate found him dead. Now The New York Post says that a friend has disputed that version of events, saying that the 28-year-old son of the Denihan Hospitality Group founder does not have a roommate at all and a female model was the one who first found him dead. The model, 23-year-old Sarah Walker, did not admit to being involved in the situation but did confirm that she knew 'Charlie'. The unidentified friend said that he was the one who connected Denihan and Walker in the days leading up to his death. 'I introduced him to Sarah last week and she stuck around and we couldn’t get rid of her,' the photographer friend claimed The Post. 'He said, ""I like taming lions."" She was with him all weekend. The last thing she said to me on Monday was that she woke up in his apartment and he was dead.' Because the medical examiner's report has not been released yet, his official time of death is still unknown, which will help clarify the timeline of events. When contacted by The Post, Walker, who works as both a model and actress, said that she would not be commenting 'out of respect for Charlie and his family'. Was she there? An unnamed friend said that he introduced Denihan to 23-year-old model Sarah Walker and claimed that she told him she woke up in bed with him in his Union Square West apartment (right) to find him dead . Tragic: Police were called to Denihan's apartment at around 7.45pm . Denihan, a Cornell School of Hotel . Administration graduate, was born and raised in Manhattan and had a . history of working for start-ups in the city. Accident: NYPD sources said that there is no criminal investigation open in connection to Denihan's death suggesting that foul play was not considered a factor . The . Denihan Hospitality Group runs three luxury Manhattan hotels- The . James, The Mansfield and The Surrey along with others across the . country. 'I spent quite a . few nights with Charlie and there is no way he was using GHB or meth,' a . different friend said, according to The Post. 'He was a fun-loving guy who worked hard and partied hard. He was in great shape. This never should have happened.' Calls to the medical examiner were not . immediately returned but initial reports alleged that his death was . believed to be the result of an accidental overdose. Suspicions . were raised because two other drug-related deaths were reported in a . four-hour span that evening and the drug GHB was allegedly found at each . scene. The other two men . who were found dead have been identified as 34-year-old Shaun Murphy and . 37-year-old Jovin Raithz and it is not known if the three men knew each . other. Though police were . said to be investigating any questions, an NYPD spokesperson told . MailOnline on Thursday that there were no criminal investigations open . in relation to his death, which there would be if there were any . connection between the three deaths. Social: A friend (not pictured) said that the GHB found at Denihan's apartment was not Charlie's and while the Cornell grad partied hard he did work hard as well . Denihan's family released a statement after his death asking for privacy and an obituary was published in The New York Times on Wednesday. 'Although the youngest of four siblings, Charlie had an extraordinary bond with his slightly older, special needs brother Tully, and was a 'big' brother to him from the moment he was born,' the obituary read. 'Those who met Charlie consistently walked away moved by his presence, knowing well that he was a friend who would always be there when it really counted.' A wake will be held for him at the Frank Campbell Funeral Home on the Upper East Side- which is where Jackie Kennedy, Heath Ledger and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's services were arranged- on Friday and that will be followed by his funeral on Saturday at St Ignatius of Loyola.","A friend has revealed that hotel heir Charlie Denihan was not alone in his Manhattan apartment the night before he was found dead .

"By . Gemma Hartley . IF it’s not hedge funds, it’s hedges. Shamed former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin has suffered a shredding at the hands of the opposition in a lengthy row over shrubbery. Long-suffering neighbours of the disgraced financier have lost patience and taken a chainsaw to part of the massive hedge at the centre of a row in an exclusive Edinburgh suburb. Before and after: The double-layer 25ft Leylandii hedge stood tall, left, before it was chopped down to the same height as other fences in the area, right, by neighbours who wanted to let more light into their gardens . Mr Goodwin has been feuding with Colinton neighbours for more than four years over the double-layer, 25ft Leylandii hedge at his property in an area where houses can cost £3.5million . Mr Goodwin has been feuding with Colinton neighbours for more than four years over the double-layer, 25ft Leylandii hedge at his property in an area where houses can cost £3.5million. A new law is due to come into force in April empowering councils to make and enforce decisions in relation to hedge disputes. But some neighbours decided not to wait and chopped down the nearest layer of Leylandii in a bid to let light into their gardens. One resident, who asked not to be named, confirmed: ‘Some of the residents have taken matters in their own hands and just cut them down. ‘I think they just took a chainsaw to the hedge and did it themselves, they just got fed up of waiting for a decision to be made. ‘The first row of Leylandii is directly connected to the fences of the residents’ houses and that is the ones that have been cut. Ideally they want to cut the hedge down to the same height of their own fences – so to just a few metres high. Fred Goodwin treasures the 25ft Leylandii hedge which is situated at the back of the home and a tennis court owned by the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss . Long-suffering neighbours of the disgraced financier have lost patience and taken a chainsaw to part of the massive hedge at the centre of a row in an exclusive Edinburgh suburb . ‘It doesn’t look very nice as you can see all the dead Leylandii now that has not been able to grow due to no sunlight, that needs to get cut down as well.’ Mr Goodwin bought the exclusive six-bedroom home – built by football legend Graeme Souness – in June 2011 after his property in the nearby Grange district was  targeted by vandals. After he split from his estranged wife, Joyce, she remained at the new address and although efforts have been made recently to reduce the size of the hedge, neighbours still believe it is too high. Another resident said: ‘She should just pay to have it cut down. Fred Goodwin became one of Scotland’s best-known figures after his career in banking took off in 2000 and he presided over the Royal Bank of Scotland’s rapid rise to global prominence with assets of £1.9trillion . ‘We will try and talk with her before we begin arbitration – we should be able to enter one together as residents and split the cost. ‘Why we, the innocent party have to pay, I don’t know, but we will as this dispute needs to be settled.’ They plan to be one of the first groups in Scotland to take action under the new High Hedges  (Scotland) Act. The legislation gives councils the right to force homeowners to cut hedges which are more than 6ft 6in tall if they form a barrier to light. Fred Goodwin became one of Scotland’s . best-known figures after his career in banking took off in 2000. He . presided over the Royal Bank of Scotland’s rapid rise to global . prominence with assets of £1.9trillion. However, he resigned in October 2008 before the bank revealed losses of £24.1billion – the largest annual loss in UK corporate history. His time in charge of the Royal Bank of Scotland left the taxpayer with a multi-billion-pound bail-out bill and earned him the nickname 'Fred the Shred'. He was criticised for lavish overspending while the bank ran up huge losses. And he was vilified after it emerged that he received a pension of £703,000 a year, later reduced to £342,000. The knighthood awarded to him for ‘services to banking’ was annulled two years ago. Local authorities can enforce cutting orders, if owners do not have the work carried out themselves. They can then charge up to £500 to carry out the work if the homeowner does not complete it at their own expense. When asked for comment Joyce Goodwin, speaking on an intercom at the Colinton mansion, said: . ‘What hedge?’ She then hung up. The High Hedges Bill was lodged by Mark McDonald, Nationalist MSP for Aberdeen Donside, at the Scottish parliament in 2012 – ten years after action was first suggested by former Dunfermline West Labour MSP Scott Barrie. Under the law, which was passed by MSPs in 2013, a high hedge is classed as being formed wholly or mainly by a row of two or more evergreen or semi-evergreen trees or shrubs which exceed two metres (6.5ft) in height and which forms a barrier to light. When the law comes into effect on April 1, owners will be required to take steps to resolve any dispute with their neighbours before they contact their local authority for help. If they apply for a ‘high hedge notice’, councils are expected to charge between £325 and £500 for the service. When the Bill was first proposed, it was estimated that there were about 5,000 problem cases in Scotland.","Former RBS boss has been in four-year feud with neighbours over hedge .

"By . Daniel Martin . Actress Amanda Holden, who suffered a miscarriage herself in 2010, and delivered a stillborn son in 2011, is hosting Channel 4's Ending Hospital Heartache . Thousands of miscarried and aborted babies have been incinerated by NHS hospitals without their mothers’ knowledge, an investigation has found. The government was forced to ban the practice after it emerged that 15,500 foetal remains have been incinerated by 27 trusts over the last two years alone. The bodies are being burned as ‘clinical waste’, while at two trusts they were put into ‘waste-to-energy’ furnaces which generate power for hospitals. One devastated mother who suffered a miscarriage was told her child would be ‘incinerated with the rest of the day’s waste’. The scandal of how the NHS treats parents who lose a child in early pregnancy was uncovered as part of a Channel 4 Dispatches programme to be broadcast tonight. Last night health minister Dan Poulter stepped in to order an immediate ban on incinerating foetal remains. ‘This practice is totally unacceptable,’ he said. ‘That is why I have asked Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, to write to all NHS hospital trusts, to make it clear that it must stop now. ‘The Chief Medical Officer has also written to the Human Tissue Authority to ask them to make sure that there is clear guidance on this issue. ‘While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue without delay.’ Cathryn Hurley, 35, found out during a 13-week pregnancy scan that her baby had died at eight weeks, and later underwent a medical procedure to remove the foetus. She said: ‘I was hysterical. I was crying. I asked one of the nurses what would happen to my baby; and she just said - well, it will be incinerated with the rest of the day’s waste. ‘That was really difficult to hear because to me it wasn’t waste, it was my baby.’ The trust involved cannot be named for legal reasons. The programme reveals that Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks’ gestation at their own ‘waste to energy’ plant. Channel 4 programme Dispatches: Ending Hospital Heartache reveals how Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, pictured, incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks' gestation at their own 'waste to energy' plant . Forms handed to women at the hospitals say the remains are ‘cremated’ - making no mention of ‘incineration’. It goes against advice from Sands, the neonatal death charity, which states that incineration, under which the remains are burned along with the rest of the waste, ‘must not be called cremation’. Another ‘waste to energy’ facility at Ipswich Hospital has incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011/12 and 2012/13. They were brought in from another hospital before being burned, generating energy for the hospital site. Ipswich hospital itself uses cremation, and the furnace facility is run by a private company. The programme is hosted by actress and Britain’s Got Talent star Amanda Holden, who suffered a miscarriage herself in 2010, and delivered a stillborn son in 2011. The bodies are being burned as 'clinical waste', while at two trusts - including Addenbrooke's in Cambridge - they were put into 'waste-to-energy' furnaces which generate power for hospitals . She said: ‘I was shocked at some of the discoveries I made during filming. The mothers I spoke to said that despite the best intentions of individual nurses and doctors, they sometimes felt that hospitals weren’t as compassionate as they should be towards them. ‘I am absolutely delighted that the government has announced a ban on this practice. The change in policy means an end to the misery and prolonged anguish of many parents across England.’ The Care Quality Commission watchdog has also said it will investigate the programme’s findings. Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals, said: ‘I am disappointed trusts may not be informing or consulting women and their families. This breaches our standard on respecting and involving people who use services. ‘We scrutinise information of concern and can inspect unannounced, if required.’ A total of one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, while NHS figures show there are around 4,000 stillbirths each year in the UK - or 11 each day. A spokesman for the Cambridge University Hospitals trust, which runs Addenbrooke’s, said: ‘Trained health professionals discuss the options with the patients and families respectfully and sensitively, both verbally and in writing. ‘The parents are given exactly the same choice on the disposal of foetal remains as for a stillborn child, and their personal wishes are respected.’ Ipswich trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal remains from another hospital were incinerated on its site. * Dispatches: Ending Hospital Heartache will be aired on Channel 4 tonight at 8pm.","Investigation finds thousands of miscarried babies have been incinerated .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . As authorities continue to search for the vanished Malaysian Airlines 777, a cyclone in the Indian Ocean is nearing the designated search area off the coast of Perth, Australia. Although Cyclone Gillian is currently well north of the search area - about 2,500 kilometers from mainland Australia - experts continue to monitor its movement in case it bears south. Crews searching for the missing plane have already had to contend with fog and other weather conditions as they search an area known as the 'Roaring Forties' because of its rough waters. With 10 aircraft now in the air searching, the crews are working off images found by both Chinese and Australian satellites, according to ABC News. Bad weather has hindered the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. While Cyclone Gillian in the northern Indian Ocean could bear down on the search area, another tropical storm has come in from the west . Tropical Cyclone Gillian was causing strong winds and rough seas in the southern Indian Ocean where ships and vessels are searching for objects spotted by an Australian satellite and possibly related to Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 . New data: This satellite image, captured by the Chinese on March 18, is of a floating object measuring about 73 feet long by 43 feet wide. It is the second debris to be found in the area after similar data was first found by Australia . The most recent - the Chinese footage, which released on Tuesday - is of an object that is floating in the ocean measuring 73 feet by 43 feet. It is approximately 75 miles away from the object detected by the Australian satellite. Searchers in the air have yet to find these objects or confirm they are connected to missing Flight MH 370. Ships have also been tasked with searching the area. What was believed to be a wooden pallet that could have come from the jet was seen by one plane Sunday, but another search plane sent to photograph it could not locate the pallet. ABC News aviation expert and former Marine Corps pilot Steve Ganyard said even if the storm doesn't hit the search area head on, it can still affect the search effort since crew members may have difficulty identifying debris in whitecap waves churned up by a faraway storm. Additionally, if there is debris from the plane in the ocean, a large storm could displace it, making it almost impossible for investigators to trace the debris to a crash site as they have done in earlier investigations.

Commanding Officer of HMAS Success Captain Allison Norris of the Royal Australia Navy (RAN) scans the ocean from the ship's bridge during the search for the missing Malaysia Airliner flight MH370 in the Indian Ocean on Sunday 23 March 2014 . ABC News aviation expert John Nance said if the cyclone develops closer to the search area it would hinder the search effort for multiple reasons, including decreased visibility and a dispersal of debris. 'If you've got floating debris and the sea scape goes from eight to 10 feet to 40 to 45 feet your chances of sinking that [debris] becomes great,' Nance said. 'The large structures that we have been seeing, if they are indeed from the airplane, are probably very vulnerable to be sunk from the cyclone.' David Mearns, a search and recovery expert and founder of Blue Water Recoveries, said if the plane did crash into the water, weather events such as cyclones would likely not affect the crash site. If the plane crashed where search crews are looking, Mearns said investigators would expect to find wreckage on the ocean floor that likely would be undisturbed by weather patterns thousands of feet above on the ocean surface.

Australian Deputy Prime Minister, Warren Truss (R) chats with John Rice (C), Senior Search and Rescue Officer and Mission Coordinator for the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines aircraft, at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre . 'While it will have been fragmented into many, many pieces, most of that will be on the seabed,' relatively undisturbed, said Mearns. 'A classic pattern, it's probably no more than 1,500 to 2,000 meters in the longest dimension and about half as wide.' Search crews will start the search for the vanished plane on Monday. Flight 370 vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search that has turned up no confirmed pieces and nothing conclusive on what happened to the jet.","Tropical Cyclone Gillian is causing rough seas and strong winds in the southern Indian Ocean .

"By . Daniel Martin . Fraud is costing the NHS up to £5billion a year – the equivalent of 250,000 nurses or the entire annual budget for cancer, a report claims. Dentists charging for patients who do not exist, or drugs being stolen and sold on eBay are just two examples of the corruption. A further £2billion could be missing due to financial error, it is claimed. Emergency: A fraud expert says Government figures underestimate level of loss in the NHS from corruption . The Government records the level of fraud against the NHS at £229million a year – but an expert will tell BBC's Panorama that this is a wild underestimate. Jim Gee, a former director of NHS Counter Fraud Services, says this total does not include examples of fraud such as NHS staff being paid for hours they did not work, or private companies over-charging trusts for operations and other services. He told Panorama that the true level of fraud could be more than 20 times the government estimate. He said comparisons with other countries' health systems had led him to believe that healthcare fraud takes £5billion away from caring for patients in the UK. This would be enough to pay for 68,000 new consultants or 244,000 new nurses. The total is the equivalent of the entire NHS bill for cancer services. Professor Mark Button, of the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at the University of Portsmouth, said the increase in private sector firms doing work for the NHS had played a part in the rise. Patient: The scale of fraud is equivalent to the amount spent on cancer treatment (file photo) Panorama uncovered a whole array of fraud, with stolen medical products being sold on eBay and a GP using patient records to obtain prescriptions for their drug addiction. Other examples include dentists claiming for work they have not done. Mr Gee said he had studied 15 years' worth of international fraud and error figures. If the NHS is in line with other health systems around the world, it would mean it has lost between 7 and 15 per cent of its budget each year to fraud. 'The NHS budget is around £100billion, so that would equate to around £7billion lost,' he said. More than £5billion is down to fraud, with the rest being financial error, he said. If the figures are right, that is around £14million every day. 'If the NHS was only losing  £229million a year it would be doing 30 times better than any other healthcare organisation in the world, something I think is completely implausible,' he said. And he pointed out that the figures only relate to pharmaceutical and dental services, and ignore the losses that might be taking place in payroll or procurement expenditure. The Department of Health told Panorama that it 'did not recognise' Mr Gee's figures. The frauds unveiled by Panorama included Joyce Trail, a dentist in Birmingham who visited care homes and used residents' details to claim payment from the NHS for work she had not done. In court, it was revealed that she had defrauded the NHS out of £1.4million. She was jailed in 2012 for seven years. The figures were the result of research by BDO LLP and the University of Portsmouth’s Centre for Counter Fraud Services .","Government figures put level of fraud against NHS at £229m a year .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporters . An adorable 3-year-old girl who suffered a heart attack during a dentist visit likely died because she was given the maximum dose of sedative drugs, according to an autopsy report. Finley Puleo Boyle, of Kailua in Honolulu, Hawaii, probably died because of the sedatives and local anesthesia that were administered during her December dental procedure, Honolulu Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Christopher Happy concluded in his autopsy report. He classified the death as an accident. The girl lapsed into a coma on December 3 in the office of Dr. Lilly Geyer at Island Dentistry for Children. She died on January 3. The office has since closed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Finley Boyle, 3, died after being given sedatives during a standard dental procedure . Finley Boyle's devastated mother Ashley (right) took the little girl to the Island Dentistry for Children in Oahu, Hawaii on December 3 . The autopsy report said the previously healthy girl had no signs of underlying heart problems or an allergic reaction to the array of sedatives and anesthetic she received in preparation for cavity fillings and root canals, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Friday. The medical examiner noted her teeth were in good shape: 'the oral cavity has native dentition in good repair.' Finley received five drugs, according to the report, including Demerol, hydroxyzine and chlorohydrate. She was also given laughing gas and an injection of a local anesthetic, lidocaine with epinephrine. 'Immediately following the lidocaine injection, the decedent became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest,' Happy said in his report. The girl lapsed into a coma on December 3 in the office of Dr. Lilly Geyer (center) at Island Dentistry for Children . The girl's mother Ashley Boyle (pictured) is traumatized by her daughter's death and has filed a negligence lawsuit against the dentist . Parents Ashley and Evan Boyle filed a negligence lawsuit while their only child was in a coma. Their attorney, Rick Fried, would not comment on the autopsy report. Geyer's attorney, John Nishimoto, has called the allegations 'unproven' but declined to comment further because of the lawsuit. He didn't respond to the newspaper's requests for comment on the autopsy report Thursday. Geyer was issued a license to practice dentistry in the state in July 2005, the Star-Advertiser has previously reported. As of last December, there were no records of complaints against her or her practice on file with the Hawaii Department Of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, according to the newspaper. Ms Boyle is being represented by attorney Richard Fried who called the maximum dosages of five different drugs 'grossly excessive'. He cited the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's standards which warned that young children should be monitored every five minutes and that an extra person should be there to help in case resuscitation is needed. Immediately following the lidocaine injection, Finley Boyle became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest . The procedure on December 3 broke both . of those rules. Instead of checking Finley's oxygen levels every five . minutes, records show she wasn't checked for 26 minutes which explains . why the brain damage was so severe. When . the girl went into cardiac arrest, a doctor from another office had to . be brought in to perform CPR - which Ms Boyle believes is the main . reason her daughter fell into a coma. Ms Boyle was left with the agonizing decision to not resuscitate her daughter, saying that although she held out hope that her daughter would recover she didn't want her to live in a vegetative state. 'Had it been initiated at the correct time, she'd be walking out of the hospital right now,' Boyle said.Finley . may not have even needed the fillings. Ms Boyle has been contacted by . others mothers who got second opinions after visiting Dr Geyer and found . out that her recommendations were 'either totally unnecessary or . somewhat unnecessary' according to Fried. Other mothers said their children had trouble walking for a few days after having work done by Dr Geyer. Ms Boyle calls the botched procedure a 'massive tragedy' that she and her family 'will have to deal with for the rest of our lives.' In January, new state rules took effect tightening oversight of dental sedation in Hawaii. Finley Puelo Boyle (pictured) is tragically missed by her mother, father, and all who knew her .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The former bodyguard of £149million lottery winner Adrian Bayford says he proposed to her just days before getting engaged to his current fiancée. Marta Jarosz, 30, claims the multi-millionaire sent her a text message saying 'I would marry you' while on holiday in the Maldives with Samantha Burbidge, who he proposed to two days later. She said Mr Bayford begged her to go travelling with him instead of Ms Burbidge, but she refused because she was already in love with welder Alex Martin, who she fell for on the same night she met the lottery winner for the first time. Scroll down for video . Marta Jarosz and Adrian Bayford were pictured together in February, leading to speculation they were a couple . According to The Sun, Ms Jarosz met Mr Bayford, 43, on December 20 last year while working as a bouncer at the Rose and Crown pub in Haverhill when he approached her and asked: 'Do you know who I am?' Mr Bayford then offered her a £1,200-a-month job as his bodyguard, driver and personal assistant. The pair swapped numbers, and he texted her later that night . However, on the same evening, Ms Jarosz went for a drink after her shift with Mr Martin and the pair have been together since. Ms Jarosz did go to work for Mr Bayford, but noticed that whenever he took his staff out for a meal, he would insist on sitting next to her. He also told her that she made him smile and feel good about himself, though she insists she didn't know he was interested in her. A few months later, the pair were pictured together walking towards Stansted Airport while Mr Bayford was going to see his children in Scotland, sparking rumours of a romance. In fact, Mr Bayford took the trip alone and Ms Jarosz returned home to see her boyfriend, but says she was banned from speaking to the press to deny the relationship. Ms Jarosz says Mr Bayford begged her to come on holiday with him instead of his current fiancée Samantha Burbidge . Adrian is now set to marry Samantha Burbidge, pictured, a former stable hand, in a James Bond-style ceremony . She told The Sun: 'I realise now that he wanted me and wanted the world to think we were a couple.' She also said that Mr Bayford had trouble enjoying his winnings, saying that his life was 'boring' and he should have more fun. After his trip to Scotland, Mr Bayford announced he was going on his dream trip to the Maldives and insisted in taking Ms Jarosz. But when she found out she was the only member of staff invited she refused, and told him to take a man instead. She says Mr Bayford went quiet after that. The pair stopped talking, and he eventually messaged to say he was taking another girl he had met instead. That girl was Samantha Burbidge, a horse groom 16 years his junior who he had also met in a local pub. Couple: Adrian scooped £149million on the Euromillions in 2012 with his then-wife Gillian . While he was away, Mr Bayford messaged Ms Jarosz twice more to say 'I want you' and 'can't help my feelings', she claims. He also sent another message on Facebook to say: 'I would marry you no probs. I always wanted you as a girlfriend. Would you have married me?' Ms Jarosz simply replied 'no', and two days afterwards Mr Bayford announced he was engaged to Ms Burbidge. When Mr Bayford returned from holiday, he allegedly got another member of his entourage to fire Ms Jarosz, simply saying there was no more work for her to do. Mr Bayford has refused to comment on the allegations, though Ms Jarosz's boyfriend Alex added: 'Adrian is a lonely man and thinks his money can get him whatever he wants.'","Adrian Bayford won £149million with then-wife Gillian in 2012 .

The pilot of a Southwest Airlines jet that landed at the wrong airport near Branson, Missouri in January only knew after he landed that he made the embarrassing error, newly released recordings show. 'I assume I'm not at your airport,' the pilot radioed to the control tower at Branson Airport in Hollister the evening of Jan. 12, moments after the plane came to a stop at the end of the runway at M.

The pilots then said they had the airport in sight, though what they thought was Branson Airport was actually Clark Airport, an airfield that has one runway with a length of just 3,738 feet. By comparison, the Branson Airport runway is 7,140 feet long. Although the Branson controller cleared the Southwest jet for a visual approach, it also meant the pilots were not using the aircraft's navigation system to ensure the correct orientation. The pilots later told the National Transportation Safety Board they mistook Clark Airport as Branson Airport since both runways are oriented in a similar direction and have bright lights.

"By . Tim Shipman . Married: Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and her husband Stephen Kinnock, the son of Neil Kinnock . A Tory minister has criticised the growing trend of politicians' children following in their footsteps. Education minister Liz Truss said having too many MPs from the same family leads to the 'usual suspects' winning elections and undermining the meritocracy. She took aim at Labour's 'Red Princes' – the children of former ministers running for Parliament – but said the problem could be found in every party. Miss Truss spoke out after Stephen . Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and his ex-MEP wife . Glenys, was selected as Labour's candidate for the safe seat of Aberavon . in South Wales on Saturday. Both his parents are members of the House of Lords and his wife is Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the Danish prime minister. Will . Straw, son of former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, has also been . selected as a Labour candidate. Tony Blair's eldest son Euan is eyeing a . seat in Coventry and David Prescott, whose father is John Prescott, is . also hoping to run next year. Miss . Truss condemned the House of Commons dynasties saying the prevalence of . so many related MPs is more damaging than the number of public school . pupils at the top of government. She . said: 'There are some brilliant children of MPs who are MPs like my . colleague Ben Gummer [son of former Tory Cabinet minister John Gummer, . now Lord Deben] but what I do want us to see is a more open . politics… . 'This weekend we've seen Stephen Kinnock selected for a safe . seat and there are so-called “Red Princes” in the Labour party,' she told BBC Radio 5Live's Pienaar's Politics. Miss Truss added: 'It's not just about public school boys or girls, it's actually about people coming from the same family, people who have always been involved in politics, being involved in politics.'

'If . you look at the Labour team we've got a husband and wife in the top . team – we've got brothers in the Labour party as well,' she added. 'What . we want to do is enable everybody to aspire to be part of the political . system.' A recent survey by House of Commons officials found that 57 of the 650 people with a seat in the Commons are related to other serving or former MPs. It includes six married couples, 21 MPs whose parents served in the Commons and three pairs of siblings. The couples include Labour's Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey and Liberal Democrat MPs Duncan Hames and Jo Swinson. In Mr Dromey's case an all-women shortlist was torn up so he could become a candidate and the couple's son Joe, a Labour council candidate, is tipped as a future MP. The Tories are not immune to dynasties. Nick Hurd, minister for civil society, is the son of former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and Jacob Rees-Mogg is son of former minister William, the late Lord Rees-Mogg. David Cameron's great-grandfather Sir William Mount was a Tory MP twice between 1900 and 1922. When he announced he was seeking selection, Mr Kinnock said: 'I have been a member of the Labour Party since I was 15 years old … politics is in my blood. 'But it was always important for me to build my own career before making the decision to stand.'","Education minister Liz Truss warned of 'usual suspects' in elections .

"By . Tim Shipman . Praise: Which? has sided with pensions experts and campaigners for the elderly to back George Osborne's reforms . Britain’s consumer watchdog Which? has joined up with Saga and pension experts to praise George Osborne’s people power reforms, saying they will ‘transform the way people of all ages save for their future’. In a rare intervention into the political arena, the consumer champion claimed the measures will introduce ‘genuine flexibility and choice for millions of people planning for their retirement’. Some Labour politicians have suggested that pensioners could not be trusted to spend their money wisely. However Which? has come together with over-50s group Saga as well as Aegon – one of the UK’s largest insurers – and the country’s most prominent pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann to praise the ‘landmark reforms’. In a letter to the Daily Mail, the experts say Mr Osborne’s decision that retirees should no longer have to buy an annuity have their ‘wholehearted support’ because they mean treating people ‘like grown-ups’. And they pointedly back the Chancellor’s call for people to spend their pension pot as they wish. The endorsement is significant as it is rare for Which? to take sides in a political battle. The letter has been signed by Which? chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith, Adrian Grace the boss of Aegon, Andrew Goodsell of Saga and Dr Altmann. In an attack on the Labour politicians who claimed people would waste their money, the experts wrote: ‘Some say people can’t be trusted to make decisions about how to invest their pensions savings. We disagree. ‘It is good that people who have saved all their lives will now be able to choose for themselves how to access their pension and whether or not to buy an annuity.’ The letter contradicts claims by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that the changes will make annuities – for those who do choose to buy them – worth even less in future. Support: Dr Ross Altmann, the country's foremost pensions expert, also signed the letter . ‘Ending the captive market for annuities will be good for competition, and spur the pensions industry to provide more products and better value,’ the experts insisted, adding: ‘It’s good to see the Government encouraging saving and treating people like grown-ups.’ Dr Altmann also praised the Mail for campaigning to help savers, saying: ‘I do believe the Mail made an enormous difference.’ Last night George Osborne thanked the group for their unusual intervention, saying: ‘This impressive letter confirms that the pensions reforms in my Budget have struck a chord. I’m grateful for the very positive response from the consumer groups and savings industry.’ And David Cameron taunted Labour for its uncertain response to the reforms, branding Ed Miliband’s team ‘all over the place’. The Prime Minister said: ‘While Labour dither and flail around for ideas, we have made long-term changes that will give millions greater security in old age. ‘This is about backing those who work hard, save and do the right thing. And it’s about saying that the best people to look after their money are those who earned it in the first place.’ Labour MPs demanded that Ed Miliband beef up his economic policies last night after his ‘lame’ response to the Budget gave the Tories a poll bounce. And in further dispiriting news for the Labour chief, a survey revealed that voters think he is the ‘weirdest’ party leader in Britain. The YouGov poll for BuzzFeed showed that 41 per cent think Mr Miliband is either ‘very weird’ or ‘somewhat weird’, while 34 per cent thinks the same of Nick Clegg and only 27 per cent believe that David Cameron is weird. Lame response: Ed Miliband has faced criticism for his response to the Budget . The survey, which looked at the public’s perception of the leaders’ personalities, also found 36 per cent of the population believe Mr Miliband would have been bullied at school, a third think he would have been an unpopular student and 57 per cent said he would have been the hardest-working pupil. But the more pressing concern for Labour MPs is that another YouGov opinion poll put the Tories on 36 points, just one point behind Labour, while a Survation poll had the Conservatives on 34 points – also only one point behind. And Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls were still trailing far behind the Conservatives when voters were asked which party they trust to run the economy. A senior Labour frontbencher said: ‘Our economic offering was already seen as weak by some voters. Ed’s lame response has not helped with that. ‘Some people seem to think that we can just coast to victory. This poll should be a wake-up call.’","Consumer group backed Chancellor's reforms in rare political intervention .

"By . Andrew Levy . Tragic: Christian Smith, 38, was killed instantly when he was hit by a suspected drink-driver hours into a 248-mile charity cycle ride . Donations were flooding in last night for a cyclist who was killed by a suspected drink driver during a 24-hour charity ride. Christian Smith, 38, had almost completed the 248-mile trip through Kent and Sussex when he was hit by the car. The married father of three was declared dead at the scene by paramedics early on Saturday. Mr Smith was aiming to raise £1,000 for mental health charity Mind. But by 1.30pm yesterday £1,455 had been donated by 50 people. And as news of the tragedy spread, hundreds more visited his JustGiving donations website. Just two hours later the total had soared to £13,533 from 860 people. Further gifts continued to roll in from generous members of the public, with the total reaching £20,000 before 6pm and £30,000 by 8.30pm. One £1,000 donation came from a stranger who gave his name as James. He wrote: ‘We haven’t met. Like many others, I was very moved by your story. May you rest in peace brother. My deepest sympathies go out to your family, loved ones and friends.’ Mr Smith set off on his ‘Kent Epic’ challenge on Friday and was hit by a blue Peugeot 206 near Chestfield, Whitstable, at 4am the following morning. He is understood to have been less than two hours from home. An 18-year-old woman from Herne Bay was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by dangerous driving. She has been bailed until July 26. On his JustGiving page, Mr Smith, who was married to Katie, 40, said he wanted to support Mind to help end the stigma attached to mental health problems. Donations: Friends have given thousands of pounds to charity in Mr Smith's memory . He wrote: ‘I have had my own . misfortune to suffer from a spate of poor mental health which was . unexpected and has been a real “game changer” in how I now view the . future. It has been a tough road to get to this point but I have been . fortunate enough to have the support of my family and friends. ‘There . are those who are not so fortunate to have the same level of support . and understanding. They suffer in silence and are alone.’ Mr . Smith, from Boughton Aluph, Kent, planned to celebrate completing the . challenge by having drinks with friends next Saturday. He would have . turned 39 tomorrow. On his . online LinkedIn business profile he said he had worked as an operations . manager for a funeral director until December and was now ‘looking for a . new challenge’. His family . said in a statement: ‘Christian Smith was killed in the early hours of . Saturday morning while cycling to raise money for Mind. Christian leaves . a loving wife and three children.’ Mind chief executive Paul Farmer said: ‘We were shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of Christian Smith. ‘Our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.’ PC . Jamie Woodhams, of the Kent Police Serious Collision Investigation . Unit, said: ‘We are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward. In particular we would like to speak to anybody who saw the Peugeot . travelling along the road prior to the collision.’ The . public response is similar to when 30-year-old hairdresser Claire . Squires died during the London Marathon in 2012. She had hoped to raise . £500 for Samaritans, but news of her death sent the total soaring to . £1.2million.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Wanted: Ugandan forces hunting for warlord Joseph Kony (pictured) have hailed the arrest of one of his top commander's as an 'intelligence coup' U.S. President Barack Obama has reportedly stepped up efforts to capture Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony. Kony is the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, which is accused by the United Nations and human . rights groups of killing and mutilating innocent civilians and . kidnapping thousands of children, forcing them to be soldiers and sex . slaves. Obama has reportedly dispatched military aircraft to the central African nation to help track the brutal warlord, with several CV-22 Osprey aircraft arriving in the troubled country by the middle of the week. The Washington Post, which broke the story about the Obama administration's increased effort to track down Kony, reports that the White House began notifying Congressional leaders about the plan on Sunday night. Officials emphasized that the Ospreys 'will be used for troop transport and that . the rules of engagement for U.S. forces remain the same as for about . 100 Special Operations troops that Obama first sent to help find Kony in . October 2011,' the paper reports. U.S. military personnel will be allowed to 'provide information, advice and . assistance' to an African Union military task force responsible for tracking Kony and the LRA. U.S. forces are authorized to track Kony and his forces across Uganda, the Central African . Republic, South Sudan and Congo. The U.S. soldiers are not authorized to engage the LRA unless it is in self-defense. The number of U.S. forces who will be a part of the operation to track Kony are unlikely to exceed 300. Horrific: Kony's guerilla army has abducted . thousands of children in central Africa to join it, forcing them to . commit horrific acts of violence . The new effort to bring Kony to . justice comes as many believe that much of his organization has been . decimated in recent years - especially after a 2012 documentary that . brought the atrocities he's alleged to have committed into the . mainstream media. According . to the Washington Post, LRA attacks have decreased and the number of . people his regime is suspected of murdering has decreased by more than . 75 percent since 2010. Additionally, there hasn't been a definitive sighting of Kony, himself, in quite some time. Kony recently became the focus of international attention after the U.S. advocacy group Invisible Children made an online video seeking to make him famous. Scarred: Kony's LRA has ordered his young army to carry out acts of mutilation on the faces of other youngsters . In 2005 the ICC indicted Kony, along with four other LRA commanders, for crimes against humanity and war crimes. Two of them have since died. In 2011 Obama sent 100 troops to help regional governments eliminate the LRA. But the manhunt for LRA leaders has proved tough, with the rebels moving in very small groups and avoiding technology. Encounters between Ugandan troops and the rebels are very rare. Only about 200 LRA members remain the jungle, according to Ugandan officials.

"By . Sam Creighton . Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani will be extradited to South Africa next month, after losing his marathon legal battle to stay in the UK. The millionaire businessman is expected to be flown to Cape Town on April 7, arriving the next day. He will then appear in court to face allegations he ordered the killing of his 28-year-old wife Anni in November 2010, while they were on their honeymoon in the country. His latest appeal against his extradition was rejected earlier this month by three High Court judges. Shrien Dewani, left, will face allegations that he ordered the death of his wife Anni, pictured right with Shrien . Dewani, 33, from Bristol, has argued that he should not be forced from the UK to face trial until he has recovered from mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. His wife was shot as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town while on their honeymoon. He denies any involvement in her death. Mthunzi Mhaga, justice spokesman for the South African government, said: 'He (Dewani) is expected to leave London on 7 April and land in South Africa on 8 April 2014. 'Upon arrival the National Prosecuting Authority and South African Police Service will cause him to appear in the Western Cape High Court depending on the time of his arrival. 'He will be kept in a medical facility due to his peculiar condition. Shrien Dewani argues he should not be extradited until he has overcome his mental health problems . Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, pictured with daughter, Ami, centre, and wife, Nilan, right, hopes for answers . 'We are working tirelessly to ensure that his return to our shores brings to finality this protracted legal process. We are confident that he will receive a fair trial in our courts.' Commenting that Anni's family will not immediately be travelling to South Africa, her uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said: 'It has taken nearly four years and countless legal arguments which, at times, have driven us as Anni's family almost crazy. 'I can see the toll it has taken on Anni's parents, my brother and his wife.' Speaking today, Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, reiterated his hope that the trial will bring the answers his family long for. He said: 'There is a sense of relief that Shrien is going back, but absolutely no reason to celebrate and certainly no animosity towards him. 'I have said all along and I stick to that promise today, if he invites me to travel with him I will put my arm around his shoulder and do that. 'I just want the truth and the whole truth so that I can begin mourning properly. My wife and I live like zombies and hardly sleep.'

But the 40-year-old is determined to follow his own father's example and ensure his children make their own way in the world. Mr Roberts, known as the 'Kitchen King' told the Sunday Times: 'My dad's philosophy was: ""I'll give you the best start in life I can afford and what you do with it is up to you"", and mine's the same. '[My wife and I have] been really conscious not to change anything. The kids are getting nothing.' He said that he wants his five children, who found out about his fortune from media reports, to be 'happy' and 'normal' in their chosen careers. His daughter has expressed a desire to become a teacher and he feels that she would struggle in her job if others discovered she was sitting on millions of pounds in inheritance. Mr Roberts, who left school with no qualifications, now plans to set up a charitable foundation. Bill and Melinda Gates have also vowed not to leave their £46bn Microsoft fortune to their teenaged children so they have a sense their own career is 'meaningful and important'. Stand on your own two feet: While he vows to give his children the best start in life, Mr Roberts will not give them his cash . Other celebrities to have taken the extraordinary step are Sean Connery, who says his son Jason will not inherit any of his movie millions, TV chef Nigella Lawson and Anita Roddick, the Body Shop founder who died in 2007 without leaving her fortune to her daughters. Having worked for Moben Kitchens, Mr Roberts started the business after a friend bet him £1 that he wouldn’t take the plunge. In an interview with Retail Week last year, Mr Roberts described how AO cut out the ‘convoluted’ supply chain involving a series of distributors to sell directly from manufacturers to consumers. He said the brand initially competed by heavily undercutting the likes of Currys and Comet but later began to focus more on service. He added: ‘We aim to put the customer first in everything we do and are fanatical about offering customers amazing service and competitive pricing.' After the Bolton-based business was floated on the Stock Exchange in February, its value soared to a staggering £1.6billion. Mr Roberts went home with £86million after cashing in 10 per cent of his near 40 per cent stake in the company. The value of shares in his remaining 28.6 per cent stake rocketed by £113million to around £458million – making the 40-year-old the equivalent of nearly £3,500 a second during the nine hours of trading. The total value of the company is now only just smaller than rival Dixons, which makes around 15 times more in annual profits. Mr Roberts, a married father of five, started AO.com after a bet made in a pub when he worked selling kitchen appliances for a distribution warehouse. Melinda Gates and Bill Gates have also vowed not to leave their £46bn Microsoft fortune to their teenaged children .","John Roberts made the fortune when his business went public .

"By . Daniel Martin . 'Threat' Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, urged the government to give doctors more cash . Doctors were lambasted last night for complaining that the GP service was under ‘threat of extinction’ at the same time as demanding a pay rise. The Royal College of General Practitioners said some surgeries could be forced to close because of a ‘toxic mix’ of increasing workloads and smaller budgets. And the British Medical Association said the Government’s offer of another below-inflation pay rise had left doctors with a ‘deep sense of outrage’, and a poll of GPs found that more than half were considering early retirement. Last night, angry MPs said the traditional family doctor service would not be at risk if GPs were not paid so much. Ten years ago, doctors took advantage of a botched contract to increase their pay by a third. The vast majority also opted out of responsibility for their patients out of hours - during evenings, bank holidays and at weekends. Pay has fallen slightly over the past few years thanks to a series of public sector pay freezes, but GPs still earn an average of £105,000 a year, despite working fewer hours than previously. Hospital consultants have also benefited from generous pay increases. Yesterday Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the RCGP, said the critical state of general practice was affecting patient care. She urged the Government to set aside more funding. ‘General practice as we know it is now under severe threat of extinction,’ she said. ‘It is imploding faster than people realise and patients are already bearing the brunt of the problem. ‘This will only get worse unless urgent action is taken to redress the huge and historic imbalance in funding. We can no longer guarantee a future for general practice as our patients know it. ‘We are being seriously crippled by a toxic mix of increasing workloads and ever dwindling budgets.’ A survey commissioned by the body found that a third of people were unable to get an appointment for themselves or a family member in the same week the last time they tried. Dr Baker’s intervention came a day after Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA council, wrote to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the latest pay deal, under which NHS staff would receive a 1 per cent pay rise only if they were not eligible for incremental pay rises. Hospital doctors receive this so-called ‘progression pay’, which is designed to reward the gaining of skills and experience. GPs receive something similar, called seniority pay. Attack: Dr Baker's intervention came the day after the chairman of the BMA attacked Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) over his latest NHS pay deal . Dr Porter told Mr Hunt: ‘Your deliberate conflation of pay progression and cost-of-living uplift is particularly misplaced. Leaving aside the fact that a 1 per cent uplift would in no way keep pace with the increases in the cost of living, incremental pay progression is... required to recognise learning and development in a role.’ Last night Andrew Percy, a Tory MP on the Commons health select committee, said: ‘It’s an odd argument for doctors to on the one hand be complaining about pressure on NHS budgets, while on the other hand be demanding NHS money be taken from patients to enhance their already generous salaries.’ Priti Patel, a Tory MP and member of the No 10 policy board, added: ‘The priority of GPs should be putting the patient first and delivering high-quality local healthcare provision. ‘Family doctors provide a very, very important public service and they are rewarded accordingly but the truth is they need to adapt. Most people work, so they want to see a GP at the weekend, for example.’ A BMA survey of 420 family doctors found that 57 per cent were considering early retirement because of heavy workloads. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘We have cut GPs’ targets by more than a third to free up more time with patients and are dramatically increasing trainees so that GP numbers continue to grow faster than the population.’","Royal College of General Practitioners warned surgeries could be closed .

"By . Peter Campbell, City Correspondent . Philip Green has vowed to undercut Tesco with his new company BHS Food. BHS Food will be launched in Staines and Warrington . The British retail baron behind Topshop and BHS has entered the supermarket price war by vowing to undercut Tesco. Sir Philip Green said BHS Food, which is about to be tested in two stores with plans to open in more than 140, will be 10 per cent cheaper than the UK’s largest grocers when it launches. The big four supermarkets, which also include Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury’s, are poised for a price slashing drive to take on discount rivals Aldi and Lidl. This was sparked by Morrisons, which earlier this month vowed to spend £1billion lowering the price of many basic foods after losing ground to the smaller cut-price competitors. The move led Asda to pledge a similar sum towards cutting price tags. BHS, which is loss-making and has struggled in recent years against rivals such as Debenhams and Marks & Spencer, announced plans to start selling food at the end of last year. But over the weekend the billionaire retailer behind the group said he would slash food prices to become more competitive than major established supermarkets. ‘We know what we’re getting into - the most competitive food landscape for some time,’ said Sir Philip. ‘There’s no point opening up and getting torn apart because we haven’t got competitive prices.’ The group has planned to cash in on the growing demand for convenience stores, which are the most thriving area of the High Street. Around 10 per cent of a large BHS store could be devoted to food halls, Green has said. The trials, in BHS stores in Staines and Warrington, are due to begin imminently and will see branded products such as bread, cakes, fizzy drinks and some frozen items. It is thought that he plans to sell these at parity with some supermarkets, but lower than others. For example a two litre bottle of Pepsi would be sold for £1 - the same as Asda but almost half the price of Morrisons and Sainsbury’s. A 170g jar of Bisto gravy granules would be sold for £1, which is in line with Morrisons but cheaper than Tesco, Asda or Saisnbury’s. He added: ‘On the basis that everyone is going into the high street and convenience maybe it’s an opportunity. ‘If you don’t buy a ticket you can’t win the lottery.’ Sir Philip Green said BHS Food, which is about to be tested in two stores with plans to open in more than 140, will be 10 per cent cheaper than the UK's largest grocers when it launches . He hopes the venture will turn around the fortunes of the chain, which last year posted a pre-tax loss of £71 million. Although industry analysts are sceptical of the potential for BHS to make a major dent in the market on its own, it is thought the foray into food might tempt one of the larger players to enter into a deal with Sir Philip. With a network of 180 stores across the UK, a tie-up with the tycoon would give any large supermarket instant access to a wide range of locations, analysts say. But if the venture fail he could be forced to sell the chain. Aldi and Lidl, both German companies, have thrived in the downturn as families look for ways to cut their weekly shopping bills. They have been the fastest growing of all the supermarkets, according to industry data.Now it is thoughts that everyday items could fall by a quarter as the established grocers try to catch up.","BHS Food pilot in Staines and Warrington with plans to launch 140 stores .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Worry: TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the fact that the gap between the pay of top earners and the lowest-paid has 'soared' in parts of the country is 'bad news' for the economy . The gap between the pay of top earners and the lowest-paid has 'soared' in parts of the country, revealing huge wage inequality, new research has shown. A study by the TUC revealed that the pay gap had widened most in London and the South East, while only Wales and the South West had seen it reduce. The union organisation said wage inequality had risen by 4.5 per cent across the UK since 2000, and by 8.5per cent  in London. An analysis of official figures showed that between 2000 and 2013 the pay gap between the top ten per cent and the bottom ten per cent of earners in London rose by 14 per cent. A similar picture emerged in the South East and the Midlands. The highest top earners were in London where they receive £82,000 a year, followed by those in the South East who are on £57,000 and the East of England where they earn about £52,000. In contrast, an annual salary of about £46,000 puts workers in the top ten per cent of earners in Yorkshire and the Humber and £45,000 makes the top ten per cent in the North East. Top earners in Wales are on about £43,000 a year, nearly half of what those in London are taking home. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: 'This new analysis shows how wage inequality has soared in parts of the UK over the last decade. This growing pay gap is bad news for our economy and bad news for living standards. 'The picture is particularly bleak in London and the South East, but in areas like the Midlands, the North West and the East of England, a significant gulf has developed between top and bottom earners. Gulf: An analysis of official figures showed that between 2000 and 2013 the pay gap between the top ten per cent and the bottom ten per cent of earners in London rose by 14 per cent . 'Unless this trend stops now and more high-skilled jobs with decent pay are created, this worrying pattern is likely to become even more entrenched. 'Everyone must benefit from the recovery, not just those at the top. The TUC wants to see a greater commitment to pay the living wage from both government and employers, a crackdown on excessive executive pay, and modern wages councils which could set higher minimum wages where employers can afford to pay more.' The TUC is holding a Fair Pay Fortnight from today as part of its campaign to raise awareness about low wages.","Study by TUC shows gap has reduced only in Wales and the South West .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Residents trapped in a remote Alaskan town after two avalanches blocked the only route in on Friday could remain trapped for four more days as road crews struggle to clear the snow. Banks of snow about 40ft high were dumped on Richardson Highway, which runs parallel to the trans-Alaska pipeline, on Friday. The weight of snow damned the Lowe River, creating a half-mile long lake filled with 500 million gallons of icy water. Concerns that the unstable dam could breach its banks if snow is cleared too quickly has delayed efforts to reopen the vital route into Valdez, a town of 4,100 people. Road block: Snow from an avalanche engulfs Alaska's Richardson Highway . Dam: A wall of snow is seen spilling across the road and into a river the day after the avalanche . Flood risk: A highway sign warning of slippery conditions is submerged along the Richardson Highway . The transportation department said the highway would likely remain blocked until Sunday at the earliest. City officials were due to do aerial . surveillance of the avalanche areas today to gain a better idea of what needs to be done. The lake created by the avalanche had been slowly draining over the past couple of days, but after receding to 1,500ft it had stopped, a spokeswoman for the transport department said. Crews have not removed snow downstream for fear of collapsing the snow dam and causing a dangerous surge of icy water. Residents living in a 10-mile radius were asked to evacuate their homes and a police siren has been set up to warn if the banks break. Although the road is blocked, residents of Valdez still have access to air and sea routes. A helicopter has been airlifting in supplies and the postal service is reportedly still working. On Wednesday, road crews used explosives fired from a 105mm howitzer to clear one section of road that had been covered by the second avalanche, and a further 24 miles of highway has been reopened. The avalanches were triggered after 11in of rain fell on deep mountain snow. The snow blocked the highway, with piles of snow up to 100ft high, near Thompson Pass and Keystone Canyon. Despite the only road in being closed, a couple from Copper Center, which is about 100 miles away, managed to hike through the avalanches to get their sick cat to the town's vet. Kristina Clark and Donney Carlson were able to get life-saving treatment their pet, Ninja, needed, but the couple were also arrested for ignoring police who told them not to enter the avalanche zone.

"By . Tim Shipman . Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles MP has granted 17 appeals . Rural towns and villages are being placed under siege by the threat of 700,000 new homes in the countryside, according to a hard- hitting report. Almost 200,000 of these are earmarked for supposedly protected Green Belt land thanks to the Government's changes to planning laws, the Campaign to Protect Rural England warns today. Its report reveals that just 84 local authorities – a quarter of those outside London – propose to prioritise building on brownfield sites. A study of planning decisions also . shows that 39 major housing developments in the year to March 2013, . totalling 8,700 new houses on greenfield land, were given the green . light after an appeal by developers – double the number the year before. Some . 17 appeals were granted personally by Communities Secretary Eric . Pickles. In another 14 cases councils simply abandoned their objections . because they feared losing on appeal. The . CPRE claims that the overall proportion of major appeals granted has . risen to  46 per cent, up from 31.7 per cent in 2008-09. The . report has been written to coincide with the second anniversary this . week of the Coalition's National Planning Policy Framework, which . established a presumption in favour of 'sustainable development' to . kickstart house building. But . a third of all councils still do not have a Local Plan for development . in place. These are supposed to give more power to residents and town . hall chiefs to resist unwanted development. The CPRE says the changes have led to an 'unnecessary loss of countryside' and have left some towns and villages facing the prospect of changing out of all recognition. At Kentford in Suffolk, proposals for 340 new homes are expected to double the size of the village. At Warton in Lancashire, 1,365 homes are . to be built in a town of just 3,573 houses – expected to lead to a . population increase of up to 92 per cent. The report says: 'The most recent . Government figures state that there is enough suitable brownfield land . available for 1,500,000 new houses. Emerging and adopted Local Plans . are, however, proposing significant amounts of building on greenfield . land. (Stock picture) Green Belt land in High Wycombe. The CPRE says the changes have led to an 'unnecessary loss of countryside' 'We estimate that land has been allocated for 729,000 new houses, of which 190,000 are in the Green Belt. These sites are often on the edge of country towns and villages.' It adds: 'Many of these “villages under siege” are faced with planning applications proposing development well in excess of the amount envisaged in emerging or adopted Local Plans.' Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the CPRE, said the report provided 'firm evidence' that the Government's planning reforms were not achieving their stated aims. He added: 'Far from community control of local development, we are seeing councils under pressure to disregard local democracy to meet top-down targets. 'Local authorities are having to agree fanciful housing numbers and allocate huge areas of greenfield land to meet them. Where they lack an up-to-date plan, the countryside is up for grabs and many villages feel under siege from developers.' Planning Minister Nick Boles said the report was 'inaccurate, exaggerated and based on a spurious analysis of the facts', adding: 'We have given councils the power to shape where the new homes our country needs should and shouldn't go.'","CPRE warns just 84 local authorities will prioritise brownfield sites .

"A missing six-year-old is set to be reunited with her mother this evening - more than three years after she was abducted by her father and taken to Pakistan. Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson vanished in November 2009 after going to stay with her father, Razwan Ali Anjum, who said he was taking her to Southport. The girl is currently flying home from Islamabad, and is expected to arrive at Manchester Airport around 8.30pm. She was discovered after police issued a photofit image of her showing what she could look like today. Six-year-old Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson, is finally home more than three years after she was abducted by her father and taken to Pakistan . A computer generated image of how Atiya could look now, which is said to have helped in finding her . Gemma Wilkinson, 32, said she been through an 'absolute nightmare' and 'three years of trauma' as the search for her daughter continued. But earlier this week Atiya was taken into protective custody after apparently being found living with relatives of her father in Pakistan. It is thought she was traced after police published a computer-generated image of what she would like now - a day before her sixth birthday in November. The BBC has reported that Pakistani authorities were involved in tracking Atiya down, and that she was discovered in Lahore. A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson confirmed the youngster would be returning to the UK later today. Detective Superintendent Phil Owen said: 'This has been a long and hard investigation which has thankfully culminated in Atiya being on her way home. 'Throughout the three years of her disappearance, her mother Gemma has understandably been sick with worry. She had not heard from her beloved daughter and did not know whether she would ever set eyes upon her again. 'However, Gemma, alongside ourselves and a variety of organisations, were determined we would not give up and remained dedicated to finding her. Thanks to this determination and the help from the Pakistani authorities, we have the outcome we were hoping for.' Separated: Anjum, left, and Ms Wilkinson, right, had an 'on-off' relationship split-up before Atiya was born . Gemma Wilkinson weeping as she earlier made an appeal for information about her missing daughter . MEP . Sajjad Karim said: 'I was delighted to be able to assist GMP to bring . this case to a satisfactory fruition. Two Greater Manchester Police . officers have provided continued support for this case for over three . years but the real credit goes to Atiya's mum, Gemma, who never gave up. 'I am also very grateful to the Pakistani authorities who did the work on the ground to locate Atiya.' Her . father, a former insurance salesman, took his daughter to Lahore on her . third birthday, and told Gemma that she was 'never going to see Atiya . again'. Anjum is currently serving a prison sentence in the UK for refusing to reveal his daughter's whereabouts despite a court order. He . was first jailed in June 2010, and in April this year a High Court . judge handed him a fourth consecutive sentence after he continued to . insist he did not know where Atiya was. Mr Justice Moor imposed a 12-month . prison term after he found him in contempt of a High Court order . instructing him to disclose Atiya's whereabouts. He said Anjum, 28, would not be eligible for release until he had served at least six months. Judges . have previously imposed jail terms of two years, 12 months and another . 12 months in the hope that Anjum would provide information. They have re-jailed him as each sentence neared its end. Ms Wilkinson, a former charity worker, took legal action in an attempt to force Anjum to reveal the crucial details. Anjum, who represented himself at the latest court hearing, indicated that Atiya was in Pakistan or Iran but said he did not know her exact whereabouts. 2003: Gemma Wilkinson and Razqan Ali Anjum meet while studying at Oldham Business Management School and start on-off relationship .

November 20, 2009: Anjum arrested after returning to the UK without his daughter and refusing to reveal her whereabouts .

November 6, 2012: Ms Wilkinson made an emotional appeal for Atiya's return and a photograph of what she looks like now was published . December 2012: Atiya found living with relatives in a village in Pakistan . December 28, 2012: Atiya is due to be returned home to her mother . Mr Justice Moor said he was sure Anjum was lying. The . judge said: 'I am certain that he is in contempt. It is absolutely . absurd for him to suggest that he does not know the whereabouts of his . daughter and he cannot contact her. I am certain he is lying.' Another judge previously said the case was 'as bad a case of child abduction as I have encountered'. Just last month Ms Wilkinson, . from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, launched a fresh appeal for . information on her daughter's whereabouts. She . said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare. As to her whereabouts we know . nothing. We've had no contact. I'm worrying every day, every single day. Everything is affected by it. When I close my eyes I see her. 'I say goodnight to her every night before bed. I . pray she’s okay but we don’t have any proof that she’s okay and no . proof she is even still alive,' she said. 'It’s been discussed that she . could have been sold, but I don’t want to believe it. 'As far as I’m aware she hasn’t been with any family member so I can only assume she’s with strangers. 'To . know that she’s safe, to know that she’s being looked after, to know . where she is. A child doesn’t disappear, doesn’t evaporate. A child is . put somewhere and people know - and that information needs to be talked about. 'She . was so funny. She was a little bundle of joy. She loved her lip gloss . and handbags - as soon as she got hold of my make-up bag, everything in . it was hers. We just want her home.' Ms Wilkinson met Anjum in 2003 while . they were studying the same course at Oldham Business Management . School, and Atiya was born on November 7, 2006. But . the couple ended their on-off relationship in 2008 after Anjum . apparently became controlling and possessive - and when Ms Wilkinson . broke off the affair, her ex swore revenge. During . a visit on the youngster’s birthday he said he was taking Atiya . to Southport but instead, he took her to Lahore where he claimed she . was staying for a week with relatives. Torment: Atiya's mother described the horror of being without her little girl for three years . Atiya was supposed to share a flight . with her grandmother on November 16, but the grandmother came back . alone. Anjum himself returned to the UK on November 20 without his daughter and he was subsequently arrested. He . claimed he handed Atiya to a mystery man called Khan who took her to Iran, . but the supposed middleman could not be tracked down after the address Anjum gave for him proved to be false. Gemma said at the time: 'He's not prepared to back down - he's not prepared to work with the police. 'He's enjoying playing his controlling mind games. It's just sick. 'Razwan is refusing to say where she is, who she's with and he won't say anything other than ""she's in Iran"". 'Originally she was in Pakistan. He won't give the actual location of where she is. 'He's doing this because he has control over me. He knew the relationship was non-existent.' While Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson is not the only British child to have been abducted by a family member and held in South Asia or the Middle East. A'ishah Sabra, top right, was twice kidnapped by her father and is currently being held in an Egyptian village - even though her mother Leila was awarded custody by local courts. Adam Jones, bottom right, was kidnapped by his uncle aged 10 and forced to live with family members he did not know in Qatar. The number of parental child abduction cases handled by British officials has risen by 88 per cent over the past decade, according to figures released earlier this month. And if the children are taken to a country such as Pakistan which has not signed up to the Hague Convention on protecting children, there could be no legal way to return them to Britain.","Six-year-old went missing on her third birthday during trip to seaside .

"By . Emma Innes . Botox is commonly used to smooth out wrinkles, but new research suggests it could be used to help asthma sufferers. In a world first, doctors in Australia injected Botox directly into the vocal cords of asthma patients who were struggling to breathe. Injecting Botox into the vocal cords of some asthma patients can help to relieve their symptoms . These patients also suffered from a condition called vocal cord dysfunction which causes muscle spasms that make breathing difficult. The Botox partly paralysed the muscles, allowing them to relax and make breathing easier. This effect lasted for between two and three months. A group of 11 patients received up to 24 injections, with 60 per cent reporting significant reductions in symptoms. The injections partially paralyse the muscles causing them to relax - the effect lasts for up to three months . ‘Local injection of botulinum toxin - . Botox - may be an effective treatment for intractable asthma associated . with abnormal vocal cord movement,’ said Professor Phillip Bardin from . Melbourne’s Monash Health. ‘Some of our patients had one or two injections, improved markedly and didn’t need any more treatment. ‘Overall, the patients improved because they’re not as breathless as they have been in the past.’ However, there were some side effects with patients experience a softening of their voices. The researchers say, though, that none struggled to swallow after the treatment. Patient Lyn Dowsey, 68, has suffered severe asthma for years. Eventually, her voice box became affected and she felt like she was being strangled. She said: ‘It was terrible. I could lie down, but as soon as I stood up, I’d be gasping. ‘It felt like there was a ball in my throat like I was being strangled. It was shocking. ‘Now I can get up off my seat and move around without struggling to breathe.’ She added: ‘I did ask the doctor if he could inject it into other places to make me look better, but that didn’t happen!’ The medical trial took 18 months of research and a team of 11 researchers.","Doctors injected Botox into the vocal cords of asthma patients .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . Five former employees of disgraced con artist Bernard Madoff were were found guilty Monday of helping to cover up the biggest financial fraud in U.S. history. The six month trial — one of the longest in the storied history of Manhattan federal court — was the first to stem from the massive fraud revealed in December 2008 when Madoff's Ponzi scheme ran out of money and he was arrested. He pleaded guilty to avoid a trial and is currently serving a 150-year prison sentence for spearheading the $20billion con. Guilty: Former aide to convicted swindler Bernard Madoff, Annette Bongiorno, exits the Manhattan Federal Courthouse in New York January 14, 2011 . The case focused on five people who prosecutors said helped him carry out the fraud. They were portrayed as telling an elaborate web of lies to help . enrich themselves and cheat investors out of billions. Prosecutors unveiled hundreds of exhibits . and showcased dozens of witnesses to try to prove charges against . Annette Bongiorno, Madoff's longtime secretary; Daniel Bonventre, his . director of operations for investments; JoAnn Crupi, an account manager; . and Jerome O'Hara and George Perez, both computer programmers. Each was convicted of conspiracy to defraud clients, securities fraud, falsifying the books and records of a broker dealer. Prosecutors obtained convictions on all 33 charges, though only one defendant was charged in some counts. Bongiorno and Bonventre testified for several days in their own defense. They insisted they were victims of Madoff's fraud as well, losing millions of dollars they had invested with him because they believed in and trusted him. Bongiorno, 65, told the jury he once asked how the firm was 'making money when everyone else was losing money.' Madoff told him they could make money in a down market by shorting stocks, he recalled, adding that he believed him. Former programmers found guilty: George Perez (left) and Jerome O'Hara (right) also face lengthy jail time . Clients lost nearly $20 billion, but court-appointed trustee Irving Picard has recovered much of the money by forcing those customers who received big payouts from Madoff to return the funds. When the fraud was revealed, Madoff admitted that the nearly $68 billion he claimed existed in accounts was actually only a few hundred million dollars, and those assets were immediately frozen. Frank DiPascali, Madoff's now-infamous former finance chief, was the main prosecution witness, along with five other insiders who pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. At times, however, their testimony seemed to support the defendants' claims that they were kept in the dark. DiPascali acknowledged that he lied to . Perez and O'Hara 'to trick them into working on the projects that he . needed them to work on.' Larry Krantz, an attorney representing . Perez, asked him if he was manipulating them so they could participate . in the massive fraud without knowing it. 'Yes,' DiPascali answered. Also going away: Joann Crupi (left), who managed clients' investment accounts at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, and Daniel Bonventre (right), former director of operations were also found guilty . In their closing arguments, defense lawyers hammered at the notion that their clients were victims too, losing tens of millions of dollars they had entrusted to their boss. Attorney Gordon Mehler said his client, O'Hara, was ""used, abused, manipulated, lied to, snookered and bamboozled"" by two of the greatest criminal masterminds in history. Bongiorno's attorney, Roland Ripoelle, said Bongiorno 'saw $50 million of what she thought was her own money but was really Bernie Madoff's monopoly money go up in smoke. ... Ms. Bongiorno relied on Mr. Madoff, and she was fooled by him.' Attorney Eric Breslin said his client, Crupi, was a victim of 'the lies that they told her to her face, year after year.' The verdict was delivered after the jury deliberated for about 20 hours over a period of two weeks. The panel was down to 11 jurors after one juror became sick during deliberations and was dismissed. The defendants were described by . prosecutors as 'necessary players' in Madoff's fraud. They said . Bongiorno, hired in 1968, and Crupi, hired in 1983, used old stock . tables to fabricate account statements and other fake records that kept . the Securities and Exchange Commission in the dark. The . government said they also rewarded themselves with tens of millions of . dollars in salary and bonuses, including $2.5 million for a beach house . for Crupi as the con was falling apart while the recession took hold . during 2008. For the rest of his life: Bernard Madoff's 150-year sentence effectively locks him up for the rest of his life - which is painfully coming to an end as he suffers through cancer . Prosecutors said O'Hara and Perez developed a software program that automated the fraud, generating 'information out of thin air,' as one put it. The Ponzi scheme nearly ran out of money at least twice since the early 1990s before finally collapsing during the 2008 financial crisis. Ponzi schemes can only be sustained when money is constantly coming in. The new money is used by those running the con to give funds to legacy investors making withdrawals from their 'accounts.' Once the new funds stop coming in the whole thing collapses - which is exactly what happened to Madoff as 2008 drew to a close. Free-falling markets caused investors to both stop investing in his supposedly well-performing service and also demand their money as they pulled out of equities. They are named for Italian con artist Charles Ponzi, who defrauded Americans of millions in the 1920s. He was eventually deported for his crimes. Statements claimed assets of nearly $70billion, but there was in reality only a couple hundred million. During jury selection, prospective jurors were told that they might hear references to big names like Steven Spielberg, Sandy Koufax, Kevin Bacon and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Hundreds of exhibits and thousands of pages of materials were put before jurors. Also mentioned were Madoff's relatives, including his brother, wife and two sons. A third son committed suicide two years after the fraud was revealed. Madoff, 75, is serving his sentence at a federal lockup in North Carolina.","Five former employees, including longtime personal assistant Annette Bongiorno were found guilty of aiding the Ponzi scheme .

"By . Lucy Osborne . In a country that has always been subject to changeable weather conditions, you might have thought our public transport would, by now, be accustomed to it. But whether it is too warm, too cold or too wet, transport in the UK still often struggles to cope. This was proven yesterday when all trams in Nottinghamshire were cancelled due to frost on the lines. Services were suspended because of frost on the rails but were resumed by 8am, albeit with persistent delays . All early morning tram services were forced to stop and replacement bus services put in their place because ‘ice had built up on overhead lines’. Nottingham Express Transit (NET) said the trams could not run because they could not pick up power properly on the first night that temperatures had gone to -6C for the first time this year. Trams get their power from electric lines suspended above their route. They are connected to the wires at all times by a mechanism which stretches from their roof and collects the electricity. Because of the layer of frost on the wires, the connection between wire and tram was broken and the vehicles were unable to collect enough electricity to power their engines. Trams were reintroduced just before 8am but there were still delays to services until late morning. Richard John Salter posted on Facebook saying it was ‘unbelievable’ for the service to fail due to the ‘first proper frost’. Peter Miles said: ‘So like the too many leaves on railway lines, our wonderful trams cannot operate in the winter when the temperature drops to freezing?’ Indeed, it is not just cold weather that has been known to cause travel disruption in the UK. In Autumn-months trains have been known to be severely delayed due simply to ‘leaves on the line’. And in the summer, warm weather has been blamed by operators who have cancelled services due to the wrong type of soil. In 2011, Network Rail cancelled First Capital Connect services between Ely, Cambridge, Downham Market and Norfolk because dry soil has caused the rails to shift. In the same year, Chiltern Railways scrapped its service from Saunderton, Buckininghamshire to London because the train is too big for the platform. This followed the decision of the company to add a seventh carriage to the service to ease overcrowding, not realising it would be too big for Saunderton station. Also in 2011, travellers hoping to alight at Shepley in West Yorkshire were unable to reach their destination after West Yorkshire Police received a call from a woman who thought she saw a lion.","Services were cancelled because trams could not pick up power .

"By . John Hall . A woman has described the moment she thought she was going to be murdered when a six foot seven inch thug took her hostage at knifepoint for four hours. Maria Carvalho, 25, was just weeks from giving birth when Russell Ireland broke into her home in Ipswich, Suffolk, while attempting to hide after mistakenly thinking he had killed a teenage boy. Last Friday Ireland, 29, was jailed for seven years at Ipswich Crown Court after he admitted three offences of false imprisonment, making a threat to kill, and assaulting a 16-year-old youth. Fear: Maria Carvalho (pictured right with her partner Angelo Paiva and four-month old baby Arya) was just weeks from giving birth when Russell Ireland (left) broke into home and took her hostage while carrying a knife . Ms Carvalho said she had been at home with her sister Maria, 28, and her partner Angelo Paiva, 32, when they heard someone entering their property through the back door. The Portugal-born couple initially thought it was their landlord arriving, but were shocked when Ireland walked into the room carrying a knife. Appearing agitated, Ireland told the group he needed to lie low after attacking a 16-year-old youth at the nearby Chequers Hotel, and then pulled out a knife and threatened to stab Mr Paiva. After seizing the couple's phones, Ireland seemed to calm down and insisted on watching films with the group, with Mr Paiva even making him a sandwich and giving him something to drink. Speaking about their ordeal last October, Ms Carvalho said: 'It was horrible... I was just sitting on the sofa looking at movies on the television and not looking at him at all.' 'I had a pillow in front of my belly because of my unborn baby. It was just terrible...I feared for my life. I was very frightened because he was big and had a knife.' Scene: The court heard that before going to Mr Paiva's and Ms Carvalho's home, Ireland had attacked a 16-year-old boy at Chequers Hotel in Ipswich after telling him he felt like killing someone . She added: 'I felt he could lose his mind and do something... 'He was calm sometimes, but when he was on the phone [to the police] he just snapped.' After making a phone call to his aunt, armed police arrived at the phone - at which point Ireland became agitated again. Cool head: Maria Carvalho (right) said she was 'very proud' of Angelo Paiva (left) as he kept Ireland calm . Describing the incident as 'quite weird', Mr Paiva said: 'He became aggressive when police came here. He broke the baby’s chair and tossed it against the door. He started to become unstable. He said he didn’t like to lose his temper because he loses control of himself.' 'I told him to relax,' he added. 'He was like that on and off... He started making phone calls to his auntie and then the police contacted him by phone,' Mr Paiva went on. Shortly after speaking with the police, Ireland agreed to let Ms Carvalho go as he 'didn't want to cause any distress' to the unborn baby. Using Mr Paiva as a human shield, Ireland opened the door for Ms Carvalho, but became agitated when he saw the police waiting outside. Eventually Ireland agreed to give himself up telling officers he would put the knife down and would be kneeling on the stairs when they came in. Mr Paiva said he had previously been in a similar situation when a knife was held to his throat during a mugging in New York. Ms Carvalho said: 'I was very proud of Angelo. He remained calm and it was the best thing to do.' Ms Carvalho gave birth to a daughter, Arya, less than two months after the incident. She is now four months old. Last week Ireland, of no fixed address, was jailed at Ipswich Crown Court after he admitted three offences of false imprisonment, making a threat to kill and assaulting a 16-year-old youth. He also admitted burglary at Kingsley House Hotel in Ipswich, threatening a member of staff at the hotel with a knife and assaulting a police officer. Guilt: Russell Ireland was jailed for seven years at Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) last Friday after he admitted three offences of false imprisonment, making a threat to kill, and assaulting a 16-year-old youth . Jailing him for seven years with a four-year extended licence period of four years, Judge Rupert Overbury said Ireland had gone on a 'violent rampage'. The court heard that before going to Mr Paiva’s and Ms Carvalho's home, Ireland had attacked a 16-year-old boy at Chequers Hotel in Ipswich after telling him he felt like killing someone. Ireland then walked into the kitchen of nearby Kingsley House Hotel, took a knife from the kitchen and threatened a member of staff who challenged him. Cathy McCulloch, defending, said Ireland 'regretted' what he had done and hadn’t intended to hurt anyone with the knife.","Maria Carvalho, 25, was just weeks from giving birth during the incident .

"By . Sam Creighton . A police riot van 'catapulted' over a car this afternoon after ploughing into the vehicle in a scene described as 'like something out of Die Hard'. The police vehicle collided with a blue hatchback and was left on its side in Jamaica Road, Bermondsey, southeast London. The front bonnet of the car was completely caved in. The van was driving at high speeds to respond to an urgent call but police cannot confirm what call that was . Three people, including a police officer, were taken to hospital by paramedics after the crash . The van is thought to have been racing down the busy road with its lights and siren blaring before crashing into the car, rolling over and skidding around 100ft. Three ambulances attended the scene and gave assistance to five people who escaped with only minor injuries. A witness to the accident, who asked not to be named, said: 'I saw the van rolling over - it was like something out of Die Hard. I felt sick. 'It had blue lights on but I don’t know about the siren. I’m just glad it looks like no one was seriously hurt.' A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: 'At 1.03pm police were alerted that a police van had been involved in a collision with a car, leaving the police van on its side.' Five people were hurt in the crash, four members of the public and one police officer but all injuries were minor . Traffic officers will now investigate what caused the crash on the busy southeast London road . The police initially said six people were hurt in the crash but later corrected this to five. A spokesman for the force confirmed that two members of the public and one police officer were taken to hospital with minor injuries and a further two members of the public were treated by paramedics at the scene. Fernando Grace posted pictures of the aftermath on Twitter and wrote: 'Big accident just happened between a speeding police van and a car at Jamaica Rd, SE16. The police van catapulted over the car!' Melissa Tran, a receptionist at the nearby Hair Candy salon, said she was one of the first on the scene after the crash. The accident occurred shortly after 1pm and has caused traffic disruption throughout the afternoon . Witnesses described the crash as 'like something out of Die Hard' but, luckily, no one was seriously injured . The 43-year-old said: 'I heard a loud noise and was the first to run out because it is two footsteps from here. 'I think it was a female driver and she looked like she was in her late 20s and her companion was a gent in his 50s. 'She was very shaken and so was her passenger but there was no blood and they didn’t seem to be seriously hurt.' A police spokesman said the van was responding to an urgent call but said enquiries are still ongoing into what exactly it was responding to. An investigation will now be conducted into the incident by traffic officers but the spokesman said it is too early to speculate on the cause of the crash or to give an estimate on how long the probe into the incident might take. A man with abdomen pain and a woman with back and abdomen pain were taken to the Royal London Hospital by paramedics and a man with a minor head injury was taken to King's College Hospital. One witness to the crash said they felt 'sick' seeing the accident unfold before them on the busy street . Police can not yet confirm how long the investigation by traffic officers into what caused the crash will take .","The van was driving at high speed responding to an urgent call .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . A teenage boy was killed and a teen girl is in critical condition after they were hit by a freight train while walking to a high school dance, authorities said. The pair were on their way to the Sadie Hawkins dance Friday night while crossing train tracks only steps from a game on a packed Little League field. The engineer reportedly told police they did not get out of the way in time. The boy died at the scene and the girl was airlifted to hospital with traumatic injuries, a fire department spokesperson said, neither of their identities has been released. Horrifying: Emergency personnel work at the scene of a train accident where two pedestrians where one teen was killed and nother critically injured after being hit by a train . The accident happened around 7.00 p.m., and in front of dozens of horrified onlookers scrambling to shield their children from the traumatizing scene, according to the Appeal-Democrat. Parents attending the game raced towards the tracks fearing one of their own had been hit, Marysville Little League Secretary Diane Washburn told the paper. 'It wasn't one of our kids, just get back,' she recalled telling the swelling crowd, adding that her next priority was keeping children from seeing what had happened. 'Once they see that, that can't be unseen.' People who were at the game told the Marysville Appeal-Democrat they heard a long blowing of the train's horn, much longer than usual. Critical: A medivac helicopter arrives at the scene to whisk the critically injured female to a nearby hospital . Every parent's worst nightmare: Police on the scene of the terible accident . 'He honked from so far back there,' a concession stand volunteer told the paper. Another said the engineer honked 'a bunch and a bunch and a bunch.' Investigators were combing the scene for evidence well after dark, according to the paper. The small town of about 12,000 was rocked by the incident. 'Marysville is a small but busy city,' said the fire department spokesperson. 'Everybody knows everybody so it was pretty traumatic.' The Sadie Hawkins Day dance is a role-reversal that has girls asking boys on a date, and the teen girl walking with the deceased boy knew him well. Into the night: police worked the scene well after sunset . He said he knew the teenage girl, and said she had a close relationship to the boy. 'She's a sweetheart,' he added. Washburn said that, despite the tragedy, Saturday's Little League games will still be played as scheduled.","The teen boy was pronounced dead at the scene and the girl airlifted to a local hospital .

"By . John Hall . A teenage cyclist has suffered horrific injuries after being thrown from his bike when he hit a pothole during a charity race. Ollie Pike, 15, swerved to miss a small crater in the road in Cirencester, Gloucestershire - only to steer into the path of another, which sent him flying over the handlebars. Ollie was thrown 30ft down the road and suffered a broken collar bone, a possible fractured cheek bone and a number of deep cuts to his face and head. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Pain: Ollie Pike, 15, was thrown 30ft down the road and suffered a broken collar bone, a possible fractured cheek bone and a number of deep cuts to his face and head . Crash: Ollie swerved to miss a small crater in the road only to steer into the path of another (right), which sent him flying over the handlebars.  He flew 30ft down the road, suffering injuries to his face and shoulder (left) Ollie was immediately rushed to hospital where he was left unable to move after doctors strapped him to a board amid fears he may have a serious back injury. After 12 hours of tests, scans and X-rays, Ollie was finally discharged with his arm in a sling and six stitches to his face. His mother Louise, 44, said: 'It was absolutely terrifying to get a phone call from Ollie’s friends to say he had fallen and paramedics were on the way.' 'Your mind goes into overdrive and you start thinking of every possible scenario... When your child hits their head like that it is pretty scary,' she added. Mrs Pike said that she wasn't far away at the time of the accident, so was able to rush to the scene - with Ollie's friends keeping her updated during her journey. Ollie said he couldn't remember much about the accident but recalls being surrounded by people shouting for an ambulance. 'I was going down this hill that I've cycled up hundreds of times before so I know where all the holes are... I moved out the way for a hole and I landed straight in another one,' he said. 'I remember feeling myself hit the hole and then I don't really remember a lot else, like flying through the air, but I must have done,' Ollie added. Recovery: Ollie Pike doesn't remember much about his accident - although he did not lose consciousness . Ollie is a keen cyclist who rides at least 70 miles a week. He was wearing a helmet when he crashed . Describing the aftermath of the accident, Ollie said: 'I remember only being able to see out of one eye and people coming towards me shouting for an ambulance and I saw my blood running down the hill.' 'It's all a bit hazy really.... I wasn't really in a lot of pain until I got into hospital and the adrenaline had gone,' he added. Describing her son's initial recollection of the accident, Mrs Pike added: 'He didn’t lose consciousness but I think his brain did shut down for a bit to avoid injury.' Ollie, from Chedglow in Wiltshire, was taking part in an event sponsored by Cirencester Ride 24/7 Bike Club on March 9 when the accident happened. The keen cyclist, who rides at least 70 miles a week and was wearing a helmet at the time, was immediately surrounded by friends following his crash, with onlookers providing blankets and pillows. 'Thankfully there was a mountain rescue cyclist behind him, and a fireman a little further back so they immediately knew what to do and attended to him before the paramedics arrived,' Mrs Pike said. 'Luckily Ollie was on a sponsored ride and there were no cars on the road, it doesn’t bear thinking about if there had been,' she added. Ollie was rushed to Gloucester Royal . Hospital’s paediatric unit where doctors treated his injuries and . stitched a deep wound on his right eyebrow. Hole: Mrs Pike said she is shocked that this small pothole could cause her son such bad injuries. The Pike family are now pursuing compensation from Gloucestershire County Council . The . teenager, who is in the middle of his mock GCSEs, was off school for a . week and it is thought his right arm will need to be in a sling for at . least another four weeks until his collar bone fully heals. Mrs Pike said that she and her husband had been chatting only days earlier about a local cyclist who died following a crash caused by a pothole. 'Ollie was so mature about the whole thing, he didn’t complain once, and apparently the first thing he asked when someone rushed to him was ‘how’s my bike?,' Mrs Pike said. Mrs Pike said she is shocked that a pothole could have caused so damage - especially one so small. The Pike family are now pursuing compensation from Gloucestershire County Council. A . spokesperson for the council said: 'We aren’t able to comment on . individual cases, however we do respond to reported potholes and . scheduled inspections of our roads.' Describing her son's recovery, Mrs Pike said: 'He was very brave but it has affected him a lot, he gets very tired now and I think that is all part of the trauma affecting him.' 'I don’t think it will stop him getting back on his bike though,' she added. Ollie agreed that the accident won't be slowing him down, saying: 'I want to get back on my bike as soon as I can... I really enjoy it, I love everything about it. I've been riding since I was about five, I just love it.'","Ollie Pike was racing in Cirencester, Gloucestershire when he hit pothole .

"By . Bianca London . It may be perfect for carting the kids around or moving house but women are decidedly unimpressed by an estate car.

The street-appeal of sports cars and coupes also made them a top choice to impress for more than one in five motorists. According to the new research, younger motorists are particularly fussy when it comes to driving the right car. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of 25-34 year olds said the car someone drives is important when meeting a potential partner. Reassuringly though, it's not all about the wheels. Almost half (49 per cent) of all respondents admitted that the first thing they usually notice about someone on a first date is their smile. Looking to impress?

"By . Belinda Robinson . Back surgery: Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service's Chief Fire Officer Mark Yates, used £3000 of taxpayer money for his back operation . A fire chief who earns £122,000-a-year has been criticised for spending £3,000 of taxpayers’ money to fund a private back operation. Mark Yates, 50, the Chief Fire officer for Hereford and Worcester's Fire and Rescue Service spent the money on surgery which took place at a private hospital in October last year and was part-funded by the taxpayer. Since his operation he has received widespread support from the county's fire authority which said that the money was ‘well spent.’ But critics argue that the high-earning officer should not have used taxpayers' money to sort out his private health problem. A Freedom of Information request revealed Mr Yates had refused to have the routine surgery carried on the NHS after he was told that he would have to wait 12 weeks to have it done. Instead of waiting, Mr Yates spent £5,090 on the surgery and the next month he asked Hereford and Worcester Fire Authority, which is funded by the taxpayer, to cover the cost. The Authority agreed to pay £3,000 towards the operation as well as £240 for his physiotherapy. The fire service he heads is currently facing significant cuts to services with stations at risk of closure and engines due to be removed to help save £4million by 2016. John O’Connell, Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Residents will be angry that they’ve had to cough up to pay for private treatment, when very few of them are able to afford it for themselves. ‘It says something when the public sector top brass don’t use the NHS for their treatment, especially as everyone else is expected to be happy with it. ‘These perks must be scrapped, as taxpayers already foot hefty salaries and pensions.’ But . councillor Derek Prodger, chairman of Hereford and Worcester Fire . Authority, defended the decision saying Mr Yates was ‘very brave’. He said: ‘Before the operation, he did get into work, but he was struggling at his desk, he was very brave. ‘If . he went into an NHS hospital, it would have taken much longer. We . wanted the chief back quickly and it was money well spent in my view. ‘He . had no real length of time off (before the surgery), but we looked at . the figures and felt it was more expedient to get it done quickly. ‘The . Fire Authority took the decision to make a payment towards the cost of . the Chief Fire Officer’s back operation as it was at a time when the . Authority was running a very detailed public consultation which affected . the future of Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service. ‘As . such a significant piece of work was taking place we felt it necessary . to have the Chief Fire Officer back to work and fully fit as quickly as . possible.’ Headquarters: The fire service Mr Yates heads is currently facing significant cuts to services with stations at risk of closure and engines due to be removed to help save £4million by 2016 . But Councillor Richard Udall, who opposed granting Mr Yates the money, said: ‘I think it is shocking that he managed to get this operation virtually fully paid for. ‘It simply isn’t right that the public sector should subsidise private sector health care. ‘Mr Yates clearly is a well paid man, he had a very good salary, better than most and during the meeting I made my position very clear. ‘I don’t think the other councillors and Mr Yates can be surprised at the backlash they are receiving. ‘It was common sense for me to reject his operation being paid for from the taxpayers, it isn’t fair and he should have enough money to cover the costs.’ Burning building: Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service crews attend the scene of a fire - but their Fire Chief has come under fire for using taxpayer money . Steve Gould, secretary of the county’s Fire Brigades Union said: ‘This is very disappointing. We are facing losing jobs and engines. ‘If the fire authority can get railroaded into something like this what is the chance of saving appliances? ‘Yet again the fire service is being dragged to the forefront and its nothing to do with firefighters, it’s senior management.’ In a statement, Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service, said: ‘He (Mr Yates) was likely to be off work for up to 12 weeks whilst waiting for an NHS operation. ‘Where NHS waiting lists are lengthy, the service has previously paid for staff members to be referred privately for consultant appointments. ‘In addition, we also fund other services for counselling and physiotherapy through occupational health. ‘Each instance is reviewed on a case-by-case basis and all options are considered where it is deemed to be cost effective in progressing a diagnosis or treatment to enable an earlier return to work, and shown to be in the best interests of the service. ‘Elected members considered it was in the Fire Authority’s best interests that he was able to return to work as soon as possible and therefore agreed to contribute £3,000 towards the total £5,090 cost of having the operation privately. ‘This contribution was less than the estimated £8,500 cost of additional payments to other officers if he had been absent for a prolonged period.’ Mr Yates, who took over as Chief Fire Officer in April 2010, was unavailable for comment because he is on annual leave until  March 26, the fire service said.","Hereford and Worcester's Chief Fire Officer Mark Yates earns a salary of £122,000-a-year but used £3,000 of taxpayers' money to fund back surgery .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Britain’s towns and cities are in danger of becoming 'bland, homogenous metropolises' like new cities in China and India by the year 2029, a leading planning expert has said. Expert David Twohig said historic areas of the UK's largest towns - including London, Bristol and Manchester - could be overrun with 'identikit' shopping centres, office towers and 'analogous housing estates' within 15 years. Medieval architecture and iconic landmarks are at risk of being 'ensnared' by tasteless architecture as uninspired, cost-cutting developers resort to 'one-stop' solutions to the built towns, he added. Historic parts of the UK's largest cities - including central London, Parliament pictured - could be overrun with 'identikit' shopping centres, officer blocks and housing estates within 15 years, David Twohig has said . The expert said UK towns could be overrun with office blocks and shopping centres like many locations in China, the city of Urumqi pictured . Mr Twohig, head of design at the . Battersea Power Station Development Company, said parts of the UK will soon resemble the newly-built cities of China and India unless urgent steps were taken to avoid a 'collision course with mediocrity.' Writing in his new book, Living in Wonderland: Urban Development and Placemaking, he said: 'Over the next 15 years China is set to urbanise 300 million people and build the equivalent urban area of North America. 'London alone is set to grow by two million people by 2030. This is the greatest period of urbanisation in human history and yet the buildings and places we are designing and developing leave a great deal to be desired.' According to the World Health Organisation, the world’s urban population is set to rise to 6.4billion by 2050. This will create unprecedented demand for housing in cities in both the UK and internationally. The historic buildings of Whitehall, London. Mr Twohig says cities across the world are becoming identical thanks to cost-cutting developers who rely on 'one stop' building solutions . The skyline of Dubai, United Arab Emirates - which the planning expert says has numerous identical-looking buildings. Mr Twohig says so-called 'clones towns' in the UK will affect people's well being and happiness . Mr Twohig warns that such high levels of . urban growth may encourage designers and developers to opt for cheaper . 'lowest-common-denominator solutions'. Housing, offices and shops 'from Dubai to Shanghai to London' are already 'becoming identical', the planning expert says. At the current rate of growth, 'soulless architecture' will transform . the look and feel of Britain’s cities by the end of the late 2020s, he . added. Mr Twohig argues the 'clone crisis' has the potential of affecting people’s health, wellbeing and general happiness. He says: 'The prospect of hundreds of millions of people ending up in nondescript developments without a sense of identity will lead to future social problems: alienation, isolation, crime and more. 'It will also have economic repercussions. Local businesses are vital for injecting money into a community and attracting visitors, while bland developments will rapidly depreciate in resale value and discourage future investment. Mr Twohig says people living in 'nondescript' and high-rise developments, like this one in China pictured, will lead to future social problems such as isolation and crime . 'We are all moving in the direction of a default life; a sort of Zara- wearing model, living in a glass tower, eating Whole Foods, drinking in Starbucks and watching our local version of the X-Factor. 'There is already concern with the rise of so-called ‘clone towns’ in the UK, but the problem is far bigger than this. We are heading towards a clone world. When did life become so generic?' The book echos Prince Charles now infamous 'carbuncle' speech - delivered at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the setting Hampton Court Palace almost thirty years ago. Prince Charles, who is known for his dislike of some modern architecture following his now infamous 'Carbuncle' speech at the Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA) The prince had been invited to present the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture to the Indian architect Charles Correa when he said: 'What is proposed is like a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend.' Charles was speaking about the then proposed extension of the National Gallery designed by Ahrends Burton Koralek. The carbuncle was never built following the speech. Mr Twohig spent two years researching his book by visiting some of the world’s most successful developments and by identifying 'dismal cities' and many 'dramatic, large-scale mistakes'. He argues that quality, uplifting architecture needn’t be expensive and that it would create new districts that residents would be proud of for future generations. He says: 'I am not condemning this form of architecture, for which there is an obvious demand, but rather encouraging more considered thinking in an attempt to fuse money-driven design with an engaging and culturally led public realm. 'My hope is that anyone interested in creating the world of tomorrow will be better equipped to make outstandingly liveable cities.'","David Twohig says within 15 years our historic cities will be 'identikit'

"By . Luke Garratt . A man suffering from a mystery flesh-eating bug that has destroyed his oesophagus, and is so rare that only two other people in the world have it, is questioning how long he has left to live. Russel Carter, 48, from Crawley, west Sussex, lost his windpipe from the rare bug and has no idea where it will strike next, fearing he is living on borrowed time. The unnamed disease could possibly move to his vital organs, which would almost certainly kill him, and he is now reaching out to the only two sufferers of the disease in a bid to find help and answers. Russel Carter is suffering from a mystery flesh-eating bug so rare that only two other people in the world are known to have it . The other two people who suffer the unidentified disease which destroyed Russel Carter's oesophagus live in Florida and North Korea, and Carter and his wife are desperately trying to reach them for answers . Carter, a father-of-two, fell ill four years ago, and has been struggling to speak ever since the bug attacked his throat. His stomach was also affected, being halved in size because of the bug. Because of the sickness he and his wife Cheryl moved their wedding date forward, because he was uncertain about his future. Carter, first fell ill while working an airport baggage handler at Gatwick airport in 2010, developing sciatica and then pneumonia. The doctor's initial diagnosis was a blood clot, prescribing him with warafin, which caused an undetected duodenal ulcer to burst. This meant Carter's organs were flooded with blood, and he spent three months recovering in intensive care. The operation following the flesh eating bug left Russel with no oesophagus and half a stomach, as the former was removed, and the latter stretched to reach his throat using pig skin . But disaster struck when weeks after his discharge, his oesophagus started to close up. Doctors attempted to re-open the windpipe by using an inflated stent to widen it so he could eat and drink, but repeated closures meant this was repeated 27 times over the following year. His oesophagus eventually became so weak it had to be removed, and eventually his lungs were flooded with water every time he drank a glass of water. Pig skin was used to replace the destroyed oesophagus, by stretching his stomach to the top of his throat, halving its size and causing Carter to lose four stone. After it was removed, tests on the oesophagus showed it had been affected by the unidentified flesh-eating virus, which was likened to fistula disease and cancer, with no cure or preventative treatment available. After the surgery, Russel and Cheryl moved their wedding date forward so could celebrate it together, as Russel was deeply uncertain about his future with the bug . Carter keeps the pain at bay with tablets, but is aware that it could fatally resurge at any time. Doctors admit they have no idea how long he will live for or if the disease can ever be cured. Carter said: 'It leaves holes in my organs and the scariest thing is not knowing what is going to happen next. “I might just collapse right now or die at any time. 'Whether I am going to be in pain, whether it will be slow or quick. It’s very frustrating. 'This has made me value life a bit more. That’s why I wanted to get married.. I didn’t want to waste anymore time. 'At the minute I just have to take the tablets to manage it but it doesn’t cause me any pain.' However, Carter is determined to carry on living as normal as possible because he fears he would give up if he stayed at home. He added: 'I’m still in full time work. I can’t afford to just stay at home, being out and about keeps me going. Russel, a father of two first experienced the disease when he was a baggage handler at Gatwick airport in 2010, and has been in a state of medical emergency ever since . 'The doctors don’t have any solution to this at all. Nothing is happening with it. 'A few special treatments have been mentioned but they need a medical grant for it. 'I get told different things every time and I never know what they are going to say, it is very frustrating.' Doctors at Guildford Hospital in Surrey where Russel is being treated say they have no option but to just manage the disease as it develops. Dr Yuen Soon, a consultant oesophagogastric and laparoscopic surgeon, said it is impossible to eradicate the disease and he has been unable to contact any other people suffering from the condition. A hospital spokesman said: 'The Trust is an international leader in surgical training and Mr Carter’s case can be used by Mr Soon’s team and other consultants as an educational tool. 'As Mr Carter’s case is extremely rare, with only two other people in the world also having the same condition, the Trust will continue to support and deliver a high quality of care to help manage and monitor Mr Carter’s disease.' The other two men with the condition live in Florida and North Korea and Russel and wife Cheryl, 55, a security guard at Gatwick, are now trying to get in touch with them.","Russel Carter from Crawley, west Sussex was stuck with the illness in 2010 .

"By . Luke Garratt . A new watch-like gadget can measure UV exposure and tells users when they are about to get burnt, without them missing out on all-important vitamin D. The gadget was created to negate the need for suncream, which protects skin from harmful effects of the sun's rays but also stops the skin from absorbing UVB rays used to make vitamin D. Experts fear such creams have caused a worldwide deficiency. Scroll down for video . The 'Sunfriend' measures UVA and UVB rays and tells you whether it is time to get out of the sun or not to prevent people from getting burned . It is hoped that the watch will help people overcome the problems of vitamin D deficiency. Using the gadget begins by inputting an estimated skin sensitivity, on a scale of 1 to 11. The LED lights lining the watch then illuminate as UV exposure increases. When it is time to get out of the sun, the LED lights begin to flash. Karin Edgett, who co-founded the company producing the gadget said: 'Vitamin D deficiency is pandemic around the world. The watch uses a small sensor and measures sun sensitivity from 1 - 11, before using the LED dials to tell you what level of UV ray you have soaked up . The watch is intended as a way to cut down on the use of suncream, which can potentially lessen the amount of vital vitamin D we absorb . 'There are huge numbers of people who are aware the sun is healthy, but don't know how much they need. 'UVB gives you vitamin D and UVA tends to give you more sun damage.' Vitamin D is important for managing the body's calcium levels and maintaining healthy bones, and has also recently been thought to have an effect on breast cancer, arthritis and diabetes. Barbara Boucher who researches vitamin D at Queen Mary University of London, said: 'This is an interesting gizmo and provided that the calibration is . reasonably accurate, for both the UVB and for the sensitivity to . sunlight, it could be a useful safeguard against sunburn.' The watch does have its shortcomings though, as it only technically measures sunlight on the wrists, and not the entire body . However, she was frank about its possible shortcomings, saying: 'Worn on the wrist, it only tells you about sunlight on that wrist and . not how much vitamin D one might make during exposure, since the rest of . the arms could be covered up.' The latest version is on sale for $50, but is expected to be upgraded with a new version which will have Bluetooth capability linking to a smart phone app. The team that produced the original is also working on a sensor that will be able to differentiate between UVA and UVB rays. Other UV tracking bands are due to be released later this year, such as Netatmo June, a UV sensor disguised as jewellery.","UV watch measures sun exposure and alerts users to possible sunburn .

"By . Ben Spencer . A destructive flatworm is threatening to wipe out Britain’s entire population of snails, experts say. The New Guinea flatworm, a vicious predator that overwhelms snails in a ‘gang attack’, was spotted in Europe for the first time this month. Experts fear that it could soon travel into Britain, hidden in one of the thousands of potted plants imported every month. Killer: The worm is relatively large, about 40 to 65 mm in length and about 4 to 7 mm wide. Its body is however quite flat, being less than 2 mm in thickness. In the Pacific Islands, several native land snails have gone extinct because of their voracious appetite . Matt Shardlow, head of the Buglife Invertebrate Conservation Trust, said the animal and its eggs cross borders in soil, foliage and branches. The flatworm, also known as Platydemus manokwari, eats a variety of invertebrates including land snails. It is relatively large, about 40 to 65 mm in length and about 4 to 7 mm wide. Its body is however quite flat, being less than 2 mm in thickness. The worm has had several effects on the environments it is introduced to. In the Pacific Islands, several native land snails have either gone extinct or their numbers have drastically reduced. Currently, there are no known methods for controlling the New Guinea flatworm. This makes the eradication of the species especially difficult. He said imports of exotic plants had accelerated the spread of other harmful non-native species, including Asian hornets, oak processionary moths, and lily beetles. Mr Shardlow said: ‘A flatworm that overwhelms snails in a 'gang attack' and has caused many extinctions when introduced to other parts of the world has now arrived in Europe. ‘Urgent action is necessary to save wild British snails - the UK Government should close the borders to pot plants.’ He added: ‘It only takes one or two eggs in a pocket of air deep in the soil to survive and a potentially devastating invasive species has crossed over a border and threatens a new country, where there is no strategy to deal with the invader. ‘There is no need to import pot plants into the UK - horticulturalists here are quite capable of growing our own pot plants and selling them on the domestic market.’ Mr Shardlow said that his charity is a supporter for bugs of ‘all shapes, sizes and habits’. Endangered? Experts are concerned that Britain's garden snails could be wiped out if the flatworm is accidentally transported on an imported pot plant . But he added: ‘There are some bugs that we are less keen on – bugs in places where they should not be that are causing damage to wildlife.’ The Government is keeping a wary eye out for the species. A spokesman said: ‘We do not believe that there are any New Guinea flatworms in the UK but we are aware of the threat they could pose to our native wildlife. We are currently assessing the risk and will then consider the most appropriate action.’ Jean-Lou Justine of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, said: ‘This species is extremely invasive. I really hope it can be stopped at the earliest stages,’ adding that ‘all snails in Europe could be wiped out’.","The New Guinea flatworm, a vicious .

"By . Mark Duell . A 15-year-old boy has died of leukaemia just hours after his classmates went on strike when their school banned them from wearing charity bracelets to support him. Joel Smith, a Year 11 pupil at Bilton School in Rugby, Warwickshire, died last Thursday evening - one day after police were called in when 100 students walked out of lessons. The schoolchildren had been told they could only wear 'Team Joel' beaded bracelets - made and sold by his family to raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust - on a non-uniform day next month. Tragic case: Joel Smith, a Year 11 pupil at Bilton School in Rugby, Warwickshire, died last Thursday evening . Controversy: Police were called by teachers when 100 pupils walked out of lessons at Bilton School in Rugby, Warwickshire, after being told they could only wear 'Team Joel' bracelets (pictured) on a non-uniform day . Pupils who wanted to wear the . wristbands in support of Joel at other times were told they would be violating the uniform policy. But last Wednesday, pupils mounted a protest on . the school field. A Bilton . School spokesman said: ‘We will continue to work with our students and . families to support the whole school community at this extraordinarily . sad and difficult time.’ The school added that it would say nothing more ‘out of our deepest respect for Joel Smith’s family’. Joel’s . friends took to Twitter to express their sadness at his death. Charly . McLeod said: ‘Rest in paradise Joel - heaven has granted another perfect . angel. Gone but never forgotten.

My thoughts go out to his family and . friends.’ 'We will continue to work with our students and families to support the whole school community at this extraordinarily sad and difficult time' Bilton School spokesman . Following the . strike last Wednesday, mother Emma Howell told the Daily Mirror that she . would be backing her daughter Laura's participation in it, despite her . missing a mock examination. She . said: 'I support my daughter. The only resolution I can see is if the . school back down because the pupils are very passionate about this, and I . can’t see them letting it go.’ The . school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from the . children to have a non-uniform day for Joel, and he had requested that . pupils wear blue and white coloured clothing. Support for staff and pupils: A Bilton School statement said it was an 'extraordinarily sad and difficult time' Reasoning: The school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from the children to have a non-uniform day for Joel, and he had requested that pupils wear blue and white coloured clothing . Firm stance: Bilton School refused to let its pupils wear a charity bracelet in support of the pupil every day . This . was planned for April 11, but the school also told pupils that the . bracelets could only be sold and worn on that day - a policy which caused much anger among the children last week. A . spokesman said: ‘We spoke to students and said that they could show . their support by attaching the bracelets to bags or keys but not wear . them as bracelets, in order to comply with our policies. ‘This . has been the topic of quite extensive social media comment over the . last two days, culminating in a call from students and parents for . students to strike yesterday [last Wednesday]. ‘Although . this was a largely peaceful event, we called the police who supported . us in evaluating the safety of staff and students, which is paramount to . us.’ Punishment: The school said it explained to the students how it was helping Joel and his family, and those who quickly returned to lessons would make up the lost learning time during detentions . Doing their bit: The school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from students to have a non-uniform day for Joel, and he had requested that students wear blue and white coloured clothing . The school added that . it then told pupils how it was helping Joel and his family - and the . many of them who quickly returned to lessons would make up the lost . learning time during detentions. But . the spokesman continued: ‘There were a small minority of students whose . actions can only be described as anti-social and potentially dangerous . who used this as an opportunity to be disruptive. ‘These . students were putting pressure on others not to go back into classrooms . and contacted the press. We will be evaluating the actions we will be . taking with these students over the next few days.’ The Facebook page 'Spotted: Rugby Town' had been inundated with angry comments when the ban on bracelets was announced, with some people branding the decision 'disgraceful'.","Joel Smith died last Thursday, one day after pupil protest on Wednesday .

"Desperate: Debra Wilson was pushed to the brink of suicide by unscrupulous loan sharks . Easy credit has turned Britain into a nation of debtors and we are currently £158billion in the red. Nine million of us have serious financial problems due to personal borrowing, and desperate families are increasingly turning to controversial pay day loans and loan 'sharks' just to make ends meet. Debra Wilson, a mother-of-four from Stanley in County Durham, is one woman whose life has been turned upside down by some ill-thought-out borrowing. In . December 2000 money was tight for Debra and her care worker husband . Kevin. They borrowed £500 from a family friend to help make Christmas a . bit more special for their four children. Debra, who features . on tonight's Channel 5 show 'My Spiral Into Debt Hell', described how Robert Reynolds, an old school friend known to them as 'Harpo' first talked them into . taking out a small loan: 'He just said that he had someone . that could lend us £500. We went for it, we were never told there would . be any interest added at all. 'We thought we were just paying the £500 back. We thought he was our friend.' Soon . after Christmas Reynolds' 'contact' was demanding that double the amount . of the original loan was paid back, and with no means of raising the . funds the Wilson family began incurring huge interest charges. As . the months went by the debt spiralled out of control, and was to end up . costing Debra her home, her health and almost her life. After . years of paying off up to £1,000 in interest each month, and being no . closer to clearing the debt, the threats started and Reynolds suggested . that he might have to sell the debt on to people who might damage their . home, or even worse, physically attack Debra and her family. She . says: 'I wasn't coping very well. I had trouble going to sleep. The . stress was really getting to my health. In 2005 I ended up having a . stroke.' Snowball: The mother-of-four ended up paying back over £100,000 on a £500 loan and her story is featured on Channel 5 show 'My Spiral Into Debt Hell' Debra recovered from the stroke but there was no escaping the debt. Their 'friend' was now demanding £1200 per month. Soon they were taking equity out of the house to pay the loan, as well as handing over any extra money that they earned. Over the next few years Debra suffered four more strokes and a brain hemorrhage . Debra says: 'I actually thought about taking tablets and ending it all. I was upstairs with them in my hand. 'If it hadn't been for my youngest shouting up to me just at that point I think I would have taken those tablets.' After an incredible eight years of living in fear, and making repayments of £128,000, Debra finally broke her silence and told local police. It . took her three days to describe the extent of the loan sharks extortion. When the police arrived at Reynolds' house they found hi-tech . TV and stereo equipment as well as piles of designer clothes and luxury . furniture and fittings. He had been spending Debra's money living the . high life whilst her and her family lived in fear. Money worries: Candice Smith and Bryan White are two other debtors who appear in the Channel 5 show . Reynolds went on trial in August 2009 and after pleading guilty to harassment was sentenced to 51 weeks in prison, suspended . for two years, so he never actually faced time in prison. He was ordered to pay Debra £1,500, which is less than the amount she had been paying him every month before he was held to account. She says: 'If I hadn't revealed my story to police I would still be paying today. He should be in prison. I felt like I was in prison for ten years.'","As a nation British people are £158billion in debt .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Tragic: Christian Smith, 38, was killed instantly when he was hit by a suspected drink-driver hours into a 248-mile charity cycle ride . A second teenager has been arrested by officers investigating death of a cyclist who was hit and killed by a car during a charity ride at the weekend. Christian Smith, 38, had almost completed the 248-mile, 24-hour trip through Kent and Sussex when he was hit by a car and declared dead at the scene in the early hours of Saturday. Today, police said they had arrested a 19-year-old man from Herne Bay, in Kent, on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. They have already arrested an 18-year-old woman on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by dangerous driving, and both have been released on bail pending further investigations. Mr Smith, a married father of three from Boughton Aluph, Kent, was declared dead at the scene by paramedics early on Saturday. He was aiming to raise £1,000 for mental health charity Mind with his Kent Epic 24-hour ride. By 1.30pm yesterday, £1,455 had been donated by 50 people, but as news of the tragedy spread, hundreds more visited his JustGiving donations website, and by lunchtime today, the total stood at more than £52,000. One £1,000 donation came from a stranger who gave his name as James. He wrote: ‘We haven’t met. Like many others, I was very moved by your story. May you rest in peace brother. My deepest sympathies go out to your family, loved ones and friends.’ Mr Smith set off on his ‘Kent Epic’ challenge on Friday and was hit by a blue Peugeot 206 near Chestfield, Whitstable, at 4am the following morning. He is understood to have been less than two hours from home. An 18-year-old woman from Herne Bay was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by dangerous driving. She has been bailed until July 26. On his JustGiving page, Mr Smith, who was married to Katie, 40, said he wanted to support Mind to help end the stigma attached to mental health problems. He wrote: ‘I have had my own . misfortune to suffer from a spate of poor mental health which was . unexpected and has been a real “game changer” in how I now view the . future. It has been a tough road to get to this point but I have been . fortunate enough to have the support of my family and friends. Wellwishers have given thousands of pounds to mental health charity, Mind, in Mr Smith's memory . ‘There . are those who are not so fortunate to have the same level of support . and understanding. They suffer in silence and are alone.’ Mr . Smith planned to celebrate completing the . challenge by having drinks with friends next Saturday. He would have . turned 39 tomorrow. On his . online LinkedIn business profile, he said he had worked as an operations . manager for a funeral director until December and was now ‘looking for a . new challenge’. His family . said in a statement: ‘Christian Smith was killed in the early hours of . Saturday morning while cycling to raise money for Mind. Christian leaves . a loving wife and three children.’ Mind chief executive Paul Farmer said: ‘We were shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of Christian Smith. ‘Our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.’ PC . Jamie Woodhams, of the Kent Police Serious Collision Investigation . Unit, said: ‘We are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward. In particular we would like to speak to anybody who saw the Peugeot . travelling along the road prior to the collision.’ The . public response is similar to when 30-year-old hairdresser Claire . Squires died during the London Marathon in 2012. She had hoped to raise . £500 for Samaritans, but news of her death sent the total soaring to . £1.2million.

"Two babies who couldn't breathe have been fitted with a revolutionary new 'throat splint' made on a 3D printer. Both Garrett Peterson, 18 months, from Utah, and Kaiba Gionfriddo, two, from Ohio, were born with a condition called tracheomalacia, making their tracheas susceptible to collapsing and cutting off their air supplies, meaning they could potentially suffocate. Doctors from the University of Michigan created a 3D printed splint to support the trachea, acting as a type of scaffold and allowing for the area around it to heal. Garrett Peterson was born with a weakened trachea, making him prone to suffocation. Thanks to a new 3D printed splint he is recovering and is able to breathe more easily . The 3D printed larynx support, which was created in four hours from a special plastic that will expand and grow while the patient does. In three years it will be completely dissolved, meaning it will not need to be removed surgically . Another advantage of the revolutionary technique is that, much like dissolvable stitches, they are broken down and absorbed by the body, meaning there is no need for further surgery to have them removed. Made from a material called Polycaprolactone, the splints are completely bio-compatible and the patient does not need immune-suppresants. 3D printing is already used in the construction industry, to make guns, artwork and other miscellaneous items. Now it has proven uses in surgery and medicine. The splint was created by the doctors at the University of Michigan, who began by taking CT scans of Garrett's throat and used a CAD machine and a 3D printer to make the device . Surgeons carry out the eight-hour procedure on Garrett. despite his poor health, the operation went well . The splint will stay in Garrett's throat for three years before it is completely absorbed by the body, allowing for his trachea and windpipe to grow stronger . Garrett was born with a defective windpipe meaning that the slightest incident - from an accidental jostle to getting upset or crying - could cut off his breathing. His mother Natalie Peterson from Layton, Utah, said: 'He could go from being totally fine to turning blue sometimes - not even kidding - in 30 seconds. 'It was so fast, really scary. 'When he got upset or even sometimes just with a diaper change, he would turn completely blue and that was terrifying.' His father Jake said: 'It's just been issue after issue with breathing, and just trying to keep him breathing at all.' The same issue affected little Kaiba, whose parents April and Bryan were also desperate for a solution. Doctors gave Garrett a low chance of recovery but he has grown stronger since the successful procedure . Mrs Gionfriddo said: 'Quite a few doctors said he had a good chance of not leaving the hospital alive. 'At that point, we were desperate. Anything that would work, we would take it and run with it,' she said. The Petersons and the Gionfriddos turned to Dr Glenn Green and Dr Scott Hollister at the University of Michigan, who were developing 3D printing technology for medicine, using a machine that melts particles of plastic dust with a laser to craft shapes. Doctors believe the technique could have other uses in medicine, including bone grafts and replacing body parts . Because Garrett was a lot sicker, doctors had a lot less time to carry out the procedure of fitting the tube-like device. They did a CT scan of his windpipe so an exact replica could be printed. Dr Hollister said: 'In some sense we were thrown directly into the fire. 'We characterized it as sort of a Hail Mary pass. 'It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe . and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to . open it up directly.' While the technology is revolutionary, it requires open-chest surgery to implant the splint. The splint is made out of a special type of plastic called Polycaprolactone, which, like dissolvable stitches, will be be absorbed by the body over time, so will not require surgery to remove it . Dr Green said: '(Garrett's) condition was critical. It was urgent and things needed to be done . quickly. It was highly questionable whether he would survive and how . long he would survive.' After an eight-hour surgery, Garrett was on the road to recovery and his parents said he had grown stronger. His splint is designed to grow and expand as he gets bigger and will dissolve completely within three years.","Two children suffered from weak tracheas, meaning they were a high risk of suffocating .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A five-week-old puppy found locked in a fridge has been nursed back to health after being re-homed by a butcher. German Shepherd Elsa was found in an abandoned fridge on scrubland in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. The animal suffered deformities to her front legs as a result of being trapped for more than 24-hours. Fighting fit: Elsa the German Shepherd was found trapped in a fridge dumped on scrubland two months ago . Dumped: The puppy was found with deformities to her legs after being trapped in the fridge for 24 hours . RSPCA officers who rescued her feared she may struggle to walk due to her injuries. Now, two months later, the puppy has been nursed back to health on a diet of quality meat thanks her new owner butcher Suzanne Marsden. Mrs Marsden, who works at Fraser’s Butchers in Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'It was heartbreaking to think Elsa had just been left on her own in a fridge where she couldn’t get out. 'She was so tiny and so scared but she’s now a different dog, and she’s certainly not short of love. Hungry pup: Elsa has now been re-homed by the Marsden family - who are butchers. Mrs Marsden says the hungry dog loves eating scraps of meat she brings home from work . Walkies! Elsa, 13 weeks, enjoys the sunshine while out for a walk near to her new home in Manchester . 'I bring her home pieces of scrap meat and bones from work to fatten her up, and she’s turning into a really lovely dog.' Mrs . Marsden and her husband Paul had previously owned German shepherds. Sadly, they had to have their last dog Sadie put down last year. The couple, who have two children, were approached by Julie Ashcroft, manager of the RSPCA branch in Bolton, to see if they would like to give Elsa a home. Back to normal: Despite the RSPCA thinking Elsa may be unable to walk after her trauma, her legs have healed . New start: The puppy's new owners say they 'fell in love' with the German Shepherd as soon as she moved in . Mrs Marsden said: 'We have had German Shepherds before so when we heard about Elsa, we knew she was perfect for us. 'We . fostered her first to see if she was right for us and to see how her . legs would heal, but she got on with us brilliantly and there was no way . we could have let her go. 'We . kept her fed and rested and we fell in love with her fighting spirit . that had got her through the rough time she’d had in her short life.' Elsa, who is now 13-weeks-old, no longer has any problems with her front legs, despite previously struggling to walk. Julie Ashcroft said: 'Elsa has been through such an ordeal. We have to thank Mr and Mrs Marsden as they fostered her when we didn’t know what the outcome would be with her legs. 'They fostered her and fell in love with her. It has been a real happy ending. 'When Elsa was rescued she was very quiet as she was too young to be taken away from her mum. She slept a lot when she first came to the RSPCA but now she has trebled in size. She is a monkey now.'","Elsa was found two months ago in fridge left dumped on scrubland .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Adolfo Suarez, Spain's first elected prime minister after General Franco's dictatorship, has died aged 81 . Adolfo Suarez, Spain's first democratically elected prime minister after decades of right-wing dictatorship under General Francisco Franco, has died aged 81. Suarez died yesterday afternoon in Madrid's Cemtro Clinic hospital, after a decade suffering from Alzheimer's disease for a decade. The cause of death was 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease made worse within the context of Alzheimer's disease,' said Dr Isabel de la Azuela. Suarez had been admitted to the hospital on Monday with pneumonia. On Friday, his son Adolfo said his condition had deteriorated and that he was expected to die within days. King Juan Carlos, in a televised address, expressed his gratitude to Suarez for his 'loyalty to the crown' and sadness over his death. 'Suarez was a statesman who put the whole of the Spanish nation ahead of his personal and party interests,' the king said. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said 'one of the great men of our era has left us,' and declared three days of national mourning. UK Prime Minister David Cameron added his own tribute, saying: 'Saddened to hear that Adolfo Suarez has died. He was a great leader who led Spain on the difficult path from dictatorship to democracy.' At the start of the 'El Clasico' football match between Real Madrid and Barcelona last night, the players observed a minute's silence in honour of the statesman's historic achievements. Suarez became secretary-general of the National Movement, which was Spain's only party during Franco's rule, and also was director-general of state television broadcaster TVE. He was 43 when he was chosen in 1976 by King Juan Carlos to lead the country toward a democratic parliamentary monarchy after Franco's death a year earlier. Suarez had the king's trust and the two were close. 'King Juan Carlos chose Suarez because he knew him, had followed his career since he was Civil Governor, knew how he thought, knew his daring, his loyalty and because Suarez had hit the nail on the head by including the words democracy and monarchy in the same broadcast package,' said Fernando Onega, a who served in Suarez's cabinet. During his term, which lasted from 1976 until 1981, he introduced a democratic constitution, legalised political parties, and brought back trade unions . Despite opposition to his appointment from many centrist and leftist politicians, Suarez and the Democratic Center Union party he had founded won the first post-Franco elections the following year. Under Suarez's leadership the new Parliament approved a democratic constitution in 1978, a milestone that caused a surge in popularity which swept him and his party to election victory the following year. During his time in office, Suarez surprised his critics and antagonised the army and church by legalising political parties and trade unions and calling for an amnesty for political offences. Suarez was considered a skilled and determined crisis manager during the transition to democracy, but proved to be less successful as a day-to-day organizer. Eventually - after becoming increasingly reclusive - he lost the support of his party and resigned as leader in 1981. Suarez, however, had one more dramatic moment to play. Suarez had been suffering with Alzheimer's since 2005, and was taken into hospital with pneumonia on Friday. After being admitted to hospital his condition worsened and he died this afternoon . Suarez (seen here taking office in 1976) was put forward for the position by King Juan Carlos (rear, centre) who praised his 'loyalty to the crown' during a televised address earlier today . About a month after his resignation, during a Parliamentary debate on swearing in a successor, paramilitary Civil Guard police backed by army generals nostalgic for Franco's hard-line rule stormed the ornate chamber in an attempted coup. When some of the officers started firing submachine guns at the ceiling - the bullets have been left there as a reminder of that day - most lawmakers scrambled for cover, diving to the floor or hiding under the seats. Suarez was one of a handful of politicians who remained seated, upright and defiant. The coup bid soon collapsed. Suarez ran for election again in 1982 and lost. He eventually formed another centrist party, but it remained marginal and he retired from politics in 1991. Adolfo, one of Suarez's sons, revealed in 2005 that his father had Alzheimer's disease. A minute's silence was held for Suarez at the start of this evening's Real Madrid v Barcelona match . Suarez' son, Adolfo Suarez Illana (second left) and current prime minister Mario Rajoy (right), leave the clinic following the former leader's death . Born on September 25, 1932, Suarez studied law at Spain's prestigious Salamanca University and went into politics after graduating. He held several government posts during the Franco regime. The king granted him the title of Duke of Suarez in 1981. He was awarded Spain's highly regarded Prince of Asturias prize in 1996 for his contribution to democracy. Suarez is survived by daughter Sonsoles, a former TV news anchor, and son Adolfo, a politician with the conservative Popular Party, and two other children. His wife, Amparo Illana, and eldest daughter, Marian Suarez Illana, died of cancer in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","Adolfo Suarez, former Prime Minister of Spain, has died aged 81 .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Many parents dread the moment when they have to explain the birds and the bees to their children. But in Emma Thompson’s case, they simply enlisted the help of a rather famous family friend. When she was just eight years old, the 54-year-old was given a sex education lesson by legendary actor Alec Guinness. Emma Thompson, left, got a 'calm' response when she questioned Alec Guinness, right, about the facts of life . The actress - who has previously admitted creating a ‘sex handbook’ for her own 13-year-old daughter - received a ‘calm and accurate response’ when she asked him for details, her mother has revealed. Phyllida Law, who is also an actress, said she felt ‘faint’ at the time, but admitted she and her husband Eric were equally forthright when it came to educating their two daughters about the facts of life. The 81-year-old told the Sunday Times Style magazine: ‘I think I drew pictures. My husband was blunt and I did the diagrams. I think we laughed. Phyllida Law, Miss Thompson's mother, felt faint when her daughter began questioning Mr Guinness . ‘Sex is ridiculous behaviour from adults who tell you not to pick your nose. Emma, aged eight, once asked Alec Guinness about the details and he gave her a calm and accurate response: very helpful, though I felt a bit faint. ‘Sophie, then five, listened gravely, fixing him with her headlamp eyes.’ In an interview last year Miss Thompson, who has won two Oscars and two Baftas, revealed she was sexually abused by a children’s magician at her eighth birthday party. She said the ‘old man’ offered her a sweet before sticking his tongue down her throat, adding: ‘He gave me the sweet and said, “Will you give me a kiss?” and I said yes. So I went up to kiss him on the cheek and he planted his mouth on mine, stuck his tongue in my mouth and wiggled it about. ‘I thought it was my fault - children always think it’s their fault.’  Miss Thompson also said she had created a sex handbook to arm her daughter Gaia, 13, against material she might find on the internet. She said: ‘I drew pictures and said, you know, you can sometimes feel things in your loins you don’t feel in your heart, and you need to look at that. ‘If you listen to what’s going on in your emotional language, you will be able to keep the sexual activities safe.’ Miss Law, whose most recent TV appearance was in ITV drama Foyle’s War, revealed her second daughter, actress Sophie Thompson, 52, has equally curious children. She said: ‘My grandson Walter, while at school, did a picture of a lighthouse, which his teacher took to be quite another thing. ‘She was not amused. Such a pity. A good laugh with a teacher on this difficult subject would be very valuable. I think she missed a trick.","Alec Guinness gave 'calm and accurate' answers to Emma Thompson .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hillary Clinton said she was concerned about the direction the U.S. is heading in, but refused to say on Saturday whether she will be making a bid to steer it back on course. The former Secretary of State was answering questions at a Clinton Global Initiative University forum, chaired by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel in Arizona. As well as talking politics - and dodging questions about any possible 2016 presidential bid - Clinton, who was joined by former President Bill Clinton, and daughter Chelsea, posed for an Oscar-style selfie with Kimmel. Trend: The Clintons and Jimmy Kimmel pose for a selfie, as they recreate the Oscar picture tweeted by Ellen . Question time: Jimmy Kimmel speaks to the Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, at a student conference . During the forum, Clinton was asked by University of California student Vrinda Agrawal: 'If you . don't represent women in politics in America as a future president, who . will?' More than 1,000 . students roared with approval and applauded while former President Bill . Clinton smiled, whispered into Kimmel's ear and clapped. The former First Lady however, said she appreciated the sentiment but said she was still deciding. 'I am very much concerned about the direction of our country, and it's not just who runs for office but what they do when they get there and how we bring people together and particularly empower young people so we can tackle these hard decisions,' Clinton said. Kimmel playfully interjected: 'She wants an answer!' Clinton smiled and asked the student to 'give me your name and number'. Agrawal responded: 'I will proudly run your campaign!' Special guests: Kimmel with Chelsea Clinton, who is vice-chairman of the Clinton Foundation . Family time: Bill and Hillary Clinton spoke about how they met at Yale and what TV shows they enjoy . Clinton told the audience that she was 'obviously thinking about all kinds of decisions'. The exchange came during a wide-ranging interview with the Clintons and their 34-year-old daughter. The host of Jimmy Kimmel Live jokingly asked the former First Lady: 'If you do run for president, will you reuse the old Clinton campaign lawn signs?' The interview covered light topics like how the Clintons met at Yale Law School, the family's favorite TV shows - the former president said they enjoyed PBS's Antiques Roadshow - along with their upbringing and policy issues. Diving into the thorny issue of climate change, Hillary Clinton said young people understood the significant threat of global warmin,g and that she hoped there would be a mass movement that demands political change. She said the generation of college students and young people were much more committed to doing something to address climate change, and it wasn't 'just some ancillary issue' but will determine the quality of life for countries around the globe. Recycle: Hillary was asked if she would reuse Bill's old Clinton campaign signs if she does decide to run . 'I'm hoping there will be this mass movement that demands political change, that makes what public officials do on dealing with carbon emissions ... a voting issue,' Clinton said. While no 2016 presidential plans were disclosed, the family talked about the importance of perseverance in life and politics. Hillary Clinton said many people give up if they don't succeed right away, but 'that's often the best time for what you can learn about yourself'. She noted that her husband lost his first political race; she never expected to run for office and then won a Senate seat representing New York. 'But then I had a big loss which we all remember,' Clinton said. 'You just have to decide what you really care about.'","Former Secretary of State says she is concerned about U.S. but refused to say if she will run .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Crews are battling to clean up a major U.S. shipping channel in Texas after a barge carrying almost one million gallons of thick, sticky oil collided with a ship in Galveston Bay near Houston, threatening an important shorebird habitat. No timetable has been set to reopen the waterway after nearly 170,000 gallons of tar-like oil spilled on Saturday, creating a huge oil slick. But on Monday, more help was being called in to contain the spill and protect wildlife. A barge carrying about 900,000 gallons of the heavy oil collided with a ship in the busy Houston Ship Channel, spilling as much as a fifth of its cargo into one of the world's busiest waterways for moving petrochemicals, according to the Coast Guard. Oil had been detected 12 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico by Sunday, and as many as 60 vessels were either waiting to get in or out. The Coast Guard - which called it a 'significant spill' - said it expected to deploy more containment booms on Monday, with 24 vessels working to skim the oil. Scroll down for video . Clean up efforts: Vessels work to skim oil off the surface of the water after 168,000 gallons of oil spilled into Galveston Bay, Texas on Saturday . Damage: United States Coast Guardsmen inspect oil washing ashore along Boddeker Road in Galveston as clean up efforts get underway . The cleanup effort comes exactly 25 years after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker slammed into the Bligh Reef in Alaska and spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. Two decades on and the coast remains polluted by the oil. Environmental groups said the Texas spill occurred at an especially sensitive time. The channel in Texas City, about 45 miles southeast of Houston, has important shorebird habitat on both sides, and tens of thousands of wintering birds are still in the area. 'The timing really couldn't be much worse since we're approaching the peak shorebird migration season,' said Richard Gibbons, conservation director of the Houston Audubon Society. He noted that just to the east is the Bolivar Flats Shorebird Sanctuary, which attracts 50,000 to 70,000 shorebirds to shallow mud flats that are perfect foraging habitat. Fewer than 10 oiled birds had been found and recovered for transfer to a wildlife rehabilitation center as of Sunday afternoon, according to the Coast Guard. The Texas General Land Office has also deployed a bird rehabilitation trailer in the area for quick response. 'This is a significant spill,' Capt. Brian Penoyer, commander of the Coast Guard at Houston-Galveston, said. But he said the emptying the remaining oil from the barge on Sunday, a process known as lightering as contents are transferred to other vessels, was an important step and eliminated the risk of additional oil spilling. Victim: A dead oil-covered bird is shown on the Eastern end of Galveston as environmental groups fear the effect on wildlife . Fears: A seagull lands in heavy crude oil washing up on East Beach. The spill occurred near an important shorebird habitat, environmental groups said . Covered: Almost 170,000 gallons of thick, sticky oil were spilled on Saturday. Pictured, the oil covers the shoreline in Galveston . Mess: People photograph oil washing ashore in Galveston on Sunday as crews place a protective boom along the shoreline . More than 380 people - 'and we've ordered more,' Penoyer said - along with a fleet of oil-retrieving skimmers and other vessels were deploying some 60,000 feet of containment booms around environmentally sensitive areas worked to mitigate the damage. Some black tar-like globs, along with a dark line of a sticky, oily substance, could be detected along the shoreline of the Texas City dike, a 5-mile-long jetty that juts into Galveston Bay across from a tip of Galveston Island. 'That is the consistency of what the cargo looks like,' Jim Guidry, executive vice president of Houston-based Kirby Inland Marine Corp., said when the substance was described to him at a news conference. Guidry said the company - the nation's largest inland barge company and owner of the barge that spilled the oil - was taking responsibility for the costs. 'We're very concerned. We're focused on cleaning up,' he said. The barge has been moved to a shipyard and is no longer at the scene of the spill, according to a statement Sunday evening from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office. Two cruise ships were allowed to travel through the incident area ""to minimize inconvenience to the thousands of passengers aboard and limit economic impacts from the spill,"" according to a statement Sunday evening from the Coast Guard. Queue: The Royal Caribbean Navigator of the Seas and the Carnival Magic sit idle with dozens of other ships off the coast of Galveston. At least 33 vessels, including two cruise ships, are waiting to enter the Houston Ship Channel from the Gulf of Mexico . Race against time: Oil containment booms cut across a sand bar covered with birds on Pelican Island. So far about 10 birds have been killed . Fight: Crews place a protective boom along the seashore near Port Bolivar in Port Bolivar as dozens of ships help in the clean up effort on Sunday . Struggle: Workers try to move an oil containment boom from the shore area on the Eastern end of Galveston near the ship channel . Close to shore: Oil containment booms are spread out in Galveston Harbor after the collision spilled nearly 170,000 gallons of thick oil . The channel, part of the Port of . Houston, typically handles as many as 80 vessels daily. But it will . remain closed for a third day Monday, and the Coast Guard said there was . no timetable on when it may reopen. If . the bottleneck of vessels in the Gulf eases in a day or so, there . likely wouldn't be much impact on fuel prices. But a more prolonged . backup could push up prices briefly, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of . energy consultancy Jim Ritterbusch and Associates in Chicago. The . contents of the torn tank, equal to about 4,000 barrels, were lost or . displaced into other vacant areas of the barge. Penoyer said currents, . tides and wind were scattering the spill. 'Containment was never a possibility in this case,' he said. The Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board are still investigating what happened. 'It will take quite a bit of time, given the complexity of the vessels and a very busy waterway,' Penoyer said. Destruction: Marine fuel oil can be seen leaking from a partly submerged barge into the Houston Ship Channel after colliding with a ship on Saturday . Slick: A vessel surrounded by a sheen on the water near the Port of Galveston. The company of the barge carrying the oil is paying for clean up costs .

Heartbreaking: In this April 9, 1989 photo, a local fisherman inspects a dead California gray whale following the spill in Alaska . Also closed was the Texas City dike, a popular fishing spot that goes out into the Gulf for a few miles. Lee Rilat, 58, owns Lee's Bait and Tackle, the last store before the access road to the dike, which was blocked by a police car on a breezy, overcast Sunday. If it weren't for the spill, Rilat's business would be hopping. 'This would be the first spring deal, the first real weekend for fishing,' he said. The spill site is 700 yards offshore from the Texas City dike. A crane and several small boats could be seen at the cleanup site, and dozens of trucks were at a staging area along the beach. The captain of the 585-foot ship, Summer Wind, reported the spill on Saturday afternoon. Six crew members from the tow vessel, which was going from Texas City to Port Bolivar, Texas, were injured, the Coast Guard said.","On Saturday, a barge carrying 900,000 gallons of oil collided with ship in the Houston Ship Channel, spilling nearly 170,000 gallons of thick oil across the busy waterway and closing it down .

In the years that followed, Mike married another woman and in 1971 emigrated to Canada, where they had one daughter and Mike worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Gill, meanwhile, stayed in Grimsby, got married and raised three children of her own, Craig, Lee and Donna. Despite criss-crossing the Atlantic several times - Mike to visit relatives in Grimsby, Gill to see friends in Canada - the former lovers' paths didn't cross again until April last year. By this time Gill had separated from her husband while Mike’s wife Jacqueline had passed away three years earlier. The couple were separated by over 4,000 miles for nearly half a century . But fate was about to take a hand in the shape of a stranger who stopped Mike in the street while he was visiting Grimsby his sister Pamela Borman’s 80th birthday celebrations. It turned out the man was Derek Wood, a fellow Grimsby expat living in Canada whose wife was Gill’s best friend. Expat life: Gill will join Mike in Canada after their wedding and is to bring daughter Donna, 32 . He revealed that Gill had tried to track down Mike while staying with them in Canada the previous year. Phone numbers were exchanged, Mike and Gill arranged to meet up, and their romance was rekindled. 'Gill called me, I phoned her back, we went for a coffee at the Rose And Crown, went for dinner at the Kingsway and the rest, as they say, is history,' revealed Mike. 'I thought it would be nice to reconnect and see what had been going on in her life, but getting married was the last thing on my mind. 'It was amazing to see her again. She is a lovely individual and she really hasn’t changed in all those years.' Gill said: 'It was just lovely meeting up with him and it’s been fantastic ever since. It’s as if all those years have gone away. 'We are both getting on a bit and decided there was no time to waste. He is the man of my dreams. 'I did try to find Mike the year before because my best friend lives just outside Toronto and we were going over to the Rockies. 'I knew somebody in Grimsby who knew him and I knew he lived in Edmonton, but Edmonton is a big place.' Mike and Gill’s wedding will be held at the Oaklands Hall Hotel in Laceby in Lincolnshire on April 20, and following the wedding, Gill will move to Canada, with her daughter Donna, 32, to be with Mike. Grandmother of seven Gill, who works at Morrisons said: 'It is a lovely place. I used to joke to the girls that if I met a nice Canadian I wouldn’t be coming back. I never dreamed that it would happen.'","Gill and Mike dated for 18 months in the mid-1960s .

"By . Emma Innes . Researchers say they have uncovered 'vital clues' in the brains of zebrafish about the way organisms produce the fatty sheath that protects nerve fibres . Exotic fish could hold the key to the development of new treatments for diseases like multiple sclerosis, Scottish scientists claim. A study into the nervous systems of exotic fish could offer insights into the disease which is caused by a breakdown of the vital nerve sheath, myelin. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh say they have uncovered ‘vital clues’ in the brains of zebrafish - tropical fish of the minnow family - about the way that organisms produce the fatty sheath that insulates and protects nerve fibres. They say fresh insights gained from the study could help understanding of how the nervous system works. Myelin is critical for allowing nerve impulses to be transmitted quickly, enabling the human body to carry out a range of everyday functions such as walking, speaking and seeing. The scientists found that individual cells in the brain and central nervous system have only a very short time period in which to generate this protective coating. It is the first time that scientists have been able to quantify the time frame, which is only a matter of hours. They hope that the results of their studies may one day help the treatment of myelin-related conditions such as multiple sclerosis. The researchers are now studying how manipulation of genes and the use of drugs might promote myelin formation in zebrafish. Myelin - which is made by specialised cells called oligodendrocytes - is crucial for good health. When myelin breaks down, and is not repaired properly, it can cause numbness, loss of vision and dizziness. It also leads to the debilitating symptoms of diseases such as MS. MS (pictured) develops when the nerve sheath myelin breaks down. The research could fuel the development of new treatments . Although MS patients have an abundance of oligodendrocytes in their brains, these fail to produce sufficient myelin to bring about repair. The Edinburgh team used zebrafish in the study because they share more than 80 per cent of the genes associated with human diseases. The tiny fish also exhibit responses to drugs that are very similar to those of humans. Young zebrafish are transparent, which allows researchers to look directly into their living nervous system without surgical or physical intervention. Dr David Lyons, of the university’s Centre for Neuroregeneration, said: ‘To enhance myelin repair, we will need to improve either MS patients’ ability to make myelin during the short time in which they have to do this, or find a way to allow them to produce myelin for a longer period of time.’ The study, which is published in Developmental Cell, was carried out in the Centre for Neuroregeneration in collaboration with the MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh.","Zebrafish offer vital insights into the disease that occurs when the nerve sheath, myelin, breaks down .

"By . Jack Doyle . Police Minister Damian Green made the warning as he promised new action to clamp down on offenders from overseas . The number of crimes committed by foreign criminals is ‘sizeable and increasing’, a minister warned yesterday. Police Minister Damian Green made the warning as he promised new action to clamp down on offenders from overseas. He pointed to figures showing more than 74,000 foreign national offenders were arrested in London in a single year. David Cameron has personally pledged to deport more foreign criminals from Britain. But human rights laws, foreign countries’ refusal to accept their own nationals and delays in getting travel documents mean many dangerous offenders are allowed to stay in the country. In London, the Metropolitan Police’s Operation Nexus has seen immigration officials based in police stations so swift action can be taken when foreign criminals are arrest. The operation has seen more than 1,000 foreign offenders deported in the past 18 months. But Mr Green said the scale of offending by foreign nationals outside the capital was ‘less well understood’. In a speech to Police and Crime Commissioners in London on Tuesday, Mr Green said: ‘The level of crime in England and Wales committed by foreign nationals is sizeable and increasing. ‘In 2011/12 the Metropolitan Police arrested over 74,000 foreign national offenders. ‘The scale of the challenge is less well understood outside London. But we are building that evidence for the rest of the country and will share it as soon as we can to help you deal with the problem more effectively.’ He added: ‘This is not about picking on people because they are not from the UK. ‘Foreign national offenders are first and foremost criminals. The fact that they are not UK nationals provides us with other options for dealing with them.’ Joland Giwa, whose street name is Dexter, is a notorious gangster from Croydon, south London, who was behind bars for a string of street robberies . In coming months, the Met scheme is set to be extended across the country in an effort to throw out more foreign criminals. Officials will identify and process foreign suspects as soon as they are arrested, checking whether they are wanted abroad or are here illegally. Computer records of suspected serious offenders will be marked with a ‘red flag’ to prevent them applying for British nationality while they go through the courts. An Immigration Bill currently before Parliament will reduce the ability of foreign criminals to use Article 8 of the Human Rights Act - the right to a private and family life - to stay in Britain. Criminals could also be deported first and forced to conduct their appeals from abroad. Last week it emerged that a violent street gang ‘general’ who poses a serious threat to the public has been let out on bail, because immigration officials cannot work out where he is from. Joland Giwa, whose street name is Dexter, is a notorious gangster from Croydon, south London, who was behind bars for a string of street robberies. He was kept inside for four years after serving his sentence as efforts were made to deport him. But officials were unable to get him a passport because they couldn’t be sure where he was from. He was released on a tag in December told to live in South Wales and to stay away from London. Figures show up to one in four organised criminals targeting Britain is from overseas. There are around 11,000 foreign offenders in the country’s prison system - costing taxpayers more than £300million a year. The total number deported has fallen by 14 per cent in four years. Some 5,528 were removed in the final quarter of 2009, compared to 4,730 between April and June last year. In 2012, the Prime Minister said: ‘When people are sent to prison we should do everything to make sure that if they’re foreign, they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence. ‘It is not good enough, the situation we have in Britain today.’ No one from the Polish Embassy was available for comment last night.’","Police Minister Damian Green made the warning as he promised new action to clamp down on offenders from overseas .

"By . Paul Sims . A former police detective battered his partner senseless with a baseball bat in front of their two young children after a petty row over a missing baby changing bag. Peter Foster, 36, bludgeoned police constable Heather Cooper and then stabbed her in the throat just weeks after she had given birth. He then drove her body to a wood and buried the 33-year-old in a shallow grave before sending a series of texts from her mobile phone to try to create an alibi. Scroll down for video . Change of plea: Former detective Peter Foster (left) was today jailed for life for killing Detective Constable Heather Cooper (right), who was stabbed before her body was dumped in West Sussex woodland last year . Killer: Foster is led away from Lewes Crown Court after today's sentencing . When he was eventually arrested for . the murder – described by a judge as ‘wicked, savage and senseless’ – . Foster led officers to her body but insisted he had acted in . self-defence. But after an agonising eight-month wait for her family, his flimsy explanation was yesterday exposed as pure fiction. The former detective constable, who . left the Surrey force in disgrace after receiving a suspended jail . sentence for drink-driving in 2010, changed his plea to guilty as a . result. Together in grief: Miss Cooper's parents James and Caroline stand with her children Joshua and Isabelle at her funeral in York last November . Tragic: Miss Cooper's son Joshua (centre) arrives for the funeral of his mother with his maternal grandparents . Victim: Miss Cooper grew up in York and joined Surrey Police in 2003 . Foster was jailed for life and ordered . to serve at least 17 years by Judge Richard Brown at Lewes Crown Court . who described him as an ‘extremely dangerous individual’. In a victim impact statement Miss . Cooper’s parents, James and Caroline Cooper, said the murder had an . unimaginable impact on the two children who witnessed the attack. Joshua, who is now three, and Isabel, . who was only three months old at the time, had been handed a life . sentence by the loss of their devoted mother, they said. On the day of the murder Joshua, a . ‘normally playful’ little boy, was asked where his mother was. Subdued . and quiet he simply replied: ‘Sleeping.’ ‘Joshua was present when his mother . was brutally murdered. We cannot envisage what he is experiencing and . what is going on in the mind of this three-year-old,’ they said. The court was told how the couple had . been to a christening on October 16 when an argument started about a . missing baby changing bag. They sat with their backs to each . other in the church and left early without attending the reception, . Benjamin Aina QC, prosecuting, said. The row continued when the couple returned to their £700,000 home in Haslemere, Surrey. Foster, who was known to have a ‘short . fuse’, later claimed Miss Cooper, an ‘exceptional’ officer with Surrey . Police, swiped at him with a knife while he was carrying Isabel. Murder scene: Miss Cooper was killed at the couple's home (pictured) while she was on maternity leave with her second child, who was born just weeks prior to her death . Search: Police scour Blackdown Woods for clues after finding the body of DC Cooper last year . He told police that, in self-defence, . he hit her once with a baseball bat. She then left the room and he later . found her with a knife through her throat. In reality, Miss Cooper had been hit . more than ten times with the bat, whilst the stabbing had happened after . she was unconscious, post-mortem results revealed. Foster had, in fact, taken time to . clean up the blood-soaked crime scene and taken Miss Cooper’s body to . Blackdown Woods, near Lurgashall, West Sussex, where he covered it with . bracken. Investigation: A post-mortem examination confirmed death was caused by blunt force trauma to the head and a stab wound to the throat . He also made several trips to the home . of his grandmother, Marguerite Halkins, where he had left his two . children. Foster later contacted Miss Cooper’s mother by text, . pretending to be her daughter and reassuring her all was well. He then told his cousin, David Foster, . some of the details about what happened and he alerted police. When . officers arrived at Miss Halkins’ home, Foster told them: ‘You should . arrest me’. When they asked him what for, he replied: ‘Murder’. Philippa McAtasney QC, mitigating, . said Foster had expressed ‘genuine remorse’. ‘He knows he has ruined all . of their lives and knows that nothing he can say can undo the pain and . the hurt that everyone feels,’ she said. The home Miss Cooper shared with Foster in Haslemere is just four miles away from the spot in Blackdown Woods where her body was found . She said he left the police after a . nine-year career after he was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, . suspended for a year, for drink-driving and danger- ous driving. Miss Cooper, who grew up in York, . joined Surrey Police in 2003 and worked in the Public Protection . Investigation Unit based at Guildford. During her career she received several . letters of praise from senior officers for her work on various crimes . and in 2009 was given a commendation by the force for her . ‘professionalism, dedication and commitment’.

MP: George Galloway is embroiled in a fresh row for calling a Twitter user a 'window-licker' George Galloway is being paid almost £80,000 a year by a television station linked to Syria and Iran, it emerged yesterday. The Respect Party MP presents a . fortnightly programme on the Lebanon-based Al Mayadeen – a rival to Al . Jazeera. He earns £3,000 per episode. The recently launched station has . refused to reveal the identity of its financial backers. One industry . figure said it was supported by Iran and a cousin of Syrian president . Bashar Al-Assad, but the channel denied this, claiming it is ‘completely . independent’ and funded by Arab businessmen. The Times newspaper has reported that . the channel’s head of news is married to a former adviser to Assad, and . that its general manager was previously head of Al-Manar, the . broadcaster affiliated to Hezbollah. Mr Galloway, MP for Bradford West, . insisted Al Mayadeen is ‘privately owned’, adding: ‘All I can say about . [the owners] is ... they won’t be as disreputable as the owners of The . Times.’ The anti-war politician has used his . programme, A Free Word, to rail against the West’s support for the . uprising in Syria. He has previously described Assad as ‘the last . bastion of Arab dignity’. In a separate controversy, Mr . Galloway is facing calls for his resignation after insulting a Twitter . user with a pejorative term for a disabled person days before the start . of the Paralympics. He angered users on the social networking site after using the . derogatory term 'window-licker' on his page. He posted the offensive comment in a spat with a fan of Glaswegian football club Rangers, as he taunted the supoprter. The MP posted the comment on Sunday when he tweeted to @Hawfa, whose name on the site is Craig Dickson,: 'you badly need medical help son. Will decent Rangers fans please substitute this windae-licker … ' The tweet which was visible to 90,000 of his followers on the social networking site drew criticism from other users.

You're a . disaster.' 'I know people who've lost their job for calling disabled people window lickers ur a dam disgrace using that phrase' wrote @dukesy12. As @Hawfa's tweets are private, it was unclear what conversation the insult stemmed from, and his response. The . term was voted third most offensive that could be used relating to . disability in a poll run for the BBC's Ouch! disability talk show in . 2003. Dan Scorer, senior campaigns and policy manager at the learning disability charity Mencap told the Guardian: 'We are appalled that George Galloway, a member of parliament, has used this unacceptable term of abuse, which is deeply offensive to disabled people. Hate crime and bullying are a daily reality for many disabled people and the use of language like this only furthers hostility and violence. We call on him to apologise immediately.' Last week Galloway was attacked by the leader of his own party over a controversial claim that a rape allegation against WikiLeaks campaigner Julian Assange amounted to no more than bad ‘sexual etiquette’. Last week Galloway said the rape allegation against WikiLeaks campaigner Julian Assange amounted to no more than bad 'sexual etiquette' Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob branded Mr Galloway’s comments as ‘deeply disappointing and wrong’ as the Bradford West MP faced growing criticism of his remarks. The woman at the centre of the allegation, who is a WikiLeaks supporter, told police she had consensual sex with Assange in August 2010 but woke the following morning to find he was having sex with her again, without her consent and without using a condom. Mr Galloway said this could not be rape, as the pair had had sex and were ‘already in the sex game’. He later defended his comments, saying he did not believe the accusations against Assange would have led to rape prosecution in Britain. He said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of a set-up. What occurred is not rape as most people understand it.’ Mr Galloway faced a barrage of criticism after rape charities reacted with fury to his comments. The Respect candidate in the upcoming Manchester Central by-election, Kate Hudson, echoed the criticism from her leader, writing on Twitter: ‘I am with you Salma.’ Businessman Lord Sugar wrote on the social networking site: ‘Galloway entitled to speak mind, like all off us. He has no factual detail of the alleged crime committed by Assange, so should shut his trap.’ He was recently sacked as a columnist on the Scottish political magazine Holyrood. In 2008, two BBC radio presenters were suspended after using the term 'window licker' during a football phone-in show at BBC Southern Counties. The action was taken after Ian Hart told a . football fan to 'go and lick a window' in a row about Brighton and Hove . Albion manager Micky Adams. His comment was followed by Andrew Hawes urging 'any window lickers out there' to call the show. Mr Hart, 44, later said he apologised 'unreservedly' for his comments. 'In that split second I didn't realise the severity of what I was saying,' he said. 'I now know it was grossly inappropriate.'","Respect MP presents show on the Lebanon-based Al Mayadeen for £3000 per episode .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Life threatening: Moira Japp, above, was left with deep lacerations after colliding with the door while wearing just a bikini. The glass in the French window was not toughened or reinforced . A compensation payout to a holidaymaker who suffered life-threatening injuries after walking into a glass door in her bikini is threatening to leave the UK travel industry in chaos, top judges have heard. Lawyers have warned that an award to Moira Japp, who was hurt during her stay at an exclusive Caribbean hotel, will ‘create great difficulties for the tourist industry’ by expecting ‘far-flung exotic places’ to comply with British health and safety standards. Mrs Japp had been relaxing on her balcony at the Crystal Cove Hotel in Barbados when she heard a phone ring inside, and accidentally walked into the closed French windows which led into her room. The glass shattered and she suffered deep lacerations all over her body which, according to her lawyers, could have been life-threatening. In October last year Mrs Japp, 53, from Worthing, West Sussex, sued trip organisers Virgin Holidays Limited and was awarded £24,000 damages. However the company are now asking the Appeal Court to overturn that decision. They have pointed out that if the courts hold British travel companies responsible for ensuring tough UK safety rules are upheld around the world, then it will make life more difficult for the industry – a problem which could end up raising prices for other holidaymakers. Sarah Prager, representing Virgin Holidays, confirmed in court that the accident had left Mrs Japp with ‘multiple lacerations’. She told judges: ‘On June 24 2008, Mrs Japp booked a package holiday on Barbados with Virgin Holidays. ‘Throughout the holiday, Mrs Japp was to stay in the Crystal Cove Hotel in Appleby, St James. ‘At approximately 5pm on September 3, she returned to her hotel room and went out on to the balcony to read a book, closing the patio doors as she did so. ‘Some short time later, the telephone in her room rang and she got up and walked quickly into the closed doors. The doors shattered, causing multiple lacerations. They were constructed using glass a quarter of an inch thick. It was neither toughened nor safety glass.’ She added: ‘Mrs Japp said the hotelier ought to have ensured the glass was of such thickness that it did not shatter.’ But Miss Prager then went on to warn . the judges about the potential dangers of expecting other countries to . live up to English standards of health and safety. Paradise: Crystal Cove is billed as an exclusive holiday resort, but Virgin were held liable for the sub standard levels of health and safety on the site . She said: ‘Exporting English standards would give rise to lack of clarity – some nations are more risk averse than others. ‘If travel agents are told that . facilities have to comply with English notions of reasonableness, that . is going to create great difficulties for the English tourist industry . in general.’ However Andrew Spencer, representing Mrs Japp, argued that . Virgin Holidays had rightly been held liable. He said: ‘When people book a package holiday, they are entitled to expect that the facilities are not unsafe.’ Lord Justice Lewison, sitting with . Lords Justice Richards and Tomlinson, has said he will deliver the . court’s decision at a later date.

"By . Peter Campbell, City Correspondent . Facebook has been accused of creating ‘tomorrow’s generation of problem gamblers’ by rolling out real money casino games. Under a lucrative deal with online gaming company 888, the social networking giant will offer Las Vegas-style slot machines and games such as roulette and blackjack. The move heralds a major expansion of its gambling sites. Casino games: Facebook has been accused of creating the next generation of gamblers through its real money games (file picture) Campaigners criticised Facebook's first gambling app launch amid concerns that young people would be exposed . Gamers will be able to place up to £500 on bets using a credit or debit card with promises of jackpots worth tens of thousands of pounds. These will only be available in the UK, where gaming laws are more relaxed than in the US. Both Facebook and 888 insist they have safeguards to prevent minors from accessing the games. These include checking the credit card details used against both their Facebook profile and the electoral register. But there is nothing to stop children logging on to parents’ accounts and using card details already stored on the family computer. Already, Facebook users as young as 13 can use virtual slot machines on the website to win ‘credits’ – which have no monetary value. But as soon as they turn 18, millions of children who use the social networking site will be bombarded with adverts for real money gambling games. Facebook has three million UK users aged between 13 and 17. But a further one million are thought to be under 13 and pretending to be older. Any of these could already be playing the ‘free’ slot and bingo games – which critics say form gambling habits because they simulate the thrill of hitting the jackpot. More than a million people are already signed up to play 888’s free bingo game Bingo Island – although not all of these are UK based. They have to pay for online credits to play, but cannot win any real money back. Concern: Critics worry users, including children using parents credit card details, will get hooked on the casino-style games . Excited: The chief operating company of 888 said there is a 'significant audience' for the games and under 18s would be prevented from seeing them . Yesterday 888 launched its first real . money bingo application, with promises to roll out casino games. Critics . fear many will be attracted to the new games to try to win money back, . after experiencing the unrealistic odds offered on the free versions. ‘You . win virtually every time you play one of the free games,’ said Mark . Griffiths, professor of gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University. ‘Research has shown again and again . that one of the biggest factors in developing problem gambling is . playing free games online first. These children and teenagers today are . the problem gamblers of tomorrow.’ He . warned the deal with 888 could cause ‘the floodgates to open’ as . gambling companies dive into the social media frenzy to make money. It . is thought Facebook will take a 30 per cent cut of all bets placed. In August, Facebook launched its first ‘real money’ gambling game with Bingo Friendzy, which offers bingo and slot machines. But the deal, done with Gamesys Group, is relatively small compared with the potential influx of gambling giants who could queue up to join Facebook if the venture proves to be profitable. Itai Frieberger, chief operating officer of 888, said: ‘Our Facebook play for fun offerings have found a significant audience, and we are very excited by the opportunity real money gaming on Facebook provides.’ He said the company would prevent users who are under 18 on Facebook from even seeing the games. A spokesman for Facebook said Bingo Friendzy players are subject to ‘strict account acceptance controls verifying their identity, and that they are over 18 and located in the UK.’ Gambling will not be promoted to Facebook members registered as under 18, it added.","Critics say the deal with gaming group 888 will create 'tomorrow's generation of problem gamblers'

"By . Emma Thomas . Sexual predator: Neville Williams, 56, broke into his victim¿s home and raped her. Detectives tracked him down years later and he has been jailed . A man who broke into a teenage mother's home and raped her has been jailed for ten years. Neville Williams, 56, broke into his victim’s home and boasted it was his birthday as he brutally raped her. After her ordeal, which happened on October 1, 1999 - Williams’ 42nd birthday - he threatened to return and rape the young mum again if she called police. The terrified victim, aged 19 at the time, fled her home in Birmingham and resettled in another part of the country to escape the memory of what happened. But after 12 years of silence she finally went to police in November 2011 and officers launched a search for her attacker. Specialist teams were able to track Williams after his victim remembered he called himself by his nickname ‘Crunch’. After his arrest in June last year unemployed Williams denied the attack and went on trial earlier this year. But a jury found him guilty after hearing evidence from a friend and the woman’s GP about a change in her personality following the attack. At Birmingham Crown Court, Neville, from Smiths Wood, Solihull, West Midlands, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for life and subjected to a restraining order to protect his victim. Speaking after the verdict, she said: 'I’m stuck for words. I’m so pleased. I had to double check this morning I wasn’t dreaming. 'Knowing he’s locked away and other girls are safe is the best thing ever. 'I can’t find the right words to express how I feel.' Sentenced: At Birmingham Crown Court, Neville, from Solihull, West Midlands, was jailed for 10 years . Detective Chief Inspector Dean Young said West Midlands Police had received reports other woman had been raped by Neville and urged any victims to come forward. He said: 'I commend the woman for her courage. She is a role model for countless other women who have been assaulted over the years and who have never felt able to tell police officers their story. 'As well as helping secure a lengthy jail term for Williams preventing him from harming others, she will undoubtedly be a source of strength and inspiration for people who are in a situation similar to hers.' Mr Young also appealed for any other victims to come forward. 'When investigating the assault on this woman, witnesses suggested that other woman had been attacked by Williams but that they had not reported these to police. 'I would appeal directly to anyone who has been assaulted but felt unable to tell us at the time to contact us. 'Your secret will have been a heavy one to bear for all this time. Now is the time to seek help.'","Neville Williams broke into victim’s home and boasted it was his birthday .

"By . Associated Press . New York State Troopers are being given tall, unmarked SUVs to peer down at drivers' hands - to catch people texting while driving. New York has given state police 32 of the SUVs, part of one of the nation's most aggressive attacks on texting while driving that also includes steeper penalties and dozens of highway 'Texting Zones', where motorists can pull over to use their devices. New York is among 41 states that ban text messaging for all drivers and is among only 12 that prohibit using hand-held cellphones. New York State Trooper Clayton Howell checks a driver's license after making a traffic stop for distracted driving in Greenburgh, NY . Should using hand-held cellphones while driving be banned in ALL states? The state this year stiffened penalties for motorists caught using hand-held devices to talk or text, increasing penalty points on the driving record from three to five, along with tickets that carry fines of up to $200. With the tough new penalties came tougher enforcement. In a two-month crackdown this summer, troopers handed out 5,553 tickets for texting while driving, compared to 924 in the same period last year. In New York's recent push, 91 existing rest areas and turnoffs on the state Thruway and other highways have been rebranded 'Texting Zones,' some advertised with blue signs declaring 'It can wait. Text stop 5 miles.' 'To our knowledge, New York is the first,' Jonathan Adkins, deputy executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, said of the texting turnoffs. 'It's an intriguing approach and one that we think will pay dividends and be duplicated in other states.' The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that at any moment during daylight hours, 660,000 drivers in the United States are texting, using cellphones or otherwise manipulating electronic devices. It says more than 3,300 people were killed and 421,000 injured in crashes caused by distracted driving last year. New York State Trooper Clayton Howell checks a screen that displays driving records inside his patrol vehicle in Hawthorne, NY . Major Michael Kopy, commander of the state police troop patrolling the corridor between New York City and Albany, quoted a Virginia Tech study that found texting while driving increased the chance of a collision by 23 times and took eyes off the road for five seconds — more than the length of a football field at highway speed. Kopy worries that as teens get their driver's licenses, texting on the road will become more prevalent. 'More people are coming of driving age who have had these hand-held devices for many years, and now as they start to drive, they're putting the two together, texting and driving, when they shouldn't.' Howell's SUV, called a CITE vehicle for Concealed Identity Traffic Enforcement, is designed to catch just such drivers. Mousy gray in color, it swoops in undetected when Howell suspects a violation. 'You can see how oblivious they are to this vehicle,' Howell said as a woman holding a phone paid him no mind. 'I'm right next to them, and they have no idea.' The driver, a doctor, said she'd been running late and was on the phone to her office. It didn't qualify as an emergency under the rules, but she got off with a warning. 'Look at that,' Trooper Clayton Howell says, pulling alongside a black BMW while patrolling the highways north of New York City. 'This guy's looking down. I can see his thumb on the phone. I think we got him.' After a quick wail of the siren and a flash of the tucked-away flashers, an accountant from the suburbs is pulled over and politely given a ticket. The accountant who was ticketed, Chris Pecchia, of Montrose, told Howell he hadn't been texting but rather was looking at a map displayed on his phone. He was cited anyway, for driving while using a portable electronic device. 'His story's believable, but even a GPS has to be hands-free,' Howell said. Pecchia said afterward: 'I can't look at a map? What's the difference between looking at a paper map and looking at a map on the phone?' Still, he said, he understood why the trooper pulled him over. He said he would never text while driving and has forbidden his 17-year-old daughter from doing so. Howell pulled over a registered nurse because she had earbuds in both ears. Only one earbud is permitted while driving. She got off with a warning after explaining she was listening to her GPS's turn-by-turn directions. 'I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt,' Howell said. 'It's my philosophy to educate, and when you pull somebody over and give them a warning, that's a pretty good education.'","Texting while driving increases the chance of a collision by 23 times .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The ancient Martian crater where the Curiosity rover landed looks strikingly similar to the Mojave Desert in California with its looming mountains and hanging haze, scientists said on Wednesday. 'The first impression that you get is how Earth-like this seems looking at that landscape,' said chief scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology. Overnight, the car-size rover poked its head out for the first time since settling in Gale Crater, peered around and returned a black-and-white self-portrait and panorama. Scroll down for video . Earth-like landscape: This image released by NASA and taken by cameras aboard the Curiosity rover shows the Martian horizon scientists say resembles the Mojave Desert . It provided the best view so far of its destination since touching down Sunday night after nailing an intricate landing onto the surface of the Red Planet. During the last few seconds, a rocket-powered spacecraft hovered as cables lowered Curiosity to the ground. In the latest photos, Curiosity looked out toward the northern horizon. Nearby were scour marks in the surface blasted by thrusters, which kicked up a swirl of dust. There were concerns that Curiosity got dusty, but scientists said that was not the case. This NASA image shows a portion of the first 360-degree panoramic view from NASA's Curiosity rover, taken with the Navigation cameras . 'We do see a thin coating of dust, but nothing too bad,' said Justin Maki, imaging scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the $2.5 billion mission. Scientists were giddy about the scour marks because they exposed bedrock below - information that should help them better understand the landing site. Since landing, Curiosity has zipped home a stream of low-resolution pictures taken by tiny cameras under the chassis and a camera at the end of its robotic arm, which remained stowed. It also sent back a low-quality video showing the last 2 1/2 minutes of its descent. The rover successfully raised its mast packed with high-resolution and navigation cameras. Comparing: The Mojave Desert stretches throughout southeastern and central California as well as southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona, in the United States . This NASA image shows a Picasso-like self portrait of NASA's Curiosity rover taken by its Navigation cameras, located on the now-upright mast . With the mast up, it can begin its photographic days in force, including taking a 360-degree color view of its surroundings as early as Thursday. Grotzinger said he was struck by the Martian landscape, which appeared diverse. There seemed to be harder material underneath the gravelly surface, he said. 'It kind of makes you feel at home,' he said. 'We're looking at a place that feels really comfortable.' Mars, of course, is very different from Earth. It's a frigid desert constantly bombarded by radiation. There are geological signs that it was a warmer and wetter place once upon a time. One of the mission's goals is to figure out how Mars transformed. From above: Curiosity is seen photographed here by the Mars Descent Imager instrument or MARDI, showing the 15-foot (4.5-meter) diameter heat shield when it was about 50 feet (16 meters) from the spacecraft . A view through a Hazard-Avoidance camera on . NASA's Curiosity rover before and after the clear dust cover was . removed. Both images were taken by a camera at the front of the rover. After sailing 352 million miles and eight months, Curiosity parked its six wheels near the Martian equator, where it will spend the next two years poking into rocks and soil in search of the chemical ingredients of life. Nasa has also revealed amazing new . images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which  captured the . Curiosity rover and the components that helped it survive its . seven-minute ordeal from space to its present location in Mars' Gale . Crater. 'This latest image is another . demonstration of the invaluable assistance the Mars Reconnaissance . Orbiter team, and its sister team with the Mars Odyssey orbiter, have . provided the Curiosity rover during our early days on the Red Planet,' said Mike Watkins, mission manager for the Mars Science Laboratory . mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 'The . image not only satisfies our curiosity, it can provide important . information on how these vital components performed during entry, . descent and landing, and exactly locate the rover's touchdown site . within Gale Crater.' In the image (below) the Curiosity rover is in the center of the image. This amazing image from the HiRise camera shows the Curiosity lander on Mars along with the components of its landing system . To . the right, approximately 4,900 feet (1,500 meters) away, lies the heat . shield, which protected the rover from 3,800-degree-Fahrenheit (about . 2,100 degrees Celsius) temperatures encountered during its fiery . descent.

The back shell remains connected to the chute via 80 suspension lines that are 165 feet (50 meters) long. To . the upper-left, approximately 2,100 feet (650 meters) away from the . rover, is a discoloration of the Mars surface consistent with what would . have resulted when the rocket-powered Sky Crane impacted the surface.

'This is the first of what I imagine will be many portraits HiRISE will . be taking of Curiosity on the surface of Mars,"" said Sarah Milkovich, . HiRISE investigation scientist at JPL. 'The image was taken Monday at . about 10:30 p.m. Pacific when MRO was at an altitude of about 186 miles . (300 kilometers), and we are getting resolution on the surface down to . 1.3 feet (39 centimeters) per pixel.' It is the most expensive and ambitious mission yet to Mars. Its ultimate destination is a mountain towering from the center of the crater floor. Preliminary estimates indicate Curiosity landed four miles away from the base of Mount Sharp, thought to contain intriguing signs of past water - a starting point to learning whether microbial life could exist. Before the one-ton, nuclear-powered Curiosity can start roving, it has to undergo several weeks of tedious but essential health checks. Since it was too heavy to land using traditional air bags, it used a heat shield, parachute, rockets and cables. An orbiting spacecraft spotted the discarded spacecraft hardware, including the ballast weights that were shed soon after entry into the atmosphere.",The clearest image ever taken of the surface of Mars reveals an Earth-like desert-scape that has been compared to the Mojave in California .
"By . Ted Thornhill . Frustrated: President Barack Obama pauses while speaking about the budget and the partial government shutdown . Taliban has mocked the US shutdown, telling politicians that they are ‘sucking the blood of their own people’. The comment was made by the Islamist militants, who are embroiled in a conflict with troops from the US and its allies in Afghanistan, in a statement issued on Wednesday. It described American leaders as ‘selfish and empty-headed for taking money from their people and ‘lavishly spending the same money in shedding the blood of the innocent and oppressed people’. The statement, according to AFP, said: ‘The American people should realise that their politicians play with their destinies as well as the destinies of other oppressed nations for the sake of their personal vested interests.’ It added: ‘Instead of sucking the blood of their own people, this money should be utilised for the sake of peace.’ The conflict in Afghanistan has claimed the lives of 444 UK servicemen and women and 2,270 US troops. There was anger on Tuesday over remarks made by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who said that Britain and the US had done little more than cause ‘suffering, loss of life and no gains’. In an interview to mark six months before he leaves office, he said: ‘The entire Nato exercise was one that caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life and no gains because the country is not secure.’ Mocking: The Taliban has decreed that US politicians are sucking the blood of their own people . Losses: The war in Afghanistan has resulted in thousands of deaths for Nato forces . He accused Nato of focusing on Afghan villages rather than Taliban and Al Qaeda ‘sanctuaries and training grounds’ in Pakistan and also attacked air strikes as a ‘violation’ of sovereignty. Karzai was installed in 2001 after allies drove the Taliban from power and he agreed that they should continue fighting. In the interview he also accused NATO on . focusing their war against terrorism on Afghan villages instead of . Taliban and al-Qaeda bases in neighbouring Pakistan. No entry: A sign at the entrance of the World War Veterans Park in New York, which the shutdown has closed . Following his attack on the organisation, NATO’s former Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, hit back at Karzai's critique, calling it 'unfair' to the soldiers who have lost their lives to protect a country not their own. The shutdown, meanwhile, has pushed . hundreds of thousands of workers off the job, closed national parks and . museums and stopped an array of government services. President Barack Obama and John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, are pressuring each other to open the way for votes to end the government shutdown and raise the federal debt limit. The shutdown has been forced by Republicans who oppose the Affordable Care Act – or Obamacare – a healthcare reform plan that recently became law. They want to see cuts made to it, so are refusing to vote on the federal debt limit being extended until they can negotiate changes. The debit limit, currently at $16.94tn, is set every year by a normally routine temporary spending bill, but this year Republicans are using it as leverage. Without having approval from both sides on what it can borrow, the Government has had to halt payments to various institutions and services it funds and, of course, lots of employees. Barack Obama has warned that if the government's borrowing authority is not extended by October 17, the United States will not be able to pay its bills.","The militants described American leaders as 'selfish and empty-headed'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Cleg is being urged by Lib Dems to woo eastern European immigrants to avoid electoral wipe out in elections in May. Issan Ghazni, a candidate to become an MEP in the East Midlands, claimed securing the support of people from eastern European could make the difference between the party winning or losing. The chairman of Ethnic Minority Liberal Democrats also warned many people from overseas did not though they had a vote. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is warned by one of his own candidates that winning support from eastern Europeans could be key to electoral success in May . The Lib Dems risk facing wipeout on May 22 when voters take part in elections to the European Parliament. Ukip leader Nigel Farage – who has been outspoken in his criticism of immigration from eastern European - has predicted his party will win the most votes, triggering a ‘political earthquake’. But Mr Ghazni claims the party could avoid annihilation by winning over people from countries like Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and Latvia. He said: ‘Doomsday predictions in the media that Liberal Democrats are set to lose all our MEPs to UKIP are wide of the mark. ‘The closer we get to the Euro elections in May the greater the opportunity for us to win support from the substantial minority of voters who are pro-Europe.’ EU citizens can vote in European and local elections in the UK, elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies and some referendums but are not able to vote in UK Parliamentary general elections. People from the following countries living in the UK can vote on May 22: . Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. He admitted that the threat of Ukip is a ‘substantial one’ and pressure from Mr Farage means the Lib Dems ‘need to get smarter’. Mr Ghazni said he recently visited ‘five Eastern European coffee shops’ in the town of Boston in the East Midlands to talk with migrant workers. ‘As soon as they heard the Lib Dems’ pro-Europe message of supporting the free movement of goods and labour they were eager to vote for us,’ he wrote for LibDemVoice. ‘People in the cafes told me they were fearful of the anti-immigration rhetoric of UKIP and the Tory Right, and many would enthusiastically support the Lib Dems if only we made contact with them. We must, for they could hold the key to fending off UKIP and make the difference between keeping or losing our MEPs. ‘Eastern Europeans will become more established in future decades. Securing their support today, at a time when they are repelled by the anti-immigration climate, will serve us well in future elections. And it may just take us over the winning post in May.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage predicts he will . trigger a political 'earthquake' by topping the Euro elections, while . David Cameron is under pressure from Eurosceptics in the Tory party see . off the threat of Ukip . A YouGov opinion poll last month Labour on course to come first, with Ukip in second followed by the Conservatives. Labour was on 32 per cent and Ukip on 26 per cent, with the Tories trailing on 23 per cent and Liberal Democrats a distant fourth on 9 per cent. If the findings were repeated on May 22 with a uniform swing, they would see Conservative representation at the European Parliament slashed by 11 to 15 MEPs. The Conservatives are on course to come third in the elections to the European Parliament in May, behind Labour and Ukip. YouGov interviewed 1,893 adults for The Sun on January 14 and 15 . Labour would have 28 (up 15), Ukip 23 (up 10), and the Lib Dems' 11 MEPs would be completely wiped out. A Lib Dem spokesman rejected the idea the party would be wiped out, and insisted Mr Ghazni’s ideas were not party policy. ‘It is a suggestion from a single candidate. Our campaign will be based on making the case that we are the only party prepared to unambiguously make the case for Britain in Europe. ‘We hope to appeal to the many people across the UK who believe Britain is better off in the European Union. ‘Europe needs reform but being in Europe means we have a stronger economy with millions of British jobs protected, we can catch criminals who cross our borders and work with our European neighbours to tackle climate change.’","Nick Clegg under pressure from candidates to target EU citizens in the UK .

"By . James Chapman . British firms who do not export to the EU should be freed from the most burdensome Brussels regulations, hundreds of business leaders will say today. Business for Britain, a Eurosceptic campaign group representing 800 business leaders, will propose that only the five per cent of UK companies who trade with the Continent should be subject to the rules of the single market. It says reform should form a centrepiece of Britain’s demands for a looser relationship with the EU in a renegotiation of membership promised by David Cameron ahead of an in/out referendum if the Conservatives win the next election. Business for Britain will propose only five per cent of UK companies who deal with Europe should be subject to rules of the single market (library image) Though it is far from clear that other EU member states would countenance such an opt-out, the plan is winning considerable support among Eurosceptic Tories, including former Europe minister David Davis and former Cabinet minister John Redwood. Under the so-called ‘British Option’, EU laws would continue to augment UK business law, but Parliament would approve a list of regulations that would not apply to companies and organisations that do not trade with the single market. The campaign group foresees the UK remaining a member of a reformed EU, ensuring that all companies that export to the EU retain full access to the single marker. However, the majority of British firms would be freed from regulation estimated to cost them around £7.5 billion a year. They include the working time directive, limiting working hours, the temporary agency work directive, giving the same rights to temps as permanent staff, and the EU climate change and energy package. The move would ‘hugely benefit’ jobs in the UK and could be replicated across the EU should other member states wish to compete more effectively, today’s report says. The majority of British firms would be freed from regulation - thought to cost around £7.5billion a year . Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, said: ‘It is clear from our survey of the business community that they want a forward-looking relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics. ‘Business leaders want access to the single market for the five per cent of firms that trade with the EU, but they also want to make Britain more competitive in the global race and to ensure that we are better able to trade with the high-growth areas of the world.’ ‘Many different, often complex ideas have been advanced to improve or refine the single market in the EU, but none have yet tackled the huge regulatory and financial burden it places on the 95 per cent of companies that don’t even export to the Continent. ‘By excluding these firms and organisations that don’t need access to the single market from the most burdensome aspects of EU regulation, the Government would, at a stroke, better position Britain.’ Former Europe minister David Davis is thought to be one of many behind the proposals . Mr Davis, a former Europe minister, said: ‘This is a very good proposal. I’d vote to leave the EU if we get no change. If we achieve this, it would make me change my mind. ‘If the people who run Europe want to hold it together, they should be giving this very serious consideration. It won’t just appeal to the majority of British businesses who don’t access the single market, but big majorities of businesses in most successful countries across the EU.’ Former Conservative Cabinet minister Mr Redwood said: ‘I think this is a brilliant idea. It would solve overnight the problem of small businesses and European regulation. We can’t have a situation where the tail wags the dog.’ Dominic Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘This win-win proposal would be a major boost to Britain’s small businesses and rising global exports, whilst recognising the reality that EU rules cover EU trade. The government should look closely at the idea. We will need creative thinking like this, if we are to navigate a path to a successful renegotiation of UK membership of the EU.’ But Adam Nathan, of the pro-EU campaign group British Influence, said: ‘These proposals would amount to a bureaucratic nightmare. While there is always scope for reducing the regulatory burden for businesses, these proposals would scupper the single market, which is based on the principle that anything legitimately put on the market in one member state may be put on the market across the whole EU. ‘This would be a disaster for our EU exports which account for 14 per cent of our GDP and small businesses looking to expand through exporting into Europe would face the double burden of complying with both UK and EU regulations.’ TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘This is just another attempt to take away people’s rights to paid holiday leave, health and safety at work, fairness and equality. It would take away basic employment rights – as well as protections like food safety and consumer rights – from everyone except the chosen few in Britain’s export industries. ‘It would create a two-tier economy with reams of bureaucratic red tape. It’s impractical, unworkable and unjust.’","Business for Britain, representing 800 business leaders, made proposals .

"By . Emma Thomas . This creative teacher has taken recycling to a whole new level by creating scale replicas of cars from old beer and coke cans. Sandy Sanderson, who lives in Hamilton, New Zealand, has been creating vehicles from aluminium cans for eight years. The colourful branding on the well-known cans forms the paintwork of hot rods, roadsters and other classic cars and even the steering wheels and headlights are painstakingly recreated. Detail: Some of the cars, like this buggy, took 30 cans to create although it looks as though it used less . Cola: The bright yellow branding of this can forms a brilliant paintwork for the model . Hot rod: The raised engine was another detail that brought this classic car to life . Beer can: The flimsy aluminium is painstakingly bent into shape to create the bodywork of the car . Mr Sanderson, who moved to New Zealand from England, originally trained as a draughtsman before retraining as a technology teacher. After he emigrated, he became interested in creating scale models of aircraft, classic cars and bikes from kits. A keen bass player, it was when he got to 40 years old while he was designing and building string instruments, that he had an accident and shattered his left wrist. His dreams of becoming a full-time instrument repairman were halted but it was while he was recovering he came up with idea. Grille: The corrugated grille on this model is created perfectly from tiny strips of the lager can . Can cars: Sandy Sanderson has created these mini masterpieces from what some people would throw away . Labour of love: Mr Sanderson has been creating these cars since he had an accident eight years ago . Even the ring pull is used on this car as Mr Sanderson said he got the idea while recovering from an accident . Scale: The model even has a tiny steering wheel and miniature dashboard dials . He stopped throwing away the recyclable cans and started experimenting. He'd seen model aircraft built from cans before, but only using the plain interior aluminum. So he expanded upon the idea and built his first car in 2006, the Coruba Climax, made from 8 Coruba & Cola cans. He's since built a number of incredible 'Can Cars', each individually designed with care and amazing attention to detail. Mr Sanderson moved to New Zealand from England and originally trained as a draughtsman . Branding: The writing on the outside of a Guinness can is still visible in the interior of the model car . First car: Mr Sanderson built his first car in 2006, the Coruba Climax, made from 8 Coruba & Cola cans . Coca Cola: This buggy has a speedo and a set of pedals as well as a tiny handbrake all made from the can . Vehicles include classics such as the Roadster, Jeep and Moke and are made from such classically designed cans as Coca Cola, 7-Up, Heineken and Guinness, among others. Each vehicle can take up to 30 cans, like the Waikato Buggy, to manufacture. The CanCars are available for purchase or, for the adventurous, plans are available to build your own version of Sandy's CanCars. Writing on his website, Mr Sanderson said: 'I have always religiously recycled but often spent time looking at the graphics on the can and looking at the shape of the bottom thinking ""That could make a really cool wheel"". 'I decided to put pencil to paper and try and make a racing car using the bottoms of cans as its wheels, and the graphics as the decoration for the body. Windows: This hot rod even has the standard red brake lights and circular windows in the back . Mr Sanderson had model aircraft built from cans before, but only using the plain interior aluminum . Classics: Vehicles include such classics as the Roadster, Jeep and Moke and are made from several cans . He's since built a number of incredible 'Can Cars', each designed with care and attention to detail . 'During the design stage, but more importantly during the construction, great care must be taken to ensure that the graphics on the can match up from one panel to the next. For what may appear to be just one can moving across a bonnet and down around a mudguard there could actually be five or six  cans used to create that effect. 'Some of the cars have required over 30 cans for their construction. 'Due to the cans being as thin as a piece of paper, a wooden inner structure had to be made to support the flimsy shell before carefully cutting and creasing the panels to shape. 'Other materials used include superglue, galvanised wire, electrical cable, tiny nuts and bolts, and washers, aluminium tubing and a few pins from a sewing kit. Sandy Sanderson started designing the cars when he shattered his wrist in an accident and couldn't work . Mr Sanderson said: 'I have always religiously recycled but often spent time looking at the graphics on the can' Although these are not models of real cars, the size of them would put them at about 1:10 scale . 'The small details that can be included really do add enormously to the effect. 'Although these are not models of real cars, the size of them would put them at about 1:10 scale. They do not have any working features, just nice to look at.' For pricing and availability, visit sandyscancars.com.","Sandy Sanderson has been creating cars from cans for eight years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Arizona mother of seven charged with drug trafficking in Mexico has proclaimed her innocence in a jailhouse interview and said she never had the drugs she is accused of trying to smuggle into the United States. Yanira Maldonado says she has been relying on her faith and the support of her family to keep her spirits up as she fights for her freedom. 'I've been reading the scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,' Maldonado told CNN. 'And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children, and everybody out there reaching out to help.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tearful appear: Yanira Maldonado wept as she proclaimed her innocence from an office in a Mexican federal prison . Shocked: Mrs Maldonado said she never saw the drugs she is accused of smuggling - not even after she was arrested . In the tearful interview - which Maldonado gave from what appears to be an office in Nogales, Mexico, federal prison - the devout Mormon mother said she was shocked when Mexican military officers announced that they had found 12 pounds of marijuana beneath her bus seat after the bus was stopped at a military checkpoint. 'I was at the checkpoint. They asked us to get off bus. And they were checking for drugs or I don't know what else,' she said. 'And they say they found something under my seat. But I never saw anything. They didn't show me anything. It was just amazing all that, what they did.' In the interview, Maldonado, who said she had traveled to Mexico to attend a funeral for her aunt, said she is a religious family woman who was innocent of the charges leveled against her. 'I'm a good mom. I love the gospel. I'm LDS. And we work hard to have what we have. You know, we're not rich, but we're very honest and we always do our best to help other people,' she said. Maldonado's family has accused the army officers of framing her in an effort to extort a bribe. The government has not yet presented its evidence against Maldonado in court. A Mexican state official told CNN that it appears Maldonado was, indeed, framed. Evidence? Mexican officials claim these are the marijuana bundles that were found under Yanira Maldonado's bus seat . 'Can you imagine? A passenger by himself or herself would have been unable to carry almost six kilos (12 pounds) of marijuana onto a bus without being noticed. She must've been framed,' the official, who asked not to be named, said. Her family said on Wednesday that they are terrified she'll 'be lost' forever inside the country's poorly run prison system as they fight to get her free. Maldonado's brother-in-law, Brandon Klippel, said the Mormon mother-of-seven from Phoenix had already been transferred to a different prison without their knowledge, and the family is frightened it'll happen again. 'One of the things the attorney said to us right in the beginning is that once you’re in the federal prison system (in Mexico), they move you around without keeping good records,' he said on the Today show. 'If she's moved and transported around, we may never see our sister again, and that's something that would just be devastating to our family.' Separated: Yanira Maldonado was with her husband Gary, both pictured, when they were stopped in Mexico and accused of smuggling drugs. Mr Maldonado remains in a Mexican prison . Please go to NBC Today for more videos. Klippel spoke out as Maldonado's daughter Anna Soto told NBC's Miguel Almaguer how the whole ordeal feels 'like it's a movie.' 'It's unbelievable,' Soto said. 'I feel like it's a movie, a nightmare. I want to wake up. There's no way to, and I'm like there's no way to escape.' The woman has been moved from Hermosillo to a jail in Nogales, Mexico, just across the border from Arizona. She'd not yet been charged with a crime, and a court hearing is scheduled for today. On Tuesday, witnesses testified to help Maldonado's case. She claims drugs allegedly found beneath her bus seat during a police raid last week were planted there by soldiers, left by a previous passenger, or perhaps were never there at all. A magistrate in Nogales has until 6 p.m. Friday to rule on her case or she will be sent to another facility for what could be several months behind bars.

Fears: Brandon Klippel, center, told Savannah Guthrie that his sister had already been transferred to a different prison without their knowledge . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . Soto visited her mother in prison on Saturday, and described the facility as 'not very professional.' 'Luckily we both speak English and we got to talk a little bit, but I didn't feel comfortable about anything there,' she told Savannah Guthrie, adding that guards stood over her shoulder the entire time. The family has launched a Facebook page in a bid to clear name of the woman who is a naturalized U.S. citizen but was born in Mexico. The U.S. State Department and Arizona Senator Jeff Flake say they are communicating with Mexican authorities and the Maldonado family. 'She's scared,' said Klippel, who told Today he spoke with her by phone. 'She's in a prison that's got horrible conditions. She's not very happy at all about the situation as you can imagine, but she's very hopeful.' The family claimed earlier this week that Maldonado was thrown in prison for smuggling marijuana after her family failed to bribe a judge soon enough. 'Innocent': The Maldonados, who are Mormon, said they do not even drink and have never taken drugs . Family: The couple, who have seven children between them . Maldonado was returning home with her . husband after attending her aunt's funeral in Mexico when their bus was . stopped and police claimed drugs had been found beneath her seat. When she was hauled into a prison, an . attorney told her husband Gary to raise money to give to a judge . because 'that's how it works here', her family said. But . when the couple, who have seven children and two grandchildren between . them, scraped together $5,000 for her release, they still refused to . free her. Her . family is now seeking the help of their state Senator and hoping to . raise awareness of her plight, praying it will lead to her release. They claim that the Mormon mother, who does not drink or take drugs, is innocent. Maldonado . and her husband were returning to Phoenix from her aunt's funeral when . their bus was stopped at a military checkpoint near Hermosillo. When the federales . searched the bus, they claimed they found drugs under a seat where the . couple - the only Americans onboard - had been sitting. 'Bribes': The couple were told they could pay off the judge because 'that's how things work here' They initially charged Mr Maldonado but then let him go before charging his wife instead. 'Never in our lives deal with drugs or do drugs,' Mr Maldonado told Fox 10. 'Everybody from the very beginning was telling us, ""We know you guys aren't guilty, but this is just the process"".' He called it 'the most frightening . feeling you could ever imagine', adding that fellow passengers saw them . board the bus without packages, so he is hopeful that justice with . prevail. A Mexican attorney told the couple to raise cash, Mrs Maldonado's brother-in-law Brandon Klippel told CBS 5. 'His . attorney had talked to the prosecuting attorney there and came back . to him and said, ""You know how it works in Mexico, right?""' Klippel . said. 'He said, ""No I don't."" The attorney said, ""Well, if we . bribe the judge – then he'll let you go"".' But when they took the money to them, they were told it was no longer about the money. A couple of days after her arrest, she was transferred to a women's jail in Nogales, but the family was not informed. When her husband went to visit her, he was told she had been sent elsewhere. 'He panicked,' his brother, Klippel, . said. 'He told me terror struck him. And he thought, for that period of . time, that he'd never see his wife again.' Stopped: The couple were returning from a funeral when they were stopped at a checkpoint (file picture) But on Saturday, he tracked her down to the holding cell and visited with one of their sons. 'She had a rough night,' Klippel said. 'Their interrogation included putting her in a non-air-conditioned room . and waking her up several times in the middle of night – trying to get . her to sign documents that she said she couldn't read.' Family members said Mrs Maldonado had started crying during the visit, but said that she had faith others would help. Senator Jeff Flake's office said he is personally monitoring the situation and has spoken with the deputy Mexican ambassador. Yanira Maldonado has an attorney and will appear at a hearing in front of a judge on Monday. 'In Mexico, I guess you're guilty until proven innocent,' said Klippel. 'So, it's just been a real nightmare for them.' The family is providing updates on their Facebook page.","Yanira Maldonado and her husband were stopped at military checkpoint on her way back to the U.S. from a funeral last week .

It is the result of a collaboration between the supercar firm, best known for its 268mph Veyron, and Roland Iten - a Swiss luxury company. Using watchmaking machinery, Roland Iten has created a solid rose gold and titanium belt with 100 moving, mechanical pieces. Each component is custom made and carved by precision laser from a solid block of gold or titanium. The belt, which is limited to just 11 units, comes with an eye-watering £60,000 price-tag. This makes it more expensive than a Porsche Cayman  - which costs £48,000 - and the same price as a new Range Rover Sport. But it is still considerably cheaper than a Bugatti Veyron SuperSport, which will set back a wealthy buyer £1.6million. Owners of the belt will be able to boast that their accessory, as the Roland Iten website states, is 'micro-customisable to any size within a 22mm range' and can be adjusted 'to the exact waist measurement'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is using the same app that caught him texting while driving last week. Last night, Zuckerberg found a scary-looking spider in his bathroom and posted a picture of it using the app Jelly. The app was developed by Twitter co-founder Biz Stone for crowd-sourcing questions from social media friends. Users post a picture with a question and other users contribute their answers. Scroll down for video . What's this? Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture of a spider in his bathroom using the app Jelly, the same app that caught him texting and driving last week . The app aided in the embarassment of Zuckerberg last week when user Ben Schaechter posted a picture of the Facebook founder texting while driving. 'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?' Schaechter wrote. But that hasn't stopped Zuckerberg from continuing to use the app. 'What kind of spider is this, and is it okay to let it keep living in my shower?' Zuckerberg queried his friends last night. The app's COO Kevin Thau answered the question, identifying the spider as a Phiddippus Johnsoni and said Zuckerberg should 'probably want to relocate it out of the house.' Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, right, launched Jelly last Tuesday. One user caught Mark Zuckerberg, left, while texting and driving and posted the picture on the app asking 'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?' While the spider is not poisonous, but it does bite and has the ability to jump. 'First life saved on Jelly! (The spider, not Zuck)' Stone later tweeted. The app has been called a 'vanity project' by critics despite Stone believing it can grow into an 'awesome business'. Stone thinks the app will help teach people that computer-driven algorithms don't necessarilly have all the answers in life. ‘If we are successful, then we will be introducing into the daily muscle memory of a whole lot of people this idea of, “How can I help someone today?”’ said Stone. ‘Maybe we can sort of nudge up the global empathy quotient so people start thinking about other people a little more.’ But some critics aren’t so sure, Valleywag has described it as ‘an app for the sake of apps’, a ‘software Fabergé egg’ and a ‘vanity project.’ Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerman was caught texting and driving in his black Volkswagen GTI last week . Ben Schaechter was quick to put the Jelly app to good use and posted his photo of the Facebook founder along with the words 'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?' ‘Have you ever posted on Facebook, asking if anyone knows a good . barber? Or tweeted to your followers asking if ""House of Cards"" is any . good? That's Jelly - a search engine that uses your friends - only more . convoluted than ever before,’ wrote Valleywag’s Sam Biddle. Stone, . 39, can afford to gamble on a company with an altruistic bent after . Twitter's successful public stock offering two months ago. Twitter's . stock has more than doubled from its initial public offering price of . $26. Just how many millions Stone has made from Twitter remains a . mystery because he didn't own enough stock for his stake to be disclosed . in regulatory filings. He has also persuaded former Vice . President Al Gore and U2 lead singer Bono to invest, as well as Reid . Hoffman, who became a billionaire as co-founder and chairman of . professional networking service LinkedIn Corp. The venture capital firm Spark Capital also has invested an undisclosed amount. Eventually, Jelly's app will extend its reach into other online networks besides Twitter and Facebook, Stone said.","The Facebook founder posted a picture of a spider in his bathroom on app Jelly last night .

"By . Tom Gardner . A pastor has forgiven a man accused of stabbing him 37 times and leaving him for dead after coming face to face with his alleged attacker in an emotion-charged court room. Kevin Ramsby was savagely attacked by a burglar who broke into his home in Highland Park, Michigan. Doctors thought he stood no chance of surviving his horrific wounds and called his wife to rush to the hospital before it was too late. Forgiveness: Pastor Kevin Ramsby tells local media that he has forgiven his attacker for the brutal stabbing which nearly killed him . But, miraculously, the pastor survived and on Tuesday looked his alleged attacker Wesley McLemore in the eye during a preliminary court hearing. Showing no bitterness, the man of God told ABC Action News: 'I’ve been forgiven much in my life. So for me it’s not too hard to forgive others when you’ve been forgiven yourself.' McLemore, 41, was arrested in Alabama, four months after the attack and has now been extradited back to Michigan to face trial. Proceedings have been delayed for two weeks before the case can come before a jury. Accused: Wesley McLemore, pictured, was arrested four month after the attack on Pastor Ramsby . Reconciliation: Victim and alleged attacker come face to face during a preliminary court hearing . But Pastor Ramsby told ABC Action News: 'It’s been long awaited and I’m glad it’s here.' He added: 'Today . I signed that I would, and asked and requested that if I could have an . opportunity to sit down with him and speak with him I would want to if . he would be willing.' The priest also revealled how traumatic and life-changing the event two years ago had been. He . spent weeks in hospital recovering from the physical wounds and almost . five months or daily therapy trying to heal the mental scars. But the attack has not prevented him returning to his flock at Revival Tabernacle. Pastor Ramsby vowed shortly after the incident to concentrate on turning the horrific ordeal into something positive. He has set about turning a bookstore near his church into a new ministry for young men.","Pastor Kevin Ramsby nearly died during burglary at his Michigan home .

"By . Helen Pow . Charged: Qawmane Wilson, 24, pictured, has been charged with murder and home invasion in the September 2012 death of his mother, Yolanda Holmes, 45, who was a well-known owner of a beauty salon . A Chicago man is accused of plotting his mother's murder to get access to $90,000 of savings and her two life insurance policies. Qawmane Wilson, 24, of North Austin, has been charged with murder and home invasion in the September 2012 death of his mother, Yolanda Holmes, 45, a well-known owner of a beauty salon, whose name is tattooed on his shoulder. Wilson's friends Eugene Spencer, 22, and Loriana Johnson, 23, are also charged in the slaying. Prosecutors say Spencer killed Holmes, and Johnson served as Spencer's driver. On Tuesday, Cook County Judge Adam Bourgeois, Jr. called the murder a 'heinous act' and ordered all three suspects held without bail. Immediately following the hearing, a relative of both Wilson and Holmes collapsed in the hall outside bond court, sobbing, the Chicago Tribune reported. Holmes was the owner of the Nappy Headz salon in Uptown Chicago. She was killed at around 4:15 a.m. September 2 at her home in the 1000 block of West Montrose Avenue, authorities said. She died of multiple stab wounds and a gunshot wound to her head. Wilson was arrested Sunday after detectives determined he had arranged to 'have his mother murdered,' police told the Tribune. Assistant State's Attorney Maura White said Wilson was the 'sole beneficiary' of his mother's assets, including two life insurance policies, White said. One week after Holmes' death, Wilson liquidated $90,000 from of his mother’s bank accounts, White said. Ayonna Anderson, one of Holmes’ friends, told the Chicago Sun-Times Tuesday that she was stunned to learn that Wilson might be involved in his mother's death. Accomplices: Wilson's friends Eugene Spencer, 22, right, and Loriana Johnson, 23, left, are also charged in the slaying. Prosecutors say Spencer killed Holmes, and Johnson served as Spencer's driver . 'She gave him everything he wanted,' said Anderson, a hair stylist who worked in Holmes' salon. 'He wasn't hurting for nothing. Why would you have your mother killed?' Anderson said Holmes was a single mother and that Wilson, as a boy, would often spend time at the salon. 'He was a salon baby,' Anderson said. 'Everybody know him. We would never think he was capable of doing that. She was a great mom.' Cell phone records revealed that Wilson called Spencer and Johnson 'before, during and after the murder,' White said. Both Wilson and Spencer admitted their respective roles in the scheme, she said. Spencer was arrested Monday and is charged with first degree murder, home invasion, and aggravated discharge of a firearm. Salon: Holmes was the owner of the Nappy Headz salon, pictured, in the 4100 block of North Broadway . Police say Johnson drove Spencer to and from Holmes' house. She was also arrested Monday and charged with murder and home invasion. According to the Tribune, Holmes was a fixture in the community and often used her salon in the 4100 block of North Broadway as a venue to publicize or host community events like back-to-school parties for young students. Family and friends said she was always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. 'She had a real nice personality, always trying to help people,' her uncle James Newman told the Chicago Tribune. Joseph Adibu, who owns the nearby Broadway Super Coin Laundry, said at the time: 'She is a very good person. For that to happen to her is a blow to a lot of us. It's very painful.' Wilson, Spencer and Johnson will spend Christmas in jail and are next scheduled to appear in court on January 13.","Qawmane Wilson, 24, has been charged with murder and home invasion in the September 2012 death of his mother, Yolanda Holmes .

"By . Tom Kelly . Alter ego: Grant Shapps poses as self-help guru Michael Green at a conference in Las Vegas in 2004 . According to his name badge, he is Michael Green, a ‘multi-million-dollar web marketer’ posing at an internet conference in a Las Vegas casino. But this is actually Tory chairman Grant Shapps, using an alter ego to promote his work as a leading self-help guru. The former housing minister was pictured using a nom de plume while he was a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Conservatives. He was standing for the Welwyn Hatfield seat in Hertfordshire when he posed for the photo at a £2,000-a-head web marketing event at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in 2004. Mr Shapps continued to use the name Michael Green for his business interests throughout the 2005 election campaign and his early years as an opposition MP. ‘Mr Green’ charged clients £183 an hour for advice on how to make money from the web as well as offering tips on how to beat the recession blues, including splashing out on a jet-ski or learning to play the guitar. It is the latest embarrassing  revelation to hit Mr Shapps since he was promoted in David Cameron’s recent reshuffle, including his admission he had edited information on his own Wikipedia page. Grant Shapps claimed he was born in London when he was running for a seat in the capital . Yesterday, it also emerged the MP apparently changed the description of where he was born depending on where he was standing for election. When he unsuccessfully ran for Parliament in 1997, in the South London seat of Southwark North and Bermondsey, his election leaflets described him as ‘a Londoner by birth’. But since his successful 2005 campaign to win Welwyn Hatfield, his  literature has stated that he was ‘born in Hertfordshire’. According to Mr Shapps’s Wikipedia profile, he was born in Watford. Labour MP Steve McCabe said: ‘Grant Shapps increasingly appears to be a Walter Mitty character. His multiple personalities and questionable business practices are becoming a major embarrassment to the Tories.’ Looking awkward: Grant Shapps arriving at 10 Downing Street on the day of the reshuffle . Mr Shapps has admitted using the name Michael Green to help him differentiate between his political and business activities. Between 2004 and 2009, he ran  a website called MichaelGreen- Consulting.com, part of the company HowToCorp, created in 2000. In 2008, he passed his share of the firm behind HowToCorp to his wife Belinda, who then took over the Michael Green pen name. Since then, he has had no involvement in it. A Tory Party spokesman said: ‘Grant had a career in business before entering politics. He is completely open about this.’ He added that the description of Mr Shapps being born in London was a ‘genuine mistake’ and that the leaflets were later corrected.","He told voters he was born in London at one election and born in Hertfordshire at another .

"By . Laura Cox . Fans of family-friendly TV series Doc Martin turned against the programme’s makers after a violent car crash formed a plot twist in the latest instalment of the usually sedate show. Many of the six million viewers – including children – were left horrified after Doc Martin’s wife was unexpectedly hit by a car, prompting many to vent their distaste on social networking sites. Following the accident, which left Louisa Glasson, played by Caroline Catz, with a broken collar bone, a viewer wrote: ‘I wasn’t expecting that! Not sure my nerves can take it!’ Video below... Doc Martin fans were left reeling after the Louisa Glasson, wife of Martin Clunes's character was hit by a car . Louisa Glasson and Doctor Martin Ellingham rowed at a sports day before he stormed off . Another wrote: ‘Louisa getting hit by that car looked so real.’ Others said: ‘That car hitting Louisa made me scream out loud!!’ ‘Doc Martin- My heart literally just stopped. Why Louisa?’ It comes a week after Downton Abbey fans were left appalled by a violent rape scene, which critics condemned as a ploy to make the  drama more exciting. Meanwhile TV campaigners said the twist in the episode of Doc Martin was inappropriate for a series that has a reputation for offering inoffensive content suitable for children, even though it was shown after the 9pm watershed. Pippa Smith, co-chairman of campaign group Safermedia, said: ‘It was far too graphic even if it was on at 9pm. We also know that children will be watching. As she chased her husband across the road, Louisa is hit by a car and breaks her collar bone . The distressing scene culminates in her lying on the ground and being treated by her husband . 'It is not the sort of thing you would . expect from this series and seems to be following a recent trend towards . harder more unpleasant story lines as we have seen in the normally . gentle Downton Abbey. 'This is not entertainment.’ And Vivienne Pattison, director of  MediaWatch, urged broadcasters to consider using warnings ahead of unusually graphic scenes. Last night an ITV spokesman said: ‘Details of the storyline had been trailed in advance of transmission.’ In the show, Louisa Glasson was seen chasing after her husband Doctor Martin Ellingham, played by Martin Clunes, after they had rowed. Blowing on a plastic whistle and . shouting after his retreating figure she is seen running across a . country road when a car unexpectedly appears and smashes into her . causing her to roll onto the bonnet before tumbling to the ground. Doc Martin, now in its sixth series, is set in a sleepy Cornish seaside town and stars Martin Clunes in the title role. It airs on Mondays between 9pm and 10pm.

Vervia Todd developed a secret obsession with fine clothing after the death of her fiance during the Second World War, travelling abroad each year to develope her collection, but keeping her amazing wardorbe before the discovery after her death last year. Vervia, who was 92 when she died last November, never remarried after the tragic loss of her husband in her early twenties, and instead took the annual holidays on her own until the very last years of her life. Each year she would buy a new suitcase . and fill it with the finest specially-made clothing, only to stash it . away unpacked upon her return. Vervia Todd, pictured right on her retirement day, and left at about age 10, died last year leaving a vast collection of vintage couture . Many of the clothes remained hidden for over half a century, with one designer dress even being found up the chimney. Vervia . closed off rooms full of clothes in her three-story townhouse in . Houghton Le-Spring, County Durham, hoarding her vast collection of . couture and designer pieces over a period of seventy years.

The vast collection, which no one realised existed, has taken 13 months to sort an organise . In one of the . bedrooms, the faded floral wallpaper is hung upside down, whilst a . once-opulent stand-alone bath dominates the archaic bathroom. Vervia had remained . tight-lipped about her phenomenal style stash, with friends and . relatives only discovering the stunning collection when they came to . empty her home after her death. Now, . the mesmerising collection of vintage dresses, hats and shoes has been . uncovered, and is set to sell for the staggering six figure sum. Vervia’s . best friend Sheila Ellis, 65, and cousin Ann, have spent over a year . uncovering endless trunks in the house where Vervia lived since the age . of one. But now the pair, . who are the executors of Vervia’s will, are hoping that the clothes will . be given a new lease of life by their new owners. Vervia’s fiance tragically died whilst fighting in Arnhem in the Netherlands. She never married and spent her life alone in the house after the death of her father, Sam Todd, a dental surgeon. She said it just wasn’t meant to be,' said Sheila, a friend of Vervia’s for 30 years. 'She was a glamorous lady when she was younger. She had a very good figure, very trim.

'I picked it up and put it in the . rubbish pile and saw something glint and when I looked closer I realised . it was a Marshall and Snelgrove dress.

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . and Ap . Just days after it was announced that he signed a contract with the New York Jets, controversial NFL quarterback Michael Vick's past continues to haunt him - but his older brother seems to have his back. Vick, who served 21 months in a federal prison for his involvement in a violent dogfighting ring, was the target of a virtual jab from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in the form of a snarky comment posted on Twitter. 'At least Michael Vick can’t drown, electrocute, hang, or shoot a . football the way he terrorized ""man’s best friend."" #smh #Jets,” the . organization tweeted Saturday afternoon, after it apparently got word of his new contract in New York. PETA: Michael Vick is still getting criticized by PETA for his involvement in a violent dog-fighting ring . Big bro: Vick's older brother, Marcus, hit back at PETA for its comments about his little brother . Not happy with PETA's dig at his little brother, Marcus Vick responded by firing off a tweet of his own. 'y’all still on that bulls–t???? Smh #Peta,' Marcus tweeted in response. The Jets signed the former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback to a one-year deal Friday, and released Mark Sanchez, the one-time face of the franchise. The younger Vick - who since being released from prison has been a vocal animal rights advocate - seems more interested in playing football than he does with starting a Twitter war with PETA. 'Anywhere I go, or any team, I'm always going to compete for the No. 1 spot,' Vick said last week of his upcoming battle for the starter job with quarterback Geno Smith. 'And I will encourage any other quarterback behind me or in front of me to always compete for their job, for the No. 1 spot. 'That's how champions are made.' Prisoner: Vick served 21 months in a federal prison for his involvement in a violent dog-fighting ring . Vick was a free agent after spending the last five seasons with the Eagles. 'I really enjoyed getting to know him over the last five years,' Eagles chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement in which he thanked Vick. 'He always represented our team with a tremendous amount of class.' Vick thanked the Eagles, their fans and the city of Philadelphia in an open letter posted on The Philadelphia Inquirer's website. 'I was honored to be their quarterback and took the privilege to heart every day,' he wrote of his former team. Vick, a four-time Pro Bowl selection who will be 34 in June, was once considered the most dynamic player in the NFL, particularly during his first six NFL seasons with the Atlanta Falcons. His playing career was abruptly halted for two seasons in 2007 when he pleaded guilty to being part of a dog fighting ring. He served 21 months in federal prison, and two more in home confinement. QB: Vick plans to fight for the starter job in New York with the team's current quarterback Geno Smith . Since his release in 2009, Vick has worked with the Humane Society of the United States to help stop organized animal fighting. The move drew mixed reviews by Jets fans on Twitter and message boards, but that didn't concern Vick. I appreciate all the Jets fans who appreciate me and accept me for who I am and what I've become, not for what I've done,' Vick said. 'Right now, my past is irrelevant.' 'I came to New York to play football,' Vick continued. 'That's what I came to New York to do. I came to New York to play football. As long as I have a uniform on, I'm good.'","Michael Vick was signed to a one-year deal with the New York Jets .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Michelle Singleton or Catherine Harris? 66-year-old Singleton has been living in a houseboat under the alias Harris for 18 years . A 66-year-old missing woman who failed to appear in court 18 years ago for payroll check fraud has been found on a houseboat in Key West. Michele Singleton, 66, of Kansas City was called to federal court in 1996 and she didn't show up. Since then, a federal fugitive warrant was issued for her arrest. Instead of facing the authorities, Singleton changed her name to Catherine Harris and went into hiding on a boat moored at 15 Hilton Haven Drive thinking no one would ever discover her true identity. She was wrong. NBC reports that when Monroe County detectives obtained a photo of singleton, Sgt. Donald Catala  said that he had seen the woman many times in Key West. A records check of the area showed a woman named Catherine Harris living at the Hilton Haven address whose license photo was suspiciously familiar to a photo of Singleton. When the Secret Service went to Singleton's houseboat to investigate her identity they asked her for an id and all she had was an expired license. They then asked her for a birth certificate and when she pulled out her file, important papers fell out including her real birth certificate and social security card. Cornered, Singleton told police that she'd gotten a birth certificate with the name Harris after she'd fled Kansas City. Singleton admitted to being her true identity and has been taken into custody on fugitive charges. According to Keys Net, Singleton was planning to sell her houseboat and then move to the Dominican Republic. 15 Hilton Haven Road, Key West, Florida where Singleton kept her boat .","Michele Singleton, 66, of Kansas City has had a federal arrest warrant for payroll check fraud since 1996 .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Stephen Doughty . and William Turvill . The marksman who killed Mark Duggan (pictured) will be allowed to return to armed duties, it has emerged . The marksman who killed Mark Duggan will be allowed to have his gun back and return to armed police duties, it emerged last night. The officer, granted anonymity and known as V53, was taken off armed duties after the incident in August 2011. And last week a jury decided his claim that Duggan was holding a gun when he was killed was incorrect. However, he was judged to have killed lawfully, and commander Neil Basu, head of armed policing in London, told the Guardian: ‘If he volunteered to carry a firearm again I would want him to do that.’ The paper reported that police have contacted the family to say preparations are underway to reinstate V53 as an armed officer. The family described the decision as an ‘insult’. The news comes after the coroner who led the inquest revealed he is to ask Duggan's family for their views on how armed police should tackle dangerous criminals. Keith Cutler, a judge who sat as coroner at the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice, said the dead man’s family will be invited to submit their ideas on potential reforms to high-risk operations. The circuit judge said the ‘unusual, perhaps unique’ decision could influence his recommendations. The findings, which are likely to . focus on the use of body-worn cameras, training and police statements, . will be presented to the Home Secretary next month. But . the move is likely to provoke outrage from the police rank-and-file, . some of whom question why the Duggan family has been treated with ‘kid . gloves’. One official . close to the Met’s inquest team said: ‘It’s the equivalent of asking the . families of murder victims to rule on sentencing policy. This is hard . to swallow.’ Judge Cutler . has already faced questions about his handling of the inquest, . particularly after its final moments descended into near anarchy at the . High Court. Coroner Keith Cutler is to ask the family of Mark Duggan for their views on how armed police should tackle dangerous criminals . Duggan’s younger brother Marlon had . to be physically restrained as he shouted abuse and threats in the wake . of the lawful killing ruling. The . three-month inquest was marred by the constant barracking of witnesses . by supporters of Duggan and began with a 20-second silence held in his . memory. Speaking . publicly for the first time yesterday, Judge Cutler said he wants . ‘transparency for all parties and the public’ over his recommendations. ‘In that spirit I am taking the unusual, . perhaps unique, step of inviting submissions from all the interested . parties including the Duggan family,’ he said. Defending the 20-second . silence, Judge Cutler, 63, added: ‘I thought that a few moments . reflection at the start of the inquest might be quite healing.’ This photograph shows Mark Duggan's family, including aunt Carole Duggan, outside the High Court last week . Meanwhile, the police marksman who killed Duggan will be allowed to have his gun back and return to armed duties, it emerged last night.

Commander Neil Basu, head of armed policing in London, told the Guardian: ‘If he volunteered to carry a firearm again I would want him to do that.’ Meanwhile, an MP boycotted a vigil for Duggan because he feared it would be hijacked by violent mobs.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Horrendous: Shawn Custis, 43, has been indicted on seven counts after being caught on camera beating a woman in her home last year . A home invader whose vicious attack on a mother in front of her child was captured on the family's 'nanny cam' last year has been indicted on seven counts, including attempted murder. Shawn Custis, 43, was caught on camera repeatedly kicking and punching a Millburn woman before throwing her down the stairs as her terrified three-year-old daughter cowered on the sofa on June 21. The woman was left with a concussion, chipped teeth, an injured lip, facial swelling and leg injuries. The convicted robber was today indicted by a grand jury of attempted murder, first-degree robbery, second-degree burglary, third-degree endangering the welfare of a child, third-degree criminal restraint, third-degree theft, and second-degree aggravated assault, according to nj.com. The horrific attack sparked outrage when police released the footage in a bid to track down the perpetrator. Custis was arrested a week after the attack when police released his photo and name. The disturbing video shows the moment Curstis broke into the woman's home about 10am as she and her child watched television. The woman's 18-month-old son was sleeping in an upstairs room. Curtis began to attack the helpless mother who later told NBC4 she was afraid to cry out in case it made her daughter scream and anger her attacker. Scroll down for video . Arrested: A week after the June 21, 2013, attack, Shawn Custis was arrested when police released his name and picture . 'I . knew that if I started screaming, my daughter would, too, and I was . afraid she would get hurt. I took it. I didn’t cry the entire time,' she said. After punching and kicking the woman at least 16 times, video shows the attacker turn and speak to the woman's daughter. At one point, the invader seems to make physical contact with the child, but she was not injured. The woman's husband was at work in New York City when the invasion took place. The robber made off with an undetermined amount of jewelry, according to NBC News. Police . believe the suspect thought he would be alone when he entered the home . as the blinds were drawn and there was no car in the driveway. Deeply shaken: The young mother was tossed around ruthlessly, and beaten and kicked over and over as her infant son slept upstairs and cartoons played on the television . Merciless: The woman was kicked and punched even as she lay helplessly on the ground and the thief appears to pocket items from her person or the table beside her . Custis is being held on $750,000 bail and is scheduled to be arraigned on February 28 before Superior Court Judge Peter J. Vazquez, nj.com reported. Olubukola 'Buki' Adetula, a pool attorney representing Custis, said his client would enter a not guilty plea at next month's arraignment. Custis pleaded not guilty to the charges in July. 'It is our intent to defend this case as aggressively as possible in a court of law,' Adetula said. Custis is reportedly no stranger to the criminal justice system. Nj.com last year reported the man has been in and out of jail for robbery, assault, resisting arrest, eluding police, theft and forgery convictions.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Fifty years after the assassination of President John F Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, researchers are still investigating his mysterious murder. Thousands of pages pertaining to the assassination are still sealed, and researchers are calling for a complete public release. Jefferson Morley, former Washington Post Reporter currently suing the CIA to release the data, is most interested in a file containing about 300 pages on the now-deceased CIA agent George Joannides. Scroll down for video . Call for transparency: Even fifty years after JFK's assassination, thousands of documents relating to the killing remained sealed . Joannides, Morley believes, may have . had contact with suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the . shooting and later served as Langley's liaison for a JFK assassination . investigation in the 1970s. Who is George Joannides? Researchers believe that files on the CIA agent may reveal the suspected JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald had a connection at Langley . The . first official investigation found that Lee Harvey Oswald was acting . alone, after failing to get a visa to Cuba and his wife Marina rejected . his attempts at reconciliation. Another . investigation in the mid-1970s said that the assassination was probably . a conspiracy, after discovering audio files suggesting a second . shooter. These . contradicting opinions have led many to come up with conspiracy theories . behind the president's death replacing the initial conclusion that Oswald . acted alone. Morley doesn't . believe that the documents will reveal any big conspiracy, but it may . prove that the CIA did know of Oswald before the shooting. That . would contradict the first investigation's findings that Kennedy's . assassination was carried out by a lone-ranger, a completely random act . that couldn't have been prevented. Morley . believes that Oswald may have been in contact with Joannides due to his . noted involvement in an pro-Castro organization. Oswald's membership in . the Fair Play for Cuba Committee was confirmed when he was captured by a . local television station in an altercation with anti-Castro . demonstrators. But . investigators later found that Oswald had pamphlets in his possession . with an address of a local anti-Castro operation connected to a former . FBI agent. Researchers believe those pamphlets mean that Oswald was working with counterintelligence to discredit his pro-Castro group. If . that's the case he would have been in contact with George Joannides the . CIA case officer for the anti-Castro Student Revolutionary Directorate - . the same group Oswald got in a brawl with. Counter intelligence: Evidence of Oswald's connection to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Researchers believe he may have been working from within to undermine the pro-Castro group . If Oswald was in contact with Joannides, it means that the CIA concealed the fact that Oswald was on their radar. But Joannides connection to the assassination doesn't end there. A . second investigation into the assassination convened in the mid-1970s . and this time weighing audio evidence of a possible second shooter. In . the end the committee reported that the president was 'probably . assassinated as the result of a conspiracy. The committee is unable to . identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy.' The . committee sifted through thousands of CIA records, and their liaison to . Langley at the time was none other than George Joannides, . G . Robert Blakey, the committee's chief counsel, recalled how the CIA . brought in Joannides to act as a middleman to help fill requests for . documents made by committee researchers. House Assassinations Committee chief counsel G. Robert Blakey, second left, meets with committee chairman Louis Stokes, left, before a closed session investigating the death of JFK . 'He was put in a position to edit everything we were given before it was given to us,' Blakey said. But Blakey didn't learn about Joannides' past until Morley unearthed it in files declassified years later. George Joannides, middle, being presented with an award in 1981 for 28 years of service, flanked by his wife and U.S. Navy Adm. B.R. Inman, director of the CIA . 'If . I'd known Joannides was the case officer for the DRE, he couldn't have . been liaison; he would have been a witness,' Blakey told The Associated . Press. Morley . does not suggest the Joannides files point to agency involvement in the . assassination itself, but more likely that their release would show the . CIA trying to keep secret its own flawed performance before the . assassination. 'The . idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was some unknown quantity to CIA officers . was false,' Morley said. 'There was this incredible high-level attention . to Oswald on the eve of the assassination.' Assuming that Oswald fired the fatal shot, he said, 'These top CIA case officers are guilty of negligence.' Blakey . isn't optimistic about getting all of the documents from the . intelligence agency, citing the agencies lack of cooperation with three . previous investigations. 'That's . three agencies that they were supposed to be fully candid with,' he . said. 'And now they're taking the position that some of these documents . can't be released even today.' 'Why are they continuing to fight tooth and nail to avoid doing something they'd promised to do?'

"By . James Slack . Approved: most of those being granted passports arrived in 2008 . More than two million immigrants have been granted British citizenship since 2000, it can be revealed. In the past year alone, a record 204,541 requests for a UK passport were rubber-stamped by the Home Office, official figures show. This is the equivalent of one migrant being given citizenship every two-and-a-half minutes – the fastest rate in history. It means the total number given out since the turn of the century now stands at 2,053,396. Campaigners say the face of British society has been changed for ever in just 13 years. The main beneficiaries are from India, Pakistan, Nigeria, China and the Philippines. Once approved, new citizens are treated in the same way as anybody else with a British passport, including no restrictions on access to housing, benefits or the jobs market. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch, said the figures were ‘the inevitable consequence’ of Labour’s deliberate policy of mass immigration. The majority of those currently being given passports arrived in 2008 or earlier. Normally, they qualify for citizenship after living and working in the UK for five years, with officials only able to block those engaged in criminality. Sir Andrew said: ‘Some four million foreign immigrants have arrived since 1997 of whom, so far, half appear to have qualified for citizenship. After being in the country for five years immigrants are offered indefinite leave to remain, unless they have committed a crime . ‘However, nobody seems to have the slightest idea how to integrate these people into our society in such a short time.’ The two million new citizens are entitled to vote in general elections, and critics, including Migrationwatch, have long insisted Labour adopted a deliberate policy of mass immigration for political reasons. They cite remarks by former Labour speech writer Andrew Neather, who boasted the aim of its immigration strategy was to ‘rub the Right’s nose in diversity’. The latest revelations, based on the Home Office’s own figures, come at a time when the Tories are battling to bring immigration under control. Officials are now approving citizenship bids faster than at the height of Labour’s open-door policy, in 2009, when a then-record 203,789 were rubber stamped. The figures also shed new light on ministers’ claims that two-thirds of new jobs are going to ‘British workers’. They point to the fact that, over the past year, the number of UK nationals in work has risen by 208,000 – compared with an increase of 98,000 in the foreign workforce. But much of this increase is down to people who were born abroad being handed British passports, rather than UK-born people finding work. If the figures are recalculated based on a person’s place of birth, only 98,000 new jobs have gone to people born in Britain. The vast majority – 204,000 – were born overseas. The numbers given permission to settle permanently, the last stage before applying for a passport, also rose by nine per cent in the year to June, to 153,000. There are three main routes to British citizenship, which was granted to only 82,210 people in 2000. Last year 204,000 jobs were taken by people born overseas, compared with 98,000 British nationals . The main one is residence. After living here for a fixed-period of time – normally five years – migrants apply for indefinite leave to remain. Last year, 111,637 qualified in this way. Significant numbers of passports were obtained through marriage to a British citizen, at 42,048, or by being the child of a British national, 45,772. In the previous year, to June 2012, 179,697 passports were given out – 14 per cent fewer. Migrants must also pass the Life in the UK multiple choice test – recently condemned as a ‘bad pub quiz’ by a Durham University academic. Dr Thom Brooks said the latest version fails to mention GCSEs or A-levels, or ‘practical necessities’ such as how to report a crime. Home Secretary Theresa May has been battling to get net migration – the number of people arriving in Britain, versus those leaving – under control. Ministers have promised to reduce it to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the next election. It had been falling steadily and was 153,000 in the year to September 2012. But, in a blow to the Government, it has risen to an estimated 176,000 a year. The rise was driven by a drop in the numbers leaving, from 351,000 to 321,000 in the year to December 2012, the Office for National Statistics said, while the number of arrivals fell from 566,000 to 497,000. Last night a Tory party spokesman said: ‘This shows we’re still seeing the consequences of Labour’s open-door immigration policy. We are tightening the rules and have cut net migration by a third since 2010.’ The Home Office said: ‘British citizenship is a privilege, not a right. We are toughening up language requirements for naturalisation and latest figures show applications for citizenship are falling. Immigration is at its lowest for a decade.’","Chairman of Migrationwatch blames Labour's policy of mass immigration .

Once Bale and the crew left the area, they were pursued by a grey minivan for over half-an-hour. 'What I really wanted to do is to shake the man's hand and say: ""Thank you,"" and tell him what an inspiration he is,'  a clearly disappointed Bale told CNN after the incident.

"By . Jill Reilly . Eddie Gibson disappeared aged 19 in October 2004 when he last made contact with his mother saying he was looking forward to coming home . The family of a British backpacker who went missing 10 years ago have been left in limbo amid reports that human remains found in Cambodia are not his. Eddie Gibson disappeared aged 19 in October 2004 when he last made contact with his mother saying he was looking forward to coming home. This week it emerged that his family were informed that human remains were found near a lake in Poipet near the Cambodian border with Thailand. Mike Gibson, the father of Eddie, from Hove, East Sussex, said the site has been secured as a crime scene as more bones, including a skull, have been discovered. A pair of underpants, possibly Calvin Klein's which Eddie wore, were found in the area and it is suspected the body found had a broken arm, which Eddie had. But reports in Cambodia say a joint investigation by the National Police and provincial authorities has ruled out the remains belonging to Eddie. The Cambodia Daily newspaper quoted provincial police chief Kheng Soum, who said the body belonged to an Asian person. He said: 'After police carried out tests on the bones we concluded that they belong to an Asian person between 30 and 40 years old and that the time of death was about five years ago.' Mike Gibson, the father of Eddie, from Hove, East Sussex, said the site has been secured as a crime scene as more bones, including a skull, have been discovered . Eddie¿s dental records are now being sent to the Far East to help in the identification process as his family said they hope to bring closure to years of heartache . Mr Gibson said he was treating the . information coming out of Cambodia with caution. He said: 'The . information that we were given contradicts what we have subsequently . heard. 'That worries me, and I want to get to the bottom of that.' He added: 'I've only heard this news in the past 15 minutes.' Earlier, . Mr Gibson said the family were 'waiting with bated breath' to learn . whether the body is definitely Eddie so they can finally bring him home. He . said: 'On Monday we were phoned by a private investigator who has a . presence in Cambodia and who investigates children who have gone . missing. 'He was notified by . border police at Poipet that there had been some human remains found . near a lake on the border between Cambodia and Thailand, on the Cambodia . side. 'Over the last couple . of days they have secured it as a crime scene, and they have been able . to get more bones, including a skull, and they are assembling the . skeleton.' Eddie was three weeks into a combined Asian and Pacific studies and international management course at Leeds University when he left to travel around Cambodia, pictured . The family believe Eddie may have been murdered on his way back from Phnom Penh in the area where the human remains were found. Mr Gibson said: 'We are waiting with bated breath. For his mother and I, we have had nine and a half years of not knowing. 'We do hope it is Eddie so we can bring him home and bring an end to all this not knowing what has happened to him. 'It's a strange feeling, and if it's not him then it has just relived the whole thing and added to the torture.' Eddie . was three weeks into a combined Asian and Pacific studies and . international management course at Leeds University when he left to . travel around Cambodia. On October 24 2004, he sent his mother Jo an email saying he was 'really looking forward to coming home'. But . the message was the last his family heard from him, and when they went . to meet him off a flight which left Bangkok, Thailand, on November 1, he . was not there. In 2006, . four officers from Sussex Police's major crime branch spent 10 days in . Phnom Penh, working alongside the Cambodian National Police. Interviews . were conducted with people who had contact with Eddie, hotels he stayed . at were visited and officers also travelled to Poipet, but Eddie's . whereabouts remained a mystery. Detective . Chief Inspector Jeff Riley, of Sussex Police, said: 'We are aware of . the finding of human remains in Cambodia that are currently being . examined to see if they could belong to Eddie Gibson. 'We . are continuing to support the Gibson family, as we have since Eddie . went missing, and will help them and the Cambodia authorities through . the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in any way we can to find out what . has happened to him.' A . Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the . reports and our thoughts remain with Eddie Gibson's family. We continue . to be in contact with the family at this difficult time.'","Eddie Gibson disappeared aged 19 in .

The baby gorilla who came down with pneumonia after being born in a rare Caesarean section at the San Diego Zoo has improved enough to begin drinking formula from bottles and to breathe on her own, zoo officials said on Wednesday. The baby gorilla, a girl, was delivered by C-section on March 13 after its 18-year-old mother, Imani, went into labor at the zoo but was unable to complete the delivery, according to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. 'For those who have been following the gorilla closely, you'll notice she's got a lot more hair, and we think that she's really doing well on the formula,' said Nadine Lamberski, associate director of veterinary services at the zoo.

The baby, the 17th gorilla delivered at the Southern California zoo, was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics and other medication until Tuesday. The baby also had a collapsed lung that was reinflated and no longer required supplemental oxygen. 'It's pretty obvious that we've been dealing with pneumonia,' Lamberski said.

"By . Leon Watson . One of the last surviving Lancaster bomber pilots, who was shot down over Germany and taken prisoner by the Nazis in the Second World War, has died aged 91. Dick Starkey was shot down after 22 missions and sent to the infamous Stalag Luft III German prisoner-of-war camp, immortalised by Hollywood in The Great Escape. Mr Starkey returned a few years ago to the 1944 crash site of his beloved Lancaster bomber Queenie and was amazed to be introduced to Martin Becker, the Messerschmitt pilot who shot him down. RAF Lancaster bomber pilot, and one of South Yorkshire's most famous World War Two heroes Richard Starkey of Royston, South Yorkshire, who has died aged 91 . Mr Starkey's bomber Queenie was attacked by a ME110 piloted by Hauptman Martin Becker . Under fire: This painting depicts the attack on Mr Starkey's bomber by Martin Becker in a Messerschmitt during 1944 . They struck up a friendship based on mutal respect, and he swapped Christmas cards with other German fighter pilots who he went on to befriend, he revealed in an interview three years ago. Mr Starkey was also given a hero's welcome by the people of Konigsberg, where his plane crashed on his planned bombing route to Nuremburg. They had salvaged some of wreckage at the time and on his return visit presented him with parts from his old cockpit, which he brought back home. Mr Starkey, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, told his Boy's Own-style story in his autobiography, A Lancaster Pilot's Impression On Germany. He wrote how he helped to stop Adolf Hitler's Nazi march by piloting his way through bullet-riddled skies and out-manoeuvring the Luftwaffe, to drop a total of 200 tons of bombs during the Battle Of Berlin. He was shot down on March 30 during the 1944 Nuremberg Raid - the RAF's bloodiest night, when 700 British airmen were killed. Mr Starkey wrote a book about his experiences having been captured by the Nazis ending up in Stalag Luft III . He was pulled from the crash, which killed every other member of his crew, and ended up in Stalag Luft III, shortly after 50 officers were shot for their failed Great Escape bid in the underground tunnels Tom, Dick and Harry. He was eventually set free and repatriated after German guards feared advancing Russian troops and marched the camp's prisoners for seven days in snow and ice, using them as a human shield. The former Carlton pit office worker said he only became a RAF pilot to give the Nazis some of what he saw them deliver in the blitz over Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Of his own bombing raids, he said: 'I'm sorry for what I did. But I didn't regret it. The two nights I saw the Germans bombing Sheffield made me join up. They started it. 'It was a miracle I survived. When I met the pilot who shot us down there was no animosity. I met others and we were like a flying club. We became friends and swapped all kind of cards.' His incredible story was also documented in Red Line - a book by former Gulf War POW John Nichol, who himself was captured and tortured, by the Iraqis, in 1991. Mr Nichol said: 'Dick and his crew were right at the heart of the action and his story is an astonishing one of courage and sacrifice.' Barnsley-born Mr Starkey, who lived in Pogmoor before moving to Royston 19 years ago, died 'peacefully' in hospital from a stroke after a fall at home, said his family. A widower, following the death of wife Jean, he leaves two daughters, two grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Daughter Denise Heckingbottom, 60, of Royston, said: 'He was a gentleman. People all over the world were still writing to him. We thought he would live forever.' A page from Mr Starkey's pilot's log showing his missions .

"Smalling's fancy dress caper was a beauty . Holloway is a 'Little Englander' By . Patrick Collins . PUBLISHED: . 18:41 EST, 11 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:41 EST, 11 January 2014 . Almost 18 months have passed since Kevin Pietersen uttered that memorably self-pitying remark: 'It's tough being me.' At the time, he was threatening to retire from Test cricket, alienating the bulk of England's cricketers and secretly texting members of the South Africa team with insults aimed at his captain, Andrew Strauss. Before that turbulent August was done, the eminently decent Strauss would retire from the Test arena, Pietersen would be temporarily banished from the England team and English cricket would be in a state of rancorous turmoil. Yet still there were those who defended him; showbiz back-slappers and starstruck flatterers for the most part. Box office: But Kevin Pietersen's powers may be on the wane . 'Genius obeys its own rules,' they told us. 'It's what being KP is all about.' Or, as Pietersen himself portentously put it: 'I am who I am.' At the close of 2012, England's new young captain Alastair Cook would utter this fervent prayer: 'Time, hopefully, will be a healer and we will be able to move on.' Does that situation ring the faintest of bells? Well, it should because poisonous hostility is once more the order of the day and the usual suspect is at its centre. Once again, a senior figure in the England hierarchy has had his fill of our Kev. Another decent man, the coach Andy Flower, apparently finds himself unable to work with his most accomplished player. As ever, the details are obscure. Flower is saying little, while Pietersen is practising his enigmatic shrug, leaving his faithful luvvies to leak their loaded version of events. But as the artless lobbying intensifies, so the bruised and battered English game sinks a little more deeply into the mire. It is as if we had learned nothing from the Strauss Affair, nor from that shameful business of January 2009 when, as England captain, Pietersen attempted a miserably maladroit coup against the England coach Peter Moores, as a result of which Moores was sacked and Pietersen lost a job he should never have been given. Here we should enter the standard caveat. At his best, Pietersen is a batsman of princely command and imagination. His shot-making is gloriously audacious and, when the mood is upon him, he can tailor the game to his own talents. It should also be said that those gifts have not been much in evidence these past few weeks. His faithful supporters protest that he scored more runs than any other England batsmen in the recent series. Dilemma: England may be forced to choose between the civilised eminence of Andy Flower and the simmering selfregard of Kevin Pietersen . Perfectly true but 294 at a pauper's average of 29.40 scarcely suggests wholesale plunder. And the nature of his performances, those distracted dismissals from airy wafts, carried hints of a 33-year-old whose powers may be on the wane. Naturally, the true believers will hear none of this. Why, Michael Vaughan wants him appointed vice-captain, on the grounds that he would flourish with a taste of responsibility. But if the vice-captaincy could work such wonders, then the captaincy itself would surely transform England's fortunes. Recalling Pietersen's previous tenancy, which lasted for precisely three Test matches, I doubt that the experiment will come to pass. In any case, we should do well to remember his history. He flounced out of his native South Africa, following a bogus tiff over the quota system. He incited ructions at Nottinghamshire, which led to captain Jason Gallian hurling his kit from the dressing-room balcony. He made a peremptory departure from Hampshire, having discovered it was a long way from his home in Chelsea: 'Geographically, it doesn't work,' he explained. And his departure from the England captaincy provoked one of the more earthshaking explosions in the long and frequently turbulent history of English cricket. The factor which all these altercations had in common, as his chums will readily testify, is that Pietersen was in no way to blame, he was always an innocent bystander, it was invariably someone else's fault. Just as it is in the present spat with Andy Flower. The ham-fisted propagandists are already at work; we may sacrifice a coach but a genius is irreplaceable; KP is the victim of an Establishment conspiracy; why, I have even seen it suggested that we cannot lose Pietersen as he is 'box office', as if the England team should be selected on television ratings. Well, the saga has run its course. If we really are forced to choose between the civilised eminence of Flower and the simmering selfregard of Pietersen, there is no choice to be made. Pietersen should be directed towards the Indian Premier League, where so much of his fortune has been made, and England should be free to follow a new, saner course. Cook's prayer was admirable, yet misplaced. For where KP is concerned, nobody moves on. They simply hold their breath and await the next eruption. Jagerbomber: Chris Smalling in ill-advised fancy dress outfit . Even by the standards of modern footballers, Chris Smalling's fancy dress caper was a beauty. Hindsight may be easy but did nobody raise an eyebrow when he cried: 'Look, folks! I'm a suicide bomber'? At any rate, it was a real tester for the 'representatives' of the Manchester United defender. And they were magnificently equal to the task. 'He dressed in a costume consisting of empty bottles of Jagermeister and cans of Red Bull strapped to his chest in an attempted comedy play on the popular Jagerbomb drinks,' they explained. It seemed impossible to overhaul Smalling in the terminally tasteless stakes but his hired help brought it off. A man of courage puts football's mob to shame . Two apparently unconnected images offered food for thought in a stormy sporting week. One was of the former Aston Villa player, Thomas Hitzlsperger, relaxed and smiling after announcing that he is gay. The other was of a neanderthal section of Tottenham supporters, faces contorted in mindless fury, screeching abuse at Theo Walcott as he was carried away from the Arsenal pitch with a serious knee injury. Brave decision: Thomas Hitzlsperger . Hitzlsperger, with 52 caps for Germany, retired from the game last September. He says he was warned about the possibility of a hostile reaction to his revelation, so he felt able to come out only when his career was over. The points he makes are thoughtful and revealing. 'The perceived contradiction between playing football, the man's game, and being homosexual is nonsense,' he says. 'You hear the word ""courage"" a lot. That's nice to hear but it's part of the problem, of course. I sincerely hope we'll see the time when nobody mentions courage in these circumstances any more because it will be seen as totally normal that a sportsperson will speak about his homosexuality, the way others talk about their wives and girlfriends.' Injury blow: Theo Walcott was ruled out for the season . Now, only the profoundly uncivilised could disagree with a word of that, which takes us back to that other image, the rabid mob at Emirates. Walcott had merely reminded opposing fans that Arsenal were leading by two goals to nil. Consider what such people - and their kindred spirits up and down the land - might have made of a player who was not only enormously talented but openly gay. The venom which such a man would attract is all too easily imagined. Mercifully, I believe that the tide is turning and that homophobia disgusts the decent majority, who take the view that a footballer's sexuality is of no concern to anybody but himself. Yet the first active player to come out will face problems. At first, he will be reviled by knuckle-draggers around the country. But, ultimately, enlightenment will dawn. It will take patience, determination and something more. It will take courage. While he may not care for the word, it is a quality which Thomas Hitzlsperger possesses in abundance. P.S. Ian Holloway, Millwall's new manager, has always seemed a cheery, uncomplicated fellow. But look closely and you may discern the chip on his shoulder. He explains his failure to succeed in the Premier League with this spot of populist prattle: 'If I had a fair crack, with a budget as good as some, I believe I can do it. But I'm going to have to get there - I'm not one of these foreign fellas who comes in because he has known Jose Mourinho for 10 minutes.' One hesitates to call Holloway, of all people, a 'Little Englander'. But, sadly, the cap seems to fit.","Smalling's fancy dress caper was a beauty .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It has been revealed the former Playboy playmate found dead this week in Los Angeles was binging on drugs and alcohol hours before her death, according to police. Cassandra Lynn Hensley consumed large amounts of cocaine and champagne the night she died, police sources told TMZ. She was found dead in a bath tub the following morning. The woman wasn't feeling well when she landed Tuesday LAX, but went forward with a fitting and a photo shoot before returning to the home of a celebrity photographer she was staying with, the gossip site reported. In her heyday: Cassandra Lynn Hensley, who was found dead on Wednesday, was Miss February 2006 and she is pictured at a Playboy mansion party the following year . Two sides: Just 10 days before her death, Cassandra Lynn posted this photo of her holding up her latest spread . The model and the photographer 'had sex and did large amounts of coke and guzzled lots of champagne,' TMZ reported. They both passed out around 11 p.m., but the photographer awoke a few hours later to find the woman submerged in the bathtub. He was not able to resuscitate her, according to the site. He called police and though the . call has not been released, TMZ reports the friend indicated that it may . have been due to an overdose . First responders were not able to revive Ms Hensley when they arrived at the scene. TMZ first reported the death on Thursday. No foul play is suspected in the woman's tragic death. She . was raised in Ferron, Utah and attended high school where she . reportedly moved around a lot and got into some trouble, prompting her . to be kicked out of several schools. Known best as 'Miss February 2006', Ms . Hensley has continued her modeling career and was most recently named . 'Angel of the Month' by Philadelphia's Metropolis Nights magazine. Overdose: She was found by her friend that she was staying with in Los Angeles and the friend told police that it may have been an overdose . Melding of months: Cassandra (left) is seen at a Playmate party in 2006 alongside fellow models Kara Monaco (center) and Christine Smith (right) 'She was just a nice, outgoing girl who was a little wild,' Aaron Arrington told MailOnline. Mr . Arrington went to the same junior high as Ms Hensley and though they . have been out of touch for some time, he told MailOnline that she had a . somewhat difficult time growing up. 'She was a nice girl but I think she didn't have a really stable childhood,' he said. 'She was a little rowdy.' Eventually she moved into the famed Playboy mansion and was living there around the time that she was made a centerfold. In her . most recent interview, she made it very clear that she is active in the . glamor modeling industry and did not let 2006 career highlight put an . end to her aspirations. Making a name for herself: In recent months, Cassandra Lynn was working as a hostess at events . 'Yes, there is life after Playboy, I have been a part of many great experiences: travel shows, magazine covers, and of course giving advice to young impressionable girls who think they need to act a certain way for a chance to be a model (classy not slutty),' she said to Metropolitian Nights. Cassandra, whose nickname was 'Butterfly' for the five butterfly tattoos she had on her body, had been working in recent months as an event hostess. She recently bought a motorcycle and . had been learning how to ride it in the months leading up to her death, . making her decision to co-headline an autoshow afterparty with a fellow . former playmate in May of last year even more fitting. She did the same for a golf event outside of Washington, D.C. in September. Into her ride: Cassandra Lynn recently bought this motorcycle and updated her Facebook followers about how she was learning how to ride the bike . Home life: She recently dyed her hair dark brown and regularly updated with selfies and pictures with her dog .

'I love Valentine’s Day. And candy. Especially conversation hearts,' she told the site. She was active on social media and had more than 7,800 followers on Twitter. She arranged for her feed to update daily with her horoscope so the latest message posted to her account was set live a day after she was found dead.

An ex-Ohio doctor was sentenced to 36 years in jail on Friday for the rape and involuntary manslaughter of an expectant mother forced into prostitution to support herself and two children. Former ER doctor Ali Salim, 44, pleaded guilty to administering the fatal heroin overdose of Deanna Ballman, 23. Ballman was nine months pregnant with a girl she planned to call Mabel when she died. Delaware County Judge Duncan Whitney . said in sentencing him that the crime in July 2012 was the worst he's ever seen and . that it was unthinkable that as a man of medicine, Salim allowed her to die. Guilty: Ali Salim, right, apologizes for the death of Deanna Ballman with his attorney, Sam Shamansky, left, on Friday in Delaware. Salim, an ex-doctor, was sentenced to 36 years in jail for the involuntary manslaughter and rape of the 23-year-old in 2012 . Tragic: Deanna Ballman, pictured, was nine-months pregnant and had turned to prostitution for extra cash . Behind bars: Ali Salim waits for an elevator to take him back to jail after the sentencing . Salim had faced up to 37 years in . prison. He was given nearly that with a sentence of 36 years and four . months; a few months are likely to be subtracted because of time he's . already served. When victim Ballman disappeared in July 2012, her family initially said she had answered a housekeeping ad on Craigslist. Instead, . investigators determined the 23-year-old woman had taken up . prostitution when she moved back to Ohio after a divorce and with no . financial means. The ad she . responded to: '$200 for a girl in need,' an online euphemism for . prostitution, assistant Delaware County prosecutor Kyle Rohrer said in a . court filing last week. 'That decision unknowingly but ultimately cost her and Mabel their lives,' Rohrer said. Ballman . died of a fatal heroin overdose, which investigators say Salim . administered at his house in an upscale central Ohio neighborhood. Rohrer says there is no evidence Ballman used drugs. Desperate measures: The 23-year-old was said to be in a 'difficult financial situation' after moving home to Ohio from Colorado . A mother's grief: Lori Ballman, mother of slaying victim Deanna Ballman, is sworn in before giving a victim impact testimony at the sentencing of ex-Ohio doctor Ali Salim, far right . In a court filing Thursday, Salim's . attorneys contended that Ballman injected herself with the heroin, but . Whitney rejected that, saying her character had no bearing on the crime. They acknowledged that Salim recorded himself having sex with the incapacitated woman and later moved her body. But they also said Salim met Ballman intending only to have sex, not to hurt her or her unborn child. The . defense said the court should consider Salim's previous background as a . doctor in good standing with no criminal history. They argued he . shouldn't receive the maximum sentence. Salim, . a former emergency room doctor, used Craigslist extensively to meet . sexual partners, with many references in his ads to exchanging drugs for . sex, including heroin, Rohrer said. Many . of the women were young, drug-addicted prostitutes, with several . alleging they were drugged against their will and others saying they . were sexually assaulted, Rohrer's filing said. Salim . also wrote prescriptions for hard drugs for women with whom he had . sexual relationships, and also bought heroin that he gave women who . visited his house. Salim . pleaded guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter in October. He . also pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse. Happy family: Miss Ballman pictured with her two children, was about to give birth to a little girl called Mabel . He . entered a type of guilty plea to a charge of rape under which he . maintained his innocence but acknowledged prosecutors had enough . evidence to convict him. In . its filing, the defense denied the allegations that other women were . drugged and sexually assaulted. Defense attorneys also submitted . Craigslist postings and emails that they say show Ballman solicited sex . online. Salim told . investigators that Ballman was alive when she left the house and he . drove her to a nearby grocery store parking lot where he gave her . directions to get home. Salim . claims he then walked back to his house, according to Rohrer. Ballman's . body was found the next day in the back of her car on a rural road a . few miles from Salim's house. Investigators . say video evidence shows Ballman nude and unconscious on Salim's bed, . apparently suffering distress consistent with a heroin overdose, Rohrer . said. She didn't leave . the house alive, according to the court filing, which said Salim left . to get heroin in a neighboring suburb that evening while Ballman was . still in the house. Rohrer's filing notes that Salim neglected his professional duty to help Ballman. 'Without . regard for mother or child, he dumped their bodies in a remote location . as if he was taking out his trash,' the filing said. Loss: Deanna's mother Lori Ballman holds a tribute to her late daughter, at her home in Pataskala, Ohio . Whitney . has ordered video, audio and photographic evidence destroyed after . criminal and civil cases against Salim end, agreeing with prosecutors . they are obscene and depict acts that Ballman couldn't have consented . to. Salim used Craigslist . extensively to meet sexual partners, with many references in his ads to . exchanging drugs for sex, including heroin, the filing said. Many . of the women were young, drug-addicted prostitutes, with several . alleging they were drugged against their will and others saying they . were sexually assaulted, the filing said. Salim . also wrote prescriptions for hard drugs for women with whom he had . sexual relationships, and bought heroin that he gave women who visited . his house in an upscale neighborhood. A message was left for Salim's attorney, Sam Shamansky, who previously alleged Ballman was a prostitute feeding a drug habit. Ballman, 23, died of a fatal heroin overdose, but there is no evidence she was a drug user, Rohrer said.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Government workers attempted for a second day to block off the World War II Memorial to visitors in Washington due to the shutdown, but a group of veterans returned to the site anyway and blew past the barricades. The veterans, many of whom had also breached the gates on Tuesday, were accompanied this time by Republican senators Claire McCaskill and Roy Blunt, both of Missouri. Reporters on the scene said that just before the veterans arrived, a handful of National Park employees were working to reinforce metal barricades around the memorial. They were also posting signs announcing that the site was off limits due to the government shutdown. Scroll down for video .

Hundreds . of veterans had arrived for a previously scheduled visit to the . memorial Tuesday morning to find it barricaded by the National Park . Service after the shutdown went into effect at midnight. But the group of vets who had traveled from Mississippi were not to be deterred and 'stormed' into the memorial. Members . of Congress, including Republican Reps. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, . and Steven Palazzo, of Mississippi, rushed to the site after receiving . panicked emails and cut police tape to let in the veterans.

Tough guys: Many of the veterans at the site were wheelchair-bound or relying on walking canes to get around . On the fence: U.S. Park Police close off the World War II Memorial in Washington after the first  government shutdown in 17 years went into effect . A long-running dispute between Democrats . and Republicans over President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act . stalled a temporary funding bill, forcing about 800,000 federal workers . off the job and suspending most non-essential federal programs and . services. ‘We’re looking about how to deal with this in the future,’ Johnson said. Leo Shane III, a reporter for the newspaper Stars and Stripes who was present at the memorial, tweeted that he witnessed Rep Steve King, of Iowa, distracting a Park Service officer while veterans knocked down the barricades. Members of The Mississippi Gulf Honor Flight - a nonprofit group that arranges free visits to the WWII Memorial for veterans - made their way to the capital visit the memorial. Wayne Lennep, a spokesman for the organization, said they had planned the visit long before the shutdown and could not cancel the pilgrimage to the memorial. Keeping history locked up: One of the clearest examples of the effect of the shutdown comes from the closure of all National Parks . The 91 veterans, many of them wheelchair-bound or using walking canes to get around, arrived at Reagan National Airport in an $80,000 chartered plane Tuesday morning. They boarded buses and arrived at the . memorial at around 11.30am, only to discover metal fences around the . site and printed signs announcing that the memorial has been closed due . to the government shutdown. Even . though park police officers were patrolling the area, they made no . attempts to stop the veterans and congressmen who came to their aid from . moving the barriers and entering the site. ‘I thought I was going to have to stand back when we first got here,’ veteran Robert Meredith told The Epoch Times. ‘I feel extremely lucky. This is really nice, a great honor.’ Fighting back: Protestors demonstrated by the Capitol demanding the House pass a Continuing Resolution without any amendments that attempted to defund the Affordable Care Act . Defending themselves: Republicans, lead by Senator David Vitter at the podium, called for Democrats to compromise and allow them to pass a version of a budget to end the shutdown . Sticking on message: Democratic House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi pushed for Americans to enroll in the national healthcare system that was launched today . The gray-haired and stooped visitors were able to lay a wreath at the Mississippi pillar and take pictures before leaving the site less than an hour later. Besides the travelers from Mississippi, a group of veterans from Iowa dressed in bright yellow shirts were also allowed to access the memorial. At the Korean War Memorial, a group of veterans from Puerto Rico also stormed the barricades to lay a wreath, The Washington Post reported. Major hurdles: Park rangers erect barricades as a visitor is turned away from a section of Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia . Rep. Bill Huizenga, of Michigan, called the veterans’ bold actions ‘the best civil disobedience we've seen in Washington in a while,’ according to The Gulf Live. The veterans’ decision to ignore the shutdown and move fences aside in order to pay their respects to military heroes has drawn bipartisan support from members of the House and Senate alike. Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, posted on Twitter that he would be donating his pay during the shutdown to the Honor Flight organization in his home state, while Republican Sen. John McCain, of Arizona, simply tweeted, ‘Good for them.’","Veterans stormed the gates of the WWII Memorial again on Wednesday .

The Reverend, who presided over the bank's near collapse, told friends he blamed the death of his mother and the pressure of his top banking job for turning to cocaine and rent boys. Flowers - who has since been dubbed the Crystal Methodist - also claimed he was the victim of a 'nasty sting' and a 'witch-hunt'. Scroll down for video . 'Victim': The Rev Paul Flowers breaks cover to appear in public at a cinema in Liverpool . The 63-year-old's Labour-supporting lawyer Andy Hollas told The Sun: 'He feels he has been the victim of a rather nasty sting operation. 'He's been emotionally vulnerable for some 18 months - since the death of his mother, Muriel. He's a very moral man and he feels let down by the people he trusted.' Flowers' mother died of cancer and he is said to have claimed to have cared for her while buckling under the pressure of his top banking job. His defence was revealed as further sex and drugs allegations emerged against the former Bradford councillor.

Jamelyn Steenhoek, 39, . says she was violated by TSA screeners while dropping her 13-year-old . daughter at the gate for her Dec 26 flight – the subsequent friskings from TSA . agents felt like a medical exam, she said. The Denver Police . Department is now investigating her claims after she filed a police report, . according to CBS Denver. Scroll down to video . Claims of sex assault: Jamelyn Steenhoef claims frisky TSA agents sexually assaulted her during security searches as thorough as a medical exam . ‘We take all complaints seriously . and we are on this case,’ a police spokesperson told the station. ‘We have . launched an investigation into it.’ Ms Steenhoek said in an . interview with the station that she was escorting her daughter to the . Philadelphia-bound flight’s gate when TSA inspectors were alerted by an alarm . going off at the security checkpoint. She says the said her . jeans must have been at fault, they had studs on the back pockets, an agent then conducted . an explosives swab on her hands. ‘Then they told me I . tested positive for explosives,’ she recalled, saying that she told . screeners she pumped gas earlier that day and it must have triggered the . positive result. She said, ‘We’ll have to . do a search.’ So I thought, ‘Okay,’ said Ms Steenhoek. Checkpoint: The long lines at Denver International Airport as people wait to go through security .

On the outside of my pants she . cupped my crotch. I was uncomfortable with that. ‘The part of the search . that bothered most was the breast search. You could tell it shouldn’t take that . much groping. To me it was as extensive as an exam from my physician — full . touching and grabbing in the front. I felt uncomfortable, I felt violated.’ The agent found nothing – . so they took her to a second room and did the search again. ‘The whole search was done . over and more touching and grabbing than the first time,’ said the distraught . woman.

"By . Rob Cooper . When Grenadier Guard Ronald Skinner returned home from the Second World War battlefield he never told his family about the horrors he witnessed. The veteran, who signed up for the army in 1934, saw action in North Africa as British troops pushed up to take Italy. The former serviceman died in 1974 aged 56 and his son Steve, then 32, thought he would never know what his father experienced on the frontline. War memories: Steve Skinner, 71, with a suitcase full of his father's belongings. He inherited the case in 2005 but did not look inside until recently . But Mr Skinner, now 71, has now found his father's wartime diaries buried in an old box of belongings he had stashed in the attic. Ronald left all his belongings with his widow Gladys when he died. His son inherited the suitcase when she died in 2005 at the age of 84. Steve put it in his loft without looking . inside but opened it recently and was astonished to find the diaries and . see that his father had written poems. He discovered that although his father escaped the conflict uninjured he did badly cut his . hand when chopping up an apple and had to have stitches without . anaesthetic. Mr Skinner Snr fought in many hill battles and the Battle of Monte Cassino in Rome in 1944. War veteran: Grenadier Guard Ronald Skinner (right) is seen sat here with an army colleague. His son Steve recently unearthed his wartime diaries . War: Ronald Skinner (front centre) saw action in North Africa during World War II but never discussed his battlefield experiences in any great detail . Among his diary entries he wrote: 'What a night. Heavy shelling and gunfire. 'Our guns answered. Like hell. You can't sleep at night here. Wet and snow - a few killed and several wounded. 'I swear now no son or sons of mine will ever go to war under any circumstances whatsoever.' Another diary entry said: 'Fair day, terrible night. Shelling far too close - lucky to escape.' Steve also found a poignant poem by his father who had enlisted at the age of 17 in 1934, entitled 'Why do the weak men have to fight'. Servicemen: An old photo of the Grenadier Guards from Ronald Skinner's files. Mr Skinner is sat in the front row on the far left of this photo . Steve, a retired blind fitter from Sudbury, Suffolk, said: 'The people who go to war are not the people who make war. My father was not ""gung ho"". Among his diary entries Mr Skinner wrote: 'What a night. Heavy shelling and gunfire. 'Our guns answered. Like hell. You can't sleep at night here. Wet and snow - a few killed and several wounded. 'I swear now no son or sons of mine will ever go to war under any circumstances whatsoever.' Another diary entry said: 'Fair day, terrible night. Shelling far too close - lucky to escape.' 'He tried to normalise his experience by writing. It was a way of hanging on to his sanity. 'They did not know when they were going to die. When they went to sleep they would think it could be their last before the big sleep. 'I used to listen to tales about what happened in the war and they just seemed like stories to us. 'Reading what dad wrote gives us an insight into what he went through and it makes me very proud. 'He admitted to me that he was scared and extremely lucky. He suffered from shell shock, but he never made a fuss of it.' Mr Skinner signed up with the Grenadier Guards in 1934 and served at Windsor Castle before being called to war. He married his wife Gladys in 1939 and Steve, their first child, was born in 1942 but was not properly seen by his father until he return from war in 1945. Steve, who lives with his wife Ruth, 67, added: 'The poems dad wrote expressed what life was like in the trenches being bombarded with enemy fire. Wartime note: A letter written by Mr Skinner to his wife. He signs off saying he hopes all is well back home 'love from your devoted husband' 'To people who have seen this portrayed in films, it doesn't seem real. 'But when it's your father's first-hand accounts in his own handwriting - and some of it quite shaky - it brings home the reality of it all. 'It's an important part of our family history but it's also a first hand account of the circumstances soldiers found themselves in. 'It's a significant part of the country's history too.' Steve now hopes to publish his father's poetry in a book to raise money for Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.

"By . Mark Duell . It seems a free upgrade will no longer be the preserve of the well-connected, bolshy or randomly lucky airline traveller. Various airlines are now launching online upgrade auctions that allow passengers with economy tickets to take part in a blind bid for available business class seats in advance of their flight. Austrian Airlines followed Air New Zealand, El Al of Israel, Etihad of Abu Dhabi and Virgin Atlantic in becoming the latest carrier last week to start auctioning upper-class seats to economy passengers. Upgrade: Passengers with economy tickets are allowed on some flights to take part in a blind bid for available business class seats in advance of their flight . Upper crust: The business model works for carries trying to generate extra revenue on seats that would otherwise be unused, while trying to avoid reducing earnings from business travellers already paying full fare . Luxury: On a flight where empty business class seats are expected, a passenger booking in economy will be offered an upgrade - but airlines refuse to state the average winning bid . Plusgrade has developed technology to . enable the blind bidding - and the U.S. software developer which is . based in New York claimed it is speaking to several other airlines about . working with them. The company's chief executive Ken Harris said: 'The concept came . from the fact that if a flight leaves from London to New York right now and . no-one is sitting in seat 2A, that seat would be lost forever. He told MailOnline: ‘We're definitely seeing a lot of rapid . adoption by more and more airlines.’ Mr Harris went on to say that the idea should not put off . business travellers from buying luxury seats upfront because . ‘you're going to want that peace of mind that you're sitting in the upper level'. He added that Plusgrade is working on a project with . El Al, ‘where you can bid for an extra seat next to you - a . neighbour-free guarantee’. Mr Harris said: ‘Anyone who's flown in economy is really hoping that they're . the lucky one. They could ensure that by paying a nominal . fee.’ The . business model works for carries trying to generate extra revenue on . seats that would otherwise be unused, while trying to avoid reducing . earnings from business travellers already paying full fare. Sitting back: Former Virgin Atlantic chief executive Steve Ridgway tries the first-class seats in the Dreamliner 787. Virgin is one of the airlines offering customers the chance to win an upgrade through an auction . Relaxation: Airlines are concerned that revealing successful bids would set a 'price list' that may result in current business-class passengers switching to economy, and then attempting to bid for a better seat . Help: Air New Zealand auctions see a colour code signalling how likely a bid for an upgrade is to succeed . On . a flight where empty business class seats are expected, a passenger . booking in economy will be offered an upgrade - but airlines refuse to . state the average winning bid.

Only some passengers who currently have economy seats are invited to take part in the auction, with a ‘host of internally-prioritised goals’ deciding who is eligible, according to Plusgrade. Auctions by Air New Zealand see bids placed at least a week before departure, and its website suggests that an upgrade from economy to premium economy on a London Heathrow to Auckland flight could cost around £550 through an auction.

The relatives of one of the seven friends who were piled into a wealthy drunk driver’s pickup truck have spoken out about the ‘living hell’ they have been in since the accident six months ago. Sergio Molina was in the back of a pickup truck being driven erratically by Ethan Couch when he slammed into four people on the side of a road. Those four people- a young woman whose car had broken down, a Good Samaritan trying to help, and a mother and daughter who also got out to see what they could do- were all killed. Sergio, who is now 16, is still alive but has a completely different existence than he did before the accident as he is paralyzed, ‘minimally conscious’ and needs constant medical attention. Forever changed: Sergio Molina, now 16, was in a coma following the June accident but now has been transferred home as his family grapples with how to adjust to his now-permanent paralysis . Heartbreaking: Sergio now must be cared for by his mother Maria Lemus (left) and older brother Alex (right) around the clock and they have already accrued $1million in medical bills . Expensive: Alex Lemus (left) had to quit his job to help care for his brother and the family has already accrued more than a million dollars in medical bills over the past six months . Speaking to CNN, Sergio’s older brother Alex Lemus said that doctors warned them of getting their hopes too high. ‘That’s all we can hope for, is how he is now for the rest of his life,’ Lemus said. He attended Couch’s trial in place of his brother, who can barely move without assistance. When the judge handed down a sentence of 10 years’ probation and no jail time for the crash, Lemus said that he had trouble processing his anger. He said he was ‘disappointed, so outrageously angry that I couldn’t say anything’. His mother, Maria Lemus, still breaks down in tears when thinking about all of Sergio’s dreams that seem so far out of reach in light of the accident. No jail: Ethan Couch of Keller, Texas, is being sent to the $450k per year rehab center as part of punishment . Drunk: Couch's blood alcohol reading was .24 and he also had a Valium in his system when he killed four people and injured several more on June 15 . ‘He was the best son, he was the kind of boy who had a lot of dreams,’ Ms Lemus said. ‘He was his first dream was to be a soccer player. He was sweet.’ Sergio’s family estimates that they have accrued more than $1million in medical bills over the past six months, and they are now suing Couch’s family and his father’s business- the car that the boys were in was owned by the company- for up to $20million. Before: Sergio had dreams of playing professional soccer before the accident . ‘That kid killed four people and crippled my little brother and doesn’t even have to serve one year? If he were poor like us, he would’ve gotten 10 years, I bet,’ Alex Lemus told The Dallas Morning News. They are not the first victims relatives to speak out in light of the controversial ruling, as Eric Boyles, who lost his wife Hollie and 21-year-old daughter Shelby in the accident said he is dissatisfied with the easy sentence, and thinks Couch should have been tried as an adult. Since he was tried as a juvenile, Couch faced a maximum of 20 years in prison but would have been eligible for parole after 2 years. 'You look at 180 years of future life taken from the four individuals...Even a two year deal, a two year sentence before he's eligible for parole, didn't seem exactly fair under those circumstances,' Mr Boyle said. Additionally upsetting to Mr Boyle is the fact that Couch will receive his counseling at a 'country club'-style treatment center- with a pricetag of $450,000 per year and features equine therapy and organic menu options- in ritzy Newport Beach, California. The fatal accident occurred around 11:45om on June 15, Couch and a group his friends who were all drunk, got into a red Ford F350 pick-up and were speeding 70 mph in a 40 mph zone when the truck left the road. As it careered out of control, it clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four good Samaritans, who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air. Youth pastor Brian Jennings, mother and daughter Hollie and Shelby Boyles and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell were all killed on impact. It was revealed soon after that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in their system - and that he was also on the prescription drug Valium when he started the chain reaction of crashes. The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported. Speaking out: Eric Boyles, the father and husband of two women killed in a June drunk driving accident, isn't pleased that the teen driver got off with just a 10 year probation sentence . Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup . Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash . A psychologist called by the defense, Dr Gary Miller, blamed the teen's behavior on his parents, claiming they gave him whatever he wanted including 'freedoms no young person should have'. Dr Miller called Couch a product of 'affluenza,' where his family felt their wealth bought privilege and there was no rational link between behavior and consequences. He added that the boy had an 'intellectual age' of 18 but an 'emotional age' of 12. 'The teen never learned to say that you’re sorry if you hurt someone,' Dr Miller said, according to the Star Telegram. 'If you hurt someone, you sent him money.' State District Judge Jean Boyd appeared to agree with the defense. She told the teen that he is responsible for what happened, but she said she didn't believe he would receive the therapy he needed in jail. If he violates the terms of his probation, he could be sent to prison for 10 years. Defense attorneys asked that he be sent to a private rehabilitation home near Newport Beach, California, which costs an enormous $450,000 a year. His father said he'd foot the bill.

They were both riding in Couch's truck when the cash occured . Prosecutors said the juvenile justice system also offered counseling. Breanna's mother, Marla Mitchell, said she was 'mad' about the sentence and embraced the families of the other victims outside of the courtroom. 'He'll be feeling the hand of God, definitely,' she told WFAA.com. 'He may think he got away with something, but he hasn't gotten away with anything.'","Ethan Couch, 16, faced 20 years behind bars for killing four people in a car crash but walked away with 10 years probation Tuesday .

"By . Daniel Miller . A French soldier has sparked outrage after being pictured wearing a grinning skeleton facemask like one featured in the ultra-violent computer game Call of Duty while serving in Mali. Military authorities have launched an investigation to discover the soldier's identity after he was photographed using the mask, also known as a death's head, to protect himself from dust kicked up by a helicopter. The trooper is one of an estimated 2,000 French soldiers sent to the west African nation to fight hardline Islamic extremists who seized control last year.

The skeleton mask features prominently in the Call of Duty where it is worn by the character Ghost an SAS soldier . Photographer Issouf Sanogo from Agence France Press described the moment the picture was taken on a blog. 'A helicopter was coming in to land and . churning up tremendous dust clouds. Instinctively, all the soldiers . grabbed their scarfs to avoid getting a mouthful of sand,' he wrote. 'I saw the soldier wearing an odd bandana and I took the photo. At the moment I didn’t find it particularly extraordinary or shocking. The soldier wasn’t posing.' 'I don’t know who the soldier is, and I would have trouble recognizing him if I saw him again. I believe, and I hope, that it will be impossible to identify him.' Although popularised by Call of Duty, pictures of U.S. service personel wearing the masks are common and one was worn by Actor Christin Bale in the 2005 film Harsh Times. Yesterday Britain's Prince Harry was widely criticised for suggesting he was 'probably quite useful' as a helicopter gunner because he played computer games.

French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said today that the goal of France's military action in Mali was to retake control of the entire country from Islamist militants who have seized the north . Security experts have long expressed concern about the weakness of Mali's military and its inability to contribute forcefully in the international intervention against the Islamist extremists, who are well-armed and determined fighters. When a Tuareg rebellion erupted in northern Mali more than a year ago, Malian soldiers complained that those sent to fight in the harsh desert environment were not given sufficient supplies, including arms and food. The fighting claimed the lives of numerous soldiers. Then, after the military coup in March . 2012, the Malian army gave little to no resistance as the Islamists . seized the major cities of northern. After . holding northern Mali for several months, the Islamists went on the . offensive again and seized the central Malian town of Diabaly on Jan. 14. But this time the . French military was in Mali and began airstrikes later that evening. Residents say the Islamists fled the town later in the week.

Malian soldiers would not have been able to recapture the city without . French help, according to many residents, including Modibo Sawadogo. 'We . are happy about the presence of (foreign) soldiers who can reassure us . because without them our military wouldn't be able to return,' he said. However, Modibo Traore, a Malian army . spokesman, asserted that the military is prepared for the challenge and . will be aided by forces coming from Mali's neighbors. 'At . each retaken city there will be African units who will be supporting . the military in securing the city,"" he said. ""At the same time, other . soldiers are advancing to recapture other towns."" Military experts say that the Malian army is a weak partner. The . Mali army is not up to the task of holding control of the country's . cities on its own. It needs the French and the support of a big African . force,' said David Zounmenou, senior researcher for the Institute for . Security Studies in Pretoria, South Africa. 'It's . extremely risky to rely on the Malian army. This African-led support . mission - that will certainly be the backbone of the military presence . that will take over for France. Even then French air support will be . needed.' The Mali army is . weak for a number of reasons. After Mali suffered coups in 1968 and . 1991, the government wanted to reduce the army's influence and to . strengthen democracy, so the defense budget was reduced and its . equipment became outdated, said Zounmenou.

A Malian boy sweeps his donkey drawn cart in the early hours of the morning in the town of Markala . The Mali army became filled with people who were friends of the regime and seeking jobs, he said. 'The military coup in March 2012 was by mid-ranking officers, led by Capt. Amadou Sanogo, who destroyed the command structure of the army. Many top officers of the army are still in jail,' said Zounmenou. 'The army is faced with considerable internal problems. It adds up to a situation in which the army is not well-trained or disciplined. It is ill-equipped for the current fight to regain northern Mali from the committed Islamist fighters.' Yet the Malian army now has the responsibility of holding the centers that have been retaken by the French. In Diabaly, after securing the town, the French military took off just as quickly as they arrived, leaving only the Malians late Monday in a column of at least seven armored vehicles along with journalists. The Malians are again alone - and in charge of Diabaly. Some residents, though, wonder how safe they, in fact, are.

"By . Lee Moran . A computer hacker who admitted accessing Scarlett Johansson's email account and leaking nude photographs of her online faces up to 60 years in prison and a $2.2million fine. Jobless Christopher Chaney, 35, also pleaded guilty yesterday to nine other counts - including the hacking into the email accounts of singer Christina Aguilera and actress Mila Kunis. Chaney, of Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested in October as part of a year-long investigation of celebrity hacking that authorities dubbed 'Operation Hackerazzi'. Guilty: Christopher Chaney (left) admitted hacking into the email of Scarlett Johansson (right) and leaking nude photos of her onto the internet. He know faces up to 60 years in prison and a $2.2million fine . Laid bare: Scarlett Johansson, pictured in this D&G advert, said the nude photos of her that Chaney accessed were intended for her now ex-husband Ryan Reynolds . Prosecutors said he illegally accessed the email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. Nude photos Johansson had taken of herself were later posted on the internet. Johansson told Vanity Fair in its December issue that the photos were meant for Ryan Reynolds, now her ex-husband. Chaney mined through publicly available data to figure out password and security questions for celebrity accounts. Once he had control of their email account, he also went through their contact lists to find email accounts of fellow stars. He also hijacked a forwarding feature so a copy of every email a celebrity received was sent to an account he controlled, according to court documents. A search warrant said Chaney's computer hard drive contained numerous private celebrity photos and a document that compiled their extensive personal data. Victims: Mila Kunis (left) and Christina Aguilera (right) were also hacked by the jobless criminal . In one instance, Chaney posed as stylist Simone Harouche and sent an email from her account to Aguilera - one of Harouche's clients - asking the singer for scantily clad photographs, prosecutors said. Some of Aguilera's photos appeared online. Chaney forwarded many of the photographs to two gossip websites and another hacker, but there was not any evidence that he profited from his scheme, authorities said. He has since apologised for his actions. In ordering Chaney to be behind bars until he is sentenced on July 23, U.S. District Judge S James Otero noted the defendant continued to hack into celebrity email accounts - namely one belonging to a star only referenced by initials C.B. - after he was interviewed by FBI agents and confessed to his scheme. 'I don't understand why any person who is rational would continue in that kind of behaviour,' Otero opined. As part of the plea agreement, Chaney could pay a fine of up to $2.2million. He must pay restitution to his victims, ranging from $15,000 to $400,000. It is unclear whether Aguilera, Kunis or Johansson would write letters to the judge or attend Chaney's sentencing. But all three women agreed to have their identities made public after an indictment was announced last October. Aguilera's publicist Nicole Perez-Krueger declined comment. Messages left for representatives of Kunis and Johansson were not immediately returned. ESPN reporter Erin Andrews attended the Los Angeles sentencing of insurance executive Michael Barrett in March 2010 after he pleaded guilty to interstate stalking. He secretly shot nude videos of her through hotel peepholes. Andrews urged for a harsh sentence, but Barrett agreed to serve a 27-month term.","Jobless Christopher Chaney, 35, pleads guilty to nine charges of hacking .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC's female children’s TV presenters are banned from wearing red lipstick or looking ‘too sexy’ on air, a senior editor says. Hosts including former Blue Peter star Helen Skelton and CBBC presenter Dionne Bromfield have been told they must be ‘fantastic female role models’ and avoid dressing in provocative outfits. Melissa Hardinge – who is an executive editor at the corporation’s children’s channel CBBC – said programme makers are careful to protect young viewers from sexualised imagery and bad language. Scroll down for video . Hosts including former Blue Peter star Helen Skelton and CBBC presenter Dionne Bromfield have been told they must be 'fantastic female role models' Talking at a Bafta panel event on the future of children’s television, she revealed she takes swearing guidelines so carefully she once spent 20 minutes discussing the word ‘fart’. She said: ‘Obviously sexualisation of girls is something we take incredibly seriously. We try and show fantastic female role models. ‘I go onto the floor of Friday Download and make them take their red lipstick off, the presenters. ‘The older end of our six to twelve age groups are very interested in relationships, and we have to show positive role models and the correct way of going about having relationships.’ Friday Download's presenter Shannon Flynn is not allowed to wear red lipstick . Featuring a mixture of pop music, film news and style advice, Friday Download is an hour-long weekly show that features a panel of hosts including singer Miss Bromfield and actress Shannon Flynn, both 17. When asked whether the BBC pays attention to what female presenters wear, Mrs Hardinge said: ‘We take that very seriously. 'We know that a lot of young girls will look at how our presenters are dressed, and no they shouldn’t look too sexy.’ She also discussed new film classifications introduced by the British board of Film Classification, which promised it would crack down on bad language and violence in U-rated films earlier this month. ‘The problem is that certain words in some families are fine, and some are not. ‘I have sat in editorial forums at the BBC where we have spent 20 minutes talking about whether the word ‘fart’ is acceptable or not. It depends on the context and whether you can use a euphemism.’ She added: ‘The portrayal of violence is a very, very sensitive thing. We have very strict editorial guidelines to try and steer the right course. ‘For anything that can be easily copied using a domestic implement, for example, we have to take our responsibility as a public service broadcaster very seriously and find the lines.’ Eric Huang, development director at digital media company Made in Me, told the audience he recalled seeing Bugs Bunny shooting Elmer Fudd repeatedly in the face as a child, in a ‘casual portrayal of violence’. He added: ‘It was OK then, but not now. Some of it is determined by fashion and what we think is ok today.’","Former Blue Peter star Helen Skelton and CBBC presenter Dionne Bromfield have been told they must be 'fantastic female role models'

"PUBLISHED: . 01:37 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 01:48 EST, 13 January 2014 . It was branded the unsinkable ship that had every luxury imaginable available to its wealthy passengers. But the billionaire who is rebuilding the Titanic today chose not to boast of the lavish facilities for the privileged few who will travel first class. Instead, Clive Palmer said that he was considering marketing third class tickets as an adventure holiday - complete with limited menus, cramped bunks and delousing on arrival in New York. Cramped: A replica of a third class cabin on the Titanic where four people slept in very close proximity. Washing facilities can be seen inbetween the bunks . Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, in 1997 film, Titanic, seen dancing a jig on tables in third class with band playing in the background (left) and a medical examination of newly arrived immigrants on Ellis Island, New York, in 1911 (right). Third class passengers on Titanic II are unlikely to be subjected to such scrutiny but Mr Palmer said he might hose them in confetti to recreate the experience of delousing . ‘First class on the Titanic was truly unbelievable, second class was like our first class and third class - well third class was really third class’, he told news.com.au. 'The Titanic original design had an area under the water line two decks high and 40ft (12m) long simply marked ""potatoes.''' Period clothing will be provided to guests who wish to dress up for the voyage as there will be no access to television or the internet for entertainment on the 40,000 tonne ship. Passengers may also be treated to Irish jigs and delousing upon arrival in New York though Mr Palmer conceded that they may simply be sprayed with a hose of confetti. 'We might offer to recreate the experience of those hopeful immigrants to America, he said. The original Titanic struck an iceberg on the night of April 14, 1912, while on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York with the loss of 1,517 lives. Many could have been saved if the ship had had adequate numbers of lifeboats. Sequel: An artist's rendering of Australian billionaire, Clive Palmer's proposed cruise ship Titanic II, not scheduled to set sail until 2017 . Original: The Titanic leaving Southampton on her ill-fated maiden voyage on April 10, 1912 . Recreating the Titanic down to every last detail is set to cost the former mining magnate, who is now MP for Fairfax, Queensland, an estimated $175million (£105million, $197 Aus). Titanic II is set to make its maiden voyage in 2017, will include air conditioning, a hospital, a helipad - and the appropriate number of lifeboats which were so tragically missing from the original. The liner is being built by CSC Jinling Shipyard Company in China. Like the original, there will be room for 2,500 passengers. Both first and third class will have around 1,000 spaces with room for 500 people in second. It is unclear if Mr Palmer will strictly adhere to the original blueprints for third class passengers in his new ship. Conditions in cabins are likely to be cramped but whether modern tourists will put up with 1912 washing arrangements is debatable. The first Titanic offered personal washbasins for its poorest travellers but only two bathtubs to service the entire class. The designer of the new ship Markku Kanerva claimed at a press conference last year that it would be the 'most safe cruise ship in the world' with ample lifeboats. He said that it had more than enough lifeboats and that the hull was stronger than the wooden original because it was made from steel composite. However, Mr Palmer refused to claim it was 'unsinkable' and instead said: 'I think anything will sink if you put a hole in it. I think you'd be very cavalier to say something like that. 'I think people in the past have done that and lived to regret it.' The blueprint for the Titanic II was unveiled in New York last year along with computer generated images of the inside.

They bear a startling resemblance to the 1997 James Cameron film about the ship, which starred Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio, and show that many of the original features including the famous Grand Staircase will feature in the new boat. The six-day maiden voyage will take place in 2017 and will be be from Southampton to New York to 'complete the journey' started all those years ago. Just like in 1912 there will be three classes of passenger and those with different tickets will not be able to move between the classes. Professor Palmer outlined his bold . vision in which the Titanic II would be 'carrying the hopes and dreams . of people everywhere' and represent 'the reconciliation of man'.

It will have a tonnage of 55,800 tonnes compared to 53,210 of the original. It will have a maximum speed of 24 knots, the same as the first Titanic.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . A landmark budget agreement that passed in the U.S. House on Thursday faces certain death in the Senate unless at least five Republicans step up to support it – but so far there are no takers at all. The GOP's Senate leaders plan to launch a procedural effort to kill the plan over a laundry list of objections – including a claim that it short-changes military veterans and other government retirees. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin conceded that he needs to find Republicans who will vote for the measure after Republicans announced their intention Thursday night to block the deal. 'We need Republican votes to pass the budget agreement, period,' Durbin told reporters on Thursday. 'We need at least five. And I’m hoping that there will be more than that.' Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and the third-most powerful Senate leader, acknowledged that 'there are not five Republicans who have announced they’re for it.' In fact, no Republican senators have publicly said that they will vote in favor of the agreement that Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray unveiled Tuesday evening. Turtle in the headlights? Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is on the hot seat as his caucus prepares to fight against the budget agreement that the House passed easily Thursday night . No way, Jose: Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative tea-party darling, said the budget proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare. I cannot support it' Their plan would roll back . $63 billion in mandatory cuts from the so-called budget sequester that took effect in March. Some of that restored spending . would be offset by cuts to military and civilian government pensions. Annual cost-of-living increases in most military veterans' retirement benefits would be cut by 1 per cent, an amount that the Military Officers Association of America says could cost a typical former soldier or sailor $80,000 over a 20-year period. The GOP's three most senior senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have announced that they will vote 'no.' Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, all considered top-tier presidential contenders in 2016, are all lined up against the measure. The proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare,' Cruz said Thursday. 'I cannot support it.' Gang of two: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray negotiated a shutdown-averting agreement that could be headed nowhere . Rubio emailed supporters on Wednesday, saying that the agreement Ryan and Murray negotiated over a six-week period 'continues Washington's irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in and placing additional financial burdens on everyday Americans.' House Speaker John Boehner fanned the flames of a civil war inside the GOP by slamming conservative groups that opposed the budget deal -- but it could all be for nought if his Senate colleagues decide to kill it . And Paul said in a statement that the March sequester cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem. Undoing tens of billions of this modest spending restraint is shameful and must be opposed.' Other Republicans who face primary challenges from tea party-backed candidates are also vowing to cast 'no' votes. 'After careful review of the agreement, I believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees,' South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement. 'Our men and women in uniform have served admirably during some of our nation’s most troubling times. They deserve more from us in their retirement than this agreement provides.' Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, echoed Graham's complaint. 'I do not support paying for increased federal spending on the backs of our retired and active duty troops,' Wicker's Thursday statement read. 'Congress should not change the rules in the middle of the game for those who have chosen to serve our nation in the military. ... The plan should be rejected.' Other Republicans object to what one GOP Senate staffer told MailOnline is the agreement's 'pixie dust approach to budgeting.' 'We're doing what we always do,' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'We set out a ten-year plan while knowing full well that we have a decade to undo it and shift gears again.' Looking toward 2016: Sen. Rand Paul said the unpopular 'sequester' budget cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem' and should never be rolled back . Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions explained that Democrats will need 60 'yes' votes – on two separate procedural ballots – in order to pass it. The GOP's parliamentary roadblocks will have the same effect as a traditional filibuster without consuming countless hours of Senate time when the measure is considered early next week. Even if Senate Democrats manage to find enough Republican support to pass the agreement, it won't have the force of law. What Ryan and Murray proposed Wednesday is merely a framework for a budget that has yet to be written. Members of Congress who sit on appropriation committees will still be required to craft – and pass in both houses – a final budget bill by January 15. Unless they can pull it off, the federal government will be headed for its second shutdown in three months.","Congress needs to pass a new budget by January 15 to avoid another government shutdown .

"By . James Chapman . Ministers reacted with fury last night after controversial UN inspector Raquel Rolnik produced a 'misleading Marxist diatribe' condemning the Government's flagship welfare and housing policies. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith described the Brazilian's report – which criticises the so-called 'bedroom tax' and demands better housing for travellers – as 'utterly ridiculous'. And Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said: 'This partisan report is completely discredited, and it is disappointing that the United Nations has allowed itself to be associated with a misleading Marxist diatribe.' Anger: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (left) reacted with fury after UN inspector Raquel Rolnik (right) issued what he called an 'utterly ridiculous' report . Miss Rolnik visited Britain last year as the UN's 'special rapporteur' on housing, prompting a storm of controversy. At . the end of her trip she voiced concern about housing benefit cuts, . saying that she was 'shocked to hear how many people feel abused in . their human rights'. The UN . claimed that she had taken advantage of a standing invitation to its . inspectors to visit and assess the impact of policies in member states. Conservative . MP Stewart Jackson branded Miss Rolnik a 'loopy Brazilian Leftie with . no evidence' who was 'masquerading as a serious UN official'. And . critics suggested that she look a bit closer to home – pointing out . that in Brazil, where she was a housing minister, tens of millions of . people are condemned to living in shanty towns or favelas. It . also emerged that Miss Rolnik had been an avid follower of Candomble, . an African-Brazilian religion that originated during the slave trade.

Yesterday . the UN's high commission for human rights, which is responsible for . Miss Rolnik, insisted that it had no knowledge of her final report. In . the document, Miss Rolnik complains about the 'lack of appropriate and . culturally adequate residential and transit accommodation' for . travellers. She also . expresses concern about cuts to council tax benefit, the housing benefit . cap and the 'bedroom tax' which will see working-age claimants with . more bedrooms than they require get their handouts reduced. The . Government, which estimates that the average affected household will . lose £14 a week, says the policy will save taxpayers £500million a year. Colourful background: Academic Miss Rolnik, brought up a Marxist, offered an animal sacrifice to Karl Marx (pictured) when she was studying for her master's degree in architecture, according to her sister .

Rolnik admitted that 'in principle the policy does not force people to . move' but claimed that it has left 'many people' in 'tremendous . despair'. The report . concludes: 'The removal of the spare room subsidy should be suspended . immediately – and fully re-evaluated in light of the evidence of its . negative impacts on the right to adequate housing and the general . well-being of many vulnerable individuals and households.' Mr . Duncan Smith said the report was 'biased, poorly researched and . contains inaccuracies the author refused to correct even when they were . pointed out to her'. He . claimed Miss Rolnik had failed to change several mistakes in her report, . including a reference to 'increasing unemployment', adding: 'I welcome . scrutiny of all our welfare reforms, but this report is utterly . ridiculous. 'It's frankly . staggering that someone operating in the name of the UN doesn't appear . to realise that unemployment is falling in the UK, not increasing. 'We . have one of the most generous housing safety nets in the western world, . and I would respectfully suggest Miss Rolnik could find another more . pressing international issue to turn her attention to.'

"By . Mark Duell . and Chris Pleasance . He was named as the sexiest ginger man in a poll last month, beating actors Michael Fassbender and Damian Lewis into first place. But Prince Harry insisted to the wounded servicemen and women joining him on his 124-mile South Pole trek last year that his beard was blond, it has been revealed. The 29-year-old royal grew his facial hair during the epic 10-day journey, but told crew members that it was definitely not red. Scroll down for video . Growth: Prince Harry insisted to the wounded servicemen and women joining him on his 124-mile South Pole trek last year that his beard was blond . Exhausting trek: The 29-year-old royal grew the beard during the epic 10-day journey last December . Team members said that Harry had been asking them: ‘Do you think it’s blond?’ - and when they told him ‘no’, he replied ‘Well, at least I’m not grey', reported the Daily Star. The revelation of the joke comes as a new clip of Harry to be screened on TV shows the moment he suffered a health scare during his trek last December. The footage shows Harry laid low by crippling altitude sickness and exhaustion that forced him to rest for 36 hours wile trekking across the Antarctic. As doctors check he still has feeling in his limbs, the prince admits: 'Antarctica jumped up and bit me on the ass. Eventually, on December 13, Harry and the rest of the team reached the South Pole in record-breaking time . Harry undertook the journey dragging an 11st sledge over the snow and ice, alongside 12 servicemen and women from the UK and teams from other nations. But the exertion and the high altitude, as well as dehydration combined to leave him drained. During the eighth day, after a nagging headache, he tells a medic: 'It feels as though it's expanding. It's getting worse and worse.' Harry explains later: 'If you show a weakness to Antarctica, I think it exploits it. And I think it will slowly grind you down until you have the utmost respect for it, which I now have. 'I thought I could come out here and just crack on and see it through without any issues, make sure I'm here for the guys when they need me.

'I'm frustrated and disappointed in myself, but it really does prove how physically and mentally tough these guys are,' he said of his fellow adventurers, some of whom had lost limbs or suffered other injuries during service in Afghanistan. After checking whether he had vomited from the sickness, medics ordered Harry to rest for 36 hours, which he found frustrating. ‘Being tent-bound really sucks. I don't really enjoy sitting around and doing nothing, especially when I know they're walking 17km (11 miles).

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Usually it's the dogs that do the fetching, but that wasn't the case this weekend when emergency crews were brought in to retrieve a dog that became stranded on a cliff face in Northern California. The black-and-whie Labrador named Oreo needed rescuing after she wandered 40 feet down a 90-foot cliff face Saturday afternoon at Portugese Beach in Sonoma County. 'It was kind of like a billy goat trail the dog went down,' Cpt Todd Rollings of the Bodega Bay Fire Protection District told the Press Democrat. 'Even the dog realized it was a dumb move.' Scroll down for video . Helping out man's best friend: A dog named Oreo was rescued by a helicopter crew after wandering 40 feet down a 90-foot cliff face Saturday in Northern California . Firefighters got a call about Oreo at 1:47pm and the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department was brought in to help with the rescue mission. Rescuers initially tried calling at the dog to come back up the hill, but scared Oreo wouldn't budge. They also considered a rope rescue over the cliff's edge, but had a hard time maneuvering the necessary vehicles close enough to the ledge. Eventually, they settled on using a helicopter with a sheriff's deputy attached on a 100-foot line to hover over the scene and collect Oreo. Helicopter pilot Paul Bradley took a few low passes over the area so Oreo wouldn't be too spooked when they come in for the rescue. Bring in the helicopter: Firefighters got a call about the stranded dog Saturday afternoon and eventually settled on an air rescue . Let's get out of here: Oreo was more than happy to be rescued by the sheriff's deputy dangling from an 100-foot line . Up and out: The sheriff's deputy bear-hugged Oreo and then kicked off from the edge and they took off toward level ground . Back on level land: Oreo's owner, a woman from San Pablo who drove up for the day, was relieved to be reunited with her dog . Then Deputy Henri Boustany strapped on to the end of a rope and was picked up off the ground and flown over to Oreo. Not sure how the dog would react to a stranger wearing a flight suit and helmet, Deputy Boustany brought a towel with him to throw over the dog's head in case she decided to bite. Luckily, there was no need since it was obvious that Oreo was more than happy to be rescued. 'The dog and I got to know each other real quick,' Boustany said. 'I think the dog just wanted to be out of there.' Footage taken from the helicopter shows Bosutany swooping in and bear-hugging Oreo before kicking off from the face and dropping the dog off back on the level ground. The crowd gathered to watch Oreo's rescue broke out in applause when she was handed off the firefighters, and eventually back to his relieved owner - a San Pablo woman who had driven up for the day. 'She was stoked,' Boustany said. 'She was very happy lady.'",Black-and-white Labrador wandered 40 feet down 90-foot cliff .

When a vehicle races up behind the pigeon, the men both yell out simultaneously as if to warn the bird. 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, ease up. Ease up!' one of the males says.

"By . Kate Lyons . This is the extraordinary moment a man kicked in a door, smashed panes of glass and sprayed two security guards with pepper spray in a violent attack at a McDonalds restaurant in Ireland. Rafal Smolinski, 29, has been charged with criminal damage and public offences over the brazen attack at the fast food restaurant in Galway, which was captured by a witness on camera. The footage, which at time of writing had more than 45,000 views on YouTube, shows a man furiously kicking in the glass of a door to the restaurant in the early hours of Friday, March 14. Rafal Smolinkski launched a violent attack on a McDonalds in Galway, which was captured on camera . One of the security guards calls for help, as Smolinski managed to smash through the glass on the door . A male staff member holds the door shut while signalling for others to help him. The man manages to kick the glass in, at which point he leans through the door frame and appears to yell: ‘So you want to f*** my mother?’ He then pulls out a can of pepper spray and sprays the staff member, who is seen later in the video wiping his eyes on his arm. At this point customers start screaming and swearing in panic. Another staff member attempts to stop Mr Smolinski, hitting him with a yellow cone, the type used to indicate that floors are wet. Someone in the video can be heard yelling: 'He's got pepper spray!' as Smolinski leans inside the restaurant and sprays the security guard . A second security guard comes to the aid of his colleague, using a yellow cone as a weapon . The attacker flees temporarily, but then returns, launching another pepper spray attack while yelling ‘You want to f*** my mother? You f***ing bastard!’ He is then pulled away by his friends onto the street, though he returns to pull down his pants and moon the diners. In a lighthearted moment, a customer can be heard asking in the video: 'Can I have a cheeseburger?', showing witnesses were not too traumatised by the event. Police were called to the scene. Mr Smolinski was arrested shortly after the incident. The security guards were taken to nearby Galway University Hospital but were later discharged. Smolinski resorted to pepper spray again to ward off the second security guard . Both of the security guards were hit with pepper spray during the attack and were taken to hospital after the incident, though they were later discharged . Mr Smolinski appeared in Galway district court on March 15. He is due to appear again before the court on March 22. It is unknown what prompted the attack.
