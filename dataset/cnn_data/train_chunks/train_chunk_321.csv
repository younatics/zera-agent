"(CNN) -- You know those electronic collars that zap dogs that stray outside their electronic fences? That seems to be the purpose of everyone's favorite and seemingly innocuous phrase, ""man up."" Just mumbling those two words in a typical guy's direction delivers a psychological shock that discourages him from venturing outside the restrictions of our traditional view of what it means to be a man. Famed author Norman Mailer, known for his machismo and string of women, once said ""tough guys don't dance"" -- something I'm sure would be news to the men of the NFL, who are known for their machismo, string of women and, well, dancing in the end zone wearing tights. But that's the beauty of ""man up."" Sometimes it's the punchline shared among friends. Sometimes a mandate from strangers. At no point is it uniformly defined. Dolphins' Incognito-Martin mess: Is coach to blame? The irony in all of this, of course, is that it takes more strength to follow one's own parameters than to stick to those handed down by the collective. A truth we're constantly reminded of in Bible verses; Robert Frost's ""The Road Less Traveled""; and pop culture fixtures, like the 1976 flick ""Car Wash,"" in which the cross-dressing character, Lindy, confronts a critic with the iconic line: ""I'm more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever get."" And yet, despite these constant reminders of the strength it takes to be ourselves, when presented with an opportunity to recognize that strength, someone yells ""man up"" and we all retreat back behind the electronic fence: ridiculing, teasing, sometimes bullying, those who don't immediately follow suit. Because of this, it's hard to ignore the comical dichotomy that is American masculinity today: boisterous grandstanders too afraid to look in the mirror and deal with their own crap. A nation of men stunted by what is known as alexithymia -- an inability to ""discriminate the usual nuances of emotional life"" as defined by Jason Thompson, author of ""Emotionally Dumb: An Overview of Alexithymia."" Psychologist Ron Levant believes ""a mild form of alexithymia is very widespread among adult men."" He says it's a product of the ""male emotional socialization ordeal, which requires boys to restrict the expression of their vulnerable and caring emotions and to be emotionally stoic."" Which makes sense, when you think about the first time we hear things like ""man up"" or ""be a man."" It's never when we're suppressing sensitivity, it's only when we express it. Lack of connection with our feelings hurts our ability to empathize. And if we can't feel with others, how can we truly feel for others? This complexity is being played out in South Florida this week. The Sun Sentinel is reporting that Richie Incognito, the man accused of bullying his Miami Dolphin teammate Jonathan Martin, was told by coaches to ""toughen up"" Martin. ""I'm just trying to weather the storm right now,"" Incognito said. ""This will pass."" And there's plenty of evidence to suggest he's right, for it is Martin -- the Dolphins lineman who left the team, exasperated by months of bullying -- who is widely being criticized for not manning up. As Giants safety Antrel Rolle tweeted, ""in this world in general people will do what u allow them to do."" He was referring to his interpretation of Martin's inaction, but that could easily be applied to the group of similarly sized men who ganged up on young Martin and dubbed him ""Big Weirdo"" because he wasn't the ""norm."" Incognito, a designated team leader, was emboldened because none of Martin's teammates manned up and stopped him. Or worse yet, maybe someone did want to stop him but was too afraid to cross the ""man up"" electronic fence, a fence few men -- including myself -- are willing to cross on a regular basis. So we do what was done to us -- tell little boys not to cry, chastise classmates for being soft-spoken, let a co-worker know that he needs to grow a pair. It's all fun and games until someone's feelings get hurt, right? And then you read a story, like the one of 17-year-old Steven Liu -- who last week jumped to his death from a pedestrian bridge near his high school, and who some said was a victim of bullying -- and you remember: Sometimes the continuous call to fit in, to ""man up,"" hurts more than just our feelings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson says men have an ingrained fear of expressing their emotions .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A judge in Niagara Falls, New York, has apologized for jailing nearly four dozen people over a ringing mobile phone in his courtroom, his attorney said Wednesday. In removing City Court Judge Robert Restaino from office Tuesday, the state Commission on Judicial Conduct called his decision to lock up 46 people after no one claimed ownership of the phone ""a gross deviation from the proper role of a judge."" But Restaino's lawyer, Terrence Connors, said Wednesday the judge ""profoundly apologizes for his actions"" during the March 2005 hearing and will appeal the panel's ruling. ""It is our hope that the Court of Appeals will measure those few hours against a decade of exemplary conduct on the bench,"" Connors said in a written statement. But the commission found Restaino's conduct so egregious that his 11 years of service and clean record did not matter. ""We conclude that respondent's behavior ... warrants the sanction of removal, notwithstanding his previously unblemished record on the bench and the testimony as to his character and reputation,"" the panel ruled. According to the commission report, Restaino was presiding over a domestic-violence case when a ringing mobile phone interrupted proceedings. When no one took responsibility for the ringing phone, Restaino ordered that court security officers search for the device. About 70 defendants were in the courtroom that day to take part in a monitoring program for domestic violence offenders. When no one admitted to owning the phone, Restaino heard the remaining cases and then recalled the cases of defendants who had already been released to question them about the phone, according to the commission report. After all the defendants denied having the phone or knowing who it belonged to, Restaino sent 46 people to jail. Fourteen who were unable to make bail were handcuffed and jailed for several hours. According to the report, Restaino decided to release defendants only after learning reporters were inquiring about their incarceration.

"(CNN) -- Legendary soul singer Aretha Franklin has canceled two free concerts in New York because of an injury, according to a statement issued by her publicists Wednesday. ""Due to fractured ribs and pain in the abdomen, it was necessary for Ms. Franklin to cancel and reschedule the two concerts,"" said the statement from spokeswoman Gwendolyn Quinn. Franklin's doctors have advised her to come in for tests immediately, the statement said. Efforts are being made to reschedule the concerts at the end of August, Quinn said. ""I was very much looking forward to being in Brooklyn and having a foot-long hot dog at Coney Island,"" Franklin said in the statement. ""Hopefully I will get it before the end of August."" Franklin, 68, also noted, ""I will really miss that nice slice of cake from Congressman Charlie Rangel's birthday party and singing 'Happy Birthday' to him."" Franklin, dubbed the ""Queen of Soul,"" was scheduled to perform at Rangel's 80th birthday party on August 11, the statement said. The two scheduled performances in Brooklyn were part of a concert series presented by Marty Markowitz, president of Brooklyn borough, Quinn said. The shows were scheduled for Wingate Field in East Flatbush on August 9, and Asser Levy Park in Brighton Beach on August 12. They were to be Franklin's first concerts in Brooklyn, the statement said.","Franklin's doctors have told her to come in for tests immediately .

"(CNN) -- ""The Walking Dead"" returns for a fifth season on AMC Sunday, and fans have been waiting since March to find out the fate of Rick Grimes and many of the survivors. Last season ended with the group having discovered a place called Terminus, which was anything but the sanctuary they were led to believe it was. The residents of Terminus quickly locked them in a train car, but Rick was determined to make an escape with his friends. CNN spoke with executive producer Gale Anne Hurd about what's to come on one of TV's most popular (and secretive) shows. CNN: The survivors were in a lot of danger at the end of the season. Do things move at a quick pace as the season begins? Hurd: You can get a sense of the pacing and the scope from the promos that we've released. We've never left our group of survivors before, in such perilous circumstances. We pick up pretty much where we left off, which is also new for us. CNN: They're in a new situation with Terminus. Are we going to see a lot of changes this season? Hurd: Yes. The prison has been left behind. They've been on the road. Some are still on the road, like Carol, Tyreese and Judith. Beth seems to be in jeopardy as well. We have multiple strands of stories that we're telling in different settings. CNN: Can we expect a big body count coming up? Hurd: Sadly, this is a world in which we tend not to make it to the end with the same characters intact. We can't imagine that this season will be any different. CNN: We've had a lot of human threats lately, as opposed to the walkers. Is that going to continue? Hurd: It is the zombie apocalypse, and the loss of society, civilization, and law and order has enabled all of this to take place. They find themselves in that world, and they have to adapt or die. We see the journey that each character takes, they're all different as to how they adapt, and how they can reconcile the terrible things they've done. Or perhaps they turn evil as the Governor did. CNN: Is there a particular character we should keep an eye on this season? Hurd: As always, Rick goes through a great number of changes, and has over the season. Last season, he threw down a gauntlet, saying that the people of Terminus had no idea who they're dealing with -- which is quite a threat considering that they're locked in a train car. But it shows that he's embraced the mantle of leadership that he tried to throw off in the previous seasons. Carol's journey has been incredibly remarkable, and it will continue to be so. CNN: Five seasons in, are there things that continue to surprise you about this world? Hurd: Robert Kirkman's underlying comic book continues to surprise me, and it's an inspiration for all of us who work on the show. In some ways, we hew closely to it, in others we vary greatly. But it's also something of a road map for us. AMC grabs 'Walking Dead' companion series pilot .","Season five of top-rated ""The Walking Dead"" returns Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The trial of Anthony Sowell, a man accused of raping, killing and dismembering 11 Cleveland-area women between 2007 and 2009, is scheduled to enter a second day Tuesday. Prosecutors spoke for more than an hour during opening statements Monday, detailing each woman Sowell is charged with killing and describing steps police took to obtain arrest warrants and gather evidence at Sowell's house. Pictures were shown to the entire courtroom to further illustrate the scene SWAT team officers and Cleveland police encountered. The defense spoke for just a few minutes, stressing that the state of Ohio has the burden to prove that Sowell committed the homicides. The defense argued that there is no DNA, fingerprints or evidence to prove Sowell committed the killings. The defense also focused on Sowell's character and claimed that he has suffered mentally and physically since a heart attack in 2007 led to the loss of his job. After opening statements, the prosecution's first witness took the stand. Richard Butler is a member of the SWAT team that worked with other Cleveland police to arrest Sowell and gather evidence at his house. Butler is the officer who found the first two bodies in a small room on the third floor of Sowell's house. Sowell has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the 85 counts he faces. Investigators at Sowell's home unearthed remains of five of the 11 women -- ages 25 to 52 -- in October 2009. Since then, other women have come forward alleging that Sowell attacked them too. In April 2010, prosecutors handed down a 10-count indictment against Sowell in connection with the alleged rape of a 34-year-old woman in his home. Sowell's lawyers have declined previous requests by CNN to explain their case, and the suspect has not been interviewed. But in January 2010, attorney John Parker told The Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland that he felt police violated Sowell's Miranda rights as he was being interrogated. Sowell grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18, and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. People who interacted with him after his 2005 release from prison, where he had served 15 years for attempted rape, said he appeared to be ""a normal guy,"" known locally for selling scrap metal. His inconspicuous two-story home sits in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant, where one in five homes was in foreclosure and at least a third of residents got food stamps, according to a 2010 study by Case Western Reserve University's Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development. Neighbors and even a city councilman had failed to realize that the stench wafting in the area around Sowell's home was from human flesh, not a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Moreover, the disappearance of the 11 women -- many of whom lived nearby -- went largely unnoticed for almost two years, with only four of them even being reported missing. Many of his alleged victims struggled with drug addiction at some point in their lives, with court records showing that many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. In late 2008, Gladys Wade told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer, and when she declined, punched her in the face several times. Wade said that he then tried to rape her, dragging her toward his home, adding that she got out only after ""gouging his face."" Police investigated Wade's complaint, with one police report noting blood droplets on Sowell's walls and steps. But officers told CNN affiliate WKYC that the case was dropped after Wade declined to press charges. After Wade's complaint, six more women would disappear. Then, on September 23, 2009, a 36-year-old Cleveland woman told police a story eerily similar to those of Wade and the woman whose 1989 account led to Sowell's first conviction for attempted rape. She said he'd invited her into his home for beer, punched her in the face, then began performing oral sex on her -- releasing her only after she promised to return the next day. Sowell was then arrested. More than a month later, police entered his house and found two bodies rotting in his attic. These were the first of the 11 bodies they'd eventually discover, in various states of decay, on his property. Most of the women whose remains were found in and around Sowell's home were strangled by ligature -- which can include a string, cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand, officials said. Seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks. A skull is all that remains of one victim. It was found wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home's basement. While the prosecution will press its case against Sowell in the coming weeks, this may not be the end of his story -- even if he is eventually given a death sentence. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason has said that his cold case unit is reviewing unsolved murders that occurred during the time Sowell lived in Cleveland and East Cleveland to see if there are any connections. Mason said the group is working its way through 75 cases.","Anthony Sowell has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal have tied up a $240 million deal with Emirates as the club looks to end its seven year trophy drought. The EPL club has extended its shirt partnership with Emirates until the end of the 2018/19 season, while the airline will also continue its hold on naming rights of the stadium until 2028. The sponsorship, which is estimated to be worth around $48 million a year, has been hailed as a deal 'all about football' by Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis, who insisted money would be available for player investment in June 2013 when the club receives the first payment from Emirates. The latest agreement, according to Gazidis, will give Arsenal, ""the resources in what we believe is a responsible and well managed way, to be able to invest in what we put onto the pitch for our fans."" Manchester United sends DHL packing . In July Manchester United signed a seven-year shirt deal with U.S. car giant Chevrolet worth $72 million a season up until 2021, while Liverpool's four-year shirt deal with Standard Chartered which was signed back in 2009 is worth $128 million in total. Manchester City signed a 10-year deal with Etihad for naming rights and shirt sponsorship worth a reported mammoth $641 million only last years. But Arsenal insist that only United's shirt deal is worth more and that their deal with Emirates is the second most valuable in Europe. However, the club receives around $85 million from sponsorships, which is far less than that of its rivals including Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United. And while it posted the third-best sales figures for the year ending May 31 of $389 million, it still lags behind its rivals on the field. The Gunners' inability to win a trophy since 2005 under manager Arsene Wenger has led to supporter frustration with the team's inability to challenge for top honors. Daniel Geey, an associate for Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP and an expert on finance within football, believes Arsenal's sponsorship deal is a sign of the impact that Financial Fair Play is starting to have on the Premier League. Fair play? Football clubs seek to beat financial offside trap . ""The Arsenal deal will however only begin in time for the 2014-15 season which means the financial uplift is still some time away,"" Geey told CNN. ""Depending on how the revenues are apportioned between the shirt and stadium deal, only the future Manchester United Chevrolet $72 million a season shirt deal (also starting in 2014-15) is significantly higher in the Premier League. ""It means that in the Premier League alone, there have been some very large recent sponsorship deals with Liverpool's $128 million four-year shirt sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered in September 2009 and Manchester City's reported 10 year $641m shirt, stadium and community deal with Etihad. ""Bearing in mind the latest bumper UK and foreign broadcasting deals that have been announced by the Premier League (forecasted to be around $8bn )and the prospect of some type of salary cap being proposed in the Premier League, it is clear that owners are looking to aggressively maximize revenues whilst to some degree constraining wages. ""It may well be that FFP has had the desired 'belt tightening' effect."" Under the new FFP rules, owners can only contribute a maximum of $55.5 million for the 2013-14 and 2015 seasons together, and $37 million during the period covering 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18. Current rules state that should clubs incur losses in excess of $60 million over a three-year period, they will be hit with sanctions as well as exclusion from the Champions League and Europa League.","Arsenal has signed a $240 million sponsorship deal with Emirates .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi human rights activist Hanaa Edwar has proved she is not afraid to speak her mind. In June this year she stormed into a televised government conference and harangued Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki about the arrest of four protesters by the army. In a video clip widely circulated on YouTube she holds up photos of the young protesters and shouts: ""We, HR (human rights) NGOs accused of being terrorists, is this possible?"" Edwar, the 65-year-old secretary of an Iraqi human rights association, Al-Amal, laughs as she looks back at the clip. She said her outburst was sparked by comments by Al-Maliki. ""He said I ask my friends and U.N. to see that some of the HR organizations in Iraq, they are killers and criminals,"" said Edwar. ""It is my duty to say something in this situation, I can't be shut up."" Al-Amal was founded in 1992 after the Gulf War to help relieve the suffering of Iraqi people and build a just and democratic society, according to the organization. There have been demonstrations in Iraq since February demanding basic services and reforms. Both Al-Amal and Human Rights Watch are concerned the government is trying to portray the protesters as terrorists, and allowing thugs to beat and sexually assault them. Despite her long career in human rights, Edwar is pessimistic about the current state of her country. ""We are losing everything now in Iraq, even you know, our dream for democracy, our dream for elections,"" she said. She said she is inspired to continue her work by young people like 21-year-old Noof Assi, one of her employees. Who are Middle East's most influential women? Assi brushes off the harassment she receives driving to work each day through checkpoints manned by security forces. ""I don't trust them,"" she said. ""Sometimes they just become aggressive with the people, sometimes because I am a girl and driving they make fun of me."" Assi has long kept a blog and wrote about the terror she lived through at the age of 17 during the Iraq War. She said: ""One day I remember my sister hit me and she told me 'Come on, cry,' because I couldn't drop any tear because I see dead people, I see people killed in front of me, so the life at that time doesn't matter for me."" One entry from her blog at the time read: ""I dream to sleep without painkillers, I dream to wake up in a home that gives me love and hope, not to end it up in a grave."" Assi has also set up a website, Iqpalmtree, celebrating heroic and accomplished Iraqi women throughout history. She said: ""My first goal was to make the Iraqis know about their women, because in our culture they don't take them seriously, that's what I want to change."" Among those featured are Marie Teresar Asmer, an adventurer born in 1804 whose original diary is on display in the UK, and Hanaa Sadiz, an award-winning fashion designer currently working in Europe. And of course, her idol, Hanaa Edwar.","Human rights activist stormed into government conference to confront Nuri Al-Maliki .

"Positano, Italy (CNN)  -- Dramatically steep seaside cliffs, quaint multicolored hillside buildings and sweeping views of the sea captivate visitors as they enter scenic Positano, perched along Italy's Amalfi Coast. The small, slow-paced Tyrrhenian Sea resort town is tucked into the Lattari Mountains and surrounded by colorful flowers and sweet-smelling lemon and orange trees. Positano was a sleepy fishing village that began to attract large numbers of tourists in the 1950s after John Steinbeck published an essay about the town in Harper's Bazaar, tourism officials say. ""Nearly always when you find a place as beautiful as Positano, your impulse is to conceal it,"" Steinbeck wrote. But it's not a secret anymore. Today, travelers from around the world come to enjoy the beach, play in the clear blue Tyrrhenian waters and explore the charming town's many family-owned boutiques and restaurants. Many tourists consider Positano, on the south side of the Sorrentine Peninsula,  to be one of the most picturesque of Italy's coastal resorts, and business owners welcome the heavy stream of visitors who come to town each year. Views from the Spiaggia Grande Beach, near Positano's downtown area, are spectacular. In addition to the sparkling sea, you can marvel at the architecture of the buildings stacked together almost like stairs up the slopes of the steep town. The beach consists of coarse sand and small, smooth pebbles. Though not silky to the touch like beaches in the Florida Panhandle, the rounded pebbles are small enough to make them comfortable to walk or sunbathe on. Because of the steep cliffs surrounding the area, the morning and afternoon sunlight is mostly obscured, so midday is the best beach time for sun worshipers. Positano is known for hot, dry summers and mild winters. May through October has the best beach weather, when the air is warm (highs in the 70s and 80s) and comfortable. October through January are typically the rainy months. Visitors who want to be on the water can head to Marina Grande, where you can rent a boat, windsurf, snorkel or dive. From the marina, you can also take a popular boat ride to Capri, an island with dramatic cliffs along the sea where international tourists and Italians alike flock for relaxing getaways. Beyond the water, a major attraction is the church of Santa Maria Assunta, in the center of town. The church features a large dome covered in maiolica tiles and a collection of art, including a 13th-century Byzantine wooden panel depicting the Virgin Mary and her child. In the town's steep, narrow streets, you'll discover many shops selling fashionable clothes handmade in Positano. This resort town is known for its production of dresses, pants and blouses made of cotton or linen, many of which are one of a kind. The town is known for its lemons, and Positano shop owners capitalize on this by selling lemon sweets, perfumes, soaps and home decor, among other things. Be sure to buy at least one lemon-themed item while you browse around town. If hiking is part of your agenda, take a walk from Positano along the Amalfi Coast on various panoramic trails. The popular ""Walk of the Gods"" path links Positano to the village of Praiano. Spectacular views of the sea thrill hikers along the trail, which takes about six hours to hike. A bus at the end of the journey will return hikers to Positano. After a long, fun-filled day, your taste buds will be ready for Positano's many local specialties based on fresh seafood from local fishermen. Dishes such as boiled octopus salad and spaghetti with mussels are among the many foods commonly served. Those not fond of seafood can always opt for a variety of pasta dishes or pizza Margherita dressed with olive oil or bruschetta, to name a few. The most popular dining venues tend to be those by the water, offering tables with sea views. However, restaurants at the top of the cliffs offer equally spectacular panoramic views. In addition to Positano's culinary and scenic attractions, the town is rich with history. Positano was once part of the powerful Republic of Amalfi, a rival of Venice as a sea power in the 10th century. The economy was predominately based on the fishing industry until tourists discovered its beauty in the 1950s. Steinbeck wrote of its entrancing beauty: ""It is a dream place that isn't quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone."" Getting there . • Naples International Airport is the closest to Positano. Taxis, buses and shuttle services can transport you 36 miles from Naples to Positano. • Train service does not go directly to Positano. Sorrento is the nearest train stop, where you can hire a taxi, private shuttle or catch a bus for the nine-mile journey. • If you have a car, Positano is along Route 163, which curves around the Amalfi Coast. Where to stay . • Expensive: Hotel Le Sirenuse - Long celebrated as a resort for the rich and famous. The guest rooms all have terraces overlooking the town. • Moderate: Domina Home Royal - Guests can enjoy panoramic views of the sea and town. Where to eat . • Ristorante il Ritrovo: A family-owned restaurant high above the town along a mountain road. Seafood and pasta dishes dominate the menu. • Buca di Bacco: This restaurant has a strong emphasis on seafood and is along the beach. Tourist information: . The tourist office, at Via del Saraceno 4 (telephone: 39-089875067; e-mail: info@aziendaturismopositano.it) can answer many questions travelers may have.","Positano, Italy, is a small resort town along the Amalfi Coast .

"(CNN) -- November is National Adoption Awareness Month in the U.S. and in many countries around the world. We celebrate every child's right to grow up in a loving, permanent family where they can live their lives with dignity. Adoption is a deep, meaningful way to create families and provide orphaned and vulnerable children a protected, safe and secure environment in which to grow and thrive. By 2005, there were 23,000 international adoptions to the U.S., from many countries around the world. But unfortunately, over the last six years, the numbers have plummeted to 11,000 in 2010 ... and probably much less by the end of 2011. The Hague regulations for inter-country adoption were implemented in 2008 in the U.S. and have protected children from trafficking. At the same time, this bureaucracy has paralyzed the process of adoption, making it inefficient and cumbersome. Millions of children around the globe lose their parents to extreme poverty, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, conflict, war and natural disasters, often forcing family members to relinquish and abandon their children to orphanages. People without education and jobs, and communities without economic strength and social welfare infrastructure, cannot support orphans. Globally, UNICEF estimates that 153 million of those under the age of 18 have lost one or both parents and are considered orphans; 18 million children have lost both parents. Adoption can ensure permanency, but it cannot solve the tragic destiny of millions of children living without parental care in dire circumstances fast enough. The process of change to provide permanency to all these children in need will take decades. We are at a crossroads of urgency. What happens to the children left behind? Some are institutionalized, and others are forced to live on the street or in refugee camps or as slaves to other families: for example, restaveks in Haiti. Children are bought and sold as prostitutes or forced into a life of crime, drug dealing and alcoholism, and many are child laborers making up a large part of the major work force of countries abroad. Still others become child soldiers fighting ethnic wars in tyrant-run countries. When families survive, the head of the household may be a child 8 years old or even younger. Girls are forced into very early marriages even before they menstruate, robbing them of educational opportunities and choices about their future. The damage done to children in these circumstances is horrific and has lifelong consequences. The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child states that every child has a right to safety, health and an education, as well as the right to participate fully in family, cultural and social life. The U.S. and the international community must find permanent solutions to address the international orphan crisis. Effective and innovative strategies need to be implemented and more resources must be devoted to preventing child abandonment and helping families to remain intact or to be reunified and reintegrated. Investment in child welfare systems with trained social workers capable of case management in impoverished countries must be the highest priority to strengthen and support families and communities. Families need economic opportunities to make a viable living and social services to help guide them out of poverty. Access to medical care and psychosocial services and universal, free education must be available for all children and their families. Without such support services, families are more likely to be torn apart by poverty and become victims of depression and hopelessness, which continues the cycle of relinquishment and abandonment. We must figure out how families and communities survive poverty and adversity. What are the intrinsic cultural mechanisms that work in one country and not in another? Children living in orphanages need professionally trained staff members/caretakers who are committed and invested in the psychological welfare of each child. Orphans must be reintegrated into their communities by attending local schools so that they are not isolated and stigmatized. Orphanages should be downsized and be more like group homes, run family-style, and foster care (using the South Korean model) could be introduced as a better alternative to residential care facilities. Governments need to invest in strategic plans to de-institutionalize the care of orphans, making these programs a shared responsibility of society. Attitudes need to be changed about disabled children from ethnic minorities so that there is inclusion of all children into the fabric of life in all developing countries. I've witnessed orphans living in squalid and tragic conditions. Once they age out of the orphanage, they often leave uneducated and unprepared for life outside the institution; they are destined for poor physical and mental health and dependency on welfare systems rather than becoming independent and capable of creating their own families and developing and contributing their own talents to their societies. Realizing that millions of orphaned children would never be adopted fast enough, I founded Worldwide Orphans Foundation. It is committed to transforming the lives of orphaned children by providing them with medical, developmental and psychosocial care and educational opportunities in their own communities. Our long-term holistic programing includes education, health care, sports and recreation, camps, early intervention, special education, youth programs and computer technology to help kids become independent adults who are successful and resilient. This month, we celebrate the loving, permanent families that are created through adoption. As a pediatrician caring for newly adopted children, I've seen the magic of adoption more than 10,000 times.

"(CNN) -- It looks like New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady underestimated Buffalo when he took a jab at the upstate New York city's hotels Wednesday. The insult came as Brady was praising his father, Tom Brady Sr., for his dedication to his son's career. The elder Brady travels all over the country to watch his son play. ""I don't know if any of you guys have ever been to the hotels in Buffalo, but they're not the nicest places in the world,"" the younger Brady said. Brady has apologized for insulting the area's lodging options during a pre-Super Bowl press conference, according to The Buffalo News. But not before the city's hotels and tourism officials went on the offensive. ""Tom Brady comes to Buffalo once a year, and to pass judgment like that I think is just irresponsible at best,"" Bryan Drew, general manager of Embassy Suites, told CNN affiliate WIVB. ""We've got some great hotels, especially here downtown."" The local tourism organization, Visit Buffalo Niagara, also took issue with Brady's slam. ""Buffalo Niagara is filled with excellent hotel options to meet the needs of the most refined travelers,"" said Ed Healy, vice president of marketing. ""P.S. - go Giants!"" Healy mentioned the historic Roycroft Inn in East Aurora and The Mansion on Delaware Avenue as examples of the area's upscale properties. The Mansion's owner, Geno Principe, offered Brady and his family a free night at the hotel in response to the dig at Buffalo. Buffalo News sports columnist Jerry Sullivan spoke with Brady about the offer from the elite hotel. ""I appreciate that,"" Brady responded, then said, ""I apologize for saying that."" The offer of a free night wasn't the most popular move among some of the posters on The Mansion's Facebook page. ""Tom Brady, a free night? Why? He's an insulting, pompous (fill in the blank),"" wrote Kathy Dembek-Licata. The Mansion said on its Facebook page that it's ""having a bit of fun"" with the incident, using it to promote the Buffalo area. ""Tom Brady is an exceptional athlete and, much like the Patriots, The Mansion also strives for excellence!""","Tom Brady said Buffalo hotels ""not the nicest places in the world""

"(CNN) -- The federal government is recommending changing the amount of fluoride in drinking water for the first time in 50 years. The Department of Health and Human Services and Environmental Protection Agency are proposing the change because of an increase in fluorosis -- a condition that causes spotting and streaking on children's teeth. The government is proposing that the recommended amount of fluoride in drinking water be set at 0.7 milligrams per liter of water. The recommended range has been 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per liter since 1962. The EPA will determine whether the maximum amount of fluoride allowed in water will also be lowered. Fluoride was first added to water in the United States in the 1940s to help prevent tooth decay in children 8 years and under. ""One of water fluoridation's biggest advantages is that it benefits all residents of a community -- at home, work, school or play,"" said Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Howard Koh.  ""And fluoridation's effectiveness in preventing tooth decay is not limited to children, but extends throughout life, resulting in improved oral health."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says dental fluorosis is highest among adolescents between the ages of 12 an 15.  One reason for the increase in fluorosis: Americans now have access to fluoride from a variety of sources, including toothpaste, mouth rinses and prescription supplements, the Department of Health and Human Services says . ""Dental fluorosis in the United States appears mostly in the very mild form -- as barely visible lacy white markings or spots on the enamel,"" The department said in a statement Friday. ""The severe form of dental fluorosis, with staining and pitting on the tooth surface, is rare in the United States."" The change is being made now, according to an administration official, because the current range is out of date. He said that in the 1960s, when fluoridating water began, air conditioning was much less common. So children in hotter regions drank more water and needed lower levels of fluoride to protect their teeth, while children in colder climates drank less water and needed higher levels. ""Now since air conditioning is so common,"" the official said, ""you don't see those differences in consumption, and that's why they're getting rid of the range and recommending one level."" The American Dental Association says the new recommended levels will still reduce tooth decay but minimize fluorosis. The group says it continues to support fluoridation of community water as a safe and effective way to prevent tooth decay. ""This is a superb example of a government agency fulfilling its mission to protect and enhance the health of the American people,"" said ADA President Dr. Raymond F. Gist. ""We have always looked to the federal health agencies to guide us on this and other public health matters, and we will continue to do so. We applaud the Department of Health and Human Services for reaffirming the safety and efficacy of optimal community water fluoridation, with science on their side."" The Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization whose goal is to protect public health and the environment, says it has been pushing governmental officials to reduce fluroide levels for years. ""We've had to wait too long, but the government's official, belated -- and perhaps begrudging -- announcement marks its recognition that fluoride policies have been out of step with the science on the tap-water additive's toxicity to children, and that many American children are at risk from excess fluoride in drinking water and other sources,"" said Jane Houlihan, senior vice president for research at the Environmental Working Group. ""Since 2005, EWG has been calling on federal agencies to respond to these findings, which come from National Academy of Sciences and many others, documenting that excess fluoride exposure poses dangers that range from discolored teeth to potential hormone disruption and neurotoxicity. HHS has taken an important first step. Now it's up to water utilities to respond and for the EPA to lower its high, legal limit on fluoride in drinking water, which is more than five times higher than the new maximum recommended amount."" The recommendations have been submitted to the Federal Register for a 30-day public comment period. The final version is expected this spring.","There has been an increase in a condition called fluorosis .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- David Nelson, the older brother in TV's Ozzie and Harriet Nelson family, died Tuesday after a battle with colon cancer, publicist Dale Olson said Wednesday. Nelson was 74. Nelson died at his Century City, California, home with his wife of 36 years, Yvonne, at his side, Olson said. He was 16 in 1952 when he joined his parents, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, and younger brother Rick on the radio show ""Here Come the Nelsons,"" which soon became television's ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet."" The TV show was shot in the family's real Hollywood Hills home and was based on the real family. The sons' roles were originally played by actors when the radio show began, but David and Rick persuaded their parents to let them join the cast in its first year. David Nelson directed and produced several episodes of the series during its 16-year run, Olson said. While the show made Rick a teen idol and launch his music career, David became a successful director and producer. Nelson was born in New York on October 24, 1936, but his father, actor-bandleader Ozzie Nelson, and mother, singer Harriet Hilliard, moved the family to Los Angeles. He attended Hollywood High and the University of Southern California. Rick Nelson died in a plane crash on December 31, 1985. His father died in 1975 and his mother's death came in 1994. Along with his wife, David Nelson is survived by sons John, Eric, James and Danny, and daughter Teri. His acting credits included movies roles between 1957 and 1965 in films such as ""Peyton Place,"" ""The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker,"" and ""The Big Circus,"" in which he won critical acclaim as a homicidal trapeze artist, according to a biography released by his publicist. He also acted in ""Day of the Outlaw,"" ""-30-,"" ""The Big Show,"" ""Love and Kisses,"" ""Hondo"" and ""Swing Out."" He co-starred with his mother in the 1976 film ""Smash-Up on Interstate 5."" Nelson's television roles included ""Up in Smoke,"" ""The Love Boat,"" ""High School USA,"" ""A Family for Joe"" and guest starring roles in series of that period, his biography says. Along with his directorial work on his family's TV series, Nelson directed ""O.K. Crackerby,"" ""Childish Things,"" ""Easy to be Free,"" ""Ozzie's Girls,"" ""Death Screams,"" ""Last Plane Out,"" ""Goodnight, Beantown,"" and ""A Rare Breed,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- Mother's Day is a sad occasion for many, but not all of the 15 million U.S. stepmothers who have stepchildren under the age of 18. As it approaches, I am reminded how disappointed and hurt I used to be when my stepdaughter didn't acknowledge me on this day. From the time I married my husband when my stepdaughter was only 4 years old, I always felt she viewed me as his wife rather than as a stepmother. This distinction may be acceptable to women who marry men with older children, but it bothered me because for years I spent every other weekend playing with her, cooking for her, and doing every other activity of a maternal caregiver. I really tried to develop a close relationship with but never felt I succeeded. Being ignored is minor compared to the hostility and emotional abuse many other stepmothers experience, but my sense of failure grew each time I tried to grow closer to my stepdaughter and was rebuffed. My husband inadvertently compounded my discomfort each Mother's Day by asking me what kind of gift I wanted. His gesture of kindness felt like he was offering me a present for failing a class, which increased my feelings of shame rather than joy. Also, I hate pretense, and I felt that he was pressuring me to accept his view of our happy family unit. He was unwilling to acknowledge my perception that my relationship with my stepdaughter was friendly yet superficial, and just not as intimate as I expected it to be given the time we spent together. I felt he valued his feelings more than mine, and I became angry that my feelings weren't given equal standing to his. Being wished a Happy Mother's Day by my parents and friends also felt bad. How could I sincerely accept their considerate remarks when my stepdaughter didn't recognize or appreciate my efforts in this capacity? I felt fraudulent as a stepmother. Thankfully, my feelings have changed and, now I am in a better place where I accept and understand why my stepdaughter will not reach out to me on Mother's Day. I just wish other stepmothers wouldn't have to go through similar or far worse emotional distress. If stepmothers weren't so unhappy, the divorce rate for second marriages, as high as 60% to 75%, might be reduced. Let me share my journey with you. When I first became a stepmother, I was surprised to find it to be so difficult because my stepdaughter has always been well-behaved, smart and respectful. No matter how hard I tried to get close to her, I felt like a distant relative. I wondered if my experience was unique or similar to other stepmothers so I started a website (stepsforstepmothers.com) which featured an online chat room and a questionnaire for stepmothers to fill out. Almost instantaneously, a vibrant community of stepmothers formed that gave each other encouragement and advice during difficult times. In less than two years from the inception of the website, more than 3,000 women answered my questionnaire sharing the challenges they faced. At the same time, I also began a monthly stepmother support group comprised of a handful of women who could fit into my small office. From these three venues, I gained a lot of information about the specific problems stepmothers encounter. More important, I received the necessary support from women sharing similar experiences. This helped me overcome my feelings of inadequacy and isolation. Being understood by others is so important. Without a doubt, knowing that I wasn't alone, that there were other stepmothers struggling to find their rightful place in their new families just like me, was the best medicine to heal my pain. While these women couldn't (and shouldn't) have solved my specific problems, they validated my feelings. While my family and friends cared that I was unhappy, they didn't truly understand what was bothering me. These other stepmothers intuitively knew how I felt, and this made me feel much better even though my situation did not actually change. These women also helped me understand that my desire to be acknowledged by my stepdaughter on Mother's Day was not unreasonable, but it might be too much for her to give me. They helped me understand the dilemma that many stepchildren face on Mother's Day. Their loyalties may lie with their mother, and they believe she will be offended if they acknowledge their stepmother. I respect my stepdaughter's love for her mother, and never want her to feel any loyalty binds. So, I worked on developing a thicker skin to shield myself from being hurt. After doing some research, I also learned that only 20% of stepchildren feel close to their stepmothers. As much as I want a close, loving relationship with my stepdaughter or anyone else for that matter, I realized I can't force anyone to love or even like me. My stepdaughter is entitled to select the people she wants in her intimate circle of family and friends. What I can do is appreciate those people in my life who want to be close to me and nurture these relationships. By shifting my focus to the positives rather than the negatives in my life, I am now more content. While my husband used to encourage my stepdaughter to wish me a Happy Mother's Day, she is an adult, and he can't control her actions. Both he and I worked hard to accept the fact that most stepfamilies are not perfect, and ours may never be. ""It is what it is,"" and accepting this reality relieved a lot of wear and tear on my brain as well as his. I used to believe that I must always persevere until my goals were accomplished even if they were insurmountable. What a relief to know that I can be happy even if every aspect of my life isn't perfect. This year I am looking forward to celebrating Mother's Day with my mother and will try to make it as special for her as possible. I have learned that when I focus my energy on her, I feel good. This works for a lot of other stepmothers who choose to spend the holiday with their mothers or with women for whom they deeply care. Many also treat themselves to a massage, lunch with friends or flowers on this day. By choosing to do positive activities on Mother's Day, we take responsibility for our happiness. I hope my experiences can help other stepmothers have a more enjoyable Mother's Day.","Mother's Day can be a struggle for stepmothers and their stepchildren .

"(CNN) -- How close are you to the airport? Is there a decent bar or restaurant on site? The worn-down, travel-weary businessperson is looking for proximity, convenience and comfortable amenities in an airport hotel. There's little time to waste. The Regal Airport Hotel in Hong Kong seems to know what satisfies the road warrior. The hotel was recently named No. 1 in the airport hotel category of the 2013 Skytrax World Airport Awards. (Earlier this month, CNN featured the world's top airport award-winner.) Hong Kong's Regal Airport Hotel secured the top spot for the third year in a row and was also named the best airport hotel in Asia. An enclosed bridge directly connects the hotel to the airport's passenger terminal, so being on time for your flight shouldn't be a problem. The nearly 1,200 room hotel also has six restaurants and bars, in-house conference and meeting facilities, a spa and indoor and outdoor pools. America's 10 highest-tech hotels . Skytrax's World Airport Awards are based on 12.1 million survey questionnaires filled out by passengers covering 108 different nationalities and 395 airports worldwide during a nine-month survey period in 2012 and 2013.

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI announced that it has concluded its investigation into the 2001 anthrax mailings, saying Friday that a biodefense researcher carried out the attacks alone. The anthrax letters killed five people and sickened 17 shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The letters, filled with bacterial spores, were sent to Senate Democratic leaders and news organizations. ""By 2007, investigators conclusively determined that a single spore-batch created and maintained by Dr. Bruce E. Ivins at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) was the parent material for the letter spores,"" said a report released Friday by the FBI. ""Evidence developed from that investigation established that Dr. Ivins, alone, mailed the anthrax letters."" There was no immediate response from Ivins' lawyer. Ivins, 62, committed suicide in July 2008 as federal agents were closing in on him, police said. In September and October 2001, at least five envelopes were mailed to Sen. Patrick Leahy and then-Sen. Tom Daschle, as well as to news organizations in New York and in Boca Raton, Florida. Each envelope contained a photocopy of a handwritten note. The five who died included two Washington postal workers, a New York hospital worker, a supermarket tabloid photo editor in Florida and a 94-year-old woman in Connecticut. The investigation into the anthrax mailings, code-named ""Amerithrax,"" was one of the largest and most complex in the history of law enforcement, according to the FBI. He had spent more than 30 years as a civilian microbiologist at the Army's biological research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland, where he was trying to develop a better vaccine against anthrax. At the time of his death, Ivins was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions. He also had been hospitalized in the weeks leading up to his death for psychiatric examination after he threatened to kill co-workers, investigators ""and other individuals who had wronged him,"" according to documents released in the case. Federal prosecutors named Ivins the culprit in the anthrax attacks after his death. Court records released by authorities showed that Ivins was ""the custodian of a large flask of highly purified anthrax spores that possess certain genetic mutations identical to the anthrax used in the attacks."" The government had taken steps in the weeks leading up to Ivins' death to restrict his access to his lab. But critics point out that then-Attorney General John Ashcroft publicly declared another Fort Detrick scientist, Steven Hatfill, a ""person of interest"" in the anthrax attacks. Hatfill was never charged but sued over the matter, settling with the government for $5.8 million. His case has fueled skepticism about the allegations against Ivins. In November 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Hatfill's libel lawsuit against The New York Times over reports linking him to the anthrax probe. A federal appeals court had concluded Hatfill was a ""public figure"" and failed to prove the reports were ""malicious."" In the report released on Friday, the FBI said Hatfill had been eliminated as a suspect. The report outlines the government's evidence against Ivins, saying that the researcher was alone late at night in the lab where the anthrax strain RMR-1029 was stored in the days leading up to the mailings. The lab also contained the equipment capable of drying the anthrax, a function that was forbidden, the report said. ""Dr. Ivins was never in the habit of working excessive late night hours in the lab, either prior to or after the mailings,"" it said. Ivins was under ""intense personal and professional pressure"" in the months leading up to the anthrax attacks, the report said, citing the researchers' e-mails and statements to friends. ""The anthrax vaccine program to which he had devoted his entire career of more than 20 years was failing. The anthrax vaccines were receiving criticism in several scientific circles, because of both potency problems and allegations that the anthrax vaccine contributed to Gulf War Syndrome,"" it said. ""Short of some major breakthrough or intervention, he feared that the vaccine research program was going to be discontinued. Following the anthrax attacks, however, his program was suddenly rejuvenated."" The report also said that Ivins' e-mails and statements show a ""man driven by obsessions."" ""In the month before his suicide,"" it said, ""his homicidal tendencies became more pronounced, as he posted violent messages on the Internet regarding a reality TV star and made death threats during a group therapy session."" It also says that Ivins made several statements and actions that showed ""evidence of a guilty conscience."" They included sending an e-mail to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that suggested ""nonsensical explanations for why the first victim might have contracted inhalation anthrax,"" and repeatedly made efforts to shift the blame for the mailings to friends and colleagues. ""At one point, he sent an e-mail to himself documenting 12 reasons why two of his former colleagues, who were also his two best friends, likely committed the anthrax attacks,"" the report said.","Biodefense researcher Bruce Ivins acted alone, FBI says .

"Editor's note: CNN contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Seven-year-old Wyatt Wilke wanted to be a Marine and a doctor. (CNN) -- On the morning of last year's annual Sunflower Fair in La Porte, Indiana, a family, appearing a little lost, walked up and down a crowded street, looking in vain for the table to sign up their entry. They carried a large sunflower with them. If no one noticed the exhausted, grieving look in the family's eyes, that was understandable. The Sunflower Fair is a place of happy noise: rides and music and food booths. It is La Porte's fall festival, and people from across northwest Indiana come to spend a Saturday in the midst of the milling, chattering crowds. The family silently bearing the large sunflower had never been to the fair before. But this was important. They finally located the entry table, and asked for a form. They carefully filled it out. Their flower was entered in the seed head category -- the one that judges the largest seed head, which is the circular area in the middle of a sunflower. They wrote down the name of the person who had grown the sunflower: . Wyatt Wilke. He was their 7-year-old son. He had died earlier that same day, at a few minutes after midnight. Now, less than 10 hours later, here they were, with Wyatt's flower. ""He loved growing his sunflowers,"" said his mother, Cathleen Wilke. ""Every year we talked about coming into La Porte for the Sunflower Fair, but we never got around to it. Wyatt really wanted to be part of the contest."" That's what they had planned -- a day at the fair, to enter his sunflower. He was a healthy, constantly laughing boy -- he loved school, where he was in the second grade, he loved horses, he loved his big brother John, with whom he shared a bedroom. The Wilkes lived in the tiny town of Hamlet, about 15 minutes from La Porte; Wyatt would look out the back window, watching for blue jays and cardinals. ""He planted his sunflowers in our garden,"" Cathleen Wilke said. ""He was so careful with them. A few weeks before the fair, there was a heavy windstorm that knocked his biggest sunflower over. He called to me: 'Mom, it's on the ground -- my flower, it's down.' He was afraid it was ruined. But he managed to save it."" The week before the fair, Wyatt wasn't feeling well in class -- he had a sore throat. The school called on a Wednesday. He came home. ""But the next morning, he was up, and he wanted to go to school,"" his mother said. ""He was always so responsible -- he said, 'I didn't get my homework done last night.' I told him that was all right, that the school would understand. But as I made him his toast, he sat there on the couch, doing his homework."" She told him he really shouldn't go to school. He stayed home. That day, he seemed to get sicker and sicker. ""We drove over to the hospital in South Bend that night,"" his mother said. ""He was talking in the car. As sick as he was, he said to us: 'Mom and Dad, when are we going to get to go camping?' There was this big, round, moon in the sky, and he looked out the window of the car and told us to look at it. He said the moon was so beautiful."" At the hospital, they knew he was in very bad shape. Wyatt, it would turn out, had contracted an overwhelming bacterial infection that had entered his bloodstream and that was attacking his organs. He was in the hospital that Thursday night and all day and all evening Friday. His body went into septic shock; it couldn't fight off the infection. Friday turned to Saturday. His life ended just as the new day began. ""He had always told us he wanted to grow up to be a Marine,"" his mother said. ""Then he said he wanted to be a doctor. So we told him he could be a Marine doctor."" And now they were at the hospital, and at age 7, he was gone. Someone remembered: This was going to be the day of the Sunflower Fair. How they found the strength to do it is hard to conceive. But that morning, carrying Wyatt's favorite sunflower -- the one he had saved when the wind had knocked it down -- they were at the fair in La Porte. They waited together as all the categories were judged. No one around them had any idea. And then, through the loudspeaker system at the fair, the winner of his category was announced: . ""First place. . .Wyatt Wilke."" The judging committee looked around, waiting for the winner to come forward and accept his trophy. His family. . . . Well, you can imagine. ""I don't even remember which one of us went up to accept it for him,"" his mother said. ""But Wyatt had won. He had won."" That was a year ago. A few months later, the fair's organizer, Phyllis Jones, approached Cathleen Wilke and asked her if she would like to serve on the committee. She said yes. And this year at the fair, the contest -- all the categories, the whole competition -- had a new name: . The Wyatt Wilke Sunflower Contest. The seeds from Wyatt's winning flower were given to his classmates at Kingsford Heights Elementary School. The children planted them in the school's new memorial garden, the one that is named for Wyatt. The sunflowers are blooming now. Soon enough winter will arrive, and the snow will cover Indiana. But the seeds will be planted in the school's garden every year, and forever the flowers will return, bright and vibrant and full of life's very best promise, like the smile of a boy who believes he can do anything. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","A boy in Indiana saved his prized sunflower after a windstorm .

"(CNN) -- Shailene Woodley isn't just the lead actress in ""The Fault In Our Stars."" She's one of the book's original fans. Long before she landed the role of Hazel Grace, a bright 16-year-old facing cancer, she sent the novel's author, John Green, an impassioned, lengthy e-mail rallying for ""The Fault In Our Stars"" to become a movie. ""I didn't say I needed to be Hazel,"" Woodley said at the movie's New York premiere on June 2. ""I said I needed this movie to get made. Because I knew that it would change the lives of millions of people."" If the movie version of ""The Fault In Our Stars"" is anything like the book, Woodley will soon be proven right. The adaptation, now in theaters, is faithful to its beloved source material, which chronicles the romance between two cancer patients with humor, intelligence and honesty. Author Green had already amassed a fan base when ""The Fault In Our Stars"" was released as a novel in January 2012, one devoted enough to earn him the title of ""The Teen Whisperer."" But ""The Fault In Our Stars"" has stretched far beyond its intended young adult demographic, selling millions of copies and sticking to The New York Times Young Adult best-seller list for 78 weeks. Young adult books and sex: What we learned under the covers . Time magazine didn't name it ""The Best YA Novel of 2012""; it recognized it as the year's best book, period, the kind of endorsement Woodley could get behind. The 22-year-old actress, who is developing a reputation for pushing back against Hollywood's rules, recently explained to New York Magazine the impact she thinks ""Fault In Our Stars"" could have. ""In 'Fault,' I am trying to rewrite what a female lead can look like,"" Woodley said. ""You've never seen a woman on the poster for a movie with a cannula in her nose."" Although Woodley said she wasn't gunning for the role of Hazel when she wrote Green, the author remembers that exchange a bit differently. ""The letter was extremely long, like 40 pages long, and ... I didn't technically know who Shailene Woodley was,"" he said. ""So I just responded like, 'That's such a lovely e-mail! Thank you so much! But I am not a casting director.' And then when I saw her audition, of course I was horrified that I had not written her back and said, like, 'Please! Please! Be in our movie!'"" Of course it's unlikely that Green, who calls Woodley ""a gift"" to the film, would have had to beg. Woodley, who's gone from ABC Family's ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"" to high-profile projects like ""The Descendants"" and ""Divergent"" in the blink of an eye, was game for the role, chopping off her long hair to accommodate the part. In the process, she gained something as well: ""a deeper sense of gratitude"" for life. ""On this beautiful day, there's kids at home in bed hooked up to chemo machines,"" Woodley reflected at the movie's June 2 premiere. ""There's no way to justify it. So, really, it taught me a deeper sense of gratitude and a deeper sense of appreciation for these small palpable moments, because they're the only thing that we're guaranteed."" CNN's Joan Yeam contributed to this report.","Shailene Woodley wanted to see ""Fault In Our Stars"" made into a movie .

"(CNN) -- At least 30 people were killed and 42 injured Sunday when a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest attacked a mosque south of Baghdad, according to police and health officials. The mosque is located in al-Musayab, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of the capital. The attack targeted Shiite mourners, who were at the mosque for a funeral. Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Sunnis, who represent a minority of Iraqis, have felt politically marginalized since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Shiites, who make up a majority of Iraqis, now dominate the government. In a separate incident Sunday, at least 12 people were killed in an attack on the security headquarters of the regional Kurdish government in Erbil. A suicide bomber in a minibus attempted to enter the facility. Kurdish security forces opened fire, and the vehicle exploded.

"(CNN) -- NASCAR driver Tony Stewart won't face charges in connection with the on-track death of sprint car racer Kevin Ward Jr., a New York district attorney announced Wednesday. Stewart, a three-time NASCAR top series champion, was driving a dirt-track car when the right rear tire hit Ward, who was walking on the track as cars slowly circled during a break in an Empire Super Sprints series race August 9 in Canandaigua, New York. Ward, 20, died of massive blunt trauma before paramedics could get him to a hospital. The Ontario County District Attorney said a grand jury found no reason to charge Stewart. ""After listening to and questioning all the witnesses and reviewing all of the evidence, the grand jury has decided that there is no evidence to charge Tony Stewart with any crimes,"" District Attorney Michael Tantillo told reporters. He said he thought the fact that Ward came down the track into an area where cars were still moving played a big factor in the grand jury's decision. The 23 members of the Ontario County grand jury heard testimony for almost two days from more than two dozen witnesses and reviewed photos and two videos before making their decision, Tantillo added. They took about an hour to deliberate, he said. ""While the process was long and emotionally difficult, it allowed for all the facts of the accident to be identified and known,"" Stewart said through a press release. ""While much of the attention has been on me, it's important to remember a young man lost his life. Kevin Ward Jr.'s family and friends will always be in my thoughts and prayers."" Ward, who exited his car after he and Stewart were involved in a racing incident that left Ward's car wrecked near the top wall of the track, was under the influence of marijuana that night, the district attorney said. ""The levels that were determined were enough to impair his judgment,"" Tantillo said, citing toxicology evidence. Ward's family indicated it might pursue a civil case and said Stewart was to blame for the accident. ""Our son got out of his car during a caution, while the race was suspended,"" the family said in a written statement. ""All other vehicles were reducing speed and not accelerating except for Tony Stewart, who intentionally tried to intimidate Kevin by accelerating and sliding his car towards him causing this tragedy. The focus should be on actions of Mr. Stewart and not Kevin. This matter is not at rest and we will pursue all remedies in fairness to Kevin."" After Ward exited his car, he stormed down the track, apparently to confront Stewart. One car avoided hitting Ward but as Stewart passed close by his tire struck Ward, slinging him down the track. The videos showed Stewart drove a ""pretty straight"" course until he hit Ward, Tantillo said. ""The videos did not demonstrate any aberrational driving by Tony Stewart until the point of impact with Kevin Ward, at which point his vehicle veered to the right up the track as a result of the collision,"" the district attorney said. Stewart could have faced charges of second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide. He was interviewed the night of the race by a certified drug recognition expert who determined Stewart wasn't under the influence. ""There are no winners in tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Kevin Ward Jr. family and Tony Stewart as they all cope with this tragic incident at Canandaigua Motorsports Park,"" NASCAR spokesman Brett Jewkes said in a written statement. ""This has been a difficult time for everyone involved and we have respected the local authorities responsible for reviewing this case."" CNN's Christie Bear, Rob Frehse and Jill Martin contributed to this report.","Family of Kevin Ward Jr. still blames Stewart, indicates might pursue other legal options .

"(CNN) -- Michael Dunn will stand trial for the shooting of Jordan Davis -- again. When a Jacksonville jury failed to reach a verdict on the first-degree murder charge last February, they gave Florida State Attorney Angela Corey the opportunity for a do-over, and she's taking it. Jury selection for the retrial begins September 22. It was Angela Corey's prosecutors that I faced as a defense lawyer during the George Zimmerman trial last year -- a case with social themes echoed by the Dunn trial. While the first jury hung on the murder charge involving Davis' death, they did hand down a guilty verdict on three counts of attempted second-degree murder in the firing of shots at Davis' companions. The minimum mandatory sentence will be 60 years, which, for a 47-year-old man, is a life sentence. So if Michael Dunn, who had complained about the volume of music coming from Davis' SUV, is already sentenced to life in prison, why bother with another trial? Because it's the prosecutor's prerogative. We've charged prosecutors with the authority to look at cases and to prosecute those they believe can result in a conviction, based upon the facts and the applicable law. We expect prosecutors to move forward with all viable cases, not just the ones they like. In that sense, if Angela Corey feels her case is strong enough to get a conviction, pursuing the case is not just her right; it's her obligation. To a prosecutor, a hung jury could be a signal that a case is still winnable, or that, having put on their best case, they couldn't convince a jury of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecutors have taken the time to polish and focus their witnesses' testimony, or reframe opening and closing arguments, or adjust the presentation of evidence (and they will certainly do all of these things), then they may get a different result. Perhaps the real message the hung jury sent was ""try harder."" Angela Corey, as an elected official, may have other motivations for moving forward with a retrial. The Dunn case unquestionably has social and political overtones as it is one of several recent cases where a young, unarmed black man has been killed. For many, the Dunn case raises civil rights issues -- and some feel a decisive verdict in this case will have broader implications. Retrial: Did Michael Dunn kill Jordan Davis out of fear? Or loud music? And if Corey is politically motivated in retrying the Dunn case, it will not be the first time, in my view. Corey's decision to waive a grand jury and charge George Zimmerman with second-degree murder during an election year was politically expedient -- especially by a politician who wanted to placate her black constituents. But she promised a conviction she could never deliver. A victory in the Dunn case would give Corey a chance to rehabilitate her image with constituents who actively call for her resignation -- especially in light of allegations that she disproportionately overcharges African American defendants (notably her aggressive handling of the Cristian Fernandez and Marissa Alexander cases). An acquittal would also have impact. But the jury -- if it's a fair and impartial jury -- won't concern themselves with the politics of the case. They'll be asked to render a verdict based upon only the evidence presented in court, and they'll be asked to set aside other factors, such as the broader social considerations. They will have one job: to determine whether the state proves, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Michael Dunn did not have reasonable fear of imminent great bodily harm when he fired the shots that took Jordan Davis' life. Essentially, the trial will be asking the jury to peer into Michael Dunn's heart and determine if they see hatred or if they see fear. Hatred yields a conviction; fear justifies an acquittal. I don't know what they'll find, but here's what I hope: I hope Michael Dunn gets a fair trial. I hope there is an impartial jury. If there is a conviction, I hope Jordan Davis' family can find some closure. If there is an acquittal, I hope it is not interpreted as a blow to civil rights. No matter what the verdict, I know it will rekindle a national conversation about race, guns, and self-defense -- a conversation that started with the Zimmerman case and rages on in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. My fear is that we place so much significance on a particular case that we base all our hopes on a certain outcome. Not getting the desired result then causes a natural recoil away from speaking about the underlying, more significant issues of the undeniable racial divide that still exists like a virus in our country. My hope is that, regardless of the verdict in Dunn, and regardless of the result in Ferguson, we can find a way to augment a constructive conversation about the true nature of America's racial divide, a conversation that gives us the courage and understanding to do something about it together. Fault does not rest solely on one side of the divide or the other; rather, it is a national problem, and will only be resolved if we face it, and conquer it, as a nation.","Michael Dunn is being retried on murder charges after conviction on attempted murder .

"Siwa, Egypt (CNN) -- The journey to the Siwa Oasis isn't enjoyable. Hours are spent in a car covering hundreds of kilometers of flat, barren desert. If you're not careful, you can easily fall prey to boredom and passenger's fatigue. The first signs of the approaching oasis are red and white buttes rising from the sand that break the monotony of the landscape. Entering Siwa is like Dorothy opening her door to Oz. Two large saltwater lakes fed by fresh water springs dominate the oasis, surrounded by a forest of date and fruit trees. In photos: Siwa Oasis . Three barren hills -- home to the Oracle of Siwa, the Mountain of the Dead and the old town -- loom above the sea of green foliage. Donkey carts seem to outnumber cars on the road in this sleepy part of Egypt. The only place to stay and truly experience everything the oasis has to offer is at one of the eco lodges. Getting over the initial impact of living without electricity will be uncomfortable, at first. At Siwa Oasis, you'll need to break the addiction of Internet, cellphones, and television. But eventually a primitive human instinct kicks in, and a new level of relaxation takes hold. Watch: Egypt wants tourists back . We stayed at the Adrere Amellal Ecolodge, which sits on the far west end of the oasis straddling Siwa Lake and the Sahara Desert. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because there isn't any power you'll have to slum it. The rooms are built in the traditional Siwa fashion, but with all the amenities of a five-star hotel, including hot water. Step outside your room and prepare for an adventure. With only three full days I was limited in what I could explore. But I especially enjoyed taking a dip in the pool fed by a natural spring. Then, I floated on the lake that, to my surprise, is just like the Dead Sea. Sturdy horses take travelers into the Sahara to watch the sun rise above the oasis and later that day, sink behind large dunes of the Great Sand Sea. Speaking of sand: If you're interested in sandboarding, make sure to check the boards first. The sandboard I used had an exposed screw on the bottom, which acted like an anchor going down the slopes. Our desert guide, Abdullah Baghi, was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. While out exploring the fossils, we discovered what Baghi believes are fragments of a meteor. We couldn't be sure, seeing neither of us are meteor experts or geologists. You can enjoy a Siwa sand bath if you're brave enough to make the journey in the middle of summer. The average temperature is 38 degrees Celsius (or 100 degrees Fahrenheit). If you take the plunge, you are buried up to your neck in scorching sand, which allegedly helps with rheumatism, high cholesterol, and other ailments. For 10 to 15 minutes the moisture is pulled out of your body, after which they dig you up. Apparently the stench remaining in the pit once someone leaves is pungent. If you're looking for a bit of adventure without a guide, bicycles are available to rent so you can discover the back roads of the enormous oasis. While out discovering its nooks and crannies, you might want to stop off at Cleopatra's Spring. Rumor has it, the Egyptian queen visited and swam there -- but historians dispute this claim. Back at the hotel, the amazing staff is ready to serve. The meals alone are an event. Every multi-course meal is presented at a different location on the lodge's grounds. Dinner is under a ceiling of shining stars and illuminated by candlelight. After spending five years in Egypt and dining in most of Cairo's restaurants, I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, they serve the best food in the country. If you're lucky, the owner of the lodge, Dr. Mounir Neamatalla, will join you for dinner. He's a truly enlightened man with incredible knowledge of not only Siwa, but of Egypt as a whole, and makes for great conversation. Later in the evening, lanterns illuminate the pathways around the grounds, some of which lead to a roaring fire. In my opinion, sitting by the fire with a good drink is the best way to relax and rejuvenate after a long day. Part of what makes this oasis so magical is the difficulty in traveling there. Only dedicated, serious travelers make the journey -- not your run-of-the-mill beach bum. If you decide to hop in a car or bus and travel the grueling hours, I can guarantee you will not be disappointed.","Siwa Oasis is one of Egypt's most isolated settlements .

"(CNN) -- When Tony Blair heard British aid worker David Haines mention the former prime minister prior to his beheading, it strengthened his resolve to fight ISIS, he said Sunday. ""It makes me even more determined to take these people on and beat them,"" Blair said in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Before his execution this month, Haines directed a message at British Prime Minister David Cameron, saying, ""You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British Prime Ministers who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans."" It's not clear whether Haines' comments were voluntary or were coerced by his captors. In his Sunday interview, Blair said he felt President Barack Obama is ""absolutely right to take on ISIS and build the broadest possible coalition."" He said, however, that aerial campaigns won't be enough and ISIS will need to be fought ""on the ground,"" but it's unclear whether the Iraqi and Kurdish fighters already battling ISIS will be sufficient or if they'll need to be supplemented. He did not specify who might need to provide troops, saying the plan to battle the terrorist group will ""evolve over time."" Asked why some British citizens had opted to join ISIS, Blair said it wasn't just a British problem but a European one. He also emphasized that the ideology espoused by those who fight alongside ISIS is abhorrent to most Muslims. ""The broad mass of the Muslim community in the UK will be absolutely horrified and appalled by this and condemn it completely,"" he said. ""The way these hostages are abused and subject to the grotesque form of public parade and then execution, it's just horrific. It's evil and it's totally contrary to the principles of any form of religious faith."" Britons who adhere to this ideology have been subjected to a perversion of Islam that must be stamped out not only in Britain, but in the Middle East and Africa, Blair said. It was a familiar tack for the former prime minister, who said in an April speech that it was absurd that the United Kingdom spends billions on defense to protect itself from ""the consequences of an ideology"" that is being taught formally and informally in countries ""with whom we have intimate security and defense relationships."" At that time, Blair suggested raising the level of international dialogue to force countries to effect changes within their own societies. It's not solely about the horrendous death toll from ""religiously inspired conflict,"" he said, but ""quite apart from the actual loss of life, there is the loss of life opportunities for parts of the population mired in backward thinking and reactionary attitudes, especially towards girls."" In Sunday's interview, Blair said Britons were not joining ISIS because they'd been mistreated in the UK but because they'd been exposed to this radical ideology. ""It's an ideology based in a complete perversion of the proper faith of Islam, but it is powerful. It is proselytized and preached by people in mosques and madrasas not just in countries like Pakistan and parts of the Middle East and parts of Africa, but back in parts of Britain,"" he said. ""How do you root this kind of teaching out and make it absolutely clear that it is completely unacceptable to teach these forms of extremism?"" he asked. Blair did not expand his remarks on Haines or offer thoughts on aid worker Alan Henning, who appeared in the video of Haines' execution, but he said ISIS' treatment of its hostages shows why it's so important to win the fight against the group. The recent broadcast of executions demonstrates ""how completely divorced from any type of proper human compassion these people are, and why it's also necessary to take them on and beat them."" Terrorist attacks span East and West, he said, citing incidents in Uganda, Kenya, Somalia, Thailand, Australia, Nigeria and Yemen, and thus require a ""global response"" rather than a response only from the West or the West and a few Arab states. Even countries like Russia, China and India can find common ground with the United States on dealing with the threat, Blair said, adding that cooperating with Russia to battle extremism should not ""impinge on how we view Russian attitude toward Ukraine.""","Hearing his name in execution video strengthened Tony Blair's resolve to defeat ISIS, he says .

"(CNN) -- In February 1990, the same month that Nelson Mandela, also known as Madiba, walked free after 27 years behind bars, South Africa's then-President, Frederik Willem de Klerk, issued written instructions to dismantle the nation's atomic arsenal. Like Madiba's achingly long incarceration, the apartheid regime's development of these most abominable weapons, though never officially acknowledged, had become an intolerable blight on South Africa's image abroad. Divesting ourselves of the bomb was -- as de Klerk later remarked -- an essential part of our transition from a pariah state to an accepted member of the family of nations. In his time as president, from 1994 to 1999, Madiba frequently implored the remaining nuclear powers to follow South Africa's lead in relinquishing nuclear weapons. All of humanity would be better off, he reasoned, if we lived free from the threat of a nuclear conflagration, the effects of which would be catastrophic. Addressing the U.N. General Assembly in 1998, he said: ""We must ask the question, which might sound naive to those who have elaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusal to eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of mass destruction -- why do they need them anyway?"" Despite Madiba's undisputed moral authority and unmatched powers of persuasion, his cri de coeur for disarmament went unheeded in his lifetime. South Africa, to this day, remains the only nation to have built nuclear weapons and then done away with them altogether. Nine nations still cling firmly to these ghastly instruments of terror, believing, paradoxically, that by threatening to obliterate others they are maintaining the peace. Quite unaccountably, all are squandering precious resources, human and material, on programs to modernize and upgrade their arsenals -- an egregious theft from the world's poor. Madiba attributed the lack of progress in achieving total nuclear disarmament to ""Cold War inertia and an attachment to the use of the threat of brute force to assert the primacy of some states over others."" To his mind, the struggle against the bomb was intertwined, inextricably, with the struggles to end racism and colonialism. He abhorred the double standard, deeply entrenched in today's international order, whereby certain nations claim a ""right"" to possess nuclear arms -- in the hundreds, even the thousands -- while simultaneously condemning, and feigning moral outrage towards, those who dare pursue the same. We must vociferously challenge the perceived entitlement of a select few nations to possess the bomb. As Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. Secretary-General, put it succinctly in January of last year: ""There are no right hands for wrong weapons."" But how do we uproot the discriminatory order? How do we end the minority rule? In our decades-long fight against apartheid in South Africa, we depended upon the combination of an irrepressible domestic groundswell of popular opposition to the regime and intense and sustained pressure from the international community. The same combination is needed now in the movement to abolish nuclear weapons. This week, in the Mexican state of Nayarit, ministers and diplomats from three-quarters of all nations -- those not coming include the Permanent Five members of the U.N. Security Council, the U.S., UK, France, Russia and China -- are gathered to discuss the devastating humanitarian impact of nuclear detonations. This will cover the inability of emergency workers to provide relief to the wounded; the widespread dispersal of radiation; the lofting of millions of tonnes of soot from firestorms high into the upper troposphere; the collapse of global agriculture from lack of sunlight and rainfall; the onset of famine and disease on a scale never before witnessed. This conference is not only a much-needed reminder of what nuclear weapons do to humans beings -- something seldom mentioned in arms control discussions -- but also a vital chance for the international community to chart a new course. It is high time for the nuclear-free nations of the world, constituting the overwhelming majority, to work together to exert their extraordinary collective influence. Without delay, they should embark on a process to negotiate a global treaty banning the use, manufacture and possession of nuclear weapons -- whether or not the nuclear-armed nations are prepared to join them. Why should these weapons, whose effects are the most grievous of all, remain the only weapons of mass destruction not expressly prohibited under international law? By stigmatizing the bomb -- as well as those who possess it -- we can build tremendous pressure for disarmament. As Madiba understood well, a world freed of nuclear arms will be a freer world for all. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Desmond Tutu.","The month Mandela left prison, South Africa's president ordered its atomic arsenal dismantled .

"(CNN) -- You may have heard of yoga's ""downward-facing dog"" pose, but what about ""upward-staring horse""? Well, that's sort of the idea at one animal school in Argentina. A video of a wrangler performing yoga-esque poses atop a strapping steed went viral on the internet earlier this year, bringing predictable headlines like ""You'll neigh-ver believe it"" and ""Horse yoga is actually a thing!"" But the practice turns out to be not quite the same ancient Indus Valley art that such reports have suggested. Instead, it owes its formation to the indigenous communities of rural Argentina, in which horses have played an integral, almost mystical role for centuries. According to Cristabal Scarpati, co-founder of the Doma India school in the town of San Luis, these impressive skills have been honed and passed down through tribes, towns and settlements in the region for generations. ""The philosophy of our school is the philosophy that my father learned from an old Indian named Don Cristobal Luna,"" Scarpati told CNN.""He taught us how to recreate these exercises practiced by the Indian aborigines. ""These people were endowed with extraordinary abilities and very often the survival of their tribes depended on them. It was also a way for cawelche (tribal horse experts) to display their union with the animals and show off their skills."" On the film, a man can be seen stretching a horse's legs before carefully performing a headstand on its chest. He then maneuvers the horse onto its side, soothing it into a trance like state of relaxation. It's an oddly enchanting sight, displaying the controlled movement and calmness that many who have dabbled in the practice of yoga or meditation will recognize. ""For many years I traveled the world bringing this message and what we can say is that horses -- regardless of race or color or origin -- are all susceptible to the same stimuli ... like affection, empathy, respect and solidarity,"" Scarpati said. ""I've never done yoga but now people tell me a little about it I actually think there are many points of connection,"" he added on the similarities of the concepts. ""The pursuit of harmony, peace of mind and body health are closely intertwined in both activities. I think the suggestion is quite correct."" Thousands lose sleep over horse's birth . Doma India primarily exists to teach owners about the mental state of horses and to help tame horses that are troublesome, untrusting or insecure. However, the school also aims to help people meditate or seek an inner calm through the experiences and interactions they can have with horses. ""The horse can actually produce a calming effect on people,"" Scarpati said. ""I sincerely believe that we can enjoy something very similar to yoga if we encourage people to play with horses and if we dare to truly connect with them on their frequency in the frequency of nature."" With that in mind, maybe the upward-staring horse pose isn't so far fetched after all. See also: Thoroughbred therapy on Cape Town coast .

"(CNN) --  A U.S. destroyer is shadowing a ship off the coast of Somalia after it was taken over by 50 pirates, authorities said. The M/V Iceberg was identified last week after the USS McFaul conducted a 36-hour surveillance mission, the multi-national Combined Maritime Forces said in a statement. The USS McFaul began shadowing the Panamanian-flagged vessel May 19 before the M/V Iceberg reversed course and began heading toward the Somali coast. ""We cannot be sure what the pirates' plan was if they had not been interrupted,"" said Rear Adm. Beom Rim Lee, commander of the Combined Maritime Forces task force. ""The vessel may have been on its way to either assist other pirates in distress, or look for another merchant vessel to attack,"" he said. The M/V Iceberg was last been seen off the coast of the Somali town of Garacaad, a known pirate haven, but its exact location was unknown until USS McFaul positively identified it. ""Further investigation showed the name of the ship had been crudely painted over"" in an effort to disguise it, which caused confusion in identifying it, the Combined Maritime Forces statement said. The USS McFaul had initially requested to board the ship to check on the crew. The M/V Iceberg denied it had been taken over, saying it was having mechanical difficulties. Eventually, crew members radioed back saying they had been taken hostage by heavily armed pirates, officials said. The M/V Iceberg has a crew of 24 from Yemen, India, Ghana, Sudan, Pakistan and the Philippines, officials said. Cmdr. Ronald W. Toland, Jr., commanding officer of USS McFaul, said he tried to ensure the safety of the crew first. ""Given the report of heavily armed pirates on board, it was more prudent to monitor the ship's movement, rather than attempt a rescue,"" he said.","Destroyer USS McFaul followed Panamanian vessel as it headed toward Somalia .

In 2012 the organization tested more than 85,000 15-year-olds in 44 countries and economies on their problem solving skills, testing their ability to explore limitations or obstacles and to understand information given to them. While Singapore, Japan, China and Korea were among the top-performing economies, the United States scored just above the average and Russia and Israel lagged behind with lower-than-average scores. The OECD says ability to crack complex problems is key to the economic success in the future. ""Today's 15-year-olds with poor problem-solving skills will become tomorrow's adults struggling to find or keep a good job,"" said Andreas Schleicher, acting director of education and skills at the OECD. The problems in the test were designed to be similar to those faced by many workers in every day situations -- such as using an unfamiliar mobile phone or a ticket-vending machine. The report says one in 10 workers faces such hurdles every day. But the skills become even more important in the sectors that drive developed economies -- highly skilled managerial and technical occupations. The pupils were also asked to consider situations involving a number of alternatives and constraints to make a decision -- for example choosing the right pain killer given sufficient details about the patient, their complaints and the available pain killers. In another parts, students had to solve scheduling problems for projects such as building a house or generating a flight schedule for an airline. One question asked the children to plan a seating plan for a birthday party according to the wishes of the individual party guests. Try to solve it here: . (See the answers here.) The results suggested that one in five students in the OECD countries is only able to solve ""very straightforward problems -- if any -- provided they refer to familiar situations, such as choosing from a catalog of furniture, showing different brands and prices, the cheapest models to furnish a room."" But the same students failed when put in new situations and asked to solve unfamiliar problems. The report says this is a consequence of education focused on various sets of rules, such as the rules of algebra. While algebra is important, the reports points out that in real world, applying the rules of mathematics is only the second part of finding a solution to a problem. ""The first step -- the step computers can't do -- involves examining the messy set of facts in a real-world problem to determine which set of algebraic rules to apply,"" it says. To avoid turning pupils into robots governed by a strict set of rules, teachers should encourage their students to think about skills they learned in one class -- such as reading and mathematics, and apply them when trying to solve a problem in biology or history.

"Pinar del Rio, Cuba (CNN) -- On Yosvany Concepcion's ramshackle farm, there is little to suggest that he is producing a highly sought-after luxury item. The buildings on the farm look like a strong wind could carry them away. There is virtually no machinery. But Concepcion grows the tobacco leaves that are transformed into Cuban cigars. And much of the allure of these legendary, expensive cigars is that they are still made entirely by hand and in places, like Concepcion's farm, that seem trapped in time. ""As you can see, we do things the traditional way,"" Concepcion said, gesturing to the barn where green tobacco leaves are hung to dry before being rolled into cigars. He and the rest of Cuba's tobacco farmers might soon have their work cut out for them. Executives from Habanos, the Cuban-British joint venture that distributes Cuban cigars, announced at their annual festival last week that sales were up over 9% in 2011. That growth, executives said, could indicate that the market for luxury goods is rebounding despite a still-shaky world economy. The festival was also bursting at the seams, with 1,500 attendees from 60 countries paying top dollar to taste Cuba's best smokes. ""Things are going well,"" said Rodrigo Malmierca DÃ­az, Cuba's trade and foreign finance minister, as he toured the festival in Havana. ""The cigar has been appreciated since Columbus landed here. And it will continue to be, because they are very good."" As good as they might be, Cuban cigars are illegal in the United States because of the U.S. trade embargo with Cuba. ""The embargo is something that affects everyone,"" said Jorge Luis Fernandez Maique, co-president of Habanos. ""It affects us as a country, as a business, and it affects the American consumer. They can't buy directly from Cuba, so they have no way of knowing if they are buying genuine Cuban cigars."" Many of the Cuban cigars that are available on the black market in the U.S. are probably fakes, cigar experts say. Cuba is also awash in knockoffs. Tourists on the island receive near-constant offers from peddlers selling imitations at prices far below what the government stores sells genuine cigars for. ""Smoke a fake cigar, and you will not find the right blend,"" said Ana Lopez, Habanos' director of marketing. ""You are going to find something totally different, and probably (you) will be disappointed."" Cigar makers responded last week by unveiling security measures, such as holograms and serial numbers, on the labels of some premium brands. ""We have included a number of security elements into the band which makes them unique and impossible to copy,"" said Henk Nota, president of Vrijdag Premium Printing. Cigar distributor Angela Giannoulis has traveled from Canada more than 10 times to attend the Habanos festival. She said she is brought back by her love of cigars and desire to stay up to date on the industry. ""You get to try stuff before anyone else, so that's a nice perk,"" she said. ""And it's people united by the same passion. You can smoke anywhere, you can get them fresh out of a roller's hands. It really is an art to be appreciated.""","Hundreds of people from across the world visit Cuba every year for its annual cigar festival .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A diver searching the sunken Sewol ferry died Tuesday, according to South Korea's Government Rescue Headquarters. ""A civilian diver, Lee, lost the communication line at 25 meters under the sea five minutes into his first dive,"" spokesman Koh Myung-suk said. ""By the time his colleagues went to save him, Lee was unconscious and unable to breathe by himself,"" Koh said. Lee, whose full name was not provided, was helicoptered to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, the spokesman added. Park In-ho, head of the hospital where Lee died, said the diver's blood was tested and appeared normal except for high potassium. His chest X-ray also showed no sign of irregularity. Not including the diver, the death toll in the ferry disaster has risen to 264, with 38 people still missing, the government reported. Over the weekend, South Korean President Park Geun-hye visited the port where the rescue operation is based to console families and encourage divers. Nearly 130 divers are combing the ship, looking for the remaining missing bodies. The search-and-rescue operation has turned into a grueling recovery of corpses. No one has been found alive since the ferry sank April 16 with a passenger load largely made up of high school students on a field trip. The work has become even more difficult because divers have faced closed cabin doors blocked by debris. Corralling the debris has been difficult for search teams. Mattresses and clothing from the ship have been found up to 9 miles (15 km) away from the accident site, said Park Seung-ki, a spokesman for the rescue operation. Large stow and trawler nets will be set up around the sunken ship to catch items that may float away, he said. At the same time, some three dozen ships will be clearing an oil spill from the ferry, which is threatening the livelihood of the local fishermen. The ferry sank en route from Incheon to the resort island of Jeju, off the nation's southwestern coast.

"(CNN) -- Amid British tabloid reports over the weekend that celebrity chef Nigella Lawson was grabbed around the neck by her husband, Charles Saatchi, London police said Monday that a man accepted a warning related to the case. London's Metropolitan Police say a 70-year-old man ""accepted a caution for assault"" at a police station on Monday afternoon. Police did not name the man, but several UK media outlets named him as Saatchi. ""Officers from the community safety unit at Westminster were aware of the Sunday People article which published on Sunday 16th June and carried out an investigation,"" a Metropolitan Police spokesman told CNN. ""This afternoon Monday 17th June, a 70-year-old man voluntarily attended a central London police station and accepted a caution for assault,"" the spokesman said. CNN contacted Saatchi's company for comment but has not received a response. According to a UK government website, a caution is issued for minor crimes. Opinion: The rich and famous are not immune to domestic abuse . ""Cautions are given to adults aged 18 or over for minor crimes - eg writing graffiti on a bus shelter,"" the website says. ""You have to admit an offence and agree to be cautioned. If you don't agree, you can be arrested and charged. ""A caution is not a criminal conviction, but it could be used as evidence of bad character if you go to court for another crime."" Sunday People, part of the stable of tabloids published by the Mirror Group, published the photos Sunday of Lawson and Saatchi at a restaurant. The tabloid's website includes the caption: ""Nigella Lawson attacked in public by Charles Saatchi."" Earlier a representative for Lawson confirmed that the chef and her children had moved out of their home. Saatchi also denied the reports of an attack in another British newspaper. ""About a week ago, we were sitting outside a restaurant having an intense debate about the children, and I held Nigella's neck repeatedly while attempting to emphasize my point,"" Saatchi, an art dealer and former advertising mogul, told The Evening Standard. ""There was no grip, it was a playful tiff. The pictures are horrific but give a far more drastic and violent impression of what took place. Nigella's tears were because we both hate arguing, not because she had been hurt,"" he added. ""We had made up by the time we were home. The paparazzi were congregated outside our house after the story broke yesterday morning, so I told Nigella to take the kids off till the dust settled."" The restaurant involved told CNN that its employees did not witness any such incident. Lawson's Facebook page is filled with messages from fans expressing their support for her. Lawson is known as the ""queen of food porn."" She has written numerous successful cookbooks and hosted TV shows. Watch a CNN interview with Nigella Lawson .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cubans will be allowed to work for themselves in 178 activities in the private sector and even hire employees, according to guidelines published Friday as the communist government moves quickly to shed half a million state jobs and provide alternatives for workers. Cubans will be permitted to be self-employed carpenters, restaurateurs, barbers and even salsa dancers. Many of the categories already existed, but the government hadn't granted new licenses for years, which meant that the total number of self-employed people in Cuba's 5.1 million-strong workforce was just 143,000. The new list of occupations published in state media includes seven new categories, among them accountants and bathroom attendants. It also says that for the first time in decades, these private entrepreneurs will be allowed to hire nonrelatives and access credit. The measures are aimed at ""raising levels of productivity and efficiency,"" according to state-run newspaper Granma, and eliminating the social ""stigma"" long associated with self-employment in the socialist system. Last week, Cuba announced it would eliminate ""at least"" 500,000 state jobs, or 10 percent of the public sector workforce, over the next six months and pave the way for more private enterprise. This is the most dramatic move yet by President Raul Castro to reshape the country's sputtering economy, but he insists the socialist system will not be altered. The announcement got mixed reactions from Cubans. Some are concerned that a way of life ­ and a guaranteed fixed income ­are disappearing. Others are optimistic that they will be able to make more money in the private sector. The average state salary is just $20 a month. But many details, like how much these entrepreneurs will have to pay in taxes, social security and licensing fees, are still missing. State media said more details would be soon be unveiled.","Cubans can work for themselves in 178 activities .

"(CNN) -- Eleven health researchers received $3 million each Wednesday from a new foundation set up by some of the tech world's heaviest hittters. That's twice as much money as a Nobel Prize pays. And, according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the once-in-a-lifetime payout isn't even the most important part. ""This prize isn't really about the people who are winning it today,"" Zuckerberg told CNN's Ali Velshi shortly after the Breakthrough Prize Foundation handed out its first of what are planned to be annual awards. ""It's the college and graduate students who are in the lab trying to figure out what they should be researching. It's about younger kids trying to figure out what they want to be when they grow up."" Zuckerberg has teamed up with tech heavyweights like Google co-founder Sergey Brin and Apple board Chairman Art Levinson to launch the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. On Wednesday, an inaugural class received the prizes for their work in research ""aimed at curing intractable diseases and extending human life."" ""Society has a lot of heroes for a lot of different things, but we don't have enough heroes who are scientists and researchers and engineers,"" Zuckerberg told CNN. ""We're just trying to set up this ... to reward and recognize the amazing stuff these folks are doing."" Levinson, the former CEO of biotechnology company Genentech, will serve as chairman of the foundation's board. ""I believe this new prize will shine a light on the extraordinary achievements of the outstanding minds in the field of life sciences, enhance medical innovation, and ultimately become a platform for recognizing future discoveries,"" he said in a written statement. The founding sponsors -- Brin and wife Anne Wojcicki, Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan, and Russian entrepreneur and venture capitalist Yuri Milner -- have committed to funding five $3 million prizes every year going forward. Each prize winner will join the selection committee for future recipients. Wojciciki, founder of health-and-ancestry genetics company 23andMe, said that while the Nobel often recognizes scientists whose work has been widely applauded, she hopes the Breakthrough Prize will herald those whose less-visible work leads to similarly grand results. ""We want to get people in the life sciences to think big, take risks and recognize there's a major reward that could come their way,"" she told Velshi. The prize's first 11 recipients are: Cornelia I. Bargmann, David Botstein, Lewis C. Cantley, Hans Clevers, Napoleone Ferrara, Titia de Lange, Eric S. Lander, Charles L. Sawyers, Bert Vogelstein, Robert A. Weinberg and Shinya Yamanaka.","Tech bigwigs team up to create Breakthrough Prize for scientists .

"(CNN) -- The United States is at a strategic inflection point. The choices we make now will have an enormous effect on our national security for decades. The war in Iraq has ended, and we have begun a transition in Afghanistan that will lead to a smaller American commitment in 2014 and beyond. On the horizon, we can see the end of a decade of war. But as we look to the future, a very different but still daunting set of challenges confronts us: The rise of China and shifting power dynamics in Asia; the unfolding promise and perils of the Arab Spring; Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability and the risks of conflict and proliferation it could spark; the near demise of al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan and the emergence of dangerous regional affiliates in places such as Yemen; growing cyberthreats and new technologies and operational concepts that are transforming warfare. Even more daunting, we must address these challenges at a time of severe budgetary austerity and profound political paralysis. After more than a decade of deficit spending, mounting national debt and the global financial crisis, we must shore up the U.S. economy as the foundation of our prosperity and security. This will require hard choices to bring government spending and revenues into balance while still investing in the long-term drivers of U.S. economic competitiveness. Republicans and Democrats have been unable to reach consensus on how to make these hard choices, bringing Congress to a standstill. The super committee's failure to reach agreement on deficit reduction highlighted another more worrisome deficit -- one of political courage, vision and classic American pragmatism. These qualities are sorely needed at a time when partisan ideological discipline seems to have trumped the other nobler forms of discipline that have made this country great. In this context, Americans must decide what kind of military we need for the future. The 2011 Budget Control Act requires the Department of Defense to reduce its expenditures by about $487 billion over the next decade, $259 billion of which must be cut over the next five years. In practical terms, this means the base defense budget will be about 9% smaller than planned, while spending on overseas contingency operations also declines. In order to determine how best to sustain America's global leadership in this time of austerity, the Obama administration conducted a defense review based on four key principles: . First, the United States must maintain the world's finest military, one that supports and sustains our unique leadership role in the world. Second, the Defense Department must avoid the mistakes of past drawdowns, which have resulted in a ""hollow force."" A smaller, ready and well-equipped military is preferable to a larger force without adequate investment in readiness and modernization. Third, everything must be on the table, including politically sensitive areas that will likely provoke opposition from some members of Congress, industry and advocacy groups. There can be no sacred cows. Fourth, we must preserve the quality of our all-volunteer force and keep faith with our men and women in uniform and their families, particularly after a decade of such great sacrifice on their part. These principles shaped the Defense Department's FY13 defense budget request, which envisions a smaller force that is highly flexible, agile and -- above all -- ready to conduct the full spectrum of missions. Importantly, the review called for a strategic rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific, the region that will have the greatest impact on U.S. economic and security interests long term. This does not mean taking our eye off the ball in the Middle East or turning our back on allies in Europe. It does mean increasing our presence, access and partnerships in Asia, particularly Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. It also means increasing investment in capabilities that can ensure U.S. power projection in contested environments and protecting low-cost, high-impact programs that build the capacity of critical partners in other regions to address shared challenges. At the same time, the Defense Department is protecting investment in areas critical to the future, including: Special Operations Forces; unmanned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; cybersecurity; counter-WMD measures; and long-range precision strike. Great care was also taken to ensure that the U.S. military will remain able to deal effectively with aggression in more than one theater at a time. This standard has long been a pillar of American strategy and is essential for a global power with global interests, let alone the world's indisputable leader and ally of choice. Nevertheless, the United States will no longer size its ground forces for sustained, large-scale counterinsurgency and stability operations. Both the Army and the Marine Corps had to grow over the past decade to sustain multiple rotations to Iraq and Afghanistan. As this decade of war winds down, these forces are being reset to be ready to respond to a wider range of scenarios. Lastly, the Defense Department has planned for ""reversibility"" -- that is, the ability to surge, regenerate and mobilize to counter any threat around the world. Given our poor track record in predicting past wars, we must be able to adjust quickly if and when we get it wrong. This concept is shaping the department's investment in areas ranging from the National Guard and Reserves, to the number of experienced leaders it retains, to the industrial base. In sum, this administration has put a smart, strategy-driven and fiscally responsible blueprint for the U.S. military on the table. Now, the onus is on the Congress to exercise the discipline, pragmatism and political courage to reach a budget deal that avoids sequestration and its devastating effects on our national security.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A former anti-drug czar in Mexico has been arrested on corruption charges in his home state of Chiapas, officials said. Mariano Francisco Herran Salvatti, who also was the attorney general in Chiapas for more than six years, is charged with embezzlement, criminal association and other acts of corruption, Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar said. ""In Chiapas, the validity of the law also means that the culture of privilege has passed and justice is applied equally to all,"" Lopez said on the Chiapas government Web page. Herran was arrested Saturday night in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, but Lopez did not announce the arrest until Sunday. The attorney general contends Herran committed the crimes while he served as secretary of economic development in Chiapas, a post he held from November 2007 until June. Officials are investigating irregularities involving 175 million pesos (about $12.5 million), Notimex said. Herran served as drug czar for President Ernesto Zedillo from 1997 to 2000. In that post, he was involved in the prosecution of more than 60 members of the Juarez drug cartel and the investigation that led to the 2001 arrest of former Quintana Roo Gov. Mario Villanueva Madrid for his connections to drug traffickers. Herran, a lawyer, served as attorney general in Chiapas from 2000 to 2006. He came under investigation in April on suspicion of violating the rights of 146 criminal suspects while he was attorney general and was fired as the economic development minister in June. He still faces prosecution on those charges. As drug czar in 1999, Herran and his wife escaped an assassination attempt when gunmen on motorcycles fired on his car in Mexico City. A bodyguard and one of the gunmen were wounded in a shootout. He is not the first former drug czar to face charges. Noe Ramirez Mandujano, who was the nation's top anti-drug official from 2006 until August 2008, was arrested in November on charges he accepted $450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers. Ramirez was accused of meeting with members of a drug cartel while he was in office and providing information on investigations in exchange for the bribes, Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora Icaza said at the time. Ramirez's arrest came as part of an ongoing investigation called Operation Limpieza, or Operation Cleanup, that targets officials who may have passed information to drug cartels. Herran's predecessor as drug czar, Jose de Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was fired in 1997 after an investigation revealed he had received payments from the Juarez drug cartel.","Mariano Francisco Herran Salvatti facing corruption charges .

"(CNN) -- Here's a question for die-hard ""Game of Thrones"" fans. Is your reaction to newly launched tours of ""Game of Thrones"" filming locations a) tittering fanjoy at the thought of seeing King's Landing in real life, or b) uneasy fear that touring the modern day castle without a sadistic boy-king inside it would impede your suspension of disbelief? Either way, beginning this summer, devotees of topless fantasy, medieval bloodlust, flayings, dragons, direwolves, White Walkers and Peter Dinklage will be able to visit locations used in the filming of the epic HBO series. San Francisco-based online travel company Viator has announced the launch of two ""Game of Thrones"" tours, one in Dubrovnik, Croatia, the other in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The cities and surrounding areas serve as settings for fictional locales depicted in the series. 10 of the best medieval walled cities . Dating to the seventh century, the walled city of Dubrovnik serves as the official setting of King's Landing, capital of the Seven Kingdoms. Highlights of the three-hour Dubrovnik walking tour include the ancient city walls and 11th century Lovrijenac Fortress, where battle scenes, including Stannis Baratheon's Battle of the Blackwater at King's Landing, were filmed. Belfast tour sites . The nine-hour Belfast tour (an epic in itself) takes in sites around Northern Ireland, including the caves where red priestess Melisandre of Asshai gave birth to an evil shadow-baby assassin, and Ballycastle, setting for the Free Cities where the eunuch Lord Varys was born as a slave. The tour continues to Dark Hedges, where Ned Stark's fierce, tomboy daughter Arya reinvented herself as a boy, then moves on to Lordsport Harbour, where unlucky traitor Theon Greyjoy returned to his homeland of the Iron Islands. Also included is Downhill Strand, the real world setting for Dragonstone, where Melisandre burned the Seven Idols of Westeros on the beach as an offering to her Lord of Light. Hanging out in Hobbiton: The Hobbit's stunning movie set . The Belfast tour also throws in locations that haven't been featured in the show but are iconic in themselves, such as the Giant's Causeway. ""Movie and TV-themed tours have always been popular on Viator.com -- 'Harry Potter,' 'Downton Abbey' and 'Sex and the City,' to name a few,"" says Viator spokesperson Kate Sullivan, adding that the company began taking bookings shortly after the new tours were announced. ""Given the popularity of 'Game of Thrones,' not to mention the amazing backdrops provided by the shows' filming locations, we knew these would be very well received."" The tours are operated independently of the show. Viator says its guides will be completely fluent in all things Thrones, meaning it may be worth taking a tour if only to get a credible explanation of just exactly what the hell is going on in the show. ""Game of Thrones"" Walking Tour of Dubrovnik departs daily at 10:15 a.m. from Dubrovnik Old Town and costs start at $72 for adults, $36 for children. ""Game of Thrones"" and Giant's Causeway Tour departs at 9 a.m. (minivan pickups arranged from various central Belfast hotels) and costs start at $110 per person.","Online travel company Viator launches two ""Game of Thrones"" tours .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has acknowledged that a number of its websites have fallen victim to attack by hackers following a mass campaign by the Anonymous network. Hackers belonging to the global band of online activists this week claimed to have compromised almost 500 sites belonging to the Chinese government, organizations and businesses. The cyber attackers plastered the sites with subversive messages, condemning what they described as Beijing's ""evil regime"" and warning ""Your government has been in control of your network and filters harmful things. Careful."" While official news sites in China made no mention of the hacking claims, the matter was raised at a briefing of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thursday. In a three-part answer, spokesman Hong Lei said that ""certain reports prove again"" that Chinese sites had been hacked. ""First of all, China's Internet is open to all, users enjoy total freedom online. China has gained 500 million netizens and 300 million bloggers in a very short period of time, which shows the attraction and openness of China's Internet,"" Hong said. ""Secondly, the Chinese government manages the Internet according to law and regulations. Thirdly, certain reports prove again that China is a victim of internet hacker attacks."" On Friday, searches for comments on hacking yielded re-posts of the MoFA statement: ""we have an open, free cyberspace in China.'"" One user on the Weibo micro-blogging site posted in response: ""Open? How dare you brainwash your people that?"" The mass attack comes less than a week after the country suspended comments on China's most popular micro-blogging sites, Sina's Weibo and Tencent's QQ. The two-day suspension was necessary to ""clean up rumors and other illegal information spread through microbloggings,"" according to state-run news service Xinhua. Authorities also closed 16 websites and detained six people for allegedly spreading rumors of ""military vehicles entering Beijing and something wrong going on in Beijing,"" a spokesperson for the State Internet Information Office told Xinhua. China's internet was rife with rumors last month of an alleged coup attempt after the shock dismissal Communist Party politburo member and Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai. Cyberspace discussions on Bo's fate have since been censored. News of the Anonymous attack in China was spread on Twitter through @AnonymousChina, a relatively new account with less than 3,000 followers at the time of writing. Its first tweet was posted on March 30 and linked to a Chinese website with the words ""Hacked by Anonymous."" A list of nearly 500 sites allegedly hacked were posted on pastebin. Tweets suggested some were targeted more than once, including the CBD site of Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan province in the country's south west -- @AnonymousChina: ""http://cdcbd.gov.cn/ http://www.qnwqdj.gov.cn/ http://www.bbdj.gov.cn/ redefaced lol, your security still suck."" At the time of writing, no posts had been made on the Twitter feed for some 12 hours. While Xinhua did not carry news of the alleged Anonymous hackings, it has reported on their activities in the past. In February, it reported that the group had taken down the websites of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Alabama state government. Soon after that attack, top members of Anonymous and its offshoots were arrested and charged after a wide-ranging investigation that was assisted by a group leader working as a secret government informant. The FBI informant, ""Sabu,"" was a part of the elite AntiSec hackers. In recent years, Anonymous has been involved in some of the most high-profile cyberattacks on the Web -- hobbling the websites of governments and businesses, hacking into sites to reveal private data and, along the way, getting dubbed cyberterrorists by authorities in the United States and elsewhere. The network's motto is ""We are Legion,"" and it describes itself as ""a decentralized network of individuals focused on promoting access to information, free speech, and transparency."" CNN's Shao Tian contributed to this report.","China acknowledges hacker attack on Chinese websites .

"(CNN) -- Not knowing exactly where my ancestors come from has always bothered me. I know my grandparents were born in the United States and believe my great-grandparents were too, but beyond that my family tree is pretty bare. Adding some leaves and figuring out my family's origins have been on my life ""to do"" list for a few decades now and while I still need to do the work, I'm heartened to learn a little bit more about the cousins I never knew I had. You see, I'm related to President Barack Obama, Albert Einstein, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and even my fellow CNN colleague Chris Cuomo, co-host of ""New Day."" Really, I am. The credit for learning about my new-found family connections goes to best-selling author A.J. Jacobs, the guy who lived life according to the Bible for a year for his book ""The Year of Living Biblically"" and tried every imaginable diet and workout for another book, ""Drop Dead Healthy."" He's now trying to build a family tree of the entire world (and stage the world's biggest family reunion -- more on that later). His inspiration, he says, came from an email from a man who said he was Jacobs' 12th cousin. ""I was a little bit creeped out,"" Jacobs joked during an interview. ""But then it turned out he really was. He had a family tree of 80,000 people on it."" Jacobs, an editor at large for Esquire magazine and a father of three, said he became obsessed with genealogy, playing around on sites such as Geni.com, WikiTree.com and FamilySearch.com, which he says have ""megamonster family trees"" with millions of people on them. He's also interviewed hundreds of people -- from scientists to genealogists to statisticians -- and is working with hundreds of volunteers to create the world's family tree and track down his own cousins. He learned he's related to celebrities (Gwyneth Paltrow, Olivia Wilde), current and former presidents (Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush), and even a wizard. OK, not a real wizard exactly. ""A.J. Jacobs is my cousin, and I'm his cousin, and we are probably cousins,"" said Daniel Radcliffe of ""Harry Potter"" fame in a video for Jacobs' project. (Side note: If my daughters learn we're related to ""Harry Potter,"" they will fully expect an invitation to Hogwarts!) (To find out who you are related to, head to GlobalFamilyReunion.com and try to have the names and approximate birth dates of your grandparents and the names of any semi-famous relatives and ancestors handy!) Jacobs likes to show how some of the people you would never imagine are related actually are. For example, he points to Obama and his 44 cousins in the U.S. Senate, including Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the biggest critics in the Congress of the Obama administration. Cruz is actually the husband of the President's 14th cousin once removed. ""Wonder how they'll take the news?"" I asked Jacobs. ""I'm hoping it would nudge people to be a little more open-minded,"" he said, admitting to being slightly idealistic. ""I don't think it's going to cause world peace to break out, but I think it will help. It can't hurt."" Now will the Obamas invite the Cruzes for Christmas dinner? And will they invite my family since we are related to the Obamas, too? ""I just love the fact you can take any two people, any two people on the street ... and see how they're related,"" said Jacobs, declining to speculate on whether we'll actually get a holiday invitation from the first family. ""And it drives home this extraordinary fact that we all do come from the same ancestors."" ""We are all one big family."" In that spirit, Jacobs is planning what he calls a Global Family Reunion for June 6, 2015, in New York City. Tell your first and second and third cousins and beyond, because Jacobs is trying to break the Guinness Book of World Records when it comes to family reunions. The current record is 4,514, he said. ""I'm shooting for at least 5,000 at my family reunion."" I asked Jacobs if he's worried that the current record holder, a family in France, might get wind of his project and try to top it. ""Listen I am very inclusive. I welcome the competition,"" he said. ""I want my reunion to have satellite reunions around the world. Maybe they can have their reunion at the same time. I've got to give them a call."" Jacobs' effort to hold the largest family reunion ever will be the subject of a book he's writing. The documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, host of CNN's '""Inside Man,"" is also making a movie about it. All proceeds from the Global Family Reunion will go to fight Alzheimer's, a disease that ""affects 60 million members of the human family,"" he said. There is one downside to the ""we are all related"" concept, he conceded. Let's just say it can get uncomfortable at times, such as when you marry your cousin. ""It did happen to me,"" said Jacobs. He and his wife did DNA testing using the site 23andMe.com and learned they are cousins -- not second or third cousins but distant cousins nonetheless. ""I think it adds a little spice to the marriage,"" said Jacobs with a smile, which seemed to imply that I might stop laughing once he told me more. ""I am sorry to say you are married to your cousin as well,"" he said. ""You married your cousin, so did everybody watching."" Oh my! Would you attend the Global Family Reunion? Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","Best-selling author A.J. Jacobs is trying to build a family tree of the entire world .

"(CNN) -- I am a mother of three, and my views on guns have evolved significantly over the course of my lifetime. My husband hunts and believes strongly in his right to bear arms. But when my 25-year-old son, Peter, shot himself in a moment of despair in April 2012, I came full circle to a harsh reality: There are almost twice as many suicides as murders by firearm across America, roughly 19,000 of the 30,000 gun deaths each year. Yet we disproportionately fear and almost exclusively talk of criminals in the national gun debate. My introduction to guns came on a hot summer day in 1963. My father, 53, sent us all out of the house to have an afternoon of fun at a swimming pool. He called police, wrote ""I'm sorry"" on a scrap of paper, and shot himself in our basement. My dad had recently lost his job. Not knowing how he would support his family, he had calculated how much his life insurance policies would pay upon his death. It was enough for my mother to raise the five of us, between the ages of 5 and 15 at the time. Related: A mother's journey to bearing arms . I vividly recall the carefree joy of that day in the sun, which was shattered by numbness, confusion, shock, grief and shame. The world felt much less safe from that day on. Fifteen years later, I became a naval officer to support myself and so I would never be a financial burden on anyone. I qualified as a marksman on an M-16 rifle, felt the kick of firing a .45-caliber handgun and visited the pistol range many times to shoot a friend's .38-caliber revolver. I was not afraid of guns. When my sons were still small, I got rid of my handgun because I was more afraid for them than for myself. I recalled my co-worker's experience: Her son's friend was accidentally shot in her garage when another youngster brought a gun over, unbeknownst to any adults. Marine to senator: I won't 'register my weapons' All three of my smart, athletic sons grew up to graduate from college and find good-paying jobs. In the summer of 2011, my middle son bought a house just outside of Baltimore with his then-girlfriend of five years. As he often did, Peter followed his older brother's lead, buying a handgun for protection and target shooting. He developed a fascination with weapons and bought a rifle and a sword, too, all ""tools"" designed to kill. When Peter proudly showed me his new handgun, I spoke to him about my father's suicide by gun almost 50 years earlier -- the pain and sorrow it caused and the fear for him it now raised in me. I advised him that numerous, reliable studies showed that his gun was more likely to be used against a member of his own household than on anyone else. He expressed surprise at this information. Having said my piece, I dismissed my fears, satisfied that ""forewarned is forearmed."" Ten months later, I knew Peter was unhappy with his job, but none of us close to him ever imagined he was so despondent. He called in sick to work one Friday, wrote me and his fiancee notes of love and apology, walked to the woods, called police and shot himself in the head. He left his driver's license with its red heart for organ donation next to him. A dozen people received his last gifts, half of which saved lives. Our love affair with guns in this country needs to be tempered with a healthy dose of respect for all the dangers of ownership. I support the right of individuals to make informed decisions about whether and how to keep a gun in their house. Parents defend right to keep guns in the home . Given the number of guns already out there, alerting owners to the heightened risks and steps to reduce those risks seems wiser than speaking of getting rid of them. That just throws up a furious wall of opposition from gun owners. Determined to spare other parents this horrific experience, I have studied much of the research related to suicide and firearms. It's a myth that without a gun handy, people bent on killing themselves will just find another way. For many, the suicidal crisis is temporary, and 90% of those who survive an attempt do not go on to die by suicide. Any obstacle or delay can break the self-destructive trance. Guns are extremely lethal as a means of suicide. Very few survive a self-inflicted gunshot wound to get a second chance at life. Protecting your family from this risk means getting rid of or locking up your guns. Having a gun in your home at least doubles the risk of suicide for all who live there. Gun safes, trigger locks and separate ammo storage can reduce, but not eliminate, that increased risk. Think twice about giving adolescents or any troubled family member unsupervised access to deadly weapons, no matter how much safety training they've had. Mental health treatment has not made a dent in suicide statistics, but reducing access to the most lethal methods can drastically lower overall suicide and murder rates. Many of us face moments of overwhelming despair, whether mentally ill or not. The vast majority of us get past these dark thoughts and learn to cope with the trials of life. Though guns lack intent, they are suggestive of death. The mere presence of this most lethal tool actually influences the suicidal person's decision by making death too easy, quick and certain. My hope is that people will recognize the very real threat of suicide, know that it is preventable, and act to keep guns out of reach. If you suspect that anyone in your family might be suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, please get the gun out of the house or change the combination or the key before it's too late. While we at CNN are not trained to offer you the best guidance on what to do right now if you are considering suicide, we are concerned for your safety and would like to direct you to someone who may be able to help. The trained counselors at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline are available 24/7 by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255). The call is free and confidential.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's moderate former president will not challenge President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the upcoming presidential election, the state-run Fars news agency said Monday. Mohammad Khatami, in a photo from February, will not run for president of Iran, the state news agency says. Mohammad Khatami said last month that he would run in June, ending weeks of speculation, the state-run IRNA news agency reported February 8. But he now says he will instead support moderate candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, Fars reported Monday. Moussavi is a former prime minister. Before Khatami declared his candidacy last month, he had said either he or Moussavi would run as the reformist candidate to challenge Ahmadinejad, a hardliner. Khatami said he will soon make an official statement regarding his withdrawal. Analysts said when Khatami announced his candidacy that he had the best chance as a reformist candidate to unseat the current president. Khatami overwhelmingly won the presidency in 1997, raising hopes that the reformist movement would bring religious and democratic freedoms to the Islamic republic. But the real power in Iran rests in the hands of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khatami, who left office in 2005, was unable to make major changes because of opposition from hardline elements in Iran's clerical establishment. In 2006, Khatami visited the United States, becoming the highest-ranking Iranian official to visit the country since the 1979 revolution that brought the Islamic government to power. He has condemned terrorism and said he regretted the taking of American hostages by Iranian students in support of the revolution. Meanwhile, Ahmadinejad has been campaigning for re-election since Day One of his presidency in 2005. His frequent and well-publicized visits to Iran's provinces are part of an effort to reach out to the Iranian people. He has doled out financial aid to the poor in his dozens of visits across the country and recently more than doubled the salaries of government employees and retirees' pensions. Ahmadinejad has the support of Iran's supreme leader and the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. But the downturn in the global economy -- particularly the falling price of oil -- could still hurt the incumbent president's chances for re-election and he may need a strong turnout at the polls to secure a victory. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Mohammad Khatami reportedly said last month he'd run in June elections .

"(CNN) -- The immigration debate in the United States should be guided by what is in the best interests of the United States. Take it from a fifth-generation American whose maternal ancestors have been in Texas since the Lone Star State was more commonly referred to as ""Northern Mexico."" Which means that Americans need to do everything they can to retain people such as Erika Andiola. We have to identify people like this 27-year-old undocumented immigrant from Mexico and find ways to allow them to remain in the only country they've ever known. We need more Erikas because the ""DREAMer"" -- who arrived in the United States when she was 11 and lives near Phoenix -- understands, better than many U.S.-born citizens, the responsibility to hold elected officials accountable regardless of what party they're in. Andiola is one of the most famous DREAMers in the country. In 2012, she appeared with nearly three dozen other undocumented immigrants -- including journalist Jose Antonio Vargas -- on the cover of Time magazine. In September 2013, she began an eye-opening adventure when she went to Washington to work for Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. She lasted four months. She left after concluding from conversations with other congressional aides that Democrats would prefer not to solve the immigration problem because they would rather use it a club to bludgeon Republicans. She wrote about her experience and observed that Washington was driven by ""political games -- games that are causing too much pain in our community."" She also declared that the immigrant community and the American people have more power to affect change than ""politicians inside the beltway."" Truth-telling won't make you popular. And for some in the immigrant advocacy movement, Andiola is now persona non grata. She is attacked on social media, and -- while she used to be a frequent guest at the White House for policy meetings on immigration -- she has recently been yanked out of line several times while waiting to enter for one event or another. Demanding results from Democratic elected officials can cost you friends among left-leaning activists who put their party before their cause. ""Unfortunately, a lot of immigration activists are Democrats,"" Andiola told me. ""As soon as anything comes out of their mouths, it's so biased."" Spot on. Such honest talk can get you labeled a ""Republican"" by partisans on the left. Especially if you're also turning up the heat on Latino Democrats in Congress, directly confronting them and demanding that they pressure the White House to pursue immigration reform. And especially if you're criticizing a Democratic president for racking up deportations. ""At this point, I wouldn't consider myself a Democrat or a Republican,"" Andiola said. ""Immigration has become such a political issue that neither party is doing anything about it."" Right again. The object of the game seems to be for both parties to look busy while doing nothing and then blame the other side for getting nothing done. Democrats want to use the issue to bludgeon Republicans, but they're also afraid of being seen as too sympathetic to illegal immigrants. It's an issue both parties wish would go away for another decade. Andiola has been an activist since 2010 when she pushed for the DREAM Act, which promised legal status to undocumented young people, and against the Arizona immigration law, which encouraged racial profiling. Now she is sick of politics. While she still supports a path to citizenship for the undocumented, she first wants an end to the deportations juggernaut that has wreaked havoc on so many families, including her own. The deportation issue eventually hit home for Erika. As a DREAMer, she has been granted a two-year work permit under the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. But while this protects her from being deported, that protection doesn't extend to her family. In January 2013, ICE agents stormed her mother's apartment and arrested her mother, Maria Arreola, and older brother, Heriberto. Erika mobilized her network, and her family was released -- though they still had to appear in court. In December 2013, Arreola was granted a temporary stay of deportation. For a 27-year-old, Andiola has had enough experiences to fill several lives. Yet, despite it all, she knows who she is -- even if the answer doesn't please everyone. In January 2013, she was being interviewed by Univision anchor and commentator Jorge Ramos about her mother's arrest. At the end of the interview, Ramos asked her: ""Que eres?"" (Who are you?) He wanted to know if she identified as a Mexican or North American or what. I could tell that Ramos was hoping she'd go with ""Mexican."" She didn't. ""I'm very proud of my culture and heritage,"" Andiola said. ""But I love this country. I think of myself as an American, a Mexican-American."" Told you. She's one of ours. Now if we can just get her to teach her fellow Americans how to be less partisan and hold both parties' feet to the fire, we might form a more perfect union.","Ruben Navarrette: We have to find ways to let the undocumented stay in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- For Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Ravens' firing of running back Ray Rice on Monday doesn't come close to addressing how the NFL deals with domestic violence. He said the league ""deserves special scrutiny"" for such matters. Blumenthal said he won't ""rule out"" Congressional involvement to pressure the NFL to alter its ""deep-seated fundamental far-reaching problem"" involving domestic abuse. The Connecticut Democrat, who has been a sharp critic of the NFL's handling of domestic violence issues, said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's leadership has been ""completely lacking,"" adding that it should not require recorded evidence to punish someone for abuse. As football season finished its opening weekend, Congress pounced on a variety of issues in addition to domestic abuse. Members of Congress are up in arms over NFL-imposed media blackouts of games and the league's tax-exempt status. While Congress hasn't done anything about it, it holds the league's antitrust exemption over its head to ensure the league stays in line. The NFL works to keep Congress at bay, too. Its political donations favor incumbents and are divided mostly equally between Republicans and Democrats. The NFL's lobbying activity spiked after 2006 to more than $1 million per year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. ""There's only one NFL, so by definition it gets special treatment,"" Blumenthal said. Reactions pour in . Lesson of Ray Rice case: Stop blaming victim .","Sen.

"(CNN) -- After Tuesday's unveiling of two new iPhones and a heavily anticipated smartwatch, Apple gave press and special guests (including models, fashion bloggers and Gwen Stefani) some supervised hands-on time with the gadgets. Here are our first impressions of the Apple Watch. This watch is still under construction . It appears Apple is still ironing out the details of its new smartwatch, which is scheduled to be available early next year. In the large white showroom Apple custom built for the event, rows of iPhone 6s and Apple Watches were on display. While everyone was welcome to pick up and test the phones, interaction with the watches was carefully controlled. The available demo units ran a prerecorded loop of screens and features, so there was no real testing of the touch screen, buttons, dials or user interface. Apple employees put them on people's wrists and removed them. (They wore working versions of the watch and demonstrated a few features.) The company is still mum on many of the device's specs, including memory, battery life and screen resolution. The exact differences between the low-, middle- and high-end watches are also still blurry. Behind the scenes, the company is likely rushing to iron out any issues with the entirely new operating system and hardware. It fits! One thing we can start judging is looks. Full disclosure: I have dainty wrists. I have tried on many smartwatches and, so far, the straps and watch faces have all been cartoonishly large and heavy. Apple has always focused heavily on the design of its products, and that legacy really shows with the Apple Watch. There are a surprising number of options. There are three versions of the square watch face, each with its own color selection (including an actual 18 karat gold enclosure). All are available in two sizes (the small is 38mm and the large is 42mm) and there are six strap styles. When I tried on the smaller size, it actually fit just like a somewhat oversized but normal watch. It seemed lightweight enough to wear all day and it was curved to be flush against my wrist (necessary for the heartbeat sensors on the back to work). The sportier plastic bands might be useful for workouts, but they look a little cheap. The nice metal and leather straps are on par with what you'd find on a similarly priced watch. At a glance, there is a chance someone might mistake an Apple Watch for a regular timepiece. Once you look closer, it's obvious the square screen is not a real watch face. No matter how cool the features, that could be a turn-off for many potential customers. A new shorthand . This is not a wrist phone. You can't write emails on it. If you want to have in-depth communications, you'll need to use your iPhone (don't worry, it's already in your pocket because you have to have it for many of the watch's features). The size of the watch face makes using a full keyboard hard if not impossible (no apps with a keyboard were shown, but that doesn't mean one can't pop up later). To communicate from your wrist, you dictate messages to the watch or use it as a walkie-talkie to chat with another Apple Watch wearer. Apple is really hoping people will choose to communicate using what it calls Digital Touch, a combination of drawings and vibrations. You can doodle with your fingertip, tap out a special series of vibrations or send your actual heartbeat. This shorthand could become the next Emoji, or it could be Apple's Poke: something fun people do for a while before forgetting about it. Apple CEO Tim Cook and other Apple employees repeatedly used the word ""intimate"" to describe the watch's communication features. Perhaps that's because only someone you know intimately will have any clue what you mean when you send a line drawing of an octopus and the bass line to ""Under Pressure."" Power struggles . Apple would not disclose the battery life of the watch. That could mean the company is trying to downplay the short battery life or that it is still working on the technical details and hopes to improve it before the release date. During a demo, an Apple employee said the company expected people to charge their watches every night. One way it saves power is by only turning on the display when you lift your wrist to glance at it. But it's still a full-color screen with multiple sensors. Without a major leap in battery technology, more than half a day is still a lot to hope for from a smartwatch. The device does not charge wirelessly. It needs to physically connect to a large circular charger that attaches via magnets to the back of the watch face, much like the current MacBook MagSafe cords do. That charger has a wire that plugs into a wall. It is an all new proprietary charger. While the magnets might make plugging the watch in ""easier in the dark"" as Apple promises, it also means adding yet another cord to your power strip. And if nightly charging is necessary, that means your charger goes on every overnight trip. Too soon to judge . There is still much we don't know about the Apple Watch. To make any reasonable guess about its fate, we would need to navigate the operating system, use the watch's touch screen (which differentiates between a tap and a push), and test the digital crown (a knob) on the side. Cook said the time was incredibly accurate, but how about the various fitness measurements and heartbeat? Then there's the demand question. Are consumers really clamoring for a notification screen, credit card and fitness tracker on their wrist, especially one that's dependent on having an iPhone nearby? Smartphones can do many of these exact same things (especially with the iPhone's improved fitness tracking features). After the legions of Apple fans and early adopters slip them on, will regular people swap out their Casio for an Apple Watch?","Apple's new smartwatches were on display at the company's press event on Tuesday .

On November 28, 2005, Boeing wrapped up the 23-year run of the single aisle 757 passenger airplane but says more than 1,030 of its 1,050 757s are still in service. Commercial airlines usually fit out these planes with at least 200 seats, but the Four Seasons Jet will have 52 in a 2-2 configuration. Around the world in 24 days . Four Seasons says it's already accepting reservations for trips in February, April and August. First up is ""Around the World,"" a 24-day, nine-destination trip that starts in Los Angeles and ends in London. The price is $119,000 per person and stops include Hawaii, Bora Bora, Sydney, Bali, northern Thailand, Mumbai and Istanbul. A shorter tour, called ""Backstage with the Arts,"" is a 16-day European trip in April through Paris, Lisbon, Milan, Istanbul, St. Petersburg and Prague. Each journey includes air travel and ground transportation, planned excursions, all meals, some drinks and accommodations -- only in Four Seasons properties, of course. In-flight staff will include a concierge to coordinate with local Four Seasons concierges in each destination. Is there a market for such an indulgence? In a 2014 report on the global business of luxury, the Boston Consulting Group said that today's ultra rich are looking for experiences out of the ordinary. ""Luxury experiences are by far the most powerful driver of luxury spending everywhere,"" said Jean-Marc BellaÃ¯che, a BCG senior partner and coauthor of the report. ""Collectively, they make up nearly $1 trillion of the annual global total. As older consumers realize that they have all the 'things' they want -- and as younger people favor experiences they can share with their friends -- consumers are spending more on everything from dining at five-star restaurants to exotic vacation travel."" Four Seasons has been offering similar private jet journeys via a chartered company since 2012. According to Gelb, they've been extremely popular, which encouraged the company to look for new ways to evolve. ""The Around the World trips continuously sold out, and often had waiting lists, underscoring how important this level of experience is to our guests,"" she told CNN. ""In fact, many of our travelers have booked more than one private jet trip with Four Seasons and some even have private jets of their own, but what they are seeking is an unforgettable adventure in the company of like-minded travelers, one that delivers the uncompromised luxury that is the hallmark of Four Seasons."" In terms of competition, luxury tour companies like Abercrombie & Kent, National Geographic Expeditions and Remote Lands offer similar journeys geared toward wealthy travelers looking for a bit of adventure. And the list of potential clients keeps growing. The number of ultra high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) across the world has ballooned by 59% since 2003, taking the number of people with more than US$30 million in assets to over 167,000 worldwide, according to global real estate firm Knight Frank's 2014 Wealth Report. The fastest growth has been seen in the Middle East, Latin America, Australasia and Africa.","Four Seasons' branded jet will begin around-the-world tours in 2015 .

"(CNN) -- Maybe you've seen the video by now -- the YouTube clip where a man drives through a neighborhood in Arkansas and films a lawn that seems to be burping oil. If not, you should check it out. Beware, though: I've had a hard time getting the 33-second snippet out of my head. It's not necessarily the scene, although that's part of it. For me, it's the smell. About halfway through the clip the videographer says, ""the smell is unbelievable."" That's not the liveliest description, to be sure. But those words were all it took to transport me back to a boat on the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 -- bobbing on what seemed to be an endless sea of oil after the BP spill. The air's acidic tang stuck in my nose and on my tongue. I remember taking a drink of water later that day, firmly back on the shore. It still tasted like gas. The Mayflower, Arkansas, spill is nothing compared to the Gulf disaster, of course. Fourteen ducks, two turtles and one muskrat were oiled as a result of the Friday spill, according to ExxonMobil. Two ducks died. About two-dozen homes were evacuated. The full toll of the Gulf Coast Oil Disaster (the news media started calling it that because ""spill"" wasn't big enough to be accurate) is still being tabulated, but the numbers are of another magnitude: 210 million gallons of oil, as well as 464 oiled sea turtles and 8,567 affected birds, many of them dead, according to an April 2012 report compiled by two federal agencies and five states. Both incidents, however, are pieces in a bigger puzzle. They highlight, once again, that America is addicted to fossil fuels and needs to invest more seriously and urgently in alternatives like wind, solar and nuclear. These events never seem to really stick in our collective memory. But they should. If they did, they would inform our decision-making. The way things work now, oil spills are seen by some politicians as expected -- as externalities of our condition, like lung cancer to a smoker. U.S. Rep. Tim Griffin, an Arkansas Republican, reportedly told a local radio station on Wednesday that we have oil pipeline accidents ""just like we have car accidents"" and that he supports further development of the system that caused the spill in his state. How silly, right? We shouldn't expect oil spills to be part of modern reality. There are much better ways forward. Environmental groups are right to use the Arkansas spill as a cautionary tale -- as one of many reasons that the Obama administration should reject a proposed pipeline, called the Keystone XL, which would carry this risky type of crude from Canada to the Gulf Coast of the United States for processing. The connection isn't immediately clear, but the Exxon Pegasus pipeline that leaked in Arkansas was carrying the same type of ""oil sands"" crude that the Keystone pipeline would. (Slight detour here, but who in their right mind names a dirty, underground pipeline after Pegasus, the mythical, flying horse? Hat tip to Salon's Sally Kohn for noticing that that name is probably the most Orwellian thing you'll come across all week.) This is oil that's mined in northern Alberta, Canada, with the help of some of the world's biggest trucks. The crude is squeezed out of huge chunks of strip-mined dirt, as opposed to drilled from pools of oil underground. The groups contend this thicker ""oil sands"" material is more corrosive to pipelines and therefore more dangerous to transport across the United States. The National Resource Defense Council, in a recent blog post, says oil sands crude also is transported at higher temperatures, putting additional stress on pipelines; and it's thicker and harder to clean up than conventional crude. Business groups say the material is not more corrosive, citing a report commissioned by the Canadian Energy Pipelines Association. Those debates, however, obscure the more obvious point: We should be turning our attention -- and should have turned it long ago -- away from oil and toward greener options. Regardless of how they are transported, fossil fuels contribute to climate change when they're burned. And we can't afford to keep relying on them so heavily. But there seems to be little change of course under way. We're using newer, riskier technologies to extract the last of the Earth's hardest-to-get fossil fuels. That's true of old pipelines carrying new, more environmentally questionable types of crude from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. It's true of natural gas ""fracking,"" where liquid is injected into the ground to dislodge gas from cracks in the rock. The practice has raised concerns about possible links to earthquakes and potential groundwater contamination. And it's true of drilling in the deep ocean, which, as the 2010 disaster in the Gulf of Mexico showed, we obviously haven't figured out quite yet. To create an era of sustainable, clean energy, we need to pay more attention to spills like the one in Arkansas and the one in the Gulf. These events should stick in our noses and on our tongues. It took a YouTube video to remind me of that. I hope it grabs your attention, too. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","An Arkansas oil pipeline on Friday spewed crude into a neighborhood .

"(CNN) -- Could your smartphone really give you a lethal electric shock? That question was on the minds of many Monday amid news that Apple is investigating the death of a woman in China whose family said she was electrocuted after answering a call on her iPhone while the device was recharging. The death of Ma Ailun, 23, was first reported Sunday by China's Xinhua News Agency. Citing police reports and social media posts by Ma's family, Xinhua reported that Ma, who lived in China's western Xinjiang region, collapsed to the floor Thursday after using her iPhone 5 while the battery was being charged. ""We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic incident and offer our condolences to the Ma family. We will fully investigate and cooperate with authorities in this matter,"" Apple said in a statement sent to CNN and other news agencies. Details of Ma's death remain sketchy. Local police confirmed that Ma died of electrocution, but as of Sunday had yet to verify that her phone was involved in the incident, Xinhua reported. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. But the news raises questions about the potential electrical hazards of devices many of us carry at almost all times. Experts say the likelihood of someone being electrocuted by a smartphone, even while the device is charging, is very, very low. For one, phones charged from a USB cord have a supply voltage of about 5 volts, not enough to severely harm a person. ""We have seen very few incidents related to shock or electrocution (involving cell phones),"" said Scott Wolfson, communications director for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. ""Most of our attention has been on overheating, smoke or fire."" But the risks become greater when someone powers a phone with a substandard or incompatible charger. Some knockoff chargers don't have proper insulation, potentially exposing users to overheating, fire or electric shock. In a recent online post, the China Consumers Association warned about that country's market being flooded with counterfeit chargers that could potentially turn a phone into a ""grenade."" ""Stick to the company that made your phone when you're buying replacement products,"" Wolfson said. It's not clear what kind of charger Ma was using, although her sister said she had bought her phone in December at an official Apple store and was using the original charger to recharge the device when the incident occurred, according to a post on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site that is similar to Twitter. Mixing smartphones with water is another safety concern. Ma's family said online that she left the bath to answer the phone. Water is an excellent conductor of electricity, and moisture on the skin can lower a person's natural resistance to electric shock, experts say. Also, electrical shocks involving consumer electronics often have nothing to do with the devices themselves. Instead, they can be caused by overloaded power outlets, frayed extension cords or faulty wiring in a home, experts say. Wolfson said American consumers have reported a few isolated cases of phones smoking or catching fire while recharging. When it comes to cell phones and safety, the majority of problems have involved phone batteries that burst or catch fire under heat or pressure, he said. ""This is not the week to leave your cell phone in the car,"" said Wolfson, referring to the heat wave that's embroiled much of the country. Still, he said, ""it is a rare occurrence for there to be a safety incident with a cell phone.""","Incident in China raises concerns about smartphones and safety .

"(CNN) -- Hillsborough County, Florida, Deputy Kenneth Moon was alone at his station at a county jail facility near Tampa when an inmate attacked him with no warning. Moon, 64, was no match for Douglas Burden, 24, in custody on various drug charges. With Moon still in his chair, Burden put him in a choke hold and pulled tight. And then, surveillance video of the Monday attack showed, other inmates jumped into the fray. But the other inmates joined the fight on the guard's side, pulling Burden away from Moon and punching him in the head. One inmate grabbed Moon's radio and called for back-up. The inmates held Burden down until other guards arrived as one of them extended a hand to help Moon up, according to the video. Col. James Previtera, commander of Hillsborough County's Department of Detention Services, told reporters he believed that the inmates ""saved the deputy's life."" ""The response of the inmates in this case, I think, speaks volumes as to the fact that we treat these men and women ... in our facilities with a lot of respect,"" Previtera said.

"InStyle.com) -- The dark horse in a stampede of sun-kissed curls, Lucy Liu's ebony mane sets her apart from the typical Hollywood leading lady. ""Even if you don't have any makeup on, you can still look really pretty if your lips are soft and shiny."" ""My hair is so dark that I'd have to bleach it to add color, so I never dye it,"" she says. From long, sexy locks on Ally McBeal to razor-straight styles that whip around as she side-kicks and slices her way through Charlie's Angels and Kill Bill, Liu's hair practically plays a supporting role. This fall she returns to television as publishing exec Mia Mason on ABC's Cashmere Mafia. With a wavy bob (thanks to a grown-out perm), Liu, 38, embraces her girlier side. ""When my hair was longer, people didn't come up and talk to me,"" she says. ""Now they find me more approachable."" What's your earliest beauty memory? I used to watch my mom put makeup on, and we would go to the five-and-dime store and experiment with whatever makeup was there. It was basically L'Oréal lipstick -- which is funny, because I still use it. So is your mom your beauty guru? No, now she's coming to me for tips. She sees how amazing my makeup looks, but it's not me. It's the people putting it on. I really like to keep my skin clean. I use just a little concealer. I don't even put on sunscreen, but I don't sit in the sun either. No sunscreen! How do you keep your skin so young and smooth? I drink a lot of water, and I've never had coffee. I think caffeine can be really bad for your skin. And I don't get facials, ever. Why don't you get facials? I think they damage your skin. People are getting peels and dermabrasion, and anything with the word ""abrasion"" doesn't work for me. I also think a lot of plastic surgery hurts your skin. Do you always carry around two different eye liners? Yes. The liquid liner is for above the eye, and the pencil is for inside the eye. But I rarely use the pencil unless I'm going out. If you put liquid liner on during the day and then add pencil to the inner rims at night, it glams it up. What about your hair? How do you keep it so shiny? I alternate between Dr. Bronner's All in One soap, Davines and Prawduct for shampoo and different conditioners like Pantene. I love herbal scents because I'm a little bit allergic [to fragrance]. If I walk into a store and it's all perfume, it's too much. And I let my hair air dry. I rarely blow-dry -- I don't have time. You sound very low maintenance. Do you have any beauty indulgences? I splurge on acupuncture. It's preventative medicine: You go in once a month, and you get a little checkup so you're regulated. It keeps you healthy. My parents used to get acupuncture. It has been a part of my culture and my life for a long time, and it really, really works. It can help you lose weight, it can help your skin stay young -- and I've found it helps with jet lag. [Acupuncturists] look at your tongue and will say: ""All right, you're drinking too much"" or ""You're emotional, aren't you?"" How else do you stay healthy? Do you still practice martial arts? I just trained for the movies. But I love going hiking, and now because I'm [filming in New York City], I go biking. People can see me on the street -- I'm not biking that fast. It's just good exercise, and you get around quickly. It's like being on a horse or a motorcycle because you're outside. What about Aquaphor? I've heard you're obsessed. I use it for everything. It's not too glossy, so I wear it when I do movies because it looks really natural. I always carry a mini with me. And if I fall, which I do a lot -- I generally skid -- I'll put it on my [scrapes]. When I was shooting a movie in Montreal, it was freezing. If you take a little bit of Aquaphor and dab it on your face, it keeps your skin looking fresh. I dubbed it Aqua for Everything.

"(CNN) -- A former defense lawyer imprisoned for aiding a convicted terrorist's communication from prison to his terrorist group was released from prison Tuesday evening, after a judge ordered the ""compassionate release."" U.S. District Judge John Koeltl granted a motion filed by federal prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Prisons to reduce the sentence of outspoken lawyer Lynne Stewart, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2010. Stewart's ""terminal medical condition and very limited life expectancy constitute extraordinary and compelling reasons that warrant the requested reduction,"" Koeltl wrote in his order. ""... It is further ordered that the defendant shall be released from the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons as soon as her medical condition permits, the release plan is implemented and travel arrangements can be made."" Stewart arrived in New York early Wednesday afternoon and is with her son and his family in Brooklyn, according to her lawyer, Jill Shellow. ""I know that she is very happy to be home,"" said Shellow. ""I believe her immediate plan is to seek medical attention at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center."" Stewart, who is 74 and has breast cancer, was known for representing poor and sometimes unpopular clients as a defense attorney. In 1995, she represented the blind cleric Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was convicted of a long list of terrorist activities, including his part in a plot to blow up American military installations. Abdel-Rahman is serving life in prison. The motion filed Tuesday asked the court to release Stewart from a Texas prison because her cancer has metastasized to the lung and bone, and oncologists estimate her life expectancy to be less than 18 months. The filing said her medical condition was ""terminal and incurable"" and cited the ""relatively limited risk"" of recidivism and danger to the community from her release. Shellow told CNN her client's supporters were ""overjoyed that she will spend her remaining days with her family."" In 2000, Stewart broke her agreement to abide by measures set by the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons. Those measures stipulated that Abdel-Rahman not be permitted any contact with his organization, Islamic Group. After visiting Abdel-Rahman in prison, Stewart passed on a message from him to his Islamic Group followers: that Islamic Group should reconsider a cease-fire in attacks against the Egyptian government. Stewart was disbarred in 2007 and began serving her 28-month sentence in November 2009. In 2010, Koeltl revised his initial sentencing of Stewart from 28 months to 10 years in prison. Wearing navy blue prison garb and handcuffs, Stewart entered a crowded courtroom to a standing ovation. ""The pain is overwhelming"" said Stewart, who paused to compose herself several times while speaking. ""Prison has diminished me."" CNN's Morgan Winsor and Chelsea J.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Insane Clown Posse and four fans are suing the FBI for designating the rap duo's followers as gang members. FBI analysts, using law enforcement and media reports of crimes committed by people wearing ""Juggalo"" tattoos and clothing, concluded in the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment that they are a ""loosely organized hybrid gang."" ""Juggalos are a 'family' of people who love and help one another, enjoy one another's company, and bond over the music and a philosophy of life,"" said the lawsuit filed in Detroit Wednesday. ""Organized crime is by no means part of the Juggalo culture."" The gang designation violates fans' constitutional rights, including free speech, freedom of association and the right to due process, the complaint argues. People with ""Juggalo"" tattoos and clothing have been illegally targeted by police and denied jobs because of the FBI's gang designation, the complaint contends. ""Among the supporters of almost any group -- whether it be a band, sports team, university, political organization or religion -- there will be some people who violate the law. Inevitably, some will do so while sporting the group's logos or symbols,"" the filing said. ""However, it is wrong to designate the entire group of supporters as a criminal gang based on the acts of a few. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened here."" The group has been battling with the FBI in court since 2012 for the release of any information the analysts used to make their determination. Most of the documents released were online news stories detailing robberies and violence in which ""Juggalos"" were suspects. The Insane Clown Posse lawsuit claims that its followers identify with their songs, which ""have hopeful, life-affirming themes about the wonders of life and the support that Juggalos give to one another."" Insane Clown Posse: Hate us, don't hate the fans . ""Many people view Juggalos as nonconformists because of their musical tastes, their practice of painting their faces to look like clowns, and the distinctive Juggalo symbols -- including the 'hatchetman' logo -- that they often display on their clothing, jewelry, body art and bumper stickers,"" the suit said. ""Yet when Juggalos come together at concerts or their annual week-long gathering every summer, they know that they are in a community where all people are equal and where they will be accepted and respected for who they are."" The wide distribution of the gang report to law enforcement agencies around the United States ""has caused real harm to ordinary Juggalos from coast to coast."" The four fans who joined the lawsuit -- from Nevada, California, North Carolina and Iowa -- include a truck company owner who said he was detained by a state trooper in Tennessee because he was driving a truck with a ""Juggalo"" symbol on its side. Another man has been repeatedly stopped and questioned by California police because of his visible ""Juggalo"" tattoos, the suit said. A third fan was told by an Army recruiter that he could not join the military because of his ""Juggalo"" tattoo, it said. He was denied entry into the Army even after they were removed, the lawsuit said. The fourth plaintiff is an active-duty soldier with ""Juggalo"" tattoos. The gang designation ""places him in imminent danger of suffering discipline or an involuntary discharge from the Army,"" the lawsuit said. A Royal Oak, Michigan, theater canceled an Insane Clown Posse concert -- known as ""Hallowicked"" -- at the request of police, the suit said. The U.S. Justice Department has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit. ""We don't comment on pending litigation,"" FBI spokeswoman Jenny Shearer said when contacted by CNN. ""We're aware of the lawsuit,"" said Justice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle. ""We'll decline to comment.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Fourteen meters. It's the same height as a four-story building. Or three London double-decker buses. Or, if your imagination will stretch that far, two Tyrannosaurus Rexes standing on each other's shoulders. For Brazilian big wave hunter Maya Gabeira, it's also the size of a very different beast -- and one which she conquered with record-breaking skill and bravery in 2009. Four years ago, the fearless surfer rode a monster 14-meter wave in Cape Town, South Africa -- the biggest swell ever surfed by a woman. It's a feat that would make even the most experienced surfer quake in their boots. But in the notoriously male-dominated world of big wave surfing, this ballsy 26-year-old isn't just keeping up with the men -- she's giving them a run for their money. ""The adrenalin is a huge part of it,"" said Gabeira. ""It's the ocean at its strongest."" ""It's really unique to be able to be in harmony with that, to be part of that crazy moment out there riding the waves, when most harbors shut down and everyone goes to shore."" A wild ride . As the name suggests, big wave surfing isn't your average family-friendly pastime. Instead, it is a dangerous extreme sport, requiring hefty equipment, specialized training in underwater breathing, and nerves of steel. Riders are towed out to sea on jet skis, coming face-to-face with waves ranging from six-meters to 30-meters, with the possibility of plunging up to 15-meters below the surface if they come off their board. As 11-time world champion surfer Kelly Slater recently admitted, big wave surfing ""is a whole different ball game"" to normal surfing, which had claimed the lives of many of his friends. But for daring Gabeira, it's an obsession worth taking the risk for: ""It's such a rare process to get really big waves, for them to hit perfectly,"" she said. ""It's such a special moment that you live for. Whereas small waves you can surf everyday, they're always out there."" Young gun . Gabeira grew up in Rio de Janeiro, the daughter of radical Green Party politician Fernando Gabeira, who took part in the kidnap of U.S. ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick in the 1960s. She started surfing at 14, before moving to Australia and Hawaii in her late teens. At 18 Gabeira rode her first big wave in Hawaii, and admits that from that moment she was hooked. ""It was pretty nerve wracking,"" she said. ""I knew already that I wanted to do that, but when I actually did it for the first time, and felt like I had gotten in that level of big waves, I felt really addicted."" With her famous father, striking looks, and record-breaking rides, Gabeira has since become one of the best known female surfers in the world, winning the prestigious ESPY Award for Female Sports Athlete of the Year in 2009. Science of surf . For Gabiera, finding big waves has nothing to do with luck. It's a fine science, involving reading complex weather maps -- and being prepared to fly across the world with just a day's notice. ""Twenty years ago you had to be in Hawaii and spend six months of the year there, and when the swell came, the swell came, and you rode it,"" said Gabiera. ""Nowadays we have the internet and the forecasting and you get to choose where to go, when to go, and you get more opportunities to be in the right place at the right time."" As the technology behind predicting waves advances, so too does the equipment used to conquer them. Gabiera wears life jackets filled with oxygen cartridges, in case of emergencies. ""In case something happens, I can pull a cord which breaks open the tube of O2,"" explained Gabeira. ""It inflates on my back and I get lifted up -- hopefully."" Deep breaths . One of the biggest dangers Gabiera faces is being held under water for two or more consecutive waves. The gutsy surfer must be prepared to hold her breath for minutes at a time, doing free diving training exercises in preparation. ""I have a few great trainers who have taught me a lot about my breathing and how to exchange the CO2 and not blackout,"" said Gabeira. But ultimately for Gabeira, surfing is more than a sport -- it's art. ""It's self expression, everyone surfs differently, no wave is the same,"" she said. ""It takes me out of the real world and gives me a different perspective. It's just special.""","Brazilian surfer Maya Gabeira rode 14-meter wave, biggest for a female .

"(CNN) -- Comedian Tracy Morgan has been moved to a rehabilitation center to continue his recovery after a deadly traffic accident, his publicist said Friday. ""Tracy has been transferred to an undisclosed rehab center, where he is expected to remain for the next few weeks,"" according to Lewis Kay. ""While he is continuing to show signs of improvement, he still has a long way to go,"" Kay said in a statement. Morgan was critically injured in a limo bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike in the early morning hours of June 7. The 45-year-old Morgan suffered broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken leg. Morgan friend and fellow comedian James McNair was killed in the crash. The semi-truck that rear-ended Morgan's limo was traveling 20 mph over the speed limit and its driver was almost at his drive time limit. That is the finding in a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board released Thursday. Police said in a criminal complaint driver Kevin Roper had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash. The 35-year-old Roper has pleaded not guilty to charges that include vehicular homicide and assault by auto. Roper is free on a $50,000 bond. In the statement released Friday by his publicist, Morgan also said he and his fiancee Megan Wollover ""wanted to publicly express their deepest gratitude to everyone at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital for the unbelievable care and attention they provided him.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With ""birthers"" mostly silent, ""deathers"" are now pushing a new conspiracy theory. The release of President Obama's birth certificate last week apparently tamped down -- to a large degree -- skeptics who questioned whether he could legally serve as president because they said he wasn't a natural-born citizen. Now, a surprisingly diverse crop of people are questioning whether Osama bin Laden is actually dead. Some media outlets and bloggers are calling them ""deathers."" Their claims follow a wide range: Some believe that the world's most-wanted terrorist was not the man killed Sunday, others think bin Laden is dead but was killed many years ago, and still others believe that the September 11 mastermind is alive -- and secretly being interrogated. One Fox Business Network host is not going quite that far. Judge Andrew Napolitano at one point declared that ""Osama bin Laden is dead,"" but he later seemed unconvinced. Napolitano also questioned the president's authority to kill him. Napolitano began his Monday show by saying bin Laden was ""killed on the illegal whim of the president."" Moments later, he added, ""Osama bin Laden is dead. And the president seems to think he has the right to kill whomever he wants so long as the person is perceived as a monster and the public supports it."" And yet the judge also questioned whether officials are ""telling us the truth or pulling a fast one to save Obama's lousy presidency."" Later in the broadcast, Napolitano asked a guest, ""Do you believe he's dead, or do you want some more evidence: a photograph, a testimony of an eyewitness? Something other than the words of a president whose words we have doubted before?"" Others who are questioning bin Laden's death include a libertarian talk radio host, a well-known liberal anti-war activist and some everyday Pakistani students. What their claims all have in common -- much like claims that the president was born outside the U.S., instead of in Hawaii -- is that they go against the agreed-upon facts. Poll: 3% now think Obama born abroad . Obama's decision not to release the photos of bin Laden's death seems to be stoking ""deather"" fires. Alex Jones is a Texas-based talk radio host who also runs various websites and whose YouTube channel claims more than 24 million views. He is sometimes called a right-wing conspiracy theorist. After the president's announcement of bin Laden's death, Jones told his listeners in one broadcast, ""My friends, this is a complete and total hoax."" ""Where is the body?"" Jones asked in another show. ""My White House sources nine years ago, on record, confirmed that he had been killed and was frozen on ice."" Opinion: A no-win decision on releasing photos . Cindy Sheehan, who is certainly not an ideological ally of Jones', appears to agree with him on bin Laden's death. Sheehan became famous for protesting President George W. Bush's Iraq policy -- even camping out at the White House and the president's Crawford, Texas, ranch -- after her son was killed in the war. Shortly after the president's bin Laden announcement, Sheehan planted seeds of doubt on her Facebook page and blog. ""It's not that I don't believe Obama about Osama because he's Obama, I don't believe him because he is just one in along line of butt-naked emperors,"" Sheehan wrote. ""The only proof of Osama being dead again that we were offered was Obama telling us that there was a DNA match between the man killed by the Navy SEALs and OBL. Even if it is possible to get DNA done so quickly, and the regime did have bin Laden DNA lying around a lab somewhere -- where is the empirical proof?"" Sheehan continued. Meanwhile, a Facebook page -- named ""Osama Bin Laden Not Dead"" -- has been created as a sort of message board for theories. ""This whole story is a distraction from Obama's birth certificate bollox,"" Kevin Lane posted. ""That was all over the news until in the space of 24 hours he had found OBL, killed (but not captured) him, done DNA tests and got the results (dont that take 3 days) and dumped his body at sea. Surely if OBL was/is such a bad man they would want the world to see him dead whether the pics are gruesome or not."" ""Bin Laden was taken alive and is being interrogated some where before being executed,"" David Colin Leach posted. Shortly after the announcement of bin Laden's death, university students in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he was killed, expressed skepticism. ""That's propaganda,"" one student told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. ""Osama has been killed 10 years ago in Afghanistan. And it's just a propaganda to finish the war in Afghanistan."" Others refused to believe that bin Laden was even in Abbottabad. And others echoed calls for the Obama administration to show pictures. ""If it is true, then why are they not showing his body?"" one student asked. Would image silence doubters or fan flames? One expert on conspiracy theories said that such wide, diverse claims have one common element: They often come from the political ""fright wing."" ""Your conspiracy theories tend to proliferate on the extreme edges of the political spectrum,"" said John Avlon, a CNN contributor and author of ""Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe is Hijacking America."" ""Unfortunately, you're going to have people who -- especially in today's politics and especially with the amplification that the Internet provides -- will embrace conspiracy theories on almost anything."" And Avlon said such people often share a common trait. ""They come up with these ornate explanations, alternate explanations, for how events occur, like JFK's assassination, in order to keep their own psychology in place. 'Nineteen guys could not have brought down the twin towers. It had to be a government conspiracy,' they say to themselves. Otherwise, the world becomes really scary and unpredictable and unstable for them."" ""While it's entirely predictable that certain Osama bin Laden conspiracy theories would proliferate in the Middle East, because of some people who have a creative interest in those rumors ... the fact that such (bin Laden) conspiracy theories are anywhere in the American political spectrum is a little surprising and a lot pathetic,"" Avlon added.","Skeptics question whether Osama bin Laden is actually dead .

"(CNN) -- Paul J. Zak is the founding Director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies and Professor of Economics, Psychology and Management at Claremont Graduate University. He is the author of The Moral Molecule: The Source of Love and Prosperity. Evolution does not promote happiness. Most creatures live on the edge of survival and do whatever it takes to get through another day. Yet, many human beings seek to be, and often are, happy. How did that happen? I spent a decade running neuroscience experiments to understand why humans are, much of the time, moral. We expect others to be honest, trustworthy, and kind and are outraged when they are not. As I report in my recent book The Moral Molecule: The Source of Love and Prosperity, my experiments showed that a then largely-ignored brain chemical in humans, oxytocin, motivates moral behaviors. Oxytocin does this by producing the feeling of empathy: When we are emotionally connected to others we tend to treat them well. My studies showed this was true even between complete strangers. Over 2,000 years ago, Aristotle claimed that morality comes from being in community with others. My experiments confirm this. Aristotle also argued that practicing virtue made one happy. I decided to put this to the test. I found that individuals who release the most oxytocin -- I call them ""oxytocin-adepts"" -- were more satisfied with their lives compared to those who release less oxytocin. Why? They had better relationships of all types: Romantic, friendships, family, and they even shared more money with strangers in laboratory experiments. The moral molecule morphed in the happy molecule. Happiness largely comes from other people for social creatures like us. The logic step was to see if I could hack the happiness molecule. There is evidence in animals that repeated release of oxytocin biases the brain to release it more easily. In other words, it might be possible to become and oxytocin-adept. I began by refusing to shake hands. My experiments had shown that touch causes the release of oxytocin, so I replaced the handshake with a hug. Yes, for everyone, even on a first meeting. I found that after an embrace people opened up and connected to me much better than before I started this practice. My second hack was spending an extra second looking at people's faces and then telling them what I saw. ""Hi Laura, you look sad today, are you OK?"" Or, ""Hi Jorge, you really look happy, tell me what you've been doing?"" People appreciated my focus on how they felt and conversations went from the superficial to what really mattered. I was practicing empathy. My third hack was the most difficult. Oxytocin is sometimes called the ""love chemical"" because it sustains bonds between romantic partners and between parents and children. I decided to tell my friends and colleagues that I loved them. The response was overwhelming. Everyone lit up, some cried, everyone returned the love in words and deeds. I even earned the nickname ""Dr. Love."" Did I really hack the happiness molecule? I certainly feel much more connected to those around me, more open to emotional experiences, and, well, happier. I recently turned 50 and I was amazed when I had four surprise birthday parties on the same day. I think my brain hacks have made me a better friend, father, and colleague. Rich social networks extend life and improve health, so you might want to try to hack your oxytocin, too. Here's your to-do list: Give eight hugs a day, focus on how those around you feel, and yes, use the ""L"" word when you can. If you find these difficult, start using them on a dog. My experiments have shown dogs are better oxytocin stimulators than other pets, and better stress-reducers, too. One more suggestion: Last year I decided to end every conversation with the word ""service,"" as in, ""I am at your service."" If I'm in a meeting, the person I'm with wants something from me. My new hack is to give others what they want generously whenever possible. Nearly everyone is surprised and pleased by this and I typically get back much more than I have offered. I'm an introvert who learned to revel in community. If you can hack the happiness molecule like I have, then I've been of service. And that makes me happy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul J. Zak.","Paul J. Zak: I spent a decade trying understand why humans are usually moral .

"New York (CNN) -- The Statue of Liberty reopened Sunday morning thanks to state funding after it had been closed for 12 days as a result of the partial government shutdown. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature resorted to ""unusual state action"" and agreed to pay the operational costs of the Statue of Liberty until the federal government reopens, citing economic interests in a news conference Sunday. New York state will pay $61,600 a day over the next several days from its tourism budget. ""Just on the economics of the matter, it makes obvious sense for us to pay for the costs of operation, which pales in comparison to the amount of money we are now losing,"" Cuomo said. According to a statement from Cuomo, a 2012 annual report from the National Park Service counted 3.7 million visitors to Liberty Island in 2011, generating nearly $200 million in economic activity and supporting more than 2,000 jobs. No deal in sight as shutdown approaches third week . Bill Rudin, chairman of the Battery Conservancy, which operates the 25-acre park and ticketing center for ferries to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, said that 400 jobs have been lost at the Statue of Liberty and surrounding parks since the government shutdown began on October 1. Rudin estimated that the 10,000 daily visitors each spend $35, adding up to losses in the thousands of dollars during the closure. Bradford A. Hill, president of Evelyn Hill Inc., a family company that runs the gift shops and restaurants at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, said that the firm's sales dropped nearly 70% this year between damage from Superstorm Sandy and the government shutdown. Evelyn Hill Inc. had to lay off 110 employees, until the state stepped in to help. ""It is heartening to know that when Washington, D.C., fails to deliver to Americans, and there is no end to the gridlock in sight, we have a state that we can rely on to step up to the plate and take over critical responsibilities,"" Hill said. ""Today, with the leadership of Governor Cuomo, we opened our doors again today and welcomed back our employees."" Cuomo said the state stepped in not just for economic reasons, but also for symbolic reasons. ""The Statue of Liberty is more than just a tourism destination, more than just a creator of economy, a creator of jobs; it is probably the most profound symbol for freedom and democracy, certainly in this country, but possibly around the world,"" he said. Tourists were happy to hear the announcement of the reopening and began lining up to visit the New York City landmark. ""We would have been disappointed. We probably would have taken the Staten Island ferry or a Circle Line Cruise to at least go near the island to get a picture, but I've done that before, and it's just so much better to be on the island. It's a really neat experience,"" said Stacy Kratt, who was visiting New York City. Like New York, Arizona and South Dakota struck similar deals to reopen the Grand Canyon and Mount Rushmore, respectively. All national monuments and parks were closed when Congress failed to approve spending for the fiscal year. More than 20,000 National Park Service employees who maintain and secure the facilities were furloughed. The nation's 401 National Park Service sites collectively average about 715,000 visitors per day. Utah reopens its national parks . Eatocracy: Food safety hampered by shutdown . CNN's Bryan Koenig and Leslie Bentz contributed to this report.","The Statue of Liberty reopens after New York state agrees to pay to run it .

"(The Frisky) -- Let's face it -- we've all got issues and sometimes need multiple attempts to surmount emotional obstacles. But some of us are better at dealing with them than others and, we argue, women are often better at working through emotional problems than men. The Frisky: 30 things every woman should quit doing by 30 . In the last few years of dating, we've come across 10 types of ""emotionally stunted"" guys -- adult men who may otherwise be awesome but for some reason never matured emotionally. These dudes are stuck in emotional ""playpens"" preventing them from forming healthy (and intimate) adult relationships and where the women in their lives are in the position of either pushing them around like toddlers in a baby carriage or screaming ""Get up and walk on your own!"" before heading out the door. Usually, emotional immaturity isn't obvious right away. In the first few weeks and months of dating, as our best selves are presented, we've found ourselves thinking, Finally, a guy who isn't emotionally stunted! He's a MAN -- not a man-CHILD! But at some point, the curtain is pulled back just like in the ""Wizard of Oz"" and, yup, his emotional issues are right there. The Frisky: 12 stars posing using hands as bras . Don't get us wrong: Women can be emotionally stunted too. But we have found that the emotionally stunted man-child will have one of two (immature) responses when the issue is brought to his attention: . 1. ""Nuh uh! I'm not emotionally stunted! You're the one with the problem, meanie!"" 2. ""This is who I am and I like being this way. Take it or leave it!"" To which we reply, ""Smell ya later."" And so should you. Here is our roundup of the top 10 types of emotionally stunted men (often seen in combination), the kind of women they're after, and what they need more than you coddling them a second longer. 1. The Addict: Oy. Where to begin. Here's the important thing to remember: The Addict will ALWAYS be looking for a high. ALWAYS. Even if he is sober from drugs/alcohol/gambling/food, if he hasn't done ""the work,"" he may get hooked on you. The Frisky: 25 signs he is not relationship material . The woman he wants: Someone who gets him high. He's looking for a feeling. Maybe it's the married woman, his crush from high school he never thought he would get, or the ex he dumped years ago. It's all about the thrill for him. And once that thrill wears off ... he's jonesing for the next. What he really needs: To work through his co-dependency issues and learn how to cope with life on his own before involving anyone else. 2. The Mama's Boy: The most important relationship a guy can have is with his mother. That's why it's bad news if that relationship has gone wrong in some way. The Mama's Boy compares all women to his mother. Whether he hates her or is obsessed with her, he is blind to the fact that he is replaying his relationship with his mom with every woman he gets involved with. The Frisky: A dress made for Coco's assets . The woman he wants: Someone who is exactly like his mother or exactly the opposite, depending on the nature of the dysfunction. If his mom was coddling and overprotective, he may want you to change his diaper and wipe his nose. If his mother abandoned him, he may be looking for a clingy lady. If his mother expected him to be ""the man of the family,"" he may be looking for a woman who is helpless and needs taking care of. You get the picture. What he really needs: To realize that you are NOT his mother. And, more importantly, to understand the relationship dynamic with his mother. If he has issues to work out with her, he needs to do it before he invites another woman into his life. The Frisky: 7 things guys say that spell trouble . 3. The Flounderer: He's unhappy in his career, either because he hasn't advanced as much as he thought he would have or it's not what he wants to be doing, period. The woman he wants: Someone to motivate him and stroke his ego all the time because he's not getting that kind of love in the workplace. What he really needs: To go after what he wants hard and on his own initiative instead of whining to you about it all the time . The Frisky: Joe Francis and 9 celeb players who settled down . 4. The Insecure Narcissist: Initially, this gentleman comes off as exceedingly confident -- he thinks he's the best at his job, takes good care of his appearance, and is often the life of the party. But he also cannot take a joke at his expense, overstates how successful he is, and is never happy for anyone who's doing ""better"" than him -- including the woman he's with. The woman he wants: Someone who won't ever challenge him or give him grief, even as a joke. If she does, he'll find her insecurities and go at them with a hacksaw, so she's brought down to his level, making him feel better about himself in comparison. What he really needs: To stop pretending like he's God's gift to the world and be OK being vulnerable, and realize that he's not fooling anyone with that act anyway. The Frisky: 8 celebs swindled by their own families . 5. The Career Obsessive: Here's the thing about dudes: They are not all that great at multi-tasking, but The Career Obsessive is the worst of the lot. His sole goal in life is to rise to the top and it's not until he gets there that he'll actually be emotionally available. The woman he wants: Someone who understands that being successful is the most important thing in the world -- so long as SHE is not more successful than him -- and will reward his hard work in the office with sexual favors at home whenever he's got a spare moment. The opposite of The Hero [see No. 6 below], he wants someone who does not need him emotionally at all. What he really needs: To realize that a fulfilling life is all about balance and an amazing career doesn't keep you warm at night. The Frisky: 10 famous female cheaters . 6. The Hero: He loves to date a basket case, a woman who's got many issues for him to help her overcome -- but that's only so he can avoid dealing with his own. Once she's more stable, the skeletons in his emotional closet emerge and he has to find someone new to save instead. The woman he wants: A woman who ""needs"" him and makes him feel strong, capable, manly, and, most of all, NOT CRAZY in comparison. What he really needs: To find a therapist who can hold up a mirror and show him that his own problems should take top priority. 7. The Tragic Tom: Tragedy has befallen him and he hasn't been able to recover. While being sympathetic to this guy's plight is understandable, trying to save him is a waste of time. The woman he wants: A woman who will see his gooey marshmallow center underneath that hardened edge and will exhaust herself trying to save him from himself. What he really needs: To gain perspective and to learn, on his own, that bad things happen to everyone in some form and the best you can do is move forward in your life with lessons learned. The Frisky: Why these celebrities decide to cheat . 8. The Commitment Phobe: This guy pretends to be happy on his own, living large as a bachelor, just like his hero George Clooney, but he's actually just terrified of letting a woman get to know the real him. The woman he wants: Someone who will never expect their relationship to evolve past the casually dating stage, who will never expect to meet his parents or even necessarily his friends, and won't want to talk about pesky things like feeeeelings. What he really needs: To face his insecurities head on, so he can figure out what he's so scared of showing to other people and to get over it. The Frisky: 12 celebs who've denied getting breast implants . 9. The Eternally Brokenhearted: He hasn't gotten over the chick who broke his heart and he holds what she did against every other woman he dates in subtle ways. The woman he wants: Someone who reinforces his anger at his ex by committing the same ""sins"" she did. That way he can punish her for his ex's actions. Unfortunately for both of them, he'll never be able to work through his anger completely with that kind of black-and-white attitude in which he's the sole victim. What he really needs: To find closure with the woman who ""wronged him,"" but not necessarily through confrontation. Rather, he needs to look at the demise of the relationship objectively so he's forced to acknowledge his role and can move forward in a new relationship with no (or minimal) baggage. The Frisky: 8 celebs who were Hooters girls . 10. The Eeyore: Thanks for noticing him, the dull, pathetic, dude in the corner who is not actually dull and pathetic. He just has the worst attitude of all time. He's always whining about something. Every day is a bad day. Nothing ever works out for him. Everything seems completely impossible to The Eeyore, which makes being around him unbearable. The woman he wants: His own personal Pooh Bear. That special someone who will be his personal cheerleader and spend all of her time trying to get him to look on the bright side even though he is completely incapable of seeing life that way. What he really needs: To stop feeling sorry for himself and take responsibility for what happens in his life. The sooner he realizes that life is what you make it, the sooner he'll have some much-needed company in his bed.

"(Rolling Stone) -- After years of near-silence, Eddie Murphy gives a rare extensive print interview in the new issue of Rolling Stone, on stands and available through Rolling Stone All Access on October 28th. In the Q&A, Murphy opens up to senior writer Brian Hiatt about the ups and downs of his long career, his possible return to stand-up, his Oscar hosting plans and much more. Murphy, who co-stars in the upcoming ""Tower Heist,"" is baffled by his reputation as a near-recluse: ""I leave my house all the time,"" he says. ""But I'm not at all the Hollywood parties. I'm grown, and where else am I supposed to be? I'm supposed to be home . . . If I were out in the clubs every night, they'd be saying, 'That's a shame, look at him, 50 years old, he's still out at these clubs.' Recluses are nasty, with long nails, don't wash their a**. . . . I'm too vain to be a recluse. But homebody, absolutely. I'm 50 years old, beautiful house, I'm supposed to be home, chilling."" Murphy says that his days of making family movies may be over. ""I don't have any interest in that right now,"" he says. ""There's really no blueprint, but I'm trying to do some edgy stuff. And I only want to do what I really want to do, otherwise I'm content to sit here and play my guitar all day. I always tell people now that I'm a semiretired gentleman of leisure, and occasionally I'll go do some work to break the boredom up."" Murphy has decided not to make ""Beverly Hills Cop IV."" ""They're not doing it,"" he says. ""What I'm trying to do now is produce a TV show starring Axel Foley's son, and Axel is the chief of police now in Detroit. I'd do the pilot, show up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong."" Unlike other ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni, Murphy has refused to participate in retrospectives and hasn't been on the show in years -- but he's gotten over his grudge. ""They were s***** to me on 'Saturday Night Live' a couple of times after I'd left the show,"" he says. ""They said some s***** things. There was that David Spade sketch [when Spade showed a picture of Murphy around the time of ""Vampire In Brooklyn"" and said, 'Look, children, a falling star']. I made a stink about it, it became part of the folklore. What really irritated me about it at the time was that it was a career shot.. I felt s***** about it for years, but now, I don't have none of that."" Murphy hasn't performed stand-up since the late 1980s, but recently, he's given some thought to trying again. ""If I ever get back onstage, I'm going to have a really great show for you all,"" he says. ""An hour and a half of stand-up and about 40 minutes of my s***** band . . . But I haven't done it since I was 27, so why f*** with it? But that's just weighing both sides. It comes up too much for me to not do it again. It's like, when it hits me, I'll do it, eventually."" Murphy addresses reports that he stormed out of the Oscars after losing the best supporting actor award to Alan Arkin. ""Alan Arkin's performance in 'Little Miss Sunshine' is Oscar-worthy, it's a great performance. That's just the way the s*** went. He's been gigging for years and years, the guy's in his seventies. I totally understood and was totally cool. I wasn't like, 'What the f***?' Afterward, people were like, 'He's upset,' and I'm like, 'I wasn't upset!' What happened was after I lost, I'm just chilling, and I was sitting next to BeyoncÃ©'s pops, and he leans over and grabs me and is like, [solemn voice] 'There will be other times.' And then you feel Spielberg on your shoulder going, 'It's all right, man.' Then Clint Eastwood walks by: 'Hey, guy . . . ' So I was like, 'It's not going to be this night!' [Mimes getting up] I didn't have sour grapes at all. That's another reason I wanted to host the show -- to show them that I'm down with it."" See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- Former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney -- a longtime journalist before he joined the Obama administration in its infancy -- is back in the media game as a political analyst for CNN. We caught up with Carney on Wednesday, in the hours before President Obama addresses the nation to outline his plan for dismantling ISIS, the brutal terrorist group that's roiling Iraq and Syria. A former White House insider, Carney had insight into how the President and his team are preparing for such a major address. But he also riffed on the state of the news media, the ""not ideal"" state of the White House press briefing, Hillary Clinton's potential campaign and how Twitter has accelerated the political news cycle. CNN: So pull back the curtain a little bit, if you can, before tonight's speech. What is happening today? Who is in the room with the president, and what is he doing in there? Carney: When speeches are important like this one, the president is the primary writer of the speech. He will get a draft, a very good one, from his team. From Ben Rhodes and Cody Keenan. But he will spend a good amount of time making sure it's really what he wants to say. I am sure as we get closer to speech time he will be fine-tuning it, working with his team. And he is keenly aware of the unique opportunity to give a speech to the nation. They don't come that often. There aren't that many occasions, outside of a State of the Union address, where a president in this media age has an audience as big as he'll have tonight. Analysis: Obama speech a do-over on 'no strategy' CNN: From a communications strategy perspective, when do you guys make the calculation that an issue deserves a national address in primetime? Carney: The truth is we would do it more, but the networks, especially the broadcast networks, are not always willing to say yes. The threshold question is, you know, is it of national significance on a major issue -- something that the president feels the American people need to hear about? Matters of military force are the most obvious circumstances that merit a primetime address. There are also issues around significant domestic legislation, or national issues. He did a national speech launching health care reform that was primetime. It's not a well you can go back to that often, though, because it requires the networks to give the time. I remember when I was there, we asked for time once and the networks shot us down, which was very frustrating. (The White House requested primetime real estate in April to tout health care enrollment numbers.) We did a little research, and there was a pretty good case to be made that the reluctance to give time has increased over the years. The ask we made might have been granted in past presidencies. But that's just the nature of the business. I don't think it's going to change. Obama is open to airstrikes on ISIS in Syria, wants to arm rebels . CNN: How frustrated is the president that Middle Eastern conflict is consuming his agenda right now, after taking a victory lap by ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and after the big 2009 Cairo speech that was aimed at repairing America's image in the world? Carney: I don't think he gets surprised or disappointed by the revelation that the world doesn't bend to your will and your agenda all that willingly. It's been the fundamental responsibility of being president, and a huge part of the job, to deal with these kind of crises overseas and potential threats to the United States. I don't think he is disappointed. I think he is realistic about the fact that there is still a lot of work he wants to get done. And he knows that the time he has left will go by pretty quickly. My guess is that he realizes that the absolute necessity of dealing with the Islamic State, and with the situation in Ukraine, reduces the amount of time and focus he can put on other topics. But it's not really a choice for him. You don't have the choice you just have to do it. As Obama prepares for ISIS fight, where are the doves? CNN: The president caught a ton of flak for golfing after making a statement on the beheading of James Foley. He said on 'Meet The Press' this weekend that the optics of politics don't come natural to him. The guy is obviously a talented showman and politician. Does he really not get the theatrics of politics at this point? Carney: Here is what I say about that. He definitely doesn't and never has approached the job in a way that puts a high priority or focus on optics, and I think that's because 10 years and a few months ago if you passed him on the street, you wouldn't have known who he was. That makes him wholly different. What that means is, he is a different kind of person than the kind of person who normally takes this office. Sometimes that creates problems, but I also thinks it's why he is president, and why he was re-elected. You can't be both somebody who emerged from outside Washington and catapulted onto the scene with a powerful message and also be a known entity to national political reporters and the general American public as somebody who was aspiring to the presidency for years. You can't be both. He is not a typical and never was a typical politician. That's an asset and a liability. You can't say, 'I wish he was more like this or that,' because if he were, he wouldn't be the guy who persuaded more than 50% of the country to vote for him two times in a row. That's a long way of saying he is never going to be the kind of president who is routinely focused on the optics and theatrics of the office. Sometimes that's going to cause him problems and frustrate his aides. When that happens, you also have to remember it's part of who he is. Obama: Golfing after Foley statement was a bad idea . CNN: Does he ever consult with former President Bill Clinton before big moments like this? Do they have that kind of relationship these days? Carney: I don't know how often they talk. I don't think it would necessarily be before a speech like this, but I could be wrong. He is certainly close to former Secretary (Hillary) Clinton and to President Clinton. He saw him not that long ago, in August. But there isn't a regular conversation that I was aware of. But it's not an infrequent one either. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush yuk it up . CNN: We're starting to see blind quotes from Hillary Clinton ""aides"" expressing criticism of Obama's handling of Syria and Iraq. If she runs for president, how does Hillary balance the thornier parts of Obama's record with her time in the administration? Carney: Obviously that's something that she will figure out if she decides to run. She was Secretary of State for President Obama for four years and she understands that record will be part of what she runs on. Her time as Secretary of State is something she should be proud of, and the President's record on foreign policy is something she is more likely to embrace than anything because she was a big part of it. 'Hugging it out': Hillary Clinton calls Obama to calm tensions . CNN: So what exactly is the point of White House briefings? Carney: It's become kind of theatrical and probably less helpful than either the White House or White House press corps wishes it would be. It's kind of ironic because now I am a contributor on a TV channel, but the reason that is, by and large, is because of TV. Mike McCurry, my predecessor, one of Bill Clinton's press secretaries, has apologized to every one of his successors for being the press secretary who agreed to televise the entirety of press briefings. Prior to that they were only televised for the first 10 minutes and then the cameras were turned off. It was inevitable anyway. But if you look at transcripts of a regular daily briefing in which the cameras are on, and compare it substantively and tonally to an off-camera briefing on Air Force One â€” the gaggles that I would do and press secretaries would do with traveling press on the plane. The White House ones â€” it's a lot of different. The ones not on camera tend to be more sober, more based in information and less gotcha-oriented. The format is not ideal anymore. The problem is if Josh (Earnest) or any successor of his were to suddenly announce we weren't doing it anymore there would be an uproar by the press, and by the TV press. If they were to say no more on-camera briefings, that would not be accepted. White House press secretary Jay Carney leaving . CNN: Does Twitter make your job easier or more difficult? Carney: Oh man. Much more difficult. Not in a bad way. It put what was already an extremely fast news cycle into warp-speed. Obviously this White House is the only one that has existed in the era of Twitter. These tools can be very useful for getting information out. The White House has become much more Twitter-focused with more people having Twitter handles on staff. The fact that Twitter has become such a driving force in breaking news creates a whole host of challenges. It's sort of like the challenges that CNN first created for White Houses back when they were the only 24-hour television news network. It just changed the pace dramatically. So Twitter and social media have done that again. CNN: Last one: What was the dumbest news cycle during your time in the White House? Carney: Wow. There are so many to choose from. The first one that came to mind was the birth certificate saga. There is one every week or every month competing with serious stuff. Look, everybody finds themselves chasing the ball down the field sometimes and they wish they hadn't. I think it's both reporters and White House. But everybody ends up being better served, included readers and viewers of the media, if everybody reverts back to stuff that actually matters.","Former White House spokesman Jay Carney joins CNN as a political analyst .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former manager Sam Lutfi claims Britney Spears' parents defamed, libeled and cheated him out of millions in a battle for control of the pop star and her career. A book written by Spears' mother painted Lutfi as a ""predator"" and a ""Svengali"" who kept Spears drugged and isolated her from her family so he could control her, his defamation lawsuit against the Spears family alleges. Lutfi is suing for millions in defamation damages and for money he said he's owed for being Spears' personal manager, a job he said he lost when a court appointed her father as her conservator four years ago. Contrary to implications that he gave Spears drugs, Lutfi testified that he insisted as a condition of his employment with her that she stay clean and sober. They shook hands on the management agreement in June 2007 only after Spears agreed that he could use drug-detection dogs in her home to check her compliance, he testified. Those dogs found ""a baggie of white powder"" in her home on June 13, 2007, he testified. ""We flushed it down the toilet."" Lutfi testified that he urged Britney to reconcile with her parents, including arranging a reunion between the singer and her mother in October. ""That is the opposite of a Svengali,"" Lutfi lawyer Joseph Schlimmer said. Lutfi befriended Spears in spring 2007, when she ""was very distraught over numerous situations, child custody battle, divorce, career problems and drug problems,"" Lutfi testified. Their friendship began at a time when Spears was estranged from her parents, he said. She soon asked Lutfi to become her manager, he said. His four-year contract, which would pay him 15% of her gross earnings, was not written but was confirmed by text messages, his lawsuit claimed. His work with Spears ended after a few months, in February 2008, after she was taken to a Los Angeles hospital for psychiatric treatment. The book, published in 2008, has subjected him to ""hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy,"" causing him to suffer a ""loss of his reputation, shame, mortification and hurt feelings,"" the suit claims. On the witness stand Tuesday, Lutfi told jurors he met Spears in a Los Angeles nightclub when she asked if she could have his hat. He refused because he needed it to hide his bald head, he said. Spears told him it was refreshing to hear ""no,"" he said. She got his phone number and soon began calling him, he said. His first actions after he became her manager included controlling the paparazzi who chased her 24 hours a day, he said. ""She was dealing with a lot of anxiety with the way they would follow her,"" Lutfi said. She was in ""crisis mode"" dealing with 20 to 50 photographers following her every move, he said. Lutfi said he set up an arrangement with the photographers in which he would send them text messages to let them know where she was going as long as they followed his rules. He invited some of the paparrazzi into her home to meet Spears so they ""could see her as a human being,"" he said. They also agreed to give her 3 to 6 feet of space so she could walk freely and to stop yelling slurs to provoke her to get a photo to sell, he said. They even began saving her a parking space at her destinations, he said. Lutfi's testimony was expected to continue Wednesday. Earlier Tuesday, the judge ruled that Lutfi's lawyer could not use Spears' medical records in the trial. He argued it was necessary to prove that Lutfi was not secretly drugging Spears to control her. Spears will not testify in the trial, which began last week. The judge overseeing her conservatorship prohibited her appearance on the witness stand. Lutfi said he is the co-manager of Courtney Love, the widow of musician Kurt Cobain, and a consultant for his mother's chain of gas stations.","Sam Lutfi was ousted from Spears' life when her dad became her conservator .

"(CNN) -- If you're Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, you'll get one more hour to scour for votes ahead of Tuesday's presidential election. If you're spending a night out on the town, that could translate to 60 more minutes dazzling the dance floor. And if you're tired, or perhaps lucky, that means one more hour of sleep. Daylight Saving Time may bring health problems . All options are on the table this weekend, when U.S. residents turn back the clock as part of the semi-annual daylight saving routine. At 2 a.m. Sunday, people will ""fall back"" one hour -- in essence, allowing them to relive the 1 a.m. hour two times over. The change affects all those in the United States except for people in Hawaii and parts of Arizona who do not observe daylight saving time. The territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa also do not recognize the change. For those who do change the digits on their clocks, the sun will seem to come up earlier in the morning and it will set earlier at night, relative to conditions just a few days earlier. The idea for daylight saving came from legendary American inventor, statesman and founding father Ben Franklin who, in a 1784 letter to a French journal, suggested that Parisians could save thousands of francs annually by waking up earlier in the summer so they wouldn't have to buy so many candles to light the evening hours. TIME: 8 ways to beat the winter blues . The United States didn't adopt the practice until the 20th century -- for a brief time during World War I, again during World War II and on a state-by-state basis in the years after the war. It became a national policy, with some tinkering, beginning in 1966. Dozens of other countries now observe some form of daylight saving as well. The extra hour that people will get this weekend will only last so long. Americans will have to give it back by ""springing forward"" -- and turning ahead their clock -- one hour on March 10, 2013.","At 2 a.m. Sunday, most Americans should turn back their clocks one hour .

"(Health.com) -- Roughly 20% of the antibiotic prescriptions written in the United States for adults each year are for sinus infections. That's an impressive statistic, given that doctors and public health officials have long doubted that antibiotics can successfully treat the condition. A new study, published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, appears to confirm those doubts: The antibiotic amoxicillin was no better than placebo at improving the congestion, cough, runny nose, pain, and other symptoms that accompany sinus infections (also known as acute sinusitis), researchers found. ""Compared to placebo, amoxicillin doesn't seem to provide any benefits,"" says lead author Jane Garbutt, an associate professor at the Washington University School of Medicine, in St. Louis. ""In terms of patient satisfaction, side effects, symptom relief, days missed from work, et cetera, we did not see any difference."" Health.com: Is it a cold? Or a sinus infection? Most sinus infections are caused by viruses, which don't respond to antibiotics. But even bacterial sinus infections rarely require antibiotic treatment, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In most cases, both types of infection go away on their own in less than two weeks. ""Most patients get better despite antibiotics, not because of them,"" says Garbutt. ""There is a high rate of spontaneous resolution."" Antibiotics would be more useful if doctors were able to distinguish between viral and bacterial sinusitis. But general practitioners have no tests at their disposal that reliably diagnose bacterial infections, Garbutt says, and in the study she and her colleagues were unable to identify any symptoms or other markers that predicted which patients would respond to antibiotics. ""The problem for primary care physicians is figuring out which patients would benefit,"" she says. Health.com: How to tell if you need an antibiotic . The study included 166 people with moderate or severe sinus infections. Half of the participants took amoxicillin three times a day for 10 days, and the other half took a placebo on the same schedule. In addition, every patient was given acetaminophen, cough medicine, and decongestants to use as needed. The two groups of patients improved at approximately the same rate. By day three, just over one-third of those in each group reported a lessening of their symptoms, a proprotion that increased to roughly 80% in each group by day 10. The patients taking antibiotics did feel measurably better than the placebo group on day seven, but the researchers did not consider the difference to be clinically (as opposed to statistically) significant. On that day, the difference in the two groups' quality of life -- as measured by a scale appropriately named SNOT-16 -- was negligible, the study notes. Health.com: 10 products that can ease sinus symptoms . The results reinforce what many doctors have suspected, even if they've continued to prescribe antibiotics to sinusitis patients, says Daniel Merenstein, M.D., an assistant professor of family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center, in Washington, D.C. ""We don't practice it, but we do know it,"" he says. ""This study might help us give out fewer antibiotics."" The main reason doctors continue to prescribe antibiotics is that patients have come to expect them, Garbutt and her colleagues note. One way of satisfying patients without overusing antibiotics, Garbutt says, is to give them a prescription but advise them not to fill it unless their symptoms persist or worsen -- a protocol that's become popular in Europe. Garbutt says it's also vital that doctors talk to their patients about which treatments work, which don't, and why. ""You have to have some communication plan,"" she says. ""You need to provide information about what they should expect and what to do if their condition deteriorates."" Health.com: Surprising causes of sinus trouble . Patient expectations aren't the only driver of antibiotic use for sinus infections, however. Mark Shikowitz, M.D., director of the Zucker Nasal and Sinus Center at North Shore--Long Island Jewish Health System, in New Hyde Park, New York, says some doctors prescribe the drugs to guard against the very rare chance that a sinus infection will progress to something much worse, such as a brain abscess, a bundle of cells that can develop following a bacterial infection. ""The chances are quite small, but the outcome if it does happen can be catastrophic,"" Shikowitz says. ""And behind every bad outcome is a medical malpractice attorney."" Some doctors will be reluctant to withhold or discourage antibiotics until physician organizations formally adopt the conservative approach advocated by Garbutt and her colleagues as the new standard of care, he says. The overuse of antibiotics for sinusitis has important public-health implications in light of the growing concerns about antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses. Widespread antibiotic use can lead the infectious organisms that cause disease to adapt a defense, making the drug less effective in the population overall.

"(CNN) -- As she sat in the makeup chair, dressed in a plush terrycloth robe while two women did her nails and another did her makeup, Tziporah Salamon knew the day she had longed for had finally arrived. The 62-year-old New Yorker has a long resume of disparate jobs: schoolteacher, performer, hostess and shop girl, to name a few. But in April, she finally added model for a high-fashion house to the list. ""I felt like such a princess, a queen for a day,"" Salamon said. ""I was as high as a kite."" For many, the life of a model is the stuff of dreams, an aspiration so far out of reach that we would never dare utter it to friends. But some fashion labels are putting the focus on women (and men) who aren't typical calendar girls. Salamon is one of 11 ""real people"" selected to appear in French designer Lanvin's winter ad campaign, which is generating buzz for using people of all sizes, colors and ages to create intimate images that resemble portraits. It's about bringing a sense of reality to fashion to show that the lofty world of high style is not as unattainable as it seems, said Alber Elbaz, creative director of Lanvin. ""Fashion doesn't look good only on models, it can look good on different people of different ages and different body shapes,"" he said. ""We didn't think there would be such a big talk because we just did it and we thought let's try to work with real people. Let's do street casting, let's work with different men and women of different ages and see what comes out of it."" Aging Stylishly, online and in the streets . None of them fit the typical model mold because they aren't professional models. Casting agent Zan Ludlum found Salamon and 82-year-old Jacquie ""Tajah"" Murdock through the popular street style blog Advanced Style, which documents men and women of a certain age. Others came from street scouting, including one of the older male models, who was spotted walking out of a basement bar in New York's East Village, said Ludlum, whose agency scouted the models. While the Lanvin models are not professionals, they possess a certain mystique. ""It's beyond visual. Sure, they might have great eyes or features but it's more about their presence, their ownership of their own individuality,"" Ludlum said. ""You might see someone who has style, but if you strip away everything, are they still powerful? Because we are taking them out of who they are and putting them in new clothes. Are they interesting beyond what they're wearing?"" Of course, pounding the pavement in search of raw talent is nothing new. But it's becoming increasingly common as fashion and style slowly embrace different ideals of beauty. Earlier this month, American Apparel revealed that the new face of its ad campaign would be 60-year-old Jacky O'Shaughnessy, who was spotted in a New York restaurant. In swimwear, Spanish designer Dolores CortÃ©s chose an infant with Down syndrome to be the face of the brand's 2013 DC Kids ads. It would have been easy to create a beautiful photo with a beautiful model, said Elbaz, especially working with photographer Steven Meisel and some of the top names in hair and makeup. But, at this level, it's important to think outside the box and move forward with each campaign, he said. ""I'm always looking for a story,"" said Elbaz, whose career includes stints with Geoffrey Beene, Guy Laroche and Yves Saint Laurent. ""In high fashion we're always accused of doing things that are not very relevant, not the real world. I know that it's important sometimes to do fantasy but I felt like touching people and going back to different women and men, especially the idea of different ages and body shapes."" It's a timely message, he said, in an era of cultural bias toward youth-oriented ideals of beauty. ""The phenomenon I see today of women erasing their age -- nobody is allowed to have an age anymore, nobody is allowed to have wrinkles or imperfections,"" he said. ""I thought, let's change that, let's show that fashion can be amazing on 81-year-olds and 17-year-olds, on Tziporah, who is not [European] size 36, and she looks gorgeous."" While apparel and lifestyle brands have long been using ""real people"" to draw new audiences and generate buzz, it's rare for a high-fashion house such as Lanvin to take this approach, said Sarah Collins, associate chair of fashion at the Savannah College of Art and Design. But it's happening more often, in ads and on the covers of fashion magazines, she said, as part of the effort to democratize fashion. Has image overtaken music? ""The effect on viewers is that it's easier for them to pictures themselves in the clothes and identify with the clothing line,"" she said. ""Not only is it about democracy of fashion but it creates a buzz. How do you stand out as a fashion ad campaign? By using people off the street it does generate buzz."" It also reflects the growing influence of street style blogs in touting alternative beauty ideals, said Ari Cohen, the writer behind the Advanced Style blog, which led the casting agency to Salamon and Murdock. ""I think the message is to embrace individuality and personal style, and alternative notions of beauty,"" Cohen said. ""It's hugely important to show more diversity in advertising. By focusing on superyoung models and too much Photoshopping, advertisers set up unreal expectations for consumers."" Even if consumers like what they see in the Lanvin campaign, that doesn't mean they'll be able to afford it. For Salamon, the vintage Lanvin jacket that she owned before the shoot will have to suffice, along with memories of being a queen for a day. ""What are the odds that my first time out as a model I'm with the top people in the field?"" she said. ""It totally came to me, I didn't do anything to make this happen except be myself. It was all orchestrated by God, a gift from the universe."" How do you feel about fashion and reality colliding? Would you like to see more 'realistic' fashion ads? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.","French fashion house Lanvin generates buzz with ad campaign using ""real people""

"(CNN) -- Jeff Probst was a bit of a travel late bloomer, but the ""Survivor"" host has more than made up for lost time. Born and raised in Wichita, Kansas, ""I was never a foreign exchange student and didn't even have a passport until 'Survivor,' "" says Probst, 52. The show has been ""a life-changing experience."" Since the competitive reality series debuted on CBS in 2000, the Emmy-winning host and executive producer hasn't stopped traveling all over the world. ""I've been underwater at 60 feet with a shark and found myself sitting out in an Africa game reserve with zebras running past me,"" says Probst. ""I really began to understand simultaneously how unique I am and how I'm one grain of sand in this giant beach we live on. It really did help shape me."" The 28th ""Survivor"" season finale airs live on Wednesday, May 21. The cast and crew work hard, shooting two seasons of the CBS series over 78 days of the 95 days they're on location. Anytime there's a break, ""we play hard,"" says Probst. And where they get to play is pretty spectacular. Probst shared his top 10 favorite spots in the world with CNN, some of which are places the show took him. Others may surprise you. 1. Palau . Anytime he had a break during shooting ""Survivor"" seasons 10 and 16 on Palau, an island nation in the western Pacific Ocean, Probst headed to the water to scuba dive. ""Of all the places we traveled, if you're into ocean and scuba diving or just snorkeling, it's one of the greatest spots in the world,"" he says. Blue Corner, a popular (and advanced) diving spot where you can descend at least 20 feet and clip onto a rock, is a favorite dive. ""You don't go anywhere,"" he says. ""The entire sea world goes past you, and it's the most amazing aquarium in the world."" Another favorite spot is Jellyfish Lake, the home of hundreds of thousands of jellyfish that have lost the need to sting because they don't have to fight predators. ""You're swimming with these jellyfish, and it's like being on a psychedelic trip,"" he says. 2. Kenya . Stargazing and waking up to wildlife outside his tent at the Shaba National Reserve in Kenya were two of Probst's favorite memories of season three. ""You've never seen stars like you see in Africa,"" he says. ""There's no ambient light ... when you really see what's up there, it's mind-blowing."" He'd head back into his tent to sleep. Come morning, he would open his tent zipper one click at a time. ""You didn't want to scare off the wildlife that you hoped was waiting outside your tent. It was not uncommon to find zebra and giraffes."" ""A lion chased a zebra through our protective fence into camp and killed the zebra, and two other lions came to help with the kill,"" he says. 3. Cook Islands . Looking for a remote desert island? ""Survivor"" location scouts found a perfect spot in the Cook Islands in the South Pacific for season 13. The Polynesian culture of the islands celebrates the sea and offers a relaxed way of life. Known especially for coral reef lagoons, kayaking and beaches, the islands also offered Probst and the crew a chance to know the locals. ""The majority of our crew lived with local families. You could eat (at work) or you could eat with them."" Probst picked up a bit of the relaxed local attitude. ""You can't help but be impacted by a different lifestyle. You do realize there are lots of ways to live."" World's best new skyscraper is ... 4. Kona, Hawaii . Formerly a retreat for Hawaiian royalty, Kona is now the Probst family's vacation spot during spring break. That's because Probst married Lisa Russell, who had two children from a previous marriage, in 2011. They all often head to Kona when the children, Michael, 10, and Ava, 7, are on spring break. ""There's something about Kona,"" he says. ""I feel so at home and grounded and connected to the earth (there). I love the weather and the water. It's so peaceful. Lisa and I have talked about if we ever lived somewhere else, this would be the place."" 5. Amazon, Brazil . Every season in the Amazon, it rains so much that the water levels rise and drop by 40 feet in a matter of weeks, says Probst. The season six crew stayed at the Ariau Amazon Towers, a hotel built on stilts. When they arrived, there was no water around the hotel. During the shoot, it rained so much they ended up surrounded by water, by design. Probst says the Amazon is the spookiest place he has been, and not just because of his childhood fear of crocodiles. ""There are more insects and snakes and weird animals--I didn't know what they wereâ€”than I've ever seen before. And there are piranha in the water."" And those crocodiles? Traveling to the Tribal Council -- the ceremony where players are eliminated -- required traveling down a river in a skinny, motor-equipped canoe. ""We would take these canoes, and I'd shine a flashlight on the shore and see pairs of red (crocodile) eyes dotting it,"" he says. ""I'd be almost petrified the canoe would tip over."" Don't worry about him, though. ""I like being out of my comfort zone,"" he says. ""I don't know that I would ever visit again, but it's on the kids' bucket list."" That means he'll probably be back. 6. Australian outback . ""Survivor"" season two took the cast and crew into the outback, where Probst often woke to a family of kangaroos outside his tent. ""We think of them as friendly, but know they are lethal and massive,"" he says. ""One could literally kill me with one kick to my head while yawning."" Absorbing a bit of Australian culture, Probst also returned home to Los Angeles worrying less about everything. ""Australians have a different way of living: 'No worries' comes from a place of truth. They don't worry nearly as much about things as we do."" ""It's had the greatest impact on my life, how I raise my kids and how the show works,"" he says. ""Anyone who has hung out in Australia knows what I mean. Of course I care and am competitive, but I am also going to do it while tossing back a beer."" Weirdest rock formations around the United States . 7. Vail, Colorado . Growing up in Kansas, Probst's family piled into the family station wagon for an annual ski vacation in Vail, Colorado. There's something about the Rockies that's completely familiar to him, down to the expressions on his parents' faces as they waited in line to rent skis. ""Our parents did that trip every year, and I can remember my dad telling me years later that family adventures and vacations are a lot of work ... but they are never not worth it,"" Probst says. ""I can remember all the times we loaded up in our station wagon to drive through the snow-covered mountains so we could have family vacations."" 8. El Toro Bay, Samoa . When Probst performed his parents' vow renewal ceremony for their 50th anniversary in Samoa in 2009, he had no idea he'd be returning for a similarly important event two years later. That's when he flew Lisa and her children to Samoa, where he was shooting season 19. When they arrived at El Toro Bay, he took Michael and Ava aside to let them know he was asking their mother to marry him and to ask for their help. The children quickly changed clothes and helped to lead her to Probst, who proposed. They married four months later. 9. Venice, California . While Probst spends a good amount of time traveling, he also very much appreciates what's available in his own backyard of Los Angeles, especially the beaches. ""There's such a fun vibe on the (Venice) boardwalk with some great people-watching,"" he says. ""All kinds of people show up: businessmen, surfers, moms, kids, all creating a crazy rhythm. The rings in Venice are a great little escape ... I just chalk up and swing away."" 10. Around the world . You'd think Probst and his family would be tired of him traveling when he gets home from shooting halfway around the world. You'd be wrong. Standing in front of the 10-foot by 6-foot map in their hallway, with pushpins marking where everyone has been, the family keeps talking about taking a month to go around the world. Where would they stop? For sure, Rome, London and Switzerland. The rest of the trip is still up in the air. While he knows there's plenty he hasn't yet explored at home, ""the other view is we have just one shot, and let's say by plane, by train, by bus, by car, by scooter, by skateboard, we're going to experience the world,"" he says. ""Do we learn something we want to bring back home? Or did we find we are perfectly happy with the way things are?""

"(CNN) -- For those of us still religiously watching reruns of ""Boy Meets World,"" great news: TVLine reports that the Disney Channel is considering a sequel series, ""Girl Meets World,"" that would focus on the adolescent daughter of Ben Savage's Cory Matthews and Danielle Fishel's Topanga Lawrence. Word has it Disney is also trying to get Matthews and Fishel to return to portraying Cory and Topanga, and Fishel raised our hopes by tweeting November 3, ""Just want you guys to know that @BenSavage and I have talked and we've decided ... Thanksgiving is going to be delicious this year!"" While we wait to see whether Disney will make a ""Boy Meets World"" update a reality, let's catch up with the cast: . Ben Savage (Cory Matthews) Ben Savage played the mischievous Cory Matthews from 1993-2000, going from sixth-grader to college student and newlywed. Following ""Boy Meets World"" series finale, Savage went on to graduate from college in real life, earning a degree in political science from Stanford in 2004. The now 32-year-old has continued to act, both in movies like 2007's ""Palo Alto, CA,"" and with appearances on shows such as ""Without a Trace,"" ""Bones,"" ""Chuck"" and ""Shake It Up!"" William Daniels (George Feeny) William Daniels' George Feeny was one of the most beloved adult characters on ""Boy Meets World,"" playing a teacher/principal/next-door neighbor and voice of reason to Cory Matthews. Daniels moved on from following Cory throughout his educational career to landing roles on ""Touched by an Angel,"" ""The Closer"" and ""The King of Queens."" Most recently, 85-year-old Daniels appeared on the ninth season of ""Grey's Anatomy"" as Dr. Craig Thomas. Rider Strong (Shawn Hunter) It's unknown if Cory's best friend, Shawn Hunter, would be in consideration for a potential new series, but we sure hope so. The character, with his leather jacket and floppy haircut that turned actor Rider Strong into a major crush for fans, appeared in all 158 episodes of ""Boy Meets World."" After the series ended in 2000, Strong continued acting in shows such as ""Kim Possible"" and ""Pepper Dennis,"" and movies such as 2002's ""Cabin Fever."" The Columbia grad (English, '04) and Bennington College M.F.A. has moved behind the camera as of late, having written and directed projects along with his brother, Shiloh, such as 2008's ""Irish Twins."" Betsy Randle (Amy Matthews) After playing the mom of Cory Matthews, Amy, Betsy Randle has kept a low profile. The married actress and mom of two was last spotted on the now-defunct series ""Charmed"" in 2004. Will Friedle (Eric Matthews) Will Friedle played Cory Matthews' lovably dense older brother, Eric, for seven years. Once the show ended, Friedle kept up a career on the small screen, although viewers might not have recognized him. Now 36, he's done voice work on ""Batman Beyond,"" ""Kim Possible,"" ""The Penguins of Madagascar"" and ""Thundercats"" as Lion-O. William Russ (Alan Matthews) William Russ, now 62, moved on from playing even-keeled dad (and pretty randy husband!) Alan Matthews to roles in both daytime (""The Young and the Restless"") and primetime (""Boston Legal""). He's most recently appeared on the CBS new series ""Vegas."" Danielle Fishel (Topanga Lawrence) Danielle Fishel came to fame playing '90s dream girl Topanga Lawrence, who went from aggravating know-it-all to Cory Matthews' sweetheart and, at series end, his wife. Fishel tried her hand at film with ""National Lampoon Presents Dorm Daze"" after the series ended, but has moved away from acting in recent years. The 31-year-old has served as a special correspondent on ""The Tyra Banks Show,"" as host of Style's ""The Dish,"" and now appears on MSN TV's ""Last Night on TV.""

"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Samar Badawi, a 30-year-old mother of one, has served seven months in jail. Her crime? Disobeying her father. Badawi, 30, fell foul of Saudi Arabia's guardianship laws, which require women to gain permission from their father, husband or even adult son for many daily activities. In a case that was highlighted by Human Rights Watch, Badawi was physically abused by her father from the age of 14 after her mother died of cancer. At the age of 25, she decided to ""stand up for herself"" and ran away to a women's shelter. She was jailed for seven months after her father brought a ""disobedience"" case against her and she refused to return to his home. Badawi was released last year after an online campaign, and eventually got a ruling to transfer her guardianship to her uncle. She also successfully filed a suit against her father's refusal to allow her to marry. ""I went in a broken woman,"" she said. ""I was very hurt when I went to prison. But I came out victorious and was very proud of myself that I was able to handle those seven months. It wasn't easy."" Badawi added: ""When I was alone, I would remember the injustice, from my father, from the judge who was horrible to me. ""I would remember my son. I would remember how even society didn't spare me -- I was insulted a lot and despite the insults, I stayed quiet, I didn't respond. In these moments I would cry."" Despite her own trauma, Badawi does not call for a change in the law, but rather for better awareness. ""Our laws are fair, very fair,"" she said. ""If not for the law, I would not have been able to escape the difficult situation I was in. ""The problem is that there is no legal culture here. Women here, from various backgrounds, aren't aware of their rights, there is no awareness. ""That's why I wish that law would be taught in schools from an early age."" Badawi was presented with an International Women of Courage award by U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton on March 8. Presented annually, the award recognizes women who have show exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for women's rights. Women's rights is a hot issue in Saudi Arabia, and there is a surprising range of views, from both women and men. Aside from the guardianship laws, women are not allowed to drive, an issue that grabbed headlines around the world last year when many women challenged the law by getting behind the wheel. One of those was Najla Hariri, who drove her son to school one day after her driver failed to show up for work. She continued to do so several times after that, but can no longer drive after she and her husband were both forced to sign legal pledges that she would not drive again. ""What is more upsetting to me than having to sign the pledge is that my 'guardian' was summoned,"" she said. ""I reject the whole idea of his being my 'guardian' because I'm a 47-year-old woman, I should be my own guardian."" For Hariri, there is far more to campaign for than driving. ""Saudi women are facing many problems -- divorced women, women in judicial limbo, women who have been abused, issues with inheritance distribution -- we have many problems. ""So we started calling for the establishment of a 'personal status law' to protect these rights,"" she added. Hariri said the rights she wants are those already given to women in the Quran and the Sunna, the teachings of Prophet Mohammed. Also on Inside the Middle East: Saudi's new breed of artists push the limits . But not everyone agrees. Rawda Al Youssef runs a campaign called ""My Guardian Knows What's Best For Me"" in favor of the controversial system. She argues that Saudi women are lucky to be looked after and that guardianship reinforces the family as a foundation of society. ""The relationship between men and women inside the family is a complementary relationship and not an equal relationship,"" said Al Youssef. ""The man serves the woman and supervises her affairs inside the home and outside the home."" For Al Youssef, women who campaign for more rights are a pampered minority with no real problems. ""Saudi women -- specifically those who are talking about women's rights -- these come from a social class that is well-off and pampered. ""Bring me a poor woman who talks about these things and I'll say ok, maybe she needs this, but those who talk about women's rights ... these are women who have everything they need and all they're missing is to be able to take their passport and travel as they want, or to drive a car. ""They didn't think about the needs of the poorer class."" While Al Youssef believes there is no appetite from either King Abdullah or society at large for greater women's rights, Samar Fatany is convinced of the opposite. Fatany, a radio journalist and writer on women's issues who was one of the first women employed in government 30 years ago, believes change will be inevitable, though gradual. ""I think Saudi women really have a great opportunity and a window for change and progress that we really need to take advantage of,"" she said. ""I think King Abdullah has been a great supporter of women, he has been the champion of women and as a result the whole nation has changed and given great support to women."" Fatany added: ""It takes an educated person to know a different way of life, that it doesn't have to be that way. ""If you are a person who is isolated and this is a lifestyle that you know, it doesn't occur to you that there's another way, that you don't have to accept that. This doesn't have to do with religion. ""It is not un-Islamic to drive, it's is not un-Islamic to work, it is not un-Islamic to demand for your rights."" Also on Inside the Middle East: 'Victims of injustice' in post-revolution Egypt speak out . Cleric Sheikh Adnan Bahareth, who insisted on being interviewed over the phone because he did not want to appear on camera with a woman, argued that Saudi women were lucky not to have to drive. ""Men are slaves for women today,"" he said. Sheikh Bahareth said if women could drive: ""It will add more tasks on a woman's shoulder. She will have to go to the souk on her own, she will have to get the food, she will have to drive the kids to and from school. ""We want to lessen these burdens on the women.""","Samar Badawi served seven months in jail for disobeying her father .

"Gaza (CNN) -- When Jwdat Abu Ghrb spotted a dark shape last summer in the waters off Gaza, where he was diving for fish, he initially thought it was a corpse. ""I was afraid,"" he told CNN. ""I put on my goggles, dove underneath and still couldn't tell what it was. I resurfaced and got some help from other people and family members and came back, and after full four hours of trying we managed to get it out of the water and I was shocked by what I found."" It was a life-size bronze statue, believed to be a 2,500-year-old depiction of the ancient Greek god Apollo. He described the half-ton object as ""treasure pulled out of the sea."" ""I thought it was made of gold; I was going to be rich,"" Ghrb said. ""So I took it home to hide it."" But then others got involved. A local armed brigade took control of the statue, and someone listed it for sale on the online auction site eBay, with a starting price of about $500,000, according to authorities. The posting raised suspicions among officials in the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the Interior Ministry in Gaza, which is governed by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. The antiquities authority and the Interior Ministry opened an investigation into what they said they suspected was an illegal attempt to sell the work of art. ""It is against the law to sell an artifact found in the Palestinian territories and Gaza in an illegal manner,"" Ahmad Al-Burch, head of the antiquities department at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in Gaza, told CNN. He said the case was being handled by the Ministry of the Interior, while the antiquities authority looks after the statue. Authorities there asked that the statue, as a historical artifact found in Gaza, be handed over; they have hidden it from public view. But in a Gaza gold store, a man who displayed video of the statue told CNN that he has custody of it and that it is in safe hands, but -- if someone wants to buy it -- that would be possible. Government officials promise that the statue will not be sold and that they will start restoration and display it after an investigation into its discovery is completed. ""We are not denying that the statue was found in the sea -- as a matter of fact, that is a very authentic and real story,"" Al-Burch said. A green spot -- a sign of decay -- has formed on the leg of the statue, which is exposed to the air. ""We are trying to preserve the statue to show it for the public in the near future."" He said the antiquities authority was working on a plan for the statue to be displayed in world-class museums around the world. Museum authorities in Geneva, Switzerland, have offered to help repair and preserve the statue, and plan for its eventual display in Gaza, he said. For Ghrb and his family, the discovery seems unlikely to land them the financial security they had hoped for with a sale. They are instead hoping to net a reward for the find, which has excited archaeologists around the world. CNN's Kareem Khadder in Jerusalem and Laura Smith-Spark in London contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Treasure pulled out of the sea""

"(CNN) -- A Frenchwoman kidnapped from her holiday home in northern Kenya and taken to Somalia has died, the French Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. A gang of 10 armed men seized Marie Dedieu this month from her home on Manda Island, prompting a sea battle between Kenyan forces and her abductors. Kenyan officials sent mediators into Somalia a day later to negotiate her release. Dedieu lived in a luxury home on the scenic Lamu archipelago for about six months out of the year. Kenyan officials and an acquaintance said the woman, in her 60s, used a wheelchair and was not in good health. ""The contacts through which the French government was trying to release Marie Dedieu ... have announced her death,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding the date and circumstances of the death cannot be specified. The ministry said Dedieu's death ""is almost sure"" even if it does not have her body. ""She was an ill and disabled woman,"" Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said. ""This is therefore a deeply barbaric and violent act. France condemns firmly this act."" ""Marie Dedieu's health, the uncertainty about the conditions of her detention, the fact that the abductors had probably refused to give her the medication we had sent her, make us think that this tragic end is unfortunately the most plausible one,"" the ministry statement said. Dedieu's friends and relatives have been notified, it said. ""The French government wants to say that it is deeply moved, saddened and that it supports Marie Dedieu's relatives,"" the statement said. ""The government also wants to express its indignation following the complete lack of humanity and cruelty from the abductors of our compatriot. We want them to be identified and brought to justice."" The statement said the government is requesting ""the repatriation of our compatriot's body."" The Kenyan government sent its condolences to Dedieu's ""family, friends and colleagues"" in a statement Wednesday. ""The kidnapping and detention of Marie Dedieu was a terror act not only against her, but also against Kenya, her home country France and the entire world,"" the statement said. ""... The Kenyan government thanks the French government and the people of France for their continued support even during this moment of loss."" Dedieu's abduction was the second in the area in a month, a major blow to Kenya, which relies on tourism dollars. Gunmen seized British tourist Judith Tebbutt and killed her husband near Lamu last month. Security analysts have said Tebbutt is being held by pirates in a remote corner of Somalia. British government officials have asked journalists not to reveal her exact location to avoid abduction attempts from rival gangs. France and Britain warned travelers to avoid the Kenyan coastline near Somalia in the wake of the abductions. Kenyan officials have said they believe the kidnappings are carried out by the Al-Shabaab Somali militant group. A third incident involved the kidnapping of two Spanish aid workers at the Dadaab refugee camp last week. Kenyan forces crossed into Somalia this week to pursue the militant fighters after the kidnappings heightened tensions in East Africa. In the statement Wednesday, the Kenyan government said operations against Al-Shabaab were continuing.","NEW: The Kenyan government sends condolences over Marie Dedieu's death .

"New York (CNN) -- A federal judge has approved a $41 million civil rights settlement to five black and Hispanic men wrongfully convicted in the horrific beating and rape of a white female jogger in New York's Central Park in 1989, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement Friday. The sensational case polarized the city along racial lines and became emblematic of a state of rampant crime. Five minority teenagers, who became known as the Central Park Five, were coerced amid public uproar into making incriminating statements and convicted in 1990. ""This settlement is an act of justice for those five men that is long overdue,"" de Blasio said in the statement. ""We can finally put this case behind us, and these five men and their families can begin to heal these wounds and move forward."" The agreement between the city law department and the five men -- who served between seven and 13 years in prison -- averaged about $1 million per year of incarceration, was reached in June. One of the men, Kharey Wise, served 13 years in prison. Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Raymond Santana Jr. each served about seven years. The approval of a federal judge in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where the men filed their civil rights lawsuit, was the final step for the settlement to take effect. On April 19, 1989, a 28-year-old Wall Street investment banker jogging through Central Park was raped, viciously beaten and left for dead. She would have no memory of the attack. That same night, a group of black and Latino boys had been in the park, throwing rocks at cars and assaulting people in a practice the media and law enforcement at the time called ""wilding."" An investigation led to the arrest of five teens who were accused of rampaging through the park in a ""wolf pack"" and preying on innocent victims. They were charged and convicted. The victim, Trisha Meili, kept her identity hidden for 14 years until the publication of her book, ""I Am the Central Park Jogger."" Three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms, one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer in 2002 confessed to the crime and said he had acted alone. DNA analysis later determined that Reyes did rape the jogger and that hair evidence used in the boys' trials did not match. Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney at the time, ordered a new investigation and, on his recommendation, a judge vacated the convictions. ""To the extent that the evidence suggests that these five young men were wrongfully convicted and sentenced to substantial prison terms for a crime they did not commit, that in and of itself constitutes an injustice in need of redress,"" Corporation Counsel Zachary Carter said in a statement Friday. But Carter said the settlement ""should not be construed as an acknowledgment that the convictions ... were the result of law enforcement misconduct."" ""On the contrary, our review of the record suggests that both the investigating detectives and the Assistant District Attorneys involved in the case acted reasonably, given the circumstances with which they were confronted,"" he said. ""In the end, however, that is an issue that would ultimately be determined by a jury at trial, absent a settlement of this litigation. We have determined that a resolution of this matter is in the best interests of the City.""

"(CNN) -- Ruta Meilutyte's initial brush with swimming as a seven-year-old in Lithuania could never have foretold her success in the pool. ""I remember in my first session I jumped into the deep end and nearly drowned,"" Meilutyte told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""My coach kind of saved me."" One can safely say that she has gotten much, much better. Only eight years after that frightening experience, Meilutyte became her country's maiden Olympic gold medalist in swimming by upsetting the reigning world champion in the 100-meter breaststroke at London 2012. However, her path to success and ""rock star"" status in Lithuania, as her coach put it, hasn't been an easy one. Still not officially classified as an adult, she has had to deal with the death of her mother, who was hit by a car when Meilutyte was four and barely out of diapers. She was also forced to adapt to a new country when she left Lithuania for England in 2009, a life-altering move instigated by her father who thought his daughter's prospects in both swimming and academics would improve. He was right. Meilutyte trains in Plymouth, southwest England, and goes to the same school attended by Tom Daley, a bronze medalist in diving for Great Britain in 2012. Her coach Jon Rudd calls her a ""great scholar."" In Lithuania, the pool is ""not great,"" Meilutyte said. ""We don't have a good training facility. Also it's really hard to combine school with swimming. You either do one or the other. ""We just decided to go to England because it would be a great time to balance school and swimming at the same time as college. Yes Lithuania and England are really a bit different, the people are different, but I got used to it really fast."" It's indeed apparent that Meilutyte, a bubbly blonde, is a quick learner. Although she says the breaststroke was ""natural"" for her, it wasn't her original specialty. ""I did it once for a laugh, because I was a freestyler, and it went really well,"" Meilutyte said. ""So I kept competing in it and training until I got better and better. ""It's quite a tough stroke but I really like it. It's like a frog stroke."" She used to ""mess about"" in training and only took swimming seriously when she broke a national record in her age group. That's when something clicked. She liked the feeling winning brought, and pushed herself further. Still, not many, including Meilutyte herself, expected her to claim gold at the Olympics. In a sport where half a second is a sizable progression, Meilutyte shaved about two seconds off her personal best in London, raising her level when it mattered most. In the final, Meilutyte edged American 2011 world champion Rebecca Soni -- someone she looked up to as a role model -- by 0.08 seconds. Australia's Leisel Jones, one of the leading swimmers of her generation, was in the final, too. ""It was all really surreal for quite a while,"" Meilutyte said. ""It takes a while to sink in because my mind wasn't preparing for anything like that. I never told myself I would win a medal."" Soni would later win gold in the 200m breaststroke in London to successfully defend her 2008 Olympic title from Beijing. ""I always looked up to her,"" Meilutyte said. ""Being there with all the best swimmers of the world is something I always dreamed of."" Now Meilutyte, at 16, is a role model. Rudd said a breakout performance from Meilutyte had been ""brewing for a while"" and that there was nothing sinister behind her incredible improvement -- Chinese teen Ye Shiwen had to rebut accusations of possible drug use after her own world-record performances at London 2012. ""We didn't realistically know what she would do,"" Rudd said in July, following Meilutyte's victory. ""Her breaststroke was pretty tidy and we tidied it up even more. ""She is a talented and vigilant worker. When you've got talent and work ethic, you've got a great kid."" Along with putting in the hours, Meilutyte is a fierce competitor. For her, finishing second isn't good enough. ""I think I am really competitive in everything,"" she said. ""I love racing, I love winning, I hate losing. I think that's one of the properties I've got and one of the things that push me in training. ""I've got goals I want to achieve."" As hard of a worker as Meilutyte is, she does admit that it's not easy leaving her warm bed for a cold pool in Plymouth to begin her day. The usual starting time for training is 5:30 a.m., when most of her fellow students are sleeping. She usually trains 30 hours per week overall -- the toughest parts are the extended non-stop cardio sessions -- but must fulfill her commitments as a fulltime student. Sometimes she struggles to stay awake in the classroom. It's no surprise that Meilutyte doesn't have much time to hang around with friends. ""You don't have much time to socialize,"" she said. ""I have to train early so I can't stay up late, so obviously the social life gets affected a bit. But I don't mind. ""You get into a routine with it. It all becomes a bit easier. There is an outcome at the end of this. It is worth it."" As for fast food and the like, it's off limits. Well, mostly. ""I don't count my calories,"" Meilutyte added. ""I have to eat a lot, healthy food, not cakes, although I do like chocolate and cakes a lot."" Meilutyte's next major meet is next month's world championships in Barcelona, where she has a busy program competing in the 50m and 100m breaststroke, plus the 50m and 100m freestyle. And yes, Meilutyte will continue to represent Lithuania, the former Soviet republic -- though she is sometimes asked if she wants to switch nationalities after spending four years in Britain. ""Some of my teammates from Lithuania also don't train in Lithuania,"" she said. ""It doesn't really matter where you train -- as long as you go to competition and you have the Lithuanian T-shirt on, you are representing your country. ""That's what I train for, to represent my country, and I want the world to know about it."" The world has gotten to know Ruta Meilutyte, and there could be more to come.","Ruta Meilutyte says getting out of bed is difficult but she does it because she loves swimming .

In a statement Wednesday night, Wolff described the four hosts as ""powerful and accomplished women from different walks of life who have had amazing personal and professional experiences."" ""Each brings incredible perspective and information to the table. This mix of smart, vibrant and energetic women is unlike anything else on daytime television."" ""The View"" faces challenges from a growing number of other daytime panel-style programs, including ""The Talk"" on CBS and the forthcoming syndicated show ""The Real."" There had been speculation that ABC might decide to add a man to what has been an all-women show since its inception in 1997. Ultimately the network went with star power over testosterone.

"(CNN) -- I was living in Syria when the statues of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq came toppling down. Saddam, who had arrogantly had his name inscribed on bricks at the ancient city of Babylon, did not expect his rule to end so abruptly, so humiliatingly. And at the University of Damascus, students told me that they expected Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to fall soon, too. They were not alone. With 250,000 U.S. troops amassed in Iraq in 2003, George W. Bush's White House had contemplated rolling American tanks into the Syrian capital. The Middle East was to be reshaped in the image of American democracy. But events in Iraq, Afghanistan, and North Korea distracted the Pentagon, and the ""democratic domino theory"" did not come to pass. Ten years after Iraq, did the war give birth to the Arab Spring? Yes, the Iraq War had indirect connections to the Arab uprisings that swept the Middle East and northern Africa in 2011. For one, the fall of Saddam must have psychologically empowered Arab opposition activists who saw that a Ba'thist dictator and his sons could be removed from power. FULL COVERAGE: The Iraq War, 10 years on . But it is a mistake to suggest that Arabs across the region were directly inspired by the fall of Saddam -- if that were true, they would have risen a decade ago. Why wait until 2011? The answer is that other, more direct developments led to the ongoing Arab revolutions. First, in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 atrocities, Arab governments used the ensuing ""war on terror"" to quell domestic dissent. When opposition Islamist parties questioned the legitimacy of Arab dictators, they were portrayed as al Qaeda sympathizers to the West, and their imprisonment in Cairo or Riyadh or Tripoli didn't raise international eyebrows. The violence of radical Islamists failed to topple strongmen in Egypt and Syria in the 1960s and 1980s. And once again, from 2001 to 2011, government repression of less radical, nonviolent Islamists signalled to a younger generation of Arabs that Islamism could not overthrow autocratic regimes. WATCH NOW: Iraq's phantom WMD . Second, as the ""war on terror"" unfolded, Islamists continued to fail in their decades-long pursuit to gain political office, and the widespread corruption and nepotism of regimes in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt sunk deeper, US support for Arab dictatorships also came into question. Then U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice put it best in June 2005: ""For 60 years, my country, the United States, pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region here in the Middle East, and we achieved neither."" These were not just empty words. The U.S. government identified civil society organizations and financially supported NGOs through the ""democracy promotion"" agenda. During the Bush administration, annual funding for these programs exceeded the total amount spent on such programs in the entire decade to 2001, according to the 2009 budget report from the Project on Middle East Democracy. Funding for the mostly secular democracy activists was bolstered by the training provided for them in use of social media in mobilizing people. The invention and popularity of Facebook and Twitter helped young Arabs bypass communications controlled by their dictators. Even if this U.S.-funded training in creating political parties, electioneering, communication and media training only reached a small portion of the population, is it any wonder that English-speaking, elite, urban Arabs took to Facebook and Twitter to help overthrow dictators? Yes, there were local grievances and the uprisings were homegrown. The Arab uprisings belong to the Arab youth. But they were also responding by using modern technology to amplify the mood music of Western belief that Arabs too could create free societies. They were not an exception. WATCH: Lingering effects of war on Iraqis . Why else were Arab protesters' attention focused on the Obama White House as they demanded the president call on Mubarak to depart? As Turkey pressured the White House to oppose Mubarak, Saudi Arabia pressured Obama to support Mubarak -- and in that way the uprisings revolved to some degree around the messages sent from the U.S. government. The Arab Spring was going to happen with or without Saddam Hussein, but it would not have happened had it not been for the attacks of September 11. In fact, in many ways the Iraq War has prevented more from being done to aid the uprisings, hindering global resolve in attending to the killing fields of the full-blown civil war in Syria. OPINION: Media's failure on Iraq still stings . It is the ghost of Iraq that prevents the U.S. from leading attempts to topple the brutal Assad regime in Damascus. Regime change has consequences, as we learned in Iraq. There will be no new commitments to ""nation build"" again, or re-train police and security forces in a far off Arab land. The sectarianism, tribalism, Jihadism, border skirmishes and threat of chemical weapons use in Syria reminds U.S. policymakers of the American and Arab blood and treasure sacrificed in Iraq. And to what avail? The ongoing loss of life in Syria is a direct result of U.S. foreign policy blunders in Iraq. Syrians are the victims of America's Iraq adventure. So as we ponder the last decade and current Arab uprisings, let us not gloat about the ""success"" of Iraq. Iraq is not a success. It is now an ally of Iran, home to a prime minister who persecutes his own political opposition, and unashamedly supports the Assad regime in Syria. Egyptians, Yemenis, Libyans, and Tunisians were not inspired by America in Iraq. The opinions expressed in this opinion piece are solely those of Ed Husain.","Husain: Fall of Saddam Hussein pyschologically empowered Arab opposition .

"(CNN) -- Distribution of food, seed and medical relief intended for drought victims in Somalia has been suspended, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced Thursday. The aid intended for up to 1.1 million people has been held up because local authorities blocked distribution of ICRC food and seed relief in the Middle Shabelle and Galgaduud regions in central and southern Somalia, according to a statement by the organization. ""We are actively seeking the cooperation of the local authorities to restore conditions that will allow the resumption of the suspended activities as soon as possible,"" said Patrick Vial, the head of the ICRC delegation for Somalia. According to the ICRC statement, the organization has distributed food relief to more than 1 million people and agricultural support to more than 100,000 farmers. In addition, the ICRC has helped treat more than 170,000 severely malnourished children and made health care more available in remote areas, the statement said. Last month, two attacks on aid workers in Somalia killed five people -- two from Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, and three from the U.N. World Food Programme. The African Union Mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, is trying to consolidate power for Somalia's weak transitional federal government in Mogadishu, the capital, where Islamic militants had been especially active in their battle against that government. AMISOM forces reported in late December they had successfully pushed the Al-Shabaab movement out of Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab is linked to al Qaeda and is considered a terrorist group by the United States.","The aid is intended to help more than 1 million drought victims .

"Zhouqu County, China (CNN) -- Chinese soldiers frantically dug through the mud with shovels, even with their bare hands, Tuesday to reach the second story of an apartment building in northwestern Zhouqu County. After 60 hours trapped under mud, Liu Ma Shendeng was alive. The soldiers pulled out the 52-year-old man, a rare moment of joy in a search for survivors in which hope was fast diminishing. The death toll doubled Tuesday to 702 people in massive mudslides triggered Sunday by rain in China's Gansu province, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Another 1,042 people are still missing. The side of a mountain broke off in the darkness of night and tore through remote Zhouqu, burying many homes and ripping others apart. The path of the mudslide is now covered in three and four stories of rock and mud. Some buildings, including the police department and a primary school, were flattened by the wall of mud. Others toppled over or vanished completely, buried under sludge many feet deep. ""There was a noise like thunder and then it came down from the sky,"" said one woman, who did not want to be identified. ""There was no way to escape."" Liu was bedridden and too weak to talk. But he represented a miracle in this place of utter devastation. Thousands of soldiers, policemen, firefighters and medics worked to search for survivors, the sounds of heaving and digging punctuated by the mournful cries of those who realized they have lost their loved ones. In some cases, entire families were buried alive. ""My sons are buried here,"" said Wang XuiQing, who stood with his wife, Yang Renhai, on a mound of earth that smothered their two-story home. The couple's parents were inside along with their two sons. ""What is there to feel?"" Wang said sobbing. Chen Jianhua, an official in Zhouqu, said 218 injured people had been treated at local hospitals, and 41 severely injured survivors had been transferred for treatment in the provincial capital of Lanzhou, according to Xinhua. China's rainy season started with a vengeance in early May and has brought the worst flooding in a decade. And more rain is forecast in the next few days. Some of the rocks and debris from the mudslide landed in the middle of the Bailong River that snakes through the area. The river overflowed and inundated low-lying neighborhoods. The government has been using explosives to break up the river debris, in an attempt to gradually release the water safely. On land, the dead were wrapped in blankets and carried out on stretchers or planks of wood. Bodies lined the streets and a makeshift morgue where family members came to identify the dead. Even for those who survived the mud, the future looks empty and uncertain. ""Now I have to rely on the government,"" said a man who lost his home and several relatives. ""I don't even have a pair of chopsticks to eat with."" In Washington, China's disaster elicited sympathy from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""The United States is providing support for the ongoing relief efforts through assistance to the Red Cross Society of China,"" she said in a statement. ""To those affected by this tragedy and to all the people of China, we send our heartfelt condolences.""","Soldiers rescued a man trapped for 60 hours under the mud .

"(CNN) -- Remember the time United Airlines broke a guitar? Dave Carroll does. He's the musician who three years ago turned his misfortune into an Internet sensation. His video, ""United Breaks Guitars,"" got a million views in just four days and prompted the airline to offer him compensation. But despite struggling with the airline for months, Carroll turned down the money because he wanted something bigger: he wanted to reform the system. Carroll is not the first angry customer to take his complaints online. Rants abound on video sharing sites; many feature nothing more than the offended party on a webcam spinning a tale of woe. That's what made Carroll's video stand out. The Canadian crooner spent seven months putting together a song and video. His real time and real talent combined to make something that people could really enjoy. ""If you are ranting or raving, people will listen for a second, but they won't want to join your cause,"" Carroll explains. After months of struggling with United, that's what Carroll had -- a cause. HLN's Clark Howard has a cause, too. He covers all things consumer-related and to Carroll's advice, he suggests adding another element: ""Something that makes people laugh and makes them angry at the same time."" One Atlanta couple, Ken and Meredith Williams, recently learned first hand how this mix of outrage and humor can get the public on your side and sway a large corporation. Their story starts about six months ago when the newlyweds found themselves in a rather intractable situation trying to buy their first home. ""We knew that the people we were dealing with weren't hateful people,"" Meredith recalls, but along their 78-day odyssey they couldn't help but wonder. After meeting in graduate school, the couple got married and moved to Atlanta. Then came time to buy their first home. The two had good jobs, steady income and they wanted to buy a modest home within their financial reach. ""We put in an offer on September 8th. We wanted to close -- we were told we would close,"" Ken recalls. But when ""we came up to October 7th, and nothing was appearing to be falling place."" Sitting around their dining room table, Ken and Meredith rattle off all the missed deadlines and infuriating delays that tangled up their lives for weeks on end. They say paperwork wouldn't make it to the correct office, phone calls and e-mails would go unreturned. One of their bank contacts even quit and failed to pass along their file; ""her e-mails just started bouncing"" Meredith says, shaking her head at the memory. All the while the couple scrambled to meet the sellers' demands while living out of boxes. ""We were ready to unpack,"" Meredith says. Early on, when things first started going wrong, they saved e-mails. So after missing the projected closing date, with fees beginning to pile up and only radio silence from the bank, they turned their in-boxes into a weapon. ""I just thought we just have to do something -- there is some kind of power we can leverage"" Meredith says. So while she hit the keyboard to share the story on their blog, Ken picked up his guitar. Two hours later, he emerged, ""He was like, 'I wrote a song,' "" Meredith giggles. What started with a song became a custom video featuring the couple and their cats, pleading with Bank of America to the tune of ""Bret, You Got it Going On"" from the HBO show ""Flight of the Conchords."" ""The goal was never to get thousands of people to tweet,"" Meredith says. That's a good thing because the video didn't exactly go viral (nothing close to Carroll's million views), but it did get a good deal of attention. Local news outlets picked up the couple's story and within 48 hours, the bank got in touch. They now had the ear of top people at the bank. With that, their hopeless situation, weeks of unreturned phone calls and volumes of paperwork came to a close. ""We wrote the song on day 72 and posted it on day 74 and we closed on day 79,"" Ken says. Their prize, a charming brick bungalow on a quiet street, is small and neat. As the couple walk through, they sound like many new homeowners pointing out all the projects. ""There must have been a fire sale on molding"" says Meredith, gesturing toward the oak-filled kitchen. Some big things needed work too. The couple put in new wiring, duct work and plumbing. These projects aren't flashy or exciting, but the pair shows them off with pride. That construction, in part, explains what held up their loan, says Terry Francisco, a Bank of America spokesman. The Williamses applied for a 203(k) loan, which allows for renovations. Francisco says this type of loan can actually take some 90 days to close. Realtors and mortgage brokers confirmed that 203(k) loans typically take much longer to close than a standard loan. Francisco did apologize for other hang-ups in the Williams' case, and he said the couple's experience prompted ""a tightening of procedures"" at the bank. The combination of humor and an outrageous story got the Williams the attention they needed. The combination worked for Carroll too. His efforts not only got him offers of compensation but even now, three years on, he travels around the world bringing his mix of music and message to places such as Russia, Australia and soon South Africa. He also published a book about his experience and launched a website, Gripevine.com, that helps people elevate and escalate their problems. Looking back, both the Williamses and Carroll say the intent behind the video is as important to getting noticed as the message. ""I'm not against companies, I'm not trying to take down companies,"" Carroll says. Rather, they agree, it's about giving companies and the people who work for them the opportunity to make things right. But even if a viral video doesn't get you want you want, all three say the process affords a measure of control -- something they'd lost in what Carroll calls the ""customer service maze"" and Meredith called the ""black hole of customer service."" So it's no surprise that all three say they would make another video if they found themselves in a similar situation. For others contemplating going this route, Carroll says ""make sure that you are fair and you are articulate and you are creative and that your story resonates with other people."" It also doesn't hurt to be good with a guitar.","Meredith and Ken Williams made a video in exasperation after home loan delays .

"(CNN) -- The biggest waves in a decade are forecast to be rolling toward Hawaii this week, but many surfers are set to miss out on the chance to ride them. The National Weather Service in Hawaii said it expects waves 40-to-50-feet high to hit the north shore of Oahu on Wednesday, driven by ""a giant northwest swell."" Hawaii hasn't experienced waves that large since 2004, said Sam Houston, a forecaster with the weather service. A high-surf warning is in effect for much of the state until Friday morning and forecasters say ""giant breaking surf,"" dangerous currents and significant ""coastal inundation"" are possible. At first glance, the tall waves would appear to offer a golden opportunity for participants in a big wave surf contest that was scheduled to take place Wednesday on Oahu. But the organizers have postponed the event. They say that although the waves are expected to be pleasingly large, the wind conditions are no good. Eastern U.S. gets hit with bitter cold . ""We have taken all the time we can to assess the developments of the next big swell and it does not look favorable for us,"" said event organizer Glen Moncata. ""The size is there, but the quality is not, due to strong, adverse winds."" World's 50 best surf spots . Organizers of the big wave event said they will keep waiting until the end of February for ""just one day of quality surf"" when wave face heights reach around 40 feet. The contest is held in honor of Eddie Aikau, a famous Oahu lifeguard who was regarded as one of the best big wave surfers of the 1960s and '70s. Aikau disappeared in 1978 during a canoe expedition from Hawaii to Tahiti. The event -- the Quiksilver In Memory of Eddie Aikau big wave invitational -- isn't an annual occurrence. It has taken place eight times, starting in 1984. It was last held in December 2009 when Greg Long of California claimed victory. The invitees to this year's event include Long, Aiku's younger brother Clyde, 11-time world champion Kelly Slater and Carlos Burle, who gained global renown for surfing an enormous wave in Portugal last year. Not that all experienced big-wave surfers will be on the sidelines. Waves of up to 50 feet are sure to bring in towed-in surfers and spectators to Jaws, or Peahi, on Maui. ""It is a pretty awesome sight to see,"" said Anna Foust, emergency management officer on the island. She said such waves from the northwest are generally not a threat to Maui's infrastructure. Still, she advised residents to be cautious of the high surf and stay well back. Officials will be monitoring and will close beach parks, if necessary, she told CNN on Tuesday afternoon. Why such huge waves? A large storm with hurricane-force winds is spinning far north of the islands, but is sending a giant swell toward the warning areas, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. The big waves headed for Hawaii are also prompting concern among beachfront home owners whose houses risk being flooded or are on cliffs vulnerable to erosion. The American Red Cross says it has volunteers and supplies on standby for any homes that are affected, CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB reported. The high-surf warning area includes the north shore of Maui, the west shore of the Big Island, and the north and west shores of Oahu, Kauai and Molokai. While some shores may see waves of 40 to 50 feet, others may experience smaller waves of 20 to 30 feet. Surfers ride the storm in Europe .

"(CNN) -- March brought us a series of what pundits like to call ""provocations"" by North Korea. On closer inspection, Pyongyang has opted for rhetoric over actual military actions. While Kim Jong Un's pursuit of nuclear and missile capability remains worrisome, escalating signals of resolve could suggest nervousness as much as strength. So, is the regime in trouble? The first round of saber-rattling came as the U.N. Security Council deliberated on a new sanctions resolution after North Korea's satellite launch in December and its third nuclear test in February. The Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a party organ dealing with North-South relations began putting out public statements in an effort to chip away at the institutions of the armistice, such as military hot lines and the stationing of a North Korean military mission in Panmunjom. North Korea ultimately ""withdrew"" from the armistice, but it had done so before and it is not clear what its recent statements actually mean. The armistice is not a peace treaty, but merely a cease fire. The armistice is stable not because of verbal commitments but because of the deterrent capability of both sides. Is anything really different as a result of this ""re-withdrawal""? It doesn't seem like it. Equally unfortunate was North Korea's decision to renege on a number of North-South agreements, such as a North-South agreement on the denuclearization of the peninsula. But Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons had made this and a number of other agreements moot in any case. North Korea's bluster had little if any effect on the U.N. debate. If anything, its threats may have been counterproductive. Although the resolution was portrayed as the result of a U.S.-South Korean cabal, China also signed on and the resolution was passed unanimously. The measure opens the door for tighter financial sanctions, and there is some preliminary evidence that Beijing may be cooperating in tightening economic exchanges with the country. The next round of statements came as North Korea and the United States and South Korea entered an annual military training cycle. These periods are always fraught with tension, as Pyongyang denounces the routine exercises as provocative. As the country effectively mobilizes, the North Korean press is filled with pictures of Kim Jong Un directing the troops in exercises, some of which were reportedly manipulated with Photoshop to increase their effect. As a result of these exercises, there is some background of what might be called ""ritualized escalation"" at work. But North Korea did possibly make one major misstep in arguing that it might undertake a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Announcing an intention to pre-empt is dangerous because even small tactical movements can be misinterpreted. Needless to say, such statements have to be taken seriously, and, if anything, the United States and South Korea may have over-reacted by such a public display of force. In particular, the U.S. announced a major new ballistic missile defense initiative, training runs by B52 and B2 bombers, and an updated U.S.-ROK Combined Counter-Provocation Plan. In the last few days, the U.S. was again quite public about its deployment of jet fighters to the peninsula as well. There is a larger game at work here that probably centers on the difficult-to-read domestic politics of North Korea. It is by no means assured that Kim Jong Un has fully consolidated his authority. By ramping up rhetoric, but exercising restraint with respect to actual military actions, the regime can count on the fact that the United States and South Korea are not going to take the first step either. The result is that North Korea's exercises and threats of retaliation have been successful in deterring attack, even though none was coming. The regime can claim some sort of victory in staring down American threats in its two big political meetings this week, the timing of which suggest that some of the rhetoric has been driven by domestic politics. North Korea's nuclear and missile programs constitute problems that the five parties in the regionâ€”China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United Statesâ€”need to address through concerted action. But overheated rhetoric, however disconcerting, is not the same as an intention to attack. Coolly maintaining our deterrent and not over-reacting to hyperbole is the proper course of action. With luck, the leadership will pivot away from nuclear posturing toward economic reform, the main thing that the people of North Korea really need. Editor's note: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this essay said North Korea instead of the U.S. announced new military initiatives. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephan Haggard.","Stephan Haggard: North Korea is mostly bluffing in its threats against South Korea .

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- A Shabbat service is underway at the Ghihon Hebrew Research synagogue in the Jikwoyi suburb of Nigeria's federal capital territory. Fourteen year-old Kadmiel Izungu Abor heads there with his family. They walk alongside stray goats on a road covered in red dust and potholes, lined with open sewage. They are nearly 20 kilometers away from the modern multi-story office buildings and sprawling mansions in Nigeria's capital city of Abuja. About 50 people gather in the synagogue. They pray from the Siddur, they read from the Torah and as they chant, Abor's mellow alto begins to rise. In a country of 162 million people tensions often lead to violent uprisings between Christians and Muslims and being part of the religious minority can be an issue. But Abor wears his kippah and his identity with pride. ""I am a Jewish Igbo,"" he says. The Igbo are one of Nigeria's largest ethnic groups with population estimates ranging from 20 to 50 million. Abor is convinced that the Igbo's ancestors were Jews. ""The son of Yaakov, Jacob, [was] Gad and I learned that he was among those people who went out of Israel to exile,"" Abor says. ""So from there he had a son called Eri and a son gave birth to a son called Aguleri and that's how the Igbo race began."" From generation to generation, some Igbo have passed down various versions of a migration story framed around Jacob, a patriarch of Judaism. A popular version of the narrative holds that Gad, the seventh son of Jacob, had three sons who settled in present-day southeastern Nigeria, which is predominantly inhabited by the Igbo. Those sons, Eri, Arodi and Areli (as mentioned in the book of Genesis), are said to have fathered clans, established kingdoms and founded towns still in existence in southeastern Nigeria today, including Owerri, Umuleri, Arochukwu and Aguleri. Read More: The forgotten story of Zambia's Jewish settlers . Eze A.E. Chukwuemeka Eri, the king of a community in Aguleri, claims he presides over the throne of Gad's son, Eri. Wearing a white shirt with the Star of David stitched on the front, King Eri points to a calendar on the wall of his palace that lists the names of his 33 predecessors. He has no doubts that Eri is his ancestor. He has even acquired land to establish an educational center for the study of Jewish culture. ""Israelites and Igbos are brothers,"" he says with a broad smile. King Eri, like many, claims that the Igbo are the Jews of West Africa. They believe they are descendants of at least one of Israel's lost tribes. In the eighth century B.C. the Assyrians invaded Israel's northern kingdom forcing 10 tribes into exile. Historians say it is not unlikely that these tribes migrated westward to Africa. Throughout history, large populations of dispersed Jews also became ""lost"" through forced conversions and cultural assimilation. ""There is evidence that is scientific that the Igbos descended from the people that evolved in Israel,"" says Remy Ilona. He began investigating the stories from his youth more than a decade ago. ""When I grew up I heard, like virtually every Igbo here, that the Igbo people came from Israel,"" the Abuja-based lawyer says. His field work in Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Mali led him to conclude that Igbo and Jewish culture are not just similar, but ""identical."" In his latest book, Ilona draws parallels between Igbo rituals and customs and those practiced by Jews. Shared traditional practices include circumcising male children eight days after birth, refraining from eating ""unclean"" or tabooed foods, mourning the dead for seven days, celebrating the New Moon and conducting wedding ceremonies under a canopy. Some historians have noted that the Igbo were practicing these customs before their exposure to the Bible and missionaries. Daniel Lis, from the Institute for Jewish Studies, University of Basel, Switzerland, is one of the foremost researchers on Jewish identification among the Igbo. He says there has been a clear continuity of Jewish identity among the Igbo. ""It's not just something that happened yesterday,"" he says. The Swiss-Israeli anthropologist says that Igbo-Jewish identity can be traced back to the 18th century. Cross-cultural comparisons have been documented by people ranging from George Thomas Basden, the influential Anglican missionary and ethnographer who proposed that the word ""Igbo"" evolved as a corruption of the word ""Hebrew,"" to Olaudah Equiano, a freed Igbo slave living in 18th century British society. The oral stories and historic notations of cultural resemblances between the Igbo and the Jews have proven compelling enough to lure a diverse array of people to southeastern Nigeria. See also: CNN Belief Blog . Michael Freund, an American Jew based in Israel, is planning his first trip to Nigeria to get a first-hand look at the culture of the Igbo. ""I've read about them but of course there is nothing like actually hearing the stories of the people themselves,"" he says. Discovering ""lost"" Jewish communities around the world is what Freund does. He is the founder and chairman of the independent non-profit organization Shavei Israel. According to its media spokesperson Arik Puder, Shavei Israel is the only organization in Israel that focuses on finding descendants of the legendary lost tribes. He says the Israeli government does not recognize ethnic communities in various countries claiming to be descendants of lost tribes. ""They cannot prove that they have a Jewish grandfather or grandmother,"" Puder says. ""But they do have an interesting story."" Freund says he has received numerous letters and emails from Nigerians trying to connect to Israel. But with a rising number of groups around the world attempting to link their ancestry to the ancient Israelites, he is aware that some of those claims are ""wishful thinking."" He hopes that the future will yield strong genetic evidence to help the search for the lost tribes. ""As DNA technology improves there will be a growing stock of scientific evidence which can perhaps buttress the claims of an Israeli ancestry,"" he says. A 2012 documentary called ""Re-Emerging: The Jews of Nigeria"" featured the country's Jewish community. The film featured Rabbi Howard Gorin. He retired from the congressional rabbinate in 2012 after 32 years as the spiritual leader of a Jewish congregation in the U.S. state of Maryland. Gorin has played a significant role in the rise of Judaism in Nigeria since his first trip to the country in 2004. ""I embrace them and support them as brothers and sisters,"" he says. He ships books on Judaism to synagogues in Nigeria. Watch video: Lagos megacity . More support comes from groups like Kulanu, a New York-based non-profit group. Kulanu assists emerging Jewish communities around the world, like the one in Nigeria. But most of the Igbo who practice Judaism were not born to a Jewish mother and have not converted according to halakhah, Jewish law, so many Orthodox Jews would not recognize them. Even among Igbo people, the claim to be Jews elicits strong criticism. One critic, Catherine Acholonu, attributes Jewish identification among the Igbo as a result of Christianity brought by missionaries, since most Igbo people are Christians. ""Everybody is excited to say they belong to the people of the Bible because the Bible is reigning -- it's in,"" says Acholonu, a prominent researcher on Igbo history and culture. In her award-winning book ""They Lived Before Adam"" Acholonu proposes that Igbo civilization is older than that of the Israelites. She feels that Igbo people are whitewashing their history and diminishing the value of their own culture by attempting to link their heritage to the Jews. Peter Agbai, who says he is a ""proud Igbo man,"" strongly disagrees. He started practicing Judaism in 1991 after leaving the Methodist church. He says that the more he followed the commandments in the Torah, the more he realized that he was doing what his parents had always done as followers of traditional Igbo culture and spirituality. ""I have seen that the traditions of our people are similar to those in the Bible,"" says the 66-year-old, making references to aspects like ritual bathing and polygamy. Agbai is one of the founders of the Ghihon synagogue. He plays an important role as a spiritual leader in Abuja's community of Igbo Jews. He attended Abor's bar mitzvah last year, an experience that Abor says made him feel like a man, and feel closer to the Jewish culture. He wants to go deeper into Orthodox Judaism and take a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. ""I want to live in Israel,"" Abor says. He hopes that there, he will get a better understanding of his forefathers.","Among the Igbo people of Nigeria exists a small group of practicing Jews .

He didn't follow any one pre-established regimen to get there. A variety of books and lectures taught him about possible methods, and he tried different approaches until he found what worked for him. What he did specifically isn't necessarily the best method for everyone. ""Try to set up an experiment where you give yourself some time, and kind of hold yourself to it,"" he advises. ""If you screw up one day, that's in the past. Just pick yourself up and try again."" Sitting, the American way . Growing up in London, Almaer was very active. He played soccer and cricket in his youth. But when he went to college at the University of Minnesota, he got hooked on computers. He rebuilt the university's student registration system and worked for a start-up company while still in school. The price of technology was slothfulness. ""I started to move a lot less, and sit at a computer a lot more, and just ate crap all day long,"" he said. ""It kind of escalated from there."" Without fully realizing it, his diet turned to virtually all carbohydrates; he never ate vegetables. At the start-up company, he helped rig the soda machine so Mountain Dew would pour out even more concentrated. Being overweight seemed to bring down his immunity. He developed skin conditions. When he'd get a cough, it wouldn't go away for months. Over time, his weight ebbed and flowed. He got a little healthier while working in Boulder, Colorado. He lost a significant amount of weight when he and his wife moved to London, because he walked around the city and ate better. But when they relocated back to the United States, moving several more times, Almaer's weight swung upward again. Almaer boasts that he has lived in every time zone in the continental United States -- and most of them helped him gain weight. Target 1: Diet . Family members had been bugging Almaer for a long time about getting healthy. His father, a personal trainer and gym owner, was always in the back of Almaer's mind. But it was Gary Taubes, author of ""Why We Get Fat,"" who ultimately inspired him. Taubes taught Almaer that not all calories are alike -- it matters what you eat -- and that carbohydrates in particular are bad because they stimulate insulin, a hormone that increases fat storage. Controversy still surrounds the idea that a low-carb diet is healthier than a high-carb one (Robert Atkins' famous diet, for instance, is still hotly contested), but Almaer decided to try it. Almaer cut way back on his carbohydrates, then started adding some foods back into the diet to see how he did. He stayed away from processed foods. He also started paying more attention to his body's signals, only eating when he was hungry. Another technique he found useful at the beginning of this journey was taking a photo of food that he was about to consume, making him feel more ""in the moment"" during the act of eating. In conducting his personal experiments, Almaer didn't want to start with more than one variable at a time, so he didn't add in exercise until he felt he had a good handle on diet. With diet changes alone, he lost 20 pounds in two weeks. He created a mobile Web app called 16:8 to track the time between his meals, because he had read about the idea of intermittent fasting. He would simply hit a button when he started and stopped eating, so he could monitor how energetic he felt in connection with how much time had passed since eating. For instance, he has discovered that he feels great when he runs in the morning even if he's been fasting since the night before. Target 2: Exercise . When he felt his diet was under control, Almaer decided to try running, which he had never enjoyed. The first time, he could barely get to the end of the block. He paced himself by taking long walks, then got into a routine of ""run, walk, run."" The key here was to commit ahead of time to running every single day, and letting that habit form, he says. He didn't have to make a decision every day about whether to exercise -- he had already made that choice. Soon he was able to run three miles at a time. Then five. At first, he would listen to podcasts while running. But reading a book about meditative running -- ""Running with the Mind of Meditation"" by Sakyong Mipham -- changed his mindset. When he challenged himself to run without technology, he ran at least eight miles, and felt better than during any other run. He also got into meditation itself, which he found even harder than exercise because of the need to stay focused. Although exercise has brought him noticeable physical and mental health benefits, he calculates that from a pure weight loss perspective, 80% of his loss has been due to his food intake. What he eats . Today, Almaer continues to focus on minimizing carbohydrates and sugars, focusing instead on protein and vegetables. Typically, for breakfast, he'll have a veggie bacon omelet, with water to drink. Lunch could be a salad with meat on top, or even a burger without the bun. Dinner might be quinoa with chicken, with more salad. Almonds make a good snack. He'll have a cup or two of coffee in the morning to help boost his metabolism and take some of the hunger away. Sticking to his diet isn't always easy. He remembers breaking down at a child's birthday party and eating more cake. The family still often eats pizza on Friday nights, but these days Almaer only has one slice instead of four. He's also determined that having a ""cheat day"" isn't as effective as he thought; at first he enjoyed being able to indulge on his cheat day. But the day after would always be full of cravings. Now he keeps his ""cheat"" treats small, such as dark chocolate. How it feels . Living with 115 pounds less than last year, Almaer says he has much more energy throughout the day. He used to be a night owl; now he doesn't even need an alarm to wake up in the morning. The tiredness he used to feel after lunch is gone. His lung and skin problems have cleared up. And his mood is ""much more positive."" Weight loss has provided him with tangible evidence that he was able to make modifications to better himself, boosting his self confidence. It makes him think, ""Huh, I actually made a change, and it's actually working. What else do I want to do with my life?"" He's intent on staying healthy, not just for himself, but for his family. He wants to live long for them as a good role model. ""I can tell my kid a million times, eat your broccoli,"" he said. ""But if I'm there eating a pizza, it's just not going to work."" Almaer was brought to tears when, about eight months ago, his eldest son was at a friend's house and told his hosts he didn't want soda. He asked for water instead, ""because that's what Dad drinks,"" Almaer recalls. ""This is having a bigger effect than anything else that I can be doing,"" Almaer said. ""What are the things I can model, especially as a father, to a son? And it keeps kind of escalating from there."" When old photos of Almaer show up on the family's digital photo stream, his 4-year-old son Josh will shout ""There's Fat Daddy!"" or even, ""I never got to meet Fat Daddy."" The truth is, of course, Josh did meet Almaer when he was ""Fat Daddy."" He just doesn't remember when his father looked like that, only a year ago. The weight has been stored on the hard drive of the past. Have you lost weight? Submit your story to iReport .","Dion Almaer lost 115 pounds over the last year .

"Edinburgh, Scotland (CNN) -- UK Prime Minister David Cameron is campaigning in Scotland Wednesday in a last-minute bid to persuade voters to stick with the United Kingdom ahead of an independence referendum in eight days. Also north of the border are Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, partners with Cameron's Conservatives in the coalition government, and opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband. The trip comes as the latest opinion polls indicated that the pro-independence and pro-union campaigns are neck-and-neck. If Scotland's voters choose independence on September 18, it will mean the breakup of a 307-year-old union between England, Wales and Scotland as Great Britain. Cameron and Miliband canceled their usual weekly clash at Prime Minister's Questions in Parliament to make the trip. They are campaigning separately as they seek to win over the undecided voters who will be key to the outcome of the landmark vote. The Prime Minister appealed to the emotions in a speech to an audience in Edinburgh, saying, ""I care hugely about this extraordinary country, this United Kingdom, that we have built together."" He would be heartbroken, he said, ""if this family of nations was torn apart."" 'Last gasp piece of desperation' Opinion polls suggest the pro-independence ""yes"" campaign, led by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond of the governing Scottish National Party, has the momentum as the vote nears. Speaking to supporters Wednesday, Salmond said the politicians' visit from London was ""counterproductive"" for the ""no"" campaign and would be seen by Scotland as ""a last gasp piece of desperation from the Westminster establishment."" He added, ""I mean they're not popular in England, never mind popular in Scotland."" The latest poll of polls on Scottish independence shows the ""no"" camp hanging on to a narrow lead over the ""yes"" camp, but the gap continues to close. The poll of polls, by ScotCen, an independent research center, shows ""no"" at 52% and ""yes"" at 48%. Almost anyone living in Scotland age 16 or over on the day of the referendum will be able to vote. But voters in the rest of the United Kingdom -- England, Wales and Northern Ireland -- do not get a say on what could be a historic change. That includes Scots who live outside Scotland's borders. 'We desperately want you to stay' Cameron also used emotive language in an opinion piece published in the Daily Mail newspaper Wednesday in which he recalled the United Kingdom's historic achievements -- and promised that more are to come if it sticks together. ""Let no one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart,"" he wrote. ""Across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, our fear over what we stand to lose is matched only by our passion for what can be achieved if we stay together."" The three parties have all promised that Scotland, which already has devolved government, would be granted increased powers, for example over taxation and social welfare programs, if it votes to stay in the United Kingdom. ""There is a lot that divides us -- but there's one thing on which we agree passionately: the United Kingdom is better together,"" the three party leaders said in a joint statement Tuesday. ""We want to be listening and talking to voters about the huge choices they face. Our message to the Scottish people will be simple: 'We want you to stay.' "" Former PM warns of damage . A YouGov poll carried out Monday suggests that people in England and Wales are opposed to Scottish independence by a substantial majority, with 60% opposed to 19% in favor. Former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, writing Wednesday in the Times of London, warned that if Scotland votes for independence, it and all the United Kingdom would suffer as a result. ""The UK would be weaker in every international body and, most damagingly, within the European Union,"" he wrote. ""Our chance of reforming the EU would be diminished, and the risk of our exit from it enhanced."" Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on UK membership of the European Union by the end of 2017 if he remains Prime Minister after the general election next year. Campaigners for Scottish independence have said they want to remain part of the European Union. EU leaders have indicated that an independent Scotland would have to apply to join like any other nation. Will the oil last? The independence issue has polarized Scotland, with much argument over the potential economic costs or benefits, particularly with regard to the North Sea oil and gas found in Scottish waters. The Scottish government says it would manage the energy reserves better than the UK government, benefiting the Scottish people. But some experts have warned against over-reliance on a finite resource. Energy giant BP came out Wednesday against Scottish independence and voiced caution over North Sea prospects it described as ""smaller and more challenging to develop"" than before. ""Our business invests for decades into the future. It is important our plans are based on a realistic view of the North Sea's future potential and the challenges the industry faces in continuing to operate here,"" it said. ""As a major investor in Scotland -- now and into the future -- BP believes that the future prospects for the North Sea are best served by maintaining the existing capacity and integrity of the United Kingdom."" Queen 'is above politics' Buckingham Palace has made clear that Queen Elizabeth II will not take a position on the Scottish referendum amid UK media reports that lawmakers are urging her to intervene on behalf of the union. ""The Sovereign's constitutional impartiality is an established principle of our democracy and one which the Queen has demonstrated throughout her reign,"" a palace statement said. ""As such, the Queen is above politics, and those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case. ""Any suggestion that the Queen should wish to influence the outcome of the current referendum campaign is categorically wrong. This is a matter for the people of Scotland."" The queen would remain head of state of an independent Scotland. CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Edinburgh and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Max Foster, Alexander Felton and Carol Jordan contributed to this report.","NEW: PM Cameron says he would be heartbroken by split as he campaigns in Edinburgh .

"(CNN) -- Discovery Channel has canceled its planned live coverage of the May 11 jump off Mount Everest by a California daredevil in his wingsuit, the U.S. cable network announced. It was unclear Monday night whether climber and parachutist Joby Ogwyn still planned to leap off the top of the world's highest peak after his guides died in last week's avalanche that killed 13 people. At first, the stuntman told his fans on Facebook that he was sticking with his plans even though his Sherpas were killed. Ogwyn wrote Sunday that he and his team ""are staying on the mountain to honor our friends and complete our project."" But the post appeared to have been deleted Monday. Friday's avalanche was the single deadliest incident on Everest. Three other people were missing and at least half a dozen were hurt in the slide, which occurred just above a base camp more than 20,000 feet above sea level. All 50-plus climbers engulfed in the slide were Nepalese locals and Sherpas who were taking food and supplies to base camps on the the 29,000-foot peak, authorities reported. Ogwyn reported afterward that he was safe and mourned his lost team. ""These men were the salt of the Earth. Far better men than me. My heart is broken,"" he wrote. On Sunday afternoon, the Discovery Channel announced it was pulling the plug on its planned live coverage of Ogwyn's jump ""in light of the overwhelming tragedy"" and out of respect for the families of the dead. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the whole Sherpa community,"" the network said in a written statement. Ogwyn's father told CNN that his son was aware of Discovery's decision. Ogwyn, who has scaled Everest years ago, planned to hurl himself off the mountain in a wingsuit -- a flying squirrel-like outfit that allows skilled jumpers to glide long distances before deploying a parachute for a safe landing. He used one to fly past the mountain on a 2010 test flight. ""I'm hoping to be up there for a while and enjoy the flight,"" he told CNN in March. ""This will be a chance of a lifetime for me. I won't probably have it again."" Nepal's Sherpas have been guiding climbers up Everest for six decades. The avalanche occurred at the busiest time of year, when would-be climbers arrive to acclimate themselves to thin air of the Himalayas. Before Friday, the worst accident on Everest was in 1996, when eight climbers disappeared in a storm. It was documented in the book and film ""Into Thin Air."" Though hundreds of climbers now reach the summit each year, about 1% of those who attempt it die -- ""and as a workplace safety statistic, that's pretty much off the charts,"" Outside magazine Senior Editor Grayson Schaffer told CNN.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani flash floods have killed 110 people and left nearly 150 others injured in recent days, authorities said Saturday. The flooding, caused by monsoon rains, has also destroyed 650 homes, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's office said in a statement. The death and destruction has hit Pakistani-administered Kashmir, as well as Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province. Lahore and Rawalpindi, two major cities in Punjab, are experiencing serious urban flooding. Sharif will attend a meeting Saturday to review the ""situation in the country and damage caused to life and property by incessant rains and resulting floods,"" the statement said. The government reported Friday that up to a foot of rain (313 mm) had fallen in eastern parts of the country Thursday, causing heavy flooding. Some died from collapsing roofs or electrocution by downed power lines. Floods have also hit the Indian-administered part of Kashmir. Fifty people were killed when a bus carrying a wedding party overturned in a flash flood Thursday. They were among at least 70 killed in Jammu and Kashmir State as a result of flooding, Indian officials said. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","Flooding caused by monsoon rains has destroyed 650 homes, officials say .

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- Some protesters not satisfied with the Moroccan king's proposed constitutional reforms have called for a peaceful demonstration Sunday. ""The national coordinators (of the movement) have called for a demonstration Sunday for a truly democratic constitution and a parliamentary monarchy,"" a member of the Rabat wing said Saturday. ""The plan as proposed by the king yesterday, does not respond to our demands for a true separation of powers,"" he said Saturday. King Mohammed VI of Morocco declared sweeping reforms that will boost the power of the prime minister and take away some of his own. Morocco's revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable, the parliament in Rabat more dynamic and will give the government greater powers, the 47-year-old king said in a nationally televised address. A Casablanca-based spokeswoman for the reform movement said ""tomorrow there shouldn't be nationwide demonstrations as all Moroccans are happy with the king's speech."" The movement has called for the creation of a parliamentary monarchy, an end to the influence of the king's inner circle and for a crackdown on corrupt officials. Spain and Britain are examples of a parliamentary monarchy. In his 30-minute speech Friday, the sovereign described the draft constitution as ""a bedrock of the special Moroccan democratic development model -- a new historical bond between the throne and the people,"" while describing himself as a ""citizen king."" His actions followed a series of unprecedented protests not seen before in this North African modern Muslim country, where street protests are normally tolerated by the state, unlike in most other Arab countries. If the draft is ratified in a referendum set for July 1, its most radical change would be empowering voters to select a prime minister, thereby ending the longstanding practice in which the king has selected his own man for the job. The prime minister has tended to take his lead from the sovereign on key matters of state. If Moroccans back the draft, then the new prime minister would have new powers in decision-making and in day-to-day management -- relieving the king of a number of duties and aligning the style of management along the lines followed by some European Union countries. In an example of power sharing, the draft constitution empowers the prime minister to dissolve the House of Representatives, and stresses that the king shall consult him before announcing the dissolution of parliament. ""It specifies the conditions to be observed in each case in order to ensure the separation of powers as well as balance and cooperation between the branches,"" the king said. Friday's speech stems from a process that was first announced in March, after widespread civil unrest in the wake of the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. The king instructed a hand-picked committee to consult with political parties, trade unions and civil society groups on constitutional changes with a brief to trim the monarch's political powers and make the judiciary independent. But not all civil society groups were consulted, which sparked a wave of demonstrations across the kingdom from groups who feared they would be left out of the new plan. This move alone -- to grant real power to an elected prime minister -- could satisfy a number of demands from those members of society who have called for change. Confirming the full authority of the head of government over cabinet members, the draft constitution gives the prime minister the power to propose and dismiss cabinet members. But King Mohammed will remain a key power-broker in the security, military and religious fields, according to the draft. For example, the king would still serve as ""the supreme commander of the armed forces"" and would not relinquish the power to appoint ambassadors and diplomats under the new constitution. Furthermore, the king would retain the power to dissolve parliament after consultations with the new constitutional court, half of whose members he would have appointed.","Some protesters will gather Sunday; others oppose idea .

"(CNN) -- Last week, 19-year-old California university student Adeline Munguia was reported missing after she stopped responding to Snapchats and texts from her roommate. As it turns out, Munguia was fine -- she'd just turned off her phone for a while -- but the expectation of constant, instant communication was so normal in her social circles that taking a break was a shock to her friends. There's a growing movement that wants to make taking such a break from our electronics the rule, not the rare exception. Friday marks the start of the fifth annual National Day of Unplugging, an initiative launched by the national nonprofit group Reboot to help people take a break from their always-on lifestyles. Participants are encouraged to put away their phones, tablets, laptops and other Internet-connected doodads from sunset Friday to sundown Saturday for a digital sabbath. The time might instead be used for quiet reflection, communing with nature, reconnecting with family or friends, focusing on a project and even getting a rare, uninterrupted night's sleep. ""I think that people are overwhelmed. It's physically taken a toll on people,"" said Reboot's communications manager, Tanya Schevitz. ""If you think you have to respond to everything all the time, that's an unrealistic expectation."" Participants are encouraged to sign a pledge on the event's website and post a photo of themselves saying why they unplug. Some recent examples: . "" ... to focus on the faces in front of me."" "" ... to be open to the divine."" "" ... to connect."" The concept has caught on since the first unplugging day in 2010. Organizers have signed up more than 200 local and national groups as partners, including the Ad Council, Digital Detox and Google. Many will be hosting their own official events such as in-person gatherings and phone-free parties. Without the safety net of a smartphone, event-goers will probably work on dying social skills like maintaining eye contact, making small talk and communicating verbally in more than 140 characters. Although the official holiday lasts for just 24 hours, the idea is to create more awareness of how we interact with our devices and the impact this has on our work, family and mental health. Then people can take smaller steps to carve out device-free pockets of time during the day and eventually find a balance that works for them. ""Day to day, throughout your day, you should be thinking about unplugging moments,"" Schevitz said. Concern about our dependence on our electronic devices has grown in recent years as it's become increasingly difficult to step away from the online world. Phones beep and blink and beg for our attention with e-mail, text notifications, breaking news or updates from social media. Even when a phone is quiet, many of us still reflexively pick it up to check news and messages during moments of downtime. Researchers are still studying the impact that smartphones and mobile technology have on our lives. In the work sphere, there's increasing evidence that multitasking is inefficient. The brain can't fully focus on a task when it's constantly jumping around to do bite-size tasks like checking e-mail. At home, the divided attention can have a negative impact on relationships with children and partners. Schevitz recently heard stories about overly connected families firsthand when she spoke to a class of eighth-graders about unplugging. The students shared tales of their parents working at all hours or not listening because they were glued to their smartphones. It takes willpower to step away from technology. Schevitz has some tips for people interested in cutting down. 1. Replace the phone on your bedside table with an alarm clock. That way, you're not checking the device right before bed and first thing in the morning. The stimulation and even the light from the smartphone screen can disrupt sleep. 2. Set goals and schedule times when you think it would be beneficial to go sans phone. Make sure some of those times are when you're alone, not doing anything at all. People instinctively pick up their smartphones when there's a lull in a conversation or when they're waiting in line. Look around, observe people, be alone with yourself and think about what you might be missing in those moments. Psychologists have been researching something called attention-restoration theory. The idea is that people can better focus on tasks after taking a break to experience nature and giving part of their brains a rest. Something as simple as taking a walk or looking at photos of nature can reset people's attention spans and reduce stress. 3. Before you drop off the grid, be sure to give people a heads up. As the Munguia incident illustrates, going cold turkey can be jarring when your friends or bosses expect instant responses to their messages. Set boundaries -- like letting your workplace know you won't be checking e-mail after a certain hour -- and stick to them. The more people who participate, the less unusual it will seem, according to Schevitz. ""What we we need to do is reset society's expectations,"" she said.","National Day of Unplugging asks people to put away mobile devices for 24 hours .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in my case challenging the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, widely known as DOMA. I was honored and humbled by the opportunity to have my case considered by our nation's highest court. I have also been overwhelmed by the love and support I have received from people all across the country. To be honest, I never could have imagined that this day would come -- the day that I would be ""out"" as an 83-year-old lesbian suing the federal government. My late wife, Thea Spyer, was, and is, the love of my life. Although we couldn't live openly for much of our relationship, we became engaged in 1967 with a circular diamond brooch that symbolized the rings we weren't able to wear on our fingers. And we stayed engaged for the next 40 years, caring for each other, sharing all the joys and sorrows that came our way. Victory years after longtime partner's death . We lived through good times -- with jobs that we loved, great friends and a lot of dancing. But we also depended on each other for strength through the vicissitudes of aging and illness. In 1977, Thea was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis, which became debilitating over time. First, she had to use one cane, then two crutches, then a wheelchair. In Thea's last years, she was quadriplegic. We were lucky that the MS never affected her brilliant mind or her cognition, and that she was able to continue seeing patients as a psychologist until the day that she died. In 2007, we learned from Thea's doctors that she had only one year to live. When we realized that we were running out of time, we decided to marry in Canada. That marriage was recognized in our home state of New York. We wanted to be married for the same reason most people want to marry: to publicly and legally express our love and commitment to one another. When our wedding announcement ran in The New York Times, we heard from hundreds of people from every stage of our lives -- playmates and schoolmates, colleagues, friends and relatives -- pouring out love and congratulations because we were married. That's why marriage is different -- it's a magic word recognized by everyone as a demonstration of commitment and love. When my beautiful Thea died two years later, I was overcome with grief. Over the next month, I was hospitalized with a heart attack, and, in the midst of my grief, I realized that the federal government would not recognize our marriage. DOMA restricts federal marriage benefits and state-to-state recognition of marriages only to unions between a man and a woman. Because of DOMA, I was required to pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes that I would not have had to pay had I been married to a man instead of Thea. This was not only painful, it was wrong. I knew that Thea would want me to stand up for our marriage -- and for so many other gay couples and their families who are harmed by this unjust law. I believe that all marriages should be treated equally by the federal government in accordance with the Constitution. We won our case in two lower courts, and have now made it all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States -- which is a monumental feat in itself. I know that Thea's spirit was with us Wednesday at the oral argument. But our journey is not yet over. If, through my case, our story can help to ensure that the federal government treats all marriages equally, that will be the best possible final chapter in our love story. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edith Windsor.","Edith Windsor: I never thought I would be an 83-year-old ""out"" lesbian suing the government .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama sought to link the past and future on Monday in his second inaugural address, tying the nation's founding principles to the challenges confronting his second term in a call for Americans to fulfill the responsibility of citizenship. Eschewing poetic language for rhetorical power, Obama cited the accomplishments of the past four years while laying out a progressive agenda for the next four that would tackle thorny issues like gun control, climate change and immigration reform. ""We have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action,"" he said. ""My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment and we will seize it so long as we seize it together,"" he added later. Analysts called the speech politically astute and an important expression of new forcefulness by the president as he enters his second term following re-election last November. ""It's a real declaration of conscience, about principles, about what he believes in,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen. ""He basically said, 'When I came in the first term, we had all these emergencies, we had these wars. We've now started to clear the decks. Let's talk about what's essential.'"" Obama speech addresses social justice movements . The foundation of the address, and Obama's vision for the future, were the tenets he quoted from the Declaration of Independence -- ""that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" ""Today, we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time,"" Obama said to gathered dignitaries and flag-waving throngs on the National Mall. ""For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth."" In particularly pointed references, the president made a forceful call for gay rights that equated the issue with the struggle for women's rights in the 19th century and civil rights in the 1960s. ""We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall,"" Obama said, mentioning landmarks of the women's, black and gay rights movements. ""It is now our generation's task to carry on what those pioneers began,"" he continued, prompting the loudest applause and cheers of his address when he said ""our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts."" Opinion: 11 views on Obama's speech . More cheers came when Obama called for ""our gay brothers and sisters"" to be treated ""like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."" According to observers, it was the first time a president championed gay marriage in an inaugural address. With further mention of topical issues such as immigration reform and gun control, Obama came to his key point -- that adhering to America's bedrock principles requires taking action on today's challenges. ""Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness,"" he said. ""Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time -- but it does require us to act in our time."" A deep partisan divide in Washington and the country characterized Obama's first term, with Congress seemingly paralyzed at times and repeated episodes of brinksmanship over debt and spending issues bringing the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Acknowledging the political rift, Obama called for leaders and citizens to work for the greater good of the country. ""We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate,"" he said. ""We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect."" At the same time, he made clear he would fight for the central themes of his election campaign. ""For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,"" he said. While ""we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit,"" he said, ""we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future."" Text of speech . In particular, he defended the need for popular entitlement programs that provide government benefits to senior citizens, the poor and the disabled, saying they were part of the American fabric. ""The commitments we make to each other -- through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security -- these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us,"" Obama said. ""They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great."" On Monday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, one of Obama's harshest critics, called the president's second term ""a fresh start when it comes to dealing with the great challenges of our day; particularly, the transcendent challenge of unsustainable federal spending and debt."" Other issues also appear difficult, if not intractable. Obama made a reference to gun control, saying that the nation needed to ensure that ""all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for, and cherished, and always safe from harm."" However, congressional Republicans and some Democrats, as well as the powerful gun lobby, have rejected proposals Obama recently announced in response to the Connecticut school shootings that killed 20 Newtown first-graders last month. In citing climate change as a priority, Obama raised the profile of the issue on the national agenda after a presidential campaign in which it was almost never mentioned. ""We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,"" he said, warning of a ""long and sometimes difficult"" path to sustainable energy sources in a nation dominated by its fossil fuel industries such as oil and coal. ""America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it,"" Obama said. ""We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries -- we must claim its promise."" Obama infused his speech with references to two assassinated American icons -- President Abraham Lincoln and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. In one passage, Obama cited ""blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword"" in mentioning the Civil War and slavery. It mimicked Lincoln's second inaugural address in 1865, when he spoke of the possibility that ""every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn the sword."" Of King, Obama referred to those who came to Washington almost 50 years ago ""to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth."" The inauguration coincided with the national holiday honoring King. The president concluded by urging Americans to fulfill their responsibility as citizens by meeting ""the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals."" At a little more than 2,100 words, Obama's speech was about 300 shorter than his first inaugural address four years earlier. In 2009, he was fresh off his historic election as the nation's first African-American president, facing an economic recession, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the ongoing terrorist threat. David Maraniss, author of the book ""Barack Obama: The Story,"" said the difference from four years ago was palpable, adding: ""I could feel his heart beating this time.""

"(CNN) -- Japan is known the world over for its supreme train network. In the capital Tokyo, nearly half of all commuters travel by train, heavily outweighing other modes of transport like cycling, buses and private transport. Of the 48% of people who use the public rail network, 22% use the city's vast subway network. Sandra Barron is an American freelance writer who has lived in Tokyo for the last five years. Having spent the previous 10 years in New York, she is a seasoned subway rider. But nothing could have prepared her for the congested world of the Tokyo subway. Subway sandwich . ""The peak rush hour is really unbelievable. I've only been a few times and I've really made an effort to avoid it ever since because it is really crowded. It's like a cattle cart,"" Barron told CNN. ""It's just bodies squished as tightly as you can be into a small space. You can see people whose feet aren't touching the ground sometimes because they are wedged in so tightly,"" she laughs. Barron recalls a subway journey early into her stay in Tokyo. ""It was just streamed with people ... I basically couldn't get on the first couple trains with my bag. I finally got on and if you aren't paying attention and you are on the wrong side of the train, you might not be able to get out."" 'Pushy' staff . On both the rail and subway lines, train operators employ ""oshiya"" (or ""pushers""). Barron says: ""It's funny because ""pusher"" sounds really aggressive but they wear uniforms, white gloves and they have hats. It's like if you had a big laundry basket that overflows and you have to push the clothes down to close the lid. That's what they do. Infographic: The railway capital of the world . ""They make sure everybody gets in and doesn't get caught in the doors."" The subway line operators have also introduced women-only carriages to help women commute more safely through the city. The designated train cars are usually recognizable by signs in the carriage and on the platform and were brought in to combat ""chikan"" (""groping""). Subway snoozers . Another familiar sight on the Tokyo subway is sleeping commuters. ""A lot of people have a long commute -- an hour, two hours. Also, a lot of people stay out late drinking and they start early and have long hours at work,"" she says. ""There is a tolerance that if the person next to you falls asleep and their head kind of lands on your shoulder, people just put up with it. That happens a lot,"" she adds. ""People don't like it, they don't cuddle with them or anything but it's kind of accepted that that happens."" Watch: Car vs. Train race to Tokyo . The Tokyo subway ends its daily service between midnight and one o'clock, depending on the line. ""Oh God! You get a mad dash and all the conductors are platform attendants with megaphones reminding people: 'This is the last train, it is leaving now' ... It's literally like a wave of people running for the train,"" says Barron. For those unfortunate few that either miss their last train or fall asleep on the platform, there are a few options to pass the time before the first train begins in the early hours. ""They can stay at a capsule hotel, there are the manga cafes that are like internet cafes but you can stay the night in a little cubical,"" Barron says. ""People sometimes go to fast food restaurants and wait it out because things start running again about 4.30 in the morning."" When asked which subway network she prefers -- Tokyo or New York -- Barron can't quite decide. ""Compared to New York, [Tokyo] is really efficient, really orderly, really clean ... Gosh, it's like which of your children do you love more."" More: Japan rail quiz -- How will you fare? Barron's top tips for stress-free subway rides . 1. Buy a Suica card . A prepaid travel card that allows you to touch in and out at the stations. You can buy paper tickets but prepaid cards are easier and less time consuming. 2. Pay attention to your exit . Train stations can be huge terminals covering large areas of the local suburb with overwhelming crowds. Make sure you know where you are trying to get before you arrive at the station and keep an eye on the signs. 3. Follow the charts . Barron points out that each station has signs on the platform showing you which car you should ride depending on connecting lines. Use these to make your journey easier without missing your stop. 4. Be aware of your surroundings . Consider how people are acting and behave accordingly. Remember you don't have to be the noisy foreigner. 5. Use an app or website . Barron suggests Hyperdia or Jorudan as a good route finder.","24 million passengers use the Tokyo rail and subway network every day .

"Coober Pedy, Australia (CNN) -- Coober Pedy is one of the least accessible towns in Australia -- the place where the old American West meets Mars -- which is probably why it gained a reputation as the place where outlaws went to hide. Situated in the Outback, it is close to nothing: The cities of Adelaide and Alice Springs are respectively nine hours south and eight hours north, and the nearest town -- William Creek, official population three -- takes 3Â½ hours to reach, provided the dirt roads aren't closed due to rain. Here, the earth is red, vegetation bare and temperatures extreme, but none of that stopped Westerners from setting up camp a century ago when they found opal shimmering in the dirt. Lots of opal. So they began digging, in more ways than one. As they mined the earth to discover one of the world's richest gem deposits, they also discovered why Westerners didn't settle in this barren, desolate region of Australia before: The heat. To battle temperatures that regularly reached above 110, settlers dug underground dwellings, a practice that continues to this day. In the heat of day, people are nowhere to be found, each hidden in a mine or dugout. One sees why outlaws chose to come here: It's far from anything, it's desolate, it's pockmarked with underground homes, and it offers the possibility of a fresh start and the hope of a fortune. Walking down the town's main drag today makes one feel like a real-life space cowboy and evokes an episode of ""Firefly."" There's a reconstructed ""Star Wars"" spaceship, underground hotels, a Volkswagon beetle painted like an opal dangling from a store, signs for underground churches, a kangaroo orphanage, a couple of mining museums, underground home tours, and a pizza place that sells pies with toppings like kangaroo, emu sausage, sweet cranberry, asparagus, onions and Camembert. Its residents are known for being eccentric and hearty -- and if some are outlaws, they don't publicize it much on the street. What they do publicize is the town's international community, which represents more than 50 countries. There are olive groves for the Italians and Greeks, a Chinese restaurant so Asians can taste home and grocery stores with fare ranging from sweet chili sauce to imported Greek fondant and a whole kangaroo tail, complete with fur. All in a town of 1,900. Coober Pedy remains a popular tourist destination for those seeking an authentic Outback experience (or who want to see where films like ""Red Planet,"" ""Mad Max"" and ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" were filmed). Visitors often walk through the graveyard, where several tombstones are decorated with colored lights, and one even has, ""Have a drink on me,"" etched into it, with beer and wine bottles resting nearby, free of charge. They board a four-wheel drive mail truck for a 13-hour tour of Outback cattle stations and towns. And, of course, they sit on the hot, dusty earth, shooing away oddly persistent flies as they lose all sense of time searching for opal in the dirt, hoping that the next stone they turn might let them retire early. Outlaws came to Coober Pedy a century ago to find their fortune. Today, the town is an international community of residents united by their commitment to mining one of the world's most precious gems. Just as the town is home to the kind of diversity found in many cities, the opal that miners find so alluring, seductive, even, is a gem of many colors, with specks of pink, green, blue and red. It's a singular, unique, precious stone, and like Coober Pedy itself, what makes it so valuable is the rainbow inside. IF YOU GO . What to do . Outback Mail Run Tour: Guests travel 13 hours with an Australian mail carrier to deliver mail and supplies to five cattle stations (including the largest in Australia) and two towns (including one of the smallest in Australia). The tour provides a unique opportunity for visitors to experience the vastness of the Australian Outback and to learn about what it's really like to live there. Sunset, Ghosts and Stars Tour: Run by the Desert Cave Hotel, guests begin this tour by traveling 20 minutes outside town to the Breakaways, a geological formation of jagged hills marking what used to be the shorelines of an ancient ocean, to see the sunset. Once the stars have risen, guests travel back to the Old Cemetery in Coober Pedy, where a guide delights them with ghost stories of the town's most notable residents. Be sure to ask about Crocodile Harry! Old Timers Mine Museum: One of Coober Pedy's most popular destinations, the mine provides visitors with an opportunity to learn about the search for opal and the struggles of Coober Pedy's earliest miners. As part of the museum, guests have the chance to walk through an old-time dugout as well as a mineshaft. Fossicking: Tourists in Coober Pedy are welcome to dig for their own opal fortune at public fossicking sites in town. Simply sit on the red earth and look for shimmery rocks. Fossicking is free and guests usually find numerous low-quality opals. Ask any resident for directions to the nearest public fossicking site. Getting there . By plane: Regional Express operates a two-hour flight from Adelaide to Coober Pedy most days of the week. By train: The Ghan train operates a weekly service from Adelaide or Alice Springs to Manguri Station, 45 minutes outside Coober Pedy; transportation from the station must be arranged with hotels in advance, as there is no transportation at the station and trains from both cities arrive late at night. By bus: Greyhound offers daily service to Coober Pedy from both Adelaide and Alice Springs. Expect the trip from Adelaide to take 11 hours and the trip from Alice Springs to take eight. By car: Coober Pedy can be reached by car via a nine-hour drive from Adelaide or an eight-hour drive from Alice Springs. Drivers are warned not to drive through the Outback at night, because of the lack of gas stations and the threat of accidents caused by kangaroos; rain in the Outback may also render roads impassable, and drivers should not expect to have cell phone reception in the desert. Where to stay . Desert Cave Hotel: Located in the middle of Coober Pedy's main street, this is the town's only four-star hotel. Guests have the option to stay underground or aboveground. Underground rooms have ventilation but no windows. The Underground Motel: Offers underground accommodations to travelers with friendly hospitality. All rooms are underground with natural light and ventilation. Underground Bed and Breakfast: Owners Ana and Ken Male treat their guests to truly authentic Coober Pedy accommodation. Guests stay in underground rooms with a choice of en suite or shared bathrooms. Where to eat . John's Pizza Bar and Restaurant: Awards hang from the walls of John's, testifying to its reputation for having not only the finest pizza in Coober Pedy but some of the best in Australia. John's serves up not only traditional pies but also regional specialties like the Malu (smoked kangaroo, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, eggplant, marinated tomatoes, roasted peppers, eggplant and olives) and the Coat of Arms (sweet cranberry, mozzarella cheese, Camembert, emu metworst, spinach and smoked kangaroo). Pasta and sandwiches are also available. Tom and Mary's Greek Taverna: The place to go for Mediterranean food in the Outback. A favorite of locals and visitors alike, Tom and Mary impress visitors with authentic Greek fare. The restaurant is renowned for its seafood, especially the Saganaki prawns, so don't be afraid to try some fish in the desert. Also be sure to try some tzatziki -- the yogurt is made from scratch and the herbs are grown in the backyard. Then, with a full stomach, ask for directions to Coober Pedy's olive grove to continue that Greece-in-Australia experience. Hutchinson Street, Coober Pedy . Umberto's: Located in the Desert Cave Hotel, Umberto's is Coober Pedy's finest dining establishment, and is known for its Mod-Oz cuisine, including regional specialties like kangaroo, camel, emu and Australian beef. Italian food is also on the menu. The Pink Roadhouse (Oodnadatta): Situated in a largely aboriginal town of fewer than 300 people, this combo restaurant, grocery store and post office looms over the town in all its pink, hand-painted-sign splendor. The restaurant is known throughout Australia for its iconic Oodnaburger, which is composed of meat seasoned with secret spices, onion, cheese, egg, bacon, pineapple, lettuce, beetroot and tomato. The Outback Mail Run Tour stops here for lunch. William Creek Hotel (William Creek): Owned by two of the three permanent residents in South Australia's tiniest settlement, the William Creek Hotel serves a changing menu of fresh schnitzel, burgers and curries. The walls are covered with photos and business cards from folks who have passed through, and the owners always welcome friendly conversation and questions about what it's like to live in such rural territory. If visitors are too tired to move after eating, they can stay in one of the pub's hotel rooms. The Outback Mail Run Tour stops here for dinner.","Coober Pedy is a remote Australian opal-mining town .

"(CNN) -- The expensive casinos of Las Vegas look crowded. Tickets to the popular shows sell out. To the tourist, things look back to normal. Yet as the state's junior U.S. senator lamented in February, ""I can tell you right now Nevada is nowhere close to a normal economy."" Nevada's unemployment remains the second-highest in the nation, nearly 9%. The housing market there still languishes. New Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged to Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller that full recovery for Nevada glimmers ""years away."" Nevada's troubles are more than a local concern. They reveal something important about the condition of the whole U.S. economy. Nevada makes its living from tourism, the state's most important industry, and the tourists come -- or came -- for the casinos. Before 1990, the state of Nevada and Atlantic City, New Jersey, enjoyed something close to a monopoly on the casino industry. As more states legalized casinos, the Nevada casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. Dazzling theme hotels housed lavish theatrical shows and outstanding restaurants. Las Vegas, once a rather seedy place, repositioned itself as a center of glamorous entertainment. Building the new hotels generated jobs. The people who worked in the hotels needed places to live, and building those homes generated more jobs. All that construction shaped an unusual local economy: Here was a state with low average educational attainments (only about 22% of Nevadans have a college degree, 45th in the nation), yet a median income higher than the national average. Nevada's blue-collar prosperity was built on a faulty premise. All those glitzy Las Vegas hotels and resorts, containing typically up to 5,000 rooms each, depended on a huge influx of high-spending visitors. So long as homeowners could pay for vacations with some of the proceeds of their home refinancings, all was well. But when the refi boom stopped, Las Vegas suddenly discovered it had built a destination too expensive for its customer base. Everything else going on in the city -- the jobs in the hotels, the homes for the people who worked in the hotels, the malls where those people shopped, the homes for the people who worked in the malls -- all that crashed around Las Vegas' ears. And now, six years after the crash, it's hard to see a way forward from the disaster. Nationwide, the casino industry has more or less recovered from the recession. Americans left behind $37.34 billion in casinos in 2012, only a shade below the 2007 peak of $37.52 billion. But they are spending that money in casinos closer to home. Gross revenues of Nevada casinos languish 20% below their 2007 peaks. Because of the higher cost of Las Vegas-style amenities, a 20% drop in revenues translates into a 50% drop in profitability. So even as the industry nears recovery, the promise of a middle-class economy supported by gambling revenues has proven a mirage. Casino employment dropped in Nevada between 2012 and 2013. These were the best casino jobs in the country, which explains why total national casino wages lag 7% behind the 2007 peak even as industry revenues have nearly caught up to the 2007 level. Nor is there much likelihood of any early return to the old ways. Americans have grown cautious about gambling. While only about 14% of Americans express a consistent moral disapproval of gambling, according to industry surveys, there has been a sharp increase in the proportion who reject gambling for themselves personally: 27% in 2004, 38% today. Unsurprisingly, 2008 was the year of the biggest change of national mind on this subject. Meanwhile, those who do gamble are gambling in new ways that don't support the style of industry for which Las Vegas is famous. Younger gamblers are attracted to online forms of gambling, which create jobs only for computer programmers. Older gamblers increasingly prefer bare-bones casinos that offer free transportation and cheaper meals. Las Vegas' opulent palaces for the affluent gambler seem increasingly unsupportable in a country where more and more people have less and less disposable income. That's a social trend that should concern us all, however we feel about this particular pastime.","Nevada senator says his state is ""nowhere close to a normal economy""

"(CNN) -- One day, a rather inconsiderate caveman turned to his cavewoman and said, ""You know, Diane, you should really think about shaving your legs."" To which she replied, ""Shut up, Kevin. Get a job."" Having yet to successfully create fire or invent the wheel, caveman Kevin was, all in all, sort of a lousy cave-husband. And, quite frankly, Diane was tired of being told what to do by a naked man who spent most of his time playing Golden Tee in a cave with his friends. So she kept her legs just as they were. And nothing changed until around the 1940s. Which was a considerably long time. Caveman Kevin never got to see his dream come true. Though he did finally ace the par-three eighth at Coconut Beach. Obviously, there's no singular moment in history when Western women decided to start shaving their legs, but it was around the time of World War II when it sort of became a popular practice in America. And, consequently, it was about that same time when many Western men collectively decided that the presence of female leg hair was pretty much the worst thing in the entire world. Save for Nazis. But it was a close second. Of course, not every woman does it, not every woman should, and some women simply don't even need to. Nevertheless, the desire for smooth feminine legs spread throughout many places in the world. Which is why one particular hairy legged image went insanely viral this week after it was posted on the Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo. It wasn't just that these legs were cartoonishly covered in such a forest of grizzly scruff that Robin Williams' arms sent them a formal letter of surrender. It was the suggestion that these may have actually been hairy stockings for women, designed with the purpose of scaring away drooly men with lurking eyes. The Chinese trend-watching site ChinaSMACK translated the picture's caption as: Super sexy, summertime anti-pervert full-leg-of-hair stockings, essential for all young girls going out. Just like the other millions of people who saw this, I immediately searched all over the Web for any site where the stockings might be sold, and came up with nothing. Which was unfortunate, because, to the right buyer, they could make for a really funny bank robbery. ""Give me all the money!"" ""Tee hee. OK."" Of course, the real question is: Are they real? My gut (and all seven of my functioning brain cells) tells me no, but my heart wants to say yes. I simply need to believe that something this ridiculous might actually exist, for it confirms my longstanding suspicion that when it comes to good ideas, the world sort of topped out at the football phone. However, if you look closely at the image, the leg hair just seems far too natural to be synthetic. But, then again, there IS a fairly defined cutoff at the ankle, which suggests that maybe -- just maybe -- these are truly some form of leggings. I still don't think that's what they are, but, for the sake of argument, let's just assume we're dealing with an actual product. Thus, we have to ask: Who would buy them? Well, as the ChinaSMACK caption translation suggests, the supposed stockings are for any girl who wants to go out and not be bothered by ogling men. Or, perhaps, they're just for any girl who hopes to be courted by a gorilla. ""Hi, I'm Gary. Can I buy you a banana?"" Still, for those really wanting to avoid the low wandering eyes of dudes on the street, one has to wonder whether this is really a better solution than, say, pants. Or a dress. Or a one-piece black leather Catwoman suit. OK, maybe not that last one. Of course, many women simply don't want to fully cover up during the summer heat. Nevertheless, hairy leg stockings are still sort of an extreme measure. And, on top of that, you also dangerously risk attracting that super-creeper one who's very particular and absolutely lives for this sort of thing. That's probably the guy you want to avoid in the first place -- the hairy-leg-loving mouth breather who rides the bus all day. ""Mother said I'd meet a girl like you."" So, the online debate continues. Real or fake? Useful or not? Either way, the ghost of caveman Kevin is not impressed.","An image claiming to be ""hairy leg"" stockings appeared on a Chinese blog .

"Lushan, China (CNN) -- A strong earthquake that struck the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan this weekend has killed 186 people, sent nearly 8,200 to hospitals and created a dire dearth of drinking water, Chinese state-run Xinhua reported Sunday. Earlier reports had said as many as 11,200 people were injured. The Sichuan Red Cross estimated that drinking water in Ya'an City will run out within three days despite rescue workers' efforts to deliver supplies to quake-hit area. In more remote areas, where the shifting earth muddied river waters, people anxiously awaited evacuation, Xinhua said. Thousands of emergency workers, including soldiers, rushed to reach the affected zones in the hilly region, but their progress was impeded. Huge mountain chunks near the quake's epicenter in Lushan County have sheared off and fallen into valleys. Boulders have landed on roads, making emergency work difficult. Buildings were flattened in the county, and others had severe structural damage. Xu Mengjia, the Communist Party chief of Ya'an, the city that administers the area where the quake struck, told state broadcaster CCTV that because of landslides and disruption to communications, determining the total number of casualties will take some time. The Chinese government allocated 3 million yuan (about $480,400) to rescue and relief efforts Sunday, a day after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang traveled to the area from Beijing, state media reported. Li spent Saturday in Lushan County, leading the response near the quake's epicenter, then visited hospital patients Sunday, Xinhua reported. Students gather outside to escape the quake . The quake struck just after 8 a.m. local time Saturday, about 115 kilometers (71 miles) from the provincial capital, Chengdu, at a depth of around 12 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There was conflicting information about the earthquake's strength, with the USGS putting the magnitude at 6.6 and the China Earthquake Networks Center gauging it at 7.0. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, some of them as strong as magnitude 5.1, the USGS said. Authorities have sent rescue workers to the area around the epicenter, briefly halting flights at the airport in Chengdu and suspending high-speed rail operations, state media reported. The emergency response appeared to be substantial. Soldiers were seen heading into the area, while the government and Red Cross set up triage centers. The event stirred memories of the devastating earthquake that hit Sichuan in 2008, killing more than 87,000 people. First responders to Saturday's quake reported that the damage didn't appear to be as severe as what was seen after the 2008 disaster, according to CCTV. Fan Xiaodong, a student in Chengdu, said that when buildings began to shake in the city, many of his startled classmates rushed out of their dorms, some of them wearing only the clothes they'd been sleeping in. At first, Fan said, he only felt a slight trembling as he dozed in bed. ""I thought it was my roommates shaking the bed,"" he said. ""But the shock became stronger soon, and it came to me that an earthquake happened."" The epicenter was in Lushan County, a district of Ya'an. That area is home to China's famous giant pandas and houses the country's biggest panda research center. CCTV reported that the pandas at the facility, which is about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) from the epicenter, were safe. Residents of Chongqing, a sprawling metropolis more than 300 kilometers (about 190 miles) from Ya'an, said the quake also shook buildings there. Are you there? Send your iReports .

"(CNN) -- Scientists descended into a deep cave, hoping to find Ice Age mammals' remains. What they found stunned them: the remains of hundreds of big prehistoric mammals. The treasure trove was discovered in the Natural Trap Cave at the base of Bighorn Mountains in north-central Wyoming. ""We didn't know what to expect. We hadn't been there in 30 years and we didn't know what the cave would be like,"" Julie Meachen, a professor at Des Moines University, told CNN. She was among the scientists who rappelled down the 85-foot cave to excavate. Researchers believe these ancient animals may have fallen into what was then a sinkhole-like pit. Natural Trap Cave, part of land run by the on Bureau of Land Management, was discovered by an international team of paleontologists back in the 1970s. In past excavations, scientists have discovered the fossils of mammoths, short-faced bears, collared lemmings, and camels buried underneath layers of sediment. The cave is cool and damp -- prefect for preserving prehistoric remains, Meachen says. ""It's like a refrigerator in there,"" she said. ""Some of the bones we're finding there have collagen in them. That is where you could get the ancient DNA."" The scientists saw bones falling out of a part of the cave, and decided to start digging there. ""That was the fossil layer,"" she said. ""There is so much to dig. We have two more years for funding that we can be out there, so we are going to try to dig up as much as we can."" This year's excavation was funded by National Geographic. Professor Alan Cooper of Australia's University of Adelaide was also part of the excavation that began on July 29. The Bureau of Land Management in Wyoming tweeted a video of the professor discussing the fossil finds at Natural Trap Cave on Thursday, which was uploaded to Youtube. ""This is one of the richest sites for megafauna mammal bones in the lower 48 states and southern Canada,"" he said in the video. Megafauna mammals are considered to be large or giant animals, typically larger than a human. Some of the remains are believed to be of the North American lion and the American cheetah, Cooper explained in the video. Some of the species found are estimated to have gone extinct more than 20,000 years ago, according to the National Park Service. ""I've had this list of really puzzling evolutionary mysteries, things like the Falkland Islands wolf or the American cheetah, which we are finding bones of here, and the American lion,"" Copper said. Scientists are using latex gloves and breathing masks while surfacing the prehistoric remains as a way to ensure that excavators' DNA do not get onto the animal bones. Characteristics such as weight, smoothness of the surface and coloring can help scientists determine whether these prehistoric bones have genetic matter that they can test. The best preserved remains will be packed in cooler containers and transported back to universities in the United States and also the Australian Center of Ancient DNA and the University of Adelaide for testing. 8 places for fantastic fossil finds .

"(CNN) -- Somewhere in a Department of Homeland Security warehouse, thousands of doses of antiviral medications are about to expire. Another warehouse stores thousands of expired respirators. This is the equipment and medicine that was supposed to help protect government personnel in the event of a deadly pandemic. A federal investigation has found that the DHS is totally ""ill-prepared"" for something like the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic -- or something worse, such as a global Ebola outbreak or the 1918 flu pandemic that killed an estimated 21.5 million people, according to a report released by the Office of the Inspector General on Monday. In 2006, Congress gave DHS $47 million to prepare for such a national medical crisis. And the department did go shopping; it spent millions on this equipment that might now be completely worthless, missing or unnecessary. For example, the audit found more than 4,000 bottles of expired hand sanitizer in storage with the DHS. Many of those bottles have been expired for up to four years. Some 81% of the antiviral drugs the DHS has will expire by the end of next year. And 100% of the Tamiflu is set to expire in 2015. Some 46% of the Relenza DHS has will expire then as well. It was unclear to investigators whether the antiviral medication had been stored at a proper temperature. The department's entire respirator stockpile has reached, or will soon reach, the manufacturer's date of usability. And the report suggests the department failed to determine real-life needs before buying the equipment in the first place. The DHS Capital Region pandemic stockpile has about 350,000 white coverall suits, according to the report. Investigators say there is ""no justification or related documentation"" available to support that number of suits, nor does any kind of documentation explain why they were necessary. The same is true for surgical masks. There are 16 million in the department's inventory; no reason was given for having that many. Overall, DHS failed to keep good records about what it purchased and what it received, according to the report. That may be why the government had to report a secondary stockpile containing 25,000 surgical masks and hand sanitizer as ""lost."" The report concluded ""it is imperative that DHS be prepared to continue mission-essential operations should a pandemic occur,"" and yet it found that DHS didn't develop a clear plan on how to replenish their stockpiles of equipment. Nor did they have a good way to keep a good control over their inventory to monitor expiration dates on material. ""DHS is responsible for ensuring it is adequately prepared to continue critical operations in the event of a pandemic,"" Inspector General John Roth said in a news release. DHS agreed with all 11 suggestions the Inspector General's Office made to improve the program. The department will assign an office to oversee the supplies and develop an adequate strategy for making sure the material stays current. It has applied for a shelf life extension with the Food and Drug Administration to extend the expiration dates on the antiviral medicine it has that will expire in 2015. ""We will work with them to see that this vital program is strengthened,"" Roth said.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- It took the tragedy of Reeva's Steenkamp's death for the media, for South Africa, to realize just how brightly Oscar Pistorius' star had ascended after the London Olympics when he ran against able-bodied athletes. Shock over the shooting reverberated across the world, not just at home. His story had touched people -- it was the classic tale of triumph over adversity, of hope and determination. And then it was all over. The fallout was immediate, furious and personal. South Africans seemed to have a deep emotional attachment to Oscar Pistorius the hero and then, inevitably, his fall from grace. The interest in the case and the court case has never really subsided, every twist and turn has been analyzed and debated and there is still an insatiable appetite for the story. I first met Oscar Pistorius in 2008 at his home, in the bedroom that was to become a crime scene five years later. He was young, enthusiastic and eager. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he showed our camera his different prosthetics and his stumps, explaining patiently about his birth defect and where his legs had been amputated as a child. He seemed determined, somewhat naÃ¯ve and enthusiastic about his future. By Valentine's Day last year he was a different person. He walked into the magistrate's court days after he shot his girlfriend and looked like a blank, broken man. The implications of his actions -- whether it was intentional or negligent or neither -- were etched on his face. His future plans and the life that of the woman he said he loved were over. The vomiting, the crying and the sobbing in court seemed genuine, I didn't think he was 'faking it' as the state and critics suggested. No matter whether he's judged innocent or guilty it was clear Pistorius' emotions were raw, remorseful. He still treasures photographs of Reeva and him together, his uncle Arnold told us in an interview at the home where Oscar is living. The vomiting and retching were a physical manifestation of the gut-wrenching reality of his actions. Later, psychiatrists said it was a result of post-traumatic stress disorder . Throughout the court drama and the media focus on Oscar Pistorius, Reeva's Steenkamp's mother, June, sat a few meters from him -- still, stony-faced and stoic. I don't know how she managed to compose herself, especially on the days in court when Pistorius described the night her daughter died and then, shockingly, the day the state showed the court images of her dead daughter's bloodied head. Brave, strong woman. On Thursday, Judge Thokozile Masipa is set to deliver her verdict in the case, with possibilities ranging from a life sentence to Pistorius -- nicknamed the ""Blade Runner"" for the prosthetic devices on his legs -- leaving court a free man. For all the families involved, this has been a tragedy played out in the glare of cameras and intense public interest. For our CNN team covering the story since February 14, 2013, it's been important for us not have to have taken sides, or to reduce Reeva's death and Oscar's actions to a tawdry soap opera. Instead, we've tried to instead reflect public sentiment and to let the justice system and the legal process wind its way to a conclusion.

"(Mashable)  -- Some folks at the Hacker publication 2600 decided to compile a list of words that are restricted by Google Instant. Except in extreme and special cases, Google is known for anything but censorship, but as we've said before, there are some terms the web giant's new instant search feature won't work with. We understand Google's intentions; the team over there is trying to make sure that no one sees pornographic or violent results they might fight disturbing unless they really mean to search for them. When asked about this feature a few weeks ago, Google's Johanna Wright said the restrictions are in place to protect children. But Google has opened itself up to a potential PR problem, because some of these omissions will be at best bewildering and at worst offensive to particularly sensitive (or progressive) users who don't understand how Google Instant actually works. For example, ""bisexual"" and ""lesbian"" are among the restricted words. Type them in to Google and the instant search will immediately stop delivering new results. You have to hit enter to confirm, yes, you really do want to know about something in some way related to bisexuals or lesbians. Why did Google block these words? You can still search for these terms. The issue is that when you type them, Google Instant stops reporting results on the fly, and you must hit ""enter"" to see results. That happens because Google Instant doesn't just use what you've typed to display results. It reads data collected over the years about previous users' searches to predict what you're going to type. It's the same algorithm that handles auto-complete, or the Google Suggest pop-ups in the old, not-so-instant Google search. Google searches only display for the exact text that you've typed after you've hit enter. When results fail to appear after you've typed ""lesbian"" or ""butt,"" it's not because the results are being censored. Google is struggling to prevent the text of offensive searches users have made in the past (there have been other controversies on this subject before) from jumping up in front of you when you're looking for something innocuous. Since countless users may have followed the word lesbian with ""porn,"" generating results inappropriate for children, Google's algorithm has decided not to immediately throw 20 links to lesbian porn sites in your face when you type ""lesbian,"" even if that's the most common search based on the algorithmic data. When we contacted Google for comment, we received this statement from a spokesperson: . ""There are a number of reasons you may not be seeing search queries for a particular topic. Among other things, we apply a narrow set of removal policies for pornography, violence, and hate speech. It's important to note that removing queries from Autocomplete is a hard problem, and not as simple as blacklisting particular terms and phrases. In search, we get more than one billion searches each day. Because of this, we take an algorithmic approach to removals, and just like our search algorithms, these are imperfect. We will continue to work to improve our approach to removals in Autocomplete, and are listening carefully to feedback from our users. Our algorithms look not only at specific words, but compound queries based on those words, and across all languages. So, for example, if there's a bad word in Russian, we may remove a compound word including the transliteration of the Russian word into English. We also look at the search results themselves for given queries. So, for example, if the results for a particular query seem pornographic, our algorithms may remove that query from Autocomplete, even if the query itself wouldn't otherwise violate our policies. This system is neither perfect nor instantaneous, and we will continue to work to make it better."" Google's highly effective SafeSearch algorithm still applies to instant search results. SafeSearch can filter out potentially offensive search results quite effectively after a user has hit ""enter"" -- the first page of results for ""lesbian"" with moderate safe search enabled is completely innocuous -- and it works for searches in progress too. Google's current implementation is far from perfect -- the company rep admitted that. If nothing else, we'd like to see Google manually re-enter safe suggestions for some common terms that have been restricted because they're sometimes connected with sexual, violent or hateful results. The rep told us that Google is working on improving the system, but wouldn't give us any specifics about future changes. In the meantime, check out the complete list at 2600 if you're curious. © 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","There are some terms Google's new instant search feature won't work with .

"(CNN) -- Legend has it the first machine dispensed holy water in exchange for a coin in ancient Egypt. Tobacco vending machines have been around since the 1600s. Then came soft drinks, chocolate bars, bubble gum and condoms. Now, vending machines can be used for anything small enough to be lifted out of a tray, it seems. Japan has embraced the concept wholeheartedly, selling eggs, bras, live lobsters, salad, cold and hot coffee, ties and, reportedly, even used underwear from machines. Other countries are catching on. 1. Cupcakes (New York) In the land where ""small cakes baked in cups"" were first mentioned in a recipe book in the 1700s, it's not surprising the hand-held cake has gone 24/7. Stocked with up to 750 cupcakes baked daily in the adjoining Sprinkles bakery, this sugar-pink vending machine sells cupcakes around the clock. For $4.25 you get to choose from cinnamon chocolate, black and white and seasonal specialties such as Irish chocolate and maple bacon. There's even a doggie cupcake for your pooch, giving you an excuse to stop by when on ""walkies."" Sprinkles opened its first ""cupcake ATM"" in California in 2012 and has also installed the machines in Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas. Where to find it: 780 Lexington Ave., New York . 2. Gold bars (Dubai, UAE) You might not often need to buy a gold bar in the middle of the night, but in the United Arab Emirates, the tradition of gifting gold on holidays, festivals and special occasions is still going strong. At the Gold ATM you can purchase anything from a 2.5-gram, 24-karat gold coin to a rather more substantial 31-gram (one ounce) gold bar. You even have a choice of designs: a locally significant Burj Khalifa design or a kangaroo or Canadian maple leaf. The price stays up to date via the Internet, it's refreshed every 60 seconds. Where to find it: Lower Ground Floor, next to entrance to Burj Khalifa Observation Deck At The Top, Dubai Mall, Down Town, Dubai, UAE . 3. Flip-flops (Sydney) Flip-flops, or thongs as they're locally known, are part of the uniform in this country of sunshine, surfer dudes and an all-embracing relaxed attitude. If you've arrived unprepared, the Havaianas flip-flop vending machine in Sydney's city center could be your sole salvation. You're at the mercy of the machine for sizes and styles, but for $20 you're good to kick off your city shoes and hop to the beach. Where to find it: Ground level, The Galleries, 500 George St., Sydney, NSW, Australia . 4. Umbrellas (Vancouver, British Columbia) You know that you've landed somewhere with inclement weather when there's an umbrella vending machine at the airport. One of the wettest cities in Canada with an average of 57 inches of rain per year, Vancouver prides itself in its mild climate, but gives you the option to be prepared. For $5 you get a pocket-sized umbrella and ... well that's it. Where to find it: Level 1, domestic arrivals just before the exit to public transportation, Vancouver Airport, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada . 5. Bicycle helmets (Melbourne, Australia) People clad in Lycra populate Aussie roads, but they stay safe -- it's illegal in Australia to ride a bike without a helmet. If you've just arrived and want to cycle around the sights, you can pop into one of the many 7-Elevens in town to get a brain bucket. If you're alighting at Southern Cross Station in the heart of Melbourne, however, you can get one out of a machine. Three sizes, one design, $5, and you have a stylish blue helmet that's safe and legal. Where to find it: Southern Cross Station, near the rental bike stand on Spencer Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia . 6. Caviar (Los Angeles) Caviar and vending machines? Beverly Hills, stronghold of the obscenely well-to-do, is home to not one but three caviar vending machines. Called Caviar Automated Boutiques, these upscale vendors offer more than a dozen types of caviar from all over the world, packed in shiny containers offering anything from a tasty morsel at 25 grams (around $25) to party boxes of 400 grams ($999.95). Where to find it: Westfield Topanga, Level 2, 6600 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Canoga Park, California . 7. Books (Canada) It's a universally acknowledged truth that those in possession of too many unread books continue to buy new ones. Green Reads offers a solution: a book vending machine that allows you to get a good secondhand book for $2, as well as giving you the opportunity to donate a book for the next reader. The machines are located in commuter-dense areas such as train stations, hospitals and airports. A portion of proceeds earned by the machines are donated to female literacy and numeracy programs in Africa. Where to find it: The prototype is at Barrie Transit Downtown terminal, 24 Maple Ave., Barrie, Ontario . 8. Burritos (Los Angeles) Students' diets are notoriously bad, so what better place than the University of Southern California campus for the first-ever burrito vending machine? For $3.75 you can get a hot, steaming burrito. So that busy students don't get too bored while being idle for the 90 seconds it takes to dispense, they can watch a music video while the robotic machine puts their food together. Where to find it?

"(EW.com) -- Last weekend, the ensemble relationship comedy ""Think Like a Man"" opened to an astonishing $33.6 million, exceeding practically everyone's expectations, including those of one of the film's standout stars, actor-comedian Kevin Hart. ""I knew the movie was going to do well because it was tracking well,"" he tells EW, ""but we were thinking in the range of $20-25 [million]. When in came in the 30s, that was a little mind-blowing. For me that just shows the power of social media."" No kidding. Hart has practically built his entire career harnessing the power of his Twitter feed and Facebook page to drive audiences to his films. Last September, his stand-up comedy feature ""Laugh at My Pain"" opened to $2 million on just 97 screens, a feat he largely credited to his social media fan base spreading word and supporting the film. For ""Think Like a Man,"" Hart notes that, combined, the entire cast boasts well over 20 million Twitter followers. ""So we got together and just did a blitz ourselves....When you're doing movie promos and there's billboards and stuff, yeah it's out there, and you know people see it. But we were getting direct responses because of Twitter and Facebook. It was unbelievable."" Of course, a movie's number one debut is not built on tweets alone. Hart credits three other DIY efforts for helping catapult his film to the top of the box office: . Multitasking! As part of his stand-up comedy tour, Hart started screening the trailer for ""Think Like a Man"" at the beginning and ending of every set. ""Because I was doing arenas, I was [performing] for 15-to-20,000 people a night. I was reaching anywhere from 60-to-90,000 people through the course of a week."" Making a scene! Earlier this year, Hart created a media kerfuffle when he got himself ejected from the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game -- and then was still named MVP. ""Yeah, first celebrity to ever get ejected from a celebrity game,"" says Hart with a hearty chuckle. He swears his outburst wasn't premeditated -- ""I literally was having a good time and being myself"" -- but he's not ashamed at taking advantage of the situation either. ""All press is good press,"" he says. ""All the attention it got, it became 'Kevin Hart from ""Think Like a Man""...' -- not just 'Kevin Hart.' And the story just got bigger."" Giving away free popcorn! ""I love to pop up at the movie theaters,"" says Hart. ""I love to treat the people who are there. 'Guys, whoever meets me at the 3 p.m. showing at ""The Grove""' -- or wherever city I'm at -- 'popcorn and soda on me.' Literally just showing your fans your appreciation. I wouldn't be where I am now if it wasn't for their support. So I'm not the type of person who can turn my back on that support. I try to do little things to show that I'm not only appreciative of it, but I don't take it for granted. I'm humbled by it. It's amazing to me."" Chances are very likely, meanwhile, that Hart will have another film of his hit number one at the box office this weekend: the romantic comedy ""The Five-Year Engagement."" He's already planning his social media blasting for the week; he calls his Twitter and Facebook sites ""my permanent radio station"" for their promotional power. But they also provide him an invaluable way to connect with his fans. ""I make sure that my fans realize that they can talk to me,"" he says. ""I'm here. I'm reachable. I think sometimes celebrities get so big they're not reachable. When you're not in a place where people feel like they know you or can contact you or can talk to you, it's harder for them to support you. People want to act like they know celebrities. They want to see pictures. They want to know where you're going. They want to hear you talk about your family. They want to hear you b**** and complain about problems. They want to know that you're human. People [in the entertainment industry] who don't realize that are people who will be left behind. They're not realizing the day and time we're living in.

"(CNN) -- Another American doctor infected with the deadly Ebola virus is coming home for treatment in the United States. Dr. Rick Sacra was stationed in Liberia when he was exposed to the virus. He will be flown to Nebraska, according to the international Christian mission organization Serving In Mission. He's expected to arrive at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha on Friday. His spouse, Debbie Sacra, said he is ""clearly sick"" but is in ""good spirits"" and was able to walk onto the plane. ""We are really encouraged by that news and are looking forward to reuniting with him,"" she said. Sacra was admitted to an Ebola case management center over the weekend near the hospital in Monrovia where he has served for 15 years. ""Rick was receiving excellent care from our SIM/ELWA staff in Liberia at our Ebola 2 Care Center,"" said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA. ""They all love and admire him deeply. However, The Nebraska Medical Center provides advanced monitoring equipment and wider availability of treatment options."" What to know about the killer disease . Sacra, who is from Holden, Massachusetts, was not treating Ebola patients directly. Instead he was delivering babies at a general hospital in Monrovia, Johnson said. ""I am surrounded by friends and family and the body of Christ, who are a great encouragement and who are praying fervently for Rick's recovery along with me,"" Debbie Sacra said in a statement. ""We are trusting in God to be with Rick and us through this difficult circumstance. ""Rick would want me to urge you to remember that there are many people in Liberia who are suffering in this epidemic and others who are not receiving standard health care because clinics and hospitals have been forced to close. West Africa is on the verge of a humanitarian crisis, and the world needs to respond compassionately and generously."" Sacra had been to Liberia with SIM before, and volunteered to go again after he heard fellow missionaries Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly had contracted the virus, SIM President Bruce Johnson said. Both were also flown to Atlanta for treatment and have been released. ""We learned a bit from (the) Emory experience,"" Dr. Philip Smith, with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said about where Brantly and Writebol were treated. ""They found that after they took care of these patients for a little while that they were comfortable backing down ... Even though it's backing down, it's still two or three layers of gloves instead of one. It's no comparison to what you would do in an ordinary hospital floor,"" he said, CNN affiliate KETV reported. Human trial of experimental Ebola vaccine begins . Sacra started to show symptoms of haemorrhagic fever on Friday evening. Health care workers did an Ebola test on Monday, which came back positive for the deadly virus. Sacra was following all protocols and taking all necessary precautions against Ebola, Johnson said.

"Frederick, Maryland (CNN) -- In front of a mirror, Aesha Mohammadzai sees what is possible. There, in the center of her face, is a nearly complete piece of herself -- a piece she's been missing since the day she was mutilated nearly four years ago. Since August 2010, when her image appeared on the cover of Time magazine, she's been known for what she didn't have. Her Taliban husband and in-laws hacked off her nose and ears as punishment for running away. Her disfigured face became a symbol for oppressed women in Afghanistan, a reminder of what might come in spades if the Taliban regains control. Today, she is only minor surgeries away from having the new nose she's longed for. The grueling procedures -- involving a painful skin expander in her forehead, as well as skin, bone and cartilage grafts -- are behind her. Come this summer, for the first time in years, she will appear whole. But rebuilding a nose and rebuilding a life are two very different propositions. The first involves her being at the mercy of others; the second demands that Aesha, 22, do the work. With the end of her face's transformation in sight, she and the Afghan family that's embraced her believe everything else -- an education, a career, independence -- will be possible. ""She's a very bright girl. And her future is actually in her hands, you know. But we are the instrument to coach her. ... This should be our duty, to show her the right way and the wrong way,"" says Mati Arsala, who serves as her father figure and is facing his own challenges today. ""There is no limitation for her -- where she can go."" CNN has been following Aesha's journey in America since January 2011, a year before we were even able to speak directly to Aesha -- let alone take photographs or shoot video. In our initial exclusive piece, we explored her winding, complicated search to find a place to call home. Her journey began with a few months in California, where she was supposed to get reconstructive surgery but was deemed too emotionally unstable to handle it. She then went to New York, where she stayed for a year under the care of the nonprofit Women for Afghan Women. There she made progress, with the help of tutors, English classes and therapy. But the support network in New York couldn't give her something she'd eventually claim for herself. Aesha wanted a family. And after meeting Mati, his wife Jamila Rasouli-Arsala and their daughter from Jamila's first marriage, Aesha campaigned to join them through months of middle-of-the-night phone calls. Knowing what she'd been through, and believing they could give her something no one else could, they opened their doors. In late November 2012, she moved into their Fredrick, Maryland, home. ""I suffered a lot in my life,"" Aesha said, as Jamila translated, days before her first surgery last June. ""Now I feel that a light comes into my life."" Her surrogate parents, though, are now swimming in their own sea of worries. Days before Christmas, Mati lost his engineering job with Bechtel, one he'd had for nearly 30 years. And Jamila, who'd been an OBGYN in Germany before moving to the U.S. to join Mati, has struggled to find her way professionally. She needs to complete a residency program to practice medicine here, but so far has been unable to secure a spot in a program. Jamila has spent the better part of the last year in New York, away from her family, working at a Brooklyn hospital as a house physician -- a low-paying and demanding position open to doctors in her situation -- in hopes it would help her land a residency this spring. But for the third year in a row, she came up empty-handed. Their flexibility as a family, their ability to pick up as a unit and move for work, is limited in part by Aesha's surgeries. She's being treated for free at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Once her nose is completed in the coming months, doctors will move onto her ears -- a less-cumbersome reconstructive process, but one that will take time. Her disfigured ears, though, have not haunted her like her nose. Her dark hair, which flows down to her waist, covers them. Aesha's transformed face, and her sense of peace and comfort in her new Maryland home, is a testament to her development. But as she progresses physically and emotionally, in other respects Aesha's life is on hold -- teetering between inertia and, at times, regression. She's been living in a protective bubble ever since her surgical process began 11 months ago. She's floated between surgeries and, for the most part, not been engaged with the outside world. She, and those caring for her, say she can't risk contracting a cold or, worse, an infection. As a result, she's stopped going to her weekly English classes and barely speaks English anymore. She stays up all night watching Bollywood videos and making jewelry. She sleeps during the day. Mati and Jamila want to give her space to heal. Now is not the time to push her, they say. Soon enough, when her nose is complete, she'll have no choice but to move forward. But what will those next steps look like? What will her future hold? No mirror can reflect to Aesha, or anyone else, those answers. If you are interested in making a donation to Aesha's personal account to support her on her journey, go to the website set up in June 2012 by the family who is caring for her: Aesha's Journey.","Her Taliban husband and in-laws cut off her nose and ears as punishment for running away .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ten years ago this week, under orders from Gen. Eric Shinseki, then Army Chief of Staff, the black beret became standard gear in the U.S. Army. It was the start of a pitched battle within the Army that would soon find itself fighting two hot wars. Now, just shy of the anniversary, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the current Army chief of staff, has replaced the black beret with the patrol cap as the default headgear for soldiers wearing Army combat uniforms, what most of us would call their camouflage fatigues. A patrol cap is like a camouflage baseball cap with a flat top rather than a rounded crown (think Pittsburgh Pirates circa 1979.) ""It's fantastic,"" one soldier at the Pentagon said when CNN asked about the change. ""Awesome,"" wrote a soldier on the Army's official Facebook page. ""Sanity has prevailed."" For years, soldiers have complained the wool beret was hot, hard to adjust and took two hands to put on. Others said it looked out of place in combination with the uniform soldiers wore when doing their grubbiest work. But even before Shinseki's order, the idea of having the entire Army wear berets was met with anger by the soldiers already wearing berets, like Special Forces, Airborne troops and especially the Army Rangers. Special Forces, known better as the Green Berets, considered the beret as a symbol of their becoming members of an elite group of soldiers. As did Airborne troops with their maroon berets and the Rangers who had been wearing black berets since at least 1979. Many of these elite soldiers felt that having every soldier wear a beret diminished the work and training they'd gone through to earn their berets. ""Originally the black beret was a Ranger tradition,"" said Butch Nery, president of the U.S. Army Ranger Association. ""Now I've gotten used to the tan beret."" ""My initial reaction to the decision to make the black beret the official headgear of the Army was one of anger and disappointment,"" Retired Army Major Richard Jones wrote in an official Army Internet post about the beret. At first, he tried to have the decision reversed before eventually getting on board. This latest change means the Special Forces and Airborne troops will keep their green and maroon berets, and the Rangers will stick with the tan berets that they switched to 10 years ago. If it strikes you that the Army is spending a lot of time and money worrying about hats, well not so. First off, the Army doesn't wear hats, it wears headgear or covers. More importantly, the Army says this move will soon save taxpayers about $6.5 million. The savings will come because most soldiers were being issued two berets and two patrol caps. Now they'll be issued just one beret and two patrol caps. The beret won't go away; it will still be the standard head gear for soldiers wearing their Army Service Uniform (ASU), a dress uniform for more formal events. Even some of those who opposed wearing the beret in the field posted on Facebook that they liked keeping the beret for those occasions. ""Glad you're still holding onto the beret for certain things, looks great with the ASU!"" one soldier posted.","The Army's black beret is being replaced with the patrol cap .
""Sanity has prevailed,"" says one soldier .
Some soldiers say the beret is hot, hard to adjust and takes two hands to put on ."
"(CNN) -- The NFL referees union formally ratified Saturday a contract with the league that had been agreed upon earlier this week. The approval marks an official end to the lockout, said spokesman Greg Aiello of the National Football League. Even before the formal vote, the officials returned to work in Thursday night's game in Baltimore between the Ravens and the Cleveland Browns. The Ravens won, 23-16. The new eight-year contract -- the longest ever for officials, according to the NFL -- gives the union referees a pay bump from $149,000 a year in 2011 to $173,000 in 2013. The pay will rise to $205,000 by 2019. Real refs return to cheers . The agreement keeps their pension program in place for five years. The contract allows the NFL to hire some officials on a year-round basis and hire additional referees so they can be trained. This season's use of replacement referees climaxed in a furor over a botched call that allowed the Seattle Seahawks to walk away with a 14-12 victory against the Green Bay Packers in a nationally televised game Monday night. In what became a widely mocked symbol of the quality of officiating by the replacements, a photo from that game shows two officials in the end zone displaying competing signals: one indicating a touchdown, the other an interception. The result generated intense and immediate criticism of the league. Even President Barack Obama weighed in Tuesday urging a quick resolution. On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was ""very pleased"" with the preliminary resolution. For NFL officials, it's a side job that requires a lot of work . Commissioner Roger Goodell said he was not surprised by the outcry about the Monday night game. The league acknowledged Tuesday that the Packers should have won, but allowed the result of the game to stand. The return of the league's regular referees won't put an end to controversial calls, said retired NFL player Tiki Barber. But it will raise the respect level between coaches and players and officials, Barber said. ""There's still going to be arguing with referees,"" he said. ""They're still going to make bad calls. But now we're going to know that it's coming from a base of knowledge. These guys know what they're talking about and they're going to have an argument for why they do what they do on the field."" Lessons for NFL fans . CNN's Jason Durand and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","NFL referees already returned to work in Thursday night's game .
Saturday's ratification was a formality, establishing an eight-year contract, the longest ever .
Union refs' salary will rise: $149k in 2001 to $173k in 2013, topping out at $205k by 2019 .
The league will be allowed to hire additional referees so that they can be trained ."
"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama said recently that ""we don't have a strategy yet"" to defeat the Islamic State -- also known as ISIS or ISIL -- many people were scandalized. Columnists attacked him for what they said was his admission of a deep failure. His own staff had to run around defending and explaining what he said. It was seen as a terrible blunder. Maybe it was. Or maybe it wasn't. The truth is that 13 years after the September 11 attacks, the United States does not have an effective strategy for dealing with radical Islamists and their deep commitment to waging war against us and against our civilization. Much like the man who has a hammer and therefore assumes every problem is a nail, our bureaucracies have tried for 13 years to redefine the problem into something they are comfortable dealing with. Two long, bitter wars -- Afghanistan is now the longest war in American history, four years longer than the American Revolution and almost three times the length of American participation in World War II -- have not made America and its allies safer. The emergence of the Islamic State, as the terror group calls itself, is a further reminder that the analysis and predictions of the intelligence community, the military and the State Department have often been just plain wrong. Islamic State controls vast regions in two countries and has substantial military equipment. It is not just a new problem in nation-state relations. Whether to engage it inside Iraq or Syria is not the key question. Instead, the most important aspect about Islamic State is that it is a vector for attracting, training and preparing foreign terrorists from all over the world. Islamic State comprises 10,000 potential terrorists from more than 50 countries. Estimates vary widely on how many Americans have gone Syria to join ISIS and other extremist groups. Some officials say dozens have gone; House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says ""hundreds."" At least one of them, from Minneapolis, was recently killed. Why it took Obama so long to address his no ISIS strategy comments . More than 500 potential terrorists are believed to have traveled from Great Britain to join ISIS. It's believed that the two American journalists were beheaded by the same man, and experts believe he is from England. British Prime Minister David Cameron has begun to recognize the depth and power of the terrorism crisis. He is proposing a series of major legal changes in Britain to eliminate would-be terrorists from British life. There will be even more draconian laws proposed in the near future if this conflict escalates. We are facing a new kind of crisis in the rise of radical Islamists who spread their ideology worldwide through the Internet and through human networking. It is a global phenomenon and the analytical models and strategic patterns that have worked with nation-states will simply fail when applied to the Islamic State and its fellow terrorists in Hamas, Boko Haram, Libyan militants, Yemeni jihadis or any other group. We need a new analysis with new language and new strategies that relate to defeating a viral system that spreads across national boundaries. We're better off with a president who doesn't have a good strategy and knows he doesn't than with a president who has a bad strategy but thinks he has a good one. For most of his administration, the president was firmly in the latter category, so his recent epiphany marks an improvement. If there is a silver lining in President Obama's disastrous foreign policy, it has been in awakening Americans and perhaps even the President himself to the need for a profound rethinking of our approach to radical Islamism.","Critics pounced when President Obama said ""we don't have a strategy yet"" to defeat ISIS .
Newt Gingrich: But it's true -- 13 years after 9/11, we don't have strategy for defeating extremists .
Gingrich: We need a new strategy toward a whole new breed of extremists .
He says it's better if you have no good strategy and know it than to implement a bad one ."
"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich will enjoy home advantage when they play Chelsea in the European Champions League final after defeating Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu following Wednesday's dramatic penalty shootout. Bastian Schweinsteiger struck the winning penalty kick after nine-time champions Madrid won the second leg semifinal 2-1, leveling the tie 3-3 on aggregate, and forcing the match into extra time. After a goalless 30 minutes, the match went to penalties. Bayern won the shootout 3-1 and booked their place in a final that is to be hosted at the German club's Allianz Arena stadium on May 19, where home fans will be hoping for a fifth European crown and first since 2001. ""That was a magical night,"" said Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes, who in 1998 led Real to the European title for the first time in 32 years before being sacked after only one season in charge. ""We were in real trouble in the first 15 minutes, but after that we played outstanding football for long periods. I'm specially delighted for my players and the club management."" Madrid started in explosive fashion, dominating the opening exchanges, and quickly won a controversial penalty when Bayern defender David Alaba was adjudged to have handled the ball even though it had been blasted at him from close range. Cristiano Ronaldo converted the penalty, leveling the tie almost as soon as it had begun. And things got worse for Bayern when Madrid's German play maker Mesut Ozil slide a perfect pass into the path of Ronaldo who coolly slotted home his, and Madrid's, second. Incredibly the two goals were Ronaldo's 55th and 56th of the season. But even with a two-goal cushion Madrid never looked particularly comfortable following their exertions defeating arch-rivals Barcelona in the Spanish league last Saturday. ""The final will be disputed between the fifth team in the Premier League and the runners-up in the Bundesliga,"" Real coach Jose Mourinho said after failing to set up a clash with his former club Chelsea. ""Both used their reserve players this weekend, while Real Madrid and Barcelona faced each other in the most important match of the season in the Spanish league. People listened to me when I said the calendar had to be adjusted in these circumstances in Italy, and it made me happy. ""I don't have that power or enjoy such respect for my opinions here in Spain. We've started the most important month of the season with midweek games and it's resulted in yesterday's and tonight's results. Bayern won and were luckier than us."" The Portuguese coach lifted the trophy with Porto in 2004 and led Inter Milan to victory over Bayern in the 2010 final but has fallen at the last-four stage in his two seasons with Real -- and could also take Chelsea no further than the semis. With Germany international Mario Gomez causing Madrid's static defense problems and former Real and Chelsea player Arjen Robben using his pace to good effect, Bayern carved out chance after chance. It was to be another, less controversial penalty decision that would throw the visitors a lifeline when Portugal defender Pepe bundled over Gomez. Robben dispatched the penalty kick even though Iker Casillas got a hand to the ball. It wouldn't be the last time he would get his hand to a penalty kick. That goal meant that even though Madrid led 2-1 by halftime, the tie was level 3-3 on aggregate following Bayern's 2-1 first leg victory in Munich last week. Perhaps unsurprisingly the second half was a tense affair devoid of the fluidity that had marked the first period. The game ground down to an attritional stalemate as the final whistle was blown and the match went to extra time. Again the two teams couldn't be separated and the match went to penalty kicks. Ronaldo approached to take Madrid's first, having not missed a penalty all season with 13 goals from the spot. But sensationally his kick was saved by Bayern's Manuel Neuer. When Kaka saw Madrid's second penalty clawed away by an even better Neuer save, the home side seemed dead and buried. But Iker Casillas pulled out two stunning saves of his own to level the shootout. It wasn't to last. Sergio Ramos blasted over and Schweinsteiger stepped up to send the Germans home.","Bayern Munich will play Chelsea in the Champions League final .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The U.S. trade embargo on Cuba is endangering the health of millions by limiting Cubans' access to medicines and medical technology, human rights group Amnesty International alleged Wednesday. Amnesty International says the U.S. trade embargo is limiting Cubans' access to medical technology. An Amnesty report examines the effects of the sanctions, which have been in place since 1962. Amnesty International Secretary-General Irene Khan called the U.S. embargo immoral and said it should be lifted. ""It's preventing millions of Cubans from benefiting from vital medicines and medical equipment essential for their health,"" Khan said. The embargo restricts the export of medicines and medical equipment from the U.S. and from any U.S.-owned company abroad. Amnesty also called on President Obama to not renew the Trading with the Enemy Act, which is due for renewal on September 14. The Act has been reviewed by U.S. presidents on an annual basis since 1978. Amnesty said that while not renewing the Act would not in itself end the embargo against Cuba, it would send a clear message that the U.S. is adopting a new policy toward Cuba. In April this year President Obama lifted restrictions that had prevented U.S. citizens from visiting relatives in Cuba, and sending them remittances. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman would not comment on the report because she hadn't read it. However, she said, ""The president believes it makes strategic sense to hold on to some inducements we can use in dealing with a Cuban government if it shows any signs of seeking a normalized relationship with us and begins to respect basic human rights."" The Amnesty report also cites United Nations data that says Cuba's inability to import nutritional products for schools, hospitals and day care centers is contributing to a high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia. In 2007, the condition affected 37.5 percent of Cuba's children under three years old, according to UNICEF.   Watch a report on Cuba's health care system » . Cuba can import these products from other countries, but there are major shipping costs and logistical challenges to contend with. Gail Reed is international director of MEDICC (Medical Education Cooperation with Cuba), a non-profit organization that encourages cooperation among U.S., Cuban and global health communities. She told CNN, ""In general, the embargo has a sweeping effect on Cuban healthcare. Over the past decades, I would say the people most affected have been cancer and HIV-AIDS patients."" She also said the embargo affects the way doctors think about the future. ""Doctors in Cuba always worry that an international supplier will be bought out by a U.S. company, leaving medical equipment without replacement parts and patients without continuity of medications,"" Reed said. Gerardo Ducos, an Amnesty researcher for the Caribbean region, told CNN that although medicines and medical supplies can be licensed for export to Cuba, the conditions governing the process make their export virtually impossible. According to the report, the U.S. exported $710 million of food and agricultural products to Cuba in 2008, but only $1.2 million of medical equipment and products. Reed said the embargo does not permit the sale of active ingredients or raw materials to the Cuban pharmaceutical industry. She gave the example of methotrexate, used to treat breast cancer, telling CNN that an export license was denied to a firm wanting to sell the U.S.-produced active ingredient to Cuba, to be used in domestic production of the drug on the island. ""Four times as many women may be treated with methotrexate if the drug could be produced domestically, so that Cuban importers were not forced to purchase the finished product on the international pharmaceutical market,"" she said. The report says that products patented in the U.S. are covered by the embargo. Ducos told CNN that this particularly affects HIV/AIDS treatments. ""The latest medicines are usually covered by U.S. patents, which means Cuba must wait several years for the patent to run out before they can buy generic products,"" he said. In the statement, Khan added, ""Although responsibility for providing adequate health care lies primarily with the Cuban authorities, governments imposing sanctions such as embargoes need to pay special attention to the impact they can have on the targeted country's population.""","Amnesty report says Cuba embargo limits Cubans' access to medicine .

"(Budget Travel) -- Avoid the mile-long lines at the Times Square TKTS booth by buying discounted Broadway tickets using one of these eight approaches. Lining up at the Times Square TKTS booth isn't the only way to get discounted Broadway tickets. Crack the codes . When you're buying tickets online, the major agencies -- Telecharge and Ticketmaster -- ask for a promotional code, which can shave between 25 and 50 percent off the face-value price. You can find one of these codes by visiting Playbill, TheaterMania and BroadwayBox.com. These sites list promotional codes for many shows, including blockbuster productions like ""Hairspray."" Playbill and TheaterMania are more comprehensive but require registration. BroadwayBox.com posts a more limited number of codes, but you won't have to cough up any personal information. Insider's tip: If you buy directly from a theater box office, where you can also use a code for savings, you will avoid the fees that Telecharge and Ticketmaster slap on the tickets they sell online. Try a ticket broker . If you're gunning for one of Broadway's most popular shows, such as ""Grease"" or ""Spring Awakening,"" you're going to struggle to find discounted tickets from any source. Your best hope is to look for tickets during Broadway's slow months: January, February, September and October. You'll most likely find these tickets being resold by respected online ticket brokers, such as StubHub and TicketsNow -- often, though not always, at a discount to their face values. Buck the system at the 11th hour . General rush tickets and ticket lotteries are available to anyone looking to try his or her last-minute luck. Some productions, including ""The Color Purple"" and ""Chicago,"" sell a select number of discounted tickets, called rush tickets, at the box office on the day of the show. Others, such as ""Wicked"" and ""Avenue Q,"" hold lotteries in which people go to the theater a few hours before a show and enter their names in a drawing. Rush and lottery tickets usually cost between $20 and $30. Go to TalkinBroadway.com or Playbill.com for details on the rush and lottery practices of the top productions. Sit onstage . Two popular musicals offer onstage seating at a fraction of the standard prices. ""Spring Awakening"" sells 26 onstage seats at every performance for $31.50 a pop (which is far less than the typical $70 a seat); ""Xanadu"" sells 22 onstage seats for every performance at $41.50 apiece. These seats tend to have rear or side views that obscure some of the action, but they still sell out quickly because viewers get to sit so close. It's best to book ""Spring Awakening"" onstage seats about four months in advance; ""Xanadu"" onstage seats require a lead time of a week or two. Onstage seating is available at the box offices as well as through Telecharge. Tote the tots . Kids have some clout when it comes to ticket discounts. The Roundabout Theatre Company sells tickets for children under the age of 17 at half the price it charges adults. For example, in February a child's ticket costs only $25 for ""Sunday in the Park with George"" -- while an adult ticket is $50 (for a rear mezzanine seat in each case). Every winter, The Broadway League holds Kids' Night on Broadway. This year, anyone between the ages of 6 and 18 could see a Broadway show for free, when accompanied by a full-paying adult, on February 5, 6, 12 and 13. See details at kidsnightonbroadway.com. Take a stand . For theatergoers feeling light on their feet, sold-out shows can be a good thing. Many productions -- even hot shows like ""Jersey Boys"" and ""Spamalot"" -- offer standing room only (SRO) admission when no audience seats are left. Like rush tickets, most SRO tickets fall in the $20 to $30 range and can be purchased at the box office on the day of the show. Find out which productions offer SRO by visiting TalkinBroadway.com and Playbill.com. Become a member . The nonprofit Theatre Development Fund -- which also operates the red-and-white TKTS booths in Times Square and at the South Street Seaport that sell discounted, same-day tickets -- has a TDF membership program that offers advance tickets for less than $35 for some Broadway shows (without the hassle of standing in a line). To join, you have to be a student, a teacher, a union member, a senior, a civil service employee, a nonprofit or performing arts organization employee or a member of the armed forces or clergy. There's an annual membership fee of $27.50, but you can usually make up the difference in a single show, given that the average Broadway ticket goes for $76. Find membership details at tdf.org. Act your age . Students should check out theater company Web sites to see if any discounts are available. For example, the Roundabout Theatre Company's HipTix program offers $20 tickets, generally available two to three weeks before performances, for students and working professionals ages 18 to 35. Sign up for the program at hiptix.com; membership is free. Similarly, Lincoln Center Theater's StudenTix program offers $20 advance tickets for high school and college students. However, a limited number of people are accepted into the free program before membership closes every year; go to lct.org for more info. On occasion, a specific production, instead of a theater, will offer students discount tickets. For instance, Tom Stoppard's ""Rock 'n' Roll"" has been selling $26.50 student tickets at the box office of the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater. Student rush is a final, tried-and-true method. Many theaters set aside a limited number of student tickets -- typically running between $20 and $30 -- to sell at the box office on the day of the performance.

"(CNN) -- The Galaxy S4 mini, a slimmed-down version of Samsung's flagship smartphone, is on its way, the company announced Thursday. Widely rumored after an accidental leak, the company confirmed that the mini will be one of the products rolled out at a Samsung event in London on June 20. On the heels of a hot start for the Galaxy S4, which the company says sold 10 million units in less than a month, the Korean gadget-maker seems to be homing in on the rival iPhone with a handset that promises to be easier to grip than its bulkier cousins in the Galaxy line. The mini will have a 4.3-inch display screen, comparable to the iPhone 5's 4-inch screen, and weigh 3.77 ounces -- a pip lighter than the iPhone's 3.95. The Galaxy S4 has a 5-inch screen, while Samsung's Galaxy Note II ""phablet"" has a whopping 5.5-inch display. ""We want to give people more choices with Galaxy S4 mini, similar look and feel of Galaxy S4 for more compact and practical uses,"" J.K. Shin, CEO and president of Samsung's mobile division, said in a blog post. The new phone will feature an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera (down from the S4's 13 megapixels) and 2-megapixel front-facing camera. It also will come with 8GB of internal memory, running up to 64GB if, as with the S4, the user adds an available memory microchip. It will be a sleek 9mm wide (.35 inches), a hair wider than the iPhone 5's 7.6mm (.3 inches), and run the latest version of Google's Android operating system, Jelly Bean, with a 1.7 Ghz dual-core processor. The device will come in either white or black. No price or release date was announced. The announcement further illustrates the divergent mobile strategies of Samsung and Apple. While the Cupertino tech giant fine-tunes a single phone, Samsung floods the zone with a variety of models, ranging from low-end handsets to its more upscale Galaxy line. ""Samsung's overall smartphone strategy is about producing scores of iterations at various price points and screen sizes in order to saturate the market with as much of its hardware as possible,"" Natasha Lomas wrote for TechCrunch. ""(It's) a strategy that, coupled with its massive marketing budget, continues to be extremely successful for the Korean electronics giant, making it far harder for other Android (makers) such as HTC to compete with their far more modest device portfolios.""","Samsung announced that smaller version of its Galaxy S4 phone is coming .

"(CNN) -- A 37-year-old airline passenger was arrested Tuesday in Miami after primer caps for bullets ignited while a baggage handler was unloading a roll-on bag, the FBI said. The tarmac incident is not believed to be terrorism-related, FBI special agent Michael Leverock said. Leverock would not provide details or speculate on how the bag might have gotten on the plane. He compared the primer to a ""spark plug"" for the bullet. The unidentified passenger, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was bound for Jamaica, was charged with transportation of hazardous materials. If convicted, he could face a sentence of up to five years. The flight from Boston landed at Miami International Airport around 11:30 a.m., American Airlines said. The 737 had two pilots, four flight attendants and 148 passengers. Hundreds of the primer caps were in a bag that ignited, and all of them went off after the first one did, Leverock said. Several hit the baggage handler's shoes, but he was not injured. The bomb squad was among those who rushed to the scene. The incident caused four other flights to be delayed, the airport said. Leverock said part of a shirt inside the bag was charred, but the movement of the bag is what set off the explosion. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Man arrested after bag ignites on Miami tarmac .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona's Champions League title defense suffered a big blow in rainy London in midweek, and the Spanish club's hopes of a fourth successive La Liga crown were all but ended in similarly wet conditions on home turf on Saturday. Real Madrid moved seven points clear of their archrivals with just four games to play after clinching a tense 2-1 victory in the ""El Clasico"" clash -- Barcelona's first home defeat this season, ending a 54-game run in all competitions at the Camp Nou. Cristiano Ronaldo came out on top in his battle with Lionel Messi as his 73rd-minute winner took his league tally this season to 42 -- one more than the Argentine. ""We've taken a gigantic step in La Liga by defeating Barcelona,"" Real captain Iker Casillas told the club's website. ""There are still points in play and we must show respect for our opponents, but winning here is taking an important step in the championship. ""We behaved like a true team. Cristiano did an excellent job, but all of us played well from start to finish. It was a very important match and we earned a difficult victory."" The match was ominously similar to Wednesday's 1-0 defeat by Chelsea, as Barcelona dominated possession despite slippery conditions -- but failed to capitalize against a Madrid side who lost 2-1 to Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal. Clasico key to title race? While the English club caught Barca on the counterattack just before halftime, Real exposed the Catalan side's defensive weaknesses as Germany midfielder Sami Khedira scrambled in a 17th-minute opener after the home team failed to clear Angel di Maria's inswinging corner. It was Real's 108th goal in 34 league games this season -- a new record, beating Los Blancos' feat in the 1989-90 season. Barca coach Josep Guardiola brought Alexis Sanchez off the bench with just over 20 minutes to go, and the Chile forward made an instant impact as he bundled in an equalizer at the second attempt. Sanchez replaced Spain midfielder Xavi, who made a record 32nd Clasico appearance. However, the home crowd's relief was shortlived as Ronaldo beat the offside trip to gather Mesut Ozil's fine pass down the right, and the world's most expensive player netted his 54th goal this season from an acute angle. Messi has scored 63 in all competitions, but has now not netted in the last three Clasico matches -- and Barca have lost back to back for the first time since 2009. Real's former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho celebrated his second Clasico victory in 11 clashes, and first in the league, having won the Spanish Cup last year. The 49-year-old has already won titles in England, Italy and his native Portugal, and was under big pressure to end Barca's dominance this season. ""I congratulate Real Madrid for their victory and also for their league title which I have no doubt they have clinched tonight,"" Guardiola told reporters, as he defended his decision to leave Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique on the bench. ""I selected the team which I thought had the best chance to defeat Madrid."" Real had held a 10-point lead just over a month ago, but three draws allowed Barcelona -- who had won 11 games in a row -- to entertain hopes of closing the gap to just one this weekend. Guardiola's team still hold a 29-point lead over third-placed Valencia, who host Real Betis on Sunday. In Italy's Serie A, fourth-placed Udinese's Champions League hopes were dented by a 0-0 draw with mid-table Chievo on Saturday. The result left Udinese two points behind third-placed Lazio, who play on Sunday along with leaders Juventus and title-chasing deefnding champions AC Milan. Napoli moved up to fifth with a 2-0 win at home to second-bottom Novara.","Cristiano Ronaldo's winner in Clasico puts Real Madrid seven points clear .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi's became Barcelona's highest goalscorer of all time after his hat-trick against Granada helped the Spanish champions close on La Liga leaders Real Madrid. The Argentina striker, who is still only 24 years old, took his tally to 234 goals for the club to overtake Cesar Rodriguez, who had a prolific spell for Barca in the 1940s and '50s. Messi took his tally for the season to 54 in 45 games as Barca's 5-3 victory on Tuesday helped cut the gap to rivals Real to just five points. Barca have played a game more than Real, but now the second league ""El Clasico"" of the season between the two clubs scheduled for April 22 looks increasingly pivotal in the title race. ""We are witnessing the best player in every sense,"" said Messi's coach Josep Guardiola. ""He does everything, and he does it every three days. ""I'm sorry for those that want to sit on his throne, but this lad is the best. Hopefully we can enjoy his football for many more years."" Guardiola compared Messi's dominance in football to the basketball supremacy of NBA legend Michael Jordan. ""Leo has rightfully entered into history,"" he said. ""There are few players that dominate in this fashion, and he does it."" A recent study by Barcelona's Center of Documentation and Studies discovered that Cesar had scored 232 goals in competitive matches, not 235 as previously thought. And Messi wasted little time in equaling Cesar's tally, with a crisp volley after Isaac Cuenca's cross had fallen to him on the right edge of the box after 17 minutes. His opening goal made it 2-0 on the night after Messi had teed up Spain midfielder Xavi for the first after only six minutes. But Granada -- placed 15th in the 20-team division -- stunned Barca in the second half as Diego Mainz headed a free-kick past Victor Valdes before Dani BenÃ­tez drew a foul from Dani Alves in the box and Guillherme Siqueira fired home from the penalty spot. The visitors weren't level for long as Alves floated a ball over their defense for Messi, who controlled and lobbed Granada goalkeeper Julio Cesar to spark a prolonged round of celebrations with his teammates. Tello added a fifth for Barca when he slotted home in the final 10 minutes after Messi had been denied by Cesar. The gloss was removed ever so slightly from Messi's record-breaking night when Alves was sent off after conceding another penalty, converted by Siqueira, and defender Adriano was sidelined for 10 days with a leg injury. In La Liga's other game on Tuesday, Osasuna moved into sixth place in the table despite drawing 0-0 with Getafe, who remain 11th. Elsewhere, Juventus booked a place in the Italian Cup final after Mirko Vucinic's extra-time strike sealed a 4-3 aggregate win over AC Milan. Leading 2-1 from the first leg, Juve edged further ahead when veteran striker Alessandro Del Piero scored on 28 minutes but Serie A leaders Milan hit back with goals from Djamel Mesbah and Maxi Lopez to force an extra half an hour. But Vucinic's goal five minutes into the extra period settled the tie. Juve will face either Napoli or Siena in the final -- they play on Wednesday with Napoli trailing 2-1 from the first leg. Meanwhile, Blackburn Rovers boosted their hopes of English Premier League survival with a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Ewood Park. Striker Junior Hoilett opened the scoring with a 58th-minute volley to record his third goal in two games before a late Yakubu header sealed back-to-back wins for Rovers, who moved six points clear of the drop zone.","Lionel Messi becomes highest scorer in Barcelona's history after hat-trick against Granada .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Democratic leaders are putting together a second economic stimulus package that could cost as much as $150 billion, according to Democratic leadership aides. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said the economic crisis may warrant a $150 billion stimulus package. The aides said Democrats are likely to call Congress back shortly after the election to vote on the measure. The details are still in flux, but one aide said the price tag would be ""somewhat north of $100 billion"" and would include ""a heavy emphasis on help to state and local governments."" One way to help states would be to fund the mandatory state match for Medicaid programs so that states would not have to slash education and other programs to cover it. Before Congress recessed last week for the election, the House of Representatives passed economic aid measures totaling $61 billion to fund infrastructure projects, money for states' Medicaid costs, and unemployment assistance. But these bills failed to attract enough support in the Senate, and the White House opposed them. ""With all that happened in the past few weeks, it probably has to be more like ... $150 billion to invest in our economy, to create jobs, to help the states, to help men and women across the country,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said Wednesday while traveling in Denver, Colorado. Pelosi and other House Democratic leaders are scheduled to meet Monday with a group of economists in Washington to discuss the size and components of a stimulus plan, the Democratic aides said. These aides indicated that in addition to aid to states struggling with their budgets, the package could include things similar to what the House passed before, such as infrastructure money, an extension of unemployment benefits, food stamps and more money for low-income energy assistance. House Republican leadership aides said that GOP members have not been consulted on the details of a second stimulus. One of these aides said, ""We're not necessarily opposed to it out of hand. We would ask, is it truly stimulative? Is it really going to help stimulate the economy?"" A Senate GOP leadership aide said Republicans are skeptical of a second stimulus but did not suggest there is outright opposition to another package. Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, left the door open to the Senate taking up a bill. ""Sen. Reid tried to pass a second economic recovery bill last month, only to be obstructed by Senate Republicans,"" Manley said. ""Recent developments only reinforce the need for additional action to reinvigorate the economy. We will work with the House of Representatives and leave all options open to address this issue.""","Democrats say it's likely they will call Congress back after election to vote .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed emergency legislation Tuesday that bars protests within 300 feet of a funeral and within an hour from its beginning or end. Earlier in the day, the state legislature passed the measure, which targets a Kansas church whose members announced they plan to picket the funerals of the victims of Saturday's shootings in Tucson. ""Such despicable acts of emotional terrorism will not be tolerated in the State of Arizona,"" Brewer said in a statement announcing she had signed the bill. ""This legislation will assure that the victims of Saturday's tragic shooting in Tucson will be laid to rest in peace with the full dignity and respect that they deserve."" The legislation makes protesting too near a funeral a misdemeanor in the state. It went into effect immediately upon Brewer's signing it. The action is in direct response to the Westboro Baptist Church's announcement that it will picket the funeral of Christina Green, the 9-year-old who was among six people killed during Saturday's attempted assassination of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona. The controversial church, based in Topeka, has made its name by staging protests at funerals of people who died of AIDS, gay people, soldiers and even Coretta Scott King. The church was founded by Fred Phelps, 80, and most of its members are members of his extended family. ""Today we have joined together to provide some small measure of comfort for families grieving over the lost of a loved one,"" said Democratic state Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. ""During times of grief, families should be free from harassment or intimidation. This law does the right thing by protecting those families."" ""Protesting or picketing outside the funeral of an innocent victim is despicable,"" said Republican state House Speaker Kirk Adams. ""It's time to bring Arizona in line with the many other states that protect the sensitivities of victims against groups that use fear and hate to denigrate the lives of Americans."" Within hours of the church's announcements, Facebook groups sprang up to plan actions surrounding the funerals that would keep the church members separate from the mourners. Tucson just isn't that kind of town, says Christin Gilmer, 26, referring to the actions of the church. ""For something like this to happen in Tucson was a really big shock to us all,"" she said. ""Our nightmare happened when we saw Westboro Baptist Church was going to picket the funerals."" Gilmer and others are planning an ""angel action"" -- with 8-by-10-foot ""angel wings"" worn by participants to shield mourners from picketers. Angel actions were created by Coloradan Romaine Patterson, who was shocked to find the Topeka church and its multicolored signs outside the 1999 funeral of Matthew Shepard, a young gay man beaten and left on a fence to die in Laramie, Wyoming. The angel action is part of a larger effort, organized by Chelsea Cohen, a 20-year-old University of Arizona senior, aimed at showing what she said are Tucson's true colors. ""Once I heard that the Westboro Baptist Church was coming, I felt like something should be done to show support for the families,"" she said. ""I don't have any experience in organizing these things. I thought I might get 50 to 100 people."" ""This isn't a counter-protest,"" she said. ""We wanted it to show support for the families and to show that Tucson is there with love and support."" The groups don't want to interfere with the funeral in any way, Cohen said. ""We plan on being completely silent, and we're asking people not to bring signs or make comments about the Westboro Baptist Church,"" she said. Jeff Rogers, chairman of the Pima County Democratic Party, said Tuesday that his organization as well as the local Republican Party also will ask people to line the funeral routes to form a barricade if the church follows through on its planned protest. Westboro Baptist Church spokeswoman Shirley Phelps-Roper, daughter of Fred Phelps, provided CNN with a statement detailing their decision to picket the funerals. It is filled with anti-gay, anti-abortion and anti-divorce rhetoric that members have used in the past to justify their pickets -- that God hates America because it has turned its back on what they see as God's way. ""We picket the funerals to make these vital points to the living!"" Phelps-Roper said. ""If you heed, it is life and health and peace and safety. ""God sent the shooter!"" the statement continued. ""Praise God for ALL his works, and BE YE THANKFUL!."" CNN's Alyse Shorland and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","NEW: Gov. Jan Brewer signed the bill Tuesday night .

"KURUTHU, India (CNN)  -- In a single, tragic day, Chandrasekhar Sankurathri lost everything he loved. More than 137,000 cataract surgeries have been performed at Chandrasekhar Sankurathri's eye hospital. ""Nobody should go through what I've been through in my life,"" he says. Sankurathri's wife and two young children were flying on Air India Flight 182 from Ottawa, Canada, to Bombay, India (now known as Mumbai), in 1985 when a bomb exploded, killing everyone on board. ""I used to think maybe they landed someplace. Maybe somebody rescued them, you know,"" he says. For three years he stumbled through his daily routine as a biologist in Ottawa, not wanting to believe the truth. ""I was really lost,"" he remembers. After considerable soul-searching, Sankurathri made a decision few others might -- to turn his personal pain into an opportunity to help those less fortunate. In 1988, he quit his job, sold his home and returned to India, where he was born, and where he believed he could do the most good. ""India has so many problems,"" says Sankurathri, 64. Two in particular caught his attention: a lack of school attendance and rampant blindness. With the money he had, Sankurathri created a foundation in his wife's name, and in turn, built a school and an eye hospital in the small rural village of Kuruthu, not far from his wife's birthplace. Today, his foundation's efforts to empower the poor through education and health care are having significant success. Since it's creation in 1992, Sarada School -- named for the 4-year-old daughter Sankurathri lost -- has grown from one grade to nine. More than 1,200 students have graduated and many of them have gone on to high school and college. Sankurathri keeps in touch with past students. ""We act like a big family,"" he says. In a country where the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization estimates the national primary school dropout rate is more than 50 percent, Sankurathri proudly says that not one of his students has ever dropped out.  Watch Sankurathri talk about the school he started in memory of his family » . The same buses that pick up students for Sankurathri's school in the morning are often used later in the day to bring eye care patients from other rural areas to the Srikiran Institute of Ophthalmology, Sankurathri's eye hospital, named for the 7-year-old son he lost. Since the hospital's opening in 1993, more than 137,000 cataract surgeries have been performed, 90 percent of them free. ""We see close to 350 outpatients a day and perform 80 surgeries per day,"" he says. ""Our mission is to provide quality eye care with compassion, which is equitable, accessible and affordable to all."" But Sankurathri has found that getting patients the care they need often requires educating the public first. ""In India, people are so ignorant. They think cataract blindness is not curable,"" he says. ""They are not aware that it is curable and that it is a simple operation."" In fact, about 75 percent of India's estimated 15 million blind people could avoid blindness with prevention or medical treatment, according to Vision 2020 India. Sankurathri is amazed and delighted by the transformation that occurs after each cataract surgery.  Watch Sankurathri explain how he is helping the blind to see again » . ""Just within a few hours, you make their lives totally different,"" he says. ""Their whole life changes -- the way they walk, they act, they smile."" The goal, Sankurathri says, is not only to help the blind see again, but also to lead a better life. Sankurathri has been back in India for almost 20 years. He insists his work does not make him special. ""I'm just an ordinary human being trying to do my best to help others.""  Watch Sankurathri explain how he turned his personal grief into the gift of sight for thousands » . He also believes his journey to honor those he loved has not been a solitary one.

"(CNN) -- Josep Guardiola has confirmed he is to step down as Barcelona coach at the end of this season, saying four years in charge of one of the world's biggest clubs is an eternity. The record-breaking coach cited tiredness as the major factor in his decision, saying he needed a prolonged break to rediscover his energy and enthusiasm for the game. At an emotional press conference in Barcelona, attended by many of the team's star players, the club's president Sandro Rosell confirmed Guardiola's number two, Tito Villanova, is to take over next season. ""Four years on the Barcelona bench is an eternity, "" Guardiola explained. ""I want you to understand this is not a simple decision for me. I'm sorry deeply for the confusion in the last few weeks. Spain in shock as 'God-like' Guardiola quits Barcelona . ""At beginning of December I announced to the chairman that I was seeing the end of my era at Barcelona. He or I couldn't say that publicly. ""I had to announce this today because I didn't want to continue with the confusion. The reason is simple, four years is very tiring. ""I'm drained and I need to fill up. The demand has been very high and a manager must be strong. The new coach will give things I'm not able to anymore."" The 41-year-old's announcement comes at the end of a disappointing week for the Spanish club, whose European title defense came to a halt just days after a defeat by arch-rivals Real Madrid all but ended its three-season domestic reign. Guardiola joined Barcelona as a 13-year-old and won six La Liga titles and one European Cup as a player with the club. He presided over an unprecedented treble in his first season in charge, winning the Champions League, La Liga and the Spanish Cup, having been promoted from his role as coach of the Barcelona reserve side in May 2008. He won the Champions League again last season and also a third successive Spanish title, followed by success at the Club World Cup for a second time in December 2011. He won a total of 13 trophies during his tenure. However, he never signed a long term contact and revealed he had made the decision to quit before the turn of the year. Barcelona's president Sandro Rosell called Guardiola the best coach in the history of the club, and said: ""Thank you Pep for perfecting our football model, it can never be questioned again."" Under Guardiola, Barcelona acquired the reputation of being the most attractive team in the world to watch, spearheaded by the sublime goalscoring exploits of three-time world player of the year Lionel Messi. The Argentina striker was not present at the press conference and later explained why on his page on the social networking site Facebook. ""I want to thank Pep with all my heart for everything he has given me in my professional career and personally,"" the 24-year-old wrote. ""Because of the emotions I feel I preferred not to be present at Pep's press conference and to stay away from the press because I know they will look for the pain on the players' faces. It is something I decided not to show."" Guardiola acknowledged the intense demands of coaching one of the world's most high profile clubs prompted him to relinquish the reins. Despite speculation linking him to other jobs, he confirmed he would be taking a break from the game. ""You can only recover by resting,"" he said. ""It would have been a bad decision to continue. We have lived too many strong things together to run the risk that this goes wrong. ""I know this is the best possible place, but it is my time to go. I'm satisfied beyond the results in the way we've done it. ""I want to thank my players, who have been responsible for everything that has happened. It has been a pleasure to train them. ""It's been a million games I've imagined but they made it reality. Day by day for so many years they made it possible."" Guardiola said he recalled jumping up and down like a little boy when he was asked to take over as coach of Barcelona's 'B' team in 2007. ""I need to recover that feeling,"" he said. ""Time has taken its toll. It's been three days of madness but it had to happen. ""I am proud of everyone I work with. This club is a powerful force -- it is unstoppable. The one that will replace me (Villanova) is very able to take this on.""","Josep Guardiola will stand down as coach of Barcelona at the end of this season .

"(CNN) -- In protest of what it calls a religion ""of the devil,"" a nondenominational church in Gainesville, Florida, plans to host an ""International Burn a Quran Day"" on the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks. The Dove World Outreach Center says it is hosting the event to remember 9/11 victims and take a stand against Islam. With promotions on its website and Facebook page, it invites Christians to burn the Muslim holy book at the church from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. ""We believe that Islam is of the devil, that it's causing billions of people to go to hell, it is a deceptive religion, it is a violent religion and that is proven many, many times,"" Pastor Terry Jones told CNN's Rick Sanchez earlier this week. Jones wrote a book titled ""Islam is of the Devil,"" and the church sells coffee mugs and shirts featuring the phrase. Muslims and many other Christians -- including some evangelicals -- are fighting the initiative. The church launched a YouTube channel to disseminate its messages. ""I mean ask yourself, have you ever really seen a really happy Muslim? As they're on the way to Mecca? As they gather together in the mosque on the floor? Does it look like a real religion of joy?"" Jones asks in one of his YouTube posts. ""No, to me it looks like a religion of the devil."" The Islamic advocacy group Council on American-Islamic Relations called on Muslims and others to host ""Share the Quran"" dinners to educate the public during the monthlong fast of Ramadan beginning in August. In a news release, the group announced a campaign to give out 100,000 copies of the Quran to local, state and national leaders. ""American Muslims and other people of conscience should support positive educational efforts to prevent the spread of Islamophobia,"" said CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper in the release. The National Association of Evangelicals, the nation's largest umbrella evangelical group, issued a statement urging the church to cancel the event, warning it could cause worldwide tension between the two religions. ""The NAE calls on its members to cultivate relationships of trust and respect with our neighbors of other faiths. God created human beings in his image, and therefore all should be treated with dignity and respect,"" it said in the statement. Dove's Facebook page, set up for the September event, has more than 1,600 fans. ""Eternal fire is the only destination the Quran can lead people to, so we want to put the Quran in it's [sic] place -- the fire!"" the page says. But another Facebook group with more than 3,100 fans says it stands ""against the disrespect and intolerance that these people have for the Muslim people"" and encourages people to report Dove's page to Facebook. Targeting another group it calls ""godless,"" the Dove center is also hosting a protest against Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe, who is openly gay, on Monday at Gainesville's City Hall. The group previously fought -- unsuccessfully -- to derail Lowe's election campaign. ""We protest sexual perversion because the Bible protests it. ... What is acceptable to today's leadership becomes acceptable to tomorrow's society,"" the church says in its blog entry about the event. Lowe and other government figures and media outlets received e-mails from the church about the event, The Gainesville Sun reported. Lowe isn't concerned with Monday's event. ""I've got other things to do,"" he said, The Sun reports. On the outreach center's front lawn, alongside a sign reading ""Aug. 2 Protest, No Homo Mayor, City Hall,"" stands not just one, but three signs bearing the slogan ""Islam is of the Devil."" One of the signs -- one reading ""Islam"" on one side, ""Devil"" on the other -- was vandalized. On its blog last week, the church said the sign will be replaced. ""This is private property and vandalism is a crime here in America,"" the blog says. ""In Islam, many actions that we consider to be crimes are encouraged, condoned or sheltered under Islamic teaching and practice, though. Another reason to burn a Quran.""","Dove World Outreach Center to host ""International Burn a Quran Day""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. military coalition in Iraq confirmed Tuesday that a business jet -- not a U.S. military aircraft -- was recently forced down in Iran due to an airspace violation. A Falcon business jet is shown in an undated file photo. ""The airplane is now being confirmed as a light transport plane with no Americans onboard,"" Multi-National Forces-Iraq said in a statement issued Tuesday. ""From what we have been seeing, it was a Falcon business jet. We have accounted for all our aircraft and none are missing."" The U.S. coalition in Iraq had no information on who owned the aircraft, stressing that it was not a registered American plane. Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency initially reported that five American military officials were on board the U.S. aircraft. But other Iranian media reports -- quoting Iranian officials -- said the aircraft was Hungarian and no Americans were on the plane. Iranian officials told Iran's state-run Arabic language channel Al-Alam that the incident happened a week ago and that the plane was carrying humanitarian workers. Fars later changed its Farsi language report, citing other Iranian and Arab media as saying the plane was not an American aircraft . Fars also initially reported that aircraft, which it called a ""Falcon fighter,"" entered Iranian airspace at a low altitude from Turkey to avoid radar detection, despite repeated warnings by the Islamic Republic Air Force. It said the plane also carried three civilians. Washington is monitoring the reports, but White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said ""as far as we know (they are) totally bogus."" U.S. National Security Council Spokesman Gordon Johndroe also said there is no indication that the reports are accurate. ""We're looking into the various and conflicting reports coming from the Iranian 'news' agencies, but do not have any information at this time that would lead us to believe they are correct,"" he said. Fars said the aircraft, which was en route to Afghanistan, was forced to land at an Iranian airport that it did not name. Fars reported that the eight people aboard were released ""after daylong interrogations"" that revealed the aircraft had ""unintentionally"" violated Iran's airspace. Fars said the aircraft was later allowed to continue on to Afghanistan. Two top U.S. military officials told CNN's Barbara Starr that no U.S. military aircraft has been forced down. The U.S. military has an F-16 Fighting Falcon, but it is a one-seat jet fighter aircraft that is used by the U.S. Air Force for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. The Dassault Falcon is a European-made private passenger business jet that resembles a Lear jet. It can seat a crew of two and as many as 10 passengers. It's used for passenger transport, but also has military uses.

"(CNN) -- The Poison Pill. The Doomsday Files. Or simply, The Insurance. Whatever you call the file Julian Assange has threatened to release if he's imprisoned or dies or WikiLeaks is destroyed, it's impossible to stop. ""It's all tech talk to say, 'I have in my hand a button and if I press it or I order my friends to press it, it will go off,'"" said Hemu Nigam, who has worked in computer security for more than two decades, in the government and private sector. ""Julian is saying, 'I've calibrated this so that no matter how many ways you try, you're never going to be able to deactivate it,'"" Nigam said. ""He's sending a call to action to hackers to try it. To the government, he's also saying, 'Try me.'"" Read more about Nigam's experience and the Pentagon's cyber security . There's a reason Assange specifically announced -- on the Web -- that there is a 256-bit key encryption code that only a few trusted associates know that will unleash the contents of the 1.4 gigabyte-size file. ""He's saying don't even bother trying. It will take you so long to succeed that by that time, it will be too late,"" Nigam said. ""Most of the time, you see a 56-[bit]key encryption. That's considered secure. When you are using 256, you are sending a message: 'I'm smart enough to know that you will try to get in.'"" It's not the first time Assange, the face and founder of WikiLeaks, has asked someone to dare him. He and the anonymous, globally scattered WikiLeaks staff have warned since July's release of Afghanistan War documents that they are not to be messed with. Press them, they say, and they will retaliate by releasing more secret information. But this week, the stakes got higher. Assange was arrested Tuesday in Great Britain in relation to a sex crimes investigation in Sweden. A British judge denied bail, and Assange is expected to remain in a jail in England for at least a week, officials said. Assange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, called evidence against his client ""very thin"" and he will fight extradition to Sweden. Assange has called the rape allegations a ""smear campaign."" Often described as suspicious and even paranoid, Assange reportedly refused on Tuesday to be photographed or fingerprinted or have a swab of his DNA taken, all standard procedures for British arrests. Who is Julian Assange? Is the arrest politically motivated, a witch hunt for the man responsible for stoking the ire of the U.S. government by sharing with the world its confidential and sensitive war-time intelligence? The Pentagon has denied that. Nevertheless, the public is eating up this modern-day spy novel in which the main character's deadliest weapon is a computer. ""We will release more cables"" -- WikiLeaks tweet . Assange has repeatedly said that stopping him would not stop WikiLeaks. Tuesday night, the organization fulfilled a tweet earlier in the day: ""Today's actions against our editor-in-chief Julian Assange won't affect our operations: we will release more cables tonight as normal"" More cables -- at least 75 -- were indeed released Tuesday, several having to do with Libya. Demonstrating the democracy of the internet, supporters with $35 for a domain name and a basic knowledge of HTML are giving WikiLeaks an assist. Hundreds of Web sites have popped up which appear to have copied WikiLeaks' data for display on ""mirror sites."" Some sites are offering a how-to guide on mirroring. While that's happening, an anonymous group of hackers apparently hacked PayPal, one of the service providers that cut off service to WikiLeaks. Smaller tokens of support could be found on Time magazine's site. As of Thursday afternoon, Assange was leading against more than 25 other candidates to be the magazine's Person of the Year with more than 320,000 votes cast online. Ben Laurie, a London-based computer security expert who has reportedly advised WikiLeaks in the past, said Assange is nothing if not exacting. ""Julian's a smart guy, and this is an interesting tactic,"" Laurie told reporters. ""He will hope it deters anyone from acting against him."" Years to crack code . It could take an incalculable number of years to figure out the combination of letters, numbers and symbols comprising the 256-bit key code. It's anyone's guess what's in the file labeled ""insurance.aes256."" But few doubt that it's interesting. That massive file size is big enough to hold the contents of all of the group's leaks since July: 90,000 secret intelligence documents about the Afghanistan War; 400,000 pages of classified intel about the Iraq War, and purportedly more than a quarter million cables authored by U.S. diplomats. Assange has said in previous interviews that Bank of America leaked him a hard drive, and he's warned that WikiLeaks is planning a major leak about a large bank, according to Forbes. Assange has also claimed to have files on oil giant BP. Reports of the ""poison pill"" file containing any sort of ""nuclear bomb of information are completely over exaggerated,"" Jennifer Robinson, one of Assange¹s lawyers, told CNN. Assange has hinted that whatever information he has, it's unredacted. WikiLeaks came under tremendous fire this summer after its release of the Afghan War logs. Human rights organizations and government officials across the world said that the group's failure to remove the names of informants who had helped coalition forces in Afghanistan put those sources in grave jeopardy. Assange told Time that he was not aware of anyone ever hurt by a WikiLeaks document release. Read the full transcript . If the ""poison pill"" file is opened and its contents published online, it becomes easier to trace who might be involved, Nigam said. But it will still be hard. ""You could have your IP address visible and accessible to trace,"" he said. ""But if your goal is to hide your identity, then you will use proxy servers, hide your ID through rerouting so that information bounces from place to place until the person chasing you ends up in a dead zone. You could leave traces behind by accident, but I think we are safe in saying people affiliated with this situation know what they're doing."" Nigam was one of the first prosecutors in the U.S. Justice Department to pursue internet child predators. He's experienced in investigating cases using online techniques, but also in the real world. ""The government would be wise not to focus on the technical, and instead concentrate on finding and talking with people who were around Assange in the last few years, the people who he trusts,"" Nigam said. Technology won't turn on a friend, he said, but people will.","Expert: ""Julian [Assange] is saying 'I've calibrated this so that ... you're never going to deactivate it""

"(CNN) -- Brutal terrain and bad weather on a remote Alaska mountain kept survivors waiting 12 hours for rescue after a plane crash that killed former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens and four others, officials and witnesses said Tuesday. ""The weather was very challenging for those responding,"" said Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Investigators will be on the scene Wednesday morning. Pilots flying over the crash site said the amphibious DeHavilland DHC-3T Otter flew into the side of the mountain, which has a 40-degree slope, on Monday night and skidded about 200 feet, CNN's Casey Wian reported. The pilots didn't believe anyone on board had survived, but four did. There was no fire on the scene, Hersman said at a news conference. The area was so rugged and rocky that rescuers airlifted in a physician with a satellite phone, and the doctor had to hike 1,000 feet to reach the site, she said. Five volunteers, including some with medical training, assisted and stabilized the survivors overnight, officials said. One of the survivors was outside the fuselage when the doctor arrived, Wian reported. The cause of the crash was not known late Tuesday, but Maj. Guy Hayes of the Alaska National Guard said weather will certainly be considered. ""Poor weather always remains a factor when you are out here ... weather can change drastically,"" Hayes told CNN. The crash claimed the lives of passengers both young and old. The Alaska Department of Public Safety identified the dead as Stevens, of Anchorage, Alaska; pilot Theron ""Terry"" Smith, 62, of Eagle River, Alaska; lobbyist William ""Bill"" Phillips Sr. of the Washington, D.C., area; GCI executive Dana Tindall, 48, of Anchorage, Alaska; and her daughter Corey Tindall, 16, of Anchorage, Alaska. The bodies have been recovered and sent to Anchorage. Injured were William ""Willy"" Phillips Jr., 13, son of Bill Phillips Sr.; Sean O'Keefe, 54; his son, Kevin O'Keefe; and lobbyist Jim Morhard, Alexandria, Virginia. Alaska's Federal Aviation Administration office said two survivors had serious injuries and two had minor injuries and were hospitalized in Anchorage. Sean O'Keefe was listed in critical condition, and Kevin O'Keefe was in serious condition late Tuesday, said Kirsten Schultz, a spokeswoman for Providence Alaska Medical Center. The aircraft, on a fishing trip, crashed around 7 p.m. Monday about 17 miles north of Dillingham in the southwestern area of the state, authorities said. When the nine people onboard had not arrived at a camp on time, the search began. The pilot was not required to file a flight plan, authorities said. The Dillingham region, near the Bering Sea southwest of Anchorage, is rugged terrain surrounded by mountains. Storms there don't move quickly during this time of year but aren't as strong as those in winter, said Rob Marciano, CNN meteorologist. ""We haven't seen visibility improve much, so fog is an issue, and we haven't seen much in the way of that clearing,"" he said. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Paul Takemoto said the plane was registered to GCI Communications Corp., based in Anchorage. Bush pilots commonly use such planes. FAA spokesman Mike Fergus said the plane took off at 2 p.m. Monday from a GCI corporate site on Lake Nerka, heading to the Agulowak Lodge on Lake Aleknagik, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Because of its vast size, air travel is common in Alaska, often through perilous weather. Stevens expressed his own fears after a 1978 crash that killed his first wife and four others. ""Plane crashes are the occupational hazard of Alaska politics,"" Stevens told The Washington Post in 1979. The Post added, ""He said he often felt as if one's number had to come up eventually, and even though he had been a fighter pilot in World War II, the prospect of flying around in his campaign frightened him."" In 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and U.S. Rep. Nick Begich were traveling in a plane that is thought to have crashed in Alaska. It was never found. Nick Begich was the father of one of Alaska's current U.S. senators, Mark Begich. Stevens, 86, was remembered Tuesday as a ""lion who retreated before nothing"" and for being a guiding light in the formation of the 49th state. Tributes poured in all day for the hard-nosed Stevens, 86, who was the longest-serving Republican in the U.S. Senate's history and a champion for Alaska. ""Though small of stature, Ted Stevens seemed larger than life. For he built Alaska. And stood for Alaska. And he fought for Alaskans,"" Gov. Sean Parnell said at a news conference. ""How can we summarize six decades of service?"" President Barack Obama extended his condolences to the families, including that of Stevens, who flew in support of the Flying Tigers in the Pacific Theater in World War II. ""A decorated World War II veteran, Senator Ted Stevens devoted his career to serving the people of Alaska and fighting for our men and women in uniform,"" Obama said in a written statement. News of the latest crash reverberated across the state and country. Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, said Stevens fought tenaciously for Alaska. ""In our land of towering mountains and larger-than-life characters, none were larger than the man who in 2000 was voted Alaskan of the Century. This decorated World War II pilot was a warrior and a true champion of Alaska,"" Palin said in a statement. Stevens earned the nickname ""Uncle Ted"" and a reputation as one of the most effective of all pork-barrel lawmakers, a senator who funneled billions of federal dollars to his home state. His footprint can be seen all over Alaska. In Anchorage, where most people fly into the Alaska, a large sign proclaims ""Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport."" Born November 18, 1923, Stevens graduated from UCLA and Harvard Law School and moved to Alaska in the 1950s to work as a lawyer. He was elected to the state's House of Representatives in 1964 and 1966, and he was elected to the U.S. Senate for the first time in 1968. In July 2008, a federal grand jury indicted Stevens for making false statements on financial disclosure forms. He was convicted on October 27, 2008. During the trial, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich said Stevens hid ""hundreds of thousands of dollars of freebies"" he received from oil industry executive Bill Allen's company, VECO, and from Allen himself. Many of the allegedly free services were given as part of the renovation of Stevens' Alaska home, prosecutors said. The next month, Stevens lost a bid for re-election to Democratic challenger Mark Begich, then the mayor of Anchorage. Later, a federal judge later dismissed Stevens' conviction, citing prosecutorial misconduct. Stevens' defenders proclaimed his innocence and said he was vindicated. Olympic gold medalist Donna de Varona, who was a character witness at Stevens' trial, remembered him for improving the U.S. Olympics team's organization and championing Title IX, which provided equality for girls in the classroom and sports world. ""He thought everyone should have an equal opportunity,"" de Varona, a broadcaster and consultant, told CNN. The Stevens family released a statement later Tuesday. ""Alaska and the nation he so loved have lost a great man.  We have lost a tremendous husband and father and grandfather. He loved Alaska with all his heart. He was a guiding light through statehood and the development of the 49th state. Now that light is gone but the warmth and radiance of his life and his work will shine forever in the last frontier.  His legacy is the 49th star on the American flag."" Parnell ordered state and U.S. flags to be lowered to half-staff in honor of Stevens. ""This state is in mourning,"" said Sharon Leighnow, Parnell's press secretary. ""Everybody has a Ted Stevens story."" CNN's Scott Thompson, Mark Morgenstein, Phil Gast, Paul Vercammen and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","Former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe in critical condition .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Every family has its own set of holiday traditions. Some spend the day opening gifts and stuffing themselves with turkey, while others volunteer at soups kitchens, sing in the church choir or take in a movie. The families of America's biggest music stars are no different. At country music star Tim McGraw's house, the holidays are a time to celebrate his mother's Italian heritage. ""I grew up with pasta on Christmas Eve,"" he says. ""So it's passed on to me now. I make the pasta every Christmas Eve. We have spaghetti and meatballs."" Tim says he doesn't mind doing the cooking...but don't ask him to pick up anything at the mall. ""I like giving money so I don't have to shop,"" he says. Oprah.com: Make dinner for 20 with the greatest of ease . While Tim's favorite gift to give is one-size-fits-all, the best gift he ever received was a one-of-a-kind. ""Our youngest daughter was born under 4 pounds, and she was seven or eight weeks early,"" he says. ""[That year], we got to bring her home right before Christmas."" For musicians who tour for months at a time, the holidays are the perfect time of year to reconnect with loved ones. Singer Alicia Keys says this is the one time of the year she and her family gather to enjoy each other's company. Oprah.com: 20 songs to put on your holiday mix CD . ""We cook, and we play cards. We all sit around, and we catch up,"" she says. ""You have hot apple cider, and you have the eggnog and all of the food."" Some years, Alicia's mom hosts the holiday gatherings, and other years, Alicia says she invites everyone to her house. ""This year, I think it will be at my house,"" she says. When it comes time to give gifts, Alicia says it's only fun if it feels authentic. ""Otherwise, it's about being together,"" she says. Alicia says love is the best gift she's ever received...but her cute bolero jacket ranks high on the list! Oprah.com: Great gifts under $50 . Christmas means different foods, carols and customs around the world, but the spirit of the season stays the same.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of residents began evacuating Sunday morning from coastal Japan in anticipation of a possible tsunami following Chile's 8.8-magnitude earthquake. The northern part of the main island was looking at the possibility of a tsunami at least 9 feet high, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Rail service was halted in coastal areas and residents were urged to evacuate low-lying areas of the island nation. The warning primarily affected fishing areas and tourist areas; major cities like Tokyo, which is inland, were not affected. Sunday's alert was Japan's first major tsunami warning in more than 15 years, the agency reported. A tsunami spawned by Chile's 1960 earthquake killed 140 people in Japan. On Saturday, tsunami warnings from Chile's temblor initially covered the entire Pacific region, but they were canceled less than 18 hours later except for Russia, Japan and the Philippines. The Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology issued a Level-2 tsunami alert for the east coast of the Philippines. A Level-2 alert means people are advised to stay away from the shoreline; residents near coastal areas facing the Pacific Ocean are advised to go farther inland. Meanwhile, an official with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the island chain of Hawaii ""dodged a bullet"" after smaller-than-expected waves were reported. Coast Guard crews said they had found no significant damage to ports or waterways as a result of the tsunami. ""There was no assessment of any damage in any county, which is quite remarkable,"" said Gov. Linda Lingle, who said witnesses had reported seeing ""dramatic surges going on in the ocean."" The only airport that was shut, the Hilo airport on Hawaii, reopened late in the afternoon. ""If people have a confirmed reservation they can go to the airport now and they will be able to catch their flights,"" Lingle said. The center also canceled warnings for Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Antarctica, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Pitcairn, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, French Polynesia, Mexico, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Kermadec Island, Niue, New Zealand, Tonga, American Samoa, Jarvis Island, Wallis-Futuna, Tokelau, Fiji, Australia, Palmyra Island, Pojnston Island, Marshall Island, Midway Island, Wake Island, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Howland-Baker, New Caledonia, Solomon Island, Nauru, Kosrae, Papua New Guinea, Pohnpei, Chuuk, Marcus Island, Indonesia, North Marianas, Guam, Yap, Belau, Philippines and Taiwan. Earlier, Hawaiian residents had scrambled to stock up on water, gas and food as sirens pierced the early morning quiet across the islands ahead of the tsunami. Roads to beaches and other low-lying areas were closed and seaside hotels moved guests to higher ground. Are you in Hawaii, Japan or Russia? Send your images, videos . Tsunami waves came ashore along the Chilean coast shortly after the earthquake, U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Victor Sardina told CNN. He said the largest was 9 feet near the quake's epicenter. Another wave, 7.7 feet, hit the Chilean town of Talcahuano, according to Eric Lau of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Video from the town showed one car sitting in a large expanse of water, boats littering the docks and widespread flood damage. A large wave on the island of Juan Fernandez -- 400 miles (643 km) off Chile's coast -- killed three people, Provincial Governor Ivan De La Maza said. Ten people were missing. Navigational buoys in Ventura County, California, sustained minor damage as a result of a 2-foot surge and waves, according to the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center. The Ventura County Fire Department had one report of damage to a resident's dock from the surge. In 1960, the tsunami triggered by the Chilean earthquake destroyed much of downtown Hilo and killed 61 people, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake had a magnitude between 8.25 and 8.5, the USGS said, and the waves in Hilo Bay reached 35 feet, but only 3 to 17 elsewhere.

"(CNN) -- A far-right party recorded the biggest ever share of the vote for a political party in Switzerland's history on Monday, after a controversial campaign that blamed foreigners for much of the country's crime. A Swiss People's Party supporter waves a sticker featuring the Swiss flag during Sunday's elections. The nationalist Swiss People's Party headed by Christoph Blocher rode a wave of anti-immigration sentiment to gain 29 percent of the vote. The Green Party also scored well in Sunday's vote winning 20 seats in the 200-seat National Council, Switzerland's lower house of parliament. It previously held six seats, making this the Green Party's best ever showing. The Social Democrats remain the second-largest party, despite dropping to 43 seats after gaining 19.5 percent of the vote, while the People's Party added seven extra seats, taking its total to 62. The nationalists dismissed criticism of their campaign -- derided as racist by leftist groups -- and insisted that they were only trying to address legitimate public concerns. ""Public security in Switzerland is in danger. We have a lot of foreigners committing crimes. And the Swiss people are very sensitive to that,"" Gregor Rutz, the party's Secretary General told CNN. The gains made by the nationalists will not result in radical changes to the make-up of the government, however, since Switzerland is run by a form of consensus politics. Under the Swiss system, a multi-party coalition runs the country by convention with ministers appointed from the main parties. Although the make-up of the government will stay almost unchanged, political analysts said the success of the People's Party and its hostile rhetoric reflected a growing, but worrying trend in Switzerland. ""This may be a surprise for those outside of Switzerland but not for us,"" Hans Hilter, a political scientist at Bern University, told CNN. ""This type of very negative campaigning has been a feature of previous campaigns by them (the People's Party) and reflects concerns among a wide number of people that immigration levels are too high."" Foreigners comprise a quarter of the Swiss workforce and make up around 20 percent of the population of more than 7 million. The immigrant community is dominated by Albanians, Bosnians, and Turks, though most were denied a vote in Sunday's election because of the difficulty of gaining Swiss citizenship. On the streets of this Alpine country, the polarizing campaign provoked accusations of racism against the Swiss People's Party and rioting in the capital Bern. Blocher's party was widely criticized after an ad campaign featuring a poster of a white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag. The party also called for immigrant families to be thrown out of the country if their child committed a crime. In this usually tolerant country, the hardline approach proved popular as voters unhappy at rising immigration levels handed the Swiss People's Party the best-ever election result, surpassing the Radical Democrats' victory of 28 percent of the vote in 1919. At the same time as the nationalist gains, the country elected its first black politician to the National Council, Ricardo Lumengo, who accused Blocher's party of ""scapegoating"". ""They are showing that we foreigners are responsible for everything that is bad and we found that they are just simple arguments. We condemn it,"" he told CNN. Lumengo, who came to Switzerland as an asylum seeker from Angola, added: ""It shows that in this country there is no social justice. A part of the population, they are living well, they have a good salary. But a big quantity of the population, they are living in the phenomenon of the working poor."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A woman who admitted her role in kidnapping Utah teen Elizabeth Smart in 2002 was sentenced Friday to 15 years in federal prison. Wanda Eileen Barzee, 64, apologized to the Smart family during the 30-minute sentencing in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City. ""I know the gravity of my crimes and how severe they have been, and I'm just so sorry, again, for all the pain and suffering I have caused upon the Smart family,"" Barzee said, according to court transcripts. As part of a plea deal between the defense and federal prosecutors, Judge Dale Kimball gave Barzee credit for seven years that she already has served, the U.S. attorney in Utah said. After her release, at about age 70, Barzee will be on supervised release for 60 months, federal prosecutors said. Barzee pleaded guilty in November to federal charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in Smart's kidnapping. In exchange for her guilty plea, she agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband, Brian David Mitchell, federal prosecutors said. ""The United States believes that a 15-year sentence reflects the seriousness of this offense, promotes respect for the law and provides just punishment, especially considering the defendant's past cooperation and continued willingness to cooperate in this case in the future,"" U.S. Attorney Carlie Christensen said. Smart's mother, Lois, addressed Barzee at the hearing, calling her acts unconscionable and evil. ""Wanda Barzee, what you did to our family and to our girl Elizabeth was wrong. It was wrong, and it was evil. You hurt our family in ways that you will never know. We had sleepless nights. We had endless days,"" she said. But the family has not let bitterness overtake them, she said. ""Elizabeth is doing beautiful. She's brilliant. She's bright. She is thriving, but not because you helped her in any way at all,"" Lois Smart said. ""I hope that you will be able to make peace with your maker."" Outside the courthouse, Smart's father, Ed, expressed mixed emotions over the sentence. ""It is what it is. I'm grateful that she is going to be deemed a sex offender, she's going to have to register,"" he told CNN affiliate KUTV. When pressed by a reporter as to whether the sentence was appropriate, Ed Smart sighed heavily. ""I think that Elizabeth felt that it wasn't strong enough, but to have it come to an end, it's been so many years,"" he told KUTV. Barzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in June 2002. She was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with Barzee and Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel. He had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home. The month after they kidnapped Smart, Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of Smart's cousin but were unsuccessful, prosecutors alleged. In state court in February, Barzee pleaded guilty but mentally ill to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in the attempted kidnapping of Smart's cousin. In exchange for her plea, prosecutors dropped state charges against her in Smart's abduction, Volmer said. ""Mr. Mitchell's attempt was thwarted when the minor child awakened, which caused Mr. Mitchell to flee,"" the court documents said. After her arrest in 2003, Barzee told authorities that she and Mitchell went to the home to abduct the girl and planned to hold her, along with Smart, in the couple's camp in the mountains, according to court documents. In a separate hearing in state court Friday afternoon, Barzee was sentenced to one to 15 years to be served concurrently with her federal sentence. Under Utah law, the state parole board decides how much time a defendant actually serves, Utah state courts spokeswoman Nancy Volmer said. Barzee's mother, Dora Corbett, attended the hearing, where Barzee made a similar statement to the court, Volmer said. Ed Smart also addressed the court. Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as Mitchell's. After years of being declared incompetent, she recently was declared competent to stand trial, according to the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper. A state court had ruled that she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to proceed with bringing a case against the couple, the Tribune said. At a competency hearing for Mitchell in October, Smart, now 21, testified that she had been held captive in Utah and California. Just after her abduction, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her, she said. During the nine months of her captivity, Smart testified, no 24-hour period passed without her being raped by Mitchell. In March, Kimball ruled Mitchell competent to stand trial. His federal trial is set to begin November 1. State court proceedings against him were put on hold pending the outcome of the federal case.","NEW: ""I hope that you will be able to make peace with your maker,"" Lois Smart says .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's royal family has long been taunted for its German roots, but now a more exotic lineage can be revealed after evidence emerged indicating that Prince William is the direct descendant of an Indian woman. The Duke of Cambridge's maternal lineage was revealed on Friday by a genetic ancestry testing company, BritainsDNA, which carried out tests on the DNA of Princess Diana's two matrilineal cousins and compared them to a global database of samples. Those tests reveal that the prince's fourth great-grandmother was the daughter of Eliza Kewark and Theodore Forbes (1788-1820), a Scottish merchant who worked in Surat, north of what is now Mumbai. Kewark's mitochondrial DNA -- which is only passed on from mother to child -- was then passed down, the company says, through the couple's daughter and female descendants, one of whom, Frances Roche (1936-2004), married Earl Spencer and bore a daughter, Lady Diana Spencer, the prince's mother. Jim Wilson, chief scientist at BritainsDNA, told CNN the discovery means ""William probably has a very small amount (of Indian DNA), maybe half a percent will be of South Asian heritage."" ""The mitochondrial DNA will not be passed on to the child of William and Kate,"" he added. ""But because we also did some testing on the other DNA of his cousins, we could see that they had little bits of Indian DNA across their genome, so it's quite likely that William has a few other bits of Indian DNA, and he could well pass them on to the child."" Prince William's wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, is expecting the couple's first child. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.","Prince William is the direct descendant of an Indian woman, genetic ancestry company says .

"(CNN) -- Even as it celebrates brisk sales of its new PlayStation 4, Sony is offering help to gamers experiencing problems with the next-generation gaming console. Released at midnight Friday, the PlayStation 4, or PS4, sold more than 1 million units in North America in its first 24 hours, according to Sony. But with any massive hardware rollout, some glitches are sure to surface. And the PS4 is no exception. Sony has addressed what some are calling the ""blinking blue light of death,"" an error that occurs when customers try to power up. ""Just brought home my brand new PS4 and when (I) turn it on all it does is blink blue ...,"" one user wrote on Sony's PlayStation support site. ""I am overly upset that I spent most of my day waiting in line in the cold. Not a happy customer to say the least."" Some disgruntled customers also posted one-star reviews on Amazon, although the console's average rating on that site Tuesday was a healthy four out of five stars. Sony has responded with a detailed troubleshooting guide for the problem. Sony says the complaints could be related to problems with the console's power supply, hard drive, related hardware or connection to an incompatible television. Possible fixes include updating TV software as well as revisiting a time-honored classic: turning the console off and then turning it back on again. In an earlier statement sent to media outlets, Sony had already acknowledged ""a handful of people have reported issues"" with their new console. The number of affected systems, Sony said, amounted to less than 0.4% of the units that have been shipped -- or less than 4,000 out of 1 million. ""This is within our expectations for a new product introduction, and the vast majority of PS4 feedback has been overwhelmingly positive,"" the statement said. ""We are closely monitoring for additional reports, but we think these are isolated incidents and are on track for a great launch."" The PlayStation 4 has received generally positive reviews from critics. The PS4 release was the first in a 2013 rekindling of the video-game console wars between the three big manufacturers: Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indian authorities called for calm Friday after panicked people from northeastern India fled cities across the country in fear of retaliatory attacks. Students and workers from the northeastern state of Assam say they received text messages threatening retribution for ethnic violence that has gripped their state in recent weeks. The texts prompted as many as 7,000 people to flee cities, including Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Pune and Bangalore, India's technology hub. Indian authorities banned mass text messages Friday, the Home Ministry said. For the next 15 days, Indians can no longer send more than five texts at a time. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told parliament that he did not want to assign blame but the rumors were an attack on India's unity and integrity. ""I would urge this house to send a message loud and clear to all the people of the northeast residing in different parts of the country that our people are one, that we will do everything to provide security to the people of the northeast residing in various parts of the country,"" Singh said. Assam's latest episode of violence erupted after two Muslim boys were shot July 19 by members of the indigenous Bodo tribe, according to J.N. Choudhury, the state's director general of police. Muslims retaliated by killing four Bodos. That triggered widespread rioting. Since then, police say at least 80 people have died and more than 300,000 people have been displaced. The Bodos are Bengali tribals from Bangladesh who migrated to India decades ago; many were brought by the British as laborers. Now, the Bodos fear being marginalized by the increasing number of Muslims, who have much more recently crossed the border illegally from Bangladesh, and would like to carve out a state of their own in Assam.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The woman who Jennifer Aniston, Cher, Melanie Griffith and other stars have trusted with their skin allegedly couldn't be trusted with their credit cards, according to federal authorities. Federal agents arrested Beverly Hills spa owner Gabriella Perez on charges of using her celebrity clients' credit card information to make fraudulent purchases totaling at least $280,000, according to the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. Perez, who described herself as a ""skin artist"" on her business website, was arrested without incident Wednesday afternoon, the prosecutor's office said. Chez Gabriela Studio is ""the temple of beauty"" for Beverly Hills, its website said. ""Gabriela is my favorite ass kicking facialist,"" the website quoted Cher saying. ""She is the Michelangelo of skin care!"" The criminal complaint named actress Liv Tyler as a major victim, with $214,000 in allegedly fraudulent charges made by Perez on her American Express card last year. High-end jewelry designer Loree Rodkin was the first client to alert federal investigators, the complaint said. The complaint alleges Perez ""fraudulently charged numerous times on her (Rodkin's) Visa credit card from the studio."" When Rodkin's lawyer tried to resolve the charges with Perez, she allegedly offered her $25,000 in services in exchange for the $68,000 in allegedly fraudulent charges, the complaint said. The list of victims, based on information given to investigators by Rodkin's lawyer, included Cher, Aniston, Tyler, Griffith, Anne Hathaway and Scott Speedman, the complaint said. The spa's website says its celebrity clientele also includes Halle Berry, Penelope Cruz, Amber Valletta and Mia Wasikowska.","NEW: Actress Liv Tyler was allegedly taken for $214,000 .

"(CNN) -- If you've ever been stuck for a jet lag cure, consider the experience of Singaporeans. A new survey reveals a dozen ways Singaporean travelers try to avoid the 5 p.m. shuteye, along with their success rates. Among them: Viagra, drinking alcohol and not drinking alcohol. ""Our survey has shown that people will often try various methods in order to beat jet lag -- but they may not work for everyone,"" said Singapore marketing manager Ira Noviani at travel search site Skyscanner, which conducted the poll of 1,000 travelers. The most surprising choice was taking Viagra, which 11% of those surveyed said they'd tried. Nearly half of those who said they'd tried the Viagra remedy claimed it works. According to research conducted a few years ago, jet-lagged hamsters might agree.

"Falls Church, Virginia (CNN) -- Garrulous and active, 79-year-old Joy Bricker presides over her hotel suite in a manner befitting a grander home. She offers tea to the staff and media with the ease of a person schooled in proper etiquette. Like many hotel guests, Bricker has learned to make herself feel comfortable, making her room a home away from home. Only, Bricker has called the Towne Place Suites by Marriott, in Falls Church, Virginia, home for more than 10 years. A former pilot, the 5-foot tour de force is finally turning in her key card, as movers wait to carry off the few labeled belongings she'd brought in to room 202. ""I had this chair brought up from my condo in Florida,"" says Bricker. A divider serves as a mantel for framed pictures of family, separating the kitchenette and living area of her 500-square-foot suite. She's made the hotel furniture, identical in all rooms, more personal with a blanket on a sofa and stuffed animal over a lampshade. Extended hotel stays are not so unusual, according to Carla Berberich, a general manager at the Towne Place Suites, especially for business travelers. This Virginia location is nearly half-filled, at 46 percent. But, no one has stayed as long as Bricker, who checked in on August 4, 2001. She is the longest extended-stay guest any Marriott hotel has seen. What brought Bricker here was a job with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the second politically-appointed position the onetime homemaker says she accepted. But this one came when she was 68, when many senior citizens are well settled into retirement. But, Bricker began her professional career at 50. Years of political organizing she says led to a friendship with Elizabeth and Bob Dole and ultimately to her first job during the Reagan administration in the Department of Transportation in 1981. A stint followed at the White House, where she worked in the campaign for A Drug Free America starting in 1986. For the Pennsylvania native, who spent the better part of her adult life in rural Ashland, New Hampshire, the Beltway is where she has felt most at home. The death of her husband, Glenn, from cancer gave her no pause in returning to work in 2001, which landed her at the Towne Place Suites. For less than the price of many apartment rentals in the Washington metro area (roughly $1,500-$1,700 a month) Bricker's room was supplied with wifi, which fueled her hours of daily online research and reading a day, and the added benefit of daily room cleaning, and round-the-clock security. Though she says she still makes her bed each day, though not nearly as well. Bricker has become a pillar of the transient, makeshift community. She's made friends of staff and short-term neighbors alike. Next door, her new Kuwaiti friend brings traditional meals of spiced stew for them to share. ""It's helped my appetite,"" says Bricker as she acknowledges her frail frame. ""I call it community planning,"" she adds, ""I turned it into a community."" Her daughter, Chris Winton, explains further, ""She turned them into family, and they accepted."" And, it was this family of hotel staff who came to her aid when last year a late-night fall landed her in the hospital with a broken hip. General Manager Bobby Bellinger was the first person Bricker saw when she awoke in her hospital bed. ""It ran through my mind how many people would have been this lucky,"" says Bricker as she holds Bellinger's hand on what will be a final visit together. Now, compounded ailments of osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis are forcing the fiercely independent Bricker to move in with her daughter in upstate New York. For a woman who once flew a Cherokee 180 (which she says is still in the air), she won't be grounded by this next phase of her life. She plans to devote her time to church. ""If I've set a goal, I'm going to reach it, she says."" Her goal now: ""Continue offering whatever I am able to give. I have to help. I'm not a sitter.""","Joy Bricker has lived at a Falls Church, Virginia, hotel for over a decade .

"(CNN) -- A small plane crashed while trying to land at the Aspen, Colorado, airport Sunday, killing the co-pilot and injuring two others aboard, said Alex Burchetta with the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office. Witnesses described a fiery scene as the plane flipped over and became engulfed in flames. Photos showed the plane upside down on the tarmac, its fuselage charred. The pilot of the twin-engine jet earlier reported high winds during a previous attempt to land, according to a recording of the air traffic control radio transmission obtained by CNN through Flightaware, a flight-tracking website. ""Missed approach, N115WF.Â  33 knots of tail wind,"" the pilot is heard saying a few minutes before the crash. The deceased co-pilot was identified by Burchetta as 54-year-old Sergio Carranza Brabata of Mexico. Pitkin County Coroner Dr. J. Steven Ayers listed the preliminary cause of death as blunt force trauma. The injured -- the pilot and another co-pilot flying as a passenger -- were transported to a local hospital with ""moderate to severe injuries"" as a result of the impact of the crash, Burchetta said. Aspen Valley Hospital spokeswoman Ginny Dyche told CNN the men would be transferred to another facility in Colorado to receive a higher level of treatment. The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team of investigators to the scene to begin the crash probe, NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson told CNN Sunday. Two celebrities, who were at the small airport in the Aspen ski resort area, posted Twitter messages saying they witnessed the crash. ""So sad! Horrible plane crash we just saw happen at the Aspen airport,"" singer LeAnn Rimes tweeted. Comedian Kevin Nealon tweeted: ""Horrible plane crash here at Aspen airport. Exploded into flames as it was landing. I think it was a private jet. Fire truck and ambulances were on the scene within minutes."" Burchetta said the cause of the crash is under investigation. ""Right now, we have no indication that there was anything wrong prior to landing,"" Burchetta said. FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer said the Bombardier Challenger 600 that was coming from Tucson, Arizona. The plane originated from Toluca, Mexico, roughly 40 miles west of Mexico City, according to Flightaware. The Aspen airport is known as a challenging place for pilots to land because of the mountains that surround the runway. The airport tarmac is often filled with private planes owned or chartered by the wealthy and famous who own vacation homes in the mountain resort community. ""Airport is closed now,"" Nealon tweeted.

"(CNN) -- A few decades ago, I remember grousing to a college friend that as an Asian American male, everyone I met assumed I was studying some kind of science or engineering -- as if the idea that I might want to pursue a career in the arts, humanities or communications was ridiculous. My friend responded that as a 6-foot-7 African American pre-med student, he would be ecstatic for someone to actually believe he had an interest in a STEM field, as opposed to, say, basketball. Back then, we laughed off the exchange as a sign of how the stereotype grass is always greener on the other side. Well, the fact is, stereotypes aren't quite lies; they're more like distorted versions of the truth. And the diversity statistics that the tech world's biggest firms have been shamed into releasing this year have been revealing: the numbers show that there are a heckuva lot of Asians working in America's technology industry...and very few African Americans and Latinos. According to the reports, more than four out of every 10 engineering staff in these tech companies are Asian. That includes 23% of Apple's programmers and engineers, 34% of Google's and Twitter's, 41% of Facebook's and a staggering 57% and 60% of Yahoo's and LinkedIn's respectively. By contrast -- stark, painful contrast -- around 4% of employees at these companies altogether is Hispanic and only about 3% are black. In both cases, Apple is pulling up the numbers; without the fruit company's 7% Hispanic and 6% black engineering team, the numbers would plummet. This is just embarrassing. To their credit, the tech companies understand this. Each of them revealed their numbers with sheepish blog posts that asserted the need to ""do better"" in recruiting black and Hispanic technologists. But these same posts have failed to celebrate (or even address) what would appear to be a singular diversity highlight: The very large percentages of Asians in the engineering workforce. Maybe that's because these statistics aren't exactly what they seem. The numbers released for Asian engineers have lumped U.S. citizens and permanent residents together with foreign nationals working on temporary H-1B visas; over 40% of H-1B visa holders are Asian (India alone accounts for 25%), most of them employed by tech companies. Take out the H1-B visa employees, and the eye-popping numbers of Asian technologists drops by half. There's also the reality that being an Asian technology employee can be a professional dead end. A gilded one, to be sure -- the average salary for a computer programmer is around $75,000 a year -- but the statistics on leadership-level employees show that most Asians in the tech industry hit a ceiling well before they reach management status. The percentage of whites, blacks and Hispanics who are executives is the same as their percentage in engineering roles. Asians, meanwhile, are about half as likely to be managers as they are to be coders and hardware hackers. ""I'd be lying if I said I didn't notice underrepresentation by Asians in Silicon Valley at the executive level relative to their presence at lower levels,"" said James Hong, a serial entrepreneur and angel investor who began his career at Hewlett-Packard and went on to co-found one of the early dot-com sensations, the portrait-rating site HotOrNot.com. Hong points out, however, that it's not clear whether this is more likely to be evidence of racial bias or a byproduct of immigrant culture. ""Were we on average trained as children to be overachieving bookworms who respect authority and avoid conflict, and do these traits inhibit our progression into the upper levels of management?"" he asks. ""Did strict Asian parents restrict their Asian American children from socializing with their classmates, making them incapable of leading others?"" It's a question I sometimes wonder about every time I double-clutch before raising my hand to share an opinion, or defer to a supervisor's decisions even when I disagree. (And I'm about as rash, unruly and outspoken a child of Asian immigrants as you'll probably find, as my parents have concluded.) The upbringing that gives you the skills you need to do well professionally doesn't necessarily provide you with the mindset you need to excel professionally. This suggests that the encouragement of diversity needs to be a priority in a person's life long before entry into the workforce. Ensuring that we're exposed to people of different backgrounds from a very early age doesn't just encourage tolerance; it also provides us with a rich array of cultural models to follow, helping to address the soft spots we face in our individual upbringing. It certainly did for me. I'm not sure how I would've turned out if I'd lived and grown up in a monocultural environment. I imagine I'd probably be a doctor or engineer -- a mediocre and unhappy one. The tech industry is trying to address its workforce shortcomings now, because it realizes that diversity isn't a burden, it's a secret weapon. A diverse enterprise has the wherewithal to buffer collective strengths and bridge individual weaknesses, to zig when others zag and to respond fluidly regardless of shifts in the business environment and consumer landscape. And that's even truer for America as a whole than it is for the tech industry. If the future belongs to the United States, it won't be because we invented Facebook and Google. It will be because we're the only nation in the world where Asian journalists and black doctors and Hispanic coders live and work side by side.","Jeff Yang: The diversity statistics released from tech industry are embarrassing .
Yang: While Asians do well, there are few African Americans and Hispanics .
But being an Asian technology employee can be a professional dead end, he says .

"Washington (CNN) -- An elephant never forgets, they say, especially a veteran political one like Republican Sen. John McCain. The Arizona conservative known for his hawkish views claimed a policy victory Thursday over the man who beat him in the 2008 presidential election. He took to the Senate floor to declare himself right for opposing President Barack Obama's decision to pull U.S. forces out of Iraq in 2011. ""Now we know what happens when we left Iraq. Now we know the consequences,"" McCain said. ""I hope that all those people that called me all of the names that I am not going to repeat here would render an apology because I was right! Because I said if we leave Iraq completely then, we risk the great danger of it deteriorating."" The night before, McCain tore into former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney in a live interview after Obama announced escalated military steps in Iraq and Syria to take on ISIS extremists. Their argument involved Obama's policies in Iraq and Syria during his first term, with McCain blaming the President for the current crisis and berating Carney for ""bragging"" about withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011. The exchange, with McCain repeatedly cutting Carney off and calling him a liar, came on Carney's first night as a CNN analyst. Here's a look at what they said: . 1) McCain said Obama rejected calls by his entire national security team to arm Syrian rebels . This is partly true. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others in the administration wanted to send weapons and other aid to Syrian opposition groups considered moderate to bolster their fight against government forces of President Bashar al-Assad. However, some voices inside and out of the administration opposed such a move, arguing that extremist elements in the opposition, including al Qaeda affiliates, could wind up with the U.S. hardware. At the time, McCain and fellow war hawks pushed loudly for arming the Syrian rebels and criticized Obama for deciding against it. On Wednesday night, McCain took umbrage with Carney's assertion that the Syrian opposition was too informal and splintered to pick partners for aid back in 2012. Asked by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper about Obama's speech, McCain quickly veered off to attack Carney. ""By the way, I'm astounded that Mr. Carney should say that the Free Syrian Army is now stronger. In fact, they have been badly damaged,"" McCain said. When Carney replied that he had merely noted the United States now had more information on the rebels, McCain shot back: ""Come on, Jay, we knew all about them then. You just didn't choose to know."" ""Your boss, when the entire national security team wanted to arm and train them, he turned them down, Mr. Carney,"" McCain continued. Carney interjected that the two should ""agree to disagree on this,"" but McCain kept going, asserting Obama made ""the unilateral decision"" to turn down ""the entire national security team."" 2) McCain said Obama's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq led to the current crisis . The withdrawal contributed to conditions that resulted in ISIS fighters rampaging through northern Iraq from Syria, but other factors also played a role. For example, critics accused former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of consolidating power and persecuting political rivals, blaming him for fueling Iraq's problems with sectarian policies that alienated Sunni Muslims. McCain's main point was that Obama brought home all the U.S. troops instead of leaving a residual force of at least several thousand to help maintain stability. ""The fact he didn't leave a residual force in Iraq, overruling all of his military advisers, is the reason we're facing ISIS today,"" said the senator. While military leaders called for keeping a limited U.S. contingent in Iraq, the Obama administration needed a security agreement with the Iraqi government to do so. No such agreement emerged, and Carney said the result was fulfillment of withdrawal plans dating back to the previous administration of Republican President George W. Bush. ""You are again saying facts that are patently false,"" McCain responded, arguing the Iraqis wanted a residual U.S. deployment but Obama never supported such a result. ""And you in your role as a spokesperson bragged about the fact that the last American combat troop had left Iraq,"" he continued. ""If we had left a residual force, the situation would not be what it is today."" Carney responded that McCain presented ""facts that you believe are true based on the argument that you have made for a long time, sir, that we should leave troops in Iraq in perpetuity."" ""That is just not what this President believes,"" Carney said. ""Obviously he was elected President to fulfill what he believed was right for our country and right for our national security."" McCain repeatedly cut him off and accused him of distortion. When Carney said he understood that McCain disagreed, the senator shot back: ""It is not a matter of disagreement. It is a matter of facts. And you have yours wrong and you have distorted."" Democratic candidates finding distance from Obama on ISIS . Kerry: U.S. not at war with ISIS .","Sen.

Darryl McCauley, who was Cook's business manager from the early 1990s until 1998, pleaded guilty to larceny, embezzlement and forgery charges in October. His wife, Erika McCauley, pleaded guilty to larceny charges. ""For several years, Mr. McCauley abused his position as a family member to gain Mr. Cook's trust, and stole millions of dollars for his own personal gain,"" Attorney General Martha Coakley said after his sentencing.

"(CNN) -- Severe flooding from an intense monsoon season has left more than 250 people dead and hundreds more homeless across parts of South Asia and China. Dozens more have been injured or are missing. In Pakistan, flash flooding has killed 110 people and injured nearly 150 others in recent days, authorities said Saturday. India also is coping with severe flooding, which has claimed the lives of at least 97 people in Indian-administered Kashmir, Vinod Koul, state relief and rehabilitation commissioner, told CNN on Saturday. And in southwestern China, more than 40 people have died and 18 others are missing after heavy rains and flooding over the past week, authorities said. The hardest-hit areas in Pakistan include Punjab, the country's most populous province, and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Lahore and Rawalpindi, major cities in Punjab, are experiencing serious flooding. The flooding has destroyed 650 homes in Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's office said. The Pakistani government reported Friday that up to a foot of rain had fallen in eastern parts of the country within the past day. Some flood victims died from collapsing roofs or electrocution by downed power lines, officials said. Sharif will attend a meeting Saturday to review the ""situation in the country and damage caused to life and property by incessant rains and resulting floods,"" a statement said. In India, more than 2,000 villages have been affected in the Kashmir and Jammu region, Koul said. The severe flooding has also damaged or completely washed away dozens of bridges and hundreds of kilometers of road, he added. Power and water systems have been crippled by the monsoons as well. Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday toured the devastated area near the state capital of Srinagar, assuring residents that relief is on the way. The state government has undertaken a massive rescue and relief operation, but residents have complained of inadequate or delayed responses from authorities in the hardest-hit areas. The Indian army is also taking part in the rescue and relief operation. Some 5,000 people have been rescued from the flood zone as of Saturday, according to the Ministry of Defence. The agency also said the army had rescued seven of nine soldiers trapped by floodwaters after their boat capsized south of Srinagar. Efforts to rescue two more personnel were under way Saturday. CNN-IBN reported the area is experiencing the worst flooding in six decades. In China, heavy rain has so far claimed the lives of 43 people over the past week, the country's Civil Affairs Ministry reported Sunday morning. Damage estimates have exceeded 3.3 billion yuan (more than $530 million). In Thailand, the state-run MCOT news agency reported that authorities urged residents along waterways in the country's central region to move to higher ground. The risk of flooding increased there after a decision to release more water from a dam to reduce water levels in the flood-hit north, MCOT reported. Heavy rains also caused extensive flooding in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, South Korea and Japan last month. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Mukhtar Ahmad, Michael Pearson, Kevin Wang and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","NEW: Ministry: 43 die due to flooding over the past week .

"Washington (CNN) -- The suspect in Wednesday's shooting of a building manager at the headquarters of a conservative Christian group was charged Thursday with assault with intent to kill, ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation and held without bond. In his initial appearance in U.S. District Court, Floyd Lee Corkins II, 28, also was charged with interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition. The assault charge is a District of Columbia offense that carries a maximum 30-year sentence. The federal firearms charge carries a 10-year maximum sentence. At about 11 a.m., Corkins entered the Washington office of the Family Research Council, where he encountered the building manager, Leo Johnson, at the front door, according to a criminal complaint that cited a witness. Corkins ""stated words to the effect of, 'I don't like your politics,' "" the witness told FBI agents, according to the complaint. Surveillance video shows that Corkins took a firearm from his backpack and shot Johnson in the arm, at which point the wounded Johnson ""wrestled the firearm away from Corkins, and subdued him,"" according to the complaint. Corkins, who was wearing a white plastic jumpsuit during Thursday's court appearance, was ordered to remain in custody pending a prelimary and detention hearing on August 24. His right eye was red and appeared swollen. Magistrate Judge Alan Kay appointed a public defender after Corkins told him he had only $300 and could not afford to hire his own lawyer. A law enforcement official told CNN that initial evidence indicated Corkins was acting alone. Officials recovered a loaded Sig Sauer 9mm pistol and two additional loaded 9mm magazines, according to the complaint. Inside the backpack, police found 50 rounds of 9mm ammunition and 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches, the complaint says. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the Chick-fil-A company gave the Family Research Council $1,000 ""a number of years ago"" but does not underwrite his group. And the Family Research Council, which which focuses on family and anti-abortion issues and religious liberties, supported Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy after he said in an interview published last month that his company is ""a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that."" The statement sparked an uproar, with activists saying that Cathy voiced opposition to gay marriages. ""The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect -- regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender,"" the company says in a posting on its website. Corkins ""has strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner,"" authorities said in the complaint, citing information from the suspect's parents, with whom he lives in Herndon, Virginia, outside Washington. In an interview with CNN affiliate WJLA, Johnson said Corkins told him he was there to interview for an internship, then shot him without warning. Johnson said it was after he had wrestled Corkins to the ground that the suspect told him the shooting was about the group's policies, according to WJLA. Authorities found what appeared to be an open gun box on the seat of his car, which had been parked at the East Falls Church Metro station, according to the complaint. Corkins legally purchased the handgun from a gun shop in Virginia within the last week, according to a law enforcement official. Corkins had volunteered at the DC Center for the LGBT Community, a source working with the center told CNN. The group provides services and support to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, . He received a master's degree from George Mason University's College of Education and Human Development in 2006, the university said. Family Research Council President Perkins told reporters Thursday that Johnson has a secondary role as a security guard, but that he was unarmed and did not wear a uniform. Perkins said that he was with the wounded building operations manager when the man came out of surgery about midnight. ""I said, 'Leo, I want you to know that you're a hero.' "" ""He said, 'Wow, this hero business is hard work.' So, he did not lose his sense of humor."" Perkins predicted Johnson would return to work soon. Warning signs of violence: What to do . While D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier and others have hailed Johnson as a hero, WJLA reported the 46-year-old told the station in a telephone interview that he was simply doing his job and is not comfortable being described as a hero. He told the station that Corkins spoke with him after he was apprehended. ""He said it wasn't about me,"" Johnson said. ""It was about the organization.""

"(CNN) -- In many ways, the critically acclaimed film ""Precious"" is about hopes and dreams. When Mo'Nique, one of the movie's stars, was growing up in Baltimore, Maryland, she too longed for something. ""I've always wanted to be famous,"" the actress and comedian said. ""I enjoyed watching famous people and so I wanted to be that. I just wasn't sure how I was going to do it."" ""It wasn't until I saw this woman named Oprah Winfrey doing this show called 'People Are Talking' [a local talk show Winfrey co-hosted while she was at Baltimore's WJZ-TV] that I said 'That is what I want to do right there.' "" Mo'Nique has achieved that dream -- she's now hosting a late-night talk show on Black Entertainment Television -- and so much more. With her portrayal of an abusive mother in ""Precious,"" the singularly named entertainer is burning brightly in Hollywood these days. She's been nominated for both a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her film performance, singled out as one of People magazine's most intriguing persons of 2009 and won a Special Jury Prize for Acting at the Sundance Film Festival. With all of the accolades and the many critics who have hailed her performance, it's only natural that people are excited about the possibility of an Academy Award nomination . Everyone it seems, except for Mo'Nique. She talked to CNN about why she's taking it one day at a time, her influence as a plus-sized role model and why she's never met a curse word she didn't like. CNN: It seems like people can't stop talking about you and awards, especially the big one, yet you seem decidedly low key about it. Why is that? Mo'Nique: I'm very appreciative of it, but I can't let it drive me crazy. It's a part of the process but I can't go crazy with it because I'm also a wife and a mother, a talk show host and a stand-up comic. God willing if it happens, it happens and if it doesn't, I understand. CNN: Now that you are famous, is it all that you imagined? Mo'Nique: Baby, when I tell you it is all that I thought it would be and then things I couldn't even imagine. If I say what I have done in my career, you almost want to say ""Girl stop lying!"" CNN: Years ago, you said your co-star on the television show ""The Parkers,"" Dorien Wilson, expressed some concerns about your acting ability. Now with all of the praise you are getting as an actress, what do you have to say to that? Mo'Nique: (Laughing) He did say that! He said, ""She needs some work."" I am going to have to remind him of that the next time I talk to him. CNN: How have you worked on your craft as an actress? Mo'Nique: Just experiencing and enjoying life. For me, I love to entertain, but I love being honest while entertaining. When I played Nikki Parker on ""The Parkers,"" I loved that woman and she was very honest. You just have to be right there in the moment. CNN: What, if anything, did you love about the Mary Jones, the character of the mother in ""Precious""? Mo'Nique: What I loved about Mary is that she was open, she let you see it and she was vulnerable. And in the end she was crying out for help. When you watch Mary throughout that film she was a monster until that very last scene. She became human. For as cruel as she was, she let you know that she was human and that she was sick. CNN: You have been open about the sexual abuse you said you suffered as a child at the hands of a family member. Did those memories make it difficult to go there with this role? Mo'Nique: It wasn't difficult at all because I had already dealt with it. I had already gone through therapy. When Mr. [Lee] Daniels [the film's director] called me for the role I was excited. I thought, ""Oh good, this story is going to get told. It's not going to get swept under the rug anymore."" I knew Mary Jones, I knew that character. So when Mr. Daniels said ""Action,"" I wanted to bring as much honesty as I could so people know that this is real. Like she really exists and it can be you. That's why I say I don't focus on the awards because we have already won because this movie is changing lives. I had an Asian brother come up to me after a screening in Los Angeles. We were all standing outside in the lobby and the way he was approaching had everyone a little uneasy. He came over to me and he said ""What I am about to say to you is going to sound a little weird, but I am Mary Jones. I was Mary Jones to my little brother and my sister."" We were embracing and he's crying and I said ""Congratulations brother. Now go get yourself some help."" CNN: On a lighter note, your late-night talk show on BET doesn't even seem like you are working. It seems like you are out there playing. Mo'Nique: Baby, I am having so much fun! We promised ourselves that it would be a party. The way the world is right now, not just America, but the world, we feel like people want to feel good when they go to bed at night. They want to feel like tomorrow is going to be all right. With the music, the dancing, the audience, the guests, I am having my own little party out there. CNN: You look great doing it. How have you lost so much weight? Mo'Nique: I made a commitment to working out, but it is very challenging to watch what I put in my mouth. The main reason I did it was because of my children [4-year-old twins and a teenaged son]. I want to meet their children and so I have to show the universe I am willing to put in the work to be able to meet future generations if I am allowed. CNN: You have been such an inspiration to plus-sized women. Do you worry about losing that demographic as you slim down? Mo'Nique: I don't. Right now I fluctuate between 217 and 222 and I would like to get to an even 200. I don't worry about losing my fluffy sisters because I am excited about sharing the news. I'm excited to say, ""Listen, we are big women and we are going to be big women until we leave here, but let's be big, healthy, curvaceous women."" For me, when I was 262 pounds, just for me, I didn't want anybody cutting on me, sucking stuff out, stapling me or any of that. I wanted to make the commitment and put the work in. I might not make it to 200 for another two years, but I ain't worried about it. I'm still going to put the work in. CNN: Do you miss doing stand-up? Mo'Nique: Please! I haven't stopped doing stand-up. They are trying to put the tour schedule together right now. My husband, who is the executive producer for the talk show, says ""You need that"" and I get about six minutes of it with the show. But sometimes I find myself wanting to go to the left on them and I have to hold back and say ""Wait, I know someone from the FCC is watching."" CNN: Yeah, how do you tone that down for television because, based on your stand-up routines, you clearly like to cuss. Mo'Nique: (Laughing) Cussing is great! It is beautiful. It's a stress reliever. It keeps your blood pressure down. Ain't nothing wrong with cussing. I come from a family of cussers, baby. Listen, growing up, my aunts and uncles, you would go over their house to play spades and there would be some cussing going on and you'd have to say ""I didn't even know you could put those words together!"" But the way my aunt did it, it was like she was singing to me. I would say to myself ""God, when I get grown, watch out!""","Mo'Nique critically acclaimed for role as abusive mother in the film ""Precious""

"(CNN) -- It is 5:00am on Sunday morning in Austin, Texas. Dawn has yet to break here but preparations are already under way for the afternoon's Formula One race. A golden glow of light pools from a hair salon in the west of the city; inside the COTA girls -- named after the Circuit of the Americas track where the U.S. Grand Prix is staged - are being preened and coiffed for their big day. The young women share the grid with some of the sport's biggest names but while Red Bull's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel was still getting his beauty sleep the COTA girls are already at work. ""I've been waking up at about four o'clock in the morning,"" explains Amanda Bingman, a first time COTA girl and the troop's only redhead. ""The drivers probably get to sleep in and wait for their crew to get their stuff together. ""But it's worth it -- beauty is pain!"" There is a happy chatter at this pre-dawn pampering party for the 31 young women selected to be COTA girls for the 2013 U.S. Grand Prix. Center stage . Despite the early start, the overwhelming feeling is one of excitement at sharing center stage at a prestigious international event that is watched by half a billion viewers around the globe. ""What's it like being a grid girl?"" 24-year-old Krystal Malloy, who is a photographer by trade, ponders. ""Get ready for an almost paparazzi style feel to it! You walk out and you instantly have cameras taking pictures of you and video cameras filming you. ""You're just 'wow, this is amazing!' You feel the energy of the people, the crowd and how excited they are. It's a wonderful feeling to be part of this."" Grid girls -- also known as paddock girls or brolly dollies -- have been part of motorsport's glamorous panoply for the last 40 years. Sponsor driven . They arrived in Formula One following the advent of sponsorship and advertising in the late 1960s and soon became a popular promotional asset for the sport. Their duties include displaying the race number placards on the grid, clapping the drivers onto the podium, making appearances in VIP suites and taking part in photo sessions with the fans. The girls are not allowed to talk to the drivers unless they are spoken to first and there's an even stricter rule imposed by the COTA girls' manager Kristen Ditto, a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader. ""One of my very, very strict policies is that in a non-working situation the girls may not interact with the race car drivers,"" Ditto explained to CNN. ""However, in a working situation they have to be cordial and that's it."" COTA girl Grace Kim illuminates further: ""Last year I was the grid girl for Michael Schumacher. I think he said hello - but he was getting in the zone."" Do the young women see themselves as playing the glamorous figures in a man's world? Tough selection . ""No, not at all,"" says Malloy. ""We are very well versed. We went through a series of interviews before we even got this job. ""We have no problem conversing with people and being personable instead of just standing there and looking pretty as a picture."" Ditto and the circuit's marketing manager Rodrigo Sanchez are intent on cultivating a sense of empowerment within their brood of COTA girls. Good looks are only part of the selection criteria. The applicants -- there were 250 this season with some even applying from Europe and Australia -- go through a three-stage interview process. ""I actually got asked how much I could bench press in my interview,"" laughs Ashley Elgie, a sports trainer, saleswoman and architect -- as well as a repeat COTA girl. Ditto jokes that she plays the role of picky X Factor USA judge Simon Cowell on the selection panel. Cross section . She is looking for well-rounded young women who can represent the modern American sweetheart in F1's global community. ""We have the cross section of the American woman,"" Ditto, an attractive blond, explains. ""I'm not looking for a stereotypical, 5""10 blonde model. We have Asian, Latino, African-American girls. We're not looking for a maximum age, we actually have one COTA girl who is 38. ""It's not just about the looks department either, it's a lot more than that. We are looking for the all-American woman who is poised, attractive and confident, a great communicator and who can be a COTA ambassador."" Although the role of a COTA girl comes with a salary and a year-long contract, the women also hold down full-time jobs or are in college. Learning curve . Being a COTA girl is an exciting break from the norm but for some it is also a useful learning curve. ""I'm in school right now for radio and television,"" explains Jordan Hannah, a 19-year-old from Dallas. ""I want to be a sports reporter or an anchor woman so this is really good for me. ""It teaches me how to handle myself in environments when I might feel overwhelmed, how to communicate with people from different parts of the world. ""It gives me a feel of what I might be doing if I am a sports reporter one day."" Ditto hopes that the experience of being a COTA girl will, above all, be a stepping-stone for the young women in their future careers. ""Coming from the Dallas Cowboys taught me a lot,"" she adds. ""It gave me the background that I need to pass on to these girls and get them ready for life skills, not just here at the track. Eye candy? ""I want them to hold themselves high and be confident because self confidence is the key to everything."" The experience of being a COTA girl may well be empowering but that does not stop everyone from viewing them as eye candy. The girls concede attention from arduous admirers comes with the territory. ""Yes, it happens,"" says Elgie. ""We're always very polite but also very modest about the situation and just keep moving on... 'Thank for the compliment, that's very nice of you to say.'"" Ditto is also on hand to make sure the girls are not put in any situations they do not feel comfortable with. ""The girls are always being hit on,"" she says. ""It's just the nature of the beast but we want them to be at ease with everything that they do. ""If I walk in the door and it's all alcohol, all men; a bunch of people just carrying on, I probably will just skip that suite or I'll just tell the girls 'just keep a smile on your face, say hello and we'll quickly excuse ourselves.' ""I have to be the bad cop. If the environment goes sour then we quickly assess the situation and get out of there."" American sweetheart . It may be less than sweet but for now being an American sweetheart is not a job for the boys. Grid boys have made rare appearances in F1, for example at the European Grand Prix in Valencia, but there are no plans for cowboys to giddy up on the Texan grid. ""I haven't had any [men] apply,"" says Ditto, when asked why there aren't any COTA boys. ""I don't think it's sexist but I have to be really, really careful because that's a good question. ""I would say in different parts of the world that would be totally acceptable, I just can't see that being welcomed here because we are so used to seeing beautiful Texas women. I think it's cultural for sure."" Tom-boy girls . Kim, who is also the circuit's official DJ, has her own theory: ""We're kind of tom-boy girls."" Elgie agrees: ""We recently worked at an event where we were able to race go-karts round the track. ""I was so mad because I was in first place for the longest time and then I got passed by some man at the end. I was so ticked off, I got second place."" So, the COTA girls definitely do not see themselves as second best in a man's world? ""Never!"" exclaims Kim. ""We're always representing girl power."" Girl power just needs a little extra preening and with that it is back to business at the early bird hair salon to ""fluff and puff"" their Texas style.","Grid girls share the tarmac with the stars of F1 .
Work long hours and have to abide by strict rules .
Over 250 applicants for the job from all over the world .

"(CNN) -- Trail Life USA, the group that was launched after the Boys Scouts voted to allow gay members, held its inaugural convention over the weekend in Nashville. More than 1,000 people attended, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. The group, which will officially launch in 2014, says it expects to become a ""premier"" Christian organization for boys and young men. At the weekend event, which reporters were not allowed to attend, the group unveiled its name and logo. The logo includes the words adventure, character and leadership. ""Trail Life USA will be inclusive of boys, regardless of religion, race, national origin or socioeconomic status, and accept boys who are experiencing same-sex attractions or gender confusion,"" a statement from the group says. ""However, it will not admit youth who are open or avowed about their homosexuality, and it will not admit boys who are not 'biologically male' or boys who wish to dress and act like girls."" Boy Scout vote . In May, more than 60% of 1,400-member national council of the BSA voted to allow openly gay youths to join scouting. The change takes effect January 1. The BSA, however, will maintain its ban on gay adult leaders. The National Jewish Committee on Scouting, the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church, the Unitarian Universalist Association and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which sponsors more Scout units than any other faith, all endorsed the change. Faith-based organizations charter more than 70% of Scout chapters, providing meeting space and leadership, according to the BSA. ""There have been some organizations that have decided not to renew their charters with Scouting,"" BSA spokesman Deron Smith said in May. ""But we can't quantify the impact of the amended policy."" Not anti-BSA . Despite its Genesis, Trail Life USA says it's not ""anti-BSA,"" nor its name is meant to be ""political or controversial."" The theme of the weekend conference was: ""Honoring the Legacy, Raising the Standard."" Yet, the group is clear on the stand it's taking. ""Our whole life is about the trail, both in the outdoors and in the journey of life as believers,"" said John Stemberger, chairman of the board for the organization, and also founder of On My Honor, a group that opposed the Scout's change in policy. ""So Trail Life is a way of life that is centered on following Christ in the outdoors.""","More than 1,000 attend group's inaugural national convention .

"(CNN) -- David Frum is one of today's best and most reasoned conservative political voices, so his recent CNN.com op-ed on marijuana policy was just a little disappointing. Not because he advocates the drug's decriminalization -- he rightly thinks locking people up or arresting them for casual use is a bad idea -- but because he opposes its legalization for adults. I agree with much of what he says about pot's potential harm, especially for the young and the psychiatrically ill. Like Frum, I am a father who worries about my kids getting sidetracked by cannabis before their brains have a chance to develop. But I am also a physician who understands that the negative legal consequences of marijuana use are far worse than the medical consequences. Frum would reduce the punishment for marijuana use for adults but nominally maintain its illegality in order to send a message to young people that pot is a ""bad choice,"" as if breaking the rules wasn't as much an incentive as a deterrent for adolescents. Kids are smart enough to recognize and dismiss a ""because I said so"" argument when they see one. By trying to hide marijuana from innately curious young people, we have elevated its status to that of a forbidden fruit. I believe a better approach is to bring pot into the open, make it legal for people over the age of 21, and educate children from a young age about the actual dangers of its recreational use. Opinion: War on drugs a trillion-dollar failure . Throughout my career as a clinical psychiatrist, I have seen lives ruined by drugs like cocaine, painkillers and alcohol. I have also borne witness to the devastation brought upon cannabis users -- almost never by abuse of the drug, but by a justice system that chooses a sledgehammer to kill a weed. Alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, caffeine and refined sugar are among the most commonly used, potentially habit-forming recreational substances. All are best left out of our daily diets. Only marijuana is illegal, though alcohol and tobacco are clearly more harmful. In several respects, even sugar poses more of a threat to our nation's health than pot. I agree with Frum that chronic use of cannabis correlates with mood changes and low motivation, especially when started in adolescence. In individuals with psychosis, it may trigger or worsen their symptoms. But these dangers are far surpassed by the perils of alcohol, which is associated with pancreatitis, gastritis, cirrhosis, permanent dementia, physiological dependence and fatal withdrawal. In healthy but reckless teens and young adults, it is frighteningly easy to consume a lethal dose of alcohol, but it is essentially impossible to do so with marijuana. Further, alcohol causes severe impairment of judgment, which results in violence, risky sexual behavior and more use of hard drugs. Those who believe cannabis to be a gateway to opioids and other highly dangerous drugs fail to appreciate that the illegal purchase of marijuana exposes consumers to dealers who push the hard stuff. Given marijuana's popularity in this country, the consumption of more dangerous drugs could actually decrease if pot were purchased at a liquor store rather than on the street corner where heroin and crack are sold. Opinion: Legalize pot? No, reform laws . There is another more pressing reason to legalize and regulate marijuana, even for the sake of our children: the potential for adulteration of black-market cannabis and the substitution of even more dangerous copycat compounds. Much like Prohibition-era fatalities from bad moonshine, harmful synthetic marijuana substitutes are proliferating, with street names like K2 and Spice. The Drug Enforcement Administration struggles to combat these compounds by outlawing them, but I see no decrease in their popularity among my patients. Natural marijuana poses much less danger than synthetic cannabinoids -- legal or otherwise. So who had the bright idea of banning cannabis in the first place? Was it physicians? Social service organizations? No. The credit goes to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, which in 1937 pushed through laws ending the growth, trade and consumption of all forms of cannabis, including the inert but commercially useful hemp plant. America's ban on the so-called ""Weed of Madness"" was based on bad science and fabricated stories of violence perpetrated under the influence. The madness of cannabis can be ascribed not so much to its users, but to those who sought to criminalize the drug so soon after the monumental failure of alcohol Prohibition. That's not to say our marijuana laws have failed to change drug use in America. Cannabis is more widely used today than at any time before its prohibition, even though it was domesticated in antiquity and has been cultivated ever since. Pot prohibition has also greatly increased illegal activity and violence. Otherwise law-abiding private users became criminals, and criminals became rich through the untaxed, bloody and highly lucrative illicit drug trade. Opinion: The end of the war on marijuana . But America can fix this mess through marijuana legalization. Federal, state and local governments can regulate the cannabis trade as they do with alcohol and tobacco -- monitoring the production process for safety and purity, controlling where it is sold, taxing all aspects of marijuana production and consumption, and redirecting resources from punishment to prevention. Forget the antiquated dogma and judge pot prohibition on its own merits. If you still believe that cannabis should be illegal, then you must logically support the criminalization of alcohol and tobacco, with vigorous prosecution and even imprisonment of producers and consumers. Does that sound ridiculous? Then you must conclude that the only rational approach to cannabis is to legalize, regulate and tax it. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of David Nathan.","David Nathan disputes CNN op-ed by David Frum that argues pot should be illegal .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- As the immigration debate moves to the House of Representatives, Americans are fully engaged. Is it too much to ask that they also be fully informed? Not many are. They have strong opinions on a subject they don't really understand. They know what they believe, but they long ago stopped asking themselves why they believe it. Worst of all, as bad as the immigration problem is, some of the solutions they propose range from the nonworkable to the nonsensical. One proposed remedy sticks out as the nuttiest of all. In fact, if you love this country, it's actually quite offensive. Consider the interaction I had recently with a friend who follows politics. The son of a Pennsylvania coal miner and a graduate of Yale Law School and Oxford University, my buddy wanted to put in his two cents about immigration -- and how to fix a broken system. A moderate Republican, he doesn't support the bill that the Senate passed by a vote of 68-32, and he is looking for something better. He doesn't mind the idea of legalizing at least some of the undocumented, but he wants the United States to secure the border first. He's reasonable, but this issue troubles him -- and so do some of the proposed remedies. As for his solution, my friend blurted out: ""Why don't we just do whatever Mexico does? I mean, they must be doing a good job of keeping out illegal immigrants. Why not adopt their policies?"" Ay Chihuahua. Not this again. I hear this argument, or variations of it, at least three times a week from readers. I've heard it from audiences when I give speeches. I've heard it from callers when I host radio shows. It's either someone's idea of a joke or what some people consider a major breakthrough. Here's the back story. Accounts in the media over the last several years have detailed how badly Mexico treats immigrants from Central America who try to enter illegally through its southern border on their way to the United States. The border is often fortified, and the trip can be dangerous. Mexican immigration officials sometimes look the other way and let the migrants cross the Mexico-Guatemala border because they assume that they're only passing through on their way to the United States. But when there is the chance that the Central Americans might stick around and find work in Mexico, attitudes harden -- both on the border and in Mexican society at large. And the standards for becoming a citizen and punishments for infractions are much harsher than those in the U.S. How's that for irony? It seems that Mexicans are no more keen on losing jobs to Guatemalans, Hondurans or Salvadorans than Americans are about losing them to Mexicans. It goes to show that people are the same all around the world. There is no denying the hypocrisy of Mexicans who insist on a secure border to the south but would prefer a porous one to the north. On trips to Mexico City to meet with government officials, I've raised that issue. But that doesn't let Americans off the hook for the role they play in this drama. U.S. employers willingly and eagerly hire immigrants from Mexico -- and Central America -- to do jobs that Americans won't do. The American household has never been more dependent on illegal immigrant labor that provides middle-class Americans with nannies, gardeners, housekeepers, senior caregivers and all the other comforts of what used to be an upper-middle-class lifestyle. Should the United States aspire to be like Mexico? Is that really the solution to our immigration woes? Sure. Let's do that. It's worked out really well for Mexico over the past century or so. We're talking about a country that people try to escape, where opportunity is scarce and where the population is divided six ways from Sunday -- rich vs. poor, country folks vs. city dwellers, light skinned vs. dark skinned, the educated elite vs. the poor illiterates who serve them. We're talking about a country where people routinely prey on one another, and where many of them seem to think that they can't have anything unless they take it from someone else. We're talking about a country that takes in about $25 billion a year in remittances from expatriates living in the United States, and has no real national economic policy beyond that and tourism. We're talking about a country, parts of which remain mired in the Third World and an economy that -- while it has shown new vibrancy in recent years -- remains second-rate, and where immigration is kept to a minimum and where foreign investment in key industries such as petroleum is restricted. And last, we're talking about a country that remains plagued by nativism and racism toward immigrants who are considered inferior to the native-born. Is that a model worth emulating? Should we be like Mexico? No, thank you. Not on your life. Not for this Mexican-American. About 100 years ago, my grandfather, and his parents, chose the United States over Mexico because it was a superior country. During the Mexican Revolution, this was thought to be a safer country with more freedom and opportunity. That is still the case. Now some of my fellow Americans want me to, in essence, choose Mexico over the United States, as if our neighbor could teach us how to behave toward immigrants. Sure, we Americans have our problems. And our immigration system is broken. But, believe it or not, it is still the envy of the world. Immigration is one thing we do right. Let's remember that. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette hears some nonsensical solutions to the U.S. immigration problem .

"(CNN) -- Comedian Adam Carolla settled a lawsuit Tuesday filed by a former friend of 30 years who claimed he had been cheated out of his share of Carolla's popular podcast. Donny Misraje, a television editor and producer, had sought $4.5 million in damages from Carolla, his friend since their high school days in suburban Los Angeles. Misraje claimed to be the creative force behind Carolla's podcast and contended he was promised 30% of the company. Carolla completed his testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday; Misraje testified last week and the case was winding to a close. Terms of the settlement were confidential. ""It was a good deal for my side and a smart deal for his side,"" said Misraje's lawyer, Greg Doll. The deal was reached after the judge issued a ruling that limited Misraje's claim for damages from 2009 to 2012, the year Carolla fired him. Misraje had sought a share of the podcast profits until 2017. Carolla's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the ruling caused the plaintiffs to blink. ""After Adam's compelling testimony yesterday and Judge (Michael) Johnson's ruling today gutting their expert's damage theory, apparently they finally woke up to the fact that their case was disintegrating before their very eyes,"" said Geragos, who also is a legal analyst for CNN. Doll said several jurors told him they were leaning toward Misraje. The only question they had, he added, was how high the damage award should be. The case told the story of the unraveling of a decades-long friendship between ""Ace"" Carolla and ""The Weez"" Misraje that began during the 1980s at North Hollywood High School. Carolla was a frequent visitor at the Misrajes' home, often helping himself to food in the family refrigerator. When their other friends went away to college, the two rented an apartment and worked odd jobs. They rehabbed a 1964 Cadillac limousine, which they drove to clubs and parties, ""Entourage""-style. The saga of 'Ace' and 'The Weez' Carolla, now 50, eventually found his niche at a Los Angeles FM radio station, KROQ, and Misraje worked at several network and syndicated television productions, including ""The Tonight Show With Jay Leno."" He now works as a producer at ""The Queen Latifah Show."" Misraje claimed he came up with the idea for Carolla to launch his podcast in 2009 when he lost his L.A. morning radio show on CBS station KLSX. He claimed he was promised a cut of the business in a ""handshake deal"" but never got it in writing. He told the jury that, based on his friend's word, he walked away from his $231,000-a-year job, took out a second mortgage on his home and encouraged his wife and cousin to join the business even though they might not see an immediate payday. The reason: Carolla was still bound to his CBS contract, which included a noncompete clause that kept them from soliciting revenue for the podcast during its first year. Once the podcast started making money, Misraje contended, Carolla pushed him and the others out of the business. Carolla, Geragos says, always maintained Misraje wasn't the only person who encouraged him to start a podcast. Carolla called Misraje a ""partner"" to humor him and honor their longstanding friendship, the lawyer said. Carolla's popular podcast became the record holder, surpassing British comedian Ricky Gervais with nearly 60 million unique downloads between March 2009 and March 2011, according to Guinness World Records.","A settlement is reached during Adam Carolla podcast trial .

"(CNN) -- The Founding Fathers are frequently quoted in the gun control debate, but many of those quotations turn out to be fake. The most popular comment on a recent story about gun control featured a purported quotation from Thomas Jefferson. More than 2,000 votes pushed it to the top. ""When governments fear the people, there is liberty,"" reads the quotation. ""When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."" The same quotation has been posted dozens of times in other readers' posts. Some readers worked to debunk it by mentioning Monticello.org, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation's website, which has a section devoted to ""spurious"" quotations that have been attributed to the third president of the United States. The website lists several variations of the quotation, featured on two pages, and says staff ""have not found any evidence that Thomas Jefferson said or wrote"" those words. Former Marines share dramatically different stances on gun violence . Duane Tigner, a commenter who said he teaches American government to high school students in Sanford, Michigan, described feeling a responsibility to educate young people about the need to develop a discerning eye about the information they come across. Tigner was one of the readers who mentioned that the quotation had been debunked. He suggests starting with a Google search, which often will quickly turn up information about a quotation. ""Many of these quotations are circulated and reposted on social media or appear in chain e-mails,"" he said via e-mail. ""Every time I see one of these bogus quotes, I call it out as fake."" For others, the message of the quotation rings true even if the quotation isn't entirely accurate. A commenter named Henry from Charlotte, North Carolina, said he read through the Monticello page, but he isn't ready to declare that the comment is fake. ""I do not know if Jefferson actually ever made such a statement or not, (but) I find it odd that many people attribute it to him if it wasn't true. It's ridiculous in my opinion to propose that since nowhere in his writings there is trace of such a statement, then Jefferson has never said something like that. Jefferson could have come up with those words in any occasion of his public or private life and someone else recorded and then quoted him."" CNN decided to look at the reasons why apparently fake quotes can be so popular. Many have an underlying message. A recent Facebook privacy hoax inspired users to share faux copyright legalese with all their friends. In the words of one worried Facebook poster, ""It may have been a hoax, but it did not hurt!"" The sentiment of the post text was important, regardless of where it originated. Then, even more recently, actor Morgan Freeman found himself in a quotation controversy regarding comments attributed to him about last month's school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 children dead. The statement, which blamed the media for sensationalizing the tragedy, spread on social media. ""He neither wrote nor posted nor had any knowledge of it,"" Freeman's publicist told HLN. Still, Freeman's star power helped propel a provocative idea. Likewise, Jefferson's words appear to have also been in great demand since the Newtown shooting. The Monticello.org site techs have recorded an uptick in traffic to their quotations area since early December. Spokeswoman Lisa Stites sent along statistics indicating traffic increases of nearly 1,000% on some of the remarks, and especially on the ""spurious"" quotes. Several of these quotations have appeared in CNN comments. Anna Berkes, research librarian at the Jefferson Library, said there are extensive records of Jefferson's writings and communications. Just about every quotation from Jefferson can be documented somehow, she said. The earliest reference to the ""tyranny in government"" quotation that Berkes has noted thus far is within a 1989 opinion-editorial about gun rights from The Orlando Sentinel in Florida. She said the first part of the section of the article where the quotation appears, which begins with ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms,"" has been verified. But the rest of it has not been found in Jefferson's writings. Berkes said there are often clues that help identify quotes from Jefferson, such as the vocabulary of his time and the typical sentence styles he used. Over time, Berkes added, a researcher gains a keen sense for these discrepancies; Jefferson composed mostly written communication rather than text meant to be spoken. ""Jefferson was very wordy, and a lot of the quotes I see are very snappy,"" Berkes said. ""They sound like they were maybe composed by a 20th century speechwriter."" Stites said Monticello's keepers don't want to get caught up in the political debates about gun control, but there is a lot of community interest in Jefferson's real and falsely attributed quotations, so Jefferson Library researchers provide resources based on searches through electronic and physical archives of Jefferson's writings. Stephen Halbrook, an attorney and author of the book ""The Founders' Second Amendment,"" said he doesn't understand why someone would want to use a fake quotation. ""For years I've seen bogus quotes on gun issues in the Internet,"" he said. ""Since the Founding Fathers were so positive on Second Amendment rights, I couldn't understand why anyone would feel compelled to invent quotes."" Halbrook said Jefferson was a big supporter of the right to own firearms. ""Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, and served two terms as president,"" he said. ""He personally possessed numerous firearms for hunting, target shooting, collecting, self-defense and defense against tyranny. He deemed being armed the mark of a true citizen. The American Revolution was won by an armed populace against the British standing army."" The GunCite website includes quotations from the founding fathers, but has pages for debunked and reliable remarks. Site creator Howard Picard said the quotes help explain the Constitution's meaning. ""There are politicians, scholars, jurists, and others who don't believe the Second Amendment was intended to preserve and guarantee an individual right to arms outside of active militia duty,"" Picard said. ""Some go as far as to claim firearms ownership was solely a collective right."" He said the quotes show that the Second Amendment was intended to protect not only a ""vigorous individual right"" but also ""to serve as a check against an usurpation of our government."" Saul Cornell, a professor at Fordham University, said some quotations may need context, especially those from the ""losing side"" of debates. He added that he believes both sides of the gun conversation tend to oversimplify the Founding Fathers' historical intent. ""Without being too professorial about it,"" he said, ""depending on what theory of the Constitution we use, you can get very different interpretations of the Second Amendment."" Cornell, who is the Paul and Diane Guenther Chair in American History at the school, said the Constitution incorporates lessons learned while the nation was under the Articles of Confederation. He said the turmoil of Shays' Rebellion stirred up fears of mob rule among many leaders. He also compared the militias of early America to a form of taxation, saying that citizens had what Jefferson referred to as a ""right and duty"" to be armed. That is, they were required to buy weapons in addition to being allowed to possess them. Militia membership was often compulsory, Cornell said. He questions whether the Founding Fathers would have welcomed the idea of people taking up arms against their newly hatched constitutional government instead of using governmental procedure to settle differences, which sometimes is referred to as the ""ballots vs. bullets"" debate. The Jefferson quotation's emphasis on battling the government caught the attention of reader David McSwain, a gun owner and Second Amendment supporter from Charlotte, North Carolina. ""I don't think the sentiment is out of line with Jefferson's thinking in view of his other verifiable statements such as 'a little rebellion now and then is a good thing,' etc.,"" he said. ""Yet I think Jefferson would reject the ultraright modern day belief that armed rebellion will be needed in the near future against a socialist, unconstitutional federal government."" McSwain said he feels there is a need to avoid extremist views and added that he believes most people have a nuanced perspective on guns. He expressed a desire to define ""that ragged line between civilian and military weapons."" ""Exactly where that line gets drawn is something that Americans should think about, argue about, and then vote their convictions,"" he said. ""I think the vast majority of Americans and Mr. Jefferson would agree with me."" What's your favorite (true) quotation from a historical figure?

"(CNN) -- Facebook and its photo-sharing subsidiary Instagram Wednesday announced new policies aimed at stemming online sales of illegal guns. The social media platforms have agreed to remove reported posts that evade gun laws, restrict minors under the age of 18 from viewing posts about firearm sales and provide education to better inform law-abiding sellers of guns. ""By taking these unprecedented educational and enforcement efforts, we've been able to strike an important balance in helping people express themselves, while promoting a safe and responsible community,"" Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management, said at a news conference. The new rules come after campaigns by gun safety organizations nationwide have pushed for stricter controls on the sale of firearms. Moms Demand Action, an organization devoted to gun-control reforms, started on a Facebook page in December 2012, shortly after a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The organization lobbies for more restrictive gun policies that protect the safety of children and families. Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts said more than 230,000 Americans signed the group's petition, tweeted or used other social media to ask Facebook and Instagram to crack down on online sales. The organization last year campaigned for Starbucks to ban guns in stores, resulting in an open letter by CEO Howard Schultz telling customers to leave guns at home. Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the largest gun violence prevention group, which was founded by former Mayors Michael Bloomberg of New York and Thomas Menino of Boston, discussed the issue with Facebook officials. ""People are logging onto the Internet and signing into what has become, unfortunately, a virtual gun show,"" John Feinblatt, chairman of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in a conference call Wednesday. In November, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman joined efforts to persuade Facebook and Instagram to issue new gun rules. ""Responsible social media sites know that it is in no one's interest for their sites to become a 21st century black market in dangerous and illegal goods that place our families and communities at risk,"" Schneiderman said in a statement. Facebook already prohibits ads for the sale of guns or ammunition, said Bickert, adding that the new rules will strengthen that policy. Neither Facebook nor Instagram are e-commerce sites, but both facilitate conversation and provide an open marketplace that makes it possible to exchange information promoting weapons sales. Gun sales listed by site users talked about ""no background check required"" or said ""will cross state lines,"" Feinblatt said. Law enforcement officers and advocacy groups will have a direct connection to Facebook to flag posts that may promote this illegal activity, officials said.","Facebook and Instagram to regulate posts about illegal gun sales .

"Washington (CNN) -- With just days to go until a self-imposed deadline, fixes to the problem-plagued Obamacare website are ""definitely on track,"" Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Tuesday. In a conference call with state and local officials, Sebelius added that ""this isn't a magic 'turn on the on switch'"" to fix HealthCare.gov, but a continual process in which ""the experience is vastly improved each and every day."" ""We are definitely on track to have a significantly different user experience by the end of this month -- that was our commitment -- than people experienced on October 1"" when the enrollment website launched, she said. ""We've added hardware, we've added software; we're continuing to work on the parts of the website that were too confusing to people,"" Sebelius continued, urging the officials ""to not hesitate to recommend that people go to HealthCare.gov and get signed up because that experience is currently working much better and it will continue to work much better."" On Monday, a White House spokesman said the administration would meet President Barack Obama's goal of having the website working for the ""vast majority"" of users by November 30. Supreme Court to take up Obamacare contraception case . Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that the tech team working on HealthCare.gov has increased the site's capacity, boosting it to a level of 50,000 ""concurrent"" users. Recurring breakdowns, error messages and delays botched the federal web portal rollout on October 1, opening the President's signature health care reform effort to new and fierce Republican criticism while questions about the administration's ability to manage the sweeping health insurance overhaul. The GOP opposition targets the entire 2010 Affordable Care Act, not just the website woes, as the ultimate example of big government run amok. In particular, they accuse Obama and Democrats of having lied when they pledged that people could keep health coverage they liked. Cancellation notices to some private policy holders -- a tiny percentage compared to the overall number of Americans who get their coverage through their employers or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid -- fueled the Republican charges. In response, Obama said insurers can choose to continue offering canceled policies, even if they failed to meet new requirements under the health care reforms. At the same time, he defended the overall goal of Obamacare to make make affordable health coverage available to millions of previously uninsured or under-insured Americans. On Tuesday, Obama repeated his criticism of Republicans who seek to dismantle the reforms instead of working with the White House and Democrats to fix any problems and build on them. ""We'd be a lot further along if we could just get folks to act with some sense, if we didn't have one wing of one party that was a little less obsessed with repealing health care for 40 million people, more concerned with making sure the law works,"" he said in remarks during a visit to the Dreamworks Studio in California. Enrollment figures for the first month after the opening of the new health insurance exchanges under Obamacare were much lower than initially expected. Now some states have reported stronger numbers, and Sebelius said Tuesday that more people were signing up daily. Boehner signs up for Obamacare, with government support . She declined to provide any specifics, even when asked by a local official on the call for a demographic breakdown on who was signing up. Such details weren't yet available, Sebelius said. According to a CNN count based on available figures, just over 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under Obamacare -- either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the District of Columbia. The enrollment period runs until March 31, and officials have said the target for the first year was seven million people. In addition, more than 370,000 have signed up for Medicaid under state programs expanded through the health care reforms, the CNN count shows. Sebelius told the conference call with state and local officials that Improvements to HealthCare.gov would continue beyond December 1. She urgent the officials to continue their efforts to spread information in their communities to help people enroll for Affordable Care Act coverage, saying: ""You tap into local events, you know the communities better than anyone, you know the targets for high numbers of uninsured and under-insured folks who live in your area, and I think that partnership is just hugely important.""

Click here to get all the facts on President Obama's speech to the nation on his new strategy to combat ISIS with air strikes in Iraq and Syria. Or click here to read the transcript. Below are some key themes identified by CNN's military and political commentators and reporters: . It is a stunning turnaround from his previous policy - This new strategy represents a turnaround by President Obama on so many levels; there are things the President refused to do that that he is now doing. He had said he would not arm Syrian rebels. He had said there would be no air strikes in Syria. Now the President says the U.S. and its coalition will hunt down ISIS wherever it may be. But it is important to note that the President never used the word 'war.' He calls this a counter-terror operation - Jim Sciutto - CNN Chief National Security Correspondent . Related: Sen. John McCain has showdown with Jay Carney over Obama speech on CNN . It was a speech the president did not want to give - Let's take a step back. This is a speech the President never intended to give, didn't want to give, and has been ambivalent about what he ought to do. This is a President whose narrative was killing Osama bin Laden and ending two wars. What he did tonight when he stepped up to the microphone, he essentially said, ""I am going to get involved in large airstrikes over two countries in a conflict that could well outlast his administration. There is no end point to this."" I think for the president tonight, this was a very difficult speech for him to give. - Gloria Borger - CNN Chief Political Analyst . Related: Strong reaction to Obama statement 'ISIL is not Islamic' Enacting Obama's vision presents real issues for the military - I put myself in the position of my friend, Gen. Lloyd Austin, Combatant Commander, Central Command. What is he hearing right now? I think what Gen. Austin hears was, ""Let me get this straight. You want me to expand operations into a country that is having a civil war, where we don't like the leader of the country. We're expanding operations in a country that is still having a religious war and has a little bit of turmoil in their government. You're are asking me to train more forces, bring potentially a 40-member coalition together and conduct air strikes where I don't hurt innocents."" - CNN military analyst Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, U.S. Army, ret. Related: As Obama prepares for ISIS fight, where are the doves? Obama was candid about the risks to Americans and the military - The President was candid about the threat of ISIS, the long term nature of the challenge and the risks of military action. Using Yemen and Somalia as examples of the fight against terrorism is understandable given the unpopularity of Iraq/Afghanistan, but critics were quick to say ISIS is a bigger, more complex challenge. More than anything, long term success relies on players that for years have proven unreliable: the Iraqi government, the Syrian opposition and regional partners, like the Saudis. - John King, CNN Chief National Correspondent . It strangely threw in a pitch for the American economy - I thought the first part of the speech as he talked about the attack on ISIS was strong and presidential and serious. You could quibble with it, I am sure there will be disagreements. But as a presidential speech, it did very well. What surprised me was the second part of the speech when he started to talk about how well the country is doing with jobs and leading around the world. I think for an awful lot of people, America is feeling pretty blue right now. I think those kind of assertions don't ring true to a lot of people. It seemed to me it detracted from the main message of the speech. - David Gergen - CNN commentator and former adviser to presidents from both political parties .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""We've seen the movie before,"" Sen. John McCain said recently on CNN's ""New Day."" Oh, how right you are, Senator. When Bill Murray's clock radio goes off at 6 a.m. and Sonny and Cher's tune ""I've got you Babe"" plays in the '90s classic ""Groundhog Day,"" perhaps the radio should have been tuned into the latest news from Washington. The Arizona senator was talking about the government shutdown that is being threatened on October 1. Congress and the president are again at loggerheads on how to move forward as the government's money runs out at the end of the fiscal year this month and federal agencies are once again warning employees and preparing contingency plans for a closed government. All this because Republicans are making demands in exchange for government funding and Democrats are saying ""no way."" ""We are committed to changing the status quo in Washington and restoring our fiscal stability,"" a tea party-backed House freshman said. ""At a time when the economy is just beginning to grow, where we're just starting to see a pickup in employment, the last thing we need is a disruption that's caused by a government shutdown,"" President Barack Obama argued. While the above two statements could have been made today, the lines were drawn more than two years ago -- in the weeks before the first major battle between newly empowered libertarian-oriented Republicans and Democrats that nearly led to a government shutdown. House GOP: Defund Obama care or shut government down . Again? Seriously? You aren't dreaming. And you aren't starring in ""Groundhog Day II."" You have heard this before. A government shutdown is a possibility and the issues haven't changed: the size and cost of government, the debt limit and health care. Your guide to a government shutdown . Some House Republicans are threatening to prevent mandatory, annual government spending bills from moving forward if the health care law, also known as Obamacare, isn't defunded. It's a tactic that Democrats have flatly rejected and even many in the Republican Party, including House Speaker John Boehner, advise against. Republican strategist and CNN contributor David Frum also offered words of caution. ""[R]epeal-or-bust is much more likely to produce a bust than a repeal,"" he wrote in an editorial on CNN.com on Monday. ""More productive is the challenge of reforming Obamacare so that the nation can live with its costs,"" he added. Julian Zelizer, history professor at Princeton, entered the debate with an editorial. He said the Republican Party's strategy to address the budget through ""risky"" showdowns ""hurts its ability to persuade the public that the Republicans are interested in seriously pursuing fiscal restraint, as opposed to using this issue for purely partisan purposes."" That's McCain's point. ""Republicans ought to understand if we shut down the government, Congress always gets blamed -- rightly or wrongly -- Congress gets blamed,"" McCain said Monday. He's right. According to a recent CNN/ ORC International Poll, 51% of respondents would blame Republicans in Congress if the government closes its doors in October. Adding to the tension, in mid- to late-October, the debt ceiling is set to be reached. It's a convoluted term that means the United States would have reached its borrowing limit and would be unable to pay bills already incurred -- or default on its loans. Republicans have signaled they want to extract spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the debt limit. Obama said he ""will not negotiate"" on the debt ceiling. ""Congress needs to get it done without triggering another crisis, without shutting down our government, or worse, threatening not to pay this country's bill[s],"" the president said in an economic speech Monday. ""I think we're facing an extraordinary few weeks of potential turmoil at the least and crisis at the worst,"" CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein said. That could be the most oft-repeated political statement of the past few years. Obamacare, spending showdown heats up in House . It goes way back -- to April 2011 . Just five months after Republicans won a huge majority in the House of Representatives, seizing control of half of one branch of government from Democrats, the first major fiscal fight came to a head. ""If the government shuts down, it will be the Republicans' responsibility,"" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said then. ""There's no question that a shutdown is coming, whether we do it today or whether we do it in 20 years,"" then-Republican Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina said at the time, drawing attention to an increase in government spending. A last-minute deal -- literally last-minute -- was reached to keep the government open with a short-term spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, until September. Q&A: The lowdown on the shutdown, or why you should care about the CR . Through the standoff, Republicans won a $38.5 billion reduction in government spending, restricted access to abortions and an extension of the school voucher program in Washington, D.C., and a vote in the Senate to delay the implementation of Obamacare. The deal effectively started the clock until the next crisis. August 2011: Ditching on debt ... ""Default would cause a financial crisis potentially more severe than the crisis from which we are only now starting to recover,"" Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a letter to Congress in 2011, warning lawmakers of the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling. During that battle, Republicans demanded spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the debt ceiling. Another 11th-hour deal averted default, but the U.S. credit rating was downgraded anyway. The agreement only temporarily shelved the debt ceiling debate, however. And it set the stage for a much larger fight down the road. While it cut more than $900 billion from the budget over 10 years, it also put into place the framework for forced, across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester. Congress would have just more than a year to figure out a way to cut an additional $1 trillion from the federal budget over the next decade or the automatic spending cuts on both defense and domestic programs would go into place. September 2011: Kicking the can ... Yep, just one month later, another battle over spending nearly led to a government shutdown -- the third such battle of 2011. Two years ago, White House spokesman Jay Carney said something eerily familiar: ""The fever hasn't broken,"" he told reporters, referring to budget battles in Congress that threatened a government shutdown. This time the September 2011 threats revolved around the amount of disaster relief funding. While Democrats said Republicans were ""holding hostage"" aid to Americans hit by natural disasters, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said Democrats have chosen ""to engage in a political stare-down match that will bring us one step closer to a government shutdown."" Mild by comparison to the previous two fights as it ended days before the deadline, Congress reached an agreement that reduced the amount of disaster relief for states. December 2012: Walking the edge of the fiscal cliff . Crisis, debt limit, tax increases, budget cuts, default: common words written (again) and spoken (again) in Washington this past holiday season. ""Hopefully there is still time for an agreement of some kind that saves the taxpayers from a wholly preventable economic crisis,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in the lead-up to that fiscal showdown. There's that word again. Crisis. Another pending economic crisis. That fight was dubbed the ""fiscal cliff."" It was the culmination of ad-hoc agreements from previous government shutdown debates since 2011. Lawmakers worked through New Year's Eve to reach a deal on tax rates, the debt ceiling and government spending levels. While Congress agreed to raise the debt limit and raise a series of taxes, including on the wealthiest Americans, an agreement on government spending levels was not reached and the forced spending cuts -- the sequester -- went into effect, trimming up to 10% off non-mandatory federal defense and domestic programs. March 2013: Again? ""The full faith and credit of the United States of America is not a bargaining chip,"" the president said in January as Washington geared up for another fight over the debt ceiling, spending and Obamacare. This debate was an extension of the New Year's Eve ""fiscal cliff"" battle. If Congress didn't reach an agreement, the result: you guessed it, government shutdown. What resulted was a spending bill that kept the government open until September 30 and also kept deep, across-the-board budget cuts in place that cut $85 billion across the board for the remainder of the year - and $1 trillion over 10 years - from military and domestic programs. And here we are . That leads us to today. A new day but same story: Congress and the president are drawing lines in the sand over the same issues with the same dramatic consequences if they fail to reach an agreement. ""This country has worked too hard for too long to dig out of a crisis just to see their elected representatives here in Washington purposely cause another crisis,"" Obama said Monday on the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis. ""President Obama, Harry Reid, will scream and holler that the mean, nasty Republicans are threatening to shut down the government,"" Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said on CNN in August. ""And at that point, Republicans have to do something we haven't done in a long time -- stand up and win the argument."" ""We're really seeing the same issues that have divided President Obama and the Republican House since January of 2011, coming back yet again, almost in this kind of circular loop that we're stuck in of fiscal crises that we can't get out of,"" Brownstein said. Now might be a whole new understanding of Bill Murray when his character, Phil Connors, punches Ned in the face after the umpteenth time of having the same, annoying interaction. CNN's Joe Johns contributed to this story .","Talk of a government shutdown is like a scene in the movie ""Groundhog Day""

"(CNN) -- The ancient Chinese were stonewall masters. China not only has the world's longest fortification, the 21,196-kilometer-long Great Wall, but arguably the world's longest circular city wall, the Ming City Wall, which was originally 35 kilometers around. The latter stands in Jiangsu's provincial capital of Nanjing. It's one of China's most underrated tourist attractions. Some 22 of the remaining 25 kilometers of the once-inaccessible wall are scheduled to open to the public in August. (Currently, visitors can access only about three kilometers of the wall.) The opening coincides with the local government's preparations for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games (August 16-24) and is part of an effort to snag the Ming City Wall a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2015. The wall was built between 1366 and 1386 to protect the founding capital of the Ming Dynasty. ""In the past, the wall was the end of the city,"" says Sun Xiaowei, 32, president of the Nanjing-based urban hiking community, HigKing Group. ""But now it's the starting point of Nanjing's culture. It's the most direct reminder of Nanjing's eventful history."" Sun recently shared with CNN what he considers the best route to take to get the most out of this generally ignored Chinese treasure. Stop 1: Zhonghua Gate . Located immediately to the north of Qinhuai River, Zhonghua Gate, or the Gate of China, is one of the best preserved and most intricate barbicans in the world, according to Sun. The gate is used as a grand entrance to any tour of the City Wall. It once served as the southern gate of ancient Nanjing, a 15,168-square-meter fortification that contained four layers of defenses, as well as three grand castles, the ruins of which are connected to each other by a wide ring of wall. After paying an entry fee, visitors can view former garrisons, an exhibition about the history and variety of bricks used to build the City Wall. Visitors can also climb up a platform with an impressive view over the Qinhuai River to the south and buzzing downtown to the north. It's possible to rent a bike and ride atop the wall to Dongshui Guan, a Ming watergate 2.7 kilometers to the northeast. Zhonghua Gate, Qinhuai District, Nanjing; +86 25 8662 5435; open from 8 a.m.-9 p.m.; RMB 35 ($5.50) Stop 2: Dongshui Guan . Dongshui Guan, or the East Water Checkpoint, is a 10-minute bike ride along the wall or a 30-minute walk from Zhonghua Gate. The restored compound is the only watergate on the Ming City Wall, according to Sun. In recent years, the gate and its surrounding area have been redeveloped into a 41,500-square-meter public park. ""If you stand on the highest point of the park, you can have a bird's-eye-view over the whole watergate,"" says Sun. ""The busy modern metropolis in the background and the grand checkpoint in the foreground form an interesting contrast."" Dongshui Guan Ruins Park, Dongshuiguantou Road, Qinhuai District . Stop 3: Wu Gate . It's worth sparing an hour to walk northward from Dongshui Guan to Wu Gate. The route passes through some of the widest ancient streets in Nanjing. Yudao Jie street was the exclusive carriageway of Ming emperors -- you'll find Wu Gate located at its terminus. The stone gate heralds the entrance of the Ming Imperial Palace, which is believed to have served as the blueprint for the Forbidden City in Beijing. The majority of the defunct palace has been transformed into a green space open to the public. The park itself contains a restored gate, an original inner moat, ruins of the Hall of Praying to Heaven and a stonewall with intricate Ming-era carvings of fabled animals. This is a good place for people watching. Nanjing is at its most lively here, with sword-dance performers, chess players and tai chi students filling up every corner. Strangely, the doorway of Wu Gate has become a meeting point for the local saxophone community. On weekend afternoons, you can find dozens of saxophone enthusiasts blasting out mini-concerts in the shadow of imperial power. Wuchaomen Park, Ming Gugong Road, Baixia District; open 7:30 a.m.-10 p.m. Stop 4: Jiefang Gate . From Wumen, it's another hour's walk to reach Jie Fang, or Liberation Gate, a newly built fortress added to the wall in 1952. Scenery en route includes the crowded commercial thoroughfare Zhujiang Road (good for electronics shopping), a stretch of Beijing Dong Road (home to the Nanjing City Government) and the imposing Cock-crowing Temple. According to Sun, the gate was added to the wall to facilitate air raid evacuations and traffic between the two sides of the wall. Although it's newly built, Sun considers the gate a part of the ""longest, tallest and best preserved stretch of the Ming Wall,"" which zigzags from Xuanwu Gate to Taiping Gate. The wall terminates next to the Cock-crowing Temple, giving visitors a stunning view toward gilded halls and Buddhist pagodas. Jiefang Gate, Jiming Si Road, Xuanwu District . Stop 5: Taicheng . Next up is Taicheng, a five-minute walk on top of the wall from Jiefang Gate. The view from here is breathtaking. On one side lies Xuanwu Lake, a 3.68-square-kilometer refuge in the heart of the city that's home to best park in Nanjing. Here, locals share their collective passion for speed-walking along the shore. On the other side of Taicheng, decorative Cock-crow Temple and sleek skyscraper Zifeng Tower can be framed within the same photo. The 450-meter-tall Zifeng is the second tallest completed building in mainland China and home to InterContinental Nanjing. The Nanjing History Museum of the Ming City Wall is located inside the Taicheng wall section -- it's worth a detour for those keen to see more bricks. Taicheng, No. 8 Jiefang Gate, Huanhu Road, Xuanwu District; +86 25 8321 7200; open 8 a.m.-5:30 p.m.; RMB 15 ($2.50) Stop 6: Heping Gate . To find the most complete gate along the Ming City Wall, you'll need to walk along Xuanwu Lake til you reach the northernmost point of the old Nanjing City, which forms a straight north-south axis with Zhonghua Gate on the southern boundary. Located just to the north of Xuanwu Lake, the fortress, also known as Shence Gate, was a guarded military zone inaccessible to the public for more than seven decades, according to Sun. As a result, Heping or Peace Gate is the only gate of 13 along the Ming City Wall to have a watchtower that predates 1912, the founding of the Republic of China. The gate was repurposed as a public park in 2006. The 1,600-meter stretch of wall between Xuanwu Gate and Shence Gate is a key section of the government's plan to open more of the wall to the public this year.

"Denver (CNN) -- How did an unlicensed professional, who led people to believe he was a medical doctor, run a facility for adolescents with mental illness and drug abuse problems for decades, despite complaint after complaint to state regulators alleging abuse? That's the question that haunts some of the alleged victims of an inpatient treatment center that operated in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, for about 30 years. A CNN investigation uncovered at least 15 civil suits and some two dozen complaints to state regulators against Adolescent and Family Institute of Colorado, also known as AFIC. The allegations include verbal and sexual abuse, unauthorized discontinuance of psychotropic medication and fraud. The man in charge, AFIC's president and founder, Alexander Panio Jr., was not a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist in the state of Colorado, yet he was allegedly treating patients, and participating in and enabling the abuse at his facility. ""It did the most incredible damage to our family,"" said Rick Palmer, who's filed a civil suit against AFIC, Panio and other staff members. Rick and Sylvia Palmer turned to AFIC in 2011 to help their then-16-year-old daughter, Jessica, a star soccer player who was struggling with mental illness and drug addiction. But instead of getting help, the Palmers say, Jessica was harmed. In their civil suit, the Palmers claim Jessica ""was repeatedly told by AFIC staff that she was a 'bitch,' 'dumb,' and a [expletive]. She was told that her parents didn't love her and that she was the source of all their problems."" The Palmers also allege Jessica was cut off from her family, was abruptly taken off her bipolar medication without authorization, and was brainwashed into believing she was faking her mental illness. ""As a result of her experience at AFIC, Jessica Palmer became more depressed, suicidal and filled with self-loathing,"" according to the civil suit. Jessica Palmer took her own life in 2012, less than a year after leaving AFIC. In court documents, AFIC and staff deny all claims. The Palmers' suit is pending, but both sides tell CNN they have agreed on settlement terms. Complaint after complaint . The Palmers are not alone. Colorado public records obtained by CNN detail similar complaints and other alleged abuses that date back to the mid-1980s. The allegations of abuse include sexual misconduct during physical exams, such as fondling and measuring genitalia. Another civil suit involving a 14-year-old patient of AFIC, who is referred to only as ""Baby Doe"" because she is a minor, alleges: ""Baby Doe was required to bend over and touch her toes while [staff members] stood behind her, evaluating her exposed buttocks and genitalia. Baby Doe was then told to squat and 'walk like a duck' across the floor."" The civil suit alleges the patient began to cry and was threatened with humiliation -- ""she would be labeled as having [sexually transmitted diseases] ... and disallowed from participating in certain activities"" -- if she did not allow the exam. AFIC and staff members deny these allegations. Court documents show a settlement is pending. Public records also show repeated complaints of verbal abuse made to the Colorado Department of Human Services as early as 1990 through 2012 that allege degrading, derogatory, humiliating, and at times racially charged rants directed at patients and family members. A county social worker who attended a patient evaluation wrote to state regulators in 1998: . ""I am concerned that the treatment my client recently received in a pre-placement interview ... was demeaning and humiliating to him and basically stripped away his dignity as a human being. ... In my opinion, they tore him to shreds. ... In the 20 years I've worked in the field of Human Services, I have never seen a professional treat a youngster in a way that totally disregards him as a human being with worth. ... Incarceration is more humane."" ""We were just belittled and degraded and made to feel so small we could barely get up off the mat,"" said Aimee Donabedian, the plaintiff in another civil suit. Donabedian said her son Chris, 16 years old at the time, was neglected and abused at AFIC in 2010. His family checked him into AFIC after a psychiatrist had diagnosed Chris with major depression with psychotic features, a precursor to schizophrenia, and had started him on medication. ""We were told that the next step would be to have him in residential care for a few weeks to get him acclimated to his medication,"" Donabedian told CNN. The Donabedian lawsuit alleges AFIC discontinued Chris' medications abruptly and without tapering. ""My illness just progressively got worse when I was there,"" Chris Donabedian told CNN. He said he started hallucinating, hearing voices and begged for his medication but was denied. ""I was way worse when I left. Just the voices were really bad,"" he said. Chris Donabedian has been diagnosed with schizophrenia since leaving AFIC. Aimee Donabedian described her son's treatment as abuse. ""The abuse of not being allowed to have his medications. The abuse of being told that he's basically, no good, just the scum of the earth, that he's just a liar and a manipulator and he's really not sick."" AFIC and staff members, named as defendants in the Donabedian civil suit, deny all of these allegations. Donabedian said the civil suit was a result of months of research ""because no normal person could wrap their head around what was going on at AFIC."" She discovered that Panio wasn't licensed to practice medicine or psychotherapy but was allegedly diagnosing and treating patients. ""What we experienced there was bait and switch,"" Donabedian said. 'Dr. Panio' Panio got his doctorate in psychology in 1979 from a distance-learning school. Its accreditation at the time was not government-approved and it no longer offers PhDs in psychology, the school confirmed to CNN. But he went by ""Dr. Panio"" even before 1979. In fact, officials at Northwestern University, where he was a faculty member from 1972 to 1978, told CNN they believed he was a medical doctor. University records show him listed as ""Alexander Panio Jr., M.D."" Chicago Tribune articles dating as far back as 1970 even refer to him as ""Dr. Alexander Panio Jr."" ""I think he experienced great joy in pulling strings and controlling people's lives and affecting them and playing doctor,"" said Donabedian. CNN tried repeatedly to contact Panio, both directly and through his lawyers, to ask about the allegations of abuse at AFIC and about his credentials, but he avoided our cameras and never returned phone calls. In court documents, Panio denies all allegations of abuse and stands by his credentials. Panio's attorney Katherine Fritz told CNN Panio cannot talk due to settlement terms in a number of civil suits, including the Palmers' and Donabedians'. The state's response . During the approximately 30 years Panio ran his facility, state records show he was only registered to practice psychotherapy between 1992 and 1998. Then his registration expired. The state confirms he was never licensed as a psychiatrist or psychologist in Colorado. Hundreds of pages of public records obtained by CNN show state regulators were alerted to problems at AFIC and they did investigate. Yet, time and again, the authorities said the allegations ""could not be confirmed."" The Colorado Board of Registered Psychotherapists did issue Panio a cease-and-desist order in March of 2013 for his alleged diagnosis and treatment of patients at AFIC, which Panio appealed. The state Department of Regulatory Agencies told CNN the parties are still waiting for a ruling by the administrative law judge regarding this case. Even so, the cease-and-desist order only addresses Panio's licensing issues, not the alleged abuse. The Department of Human Services, the Department of Regulatory Agencies and even the governor's office refused multiple requests for an interview by CNN. Instead, the Departments of Human Services and Regulatory Agencies issued a joint statement that reads: . ""Any additional information regarding this former facility, Mr. Panio and the respective licenses and credentials is part of an ongoing case in which final disposition has not been reached and therefore cannot be discussed in an interview."" The state never shut down AFIC. The facility closed voluntarily on July 1, 2013, after several of the civil suits were filed leading to at least one key member of the staff leaving. Many of the employees, who allegedly participated in the abuse, are licensed to continue working. No criminal charges have been filed involving AFIC. However, Wheat Ridge police are investigating. ""We've had to involve a lot of other agencies on this particular investigation. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot I can discuss at this time because the case is still under investigation,"" said John Romero, public information officer for the Wheat Ridge Police Department. Demanding justice . For the Palmer family, it's not enough. ""I think (AFIC) shoved us over a bridge, burned it, and then took away any tools we had to rebuild it,"" said Sylvia Palmer. ""The mess they made in her mind was permanent and final."" Her parents allege AFIC staff convinced their daughter that she was faking her mental illness. ""Jess believed it when she got out. She truly believed she was a fraud, that she was a cheat, she was a liar, that she was all of the things she was prompted and worse,"" Sylvia Palmer said. A note from Jessica's journal, written at AFIC, reads: . ""I'm a fraud. I'm just a waste of space.... I want to be gone from here. Whether that looks like jail, an institution, or death."" Jessica Palmer was just 17 years old when she killed herself. ""They sucked the life out of our daughter,"" Rick Palmer told CNN. ""Somebody needs to do something.""","Adolescent and Family Institute of Colorado operated for nearly 30 years .

"(CNN) -- One day before convicted school shooter T.J. Lane jumped a fence and fled an Ohio prison, staff at that prison segregated an inmate and warned officials about an escape plot there, the head of the prison guards' union said Friday. Christopher Mabe, the president of the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, told CNN the segregated inmate was not T.J. Lane, the 19-year-old who killed three students at a high school cafeteria east of Cleveland in 2012. Mabe could not say if the segregated inmate was one of the other two prisoners who escaped with Lane from the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, Ohio, on Thursday night. What Mabe did say is the inmate was segregated Wednesday and that prison staff filed documentation that day about the escape plan. A union spokeswoman provided CNN with a copy of that report Friday night. It read: ""(A corrections) officer ... was approached in the OCF cafe by an inmate who wanted to advise me that (another) inmate ... had told him that he was planning on escaping and finding (a corrections officer) and killing her. I immediately reported this to Lt. Brown."" Sally Meckling, the union spokeswoman, acknowledged that the inmate who allegedly was planning to escape was segregated at the request of a corrections officer. No one has tied this reported plot to the escape of Lane and the two others. ""We are not making that direct link,"" Meckling said. ""But we do think more precautions should have been made."" The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction is looking into this report, department spokesman Joellen Smith said Friday. All three escapees are now back in custody. Lane was found outside a church 100 yards away from the prison shortly after 1 a.m. Friday. Lane has never explained his motive for the February 27, 2012 attack in which he entered the cafeteria with a .22-caliber gun and randomly started shooting, killing three students. Convicted school shooter back in custody . Still, while the manhunt is over, the fact that Lane and the others managed to escape has stirred big questions. Some wonder why Lane wasn't in the maximum-security part of the prison, even though he was serving consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for the Chardon High School shooting -- an incident for which he's never shown remorse. ""That is something we have to sit down and take a look at,"" Warden Kevin Jones said. Ohio's Correctional Institution Inspection Committee, which evaluates the state's correctional facilities and reports to the legislature, most recently reported on the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution last April. It found ""ongoing concern regarding the Protective Control unit,"" while also noting there has been improvement in that unit and ""fewer security management concerns."" Their overall rating for the facility was ""good"" -- the second best grade out of four. Ohio school shooter shows no remorse at sentencing .

"(CNN) -- Chinese travelers are now the top source of tourism cash in the world, according to a new report by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Boosted by a rising Chinese currency, Chinese travelers spent a record US$102 billion on international tourism in 2012, a 40 percent rise from US$73 billion in 2011. Chinese tourism: The good, the bad, the backlash . The results fall right in line with China's outbound tourism growth over the last 10 years. The UNWTO says the volume of international trips by Chinese travelers grew from 10 million in 2000 to 83 million in 2012, making it the world's fastest-growing market. So what's behind the increase? The UNWTO credits rapid urbanization, rising disposable incomes and the relaxation of government restrictions on foreign travel. ""In 2005 China ranked seventh in international tourism expenditure, and has since successively overtaken Italy, Japan, France and the United Kingdom,"" says the report. ""With the 2012 surge, China leaped to first place, surpassing both top spender Germany and second largest spender United States (both close to US$84 billion in 2012)."" Though the report did not break down spending per trip amongst international travelers, calculating total spend by number of trips suggests Chinese travelers averaged a spend of $1,230 per trip. By 2015, 100 million Chinese will travel abroad, a benchmark originally forecast for 2020, according to the UNWTO. And now that China's State Council has crafted a landmark plan to kick start Chinese outbound tourism even further, expect more phenomenal growth figures. It is dubbed the ""Outline for National Tourism and Leisure (2013-2020)"" and is a roadmap for restructuring the current paid leave system across China with an aim to encourage governmental agencies, social organizations, enterprises and public institutions to promote the use of leave days. Importantly, it also gives Chinese workers more freedom and flexibility of where and when to travel. It's all about shopping . And what do Chinese travelers prefer to do on their trips? According to Dr. Yong Chen of Hong Kong Polytechnic University who specializes in Chinese outbound tourism, unlike other global travelers, Chinese tourists focus mainly on shopping. ""It is the most prominent difference and more evidential in recent years,"" says Chen. ""If you look at Chinese tourists 10 years ago, they will mainly buy souvenirs. Nowadays, they want to buy luxury products in Italy or Paris like handbags and watches."" Dr. Wolfgang Georg Arlt, director of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute (COTRI), agrees, saying shopping is one of the main drivers for Chinese tourists. ""Luxury goods are 20-30% cheaper in other global cities. If you plan to spend US$10,000 on shopping and only spend US$1,000 on airfare, it's much cheaper for Chinese tourists to fly abroad to shop."" Traveling is also a form of soft power, he adds, so it's only natural for the Chinese government to support its citizens to head abroad. ""For Chinese people the United States is the only competitor left,"" he says. ""They have an interest in the model for capitalistic development and want to see what they can learn so they can overtake and become number one."" Chinese are very proud of the fact that they are traveling, he adds, given the Cultural Revolution is still fresh the minds of people over 40. ""This happened all in one generation,"" he says. ""Many have parents who didn't have shoes. All this growth happened so fast it's still in living memory. ""Now they're showing the world and themselves: 'I'm strong, I can go spend US$5,000 for nothing, just my pleasure.'"" Other hot markets . Other emerging markets to increase tourism spending abroad over the past decade include Russia, which saw an increase of 32 percent in 2012 to US$43 billion, bringing it from seventh to fifth place in the international tourism spending rankings. ""Emerging economies continue to lead growth in tourism demand,"" said UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai in a statement. ""The impressive growth of tourism expenditure from China and Russia reflects the entry into the tourism market of a growing middle class from these countries, which will surely continue to change the map of world tourism."" Meanwhile, traditionally hot outbound tourism markets, usually growing at a slower pace, also posted positive results, says the report. Spending on travel abroad from Germany and the United States grew by 6% each. Spending from the UK grew by 4% and the country retained its fourth place spot in the list of major source markets. Expenditure by Canada grew by 7%, while both Australia and Japan grew by 3%. The only markets in the top 10 to record a decline in international tourism spending were France (down 6%) and Italy (minus 1%.) Top international tourism spenders in 2012 . 1.

"(RollingStone.com) -- On May 4, the day Adele turned 26, the multi-platinum singer tweeted, ""Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year."" The tweet seemed to suggest that Adele's much-anticipated follow-up to ""21"" would be arriving at some point in 2014. However, according to the New York Times, that is no longer the case. A financial report from Adele's label XL Recordings reveals that there are no plans to drop an album from the ""Rolling in the Deep"" singer in 2014. Adele's '21' becomes first album to sell over 3 million digital copies . The good news is that XL made $15 million net profit this year, but further down in the report, which the label sent to regulators today, they added this sobering note: ""There will not be a further new release by Adele during 2014 and consequently there will be a fall in XL's turnover and profits. Nevertheless, the directors are confident that by pursuing management policies ... XL will continue to achieve success with other artists."" In the report, the label notes that the singer's back catalogue accounted for a ""significant proportion of the sales and profit"" during 2013. Adele's toddler son wins damages from paparazzi photos . ""21"" sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, so the quiet revelation that 2014 will be Adele-less comes as an equally disappointing update to both XL's distributor Columbia Records and the singer's fans. In a holiday season set to feature big album releases from Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Pink Floyd, Foo Fighters and possibly Kendrick Lamar, Adele's new LP was expected to be the marquee event and a dire shot in the arm for a music industry that has endured record low sales this year. However, as we enter the fourth quarter of 2014, Adele hadn't made any announcements -- she hasn't even tweeted since July -- or rolled out any new singles, which implied that the tentatively titled ""25"" might have to wait until ""26.""

"(CNN) -- Living in a house made from shipping containers isn't exactly everyone's idea of a dream home. But a new design could change all that, building on the ethos of sustainability without cramping your style ... or your space. Eco-Pak distinguishes itself from the container crowd, says its U.S. and British creators, by not only being a structure but also a vehicle for all structural components of the house. Seattle-based architect Matthew Coates and James Green, a British aircraft structural engineer, joined forces just over a year ago to build on Green's original idea for incorporating shipping containers within a bespoke steel shell. The containers form part of the foundation for the building, Green says, as well as being a building block that aids the quick and easy assembly of the frame around it. Coates, who specializes in sustainable design, was familiar with recent innovations in container housing, he says, but Green's idea immediately stood out. ""I think its advantages over traditional housing are quite profound. It's an excellent option for emergency housing -- the containers could be shipped to a site in large quantities, set down and assembled very quickly,"" Coates said. ""The other thing is that it doesn't need a typical foundation. It can actually be put down right on the ground or on concrete blocks or pin piles,"" he said. Coates envisages other markets for Eco-Pak beyond emergency housing, with a two-story house targeted at the affordable housing market and a 1,300 square feet three-story structure retailing for approximately $80-100,000. Robert Kronenburg, professor of architecture at the UK's University of Liverpool and author of ""Houses in Motion: The Genesis, History and Development of the Portable Building,"" says sustainability is ""very, very crucial"" and is driving architectural design more and more. ""Prefabrication is a fantastic way to make things quicker, more economical and improve quality. And trying to find new ways to make affordable housing is obviously important,"" he said. He points to the successes already achieved in this area by New York architectural firm LOT-EK -- one of the pioneers of container housing -- and Jennifer Siegal, founder of the Los Angeles-based Office of Mobile Design. ""What it comes down to in the end is the quality of the system you are creating,"" Kronenburg says, ""how things fit together, how good the parts are, how easy it is to assemble. It's really about practice, testing and making sure it works."" With a patent for the Eco-Pak design granted in May this year, Green and Coates are ready to take their project to the next level. With the help of sponsorship from a U.S. non-profit organization, Coates says a fully functioning prototype is on schedule to be completed by the spring of 2013. ""We intend to sell Eco-Pak internationally,"" Coates said, ""so people could order just the structural parts or a turnkey option -- where we would provide all the exterior wall panels and parts."" Green hopes Eco-Pak will change the ""living in a box"" perception of shipping containers at a price which won't break the bank. ""If you make this thing aesthetically pleasing, people will buy it,"" he says, ""and it promotes the greener side of things.""","New design for container housing aimed at providing emergency shelter and affordable housing .

"(CNN) -- ""What's with all the mixologists these days? ""Why aren't bartenders content just to be called bartenders anymore?"" I frowned as my editor griped about the sanctimonious self-regard of a class of workers once regarded as anonymous service minions (his words), then suggested I do a story on this outrageous barroom development. For a person whose alcohol taste buds aren't refined enough to detect the difference between Cointreau and Grand Marnier, the term slung about by high-minded marketers seems like just another way to suggest 1) intimidating cocktail menus and 2) staggering prices. It might not even be a real word. Type ""mixologist"" into your laptop and you'll see that red squiggly snake beneath it, suggesting that the word doesn't even officially exist. My initial attempt to get to the bottom of the mixologist/bartender question only confuses things further. At The Landmark Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong's annual Masters of Mixology event, I speak with three talented international bartenders. Despite the name of the event they're a part of, each dismisses the term mixologist like it's stale beer. ""I feel very strongly to refer to myself as a bartender,"" says New Yorker Natasha David. From dive bars to nightclubs to high-end bars, David has been pouring drinks for 11 years. In addition to helming Nitecap in New York, she runs a cocktail consulting business, crafting creative cocktail menus for bars. ""I don't think mixologist is a bad term and it does say something nice about creating recipes, but it's more important, relatively, to be welcoming and fun with your guests than to be technically perfect,"" she tells me. ""Bartender trumps mixologist"" In Asia, experienced bartenders tend to consider ""mixologist"" a gimmicky title employed by green bartenders. ""In Korea, bartenders are the ones who make tasty cocktails while mixologists make beautiful ones,"" says Dohwan Eom, owner of Le Chamber in Seoul. Eom was the Diageo World Class Bartender of the Year Runner-up for 2010 for his work at the Ritz Bar at the Ritz-Carlton, Seoul; he's known for infusing food ingredients into his cocktails. ""Bartender trumps mixologist,"" he insists. ""Younger bartenders like to call themselves mixologists nowadays, trying to make their work sound magical,"" adds Takumi Watanabe, a 20-year veteran of the trade, award-winning bartender at the elegant Sailing Bar in Nara, Japan, and considered one of the top bartenders in the country. ""In Japan, people are respected for being in one job for many years, so calling yourself a mixologist doesn't make your customers believe in you."" Watanabe's remarks suggest a generational divide, but it turns out the term ""bartender"" doesn't have to equate to old-fashioned tapster. Watanabe makes me an unforgettable Takumi's Margarita using ume-shu and shiso powder. It's impossible not to trust someone who ""sees making cocktails as a ceremony."" So far everything I've found makes the case for mixologist being a dirty word. That might bring a smug smile to my editor's face. But I know there are plenty of people out there who use the term in a serious and meaningful way. Mixologist actually a classic term . Somebody has to have a kind word for mixologists. I keep digging, pestering every drink pourer I can find. Michael Callahan and Raj Nagra both refer to themselves as ""bartender before a mixologist,"" but neither considers mixologist a snobbish term. ""The term dates as far back as the 1850s, so I think to dismiss it entirely would be forsaking the rich history of our craft,"" says Callahan, founding bartender at 28 HongKong Street in Singapore and former vice president of the Northern California Chapter of the United States Bartenders' Guild (he relocated from San Francisco to Singapore). Callahan's 28 HongKong Street ranked 10th on the World's 50 Best Bars list in 2013 and is nominated as a finalist this year. ""Mixologist has sprung up again over the last decade more aggressively,"" says Nagra, a Global Bombay Sapphire Ambassador and veteran bartender in New York. ""Many aspiring bartenders in this modern age have used the title to gain more press and assist in transforming the consumer idea of what a bartender was and perhaps now might be. ""The media absolutely love the term and use it more than bartenders these days to educate their readership on the evolution of the cocktail industry,"" says Nagra. ""It's become a hype generator, its greatest proponent being marketers. ""In recent years, the term has been abused just as 'punk rock' became a commodity in the '90s. A 'mixologist' is just a person with a whole lot of passion for what they do,"" says Callahan. Well, that sounded like a familiar refrain -- blame the media! Maybe my professional brethren are sometimes suckers for the hype machine, but surely the entire media can't shoulder the blame for the proliferation of mixologists? Where did the term come from before media and marketers went nuts for it? ""Dale DeGroff,"" says Nagra. The man who started it all . ""I'm afraid I have to take the rap for reviving the 19th-century term mixologist,"" says Dale DeGroff, after I reach out for a so-it's-you conversation. Founder of the Museum of the American Cocktail in New Orleans and creator of his own bitters, it was 1987 when DeGroff slipped the term into the cocktail menu at the Rainbow Room in New York. This was at a time when the bar was creating a storm by employing classic recipes and making drinks with real ingredients and fresh juice. ""It was clear that we were doing something no one else was doing and something that hadn't been done for many years,"" says DeGroff. ""I wanted to shine a light on what we were doing at Rainbow ... so I decided to call myself a master mixologist to the press."" A dead word in modern dictionary, he came across the term in a 19th-century bar manual while doing cocktail research. ""It's understandable why 'mixologist' has become a popular moniker; it helps to differentiate the average beer/shot/Flaming Lamborghini bartender from ones who spend their time furthering their knowledge of flavor compounds and the obscure history of the craft,"" says Callahan. ""For me, the term mixologist lends to the idea of crafting creative cocktails, with a heightened understanding of the ingredients within, as potentially opposed to otherwise,"" says Nagra. Ultimately, argue its proponents, the title doesn't have to denote extravagance. ""The idea of creating great drinks is not reserved for anyone in particular and can be presented by way of relatively modest pricing,"" says Nagra, citing the populist cocktail scene in New York as an example. ""One of the things I love most about NYC cocktail bars is that many are operated by amazingly talented people who are modest and happy to educate their customers."" Final verdict . Although most bartenders I speak with don't despise the term itself -- rather they wince at the abuse of it -- I think it's best to leave the verdict to the man who resurrected the noble mixologist. After working as a driver for Zsa Zsa Gabor and pursuing an acting career, DeGroff first landed a job as a waiter and a bartender in the early 1960s. Now 65, DeGroff recalls the moment he rediscovered the now-infamous term and says he saw the rise of its popularity coming. ""Joe Baum, my mentor and the man who many believe was one of the movers in the early days of the culinary, wine, and, through me, the cocktail revolution of the last 40 years, shared his vision with me,"" says DeGroff. ""So yes, I did know we were onto something that would change the scene for decades to come. ""Those decades I spoke of above are just beginning. ""Now that beverage is on a more equal footing with the culinary side of the business, the two will become inseparable -- and I am not just speaking about wine."" DeGroff doesn't mind the flood of self-proclaimed ""mixologists"" in the market, and reminds me of the positive influence the term and the movement have had on the business of bartending. ""The question really is not too much or too little, but good or bad. ""Of course there are a few out there calling themselves 'master mixologists' who don't have the chops to perform at that level, but the market will sort that out quickly,"" says DeGroff. That's a final word on mixologists even my grouchy editor might drink to. Le Chamber, 42 Dosan-daero, 55-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul .

"(CNN) -- Greece is through to the knockout stages of the World Cup for the first time in its history after a dramatic 2-1 win against Ivory Coast in Group C. Georgios Samaras kept a cool head to net from the penalty spot in injury time to seal second place in the group behind Colombia. It was a cruel blow for the Ivorians who were themselves on course to make the knockout stages for the first time after Wilfried Bony scored in the 74th minute. The Swansea City striker had leveled the scores after Andreas Samaris had put the Greeks ahead three minutes before the break. A draw would have been enough for Sabri Lamouchi's side but Greece's persistence paid off when Samaras fired home a spot kick after being brought down by substitute Giovanni Sio in the 91st minute. Victory means Fernando Santos' side finish second in Group C with four points and will now face Group D winners Costa Rica who drew with England 0-0 earlier on Tuesday. Defeat not only brought Ivory Coast's tournament to an end but also the reign of manager Lamouchi who announced he was stepping down shortly after the match. ""I have put a lot of time and effort into the past two years but unfortunately my story with Ivory Coast ends this evening,"" Lamouchi said. ""The outcome is a cruel one but the Greeks did not steal this victory. I am very disappointed and sad and also for the players and the Ivorian people,"" he added. Colombia, meanwhile, will meet Uruguay in Rio on Saturday after confirming top spot in the group with another convincing display. A 4-1 win against Japan in Cuiaba ensured Jose Pekerman's side scored maximum points from their three matches. Juan Cuadrado gave Los Cafeteros the lead in the 17th minute -- firing home from the penalty spot after Yasuyuki Konno had brought down AdriÃ¡n Ramos. Japan drew level on the stroke of halftime when Shinji Okazaki headed home from Keisuke Honda's cross before Colombia ran away with the match in the second half. Jackson Martinez netted on the hour mark after substitute James Rodriguez's neat pass allowed the Porto striker to drill a low shot past goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima. Martinez added a third with eight minutes remaining before Rodriguez banged in a fourth in the last minute of the match. Colombia's will have to wait to see if Uruguay, who claimed second spot in Group D after beating Italy 1-0, will be fielding Luis Suarez. The mercurial striker was once again in the spotlight for the wrong reasons after appearing to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the match in Natal. The incident, which happened moments before Uruguay scored the winning goal, was not seen by the referee but is being investigated by FIFA. Read more: Luis Suarez embroiled in new 'biting' storm .

"(CNN) -- A small plane with an unresponsive pilot sank in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday after circling above the ocean for more than two hours, then crashing, the U.S. Coast Guard reported. The twin-engine Cessna 421 remained afloat with its tail sticking out of the water for some time before it sank Thursday afternoon, said Petty Officer Elizabeth Bordelon, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. No remains have been found, and the Coast Guard still considered its operation an active search and rescue. There was no sign of the pilot, Bordelon said. The plane went down about about 120 miles west of Tampa, Florida, at 12:08 p.m. after circling the eastern Gulf for more than two hours, said Chief Petty Officer John Edwards, a Coast Guard spokesman. The crew of a Coast Guard search-and-rescue plane watched as the Cessna made what appeared to be a soft landing, Edwards said. A Coast Guard plane from the Tampa area and the cutter Coho were still taking part in the search Thursday evening, and the Coho was expected to remain at the scene overnight, Bordelon said. The plane took off from Slidell, Louisiana, en route to Sarasota, Florida, with a single pilot on board. It had been circling at an altitude of about 28,000 feet, a Federal Aviation Administration source told CNN. The Air Force began monitoring the plane after noticing it flying erratically over the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday morning, and planes sent up to investigate it reported the Cessna's windows were either iced or fogged over, Edwards said. Pilots at the Slidell Municipal Airport said the victim was Dr. Peter Hertzak, a cosmetic surgeon who was well known in the area. ""I've lost a dear friend, just a great guy,"" pilot Bill Huete told CNN affiliate WWL-TV. ""Super doctor and just a regular guy that would do anything for anybody."" Hertzak was the head of the Hertzak Laser Center, which specializes in liposuction and cosmetic surgery. He had more than 30 years of experience, according to the center's website. The Coast Guard plane and two F-15s from the North American Aerospace Defense Command were still watching the Cessna before it went down, the Air Force and Coast Guard reported. The Coast Guard said an investigation was under way. But aviation expert Miles O'Brien told CNN the circumstances point toward a possible loss of cabin pressure in the eight-seat, propeller-driven aircraft. ""At 28,000 feet, you don't have an awful lot of useful consciousness without the support of oxygen or being in a pressurized aircraft,"" said O'Brien, a former CNN correspondent. If a lone pilot is incapacitated at that altitude, ""there aren't a lot of options for resuscitating him and getting him back flying."" Fellow pilot Patrick Quigley told WWL that Hertzak maintained his plane meticulously and spared no expense to keep it in ""tip-top shape."" Quigley said Hertzak was an accomplished pilot and that the flight should have been routine, ""but when something goes wrong, obviously you have nowhere to go when you're out over the ocean."" In 1999, a private jet carrying golfer Payne Stewart and five others crashed after apparently losing cabin pressure ""for undetermined reasons"" after takeoff from Florida, the National Transportation Safety Board found. Fighter pilots were sent up to intercept Stewart's plane after controllers lost contact with it, and they reported its cockpit and cabin windows were frosted over. The plane flew more than halfway across the United States, apparently on autopilot, until it crashed in a South Dakota field. CNN's Dave Alsup, Rick Martin, Devon Sayers, Aaron Cooper, Todd Spoerry, and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Friends identify the pilot as a well known cosmetic surgeon in the area .

"Santa Monica, California (CNN) -- A new, high-definition Kindle with a lighting system and a bigger Kindle Fire tablet topped the list of gadgets rolled out by Amazon on Thursday at a splashy event in an aircraft hangar. ""We love to invent. We love to pioneer. We even like going down alleys that turn out to be blind alleys,"" CEO Jeff Bezos told reporters and other guests. ""Every once in a while those blind alleys turn into broad avenues. And that turns out to be lots of fun."" The Kindle Paperwhite e-reader will feature 62 percent more pixels than the Kindle Touch, Bezos said. It will have a touchscreen and be lit with a fiber-optic lighting system that has been in development for four years, he said. Bezos predicted users will ""leave the light on all the time"" and said the device will have eight weeks of battery life, even with its light on. It's slightly thinner than the Kindle Touch and, at 7.6 ounces, the same weight. A new feature called Time to Read will estimate, based on the reader's speed turning pages, how long it will take to finish the current chapter or the entire book. The Wi-Fi-only version will cost $119 and 3G versions will be $179. The WiFi-only model is $20 less than Barnes & Noble's rival Nook Glowlight, priced at $139. Pre-orders began Thursday and the device ships on October 1. The original style, non-touchscreen Kindle also will remain available, with its price dropping to $69 for the ad-supported version. Bezos also rolled out new Kindle Fires: a new version of the current tablet, which he says is 40 percent faster and has a longer battery life; and two sizes of a fancier Kindle Fire HD. The Fire HDs will have either a 7-inch or an 8.9-inch screen. The big one is nearly two inches bigger than the current Fire's 7-inch display and slightly smaller than the iPad's 9.7-inch screen. The Fire HD, which will continue to run a modified version of Google's Android operating system, features dual stereo speakers with Dolby Digital Plus and two antennas, which Bezos said will lead to better connections. It will feature new gaming tools, including an app that lets parents limit the amount of time their kids can spend playing. They'll have Bluetooth connectivity and an HDMI port. The 7-inch Fire HD will cost $199 and the 8.9-inch version, with 16GB, will go for $299. The 7-inch ships September 14 and the 8.9-inch on November 20. The updated Kindle Fire will sell for $159 and ship on September 14. And as a parting note reminiscent of late Apple CEO Steve Jobs' ""one more thing,"" Bezos announced that they'll be offering a 32GB version of the 8.9-inch Fire with 4G LTE connectivity. That price is significantly lower than a 3G iPad with 32GB ($729), but its data plan, at an affordable $49 a year, only includes 250 MB of data per month. More technology: Ready for iPhone 5? Amazon's event is just one of many product announcements this month from electronics companies hoping to build hype ahead of the holidays. Nokia and Motorola announced new smartphones on Wednesday, and HTC is planning an event for September 19. The tech companies also are battling to make an impression in the shadow of Apple's big press conference next Wednesday, which is most likely for the newest iPhone. Rumors and leaks had been plentiful ahead of the Amazon event, with all signs pointing to an array of new Kindles. The Kindle Touch and Kindle Touch 3G were recently listed as ""Currently Unavailable"" on Amazon.com, and last Thursday the Internet retailer claimed the $199 Kindle Fire had sold out, nine months after it went on sale. Bezos has called the original Kindle Fire Amazon's most successful product launch and, in a press release last week, said it accounts for 22% of tablet sales in the United States. CNNMoney: With iPad Mini on the way, does Kindle Fire 2 matter? The company has not released any sales numbers for the device to support this statistic, but research firm IDC says the company had 4.8% of the global market share in the second quarter this year. Since the Kindle Fire is only sold in the States, that percentage is likely higher in this country. The 7-inch Kindle Fire debuted a year ago at $199. It wasÂ met with lukewarm reviews but was still a hit with consumers looking for an affordable alternative to the $499-and-up iPad.Â Early complaints focused on many small design issues, such as the lack of external volume buttons, no video output and a poorly placed power button. Performance was also a problem, with sluggish Web browsing and video playback speeds.Â . Meanwhile, the tablet market is filling up with options from major manufacturers. At the moment, it's still dominated by Apple, which released a refreshed iPad in March and had a 62% global tablet market share in the second quarter. The company is expected to announce a new, smaller version of the iPad in October. More technology: Amazon launches new game studio . Other new tablets include Microsoft's Surface tablet, running the new Windows 8 operating system, which will go on sale October 26. Google released its own 7-inch tablet this summer, the $199 Nexus 7, and is pushing it hard, even giving it a coveted ad spot on the Google.com homepage. They join Samsung's Galaxy line as well as the Barnes & Noble Nook and BlackBerry PlayBook, both $199. While all tablets have differences in hardware design, performance and price, a bigger factor may turn out to be access to music, books, movies and television shows. Amazon has a head start in this department. This week, the company announced a new partnership with Epix, which will bring blockbusters such as ""The Avengers"" to Amazon Prime, the company's $79-a-year instant-streaming service.","Kindle Paperwhite e-reader will feature a touchscreen and a fiber-optic lighting system .

"London, England (CNN) -- ""Some people believe football is a matter of life and death... I assure you it is much, much more important than that."" As Bill Shankly, the legendary former manager of English club Liverpool, pointed out shortly before he passed away in 1981, the significance of the beautiful game can never be underestimated -- and that doesn't just apply to fans of the sport, either. Soccer can affect lives on a national and international scale, inspiring revolutions and causing wars as well as having the capability to create peace and lift entire nations. The ""Football War"" between Honduras and El Salvador in 1969 is perhaps the most famous example of the sport's wider implications. The two Central American nations famously came to blows following their qualification match for the 1970 World Cup. Pedro Pinto's World Cup predictions . But this wasn't the first time, and definitely won't be the last, that the worlds of football and politics collide with remarkable results. 1. Mussolini manipulates the ""man in black,"" 1934 . ""Il Duce"" was determined to use this World Cup on home soil to showcase his fascist Italy. Mussolini had his own trophy created for the event -- the Coppa Del Duce -- which was six times the size of the Jules Rimet, and to this day allegations remain the tournament was fixed so that only Italy would collect it. According to the BBC's ""World Cup Stories"" book by Chris Hunt, there were suggestions that the Italian dictator himself picked the referees. In the semifinal against Austria, Mussolini's Azzurri team won 2-1, but after the game their opponents complained the game was fixed. The World Cup's missing men . ""The referee even played for them,"" said Austrian striker Josef Bican. ""When I passed for the ball out to the right wing, one of our players, Cicek, ran for it and the referee headed it back to the Italians. It was unbelievable."" 2. Austrian star humiliates Nazis, 1938 . Austria had one of the game's greatest sides in the 1930s, but when the Nazis annexed their neighbors, the nation's ""Wunderteam"" were forced to withdraw from the World Cup and merge with Germany. Star striker Matthias Sindelar so opposed his nation's loss of independence that he refused to play for Germany. He pleaded old age, but Germany's manager Sepp Herberger would later recall: ""I almost had the impression that discomfort and rejection, linked to the political developments, had prompted his refusal."" Who will be the World Cup's best player? During a so-called ""Reconciliation Game"" to mark the merging of the two sides, Sindelar made his feelings quite clear in a 2-0 win for Austria. According to German historian Nils Havemann's book ""Fussball unterm Hakenkreuz,"" the center-forward scored his beloved country's first and then, when the second goal went in, he danced in celebration in front of Nazi officials. In 1939, Sindelar and his girlfriend were killed in his apartment by a gas leak. Controversy still reigns over whether it was murder or suicide -- or just an accident. 3. Algerians play for independence, 1958 . Halfway through Algeria's War of Independence, the French national team called up a handful of Algerians playing in the French soccer league for the World Cup in Sweden. Given the chance of glory, fame and fortune, the players chose national identity instead. Rather than attend a pre-tournament friendly against Switzerland, they decided to flee France, gather at the headquarters of the Front Liberation National in Tunisia and launch an ""illegal"" national team, risking arrest for desertion in the process. Who will win the World Cup? Rachid Maflouki had won the French championship with Saint Etienne before getting the call from Les Bleus, but decided there were more important matters at stake than his personal success. ""I didn't hesitate,"" he told Ian Hawkey, author of ""Feet of the Chameleon."" ""Okay, I would have to give up my club. And yes, I was thinking about the World Cup, but what did that count for in comparison with my country's independence?"" 4. Zaire players crack under Presidential pressure, 1974 . It's remembered as one of the World Cup's funniest moments, but the truth is much darker. Already 3-0 down and facing a Brazilian free-kick, Zaire's right-back Ilunga Mwepu seemingly forgot the rules of the game, charged at the ball and hoofed it away before the whistle had even been blown. The Leopards, the first sub-Saharan African nation to reach the finals, had already been humiliated 9-0 by Yugoslavia before losing 2-0 to Scotland, and were told by President Mobutu's henchmen that if they lost to Brazil by more than three goals they wouldn't be allowed to return home. Ten World Cup headlines yet to be written . ""Do you think I'd deliberately make myself look like an idiot? You have to remember we were playing for our lives,"" he said in the book ""Death or Glory, the Dark History of the World Cup"" by Jon Spurling. Mwepu's act of ""madness,"" it turns out, was in fact a very sane attempt to waste time. 5. The German nation divided, 1974 . East Germany versus West at the 1974 World Cup was perhaps the most politically-charged match of all time. After the Second World War, the divided nation had become the main arena for the Cold War, and this fixture in Hamburg represented a head-to-head between the two ideologies. Although the game was actually the last in the group and it had become clear that both teams would qualify from the group stage, that did not diminish the tension surrounding the clash. Ten shocking World Cup moments . With home advantage, European champions West Germany were favorites but it was the East German Jurgen Sparwasser who scored the only goal of the game. East Germany heralded their triumph, but the victory was rendered a little hollow after they were knocked out in the next round and their bitter rivals went on to win the tournament. 6. Argentine junta swaps grain for glory, 1978 . Argentina's junta, which had seized power just a couple of years earlier, was determined to use the World Cup it was hosting as propaganda for the regime. According to a 1986 article by journalist Maria Laura Avignolo of Britain's Sunday Times, and supported by David Yallop in his book ""How They Stole the Game,"" the junta used bribery and intimidation to help win the cup. Controversy over new World Cup ball . In the group stages, Argentina needed to beat Peru by four goals in their last game to progress. General Jorge Videla made a timely pre-match visit to the Peruvian dressing-room to talk to the players about ""Latin American unity"" before the host nation rattled six past a side that had previously held eventual finalists Holland to a goalless draw. Avignolo claimed that in the weeks following the Peru game, an impromptu cargo of 35,000 tonnes of wheat left Argentina for Lima and that the military regime issued an interest-free loan of $50 million to the Peruvian government. 7. Iran's football revolution, 1998 . They may have been two of the least significant footballing sides at France '98, but nevertheless this fixture caught the world's imagination because Iran and the United States had been at loggerheads since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Although political relations were strained, the clash of civilizations never quite happened on the pitch. Instead, both sides showed the utmost respect, swapping flowers, gifts and photographs before the kick-off. The Iranians won 2-1, but, celebrations back home had a destabilizing effect as hundreds of thousands of young people, including women, partied in the streets in defiance of government warnings. ""In my neighborhood everybody goes out into the streets,"" one young Iranian told the BBC's Jim Muir. ""It's a good excuse for boys and girls to mix, and in a way it's political, because it's a demand for social change."" 8. Germany enjoys ""Partyotism,"" 2006 . The tournament slogan ""A time to make friends"" pretty much said it all. The organizers of Germany 2006 set out to woo the world, and in the process the country learned to love themselves. A combination of a flawless summer and coach Jurgen Klinsmann's flee-flowing football injected a feel-good factor back into the national psyche, and Germans realized they could enjoy patriotism again -- or as the local media billed it, ""partyotism."" ""In the space of one month, Klinsmann managed to bring together a society ashamed of displays of nationalism and still divided along East-West lines, turning Germany into a nation of face-painting, flag-waving patriots,"" Hunt said in his ""World Cup Stories"" book. ""Never mind the final,"" Britain's The Times newspaper wrote. ""Germans are the real World Cup winners."" 9. The Koreas refuse to play nicely, 2008 . North and South Korea both successfully managed to qualify for South Africa 2010, but there were plenty of bad-tempered squabbles along the way. The bickering got so bad that world governing body FIFA eventually had to intervene after North Korea announced it would not let the South play its national anthem or wave its flag on their territory. So determined were the North Koreans that they were even prepared to play their ""home"" game abroad. In the end, the fixture took place in Shanghai, where the North Korean coach complained that their rivals had poisoned their food. In a statement about the match, the North's football association said: ""It was beyond all doubt that the incident was a product of a deliberate act perpetrated by adulterated foodstuff as [the players] could not get up all of a sudden just before the match."" According to a report by the BBC, the South's soccer federation -- Korea Football Association -- said a sports doctor had examined the North Korean players and found no serious problem. 10. Football diplomacy between old enemies, 2008-09 . Serious sport is war minus the shooting, remarked English author George Orwell. So it was refreshing last year when Armenia and Turkey used the beautiful game to make peace. The leaders of the two countries met up to watch a World Cup qualifier between their nations after almost a century of bitterness following the killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by Turks during World War One. Turkish President Abdullah Gul attended the initial game in Armenia in 2008, which the hosts lost 2-0, and his counterpart Serzh Sarkisian agreed to join him for the return fixture the following year for further thawing of diplomatic relations. No doubt the fact that neither side had a chance of qualifying for South Africa helped keep things civil.","Argentina's right-wing junta allegedly bribed Peru with grain and a $50M loan in 1978 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed landmark legislation Monday giving the Food and Drug Administration new power to regulate the manufacturing, marketing and sale of tobacco. President Obama says the new law ""represents change that's been decades in the making."" The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gives the FDA power to ban candy-flavored and fruit-flavored cigarettes, widely considered appealing to first-time smokers, including youths. It also prohibits tobacco companies from using terms such as ""low tar,"" ""light"" or ""mild,"" requires larger warning labels on packages, and restricts advertising of tobacco products. It also requires tobacco companies to reduce levels of nicotine in cigarettes. The new law ""represents change that's been decades in the making,"" Obama said during a bill-signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. ""The decades-long effort to protect our children [has] emerged victorious. ... Today, change has come."" Despite a significant decrease in the percentage of Americans who smoke in recent decades, more than 400,000 Americans still die from tobacco-related illnesses every year, the president noted. Tobacco-related health care costs exceed $100 billion annually. Altria Group, which owns Philip Morris USA, the nation's biggest cigarette company, previously called congressional passage of the law ""an important step forward."" At the same time, however, it also expressed ""First Amendment reservations about certain provisions, including those that could restrict a manufacturer's ability to communicate truthful information to adult consumers about tobacco products."" Phillip Morris makes such brands as Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Chesterfield and Basic. A narrow majority of adult Americans opposes the law, according to a Gallup Poll released Monday. Fifty-two percent of Americans -- including most smokers -- are opposed to the measure, while 46 percent support it. The survey was conducted June 14-17. Before signing the bill, the president acknowledged the struggle that young people in particular face when they try to stop smoking. ""I know because I was one of those teenagers. I know how difficult it can be when you get started at a young age,"" he said.","Law gives FDA power to ban candy-flavored and fruit-flavored cigarettes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Cell phones and pagers, airplane engines, a door from a police squad car, a mother's wallet and credit cards. Those items survived when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks. The Newseum in Washington, D.C., is expanding its FBI exhibit with a new display of artifacts from 9/11 and other terrorist plots that have never been on display to the public before. ""War on Terror: The FBI's New Focus"" will open Friday in plenty of time for the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The Newseum selected 60 pieces of evidence the FBI had in storage for use in terror trials, including huge pieces of an airplane that survived ramming into the World Trade Center towers. ""I think the most powerful pieces here are the most personal,"" said Cathy Trost, director of exhibit development at the Newseum. ""The things that people put in their pockets that morning not knowing that this was going to be a day that changed their lives forever."" Perhaps the most heart-wrenching items on display belonged to Ruth McCourt of New London, Connecticut. McCourt was taking her 4-year-old daughter, Juliana, to visit Disneyland. They were aboard United Flight 175, which was the second plane to hit the World Trade Center. McCourt's wallet was found in the debris, battered but still intact. It's on display along with three credit cards. A picture of McCourt and Juliana at the beach is also shown. ""A lot of family members want to make sure there are public displays because they don't want people to forget what they lost that day,"" said Susan Bennett, a Newseum senior vice president. A sampling of the many cell phones and pagers are part of the exhibit. ""It's so sad because the families, the colleagues of the people who were in the World Trade Center didn't give up,"" Bennett said. ""They kept trying to call, and call, and call again with just a glimmer of hope that somehow perhaps the people were still buried underneath the rubble or had perhaps been taken to a hospital. It was very emotional for the rescue workers because they could hear the cell phones ringing."" Pictures of the 19 hijackers are also on display along with some of their passports. A seating plan for one of the flights shows where leader Mohamed Atta and his co-conspirators were sitting, and a letter all the hijackers left behind is included.

Trost said Newseum staff interviewed dozens of FBI agents, journalists and experts on the 9/11 attacks to provide a full picture of what happened that day and the FBI investigation that followed. ""The story was not only the investigation, but also how it changed the FBI forever,"" Trost said. ""The big priority after 9/11 was stop the next attack."" Dan McCarron, a FBI public affairs person who worked with the Newseum on the project, agrees. ""There's a theme in the stories of how the FBI's changed. We're more of a national security organization, threat-based intelligence,"" he said. ""And we want to prevent. And the way you prevent is you got to predict. So now that is our mindset."" A key terror plot also shown involves British citizen Richard Reid, known as the shoe bomber. Reid got on board a flight from Paris headed to Miami just days before Christmas in 2001. He was discovered trying to ignite his hiking shoe, containing explosives that government investigators said could have brought down the plane. Flight crew members and fellow passengers tackled and restrained a struggling Reid. Tourists will be able to see his shoes, the clothes he was wearing, the matches he used and the remains of drugs used to sedate him after he was caught. People will also be able to see several heavy leather belts passengers and crew members used to fashion restraints for the powerfully built, 6-foot, 4-inch Reid. McCarron pointed to the Reid case as something that showed al Qaeda was able to change tactics by using a single operative with a bomb instead of teams, which were used in the 9/11 attacks. And the U.S. had to react to Reid's mode of attack to prevent another. ""The impact of that case is now in airports,"" McCarron said. ""Everyone takes their shoes off.""","Newseum expands its FBI exhibit to show fight against terror .

"(CNN) -- In male-dominated Saudi Arabia, women long have lacked a seat at the table of power. That harsh reality was reflected in an Ikea furniture catalog distributed in Saudi Arabia that left them missing from other tables as well. Images of women were airbrushed from copies of the Swedish-based retailer's annual catalog shipped to the religiously conservative Islamic kingdom. Saudi Arabia turns back 1,000 female pilgrims from Nigeria . For example, one photo in the publication showed a mother, father and two children in a bathroom. In the Saudi version, the image of the woman was removed. The news, first reported by Sweden's Metro newspaper, nearly made Sweden's trade minister, Ewa Bjorling, fall off her chair -- or throw one. ""I regret that there is still such a long way to go when it comes to gender equality in Saudi Arabia, which these images clearly show,"" she said. Saudi princess opens up about women's rights in her country . ""As long as women are hindered from visibility and work outside home, Saudi Arabia will lack 50% of their human capital."" IKEA apologized Monday for the airbrushing, saying it ""regrets what has happened and understands that people are upset."" ""It is not the local franchisee that has requested the retouch of the discussed pictures. The mistake happened during the work process occurring before presenting the draft catalog for IKEA Saudi Arabia. We take full responsibility for the mistakes made,"" the company said. Attaining equal rights has been an uphill battle for Saudi women. Saudi Arabia let women compete in Olympics for first time . There's been a ""push to get women into the workforce, which religious conservatives are fiercely resisting,"" Human Rights Watch said in an August report. But women are up against a ""different but equal"" notion of gender equality in Islam. ""Men have a duty to provide for women, women in turn must obey their male guardians and care for house and children,"" the rights group noted, citing a 2003 scholarly treatise. The IKEA airbrushing didn't faze Eman Al Nafjan, writer and blogger who tweets as Saudiwoman. ""We're beyond that right now in Saudi Arabia,"" she told CNN. ""With Internet and satellite TV, there's really no such thing anymore as blacking out women or airbrushing out women. I would be upset if something like Google was doing it, but for IKEA to do it, that's just marketing -- it's not such a big deal."" Images in international magazines had been customarily censored. But times seem to have changed a bit, she said. A year ago, for example, the shoulders and stomachs in the images of women in tube tops would be colored with a marker. ""They would go through each individual magazine with a black marker and color in any skin that was showing or tear out pages,"" she said. ""Now they don't. It's strange -- almost like they gave up. I saw a woman wearing a miniskirt on the cover of a magazine when I was at the grocery store,"" she said. Just the same, she said, censored images are not unusual. ""I don't think it's right, but it's the culture. Even women who wear the hijab who appear in street advertising posters -- you see that their faces are pixelated and blurred.""

"(CNN) -- Celebrities and their bodies. We're obsessed. They're obsessed. And it spills over to how many people feel about themselves. But how much concern over weight gain is about vanity and how much is about critical health issues? Kathy Ireland says she's more concerned about what weight gain does to her health than her appearance. On Monday's ""Larry King Live,"" Kathy Ireland and Bob Greene joined Larry to talk about the subject, prompted by Kirstie Alley's well-publicized battle with weight. Ireland is a former supermodel and actress and has had her own weight issues. Greene is Oprah Winfrey's personal trainer. The interview picks up here after King plays a clip from Alley's appearance on the show last week. In the clip, Alley says her weight gain was ""humiliating. I think the biggest, most painful thing for me is I have all these people I inspired and then I let them down.""  Watch Alley discuss weight gain » . Larry King: Are we overly involved with this topic, Kathy? Kathy Ireland: Well, I think we are for the wrong reasons. And I think there is such an obsession with appearance. With my weight gain, people wanted to know, well, when is she going to squeeze back into a bikini? No. That is not what it's about. But what people weren't asking me, what's the triglyceride level? What is the C reactive protein? Larry, with your foundation and what you are doing to make heart health at the forefront of everyone's mind, and Bob with your information about healthy living, it is so important. Heart disease is the number one killer of women in America. King: We're not just talking aesthetics? Bob Greene: No, we're not. We run into problems any time we think weight is the problem. Weight is a symptom of something that needs to change in your life. King: Kathy, you [were an] internationally famous swimsuit model, and then you gained weight, right? Ireland: The weight gain was gradual, about a pound a year for the past 25 years. I intentionally built a business that has absolutely nothing to do with my appearance. So I would think what does it matter? My food choices. Well, what matters is what am I doing to my health? And I encourage people -- you know, please don't put it off. Every mom I know has a to-do list. Put yourself on that to-do list. Call your doctor tomorrow. Get an appointment. Find out what is the health of your heart. King: Is fluctuating weight like Kirstie Alley bad, Bob? Greene: Well, there's two sides to that story. First off, if you remain heavy, that's when the most damage is done to your heart and the excessive health ramifications from keeping overweight. So as long as you're watching, even if it's yo-yo dieting, that's healthier than the person that remains heavy. However, the best thing is to live the lifestyle of moving more and eating less and pursuing what it is that got you there in the first place. King: By the way, Bob's posted an exclusive commentary for our blog. Read Bob Greene's blog on CNN. Let's take another look at a clip of Kirstie Alley talking with Oprah about her weight struggles. [video clip begins] Alley: And then when I gained weight the last time and lost it, I honest to God thought, this is it. This will be the last time I ever do this again. Winfrey: Yes. And now you know differently. But you knew because you had all that exercise equipment in your house, remember? We went to your house, and there was all the exercise equipment in the living room. Alley: And I moved it out and made it a dining room. [video clip ends] . King: That's Kirstie sort of making fun of this, don't you think? Ireland: I appreciate her honesty and her openness. And Oprah, she has let us know that there's no shame in a weight gain. With the picture that our son took of me, I was tempted to push the delete button. But, you know, beautiful people come in all shapes and sizes, ages and colors. But we've got to get the message out about health. What kind of message is that sending to our children? King: Kathy, are we getting better? Ireland: I hope we're getting better. I pray we're getting better. We've got to teach our children. We've got to get the message out there for women, don't beat yourself up. But please be healthy. Don't put off your health. It's too important. King: Do you notice more interest? Greene: I see more interest in the foods we eat, but I see less interest in moving more, which is at least one-third of the problem, and even less interest in resolving the things in our life that drive us to the refrigerator. King: This is not purely American, is it? Or is it? Greene: No, it's starting to shift over into Australia, New Zealand, overseas. So it's not uniquely American.","Ex-model Kathy Ireland: Quit worrying about image, start taking care of your heart .

"(CNN) -- Ever since Myo's head was smashed into a block of ice he's had trouble hearing. The Burmese man, whose name has been changed for his safety, was on a fishing boat in Thailand last year when it happened. He had left Myanmar, also known as Burma, thinking he was going to work in a factory processing pineapple. But when he arrived in Thailand, he says, his recruiters sold him to a boat captain for the equivalent of around $430. After being held on the vessel for 10 months, working against his will and suffering regular beatings, he finally managed to escape. Myo's story features in the United States' latest report on countries efforts to fight modern slavery around the world. It echoes numerous other accounts told by trafficking survivors to international media and human rights groups in Thailand in recent years. Many are foreign migrants who report being forced into labor or prostitution; some face physical abuse or even death. The lucky ones escape or know someone who can pay the exorbitant price for their release. For four years the U.S. State Department has warned Thailand that it hasn't been doing enough to combat human trafficking. It said the country was a source, transit point and destination for trafficking, with ethnic minorities and citizens of neighboring countries at particular risk of exploitation in the sex trade and forced labor. In the State Department's 2012 and 2013 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, Thailand faced relegation to the worst category, but received waivers based on a plan to bring itself into compliance with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking. On Friday, when the State Department released its 2014 report, it automatically downgraded Thailand to the lowest possible ranking, after the country reached its limit of waivers and failed to show significant improvement. Now, the Southeast Asian nation shares the ""Tier 3"" category with 22 other countries, putting it on par with the likes of North Korea, Syria and the Central African Republic. Sihasak Phuangketkheow, the permanent secretary to Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called the move ""a great disappointment."" ""I do know that Thailand has been doing much better than those countries in that category,"" he said. ""So I ask U.S. whether Thailand should be in that category."" Sihasak said Thailand will continue efforts to tackle this problem. The downgrade means Thailand could see the withdrawal of non-humanitarian U.S. assistance, and its opposition to funding from international institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Although anti-trafficking advocates, like the Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking, believe the U.S. is unlikely to impose such sanctions in practice to preserve security, and economic ties between the two nations. Progress? Thai authorities acknowledge there is a problem. ""Human trafficking is one of the worst forms of human indignity and Thailand is committed to eliminating this inhumane exploitation,"" the Thai Ambassador to the United States, Vijavat Isarabhakdi, said in a recent press statement. But he insisted significant progress has been made in tackling the issue, and that efforts made in 2013 exceeded the State Department's criteria for an upgrade. ""We're not doing it just because it might impact our trade ... we think that it's a scourge that needs to be eradicated in Thailand and other countries,"" Isarabhakdi told CNN. He pointed to the number of trafficking convictions -- 225 defendants were convicted in 2013, over four times more than the previous year. The government took legal action against more than 150 illegal labor recruitment companies for alleged corruption, forced labor, human trafficking and smuggling. The police carried out over 28,000 police inspections in workplaces suspected of being used for commercial sex and forced labor, he said. ""So in total, I think that we've been doing a lot, but we acknowledge the fact that much more needs to be done,"" he added. Yet Thailand's law enforcement efforts remain ""insufficient"" compared to the size of the issue, the State Department said. ""In Thailand, we have a lot of beginnings that will hopefully come to fruition, but the report doesn't look at promises, it looks at results,"" said Luis CdeBaca, the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. ""In this coming year, we hope we'll see success with the new round of cases that there have been some arrests in. We're seeing some good numbers from police, but what happens when the prosecutors get the cases? What happened when the judges hear the cases?"" Prostitution, slavery at sea . Two of the biggest areas of concern are sex trafficking, and forced labor, especially in the fishing industry. The majority of Thai victims identified during 2013 were found in the country's billion dollar sex industry, according to the State Department. The exact number of women and children exploited through prostitution in Thailand is unknown, but estimates from researchers and non-profit groups put the figure in the tens of thousands. Victims are subject to sex trafficking in venues that cater to local demand, along with establishments in tourist hubs like Bangkok and Chiang Mai that cater to foreigners, the State Department said. Thailand is also the world's third-largest exporter of seafood. A 2013 study published by the U.N.'s International Labor Organization (ILO) found that 17% of around 600 fishermen in Thailand said they worked against their will and were unable to leave for threat of financial penalties, the threat of violence or being reporting to authorities. Around six in 10 migrants who had been forced to work on Thai fishing boats said they had seen the murder of another worker, according to a 2009 survey from the U.N. Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking. Corruption . According to the State Department, Thailand's efforts to address trafficking are being hampered by ""corruption at all levels."" Some corrupt officials have even protected brothels and food processing facilities from raids and inspections, the TIP report said. Police officers at the local and national level, who had been assigned to regions notorious for trafficking, formed protective relationships with traffickers. Immigration officials and police have allegedly sold migrants who were unable to pay labor brokers and sex traffickers, according to the report. ""There are cases of suspected corruption, and in all the cases, investigations have been or are being carried out,"" Ambassador Isarabhakdi said. ""At least 33 police officers and also five high-ranking police officials were, or are being, punished under the civil or criminal processes. So many of the cases are still in the process but many have been punished already."" The State Department acknowledged Thailand has improved its system for collecting anti-trafficking data, but says authorities have demonstrated little effort in addressing reports of debt bondage among foreign migrants in commercial sectors, and have not made ""sufficient efforts"" to proactively identify trafficking victims. It also warned that the use of harsh criminal defamation laws to prosecute those who researched or reported on trafficking ""may have discouraged efforts"" to combat the practice. Rohingya asylum seekers . One particular area of concern, according to the State Department, are reports of trafficking of Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority -- many of whom have fled ethnic and religious violence in the country in recent years and pass through neighboring countries, including Thailand. They are among those most vulnerable to being trafficked, the State Department says. ""We're concerned about the Rohingya -- the refugees and asylum seekers. We are concerned that some of them have been subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor,"" said CdeBaca. ""We want the Thai government to investigate and duly address those things."" But when Thailand submitted its 2013 trafficking data to the United States for the Trafficking in Persons project in March, officials said they found no evidence that Rohingya were victims of trafficking, because their transit through Thailand was voluntary. This conflicted with reports from local NGOs and media groups: At least 40,000 ethnic Rohingya and Bangladeshis passed through trafficking camps in Thailand in 2013, according to Chris Lewa, director of the human rights group, the Arakan Project. Although she points out that it's a rough estimate because it's difficult to trace every single migrant boat. On Friday, the Thai Ambassador to the U.S. told CNN that while most of the Rohingya cases involved willful smuggling, towards the end of the reporting period, December 2013, there were cases of trafficking also. ""Those cases are being investigated and will be dealt with in next year's report I'm sure,"" he said. Thailand is not alone in struggling to demonstrate it is serious about fighting trafficking. Malaysia, its southern neighbor, has also been downgraded to Tier 3 in this year's report, and all other nations it shares borders with remain on the State Department's watch list. Countries like Thailand and Malaysia will need to show ""results"" if they want to get off the State Department's list next year, CdeBaca said. CNN's Leif Coorlim contributed to this report.","U.S. says Thailand isn't doing enough to fight human trafficking .

"(CNN) -- One of the areas in which President Obama has held a consistent lead in polls over Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is in the handling of foreign affairs. Although the killing of Osama bin Laden surely factors into this, Obama's advantage stems from progress on his signature promises to bring the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan and reduce America's oversized, and overly costly, military footprint in the world. Although the recent attacks on U.S. diplomatic compounds in the Middle East might have offered Romney an opportunity to broach foreign policy issues, the tensions only underscore the appeal of Obama's foreign policy to a war-weary public: ""After a decade of war, the nation we need to be rebuilding is the United States of America,"" he said in an address last month at Fort Bliss, Texas. Even Romney, who has been harshly critical of the president's foreign policy leadership, seems unwilling to contest this political reality; he omitted any mention of Iraq or Afghanistan in his acceptance speech last month in Tampa, Florida. But the question is not whether promises to bring home troops and reduce military spending can be sold in an election year -- the question is what impact would retrenchment have on future U.S. and global security. If history is any guide, the answer is troubling: Over the past century, each of America's attempts to reduce its role in the world was met by rising global threats, eventually requiring a major U.S. re-engagement. This is not to argue that the U.S. should sustain its muscular post-9/11 global posture or continue its land war in Afghanistan. It is to urge caution against a growing belief that scaling back American power in the world will be without risks or costs. History shows that in the aftermath of America's major wars of the 20th century -- World War I, World War II and Vietnam -- the American public and powerful leaders in Washington demanded strict new limits in foreign policy. After World War I, that meant rejecting participation in the League of Nations and receding into isolation. After World War II, it meant embarking on one of the largest voluntary military demobilizations in world history. And after Vietnam, it meant placing new restrictions on a president's ability to conduct overseas operations. But in each case, hopes were soon dashed by global challengers who took advantage of America's effort to draw back from the world stage -- Germany and Japan in the 1930s, the Soviet Union in the immediate post-World War II period and the Soviet Union again after Vietnam. In each case, the United States was forced back into a paramount global leadership role -- in World War II, the Cold War and the military build-up and proxy wars of the 1980s. Similar effects have also followed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from global hot spots, as in Somalia in 1993. America's need to extricate itself from that calamitous humanitarian mission, in which 18 U.S. soldiers were killed, was clear. But the withdrawal came at a huge strategic cost: It emboldened the narrative of the emerging al Qaeda network that America was a ""paper tiger,"" setting the stage for the escalating terrorist attacks of the 1990s and September 11, 2001. Obama's desire to withdraw from costly and unpopular foreign conflicts and refocus on domestic issues is understandable. And he is by no means an isolationist, as his intensified war on al Qaeda can attest. But Obama's assertion that his recalibration of U.S. foreign policy -- centered on withdrawing U.S. troops from Mideast wars and leaning more on allies and the United Nations -- has awakened ""a new confidence in our leadership"" is without foundation. Like Great Britain in the 19th century, America since the turn of the 20th century has been the world's pivotal global power. Fair or not, in moments when America seemed unsure of its role in the world, the world noticed and reacted. There is no reason to believe now is different. Indeed, in many ways looming opportunists are more obvious today than the 1930s, 1970s and 1990s. These include al Qaeda and other Islamist movements spinning U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan as strategic defeats; an emboldened Iran on the cusp of attaining nuclear weapons; and a rising China flexing its muscles in the South China Sea. To his credit, Romney has strongly warned against a world with more limited American leadership. He has also promised to reverse Obama's defense cuts and offer his own increases. But while Obama's approach may be shortsighted, Romney's would face an uphill battle against fiscal and popular sentiment. These issues must certainly be raised in the upcoming presidential debates. Whoever wins in November will confront not just an increasingly dangerous world, but also an increasingly isolationist public. The great challenge will be to convince the American people that robust U.S. leadership in the world remains vital to their security and prosperity and convince the world it remains unwavering. History shows that doing otherwise only raises the stakes down the line. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stuart Gottlieb.","Stuart Gottlieb: Americans are sick of war and ready to focus on domestic issues .
Withdrawing troops, cutting military might be popular, but it is not without risks, he says .
Gottlieb: Historically, each time U.S. drew back militarily, global challengers took advantage .
He says Americans must believe in U.S. leadership; world must know U.S. is steadfast ."
"(CNN) -- Thomas Edison came up with a way to play back recorded sound in 1878. But 20 years before the inventor patented the phonograph, French scientist Ã‰douard-LÃ©on Scott de Martinville was fiddling around in his laboratory trying to come up with a way to record sound. His invention, the phonautogram, enabled him to create a visual representation of his voice. Scott de Martinville wasn't able to listen back to his recordings, though. The science of acoustics was in its infancy. He could only see lines etched in soot. His achievements were long-forgotten until a group of historians, audio engineers and scientists searched for his work. The First Sounds Collaborative found it in the archives of the French Academy of Sciences in 2008. ""His machine would capture the vibrations out of the air and write them on to a moving piece of paper,"" said David Giovannoni, one of the founders of First Sounds. ""When you look at the writing that this machine made, it looks exactly like a sound wave would look on audio editing software today."" Giovannoni and his group analyzed Scott de Martinville's work with audio software and unlocked the sound held in the waveforms. The result is like listening to a ghostly time machine, the voice of a man from 150 years ago singing French song ""Au Clair de la lune."" The earliest known sound recordings can be heard at www.firstsounds.org. Giovannoni said recordings like these are extremely important. ""Imagine studying art without being able to actually look at the canvases themselves. What modern technology and modern scholarship are opening up is a window into past human endeavors that we can hear through."" Nearly 20 years after Scott de Martinville experimented with recording his voice in Paris, Edison perfected a way to record and play back audio at his laboratory in New Jersey. His invention would spark a new industry, the recording business. Tim Brooks is a historian of early audio recordings. His home in Greenwich, Connecticut, is a private museum of sorts, with a collection of recording and playback devices from a century ago. Chests of drawers are filled with recordings made more than 100 years ago. Brooks is part of a network of historians and audiophiles on a mission to find and preserve the earliest recordings ever made. They do this with a sense of urgency. The recordings from the late 1800s were made on very fragile cylinders. ""They were made of a soft kind of wax,"" said Brooks. ""They're very subject to humidity and mold. And if they're not stored carefully, then you will take them out a few years later and suddenly you can't hear anything because the mold has eaten it up."" A new window onto history was recently opened up at Edison's laboratory in New Jersey. As the place was undergoing renovations, someone discovered a long-forgotten box containing cylinder recordings of Otto von Bismarck. The influential 19th-century statesman unified Germany and preserved peace in Europe for more than 40 years. The cylinders weren't in the best condition, but they were still listenable. Through the static, you can hear von Bismarck on the Thomas Edison National Historic Park's website reciting poetry. ""Nobody living today had ever heard the great German chancellor. Today we can,"" said Giovannoni. ""By hearing it, it conveys all sorts of information that may or may not have survived in printed accounts of the man and of his speaking."" Brooks is researching the earliest African-American recordings ever made as well as black spirituals recorded by white performers. He wrote extensively about Jack Johnson, the first African-American heavyweight boxing champion. In 1910, he beat a white man in what was called the fight of the century. His win sparked deadly race riots across a racially divided country. ""At that time, he recorded his description of the fight. ... This recording had been thought lost for years and years and years,"" said Brooks. ""He [Johnson] is usually portrayed as a kind of Muhammad Ali character, A very big living in your face guy in the middle of white America causing lots of turmoil because he lives so large and makes so many outrageous statements."" But the recording reveals a very different Jack Johnson. ""You can see that he's like a politician. He knows he's in a dangerous place because he's a black man in a very racist white American. And he's dealing with it in a way that is playing on the fairness of the game -- may the best man win -- as opposed to the racial aspects of it,"" said Brooks. ""That's a whole different view of this person than we did get before just from the written word."" Brooks says preserving long-forgotten recordings is important work precisely for that reason. ""In a way, scholarship hasn't caught up yet with the importance of recorded sound and understanding why leaders were able to lead and change history the way they did,"" said Brooks. ""Once in a while, if our ears are open and we're really listening it, can change our understanding of how they were able to do what they did."" Brooks anxiously awaits the next discovery of a long-forgotten recording that will change our view of history. In the meantime, he has plenty of wax recordings in his home museum to study and preserve.","Historians and audiophiles are on a mission to find and preserve the earliest recordings .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Artist Thomas Kinkade's death last month was from an accidental overdose of alcohol and Valium, according to the Santa Clara County, California, medical examiner. Kinkade, 54, also suffered from hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease, said the autopsy report released Monday. The report cited ""acute ethanol and diazepam intoxication"" as the cause of death and ""accidental"" as the manner of death. Diazepam is a prescription anti-anxiety drug also known as Valium. Related: Alcohol and Valium together can shut down the the brain . Kinkade, one of the most popular artists in America, painted more than 1,000 pieces on various topics, including cabins, nature scenes, seascapes and classic Americana. Art from the self-described ""painter of light,"" adorns many living rooms in America. It emphasizes simple pleasures and warm, positive images of idyllic cottages, lighthouses and colorful gardens. ""He had a rare ability to exude a sense of warmth, a transcendent light,"" said Robert Goodwin, who wrote the book ""Points of Light: A Celebration of the American Spirit of Giving,"" with Kinkade. ""He had a great commitment to inspire others -- one who was nurtured in his early life by family and friends and church to really be an example of selfless acts of service,"" he said Saturday. ""My mission as an artist is to capture those special moments in life adorned with beauty and light,"" Kinkade said in a message on his website. ""I work to create images that project a serene simplicity that can be appreciated and enjoyed by everyone. That's what I mean by sharing the light."" In 2006, the artist recalled one of his earliest lessons during an interview with CNN's Larry King. ""When I was a young boy, my mother told me, 'Your talents are God's gifts to you, and what you do with those talents are your gift to God,'"" he said.","Kinkade's autopsy found ""acute ethanol and diazepam intoxication""

"Swat Valley, Pakistan (CNN) -- The sister of a man suspected in the shooting of Pakistani teenager Malala Yousufzai has apologized to the victim. ""Please convey a message to Malala, that I apologize for what my brother did to her,"" Rehana Haleem told CNN on Sunday in an exclusive interview here about her brother, Attah Ullah Khan, 23. ""He has brought shame on our family. We have lost everything after what he did."" Police have said they were searching for Khan and two boys, whom authorities have not identified. Since age 11, Malala had been encouraging her fellow Pakistanis to stand up to the Taliban, who were trying to push girls from classrooms. Pakistan's Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . On October 9, Malala -- who is now 15 -- was on her school van in the Taliban-held Swat Valley when thugs stopped the vehicle and jumped on board. They demanded that other girls riding identify Malala. They shot two girls, who suffered non-life-threatening injuries, and fired at Malala, striking her in the head and neck, according to officials. ""What he did was intolerable,"" Haleem said. ""Malala is just like my sister. I'd like to express my concern for Malala on behalf of my whole family; I hope she recovers soon and returns to a happy and normal life as soon as possible. I hope Malala doesn't consider me or my family as enemies. I don't consider Atta Ullah my brother anymore."" A day after the attack, security forces searched the family's house, seizing documents and pictures, and taking Haleem and her family to a nearby house equipped with bars on the doors and windows, she said. The officers asked where Atta Ullah was and whether his sister knew how to reach him by cell phone, but she said she told them she did not. Read more: Malala is face of global attacks on schools . ""I was pregnant and sick,"" she said. ""Then, finally, after a day or two, they released me and my husband and told me they were letting me go only because I was sick."" Haleem spoke to CNN from her home in Warhi Mast Malik Abad, a village on the outskirts of the city of Mingora, where the attack tookplace. After the couple were released, they returned to the house, where she gave birth to a daughter, she said. Five days later, the army again raided the house, this time taking away only her husband. Haleem said her husband, her aged mother, her uncle and another brother remain in custody. Haleem said she had little doubt that her brother was involved in the shooting.

In January of that year, the Taliban issued an edict ordering that no school should educate girls. After the shooting, the Taliban issued a statement online saying that, if Malala were to survive, they would attack her again. If Malala returns to Pakistan, guards will protect her and her family, Pakistan's interior minister, Rehman Malik, has said.","""He has brought shame on our family,"" says suspect's sister .

"(CNN) -- It is the much-anticipated book many in football have been waiting for, while others have feared its publication. Alex Ferguson's autobiography offered the tantalizing prospect of lifting the lid on life as the manager of one of the world's biggest football clubs -- Manchester United. Ferguson retired after 27 years at Old Trafford in May, giving him time to reflect on a career which has seen the Scotsman clash with the great and the good of world football. If you don't have the time to sift through Ferguson's 400-page memoir, don't worry. CNN is here to help, with the 10 things you can't afford to miss from ""Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography."" Ferguson on Wayne Rooney: . Ferguson and the United staff were impressed with Rooney from a young age. ""This was a man playing in under-age football,"" the Scot's scouting reports told him when he was a schoolboy playing for rival club Everton. United attempted to sign Rooney at the ages of 14 and 16, but on both occasions the young striker turned the Old Trafford club down, with the forward's commitment to Everton being such that the club was ""in his blood,"" according to Ferguson. ""A remarkable raw talent,"" is how Ferguson describes the player he finally signed in 2004, but he also labels Rooney as ""not the quickest learner."" Ferguson also didn't take kindly to Rooney's suggestions as to which players United might sign. Playmaker Mesut Ozil is currently delighting Arsenal fans with his sparkling form. And according to Ferguson, the German was a player Rooney thought United should have bought in 2010, before he joined Real Madrid from Werder Bremen. Ferguson told Rooney in no uncertain terms that it was ""none of his business who we should have gone for."" Ferguson on Roy Keane: . Roy Keane played for United between 1993 and 2005, acting as Ferguson's general and captain out on the pitch. ""He was the most influential presence in the dressing room in the time we worked together,"" says Ferguson. ""Roy took a lot of the onus off me in making sure the dressing room was operating at a high level of motivation."" But Keane was fiercely critical of players who he deemed weren't committed to the United cause and as his relationship with the club fractured, it would be his undoing. The Irishman lambasted some of the team's younger players during an interview with United's MUTV television channel. ""The hardest part of his body is his tongue,"" says Ferguson of Keane. ""He had the most savage tongue you can imagine."" Keane left United to sign for boyhood club Celtic, where he played 10 games before retiring in June 2006. Ferguson on David Beckham: . Both Ferguson and David Beckham bowed out of football at the end of the 2012-13 season, with the former saying ""He went out at Paris Saint-Germain much as I did at United: on his own terms."" Beckham left United to join Real Madrid in 2003 and Ferguson details how the relationship between the two had deteriorated. After a 2-0 defeat to Arsenal in February 2003, Ferguson kicked a boot which flew towards Beckham and struck him just about his left eye. It marked the beginning of the end of Beckham's United career. Ferguson suggests Beckham became distracted by the media storm which follows him wherever he goes. ""His eye was off the ball,"" says Ferguson. ""A shame, because he could still have been at Manchester United when I left."" Ferguson does praise the former England captain's tenacity and longevity, but wonders whether Beckham might live to regret swapping European football for Major League Soccer and the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. ""At some point in his life, he may feel the urge to say: I made a mistake."" Ferguson on Suarez/Evra affair: . One of the great controversies of Ferguson's latter years at United is the racism row which erupted between Patrice Evra and Luis Suarez, of the club's great rivals Liverpool. Suarez was hit with an eight-game ban in December 2011 for racially abusing Evra, with Ferguson highly critical of how then Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish handled the affair. Suarez refused to shake Evra's hand ahead of a match later on in the 2011-12 season, an act which drew Ferguson's ire. ""A club of Liverpool's stature should have done something about that, but he played in the game all the same,"" recalls Ferguson. ""I called Suarez a 'disgrace to Liverpool' and said they would be wise to 'get rid' of him."" Blog: Can brain power improve footballers? Ferguson on England job: . The passionate Scotsman reveals he was twice offered the chance to manage the England national team, in 1999 and 2001. But it was not a job he entertained accepting for one minute. ""There was no way I could contemplate taking the England job,"" he says. ""Can you imagine me doing that? A Scotsman? ""I always joked that I would take the position and relegate them: make them the 150th rated country in the world, with Scotland 149."" Ferguson on Cristiano Ronaldo: . He is in no doubt that Ronaldo was ""the most gifted player I managed."" ""He surpassed all the other great ones (players) I coached at United. And I had many,"" says Ferguson of the Portuguese star. Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a then world record fee of Â£80 million pounds in 2009, a transfer which Ferguson describes as ""a clever move by them."" ""It was a way for Florentino Perez, their president, to say to the world 'We are Real Madrid, we are the biggest of the lot.'"" It marked the end of a two-year pursuit of Ronaldo by Real Madrid. Perez's predecessor as Real president Ramon Calderon made a bid to sign the explosive forward in 2008 which irked Ferguson, with the Scot telling Ronaldo ""I'd rather shoot you than sell you to that guy now."" A year later, Ronaldo was unveiled in the Spanish capital. Ferguson on Barcelona: . In 2009 and 2011, Ferguson saw his United team lose to Barcelona in European Champions League finals. Barcelona's style of play was unrivaled in Ferguson's eyes and he describes the Catalan team as ""the best team ever to line up against my Manchester United sides."" Ferguson reserves special praise for Lionel Messi, the four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner who was to become Barcelona's talisman. ""The group of world-beaters who formed around Messi were formidable,"" declares Ferguson. ""I felt no envy towards those great sides. Regrets yes, when we lost to them, but jealousy, no."" Ferguson on Sven Goran Eriksson: . Ferguson first announced his intention to retire in 2001, saying he would sever all ties with United in May 2002. Eventually he performed a U-turn and signed a new contract with the club and the rest, as they say, is history. But for a large part of the 2001-02 season, United's board were trying to identify a successor to Ferguson. The man they had in mind, according to Ferguson, was then England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson. ""The head-hunters were due to meet a candidate to succeed me the following week,"" explains Ferguson. ""Sven-Goran Eriksson was to be the new Manchester United manager, I believe ... I remember asking Paul Scholes one day: ""Scholesy, what's Eriksson got?' but Scholesy could shed no light."" Ferguson on Jose Mourinho: . When Jose Mourinho was unveiled as Chelsea manager in 2004, Ferguson suspected he could be a serious rival to United in the pursuit of major honors. ""Jose was fresh in town, working for an employer with stacks of money, and with hype clearing his path,"" Ferguson says of the manager who arrived at Chelsea after guiding an unfancied Porto team to European Champions League glory in 2004. ""(Chelsea) were much better organized than before. I didn't win a game at Stamford Bridge after Mourinho arrived."" Mourinho rejoined Chelsea earlier this year, after winning an Italian league, cup and Champions League treble with Inter Milan in 2010 and a Spanish title with Real Madrid in 2012. Ferguson on rivals Manchester City: . In a thrilling climax to the 2011-12 English Premier League season, Ferguson saw his United team lose out on the title to their neighbors Manchester City, who scored a last-minute goal on the final day of the campaign to secure their triumph. Ferguson felt the pain of a crushing defeat, but it was his wife Cathy who was inconsolable. ""Cathy said, 'That was the worst day of my life. I can't take much more of this.' ""I felt pretty ragged myself, but I could see the distress in my wife. 'Cathy,' I began, 'we have a great life, and we've had a fantastic period of success.' 'I know,' she said. 'but I'm not going out. There are too many City fans in the village.'"" Cathy need not have worried. United beat City to the title by 11 points in 2013, with Ferguson retiring after securing the club's 20th English championship.","Alex Ferguson's autobiography unveiled .

"(CNN) -- These quirky museums, theme parks and circus acts feed our collective cat obsession. Stephanie Harwin, who writes the cat-obsessed blog Catsparella, will go to great lengths to get her feline fix. On her quest to fulfill a lifelong dream, visiting Japan's Hello Kitty theme park, Harwin endured a bout of severe food poisoning, a language barrier and a long journey to reach her happy place. Japan is the ultimate travel destination for cat enthusiasts and Hello Kitty is just the beginning. Tokyo has become famous for its cat cafés, where you can hang out with the furry creatures, and each February brings the celebration of ""Nyan Nyan Nyan Day"" (a name inspired by the sound cats make). Meet Grumpy Cat . While the Japanese have the highest per capita cat ownership in the world, there are people crazy for cats everywhere. London's Zoological Society even created a global cat map that allows you to plot the location of your own pet and upload its photo. All this cat love has resulted in some strangely charming places where travelers can stop to pay tribute. These vacation ideas are the cat's meow. Cat Cafés, Tokyo . Japan's obsession with all things feline is well documented. After all, this is the homeland of YouTube star Maru, a Scottish fold whose antics have amassed more than 200 million views. Tokyo itself counts more than a hundred ""neko"" or cat cafés, where patrons come to sip lattes and socialize with numerous cats, who lounge around on chairs, sofas, baskets and occasionally the laps of their human fans. Some of the more popular: Shimokitazawa's Cateriam, Nekobukuro in Ikebukuro, Curl Up Café in Haramachi, and Nyafe Melange. There's even a handy map to locate them. Festival of the Cats, Ypres, Belgium . The Kattenstoet (Festival of the Cats) is held every three years on the second Sunday of May; the next is scheduled for 2015. It celebrates the noble feline with a street parade of floats, music, stilt walkers and costumed townsfolk, many of whom dress as cats, witches or mice. The festival culminates with a performance in which a jester tosses children's toy cats from the Cloth Hall belfry down to the crowd—a tradition that harks back to the harsh Middle Ages practice of throwing actual cats from the belfry in the spring. (Not to worry: no kitties are harmed in the modern reenactments.) Travel + Leisure: Coolest vacations for dog lovers . Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum, Key West, Florida . Cat fanatics who are also Hemingway fans will find nirvana at the writer's former Key West home. The grand, plantation-style limestone house is the domain of around 50 cats descended from Papa's original Maine coon, Snowball, who was given to him by a ship's captain. The cats are polydactyl (six-toed), which lends them their distinctive appearance—some say it looks like the cats are wearing mittens. Hemingway named many of his cats after famous people, and the estate carries on the tradition today; look for Lionel Barrymore and Hairy Truman. Moscow Cats Theatre . This second-generation Russian theater, founded by Yuri Kuklachev and his son Dmitri in 1990, performs in Moscow when the troupe—which includes around 120 cats—isn't touring the world. Shows feature a revolving series of madcap acts with names like Catnappers, Cat Clowns and Love, and Cats from the Universe. Expect to see the Kuklachevs' furry stars performing stunts: walking a tightrope, teetering on a rocking horse and posing on top of a mirror ball. Kuching Cat Museum, Malaysia . Cats are considered lucky in Malaysia, as in many Asian cultures, and the Kuching Cat Museum in Sarawak pays respectful, if slightly wacky, homage to these fortune-bestowing felines. For starters, you enter the UFO-style building through a giant cat face. Inside await exhibitions, artifacts, artworks and ephemera dedicated to cats. The pièce de résistance: a 1,000-year-old mummified Egyptian kitty. The museum is on a hill, with great views of the city of Kuching, which translates as ""cat city."" Travel + Leisure: Outrageous hotel perks for pets . The Supreme Cat Show, Birmingham, UK . At the UK's largest and most prestigious cat show, held each November at the National Exhibition Centre near Birmingham, you can watch cats relax in their pens and be judged in the ring, and browse for every cat product imaginable at an array of stands. Each cat gets a large double pen, decorated by its owner with brightly colored drapes or more creative trappings based on a given theme. In 2012, it was ""Diamonds are forever."" Torre Argentina Cat Sanctuary, Rome . The mission of this sanctuary is to ""work together to raise the quality of life of Rome's abandoned cats""—and it welcomes volunteers. Expect to perform duties such as cleaning cages and distributing food to some of the 300-odd cat residents; if you're living in Rome you can volunteer as a ""foster parent"" for young kittens in your own home. The site, which contains ancient ruins, has a glamorous pedigree: while filming at the nearby Teatro Argentina, Italian actress Anna Magnani famously spent her breaks here feeding the cats. Dominique and His Flying House Cats, Key West, Florida . Dominique LeFort is one of the more idiosyncratic locals—and in Margaritaville, that's really saying something. The performer and his troupe of trained house cats entertain regularly at Sunset Celebration, a nightly arts festival at Mallory Square Dock. The shaggy-haired Frenchman ushers his nonchalant cats across tightropes and through flaming hoops, all while keeping up a madcap banter with the audience (including his catchphrase, ""Clap, clap, clap!""), a shtick that has earned the act a cult following. Travel + Leisure: World's Strangest statues . Poezenboot, Amsterdam, the Netherlands . Cats and water don't usually mix well, yet this floating cat sanctuary on Amsterdam's Herengracht canal has proven a grand success. Founded in 1966 by a local legend named Henriette van Weelde—who took in stray cats and eventually moved them onto a houseboat in the canal—the floating barge has become a tourist attraction, drawing cat lovers and the curious alike. Visitors can volunteer, donate or adopt. Hello Kitty theme park, Tokyo . A pilgrimage to Tokyo's Hello Kitty theme park, known officially as Sanrio Puroland, is a must for fans of the cult cat character (a Japanese white bobtail). The park attracts 1.5 million annual visitors of all ages, who come from far and wide to watch Hello Kitty-themed musicals, take a spin on cat-tastic rides and visit Hello Kitty's house, which features portraits of the famous cat's family and a bathtub shaped like her face. There's also a boat ride in which another Sanrio character, Cinnamoroll, leads visitors on a trip to Hello Kitty's party. See More Places for Cat Lovers at Travel + Leisure. Planning a getaway?

"(CNN) -- It was like any blind date. I had dressed in my Saturday best and walked to my favorite brunch restaurant in West Los Angeles to meet a guy -- let's call him Raj -- for the first time. I recognized him from the pictures I'd seen, and we greeted each other with smiles and a firm handshake. We had e-mailed a few times and spoken on the phone to confirm our plans. He was polite; he didn't sit down in his chair until I did, and he paid the bill. Our conversation was casual to begin with: favorite movies, music, plans for the summer. No one would have guessed this setup was to be the start of an arranged marriage. Most Westerners may think the concept of arranged marriage is backward or antiquated -- and if you watch the old Indian movies, it can come across that way: two people meet once, or not at all, before their wedding day and then are forced to make a marriage work without even being consulted about their partner. In my family, at least, that was rarely the case. My parents met and spoke before their wedding day in India and were asked whether they each saw a future with the other. It's easy for me to rebel against this tradition my family has maintained and say, ""That was then, this is now."" But despite having been born and raised in America, where arrangements like this are far from a cultural norm, I understand their perspective. All they want for me is security. Raj had a stable job, and he's well-educated. He is from a well-reputed family and comes highly recommended by family friends as a hard-working, respectful man. He was a catch in my parents' eyes. I decided to meet him after nearly a year of my parents pestering me to meet potential mates that I waved off for various reasons -- I was too young, I needed time to start my career off right, I wasn't interested, etc. But finally I caved. By the time Raj and I had finished our brunch that sunny Saturday, I knew that a relationship would never work out. We had nothing in common except for our heritage, yet I didn't end the date there. I felt a responsibility to at least give him a little bit more time. I attributed the awkwardness of our interactions to nervousness. Maybe I was being hypercritical? Did I peg him as a boring because he ordered the fruit plate for brunch when all I wanted was a large omelet? A part of me wanted something to work out between us; maybe we could date for a little while and then get married and make everyone happy. But as we talked after brunch that day, it was more apparent that a romance between Raj and me wasn't in the cards. His ideals were far more traditional than mine. I felt like I needed to be another person around him, not the career-oriented, passionate, food-loving, world-traveling woman that I am. I was also headed to graduate school in the fall and had to consider being engaged and trying to start a relationship with someone during that hectic time. At the end of our date, he asked whether we could get married that December. Get married? I wasn't even sure I wanted to have dessert with him! So I awkwardly tried to skirt around the subject of marriage and explained that I had a lot to think about with grad school coming up. I was hoping he'd mistake my dishonesty for kindness. After I went back to Singapore, where I lived at the time, I discussed the decision with my parents and outlined the reasons why I knew things would never work between Raj and me, even though we hadn't spent much time together. To my surprise, they understood and trusted my judgment. I then had the tough task of telling Raj we wouldn't be marrying in December. He responded with a polite e-mail telling me he understood my decision. I never talked to him again. Since then, my parents have let the subject of an arranged marriage drop. I gave their way a chance and that was enough for them. I think they understand I'm different from my cousins -- and mostly because they raised me to be the person I am today. But I do understand their reasons behind trying to get me to consider an arranged marriage. It's not some foreign tradition they arbitrarily adopted to make me miserable or different. They want me to find someone they approve of and I can learn to love. They want me to be settled, and most importantly they want me to be happy. Maybe if Raj had been my ideal guy, I would have been married by now. I wish I could have come back to my parents and told them that all they wanted for me and all I wanted in a husband had aligned in Raj. I don't know if I'll end up having an arranged marriage -- likely not. But that's not because I had a horrifying experience. What I do know is that until I get married, my mom will be dropping not-so-subtle hints that the best (Mother's Day, birthday, holiday ...) gift for her would be me getting married. And in case you were wondering, Raj got married that December, just like he wanted.","The author's parents wanted to arrange her marriage, but she avoided the subject .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures. But only about 1 percent of federal background checks are rejected. Nearly 60 percent of those failing background checks, or nearly 578,000 people, were rejected because of a felony or serious misdemeanor conviction, according to information on the FBI website that was updated this month. Federally-licensed gun sellers are not allowed to sell a firearm without a completed review by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Universal background check: What does it mean? Statistics show about 1 percent of applicants who failed a background check, or 10,180 people, were turned down for reasons related to mental health. Involuntary commitment to a psychiatric institution or an inability to manage personal affairs are reasons why someone would be rejected for mental health reasons. Vice President Joe Biden has led a task force that is recommending proposals to President Barack Obama this week to stem gun violence. One focus of the current debate is whether more can be done in the mental health area. FBI statistics show that 143,852 would-be gun buyers were turned down for domestic violence convictions or because they were subjected to a restraining order related to domestic violence issues, like stalking or making threats. More than 94,000 fugitives with warrants for their arrest were not allowed to buy guns. People with a history of drug addiction accounted for almost 81,000 denials. Almost 12,000 illegal immigrants also did not pass background checks to buy firearms.","More than one million people seeking to buy guns turned down over past 14 years .

"(CNN) -- Able to scare up a few bucks? Just in time for Halloween, the owners of the home made famous in the spooky 1970s film ""The Amityville Horror"" are dramatically slashing the asking price on their Toms River, New Jersey, colonial, which was used for exteriors in the film. The decision wasn't triggered by demonic activity, however. Apparently, another frightening ""D"" word was to blame. ""My husband and I are getting a divorce,"" said Odalys Fragoso, who bought the house with her husband Jose Fragoso in 2001. ""It's not that the house is haunted or anything. We had wonderful times in that house."" The couple purchased the house for $795,000. Originally listed last year at $1.45 million, the four-bedroom, three-bath home is now going for $955,000 -- a bargain, according to the agent. ""If there were a curse on it, I wouldn't be in it,"" joked Donna Walesiewicz, the broker selling the 3,370-square-foot residence. ""It is what it is, a nice old stately home."" It was also the perfect place for Hollywood producers, who used it as a double for the real Amityville house when shooting the 1979 movie. The film, based on Jay Anson's 1977 best-seller, featured buzzing flies, ghostly eyes, blood pouring from the walls and a satanic voice warning a visiting priest to ""Get out!"" The film starred James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger. The story has its origins in the real-life tale of the Lutz family, who purchased a house in Long Island, New York, in December 1975. The Lutzes' reports of strange and horrific experiences became the heart of the book and film. The ""Amityville"" franchise has since churned out an ample supply of sequels over the past 30 years, from a 3D version to a 2005 vehicle for Ryan Reynolds. Fragoso's waterfront homestead, built in 1920, is nowhere near the Lutzes' old haunt -- about 100 miles and a state line away -- and is anything but scary. Spread out over half an acre, it boasts a furnished basement, a lounge in the attic, hardwood floors and a two-car garage. There's also a pool and a dock. ""The property alone, being on that river, you have that southern exposure, it's just a beautiful home,"" said Walesiewicz. How can the price be reduced a half-million dollars in only a year? Nothing suspicious about it: Walesiewicz said it's a sign of the times. ""The housing market has dropped tremendously,"" she said. ""That's why people are coming down and buying homes in cash. They aren't making money in other investments. They are putting it in real estate."" This isn't the first time the price has been reduced. Last year it dropped from $1.45 million to $1.35 million before the house was taken off the market in October. Fragoso rehung the ""for sale"" sign again in May, this time for $1.25 million. Even then, the house drew little interest. Odalys Fragoso, 51, who is in the middle of divorce proceedings after 33 years of marriage, said the house was appraised this summer for $1.1 million, but the judge told her and her husband they had to lower the price. Which is why it's now at $955,000, she said. Dozens of fans of the movie have appeared at her doorstep over the years, taking pictures and asking questions. ""They were thrilled that they filmed the movie there,"" Fragoso said. She also never sensed the house held any sinister secrets or apparitions. ""I never felt anything, nothing whatsoever. I was just happy that we were buying the house because we saw the potential of it,"" Fragoso said. ""It's not haunted, not at all.""","House used for exteriors of ""Amityville Horror"" movie is for sale .

"(CNN) -- We're in the midst of a bionic revolution, yet most of us don't know it. Around 220,000 people worldwide already walk around with cochlear implants -- devices worn around the ear that turn sound waves into electrical impulses shunted directly into the auditory nerve. Tens of thousands of people have been implanted with deep brain stimulators, devices that send an electrode tunneling several inches in the brain. Deep brain stimulators are used to control Parkinson's disease, though lately they've also been tested -- with encouraging results -- in use against severe depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. The most obvious bionics are those that replace limbs. Olympian ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius, now awaiting trial for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, made a splash with his Cheetah carbon fiber prostheses. Yet those are a relatively simple technology -- a curved piece of slightly springy, super-strong material. In the digital age, we're seeing more sophisticated limbs. Explore the bionic body . Consider the thought-controlled bionic leg that Zac Vawter used to climb all 103 floors of Chicago's Willis Tower. Or the nerve-controlled bionic hand that Iraq war veteran Glen Lehman had attached after the loss of his original hand. Or the even more sophisticated i-limb Ultra, an artificial hand with five independently articulating artificial fingers. Those limbs don't just react mechanically to pressure. They actually respond to the thoughts and intentions of their owners, flexing, extending, gripping, and releasing on mental command. The age when prostheses were largely inert pieces of wood, metal, and plastic is passing. Advances in microprocessors, in techniques to interface digital technology with the human nervous system, and in battery technology to allow prostheses to pack more power with less weight are turning replacement limbs into active parts of the human body. In some cases, they're not even part of the body at all. Consider the case of Cathy Hutchinson. In 1997, Cathy had a stroke, leaving her without control of her arms. Hutchinson volunteered for an experimental procedure that could one day help millions of people with partial or complete paralysis. She let researchers implant a small device in the part of her brain responsible for motor control. With that device, she is able to control an external robotic arm by thinking about it. That, in turn, brings up an interesting question: If the arm isn't physically attached to her body, how far away could she be and still control it? The answer is at least thousands of miles. In animal studies, scientists have shown that a monkey with a brain implant can control a robot arm 7,000 miles away. The monkey's mental signals were sent over the internet, from Duke University in North Carolina, to the robot arm in Japan. In this day and age, distance is almost irrelevant. The superhuman frontier . The 7,000-mile-away prosthetic arm makes an important point: These new prostheses aren't just going to restore missing human abilities. They're going to enhance our abilities, giving us powers we never had before, and augmenting other capabilities we have. While the current generation of prostheses is still primitive, we can already see this taking shape when a monkey moves a robotic arm on the other side of the planet just by thinking about it. Other research is pointing to enhancements to memory and decision making. The hippocampus is a small, seahorse-shaped part of the brain that's essential in forming new memories. If it's damaged -- by an injury to the head, for example -- people start having difficulty forming new long-term memories. In the most extreme cases, this can lead to the complete inability to form new long-term memories, as in the film Memento. Working to find a way to repair this sort of brain damage, researchers in 2011 created a ""hippocampus chip"" that can replace damaged brain tissue. When they implanted it in rats with a damaged hippocampus, they found that not only could their chip repair damaged memory -- it could improve the rats' ability to learn new things. Nor is memory the end of it. Another study, in 2012, demonstrated that we can boost intelligence -- at least one sort -- in monkeys. Scientists at Wake Forest University implanted specialized brain chips in a set of monkeys and trained those monkeys to perform a picture-matching game. When the implant was activated, it raised their scores by an average of 10 points on a 100-point scale. The implant makes monkeys smarter. From disabled to super-capable . Both of those technologies for boosting memory and intelligence are in very early stages, in small animal studies only, and years (or possibly decades) away from wide use in humans. Still, they make us wonder -- what happens when it's possible to improve on the human body and mind? Read this: Snake arms and crystal legs: Amazing artificial limbs . The debate has started already, of course. Oscar Pistorius had to fight hard for inclusion in the Olympics. Many objected that his carbon fiber prostheses gave him a competitive advantage. He was able -- with the help of doctors and biomedical engineers -- to make a compelling case that his Cheetah blades didn't give him any advantage on the field. But how long will that be true? How long until we have prostheses (not to mention drugs and genetic therapies) that make athletes better in their sports? But the issue is much, much wider than professional sports. We may care passionately about the integrity of the Olympics or professional cycling or so on, but they only directly affect a very small number of us. In other areas of life -- in the workforce in particular -- enhancement technology might affect all of us. When it's possible to make humans smarter, sharper, and faster, how will that affect us? Will the effect be mostly positive, boosting our productivity and the rate of human innovation? Or will it be just another pressure to compete at work? Who will be able to afford these technologies? Will anyone be able to have their body, and more importantly, their brain upgraded? Or will only the rich have access to these enhancements? We have a little while to consider these questions, but we ought to start. The technology will sneak its way into our lives, starting with people with disabilities, the injured, and the ill. It'll improve their lives in ways that are unquestionably good. And then, one day, we'll wake up and realize that we're doing more than restoring lost function. We're enhancing it. Superhuman technology is on the horizon. Time to start thinking about what that means for us.

"(CNN) -- Saint Augustine is thought to have claimed that patience is the companion of wisdom. Increase your store of both virtues by following this advice from a truck driver, a world traveler and others who know a thing or two about serenity-threatening situations. Stop imagining the ideal . I often grow impatient when I want to be in control of a situation. To avoid getting antsy when I am writing and can't find specific words for my thoughts, I try to practice self-compassion. I tell myself that I'm not going to quit even if I become frustrated. I'll say out loud, ""You're not perfect, but that's OK. Writing can be a messy process, and it's not ideal, but you can handle it."" Real Simple: How to make positive changes in your life . Talking to yourself may feel awkward and goofy, but it quells that feeling of impatience. And it certainly beats foraging for carbs, which I'm also apt to do when I'm agitated and have writer's block. -- BrenÃ© Brown . Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work and the author of the best-selling book ""Daring Greatly."" She has given one of the top 10 most-viewed talks on TED.com. Experience different cultures . When you travel the world, you find out that many cultures aren't as punctual and perfectionistic as ours, and encountering those perspectives can mellow you. To work on your patience closer to home, try visiting an area populated by people of a different culture (such as a city's Chinatown) or take part in a festival held by an immigrant community. Real Simple: What to say in awkward social situations . I recently visited a Vietnamese farmers' market in New Orleans. I was annoyed that it was open only between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. and I wanted to know why. The answer? I learned that often in cultures dependent on fishing, much of the work is done before daybreak. It was good to remind myself that simply because people do something differently doesn't mean that they're wrong. -- Seth Kugel . Kugel writes the Frugal Traveler column for The New York Times. He lives in New York City and SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.. Find a distraction . Being out on the road for weeks on end can certainly test your patience. My wife and I -- we drive as a team -- have to deal with other drivers and the annoyances of traffic jams, and it's natural to be anxious in these moments. We overcome that feeling by giving each other something else to think about. Real Simple: 5 mistakes everyone should make . For example, my wife tells jokes and catches me up on the latest Facebook posts from friends. Or I'll talk to my dogs (they also travel with us), since they provide emotional support without offering any opinions. Those quick moments of distraction recharge me, and I can again focus on the road without being irritated. -- Wade Briggs . Briggs, based in Boise, Idaho, is a commercial truck driver for Mayflower, a nationwide full-service moving company. He has been driving a truck for 18 years. Chew your food slowly . People who consume food more slowly -- and ignore those ""I'm hungry"" urges -- eat less overall than those who devour their meals. Research has found that impatient people are more likely to be overweight, possibly because of their inability to delay gratification at the dinner table. Real Simple: 5 great things about growing old . This practice can help you in other areas of life as well: By eating slowly, you can train yourself to be less impulsive and more patient in general. -- Charles Courtemanche . Courtemanche is an assistant professor of economics at Georgia State University in Atlanta. He has studied the relationship between obesity and patience. Laugh at yourself . I'm a newspaper columnist and my husband is a politician, so both of us must be willing to converse with strangers when we're eating out or shopping for groceries. In the rare moments when people are obnoxious (like the time a woman told me that I needed to get Botox), I can get impatient. But instead of being rude to the person, I formulate an internal joke, usually at my own expense. Real Simple: 5 ways to win people over .

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN)  -- American children aren't necessarily getting smarter or dumber, but that might not be good enough to compete globally, according to numbers cited Tuesday by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. The National Center for Education Statistics found U.S. students placed below average in math and science. He noted a special analysis put out last week by the National Center for Education Statistics that compares 15-year-old U.S. students with students from other countries in the Organization for Economic Development. It found the U.S. students placed below average in math and science. In math, U.S. high schoolers were in the bottom quarter of the countries that participated, trailing countries including Finland, China and Estonia. According to the report, the U.S. math scores were not measurably different in 2006 from the previous scores in 2003. But while other countries have improved, the United States has remained stagnant. In science, the United States falls behind countries such as Canada, Japan and the Czech Republic. Duncan told a room full of science and math experts of the National Science Board on Tuesday morning that this will hurt the United States as it competes internationally. ""We are lagging the rest of the world, and we are lagging it in pretty substantial ways,"" he said. ""I think we have become complacent. We've sort of lost our way."" He acknowledged that in some areas of the United States it is hard to find good math and science teachers. To solve that problem, he said, ""I think we should pay math and science teachers a lot more money. We pay everybody the same. We have areas of critical need -- math, science, foreign language, special education in some places. I think we need to pay a premium for that."" The National Education Association, which represents teachers, argues against such a proposal. ""Simply being a teacher of a hard-to-staff subject does not equate with effective instruction, and therefore, should not be rewarded in-and-of-itself through a salary differential,"" the organization says in a position statement. The fourth- and eighth-graders who were part of the mathematics testing have improved their average scores compared with their European counterparts, but they still lag behind their Asian peers in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Singapore. In science, fourth-graders have fallen behind other students even though their average scores remained about the same. The eighth-graders' scores remain about the same compared to 1995. ""It has huge implications,"" Duncan said. ""I think as a real economic imperative we have to educate our way to a better economy.""","National Center for Education Statistics put out special analysis .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Convenient as they are for a quick bite, hotel restaurants can get a bad rap for uninspired menus and bland atmosphere — sometimes, deservedly so. But there's been a countervailing trend gathering strength since the mid-'90s, and some of the hottest restaurants are now opening in hotels, proving to be destinations for locals and tourists alike. As Spanish chef José Andrés says, with ""so many great dining and drinking experiences in hotels, it is bringing back a golden age when hotels were the only places to meet out for a dinner."" Travel + Leisure: See more of America's hottest hotel restaurants . Savvy hoteliers like Ian Schrager, Andre Balazs, and Steve Wynn were among the pioneers, seeing the possibility of luring guests with high-concept design and high-caliber culinary talent. ""Vegas had a lot to do with it,"" says Charlie Palmer, who has seven hotel restaurants. ""They wanted the branding, not just someone to cook. They realized a lot of people travel by their stomachs, and a great restaurant from a well-known chef not only offers a great dining experience, it brings notoriety to a hotel."" 10 of America's best historic restaurants . For chef Daniel Humm, of the three-Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park, opening a new restaurant at the NoMad Hotel in New York stoked his creativity. ""We had the opportunity to think about the kinds of things people want to eat while they're reading in the hotel library or soaking in a luxurious bathtub, things we had never done before,"" he says. Travel + Leisure: World's top revolving restaurants . Creating a distinctive identity can be crucial to a hotel restaurant's success. At New York's Locanda Verde, chef and restaurateur Andrew Carmellini insisted on a separate street entrance (""No one wants to walk through a lobby to get to a restaurant,"" he says) and contrasting music and décor. He says that, as a result, ""the place feels authentic, like it has soul."" Carmellini followed up Locanda Verde with another buzzed-about hotel restaurant: The Dutch at the W South Beach Hotel & Residences. Let's face it: no one, even a jet-lagged, hungry traveler, wants to eat at a restaurant jam-packed with tourists. Travelers today seek experiences rooted in a place — and that's the goal of many of these new hotel restaurants, including a newcomer at Atlanta's InterContinental Hotel Buckhead that takes southern comfort foods to a new level. ""I really believe this is the future of our industry,"" says Wolfgang Puck, who certainly helped fuel the trend; his latest in the revamped Hotel Bel-Air brings his hotel restaurant count to 16.

"(CNN) -- The human rights activist who entered the 55th day of a hunger strike in Bahrain on Tuesday may not survive the ordeal, his daughter told CNN. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja ""is entering a critical phase, where his life is at stake,"" his daughter, Maryam al-Khawaja said. She said two doctors accompanied her father at all times Monday night, and he was being moved Tuesday to a different prison that has medical equipment he needs. The move is because of fears that he may go into a coma at any time, as his blood sugar and blood pressure have further dropped, she said. On Tuesday, the attending physician at the Correction and Rehabilitation Center recommended that he be transferred to the Public Security Fort for constant medical observation and care, a spokeswoman for the government's Information Affairs Authority said. The Interior Ministry's general inspector said Tuesday that ""all policies and procedures of the prison facilities in Bahrain meet international human rights standards and all detainees have consistent and reliable access to professional medical care,"" according to a statement from Maj. Gen. Tariq H. Al Hasan, a spokesman for the ministry. Al Khawaja's medical condition ""is under constant surveillance"" and he is provided with daily medical care, al-Hasan said in the statement. On 30 March, he was found to have low blood pressure and was taken to Bahrain Defense Force Hospital, where he was treated and returned to Jau Prison the following day, it said. Records showed that Al Khawaja had lost about 10 kilograms (22 pounds) and had a low hemoglobin level, though not critically low. It said he was taking fluids, mineral supplements, glucose and juice on a daily basis. The activist, who was arrested last April for his role in anti-government demonstrations that swept through his country in February and March, has been on a hunger strike for eight weeks to protest his life prison term. In June, al-Khawaja and seven other Shiite opposition activists were found guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's Sunni royal family. They were sentenced to life in prison. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights, a nonprofit human rights group started by al-Khawaja and for which his daughter works, has appealed for his immediate release on humanitarian grounds. His life is in danger, Maryam al-Khawaja said, ""and getting to a situation where there might be an unrepairable damage to his physical well-being, if he survives."" Maryam al-Khawaja said he and 13 other detained leaders had their cases taken Monday to the Court of Cassation, where lawyers requested that they be released pending a court decision. The judge refused the request and announced that the decision will be read on April 23, she said. ""We urge the government to take into consideration the deteriorating health condition of Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja that cannot wait until the court's decision,"" she said. ""Any damage to the health of Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja is the responsibility of the Bahraini government."" UK Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt met with officials in Bahrain on Tuesday to discuss progress on reform and human rights issues, the Foreign Office said in a statement. ""We hope that the steps taken so far by the Bahraini government will provide the basis for further reform and will help prevent future abuses from being committed,"" Burt said. ""Reports of ongoing violence and street protests in Bahrain make clear this is (a) long-term process and more needs to be done."" Rights group Amnesty International called Friday for al-Khawaja's immediate and unconditional release. Phillip Luther, its Middle East and North Africa director, said in a statement: ""The Bahraini authorities have made pledges that they would release people who were imprisoned for exercising their right to freedom of expression, but the continued imprisonment of Abdulhadi al-Khawaja demonstrates that they are not serious about fulfilling such promises."" The rights group considers al-Khawaja a ""prisoner of conscience, detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression,"" and says he began his hunger strike in February to protest his sentence. Last week, the United Nations issued a statement expressing concern about ""the health of human rights defenders who are on hunger strikes in protest against their imprisonment for participating in last year's mass demonstrations."" The state-run Bahrain News Agency published a statement Tuesday from the Ministry of Human Rights and Social Development in response to a critical report by another rights group, Human Rights Watch, that said Bahrain had not lived up to its commitments on reform. The ministry dismissed the criticism as rash, saying that the Human Rights Watch report ""had ignored the positive developments in the country and the continuation of the reform process,"" and that it was committed to the protection of human rights. Demonstrations in Bahrain failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state, backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In November of last year, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report critical of authorities' reactions to the protests, which began in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. The independent commission, set up by Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, found that between February and April of last year, 35 people were killed in unrest there. Demonstrators and Bahraini authorities have continued to clash in recent months, with the opposition accusing the government of using heavy-handed tactics. CNN's Samira Said and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Bahrain must do more to ensure reform and prevent abuses, UK Foreign Office says .

"(CNN) -- Are you ready for some football? You may not be as ready as you think if you're planning to have folks over to watch the Baltimore Ravens face off against the San Francisco 49ers in New Orleans on February 3. All any Super Bowl party needs is a television, chips and dip and a cooler full of brewskies, right? Well, don't start Kaepernicking in victory quite yet. While event planning professionals agree those are key ingredients, they say that trinity is not necessarily all it takes to throw a party worthy of a touchdown dance. Just ask Bill Furtkevic and Stephen Pino from Party City. Aside from a big screen for the big game and a table with food and drink, they offered a slew of other essential components for stylish Super Bowl soirée. Eye-catching decor, a unique menu, custom entertainment, wearable favors and fun invitations can make your party stand out from the standard last NFL season hurrah, Pino said. The Super Bowl is the second-largest food consumption holiday of the year, according to the USDA, behind Thanksgiving and ahead of Christmas Day. Stadiums sculpted out of meat products or complicated dishes that won't be savored during a gripping game might not give hosts the bang for their buck that they're hoping for. The Food Network's Sandra Lee, known as much for her tablescapes as for her creative use of packaged food, advises, ""think 'do-able,' and take smart and simple shortcuts when possible."" Although team loyalty can divide a party, a welcoming buffet spread can unite it. Use what you have at hand to present the burgers, hot dogs, chips and dip in a creative way, said Atlanta party planner April Trigg, founder of Eventologie. ""Go get your kids' footballs and put them on the table,"" Trigg said. ""Anything like that that you already have in your house, why not put it on your buffet tables? You've got instant party."" Natural turf is another easily accessible accessory. Go outside and dig up some grass to decorate your Super Bowl tabletop, Trigg recommends. The food, too, can be great décor. Trigg offers guests guacamole served in avocado halves, reminiscent of the shape of a football. Lee said she takes at least two weeks to plan casual gatherings in order to give herself enough time to shop for the best decorations and centerpieces. Her party supplies for a Super Bowl shindig might include team color tablecloths, pom-poms, cheer sticks, craft paper and Astro Turf, she wrote in an e-mail. Trigg and Lee agree that, aside from great decorations, hosts should consider who's coming to the party and how they might commune. Lee calls this the ""energy of the room."" To keep the party exciting, Trigg plans games for kids (such as a best team cheer contest) and competitive BBQ throwdowns for the adults. Pino suggests turning the big game into a party game. Provide guests with penalty flags to throw during the famously high-concept commercials. ""Bad commercial! Bad commercial!"" he shouted with glee. Not everyone will be glued to the tube or the grill the entire time, Trigg said. She makes sure to provide multiple areas for guests to mingle. ""The Super Bowl is more than just football,"" Lee wrote. ""It's a fun celebration, and everyone can appreciate that."" ""At the end of the day, it might not be your favorite team in that last final game, but it's more about bringing your friends and family together, honoring that tradition,"" said Trigg, whose Atlanta Falcons just missed out on a trip to the big game New Orleans this year. ""Guests come to the party to watch the game AND see the host,"" Lee wrote. To that end, hosts should dress the part. A team-colored feather boa or tutu helps make Super Bowl party photos truly memorable, Furkavic said. Party City also stocks photo booth kits for the Instagram crowd. If you're not interested in buying a bunch of themed favors and prefer to have your party leave a small environmental footprint, that's possible, too. Trigg, who plans small gatherings as well as big blowouts, finds ways to make her events environmentally sustainable. She reuses materials as much as she can when planning and decorating, and uses compostable paper plates and cups at her parties, as well as recyclable cutlery. No matter what kind of Super Bowl party you choose to throw, a quick glance at one's homeowner insurance policy is another smart step in the party planning process. Wait, what? It's just a Super Bowl party, right? And yet, according to the American Bar Association, if a guest gets food poisoning, is injured at your home or drives drunk after a party, the host could get sued. It's important for hosts to plan for the unexpected. ""I'm a big proponent of safety,"" Trigg said. She's a fan of the car service Uber -- which can pick you up based on your smartphone's GPS -- for those over-imbibing. ""I like to have it be part of the game, have people drop their keys right away,"" she said. Do you have any clutch tips for throwing an unforgettable Super Bowl party?

"(CNN) -- With first lady Michelle Obama turning 50, we asked some of our 50-and-older CNN colleagues: ""If you could go back in time, what advice would you give to your 30-year-old self?"" Here's what they had to say: . Carol Costello . Anchor, ""CNN Newsroom"" I wish I could express my honest opinion about articles that deal with the ""dreaded 50"" -- 90% of me thinks recognizing women turning 50 is a tad sexist. We did not make a big deal when President Obama turned 50. We recognized it, but we did not ask the President if he would consider using botox or if he would stop playing basketball. Honestly, I don't think about my age until I read some article telling me I'm not dead. Then, I begin bitching about why I must be ""sexy"" at 50 -- or a cougar who yearns for a man I would have to financially support. It's funny. Attractive women fight to be taken seriously in their 20s, then yearn to ""not be taken seriously"" in their 50s. At least that's what all those articles tell me. With that in mind, what would I tell 30-year-old Carol Costello? 1. OMG EAT! That old adage that you can never be too thin is bogus. And so not fun. 2. Having been fired in my 30s, don't worry.

Politics and public service is the most exciting, fulfilling career imaginable. Stay with it. 2. Even the most exciting, fulfilling career is bulls*** compared to being a father. 3. Just because someone is on the other side of a political fight, that does not make them a bad person. Try harder to find your common humanity, even as you beat their brains out politically. 4. Make sure to answer the phone when the governor of Arkansas calls. Anthony Bourdain . Host of ""Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown"" I doubt very much that my 30-year-old self would have listened -- even to my materialized 57-year-old self. But I guess if I could send a message or three, it would go something like this: . 1. It gets better. Really. 2. Cocaine is not going to make you happy. 3. But feel free to f*** up as much as you like because, apparently, it will all pay off in the end. Donna Brazile . Political contributor . 1. Your health is your wealth. 2. Living well is aging well, as in eating right and plenty of exercise. 3. And stay positive. Joy cometh in the morning. Joe Johns . Senior Washington correspondent . 1. If you can find three people in your professional life you can rely on and trust to give you advice, counsel and sound judgment, value them. 2. Get rid of the mustache. It will come back to haunt you! 3. Life is not a sprint, it's a marathon. Richard Quest . International business correspondent and host of ""Quest Means Business"" 1. Life is a long rat race, not a short sprint. Pace yourself. You will still win if you take a bit longer. 2. Money may not buy happiness, but it buys a very nice misery. Just don't worship it. 3.

"Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (CNN) -- It was impossible not to be deeply moved by Harun Calehr when he and his family joined Chris Cuomo live on ""New Day"" on Wednesday. You see, up until that moment we had been detached. We may have seen the bodies of the dead scattered across the Eastern Ukrainian countryside, distorted, rotting, a dog running from the crash site with something in its mouth. Seen the scattered belongings, many strangely intact, the house keys, the Bali travel guide, the child's toy perched on top of the wreckage, retrieved by a villager from where it had fallen from the sky. We may have dashed along potted roads, finding new routes to avoid the shelling, pleading with the sun not to fall so we could be safer. Through check point after check point, guns aimed at us. Convoys of tanks and artillery on those same roads, belonging to both sides and wondered their destination, purpose and origin. We may have sat across from the self-appointed Prime Minister of his self-declared Republic and asked him if he and his men, so many of whom are from Russia, had shot down the plane. Eye to eye, asked him if he was backed, armed and incited by Russia. And we joined the OSCE monitors as they gathered around the train being used to transport the dead from this militia controlled so called Republic, and balked with them at the stench, the hacking, repulsive, gut wrenching smell as the refrigerated train door opened to reveal desperate, bagged and reeking cargo.

"Washington (CNN) -- Inside La Clínica del Pueblo's adobe-colored confines, William Joachin works furiously to help the dozens of Spanish-speaking patients who queue up weekly seeking help registering for Obamacare. He logs into DC Health Link, the local insurance exchange, and his fingers click rapidly on the computer keys as he enters information into page after page while translating questions and answers into Spanish for families whose members often each have a different immigration status. ""Si,"" he tells them, the son who was born here qualifies for coverage under Obamacare. No, the El Salvadoran-born mom who has a green card and has been here for only two years, will not qualify for Medicaid until she has been in the U.S. five years. For hours he sorts through and translates the complicated questions and answers. He presses enter. All of the information disappears. His heart sinks. Then he begs for patience and begins the process anew. Welcome to Obamacare en Español. The Obama administration is banking on the support of the Hispanic community, with its large numbers of young and uninsured, to help make the President's signature health care reform law a success. ""The population we serve is the most difficult,"" Joachim said, adding that it often takes several hours and a couple of visits to get an entire family signed up because of technical difficulties and the complexities of enrolling families of mixed immigration status. Joachim's challenges echo problems faced nationally by Spanish speakers when they try to enroll in the signature Obama administration program designed to serve as a safety net for millions of uninsured Americans. Efforts to register Spanish speakers are further complicated by technical problems on Obamacare-related websites, worries that information might be used for deportation purposes, problems verifying income, and a digital divide among those who might not have ready access to a computer said Alejandra Gepp, associate director of La Raza's Institute for Hispanic Health. ""Enrollment is happening, but it's been a very slow process for a number of reasons,"" Gepp said. ""Latinos were uninformed and there's a mistrust issue because they are mistrustful of government and there was so much information out there in the media they didn't know what they should believe."" Who's signing up for Obamacare? Support among the Hispanic community is critical to the Obama administration's efforts. Roughly half of the nation's Hispanics are under the age of 26 and they are in a good position to pay into insurance pools, while being less likely, because of their relative youth, to draw from them, leaving premium funds available to help pay for health care for older, sicker participants. Hispanics account for roughly 17% of the population, but they make up 32% of the country's uninsured who aren't elderly, according to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an organization which conducts health policy research. ""Disproportionately we are being counted on to sustain this program,"" said Daniel Garza, executive director of the Libre Initiative, a nonpartisan, nonprofit grassroots Hispanic advocacy organization. ""We are a heavy chunk of the folks who are being expected to sign up. "" But when Spanish speakers want to sign up for Obamacare in their own language, they face problems. On www.cuidadodesalud.gov, the Spanish language version of HealthCare.gov, sometimes links led to dead ends or pages in English. In other instances, some words and phrases are literal translations from English to Spanish, which health advocates in the Hispanic community say makes the site difficult to understand. ""To put up a website that is only cosmetic it's disrespectful of this administration,"" Garza said. ""If you're going to have a website, have it work, for the love of God."" After media reports and questions by CNN, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees both the sites, has addressed a number of hyperlink-related problems on the website. The Spanish language site did not launch until December 6 -- a full two months late and after its English language counterpart debuted. This means Spanish speakers have a much shorter window to browse online to make health care choices before the March 31 deadline for enrollment. Unlike their English speaking counterparts, Spanish speakers still cannot shop for insurance plans on the website. ""It is very disappointing that it is taking so long to get this critical element on the Spanish website,"" Gepp said. U.S. drops contractor for work on Obamacare website . Despite calls among some Hispanic advocacy groups to extend that deadline given the Spanish language website's delayed launch and inability to purchase plans online, Health and Human Services officials said they are unaware of any plans to do so. Some Hispanic advocacy groups say the Obama administration has given their community short shrift in its health care rollout . HHS decided to delay enrollment on CuidadoDeSalud.gov until they fixed the massive technical glitches on the problem-plagued English version, agency officials said. ""To make sure that Spanish-speaking consumers have the best possible consumer experience, we launched the consumer tools on CuidadoDeSalud.gov as we made upgrades to the site,"" HHS spokesman Aaron Albright said in a statement. ""The technical components of both websites go hand-in-hand and we were mindful that launching both websites simultaneously may possibly have exacerbated the problems. The soft launch has allowed us to identify areas of concerns early and ensure the best product possible."" HHS also points out that Spanish-speakers can enroll on the phone with bilingual staffers. Since October 1, there have been more than 330,000 Spanish calls, which represents 4% of overall call volume, according to the agency. Spanish speakers can also fill out a paper application in that language. The administration is also relying heavily on bilingual specialists at community organizations, libraries and local health centers to help get people signed up. The administration says it does not yet have figures on the number Spanish speakers who have enrolled in Obamacare thus far or a breakdown of those enrollments by state. However, recent enrollment figures of the overall population show that only one in four young adults between the ages of 18 and 34 have signed up for insurance plans under Obamacare. California, Florida, and Texas -- states with some of the nation's biggest Spanish speaking populations -- show similar figures. The administration reiterated on the website and to community assistants who help Spanish-speakers enroll that ""information provided by applicants or beneficiaries won't be used for immigration enforcement purposes."" And the Obama administration is redoubling efforts to boost Hispanic enrollment. ""In my opinion the Affordable Care Act is the single most life-saving act this country has had,"" Jose Luna, a physician in El Paso, Texas, stressed in a recent telephone news conference organized by the White House. Others are taking a wait and see approach. ""The good news is Latinos are being enrolled,"" Gepp said. ""Not at the rate we would like to see. Let's see what happens from now to March 31.""

"Paris (CNN) -- This is a country which says races don't exist: there is only the human race, to which we all belong. This is a country which, unlike the U.S. and Britain, has purposefully limited freedom of speech in order to criminalize verbal violence and incitement to hatred in all its forms. But this is also a country where the black justice minister Christiane Taubira is welcomed by a child with the words ""Hey, guenon [monkey], go and eat bananas!"" The 12-year-old girl who uttered those words in the town of Angers on October 25 had come with her parents to protest against the same-sex marriage law of which the minister has become a symbol. In the crowd of protesters were a dozen children shouting the word guenon; their parents looked pleased, proud even. And we thought, naively, and rather condescendingly, that this sort of racist abuse could only be found in a country like Italy, ethnically less diverse than France. We all remembered Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi repeatedly describing U.S. President Barack Obama as ""really much tanned"". We all remembered, earlier this year, Congo-born Cecile Kyenge, Italy's first ever black minister, having bananas thrown at her. Italian senator Roberto Calderoli even referred to her as ""having the features of an orangutan."" We thought such coarse xenophobia could not take place here. No, surely not in France! How wrong we were. It actually took many of us by surprise. The fact that parents asked their children to hurl racist abuse at a government minister added to the sense of shock. As explained in a timelime in French weekly L'Express', it actually took days for the French political class to react to the racist insults endured by Taubira. Why such dithering? Some were embarrassed; others feared they might exacerbate the current tension in France if they made too big a fuss. The same sex marriage legal battle which raged on last year seems to have reopened a box we thought long shut: France has witnessed the resurgence of a far-right alliance between traditionalist Catholics and ultra-conservatives who suddenly see themselves as the new revolutionaries. At night, they dream of insurrection. It has sometimes felt like being thrown back in time, to the 1930s. On November 13, however, Minute, an extreme-right publication which ran the monkey analogy on its front page, was formally investigated for racism, and Interior Minister Manuel Valls said he was looking at blocking the distribution of the magazine. ""We cannot let this pass,"" he said. ""This is not just Christiane Taubira who has been attacked for her color. It is the Republic, it is France and its values that are under attack."" For the Paris-based Moroccan poet and writer Tahar Ben Jelloun, in an open letter called ""Racism, the ultimate temptation"" and published in the Italian daily La Repubblica on November 15: ""Everywhere in Europe, we see the resurgence of racism. It may only be words but it could end with the gas chambers."" According to Jelloun, France is no more racist than its neighbors but the real problem is that, today, racism finds an ideal breeding ground on social networks where anonymity unleashes unrestrained violence. In a famous recent case, the French justice system, often harsher on verbal violence than many other countries, has tried to stop Twitter from serving as a platform for all kinds of xenophobic abuses presented as ""jokes."" In October 2012, racist hashtags in French such as #IfMyDaughterComesHomeWithABlack or #AGoodJew unleashed the worse examples of unrestrained racism. In France, racial insults in public are punishable by up to six months in jail and fines of up to â‚¬25,000; French justice was determined to sanction the xenophobic twitterati. At first, Twitter told the French justice it could not reveal its users' identities and would only obey the laws of California where it was based. But French judges argued -- successfully -- that the targeted public and the racist perpetrators were French-speakers operating from France. Twitter eventually complied to reveal the identity of those who had generated racist tweets so they could be prosecuted in France: A victory. French judges should now turn their attention to the French parents who teach their children to shout racist insults at a government minister born in French Guyana. Punitive sentences would be welcome. As would the end of anonymity on social networks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Agnes Poirier.","France's justice minister Christine Taubira the target of racist taunts and abuse .

"(CNN) -- J.K Rowling has recast her ""Harry Potter"" magic and reportedly brought Dumblebore back to life. A spokesperson for the author confirms Rowling sent a letter and a package to a Texas teenager who optimistically found strength in the words of a ""Harry Potter"" film after witnessing the murder of her immediate family. Fifteen-year-old Cassidy Stay lost both parents and four siblings to a gunman in Texas last month. Cassidy was shot in the head and survived the gunshot wound only because she played dead. Authorities have called her survival a miracle. Cassidy had seen the unimaginable, but was still thinking about happiness. At a memorial for her family, Cassidy gave a speech in front of media saying she believed her family was ""in much a better place."" Quoting the words of Dumbledore, the wise headmaster of Hogwarts, she said ""Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light."" Sole survivor in Texas shooting looks for hope amid her horror . The same day Cassidy gave her speech, a Facebook page called ""We want JK Rowling to meet Cassidy Stay"" formed and quickly gained traction. While the group page acknowledges that Cassidy is not a follower of the page, the creator claims to know a friend of Cassidy's who ""confirmed that JK Rowling did, in fact, write her a personalized letter from 'Dumbledore' (hand-written with purple ink). She was also sent a wand, an acceptance letter to Hogwarts with a school supply list, along with the 3rd book with JK's autograph"" the group post said. Rowling's spokesperson told CNN: ""We can confirm that J.K.

"(CNN) -- What was supposed to be a straightforward cash deal to carry a child for desperate parents has turned into an international spat over who said what, and exposed the darker side of a business credited with creating happiness for many couples. At the center of the debate is Gammy, a seven-month-old Down Syndrome baby with a congenital heart condition who is currently receiving treatment for a lung infection at a private hospital in Thailand. For days, Gammy's surrogate mother, 21-year-old Thai food stall worker Pattharamon Chanbua, has been telling local and foreign press that the couple abandoned their son, taking home his healthy sister. After initially denying they knew about baby Gammy, a friend of the couple issued a statement to a local Australian newspaper saying the pair only left Gammy because they were told he was likely to die. ""Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,"" the unnamed friend told the Bunbury Mail, in Western Australia, where the couple live. Fear and lies . The friend said the surrogate mother gave birth at a different hospital to the one agreed upon, which made the surrogacy agreement void. The couple was scared, she said, that Pattharamon would change her mind about the second child, and they'd have to leave Thailand with no children at all. According to the report, the friend noted that the backdrop to the surrogacy row was a military coup in the country and ""it was very difficult to get around."" The takeover took place in the early hours of May 22, 2014 when Commander of the Royal Thai Army General Prayuth Chan-chua announced in a national broadcast he was now in charge. ""This has been absolutely devastating for them, they are on the edge,"" the friend added, referring to the days of media scrutiny and debate over their decision, months after they returned home. Pattharamon claimed the couple asked her to terminate the Down Syndrome child when she was seven months pregnant. Not true, the couple's friend said. After the babies' birth, Pattharamon claimed they bought nappies and milk for the baby girl, but ""didn't even look at the boy."" Also a lie, the friend added. Whatever the details of who said what, the case has attracted attention to a largely unregulated industry subject to a confusing tangle of laws and loopholes. Surrogate 'is legal parent' In the state of Western Australia, where the couple is from, it's legal to seek surrogacy abroad. There are no checks for criminal history, and no counseling is required for couples seeking offshore surrogacy, said Jenni Millbank, an expert in Australian surrogacy law from the University of Technology in Sydney. ""If surrogacy were taken onshore there would be counseling protocols prior to conception, as well as a welfare report after birth required before legal parentage is transferred; but these are not steps that occur with offshore surrogacy,"" said Millbank. She said the surrogate mother is the legal parent regardless of whose egg was used. The rights of the genetic father are also ""uncertain"" as ""different judges have taken varied approaches,"" she said. Australian authorities are looking into the case, as are Thai authorities, who had already announced a crackdown on the industry amid claims rules were being flouted. Pattharamon said she agreed to be paid 300,000 baht ($9,300) for carrying the couple's babies, money she needed to help care for her own two children, aged six and three. After she voiced concerns about how she was going to pay for Gammy's care, funds started flowing to an online campaign, which to date has raised more than $237,000 (US$220,000). Could baby girl be returned? Pattharamon said she's prepared to take the baby girl back if the Australian couple is are ""not ready"" to take care of her. She said she doesn't intend to pursue legal action against the parents, though Millbank says she could apply to the Family Court of Australia to have the child returned. ""The Family Court of Australia has jurisdiction over anyone who has an interest in the care, welfare and a development of a child so (the intending parents) could still make their case and argue for the baby to live with them,"" Millbank said. ""The court would examine the competitive proposals of the parties, probably appoint an independent children's lawyer and do a welfare assessment of the child's needs and then make a decision."" The Australian courts have only ever heard one case involving a child born via surrogacy, Millbank said. It involved a child called ""Evelyn"" whose birth was the result of an agreement between friends that went wrong. ""That was in the 1980s and they ended up removing the child from the family that had been raising her and taking her to the other family,"" Millbank said. ""It was an altruistic arrangement where the birth mother changed her mind about seven months later. And she ultimately won. She got the child back.""","Australian couple say they were told male twin, Gammy, would die .

"(CNN) -- Eccentric former basketball star Dennis Rodman may not have brought imprisoned American Kenneth Bae back with him from North Korea, but he did emerge with something to announce. Along with representatives from Paddy Power, an online betting company, he will put together a ""basketball diplomacy"" event involving players from North Korea, he said Monday. At a news conference, he called Kim Jong Un, ruler of the repressive state, a ""very good guy."" Rodman also set tongues wagging over the weekend by leaking the purported name of Kim's baby daughter. Returning from his second trip to the reclusive, nuclear-armed nation, Rodman gave an interview Sunday with The Guardian, a British newspaper, in which he described the ""relaxing time by the sea"" he spent with Kim and his family. 'A good dad' The personal life of Kim and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, is shrouded in secrecy. Even his exact age remains unconfirmed by outsiders. (He is believed to be in his early 30s.) Speculation sprang up last year that Ri might be pregnant after a photo carried by state media showed her wearing a long coat that could have been hiding a bump. But North Korean authorities kept quiet about the matter. The flamboyant Rodman, 52, shed more light on the situation in his Guardian interview, including the daughter's name. ""I held their baby Ju Ae and spoke with Ms. Ri as well,"" he told the newspaper. He described Kim, who sits atop one of the world's most repressive regimes, as ""a good dad."" Ruling dynasty . The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for three generations. Kim Jong Un follows his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung. The regime has pursued the development of nuclear weapons while millions of its subjects have been left impoverished and malnourished. It's a little early to start speculating whether Ju Ae is a likely heir to her father, said Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in South Korea. Lankov, the author of the recent book ""The Real North Korea,"" said the question of succession was unlikely to arise for at least another 30 years, assuming Kim Jong Un remains healthy. ""And I don't believe the North Korean monarchy is going to last another 30 years,"" he said. If it does, Kim and Ri are young enough to have several other children in the meantime. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they have five more,"" he said. A big announcement? Rodman has so far made no mention on his Twitter account of his bonding time with the Kim family. But he suggested late Sunday something was afoot. ""Just returned from North Korea. HUGE announcement tomorrow morning in NYC,"" he said in a post. It was unclear what he was specifically referring to. The Guardian reported on his plans to organize a basketball game between American and Korean teams. American still imprisoned . Rodman had already poured cold water on speculation he might have been trying to secure the release of Bae, the U.S. citizen serving a 15-year sentence of hard labor in North Korea. ""It is not my job to talk about Kenneth Bae,"" he told reporters at the Beijing airport on Saturday. ""Ask Obama about that, ask Hillary Clinton about that,"" Rodman said. ""Ask those ---holes."" Rodman had previously made no secret about his desire to help Bae, who has been transferred to a hospital after his health deteriorated. The retired NBA player once tweeted that he wanted Kim to ""do him a solid"" by freeing the American prisoner. But Rodman's friendship with Kim, an avid basketball fan, doesn't appear to carry enough weight to get Bae out of jail. U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korean officials to release Bae, who was convicted earlier this year of attempting to bring down the government. Pyongyang last month abruptly withdrew an invitation to a U.S. envoy who was to travel there to try to secure Bae's release. Previous criticism . Rodman was criticized over his first visit to North Korea, in February, during which he was pictured laughing and eating while watching a basketball game with Kim. That visit came during a period of escalating tensions in which North Korea threatened missile strikes on the United States and South Korea. The situation has gradually calmed over recent months. In his comments to The Guardian on Sunday, Rodman, one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history, continued to defend the North's young leader. ""Kim is a great guy, he loves basketball, and he's interested in building trust and understanding through sport and cultural exchanges,"" he said. CNN's K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Basketball diplomacy"" event announced .

"(CNN) -- During a family trip to the beach last month, 4-year-old Paul Franklin fell and scraped his right knee. That's not unusual; little boys do all the time. It's what emerged from his swollen knee that makes this a tale worth telling: a snail. Paul of Aliso Viejo, California, was walking along the beach when he dinged his knee against a rock. ""We just cleaned it up, put a Band-Aid on it,"" his father, Ken Franklin, told CNN affiliate KCAL. ""Before you know it, a couple weeks later, his knee was very swollen and somewhat infected."" A doctor told Paul's mom, Rachael, that it might be a nasty staph infection. Antibiotics helped, but there was a growing black bump underneath the skin. Tired of waiting and certain the wound needed to be drained, the mom decided to take matters into her own hands. She squeezed it with her fingers and out it popped. ""It looked like a rock. It was a black thing,"" she told the station. ""I put it on a paper towel and I'm like, 'That is a weird looking rock. It has swirls on it,' and I turn it over and it is a sea snail.""

"(CNN) -- Israel's ongoing military operation in Gaza -- Protective Edge -- has animated the Shia Islamist leadership in Tehran. The bloody conflict, and the global Muslim outrage it has provoked, is held by the Iranian regime as a chance to redeem itself in the eyes of the Sunni Muslim majority in the world. When Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei this week called on the ""Muslim Nation"" to set aside differences and unite against Israel, he was in fact pitching Iranian leadership. Other Muslim leaders speak in such terms. The difference is Iran has the capacity to militarily make a difference by resuming arms supplies to Hamas. As Khamenei and other Iranian leaders intensify the call to arm Hamas, the political reward they seek is hard to miss. On the geopolitical map of the Middle East, the Gaza conflict offers an opportunity for Tehran to perhaps start reversing a trend for Iran to be seen as a Shia power -- thanks to its support for the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war -- and go back to what it prefers most: to carry the pan-Islamist banner and offer itself as the principal guardian of Muslim causes. The beleaguered Hamas -- Iran's one-time favorite Sunni surrogate -- might not have an alternative but to return to Tehran's orbit after a four-year freeze in relations. Senior security officers from the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Ramallah in the West Bank are keeping a very close eye on the Iran-Hamas dynamics. Officials in the PA, dominated by Hamas' secular rivals from the Fatah movement, fear that Iran extending its hand to Hamas will only embolden it and prolong this latest military round with Israel. At the same time, officials from the PA detect a strong tendency among Hamas leaders to be open to Tehran's conditions for a resumption of Iranian assistance should Tehran decide to forgive Hamas for its 2011 betrayal. That is when Hamas chose to back the Syrian opposition against the Tehran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad and thus left Iran's orbit after nearly two-decades of Iranian patronage. According to one PA official, ""Hamas has no other option except to return to its Iranian sponsor."" As he put it, ""Iran's relations with Hamas were from the outset tactical"" and the present circumstances make reconciliation beneficial to both. Hamas can look forward to the resumption of Iranian arms. Tehran can hope to turn the global Muslim attention to its role as a protector of Palestinians, a development that serves its regional agenda given the unpopularity of Iranian support for Assad in Syria among Muslim public opinion. In reality, Tehran never entirely cut Hamas loose after the debacle over Syria. According to a senior PA official, Hamas' political contacts with Iran were largely frozen but the military relationship has continued throughout. Tehran never shut the door to the radical line of Hamas leaders, including Mahmoud al-Zahar in Gaza, and Imad al-Alami, the former representative of Hamas to Iran. Other Hamas chiefs did not receive this Iranian benevolence. Khaled Meshaal, the one-time Damascus-based political face of Hamas who relocated to Qatar in 2011, has -- according to Iranian media -- tried unsuccessfully for the last three years to make a visit Tehran. He was kept at bay but there is now speculation that Tehran might be willing to receive Meshaal. If so, it might just be the beginning of the end of the Hamas-Iran fallout over Syria. The groundwork for such a visit might already be in place. Soon after Israel launched its latest campaign against Hamas in Gaza, the influential speaker of Iran's parliament, Ali Larijani, was on the phone with Meshaal. A few days later, the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif called, each promising Tehran's support. Hezbollah of Lebanon, the jewel in Iran's Arab crown, has also opened the door to Hamas. Palestinian reports suggest that the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a militant movement close to Iran that unlike Hamas stayed loyal to Tehran over its support for Assad in Syria, is now mediating between Hamas and Hezbollah. The head of PIJ, Abdullah Shallah, is said to personally lead the effort, which has included a phone conversation between Hassan Nasrallah and Meshaal. Last week, Nasrallah gave an impassioned speech where he pledged ""Hezbollah and the Lebanese resistance will stand by the Palestinian peoples' uprising,"" but he has thus far resisted Hamas' call for it to open a northern front against Israel."" With Hezbollah fighters still in action in Syria in support of the Assad regime, and with memories fresh of Hamas' support for the Syrian opposition, and given Nasrallah's delicate domestic policy agenda in Beirut, a northern front is very doubtful in this round of fighting. Still, Iran and Hezbollah can deliver weapons and military know-how, something that other Hamas backers -- such as Qatar and Turkey -- are unable or unwilling to do. As Major General Saeb al-Ajez, the former commander of PA National Security Forces (NSF) put it, Hamas needs to return to the Iranian orbit as it desperately needs military replenishment. Palestinian sources believe that Meshaal's visit to Tehran likely will happen once a ceasefire with Israel has been agreed. He is expected to thank Tehran for its support and use the visit as a public pronouncement that the Hamas-Iran spat is finally over. A visit to Tehran by Meshaal, however, is still entangled in the geopolitical mess that is today's Middle East. Meshaal's closest regional allies, Qatar, where he lives, and Turkey, are still at loggerheads with Tehran over competition for influence in Syria and increasingly in Iraq. As a way to bypass this hindrance, Tehran will no longer insist that Hamas publicly support the Assad regime in Syria but only to refrain from publicly criticizing his rule. According to Palestinian sources in the West Bank, Hamas is willing to make this compromise with Tehran.","Gaza has provoked outrage in the Muslim world, write Alex Vatanka and Mohammed Najib .

"(CNN) -- After being sued for sexual harassment, a Yahoo executive is countersuing a former employee who leveled the original accusations against her. While the stakes of the sexual harassment claim are large, the underlying facts are actually quite common in this variety of litigation. Former software engineer Nan Shi filed a complaint against the executive, Maria Zhang, accusing her of coercing Shi into sex, and threatening to fire Shi. Zhang and Yahoo's defense is that Shi fabricated the entire story. Yahoo says she is an underperformer who received negative performance evaluations. There is perhaps no area of the law where we have failed to educate our citizenry more than sexual harassment. Every lawyer has fielded a call from a potential client or family member, who believes fervently that they are victims of ""harassment,"" ""discrimination"" or a ""hostile work environment."" That may be true. But, there is a huge difference between the common usage of these words and the legal definition. The vast majority of what employees personally consider ""harassment"" bears little resemblance to the kind of harassment that is legally actionable. Federal and state law, and in the Yahoo case, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act prohibits discrimination and harassment against an employee based on sex (among other things). There are two types of sexual harassment: hostile work environment sexual harassment and quid pro quo sexual harassment. Hostile work environment is far more popular in that people often believe their workplace is hostile because their boss is a jerk, or he ""has it out for them."" But, as the Supreme Court has famously said, discrimination laws are not a ""general civility code for the American workplace."" In the Yahoo case, the plaintiff is alleging the other kind of harassment. Quid pro quo harassment is rarer, but potentially easier to prove. Quid pro quo means ""this for that."" Simply put, a plaintiff must prove that a boss first made unwanted sexual advances or engaged in other unwanted sexual conduct. The plaintiff must also prove either that job benefits were conditioned on acceptance of those sexual advances or that employment decisions were based on his/her acceptance or rejection of the boss' conduct. As one can imagine, it's far more common for people to allege that they work in a generally sexually charged atmosphere than to allege that a boss made a concrete sexual advance, with a clear ""or else"" condition attached to it. From an evidence standpoint, however, quid pro quo harassment has more ""smoking gun"" potential. This is because a single instance of quid pro quo sexual harassment may be actionable. On the other hand, a single incident of hostile work environment sexual harassment will not justify a lawsuit, unless it's really bad. It makes sense: If the boss sends you an e-mail saying: ""Meet me in the supply room for hanky-panky if you want that promotion,"" then you've established the overture with one e-mail. On the other hand, e-mailing or telling a lewd joke may be offensive in one person's cubicle, but hilarious in the other's. It makes sense that hostile work environment requires more severe, pervasive behavior, or else the legitimate claims would be overwhelmed by the ""can't take a joke"" plaintiffs. In the Yahoo case, the plaintiff has alleged actual sexual contact, which the executive denies. Even in cases where there is a consensual relationship, there can still be actionable sexual harassment. This commonly happens where the office romance ends, and the demotions begin. So, even if there was a prior relationship, the plaintiff here could potentially prevail on a harassment claim. If Shi fabricated the allegations, as the defendants assert, then that would be a bold and brassy lie. But it wouldn't be unique. Defendants in these cases frequently claim the plaintiff conjured up harassment just to save their job after substandard performance reviews. It becomes a high-stakes chicken-and-egg game: Were the negative reviews a conspiracy to cover up the harassment? Or was the harassment made up to cast doubt on the reports of underperformance? Only time—and a jury—will tell. According to California law, all employers must take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment. At least some of those reasonable steps include that sign we've all seen over the coffee machine in the break room, the one that basically says ""Sexual Harassment is Bad."" In California, that's a poster distributed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Increasingly, it seems, we're becoming a nation of anemic warning signs instead of concerted action. Do we actually believe an executive planning to accost and grope his secretary in the file room will rethink his intentions after reading a poster hung over the water cooler? California employers have a duty and a financial incentive to investigate these claims, because employers are often held strictly—or automatically—liable for a lecherous supervisor. Yahoo allegedly conducted an investigation and cleared Maria Zhang. In California, an employer's duties in responding to allegations include conducting an immediate inquiry, encouraging a written complaint, and protecting the employee from retaliation. It's true that human resources is oft-criticized for siding with management against employees, but if Yahoo feels confident enough to keep backing Zhang, that suggests its internal investigation revealed no wrongdoing. Ultimately, actionable sexual harassment claims are a fraction of the total charges filed with the EEOC and state agencies. This is because the public misunderstands the high burden on a plaintiff to prove sexual harassment. It takes a lot to prove an employer's conduct transcended ordinary office nastiness into illegal harassment. The recent story of the Chicago area employer who limits bathroom breaks to six minutes a day reminds us what we all already knew: There are a lot of lousy workplaces, evil bosses and cruel co-workers. Unfortunately, the vast majority of us have a perfectly legal—if not pleasant—work environment.","Danny Cevallos: A Yahoo exec is being sued for sex harassment, but denies charges .

"(CNN) -- Obamacare expands access to health insurance for tens of millions of people come January 1. Dental care for adults, however, is not included, and experts say we've got a potential oral health care crisis coming. Studies show that people who have insurance are more likely to get regular dental care. But only about 2% of older Americans have dental insurance of any kind, according to a new report. ""Until we have an expansion of this kind of coverage, and until we have people really recognizing what this means for their overall health, I do believe we have an unimaginable tragedy on our hands,"" said Beth Truett, president and CEO of Oral Health America. Truett's organization published the report ""State of Decay: Are older Americans coming of age without oral health care?"" which shows that baby boomers -- who have, for the most part, kept their natural teeth -- could be facing some serious oral health problems over the next decade. People with low income and racial and ethnic minorities are particularly vulnerable, according to the report. How brushing your teeth lowers your risk of cancer . ""It's an issue that is particularly important that is not always talked about,"" said Ira Lamster, dean emeritus of the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine. ""People in the United States are retaining their teeth, and as a result, teeth that have been in use for 50 or 60 or 70 years will have problems."" Neither Medicare nor the Affordable Care Act includes adult dental coverage, although some pediatric dental care is covered. Even the Medigap insurance that adults buy to expand their plans' benefits still won't cover dental procedures. Less than 1% of dental services are covered by Medicare. And neglected dental health can turn into even bigger medical issues. ""For instance, if you have diabetes and you have gum disease, your metabolic control will be worse,"" Lamster said. ""There is a lot of data showing that periodontal disease can increase your risk for heart attacks and strokes. There are so many ways this can impact your overall health. That is why regular access to care is so important."" The study put together by Oral Health America ranked states in terms of the oral care their populations receive. Seventeen states received a ""poor"" grade. The states were evaluated on edentulism, which is the fancy word for total loss of teeth. Other factors included community water fluoridation, adult Medicaid coverage, access to dentists and a state oral health plan that addresses older adults. Some states' Medicaid programs cover adult dental care. However, of the 17 states that received a ""poor"" grade for dental care, the majority are led by Republican governors who have refused or are leaning against expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Dental screening that could save your life . Mississippi is ranked the worst. Tennessee and Alabama tied for second to last. The other states rated as ""poor"" are Florida, Arizona, Louisiana, Delaware, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Montana, Kentucky, Maine, Virginia and California. ""Some of this 'poor' care is in direct relation to the economic changes our country has experienced,"" Truett said. ""A lot of it, though, stems from the fact that some people see this as a tangential kind of medical care."" Emergency room visits for dental health have doubled from about a decade ago. In 1999-2000, there were a reported 1 million cases of adults over 65 who went to the ER for dental problems; in 2009-10, there were 2.3 million cases. ""Dental care is extremely expensive, and the older adult will require the more extensive care,"" Lamster said. ""The frustrating part is that we have some great technology now: Dental implants, for instance, work remarkably well, but they are beyond the means of much of the population."" Baby's teeth: What you should know . Not all states fared as badly in the report. Minnesota ranked at the top of the list, with Maryland a close second. ""We wanted to show that there are states that are getting close to having a model kind of care that others could replicate,"" Truett said. According to the report, Minnesota ranks high in terms of communities with fluoridated water, a Medicaid program that covers dental care for adults, a state oral health plan that addresses this population and, perhaps consequently, a low rate of edentulism. The report suggests that Minnesota still needs more dentists to serve its population. There is some good news: The number of federally qualified health centers that provide dental care have increased, and 41 of 50 states have state oral health plans. There is also a bill in Congress that would widen the ACA, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans benefits to include dental health. That legislation, though, is in its very early stages. The OHA also put together a website toothwisdom.org that offers a handy guide on where you can find dental care in your state. It even gives suggestion on transportation options to these caregivers if an older person is unable to drive.

"(CNN) -- Every time Hispanic Heritage Month rolls around, I learn something new about the Latino footprint in the U.S. But until I spoke to Robert Lopez, I never knew how this celebration came to be. In May of 1988, Lopez, former intern for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, was asked to work on a bill that would amend the 1968 federal law, authorized by President Lyndon B. Johnson, to change it from a week to a month-long celebration. Today, Lopez is a veteran journalist who has helped produce award-winning investigative and multimedia projects for the Los Angeles Times, and a social-media expert who has taught reporters, students and academics in the United States, South America, the Caribbean and the Middle East. Lopez said Bettie Baca, executive director of the caucus at the time, said a House version had already been introduced in 1987 by Rep. Esteban Torres but was stalled by two subcommittees. A similar bill passed the Senate and there was support from all 13 Latino members of Congress in the House. Hearing this, Lopez thought getting enough supporters ""would be a slam dunk"" -- until he received pushback from some quarters. ""I got resistance at first. People didn't just didn't want to support commemorative legislation. People said things like, 'Well, why would we do that? Aren't we all American? That's not a thing we want to support,'"" Lopez said. ""I was a bit naive at the time and didn't know what to do, so I asked the Black Caucus to help me out, and we focused on writing 'Dear Colleague' letters to New York, Texas and California."" What we now know as Black History Month originated in 1926, founded by Carter G. Woodson as Negro History Week, but then the celebration was expanded to a month in 1976. President Gerald R. Ford urged Americans to ""seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history."" Lopez asked the Library of Congress to put together a list of notable Latino achievements in order to better sell the bill to other members. ""To me it was a fascinating learning experience. When I went to high school there wasn't Latino studies or Chicano studies,"" Lopez said. ""I knew of some history here and there, but was shocked to learn of all the Latino history in this country from the Congressional Research Service, part of the Library of Congress. ""This bill became a lot about self-discovery,"" Lopez said. He wrote in a piece for the L.A. Times that he learned about such ""notable figures as Bernardo de Galvez, a military officer who aided American colonists in their fight against the British during the Revolutionary War. Then there was Luis Alvarez, who was born in San Francisco and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968."" There was a ticking clock element to Lopez's task. Since this was the second session of the 100th Congress, if the bill didn't pass this time around it would have to be introduced all over again. On an August morning in 1988, Lopez walked into the House gallery in a blazer and tie, watched the bill pass, and the battle was over without any big fuss. ""I had no idea it would be as big as it is today,"" said Lopez. The third-generation Mexican-American grew up in an English-dominant household. His parents were raised in an area of California where you were punished for speaking Spanish, where Mexican immigrants were forced to be ""American"" and assimilate. So Lopez didn't grow up speaking Spanish at home. But that wasn't the case for his two children, who attended Spanish-language immersion schools. Now, America dedicates a month, from September 15 to October 15, to celebrating the culture and traditions of those who trace their roots to Spain, Mexico and the Spanish-speaking nations of Central America, South America and the Caribbean. After speaking to Lopez, I felt a surge of urgency to keep sharing his story. I wonder what would have happened if he hadn't been assigned this project during his internship. What if he hadn't pushed for the bill with his ""Dear Colleague"" letter and phone calls, or even worse, what if the bill had been put on the back burner until the following year? Would we be celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month today? ""I hope Hispanic Heritage Month helps people learn the things I didn't know growing up, the importance of Latinos in our history, and the contributions they've have made,"" Lopez said. ""It's a good way to celebrate our own culture, but also for non-Latinos to be exposed. You can't really understand American history without understanding Latino history.""","Former Washington intern shares story of how Hispanic Heritage Month came to be .
