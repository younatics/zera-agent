"A customer complained about seeing mice scurrying round a sushi restaurant, only to return a week later to find the eatery was still serving customers and more than 10 rodents were running around floors and counters. Craig Dumpleton contacted the chief executive of YO! Sushi after he spotted the animals running round a branch in Baker Street in London one evening when the restaurant was already closed. But despite receiving a reply saying the incident would be investigated 'immediately' and they took any claims seriously. The 33-year-old returned a week later to find that the number had doubled from five to ten and the mice appeared to be  unperturbed. Scroll down for video . Craig Dumpleton spotted mice running round the floors and counters of YO! Sushi in Baker Street in London, returning a week later to find 10 of the animals in the restaurant and recorded the footage on his mobile phone . Mr Dumpleton, a father of two, said: 'The first time my friend saw this movement out the corner of his eye. We thought it was a rat because it was so big. 'We went to take a closer look and it was huge mouse scurrying around between the counters and the serving area in the restaurant. 'There was about five of them. It was disgusting. One was even on the counter top just sitting there. 'They were obviously used to it because we banged on the window and they weren't even bothered. 'I was back there a week later and I couldn't believe it, there was double the amount. They were running all over the place. 'I'd already complained so all I can think is that they just aren't bothered about getting rid of them.' He claims staff had covered part of the windows with black bags or paint after he complained. Mr Dumpleton, 33, recorded footage of the mice scrabbling around the sushi restaurant on his mobile phone . However YO! Sushi said these coverings were put up after pest control were sent in immediately after his first complaint to deal with the problem. Mr Dumpleton, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said he first saw the mice on October 12 after arranging to meet friends at the sushi bar. He got there late, by which time his friends had eaten, and had a post-meal drink with them nearby. On the walk home they looked in through windows of YO! Sushi and saw the mice running across the wooden floor. Craig emailed chief executive Vanessa Hall two days later who replied saying she would 'investigate immediately' and offered him a gift card and a restaurant tour. Mr Dumpleton complained after he claims he twice saw mice running around YO! Sushi in Baker Street, London, but the company said it has completely resolved the problem and sent in pest control immediately . Her email added: 'We take any incident of this nature extremely seriously, working hard on ensuring immediate resolution.' But a week later after his first visit, Craig walked past again and said he saw at least ten mice running around again. He claimed: 'One was going to the toilet in the middle of the restaurant. 'The last thing I want to do is go there for a meal.' YO! Sushi has 76 restaurants in seven countries, with 65 in the UK. A spokesman for YO! Sushi said: 'We operate a very stringent health and safety regime across all our restaurants. We responded immediately to this enquiry in mid-October. 'Our pest control contractors resolved the problem straight away and we also elevated the matter to our landlords and adjoining London Underground. We are now entirely satisfied that the issue has been resolved.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Craig Dumpleton saw mice running over floors and counters of YO!

"The whole of Brazil can breathe a sign of relief after star forward Neymar quickly recovered after going down with an ankle injury during training on Monday. The Barcelona star rolled his ankle during the selecao's training session outside Rio de Janeiro forcing him to receive treatment on the pitch. However, after spending some time on the floor, the World Cup's poster-boy was able to pick himself up and walk gingerly away before firing free kicks into the net. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch the moment Neymar's ankle caused panic in Brazil . Anguish: Neymar looks in real pain as he goes down clutching at his right ankle . Sigh of relief: Neymar looks set to be fit to face Croatia in the World Cup's opening game on Thursday . Nervy moment: Neymar (far left) rolls his right ankle while running in Brazil's evening training session . Meanwhile, Brazil have been paying extra attention to their defence ahead of the opening game. Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari spent part of the team's training session on Monday making adjustments to hisÂ  defensive setup, stopping practice several times to reposition players until he was satisfied. Although Brazil didn't concede a goal in their two warm-up matches, Scolari said he was not completely satisfied with how his squad played defensively. Preparations: Neymar had been playing a full part in the training session up until the injury . Star man: Brazil's hopes at their home World Cup rest squarely on the shoulders of the Barcelona forward . One of the coach's main goals in the last week of preparations was to make sure the team ready defensively in time for the opener. 'We know that if we don't concede goals, our chances to win matches increase, because we know the kind of talent we have in attack,'; said Scolari. 'It's important we are well prepared on defense so we are not caught by surprise.' Right back Daniel Alves acknowledged that Brazil's defence isn't perfect, but said the team is working to improve before the opener. When told that Croatia striker Ivica Olic said he saw spaces in Brazil's defense during the warm-up matches, Alves acknowledged that adjustments still have to be made. Concern: Neymar receives medical attention during a training session at the squad's complex . Pressure: Brazil are just two days away from starting the World Cup in their home nation . Careful: Paulinho (right) and Fernandinho take part during a training session . 'Obviously, if we didn't make mistakes, we would be a perfect team, and that's not possible,' the Barcelona defender said. 'If Olic saw spaces, then we have to make sure we fix that so he can't find them anymore.' The last time Brazil conceded a goal was in a 2-1 win over Chile in a friendly last November. Brazil beat Panama 4-0 and Serbia 1-0 last week in the last two matches before for the opening match in Sao Paulo. 'Physically we are ready, but tactically we still have to adjust a few things,' Scolari said. The coach's other main focus during Monday's training was on set pieces - another area where he said Brazil still needs to improve. Brazil are expected to practice again at its training camp outside Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday before traveling to Sao Paulo later in the day for the opener.","Barcelona star turns his ankle during Brazil training .

"Mothers love them, babies love them, even the family dog loves them - and if you were to peek into the average Australian family's linen closet, you would no doubt find one. The very first blanket that each newborn is wrapped in at most New South Wales hospitals is so popular amongst new parents that they often choose not to give them back. A spokesperson from the Royal Hospital for Women (RHW) in Sydney admitted that it was a common phenomenon that the blankets simply disappeared. The very first blanket that each newborn is wrapped in at most New South Wales hospitals is so popular amongst  parents that they often choose not to give them back . 'It's one of those unfortunate things that happen, some mother really do like them - they just go into the suitcase an no one is any the wiser,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's nothing special about them, but they are quite thick and warm for new born babies. It's just a fact of life that they go walk about.' But for some mothers, the pink, white and blue striped blankets mean the whole world. 'My daughter was in the NICU after she was born, so we spent almost a week in the hospital,' Sydney mother-of-one, Melissa Wilson said. 'She was a winter baby, so the blanket kept her nice and warm and cosy! She was wrapped in it when we took her home and it's now a lovely memento of the first few days of her life.' Ron Marks, who works for the linen supplier Health Share, said the company sends at least 300 of the baby blankets out to numerous New South Wales hospitals each day . However, at least one third never make it back for laundering, Mr Marks said . Other mothers have admitted to sneaking the blankets to their pets in order to accustom them to their newborn's smell and encourage a positive relationship between them. One mum told Kidspot that her child's hospital baby blanket was tucked in beside her father-in-law who had died only a few weeks after proudly becoming a grandfather. Each day over 300 of the baby blankets are delivered to a variety of public hospitals, and a few private hospitals, across New South Wales by Health Share. Many mothers, like Melissa Wilson, admit the take the blankets as a memento of their child's birth . But when they're sent back to the linen provider for laundering, at least one third are missing according to Ron Marks, the senior customer service relationship coordinator at Health Share. Mr Marks said the blankets, known as Bunny Rugs, were a 'high loss item' despite not being an item with a high use. 'We end up needing to put a fair bit back into the circulation,' Mr Marks said of the blankets, which are sourced from a number of different providers. Joanne Coleman, the midwifery unit manager at Sydney's Royal Hospital for Women, said blankets are not the only thing that often go missing in hospitals, adding that hand sanitiser was another popular item . But baby blankets are not the only hospital items that are likely to be found in a patient's home. 'I think it's just like how we use this hand rub here in the hospital and we lose quite a lot of that,' Joanne Coleman, the midwifery unit manager at RHW, told Daily Mail Australia. 'People just seem to think that because we use it at the hospital, that's the way to go. 'Parents also take the blankets, but I don't know why – they're ugly! Although one of the reasons they might be taken is because people don't often come to hospitals prepared to take their newborn home and so when they are taking the baby home, they don't have anything to wrap them in and just take the blanket. 'We have had them sent back to us all laundered and with a thank you note, or sometimes the midwives in our home service program bring them back.'","The first blanket that each newborn is wrapped in at most New South Wales hospitals often gets taken home by parents .

"For the first time ever, two high school students from Florida with Down syndrome were crowned homecoming king and queen. Travjuan Hunter, who goes by Bubba, and his queen Semone Adkins stood in a football field on October 11th in front of all their peers who cheered them on as they were adorned with crowns and handed bouquets of flowers. Bubba proudly wore a black tuxedo and Semone stunned in a floor length sparkly gray dress. The two lucky students were among 12 students at West Orange High in Central Florida competing for the title of homecoming king and queen. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Overjoyed: Semone (left) and Bubba (right) were elated on October 11 when they were voted out of 12 other contestants as the winners of homecoming king and queen at their Florida high school . 'I am so excited, I am so proud of my son,' said Janice Morgan, Bubba's mom to Click Orlando. Morgan added that Semone and Bubba have been lifelong friends and that sharing this moment is truly heart-warming. 'It was a dream come true, because I always knew that she was going to be something great in this world and this is just the beginning for us,' said Karen McNeil, Semone's mom. Today.com reports that both Bubba and Semone were elected separately which means one of them could have won without the other. They won together and they earned it. With 3,800 students at the largest high school in the county voting for them each individually, there's no question that they made a glowing impression among their peers. 'It was something that I can't explain. When they chose Bubba and Semone for the homecoming king and queen, I feel that those kids really proved that they are just like everyone else, and they can do anything any other person can do,' said McNeil. Popular pair: Semone and Bubba's warm energy won over the hearts of the 3,800 students at West Orange High school who cast their votes for the winning duo . Semone told Today.com that she almost chose to have an abortion when she found out her daughter had Down syndrome when she was already seven months pregnant. She's glad the doctor wouldn't allow her to end her difficult pregnancy. Her child before Semone died at just 3-years-old from neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer. McNeil almost lost her own life while giving birth to her beloved daughter Simone. 'When she came out, I was scared to look at her,' McNeil said. 'I wasn't educated about Down syndrome, but then I heard the doctor say, ""She is beautiful.""' Proud parent:  Bubba's mother said she is proud of her son and of his accomplishments and added that he has come a long way after being born prematurely with a small chance of surviving . Always had faith: Semone's mom says she always knew her daughter would do something great someday despite originally wanting to have an abortion when she found out her daughter had Down Syndrome . 'From that point on, I started hemorrhaging and almost died, but I promised God that if he let me live, I would love her and take care of her forever. When I said that, that's when my blood pressure started coming back up.' When Bubba was born prematurely after 23 weeks he weighed less than three pounds. He was kept in a neonatal intensive care unit for nearly two months before he could go home with his family. The king and queen of West Orange High stunned their parents and their peer’s days before the election at the school's talent show as well. Semone danced to Beyonce's hit Single Ladies and then in a romantic finale, Bubba walked out  on stage and put a ring on Semone's finger to Beyonce's singing 'put a ring on it.' The crowd cheered wildly when Bubba then ripped open his shirt to reveal a superman outfit. 'The student body has just embraced them, and all of this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the admiration and respect from the student body,’’ teacher Jim Mattingly, who specializes in working with students with intellectual disabilities. 'It's just been absolutely breath-taking to watch.' Mattingly also went on to tell Today just how popular Bubba is with students at the school. 'The audience went crazy,’' Mattingly said. 'Bubba is just such a popular young man, just so friendly, that everybody just enjoys him, and it doesn’t take long for him to make friends. Semone is a little more reserved, but when she went up on stage in that talent show, she just came alive. She put on a great performance. It was just very inspirational.' Semone's mom said that she was so happy after the event and was so pleased with all the coverage it got that she gets excited every time she sees a news van. “I felt like (the students) accepted her for who she is,' McNeil said about her daughter. 'When she won homecoming queen, I was just really happy that she is here. She’s still so excited from all the coverage that whenever she sees a news van, she jumps up and starts waving. It’s just a time that I’ll never forget.'","Travjuan Hunter, who goes by Bubba, and his queen Semone Adkins were crowned on a football field in front of all their 3,800 peers .

"It is the one glaring omission from an otherwise incomparable medal haul but Lionel Messi is being backed to complete the set at last. No less a judge than Javier Zanetti has studied his countryman’s state of mind in the build-up to Brazil 2014. He is convinced the Argentina captain is about to add World Cup winner to the countless accolades he has gathered down the years with Barcelona. As a veteran of 145 international appearances and two World Cups, Zanetti knows better than most how expectation tends to get the better of Argentina on football’s biggest stage — with attempts to add to their World Cup triumphs of 1978 and 1986 ending in failure. Scroll down for videos... Time to shine: Lionel Messi will win the World Cup with Argentina, according to countryman Javier Zanetti . Club vs country: Lionel Messi has not always performed for Argentina as he has for Barcelona (L) It's time! Former Argentina teammate Javier Zanetti (L) insists Lionel Messi will explode at the World Cup . But the hurt is about to end, according to Zanetti, with Messi ending any argument about his right to be considered the greatest player on the planet. A perception that he underachieves for Argentina has always been held against him but Zanetti, who brought the curtain down on a glittering career at the end of Inter Milan’s latest Serie A campaign at the age of 40, begs to differ. Zanetti said: ‘For me, Messi is the best in the world, for club and country. There is no-one to touch him. He has already demonstrated that and he doesn’t need a World Cup  winner’s medal to prove it. He has won everything with Barcelona and been named Ballon d’Or winner repeatedly. What he does on a football pitch is amazing. ‘No-one should be too surprised if he has dominated for Barca more than he has for Argentina. When you are with the same players every day you develop a telepathic understanding. It’s not so easy when you report every few months and find yourself with players you are not used to playing with. Evergreen: Javier Zanetti continued playing for Italian club Inter Milan until he was 40-years-old . History repeated: Argentina captain Daniel Passarella holds aloft the trophy after winning the 1978 World Cup . Waiting game: Diego Mardona inspired Argentina to their last World Cup win in Mexico 1986 . ‘A lot of top players find it more difficult when they turn out for their country but the signs are that we will see the best of Messi in  Brazil. He was exceptional in the qualifying campaign. The captaincy seems to be bringing something extra out of him. He has terrific strength of character and has been showing real leadership. ‘He has proved himself captain in the best possible way by inspiring all around him and leading by example, and that is going to stand us in good stead. ‘I can see him having an outstanding World Cup. This stage is made for him. I really do think this could be our time and we will see Lionel lifting the trophy.’ If he does, it will have been a long wait for a nation with such an embarrassment of riches, particularly in attack. Zanetti can’t come up with a reason but is adamant it has nothing to do with any clash of egos. World's best! Lionel Messi has won a record four coveted Balon d'Or awards while playing for Barcelona . Same wavelength: Lionel Messi has dominated for Barcelona because of a telepathic understanding with stars . When it was put to him, through an interpreter, he shook his head and said: ‘We have always had a terrific group of players from the point of view of unity and wanting the best for our country. Team spirit has never been an issue in all my years with Argentina. ‘You can look for reasons why we have not always done as well as we should but you can never question our desire or togetherness. It is an absolute privilege, pleasure and honour to be picked to represent Argentina and  everyone feels the same sense of pride when they pull on the jersey. . 'It is not an easy tournament to win, the World Cup. You need a bit of luck and maybe that hasn’t always gone our way. ‘For instance, Marcelo Bielsa was far and away the best coach I played for. His tactical awareness, preparation, man management, everything was spot on. Yet with him in charge we didn’t make it out of the group in 2002. ‘People always say we are one of the favourites, but that is the paradox.’ Warm up: Lionel Messi (C) vies for the ball during a friendly against Slovenia ahead of the World Cup . Reversal of fortune: Lionel Messi has been outstanding during World Cup qualification, despite having a relatively quiet season for Barcelona . No guarantees: Javier Zanetti rates Marcelo Biesla as Argentina's best manager - yet they failed to get out of the group stages at the 2002 World Cup . If the World Cup becomes the main focus of attention in England for the duration of the finals,  Zanetti insists it is nothing  compared to his homeland. ‘Every time it comes round, the whole of Argentina grinds to a standstill,’ he said. ‘If you think there is a burden of expectation on the England players’ shoulders, you should see what it is like for our boys. ‘It doesn’t matter what has gone before, there is an expectation, almost a demand, that we win it. Passion: Argentina supporters crowd around the team bus as it takes players to the airport in Buenos Aries . Dynamic duo: Sergio Aguero (R) and Lionel Messi pose for a selfie on their way to Brazil . Say cheese: Lionel Messi (3R) joins his Argentina teammates for a group selfie on the plane to Brazil . ‘Football is an integral part of  everyday life in Argentina. It is incredibly intense and you feel you have let people down when you come home without the trophy. ‘But we can do it this time. Most people back home expect a front three of Messi, Gonzalo Higuain and Sergio Aguero. What an attacking force that is but, for me, it would be just as potent if it was Ezequiel Lavezzi and Rodrigo Palacio alongside Messi. ‘It is about getting the balance right, and I firmly believe we have players who can be counted on to contribute all over the pitch.’","Javier Zanetti claims Lionel Messi will lift the World Cup in Brazil .

Hopefully that’s just the start and I think there is more to come. ‘If I stay fit I want to play for England as long as I can. I love it. It was all I wanted to do as a kid and I’ve been very lucky to have been able to do it for so long. You don’t want to give that shirt up.’ This landmark seemed a long way away when Bell was dropped at the start of the last new era after England had been bowled out for 51 in Jamaica early in 2009. ‘There were times when I doubted I would get this far,’ admitted Bell. Turning point: Ian Bell was dropped after England were humiliated by the West Indies in Jamaica, 2009 . Unfinished business: Ian Bell did not want to spend the rest of his career playing county cricket alone . ‘That West Indies tour was the turning point. When you get dropped you ask questions of yourself.’ The answers he came up with saw him become a much more resilient member of the England side when he regained his place during the Ashes later that year. ‘I started to score runs when the team really needed them and that’s what I needed to do,’ said Bell, now England’s unofficial vice-captain. ‘Maybe in my early days I took the easy option too often. I remember the guys walking out at Lord’s at the start of that 2009 summer while I was at Edgbaston and I just had this feeling that I didn’t want to just play county cricket. I had unfinished business and when I got my next chance with England I didn’t want to let it go.’ In from the cold: Ian Bell regained his place at the 2009 Ashes and has not looked back since . Revenge?: Ian Bell is bowled out by Shamida Eranga in the 1st Investec Test match at Lord's . Bell credited the late Neal Abberley at Warwickshire and sacked England batting coach Graham Gooch as the biggest influences on his career outside his family. ‘I wish Neal could be here on Friday with me,’ said Bell. ‘He was somebody who got me to where I am now and Goochie is probably as close as I’ve come to the relationship I had with Neal. They saw the game very similarly and gave me a lot of honest feedback. It will certainly be nice to share a beer with Graham at some point.’ Of the previous 11 England players to play 100 times only Graham Thorpe was in the winning side on his landmark Test, and even he never played in another after his 100th cap against Bangladesh. Bell hopes to buck the trend. ‘This week is exciting and it’s about winning rather than my 100th Test,’ he said. ‘I will look back on four winning Ashes series and winning in India when I finish but I still think there are more special things round the corner.’ Buck the trend? Graham Thorpe was the only man to win on his landmark 100th cap .","Ian Bell will become the 12th man to reach 100 caps for England .

"Tom Hanks made a New York cabbie's day by inviting him backstage to his Broadway show after the two bonded over his films and Ferraris. Proving himself every bit as warm-hearted as his roles onscreen, the actor was so grateful that a tired driver put off going home after his shift to make one last journey, the he gave him free tickets and a backstage pass as a reward. The cab driver - known as Mr Ferrari for his love of the clothes sporting the car company's logo - told how he picked up Hanks without knowing who he was, and bonded with him over a cheeky reference to one of his films. Scroll down for video . Unlikely friendship: A cab driver who goes by the name of Mr Ferrari, left, befriended Tom Hanks, right, when he picked him up in his cab - and was later rewarded with a visit backstage while he was starring in Mr Lucky . Selfie: Mr Ferrari is pictured above with Hanks straight after their cab ride . From then on, every time he picked up anyone in New York who knew Hanks, he forwarded a 'hello' - and was eventually rewarded with a follow-up invitation. The unlikely encounter, which took place on a journey through Manhattan, came after Hanks flagged down Mr Ferrari on Park Avenue and asked him for a ride to 74th St. He didn't recognize Hanks immediately - as he had his cap pulled low over his face - and said he wasn't going that way so couldn't take him. But he changed his mind shortly after and took him anyway. 'WIIILLLSSOOOON': The pair bonded after Mr Ferrari made a reference to Hanks's character in Castaway (left), who made an imaginary friend called Wilson (right) from a blood-smeared volleyball . He said: 'I think about it, and I start feeling bad for the guy, cause hey - I got a conscience. So I call him back to the cab and tell him to hop in', according to theHumans of New York blog. His act of kindness is eventually rewarded months later when another passenger who knows Hanks forwards an exclusive invitation to see Mr Lucky - Hank's Broadway debut - then meet him backstage afterwards. The two got along during the journey after Mr Ferrari made a reference to Hanks's character in the 2000 film Castaway, and Hanks took a liking to his driver's sportswear. Describing the encounter, the driver recalled: '...He gets in the car all excited, all animated, and he's talking about all these things. But he's got his cap pulled down way over his eyes, so I can't see who it is.' 'But pretty soon I start to recognize his voice. And when we get to a light, I turn to him, and I look him in the eye, and I scream: ""WIIIIIIILLLSSSSSOOOOOOON!!!"" And that really got him. He started laughing hard.' The two then reportedly struck up a friendship over the cabbie's penchant for Ferrari gear - he was wearing a cap and a shift at the time. At the end of the journey the two took a selfie together on the street. Mr Ferrari then said he found himself picking up people who knew or had worked with Hanks - and every time forwarded a greeting 'from Mr Ferrari'. Broadway debut: Hanks was starring in Lucky Guy at the time - between April and July 2013 . And when one acquaintance sent the greeting on via text message he finally got a reply - and the offer to meet again. The driver said: 'Then one day I’m driving, and I get a text from one of the people that I’d driven, and it says: ""Mr. Hanks wants to invite you to see his Broadway show."" 'So I bring my lady to the show, and we get to go backstage and everything, and after the show, we’re waiting for him in his dressing room, and he walks in and screams: ""Mr. Ferrari!""... The name of his show was Lucky Guy. How crazy is that? Cause that was me. A lucky guy!"" The cab driver does not reveal exactly when either the initial ride nor the visit backstage took place. But Lucky Guy's Broadway run lasted from April 1 2013 to July 3 the same year.

"Red Bull team principal Christian Horner is adamant Mercedes can still be caught in this year's Formula One world championship. Horner points out after six grands prix the dominance of Mercedes has left them just 18 points shy of a maximum score, with 240 from a potential 258. Five consecutive one-twos have propelled Mercedes into a 141-point lead over Red Bull in the constructors' championship going into Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix, a seemingly insurmountable hurdle even with 13 races remaining.

Belief: Horner is convinced all is not lost and Vettel (pictured) can put Mercedes under pressure . Horner, though, is convinced all is not lost and that a fifth world title is not beyond his team. When asked as to what fuelled his belief, Horner said: 'Just looking at what we've achieved over the past four years, the quality of the team we have. 'Nobody is giving up, nobody is chucking in the towel. 'Yeah, we've a mountain to climb, and take nothing away from Mercedes who have done an incredible job this year. 'But as we've seen in previous years, like in 2012 when we had a difficult start, we managed to turn that situation around and get ourselves back into that championship. 'The task here is certainly bigger than that, but nobody is giving up on anything. 'As we saw in Monaco (the last grand prix) we started to put them under a little bit of pressure.'

Horner, dismissing the idea that thoughts were already turning to next year, added: 'We're not choosing to look at it like that. 'Obviously Renault have to start thinking about next year because they have to again submit the elements they can change within their design. 'Of course, what they learn this year is absolutely relevant to next year. 'So our focus at the moment is very much on each race as it comes, developing the car as best we can and trying to reduce the gap. 'Renault fully understand the predicament they are in. Carlos Ghosn (CEO) was in Monte Carlo to look and see for himself. 'There are no ultimatums to Renault, other than we want to improve as quickly as we can. 'We've enjoyed a great deal of success with them over the years. All our race victories and world championships have been with Renault engines, and we trust in them to sort out their issues.' It is why Red Bull will not be jumping ship to another power unit supplier, as recent speculation has suggested. 'Not at this point in time,' asserted Horner.

"During a spacewalk on 7 October a ‘UFO’ was spotted hovering near the International Space Station (ISS), leading some to suggest Nasa had inadvertently revealed an alien spaceship in orbit. Sadly the answer is much more straightforward, with the smudge being either an speck of dust or a lens flare from the sun. That hasn’t stopped some conspiracy theories arising though, with  ufologists somewhat speculatively claiming it was proof that we are not alone in the universe. A ‘UFO’ appeared briefly (shown in red ring) in a Nasa video of a spacewalk on the ISS on 7 October. The sighting led to speculation that it might be an alien spacecraft. But experts have revealed it is just an artefact in the image such as lens flare. 'My guess is that it's an artefact of some sort,' says Professor Andrew Balogh . The not-so-alien object was spotted when Flight Engineers Reid Wiseman of Nasa and Alexander Gerst of Esa conducted a spacewalk outside the ISS to fix an electrical problem. In video shot by Nasa and uploaded to YouTube last week, the UFO can be seen hovering just for a few seconds behind the astronauts, before the camera cuts to another angle. Outlandish theories suggested it might be an alien spaceship joining the ISS in orbit. Of course these theories are very wide of the mark, clearly evidenced by the fact the object doesn't appear in other images - aside from more obvious reasons. Another theory suggested it might be a Dragon or Soyuz spacecraft, but as both of these were docked at the station at the time of the spacewalk this was not possible. As the object is not moving in the image another suggestion was that it was a piece of debris that fell off the ISS. But, again, as the object does not appear in other images this also seems unlikely. This leaves just one option, namely that it is an artefact in the lens of the camera taking the shot, likely just a bit of glare from the sun as the ISS continued its orbit around Earth. Nasa was yet to comment on the event when contacted by MailOnline. In images just before a point in the live feed the smudge is not visible, but then in the next moment it suddenly appears. Some observers were quick to label the object a ‘mysterious craft’ or some other sort of UFO. ‘The video showed astronauts spacewalking as they were working on a mission,’ says UFO Blogger. ‘Suddenly almost after 1:50 minutes, a mysterious craft appeared flying near the astronauts for a few seconds. ‘The shape and size of the UFO could not be defined clearly as the telecast was not much clear.’ But others were less than convinced. Professor Andrew Balogh from the Imperial College London Department of Physics tells MailOnline: 'Generally speaking UFO sightings are either explained by some artefact effect - even some space junk - or left unexplained as there is not enough evidence. The event took place on 7 October as two astronauts performed a spacewalk. American Reid Wiseman and German Alexander Gerst moved a refrigerator-sized pump (shown in the foreground of this image) that had been left outside the station since December 2013 . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425 kilometres). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000 kilograms) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600 kilometres) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,800 days, during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for over 13 years. ‘It's difficult to judge from the video in this instance, because of its poor quality. 'If Nasa has access to high quality images, they may investigate further. ‘It's difficult correctly to interpret the size of an object on a 2D projection. ‘However, while the ""object"" was visible, the ISS must have moved a considerable distance [but] there appears to be no change in the size. ‘So if it was indeed an object, it was travelling with the ISS. ‘My guess is that it's an artefact of some sort, not space debris, unless something suddenly detached from the ISS.’ But he adds it’s ‘unlikely to be an ""object"" - this sighting isn't enough to convince the sceptics.’ Space science writer Amy Teitel adds: 'I’d say it looks like a reflection inside the camera, a trick of light. 'It’s not moving at all so it’s unlikely to be floating hardware, but it looks like it could be the reflection of some hardware hitting the lens the right way to show up on the image and look like a UFO when really, it’s not physically there.' The ISS (shown) has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000 kilograms) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600 kilometres) per hour . Astronauts Wiseman and Gerst were working to relocate a failed cooling pump the size of a fridge and install a power cable device to provide backup electrical capability to the station. It was the station’s 182nd spacewalk (shown) in support of station assembly and maintenance, and the first for both Wiseman and Gerst. Meanwhile Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, says: 'In these latest images a faint elongated object appears and brightens. 'It is visible for a few seconds and it is not reportedly seen by the two astronauts carrying out repairs to the ISS. 'To sceptics it is caused by lens flare or light reflecting off a piece of debris; to ufologists this is convincing evidence that UFOs are taking a regular and active interest in the ISS. 'If it was a UFO it would have been nice if its alien occupants had stepped out and helped with the repairs.' Some have incorrectly speculated that it could be one of two spacecraft docked to the ISS - SpaceX’s Dragon or the Soyuz TMA-14M - but as both were docked at the time this isn’t possible. The fact that the ISS is quite clearly bathed in sunlight at the time - as the whole shot is in light -heavily suggests it is a bit of lens flare from the sun on the camera lens. The Examiner was slightly more speculative in its analysis of the incident though: ‘The October 7 incident cannot be video of either the Dragon X or Soyuz spacecraft which are docked. Nor does it appear to be caused by a lensflare/camera reflection. 'The elliptical shape of the object is consistent with earlier incidents at the ISS involving UFOs close by or even docking with the ISS. 'Is it possible that once again, a spacecraft of unknown origin has been captured on video visiting the ISS, this time monitoring a spacewalk by two astronauts?’ Seen here are the astronauts outside the ISS before the 'UFO' appeared. The fact that the ISS is quite clearly bathed in sunlight at the time - as the whole shot is in light -heavily suggests it is a bit of lens flare from the sun on the camera lens . Some might be disappointed that the real explanation, though, is slightly more mundane -  if the event in which live footage is broadcast from a football pitch-sized space station hurtling around Earth at 17,150mph (27,600 km/h) can be considered mundane. Astronauts Wiseman and Gerst were working to relocate a failed cooling pump the size of a fridge and install a power cable device to provide backup electrical capability to the station. It was the station’s 182nd spacewalk in support of station assembly and maintenance, and the first for both Wiseman and Gerst. A more recent spacewalk taking place today is shown in this frame grab image from a live Nasa feed showing Russian cosmonauts Maxim Suraev and Alexander Samokutyaev outside the ISS.  The astronauts are performing maintenance, among other tasks - but no 'UFOs' have emerged in the latest footage .","A ‘UFO’ appeared briefly in a Nasa video of a spacewalk on the ISS .

"England were condemned to a series defeat despite a stirring late fight-back, as the All Blacks ran riot after half-time at the Forsyth Barr Stadium to re-assert their global supremacy. Stuart Lancaster’s national team had taken a 10-0 lead early in this second Test and once again showed a commitment to attack the world champions with pace and ambition. But having led going into the break, the visitors were simply blown away after half-time, as New Zealand scored three tries in a devastating 22-minute spell to set up the victory which means they are 2-0 up in the series ahead of next Saturday’s final Test in Hamilton. This was the All Blacks’ 16th consecutive Test victory and if they are successful next weekend, they will equal the world record set by their predecessors in the Sixties and matched by South Africa in the 1997-98. Yet, this result also served as a reminder that the Kiwis will not be easily knocked from their perch at next year’s World Cup. Over and out: Julian Savea scores a try to increase New Zealand's lead against England . Catch me if you can: Ben Smith scored a try for New Zealand against England . There . was considerable English optimism going into this match, on the back of . their heartening performance at Eden Park in the first Test. But . ultimately, Lancaster’s side were given a stark illustration that their . quest to re-emerge as a global force remains a work in progress. When . the All Blacks really found their rhythm here, England simply couldn’t . stem the tide. Their defence unravelled and they lost all structure and . shape. Yet, a late rally . which brought tries for Mike Brown and Chris Ashton highlighted the . spirit in the squad and a refusal to succumb to a heavy defeat. The . efforts in the closing stages not only made the final scoreline mighty . close, it suggested that England still have it in them to seize a . consolation victory next weekend. After . all the local jibes about England’s stalling tactics, the visitors . delivered a stirring retort by storming into this match with high-tempo . endeavour. They were soon building pressure in the New Zealand half and . took the lead in the third minute with a penalty by Owen Farrell, before . surging clear moments later. In . the series opener seven days earlier, England had secured a 100 per . cent return from their lineout, but that record was spoiled in the sixth . minute here when the All Blacks stole a Rob Webber throw. Yet, their . poaching effort didn’t work out well. Aaron . Smith’s attempted clearance kick was charged down by Joe Launchbury, . the Wasps lock picked up on the left and sent an off-load in-field to . the charging Tom Wood. He in turn released Webber and the hooker drove . at the line, but was held up inches short and from a subsequent ruck, . the hosts stole possession and cleared to touch. Promise: England made an encouraging start when Marland Yarde scored an early try . Lacking: England were unable to build on the good start and capitalise on the early try though . Match-winners: Julian Savea and Ben Smith celebrate their convincing victory against England . Make sure: Ma'a Nonu added a third try to put the All Blacks well in control of the game . Regroup: England learnt a lot about themselves during the rollercoaster ride against New Zealand . No . matter. England claimed their next lineout and after a brief drive by . the pack, Danny Care picked out Marland Yarde on an inside line and the . wing crashed through Richie McCaw’s tackle and through Aaron Cruden, . before stetching to touch down. Farrell converted and Lancaster’s men . had roared into a 10-point lead in the space of eight minutes. Stung . into life, back came the All Blacks. Ben Smith broke past Luther . Burrell’s attempted tackle to ignite an attack and Ma’a Nonu twisted . past Joe Marler to keep the move alive, but England’s defence scrambled . well to hold out. Despite . the perfect conditions under the stadium roof, the kickers had their . lapses. First, Cruden missed a penalty shot and then Farrell was . off-target from long-range at the other end. From . that point, the game became disjointed and loose – fast and dramatic . but lacking real incision in the danger areas. England continued to work . the ball from side to side, but without making good use of their . powerful ball-carriers to generate momentum, they were unable to . generate sufficient momentum to further unlock the Kiwi defence. Just . before half-time, out of nowhere, the visitors should have scored a . second try. A sustained New Zealand raid faltered when Cory Jane knocked . on, Tuilagi picked up and roared away down the right, into enemy . territory. He made it as far as the home 22 before being hauled down by . Ben Smith, who managed to win the ball on the floor against Brown and . the danger was averted. There . was just enough time for the home side to earn another penalty, which . Cruden kicked to make it 10-6 to England at half-time. After the break, . it was as if a switch was flicked as the All Blacks went into over-drive . to seize the initiative. Running man: Billy Twelvetrees of England skips past Ma'a Nonu during the first-half . In the book: Owen Farrell, centre, is shown the yellow card by referee Jaco Peyper . In . the 43rd minute, England were on the charge but an off-load by Billy . Twelvetrees went loose and Brodie Retallick snatched the ball, which was . transferred across to the left. Cruden ran clear through a gap and . released Savea, who drew Brown and passed back inside for Ben Smith to . burst into space and around to the posts. Cruden . converted and after another Farrell penalty briefly levelled the . scores, the onslaught continued. Ben Smith took a high kick to instigate . another wave of Kiwi pressure and Aaron Smith darted away down the . blind side, before being stopped in his tracks by Farrell in the England . 22. It only delayed the inevitable though as a long pass left reached . Nonu, he off-loaded to Kaino and the No 8 sent Savea away to score in . the corner. A previously . balanced contest was turning into a mis-match as Conrad Smith broke into . the visitors’ 22 with men outside, but his pass flew into touch. But . there was no containing the world champions as Beauden Barrett kicked a . penalty after Farrell was sin-binned for killing the ball at a ruck as . England desperately tried to repel another assault. The . All Blacks then further capitalised on their numerical advantage with . another try. Cory Jane’s pass sent Conrad Smith into the 22 again and . when he picked out Nonu on the flank, the centre stepped inside and back . out to score in the corner. Barrett converted and the game was well and . truly up. Or so it seemed… . Once England were back up to their full 15-man strength, their pride and . defiance kicked in as they stormed forward in search of a try to revive . the contest. It duly came eight minutes from full-time when Billy . Twelvetrees released Brown and the full back touched down despite a . combined effort by Aaron Smith and Jane to hold the ball up. Farrell . converted and England weren’t finished. The last play of the match saw . Yarde and Wood open up space for Tuilagi on the right and he passed out . to Brown, who charged down the flank and sent the ball back inside for . Chris Ashton to go over unopposed. Farrell’s conversion ensured that the . All Black’s winning margin was a mere point. So near, but so far – once . again.

"CCTV cameras captured the moment Britain's most wanted drug baron met up with two other criminal kingpins to discuss a cocaine and heroin smuggling network which 'spanned the globe'. Kevin Hanley - described as the 'top, top man' in the drugs world - met up with Merseyside dealer Richard Harrison and Scottish 'fixer' Matthew Edward at a bar in Liverpool in November 2012. It was a meeting that would be the start of their downfall and all three are now behind bars after Kevin Hanley - along with his girlfriend Chrysi Minadaki and 'right-hand man' John Fowler - were jailed earlier this month following Harrison and Edward's conviction last November. CCTV shows the moment drug dealers Kevin Hanley, left, Matthew Edward, centre, and Kevin Harrison, right, along with Hanley's girlfriend Chrysi Minadaki, came together for a meeting that would lead to their later arrest . The trio and Minadaki - pictured getting into a cab after the meal - have since all been arrested and jailed . Two separate arms of the National Crime Agency (NCA) were on the tail of different members of the trio when they met up two years ago, but investigators at that point were not sure of their connections. An agent from the organisation has since described the meeting as a 'eureka moment' when it emerged the men's activities were linked and the full scale of their empire was revealed. Hanley had set up an international trafficking ring using a wholesale food business in London's Covent Garden market as a front for the transportation of Venezuelan cocaine by lorry from southern Europe to Britain, hiding £5million of cocaine inside watermelons and pomegranates. He started the enterprise after his former boss, Irish-born career-criminal Brian Brendon 'The Milkman' Wright, was jailed for 30 years. Hanley met up with Harrison, 58, and Edward, 49, at the Restaurant Bar and Grill in Liverpool in a moment described as a breakthrough by the NCA. Kevin Hanley (left) and Chrysi Minadaki (right) were jailed this month after they were tracked down in Greece . 'Fixer' Matthew Edward (left) and Hanley's 'right-hand man' John Fowler (right) are now also behind bars . Hanley, pictured with the pomegranates he used to smuggle heroin and cocaine into Britain from Europe . An NCA agent told the Liverpool Echo: 'Our surveillance brought us both independently to the bar in Liverpool and it was the first time we realised the link between the two parties. It was a eureka moment where the two investigations suddenly became one. 'They all thought they were untouchable but their coming together in Liverpool that day proved to be the catalyst to their downfall.' Harrison and Edward were later snared after British police tipped off Italian authorities to a shipment of 35kg of heroin concealed in breadsticks in a Scottish lorry later that month. Hanley, 52, and Minadaki, 45, went on the run in Greece for eight months but were eventually arrested while watching the British and Irish Lions play Australia in an Irish bar in the country in 2013. Harrison was also caught on CCTV meeting  Hanley at a Reading FC football match in late 2012 . Around £2 million in cash was found stuffed in suitcases when John Fowler's flat in Chelsea was raided . Investigators also found cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis worth almost £3 million at the property . Hanley and Minadaki were this month both jailed for 17 years at the Old Bailey in London for drugs supply offences. Mathew Edward, of Glasgow, was jailed for six years, 10 months in Glasgow last year and Richard Harrison, of Liverpool, was handed a five and a half year sentence. John Fowler, 58, who used his fruit and veg firm as a front for the drug smuggling enterprise was jailed for 16 years. Brendan Foreman, NCA regional head of investigations, said: 'For all the high end technology we used to narrow down the search for him, it was good old fashioned policing that led investigators to a bar in Greece, after they correctly predicted Hanley's love of rugby made him vulnerable and he would not be able to resist coming out of hiding to watch a crucial Lions match. 'The evidence against Hanley was overwhelming and his decision to plead guilty ultimately led to a significant prison sentence and the disruption of an international crime network that truly spanned the globe.' The men met at the upmarket 'Restaurant Bar and Grill' in Liverpool in 2012, not knowing two sections of the National Crime Agency were on their tails . The meeting has been described as a 'eureka moment' by an investigation insider, who says it confirmed the trio were in business together in a network that 'spanned the globe'","Trio of drug smugglers were being tailed by different arms of crime agency .

"This is the terrifying moment a team of Hazmat-wearing officials boarded a Boston plane following reports that five passengers were exhibiting flu-like symptoms.

"Michael Ballack believes that the current Germany squad is their best for 20 years, but that they need to win something in order to prove themselves at the highest level. Joachim Low's side are set to face Portugal in their World Cup opener on Monday and, according to The Times, Ballack has warned his fellow countrymen that 'being talented is not enough.'

Point to prove: But Joachim Low must lead them to victory for them to be considered a great side . Legend: Ballack scored 42 goals in 98 games for the national team . The closest they have come in recent times was in 2002, when a Ballack-inspired side made it all the way to the final, before falling 2-0 to Brazil - a game from which the midfielder was unfortunately suspended. But he believes that, despite some shortcomings, the current crop have what it takes to challenge in Brazil. 'From my point of view, this is the best group of players Germany have had for 20 years, better than any of the teams I played in, including the one who reached the 2002 World cup final.

"The chief executive and leading researcher of biotechnology company Phosphagenics conned millions of dollars from her employer over nine years to fund her lifestyle and support her sick daughter. Dr Esra Ogru, 39, of Wheelers Hill, Victoria, was part of a scam which saw $6 million embezzled from the world renowned biotech company between 2004 and 2013. Dr Ogru swindled Phosphagenics and its subsidiary Vital Health Sciences using fake invoices and credit card claims, the Victorian County Court heard on Thursday. Prosecutor Allan Sharp said about $3.8 million had already been reimbursed and about $5.2 million was expected to be recouped. Dr Ogru swindled Phosphagenics and its subsidiary Vital Health Sciences using fake invoices and credit card claims, Victorian County Court heard on Thursday . The CEO kept her crime secret from her co-chief executive, and pleaded guilty to seven counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception . The CEO kept her crime secret from her co-chief executive, and pleaded guilty to seven counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. David Grace QC, lawyer for Dr Ogru, said that a large proportion of the stolen money was used for lifestyle enhancement. Dr Ogru allegedly used the sum for purchasing jewellery, travel, and mortgage repayments, Mr Grace told the Victorian court. 'In some way she felt ... she deserved more in terms of remuneration and wanted a better lifestyle in a hurry,' he said. In May 2008, Dr Ogru gave birth to her daughter, who had a life-long condition which resulted from a missing gene. Mr Grace said that  this changed Dr Ogru's motivations for embezzling the money, and she began using it to pay for world-class health care for the girl. Prosecutor Allan Sharp said about $3.8 million had already been reimbursed and about $5.2 million was expected to be recouped . Grace told the court that Dr Ogru's daughter became the first human in the world to trial an experimental therapy in Germany, which had previously been used on animals . Mr Grace asked the court to take into consideration the exceptional circumstances during sentencing. The funds went towards renovations of the family home to accommodate for the girl's special needs, including a wheelchair. 'Prior (to May 2008) can be characterised as greed, (but) post, greed and need,' Mr Grace said. Mr Grace told the court that Dr Ogru's daughter became the first human in the world to trial an experimental therapy in Germany, which had previously been used on animals. The therapy had to be administered daily, adding that the treatment had led to the drug becoming an accepted prescription medicine around the world. The company suspended Dr Ogru in July 2013 after irregularities in financial records came to light, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Her lawyer admitted that had her co-executive known of her daughter's medical problems, she would have most likely received legal help. Judge Felicity Hampel extended her bail until sentencing on November 5.","Dr Esra Ogru embezzled nearly $6 million nine years .

"This black and white photograph, taken 75 years ago this week, captures the remarkable moment the first German plane was shot down over Britain during the Second World War. As the broken swastika-adorned aircraft lies beaten on a hill, crowds of Scottish villagers from Humbie, in East Lothian, gather to inspect the wreckage. The Luftwaffe Heinkel He111 was forced to crash land in Scotland following a tense dog fight in the skies - and was later dubbed the 'Humbie Heinkel'. Historic: The Luftwaffe Heinkel He111 pictured was the first plane to be shot down over British soil in the second World War - 75 years ago this week . The two surviving German crew surrendered to a local policeman, who was the first person to reach the scene, becoming prisoners of war. Flight lieutenant Archie McKellar, 25, seriously damaged the Heinkel with machine gun fire, and it crash landed near the small village 75 years ago this week. Hero: A drawing of pilot Archie McKellar who was killed hours after the end of the Battle of Britain . McKellar was killed a few hours after the official end of the Battle of Britain at the age of 28, and he became known as the 'Forgotten Ace'. William Simpson, author of the book Greatest Squadron of Them All, has argued that reserve pilots such as McKellar deserve more recognition. He says: 'So many people don't seem to realise this happened. This was significant. It was the first time that the Germans had attempted to attack anything within British airspace. 'They were trying to attack Royal Navy ships anchored in the east of the Forth Bridge and were intercepted by two squadrons flying Spitfires. 'These squadrons weren't regular air force flying the latest Spitfires, but auxiliaries or reservists. 'A lot of people think they don't get the credit they deserve. People have heard about the Battle of Britain, but these guys, who started the whole thing, are virtually unknown.' The crashed Heinkel was part of a Luftwaffe squadron which had been ordered to attack Royal Navy Vessels in the Firth of Forth on October 28, 1939. The RAF intercepted the Luftwaffe, sending Spitfires from 602 and 603 squadron, which resulted in a dog-fight over the fields of East Lothian in Scotland. The Heinkel He111 was often described as a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' as it masqueraded as a transport aircraft - though its actual purpose was to provide the Luftwaffe with a fast medium bomber .

"Parents are demanding that supermarket giant Asda withdraws two blood-stained Halloween costumes, claiming they make their children look like 'shot teenagers'. Pictures of the two outfits, designed for children as young as nine, show ripped American footballer and cheerleader uniforms splattered with fake blood. The cheerleader fancy dress, which can be bought with socks and pom poms has already sold out online in ages 9-10 and 11-12. Both costumes are also sold in stores. 'Bad taste': Parents have signed an online petition that urges Asda to withdraw their cheerleader and American football Halloween costumes. They claim the outfits, pictured, make their children look like 'shot teenagers' Mother Sheila Pinney, from Bristol, said that she was 'left speechless' when she saw the costumes at her local Asda while looking for something for her son. She said that the costumes, which cost between £8 and £14, are in 'incredibly bad taste, even for Halloween'. Mrs Pinney wrote a letter to CEO Andy Clarke requesting that the costumes be removed and has urged those outraged by the move to sign her online petition. So far the list, which is hosted by change.org, has more than 130 signatures. Writing on the website, Mrs Pinney said: 'I was actually left speechless when I saw the costumes, while seeking a suitable fancy dress costume for my 4-year old son. 'He asked me what the costumes were, as he is familiar with ghosts, skeletons and the usual Halloween imagery, and I actually couldn't form the words to explain what they were, as how can you tell a 4-year old that he is looking at costumes depicting ""shot teenagers""?' Gory: Sheila Pinney, who started the online petition, said she was left speechless when she saw the blood-stained costumes while shopping in Asda . According to the Asda website, the Halloween Cheerleader Fancy Dress Costume is 'sure to be a hit'. It claims: 'With scary detailing and pompoms, she’ll be set for all events this season'. While the Halloween American Footballer Fancy Dress Costume, which comes with shoulder padding and 'bone detailing' on the left leg, promises to 'scare everyone at those Halloween parties'. One person supporting the petition wrote: 'This is in the worst taste possible. Disgusting!' Another said: 'I don't want our children subjected to or involved with such grotesque costumes.' A spokesman for Asda said: 'We appreciate that it isn't for everyone but the majority of our customers love dressing up at Halloween, especially in spooky or gory costumes which inevitably can include fake blood.' Last year Asda and supermarket giant Tesco were forced to apologise and withdraw two Halloween costumes when they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. Asda dropped its 'mental patient fancy dress costume', and Tesco later withdrew its 'psycho ward' outfit. Both stores apologised for any offence caused and agreed to make donations to the mental health charity, Mind. The charity, which complained that such costumes 'fuel' stigma, received £25,000 from Asda. The £20 Asda outfit included ragged clothing, fake blood, a mask and a fake meat cleaver while Tesco's orange boiler suit came with a plastic jaw restraint and offered to 'complete the look' with a machete.","Parents claim the costumes make their children look like 'shot teenagers'

"Will Buckley is relishing the challenge of taking the next step in his football education under the watchful eye of Gus Poyet. The 24-year-old winger was belatedly handed a top-flight debut as a substitute by Sunderland's head coach in last weekend's opening day 2-2 draw at West Brom some seven months after the Uruguayan had hoped to be able to do so. Poyet was unable to prise Buckley away from former club Brighton in January, where he had helped the midfielder to make the transition from League Two to the Sky Bet Championship,but launched a successful £2.5million bid earlier this month. Buckled in: Will Buckley is looking forward to facing Manchester United and improving under Gus Poyet . On Sunday, Buckley will hope to test himself against Manchester United at the Stadium of Light confident that Poyet can help him to fulfil his dreams. He said: 'Obviously, everyone knows what he did as a player but I have worked under him now for over two years and his passion just comes across to the players in a good way. 'He just gets the best out of me. Hopefully he improves players, that's one of his qualities, and hopefully I can carry on improving now I have joined here as well.' Here for the long haul: Buckley was signed for £2.5 million this summer after an unsuccessful bid in January . Buckley's rise has been steady, but impressive - he was playing his football with Rochdale in League Two when Watford handed him the chance to experience life in the Championship in January 2010. By his own admission, the progression was not straightforward, but he adapted to such an extent that within 18 months, Brighton were prepared to invest £1million in his services. He said: 'When I went from League Two to the Championship, for the first couple of months, I actually struggled, then I saw myself improving day to day. Hopefully that can be the same with the Premier League.' Re-united: Will Buckley played under Gus Poyet at Brighton and is confident he will get the best out of him . Buckley had 17 minutes as an emergency right-back at the Hawthorns to assess just how much he has to learn as he makes his latest step forward, but one difference between the Premier League and the Championship was immediately apparent. He said: 'They let you have the ball a little bit more comfortably, but when it gets to that final third, it's going to be more difficult to create goals and score goals, which everyone wants to do.' Poyet has few doubts Buckley, who followed former Brighton team-mate Liam Bridcutt to the Stadium of Light, will rise to the challenge as he looks to inject pace and flair into his team. The South American tended to play with a lone striker last season with the likes of Adam Johnson and Fabio Borini - the Italian remains tantalisingly out of the club's grasp as the close of the transfer window looms - providing support. A similar role would hold no fears for Buckley, who admits his instinct is to attack. He said: 'Growing up, I was always a striker but when I first broke on to the professional scene, I started playing as a winger and that's probably my best position now. 'I can play up front, but as a winger is probably where Gus has bought me to play. 'With the three he plays up there, it's interchanging and you get to play all along the front three, so I am comfortable playing in any one of those positions.'","Will Buckley was handed his Sunderland debut against West Brom .

"Stuart Broad sank to his knees at the end of five hard days of Test cricket, barely able to believe that he could not penetrate the defences of Nuwan Pradeep and take England to what would have been an extraordinary Lord’s victory. Sri Lanka’s last man, who had comically fallen on to his own wicket in the first innings, had somehow kept out the last five balls of the match to keep Broad and England at bay and earn his side the most hard fought and dramatic of draws. Pradeep, with a Test average of five, had been given out when the penultimate ball thudded into his pads to cue wild English celebrations but Paul Reiffel’s decision was overturned when the review made it painfully clear that ball had struck bat before pad. England’s ecstasy soon turned to agony at 6.45pm on the final day but when the dust settles on this first Investec Test they will surely acknowledge that Sri Lanka deserved to hang on after playing a full part in what became a wonderful advertisement for the ultimate form of the game.

Getting settled: England couldn't remove first innings centurion Sangakarra in the first session . Personal milestone: Sangakkara acknowledges the crowd as he reaches his 50 . Suddenly, out of nowhere, England were in . sight of victory. Yet such was Sri Lanka’s defiance through Prasanna . Jaywardene, who batted with a broken finger, and captain Angelo Mathews . that two wickets were still needed from that last over, Cook going back . from the wicketless Liam Plunkett to his big gun in Broad. It . was Broad who almost  completed a thrilling win, Pradeep taking . advantage of his reprieve by edging the final delivery just in front of . Jordan at second slip. Both he and Sri Lanka survived in tact ahead of . Friday’s second Test. It . would be simplistic to say England would have won had they declared on . Sunday because, with their own wickets falling regularly on the fourth . day, they were never really in a position to do so. Another start: Sri Lanka's Kaushal Silva (right) passed the half century mark for the second time this match . Going up: Gary Ballance, Jordan,Cook and Ian Bell appeal for the wicket of Karunaratne . Scratchy: Despite some shaky moments, Silva backed up his first innings 63 with 57 in his second dig . Gone: Chris Jordan claims the wicket of Silva with Prior claiming his first catch of the day after it was reviewed . Only . when Gary Ballance had averted the possibility of an  England defeat . and launched a counter-attack which saw 59 runs come off the last seven . overs of the fourth day could Cook be  satisfied that he had enough runs . to guarantee against defeat. Both . the timing of his declaration and his tactics on the final day, which . saw attacking and unusual field placings, could not be faulted. In . the end it was Mick Hunt’s pitch that just about had the final say and . both teams will be satisfied with their efforts as they head to . Headingley to do it all again in three days time. The game was drawn and . the England captain should not be hung and quartered by his critics . because of that. Captain's knock: Angelo Mathews dug in on day five as England pushed to claim 10 wickets . On watch: Alastair Cook's captaincy came under intense scrutiny after he declared before the start of play .

There was a wheelie bin flying past and down the street, about ten feet up in the air. 'There were roof tiles crashing down into the street and landing on cars and debris flying everywhere. 'It felt like a tornado. The whole thing can't have lasted more than two minutes before everything went dead quiet.

Hordes of riders from the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt gathered for the opening meet at Worcester Lodge, Gloucestershire . After the hottest Halloween in history, the autumn downpours arrived yesterday – and will vanish in time for a cool Bonfire Night. After sunshine and showers today and Tuesday, Bonfire Night will be the ‘best day of the week’, forecasters said. The Meteorological Office predicts dry weather with some sunny spells and – most importantly – a clear night across the UK on Wednesday. It follows the weekend’s heavy rain, which arrived just as many of the veteran cars in the London to Brighton car rally had stuttered to a halt. The band of heavy showers which moved across Britain even produced a mini tornado, hitting the Leicestershire town of Coalville at 7.20am yesterday. Part of the roof at the Belvoir Shopping Centre could be seen ripped off while there was damage to houses, cars and fences. Meanwhile, a search continued for the skipper and crew of a fishing trawler which went missing off the north-east coast. The vessel was last heard from about 100 miles east of the Farne Islands. An RAF helicopter winched three people to safety yesterday afternoon, one of whom died last night. Two more trawlermen are missing. The Zetland Hunt paraded through the rural lanes surrounding Headlam village in County Durham yesterday .

Riders from the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt also met for the opening meet  at Worcester Lodge near Badminton in Gloucestershire yesterday. This November will mark the 10th anniversary of the passing of the Hunting Act which banned fox hunting with dogs in February 2005. The hunts take advantage of loopholes in the law to continue the sport. Hunting with birds of prey is the most popular way of getting around legislation. The other is the 'accident' - when hounds attack foxes during a perfectly legal rabbit chase, despite the rider's best efforts to call them off.","Just two days after hottest Halloween on record at 24C, UK hit by showers, plummeting temperatures and tornado .

"Bras, girdles and leggings infused with caffeine are not effective weight loss aids, the FDC said on Monday. The companies that sold them have agreed to refund money to customers and pull their ads. The Federal Trade Commission said Wacoal America and Norm Thompson Outfitters were accused of deceptive advertising that claimed their caffeine-impregnated clothing would cause the wearer to lose weight and have less cellulite. Scroll down for video . Empty buzz: Caffeine-infused items such as Wacoal's Ipant Anti Cellulite Long Leg Shaper (pictured) do not lead to weight loss, said the FTC . 'If someone says you can lose weight by wearing the clothes they are selling, steer clear,' said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. 'The best approach is tried and true: diet and exercise,' she added. In the case of Oregon-based Norm Thompson, the company sold clothing made with Lytess brand fabric infused with caffeine which, the company said, would break down fat. 'Slimming and firming results are visible in under a month,' the company said in one advertisement the commission quoted in its complaint. Wacoal America, based in New Jersey, also advertised that its clothing had microcapsules with caffeine, vitamin E and other chemicals that it said led to weight loss. In one ad, it cited the 'revolutionary iPant new shapewear that works with your body to eliminate cellulite,' the FTC said. In both cases, the companies did not have evidence to back up their claims that the clothing would lead to substantial weight loss, the FTC said in the complaints. Neither company immediately responded to attempts to reach them for comment. Refunds will be about $1.5 million, the FTC said.",Wacoal America and Norm Thompson Outfitters have been accused of deceptive advertising .
"A clinically insane man, who killed his mother by slitting her throat, is missing and police believe he may be headed back to his old family home. Samuel Mark Walsh, also know as Enoch Samuel Wright hasn't been seen since Sunday when he failed to return from an authorised leave of absence at Perth's psychiatric facility Romily house in Claremont. In March 2007, the 38 year old was found not guilty of murdering his mother, Patricia Lynette Wright, at her Kalgoorlie home during a psychotic episode in 2005. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Samuel Mark Walsh failed to return from a leave of absence from Perth's psychiatric facility, Romily house (pictured) in Claremont . The court heard Walsh hit his mother with a sword, before he slit her throat with a bread knife and buried her in the backyard with his dog. Perth Now reported, Supreme court justice Geoffrey Miller ruled Walsh was a chronically paranoid schizophrenic and was not criminally responsible for his actions because he was insane. He was sentenced to be detained in a high security psychiatric unit, until January 2008 when he was recommended for release by way of leave of absence. It's not until now that Walsh has failed to return from a leave of absence. Police are monitoring his hometown of Kalgoorlie as well as the family home where Walsh killed his mother, with the owner removed for his safety. It's believed he was last seen in Merredin, heading to the Goldfields. 'It's upsetting considering a lot of us in this street have children that play out the front and I would have expected someone to come and knocked on my door on Sunday and told me that something had happened,' a resident told Nine News.

'Whatever the circumstances in this way, and I think the government and premier needs to come out and explain.' WA attorney general Michael Mischin said it's not known why Walsh failed to return, saying he had been compliant with the conditions of his leave in the past. 'Walsh's disappearance had been deal with in a timely and appropriate manner and he would seek a report on the incident once Walsh had been returned to detention,' he told Perth Now.

A 19-month-old baby boy died after he crawled from the back seat of the car and got his head trapped in the window as it closed. Robert Lynch from Zwolle, Louisiana, was sitting in the vehicle without a seatbelt on as his mother said they were 'only driving a short distance'.

"Steven Gerrard is refusing to get carried away when it comes to the importance of England's World Cup clash with Uruguay, but the Three Lions skipper insists Roy Hodgson's squad believe they will beat Luis Suarez and Co in Sao Paulo on Thursday. England are in desperate need of a win after falling to defeat Italy in their opening game and Gerrard is confident that his team-mates will come away from their second game with a positive result to show for their efforts. Speaking after training at the Arena Corinthians, Gerrard said: 'It’s not a final. I know Uruguay have said they’ll treat it like a World Cup final. We’ll treat it with importance but it’s not a cup final. VIDEO Scroll down to watch England arrive in Sao Paulo and Gerrard score in training .

On the mend: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain trains without a brace after injuring his knee in a friendly with Ecuador . Finding his feet: Oxlade-Chamberlain tests out his control as he bids to make his return to action . 'For me the key is who defends the best. We’re two very good attacking teams. We’re very confident we can get the right result. 'The . mood is very positive. We were disappointed with the result (against . Italy) but took positives. We need to forget the Italy result. We can’t . control that now. 'I think you will see another good attacking performance. That’s why I think the defending will be the key.' This will almost certainly be Gerrard's last World Cup and the thought of going home prematurely is something which does not sit well with Hodgson's captain. He added: 'I’ve spoken to the group in the week to reiterate the message about the pain of going out at the World Cup. It’s something we don’t want. We want to be here for as long as possible. We’ve all aware how difficult it will be if we don’t perform tomorrow.'

Decision time: Hodgson chats with Oxlade-Chamberlain during training in Sao Paulo . A defeat to Uruguay, coupled with a draw between Italy and Costa Rica on Friday, would mean an early exit for Gerrard and Co, but the Liverpool midfielder is focused and full of belief heading into Thursday's crucial clash with Oscar Tabarez's side. 'It’s very difficult to forget about the game. It’s a big game. I’ll be on my iPad studying on the opposition. I’m not feeling the game. I’m in confident mood. I’ve got faith in my team-mates,' said Gerrard. One player Gerrard is backing to continue his rapid rise is Raheem Sterling. The 19-year-old was England's standout player against the Azzurri and he looks set to start again in Sao Paulo. On his Reds team-mate, Gerrard said: 'At the risk of putting more pressure on a young player, everyone can see his potential. He’s had a fantastic season for Liverpool. He was consistent. 'I’m sure he’s going to be around at this level for a very long time. He’s got great pace. My prediction is that he’ll get many, many caps and be a big player for England.'

However, despite his close relationship with the Uruguay striker, Gerrard insists he will not contact him on game day. 'I’m not going to speak to him before the . game. That would be disrespectful to my team-mates. We’ve had conversations in . the build-up to this game but there will be no conversation tomorrow,' said Gerrard. Suarez is set to return after missing the opening game against Costa Rica while he recovered from knee surgery but, while Gerrard respects his Anfield colleague's talent, he insists the Premier League's leading scorer shouldn't be treated any differently. 'Luis Suarez is a genius, I’ve said it many times. It . will be a boost for Uruguay and their supporters to have him back but they’re more . than one player. They’re a good team.

"While America was watching the midterm election results come in, commentators on CNN were doing a terrible job pretending to be big fans of the Microsoft Surface Pro 3. Microsoft gave commentators on the network tablets to use throughout the night, but some of the reporters were seen blatantly typing away on their Mac products half concealed by their provided PC gadget. According to a source who was at the CNN studios for yesterday's coverage, the whole team wasn't exactly excited at the prospect of having to use Microsoft devices. Jake Tapper is a Mac: CNN's Chief Washington Correspondent was seen typing away on his iPad during election night coverage, behind a  Microsoft-provided Surface Pro 3 . Can you spot the iPad? Political contributor Ana Navarro used a Surface Pro to indiscreetly hold up her iPad during Tuesday night's election coverage . 'There's going to be no personal digital devices allowed on set today or tonight,' a CNN producer told guests and their handlers gathered in the network's Washington, D.C. 'green room' during a 5:00 p.m. broadcast. Apparently that rule wasn't followed by everyone. Camera angles exposed CNN's chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper as a Mac user, indiscreetly typing on his iPad from behind his free Surface Pro, while political contributor Ana Navarro used her tablet as a stand for her Apple device. 'They're just not allowing anybody to bring their own. Sorry about that.' The producer said she herself was an Apple devotee. 'I had Macs for ages and then had to switch to PCs,' she explained. 'Now I’m back to iPads and Macs again, and I just love it.' A press flack for former Republican Speaker of the House News Gingrich piped up from a chair. 'Newt's not gonna like this,' he said. 'It's gonna take his email forever to load on that thing. This ought to be interesting.' As Gingrich walked down a hallway toward CNN's broadcast studio, he was seen fiddling with an iPhone. A representative for CNN said that the Microsoft tablets used on election night coverage were 'not a product placement deal' and that reporters were not barred from bringing their own devices. 'Surface tablets were provided at each seat to give guests, contributors, and CNN talent real-time election results through ""My Magic Wall"" - an application optimized for Internet Explorer. 'While panelists rotated throughout the night, the tablets remained in place. Talent brought with them to the studio their own personal devices for email and social media,' the spokesman said. When Microsoft first launched their tablet, they ran a series of ads showing all of the things the Surface Pro could do (like stand up with a kickstand)  that an iPad couldn't. But it appears they are now focusing their efforts on attacking Apple's sales of the Macbook Air - their slimmest and lightest laptop, with a new commercial advertising campaign. This latest failure to market Microsoft's tablet comes after the company struck a $400million deal to supply the NFL with their tablets.","Microsoft provided their Surface Pro 3 tablets to CNN to use during election night coverage .

"Want to own a piece of a national tragedy? All you need is $20. September 11 survivors and victims' families are outraged over a gift shop attached to the new 9/11 museum in Lower Manhattan. The store associated with the National September 11 Memorial & Museum sells items ranging from key chains to NYPD dog vests marketed off the tragedy. Enraged: Families of 9/11 victims are outraged that a gift shop has been attached to the new Lower Manhattan museum . For sale: The new museum's gift shop sells t-shirts, stuffed animals, key chains and other products marketed off the tragedy . Jewelry, mousepads, magnets, flags, pins, stuffed animals, cellphone cases, toy firetrucks and much more are available for purchase. According to the museum's website, the proceeds benefit 'developing and sustaining' the memorial which is run by executives with privately-funded six-figure salaries. The idea of a gift shop alone is offensive to many, but is made even more painful considering 8,000 unidentified remains of victims were recently moved to a tomb beneath the museum. 'Here is essentially our tomb of the unknown. To sell baubles I find quite shocking and repugnant,' Diane Horning, who lost her  26-year-old son Matthew in the attacks, told the New York Post. Insensitive: Diane Horning, pictured above with Representative Chuck Schumer, lost her 26-year-old son Matthew in the Twin Towers attacks.

Matthew worked as a database administrator for Marsh & McLennan, an insurance firm which had offices in the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Matthew's remains were never recovered. 'I think it's a money-making venture to support inflated salaries, and they're willing to do it over my son's dead body,' Mrs Horning said. Joe Daniels, the memorial and museum's CEO, makes $378,000 a year, though his and other executives' six-figure salaries are funded through private donations. Still, the idea of a gift shop doesn't sit well with many close to the tragedy, who believe it could have been kept closed until Wednesday, when the museum opens to the public. President Obama dedicated the museum in a moving speech on Thursday, and the memorial has since only been open to survivors and victims' families. 'These people are suffering, and they don't need to be reaching into their pockets,' John Feal, a former Ground Zero demolition survivor, told the Post. 'The museum could have gone six days without asking for money.' However, Feal, who runs the FealGood Foundation for ailing 9/11 workers, says he understands the museum's need to sell items in order to cover costs. The museum plans to operate on a $63million budget with money raised through admission fees and donations. 'All net proceeds from our sales are dedicated to developing and sustaining the national September 11 Memorial & Museum,' the museum's website reads. 'Thank you for helping to build a lasting place for remembrance, reflection, and learning for years to come.' The gift shop itself was funded with a $5million donation from Paul Napoli and Marc Bern, partners in a law firm which made $200,0000 representing 10,000 Ground Zero workers in a lawsuit. That's $5million Feal believes should have been donated to the 'sick and suffering - their former clients'. Never forget: President Obama dedicated the new museum on Thursday, opening the memorial to survivors and victims' families.

"The trusty mascot of a basketball team seems to have upstaged the players during a match at the weekend - proving that maybe the team needs him on their side. The Sydney Kings' Lion launched himself into unprecedented territory when he took the weekly half-time shot during the first game of the season against the Wollongong Hawks at the weekend. According to Pedestrian TV, this is the third time in twenty years the no-look half-court basket has been sunk by the Kings' mascot. Scroll down for video . The Sydney Lion's mascot sunk the no-look half-court basket during half-time at the weekend . The aim of the exercise is to shoot a hoop by launching the ball backwards over one's head without looking, and the Lion did just that. Footage shows the furry mascot prepping himself for the throw by dribbling the ball on the ground in front of him. When he's ready the Sydney Kings Lion throws the ball towards the hoop behind him and quickly spins around to see if he was successful.

"Smart lighting and alarms aren’t new, but one firm is hoping to combine the two to provide the ultimate in home security. And it could spell the end of having to hunt for torches or candles during power cuts. BeOn bulbs learn your habits and replicates them when you’re on holiday, it stores energy in reserve, and it responds to doorbells and smoke alarms. They’re not cheap - prices start at $199 (£124) for three - but they are seen as an alternative to installed security systems. Scroll down for video . Sensors in the BeOn bulb learn a homeowner’s lighting habits and can replicate them when the user is on holiday, to give the illusion they are home. Bulbs can be set to switch on and off when they hear the sound of a doorbell, or they can link to a smoke alarm to warn homeowners in the middle of the night . The Massachusetts-based firm is seeking $100,000 (£62,800) funding on Kickstarter, and has achieved more than $39,800 (£24,900) at the time of writing. Sensors in the BeOn bulb learns a homeowner’s lighting habits and can replicate them when the user is on holiday, to give the illusion they are home. The bulbs can be set to switch on and off when they hear the sound of a doorbell, or smoke alarm, to alert homeowners in the middle of the night, or if they’re TV is up too loud. A radical new sensor could detect Ebola in blood samples within 30 minutes. Experts say the shoebox-sized light can be operated by anyone, and could be shipped to Africa to help monitor the spread of disease. It detects pathogens by shining light from multicolor LED sources on viral nanoparticles bound to the sensor surface by a coating of virus-specific antibodies. Interference of light reflected from the surface is modified by the presence of the particles, producing a distinct signal that reveals the size and shape of each particle. The sensor surface is very large and can capture the telltale responses of up to a million nanoparticles. Alternatively, if a burglar rings the bell to see if anyone is home, the lights turn on automatically to scare them off. The bulbs store a reserve of energy, in case of a power cut, and will gradually fade on and off to avoid being blinded first thing in the morning, for example. Homeowners can additionally control the lights using a smartphone app, and the energy-saving bulbs use soft white LEDs with a brightness of 800 lumens. This is the equivalent to a 60 watt incandescent bulb. A pack of three bulbs can be pre-ordered from the campaign for $199 (£124), six units can be bought for $395 (£247) and a nine-pack is $595 (£372). Prices vary for different connectors, including standard and recessed. ‘BeON Burglar Deterrent learns how you use your lights and then intelligently replays your lighting patterns while you are away to create the impression of a lived-in home,’ explained the firm.

"This is the moment CCTV cameras caught a heroin addict just before he attacked three women with a claw hammer in a hotel room and then left with a large suitcase of stolen goods. Cameras tracked Philip Spence's journey to the Cumberland hotel in London and his escape after the attack. Spence, 32, admits grievous bodily harm against the three women in the early hours of April 6 but denies attempted murder. Dressed in a t-shirt with a distinctive logo on the front, a dark blazer and a brown leather jacket, he concealed the hammer in his clothing. He entered the hotel at around 1.09am and can be seen striding through the spacious white lobby moments before launching his savage attack. At 1.36am, he walks back out of the hotel through the lobby with a dark brown suitcase in his hand and turns left to go to Marble Arch. The court was shown CCTV of Philip Spence in the entrance area at the Cumberland Hotel at 1.13am on April 6 . CCTV shows Philip Spence with a suitcase on the upper deck of a route N16 bus, at 1.38am on April 6 . Spence ditched the hammer out of a seventh floor fire escape window, jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard. Philip Spence admits grievous bodily harm but denies attempted murder . Two minutes later, Spence is seen running towards the N16 night bus to Victoria, breathing heavily and boarding. The footage showed him climbing the stairs to the empty upper deck and sitting on the back row with a large suitcase before travelling to co-defendant Thomas Efremi's flat in north London. He is seen getting off a second bus almost an hour after he is seen exiting the Cumberland Hotel. Spence then walked to Efremi's flat and within minutes Efremi, 57, left his flat in possession of the stolen bank cards and withdrew £5000 in cash. Khulood Al Najjar, 36, and her sisters Ohoud, 34, and Fatima, 31, from the United Arab Emirates, suffered fractured skulls and life-threatening injuries in the 'vicious and sustained attack' at the four-star hotel. Southwark Crown Court heard that when he was arrested on April 10, Spence told police: 'There ain't no blood on the hammer. I licked it all off, it went down my throat, yeah.' He was also said to have asked officers: 'Why so many of you involved? Are the Arabs paying you to catch me?' Efremi is later seen on CCTV shopping at various locations including the Vodafone store in Angel, north London. The court heard that following the attack Spence made several visits to Emma Moss, whose brother James, of Stroud Green in north London, has admitted handling stolen goods in relation to the case. A CCTV still of Thomas Efremi paying cash for his purchase at a Vodafone Store in Islington, London, on April 8 . The court heard Spence told police there was 'no blood on the hammer. I licked it all off, it went down my throat' The 33-year-old pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods last week after police found a significant amount of the stolen property in his home. A stash of the victims' property was found hidden in Moss's cellar and the stolen brown suitcase was discovered in an Amazon cardboard box. Officers found a prayer mat, a Gucci bag and some gold earrings belonging to 19-year-old Sheika Al-Mheiri. There was also a Chanel compact, sunglasses, a camera, five mobile phones and three iPads concealed in a TopShop bag. But valuables worth thousands of pounds were never recovered including two gold rings and two gold bracelets, one by designer Louis Vuitton, which were never found. James Moss, left, pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods last week and Thomas Efremi, 57, denies conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary . A Louis Vuitton necklace and gold earrings and a rose gold solitaire diamond ring have not been seen again. Black Gucci sunglasses, cash and bank cards were also among the items which were not recovered after the attack. In a police statement read out in court, Ms Moss said: 'I have known Philip Spence since I was 10 years old. My family and his family are long-time friends. 'I have never been in a relationship with Philip and we have no sort of relationship because of his drug addiction. I believe he uses crack cocaine and heroin. 'He doesn't have a home and stays with different people. The last address he was at was in south-east London. 'I know Philip to be a criminal who commits burglaries and robberies and he has told me he has stolen from hotels before. 'He is also someone who exaggerates and tells lies.' The court heard that on the evening of April 6, Spence turned up at Ms Moss's home. Kahlood al-Najar told Southwark Crown Court that she was woken to the sound of Spence shouting 'give me the f****** money' before he hit her over the head 'around 30 times' Spence burst in on three wealthy Arab sisters sleeping at the Cumberland Hotel off London's Oxford Street . In her statement to police, she said: 'He was hyperactive and told me about getting £50,000 worth of jewellery, BlackBerrys, iPods, bags and perfume. 'He told me he got them from a hotel room. I knew he had done something bad but he often tells tales.' Ms Moss said Spence was on crack but that she thought nothing more of what he had told her. The following day he returned and appeared to be 'paranoid', telling Ms Moss that his friends were trying to set him up and he was in 'big trouble'. She said Spence told her what had happened with the hammer, adding: 'Philip always carries a hammer with him. 'Philip told me that he had left the hammer there (at the hotel). He was crying but I believe this was about himself, not the women.' The court also heard Spence has a history of violence including an attempted hammer attack on his landlord. Simon Mayo QC, for the prosecution, told a jury of seven women and five men that Spence had been convicted twice for ABH, twice for affray, five times for burglary and once for theft, amongst other offences. The violence included attacks on a female council office worker, care home staff and passers-by on the street, and Spence also threatened to kill a man he met on an online dating site. Explaining the previous incident with a hammer, Mr Mayo said: 'On November 13 2007, Spence threatened his landlord at Forest Road in Walthamstow regarding rent. 'Spence became abusive and took a hammer from his landlord's handyman bag and chased the victim. 'He then used the hammer to attack the door to get at the victim, smashing a glass panel. 'Spence left the building briefly before returning to attack the door a second time.' Spence had also threatened to kill a man he had met through an online dating site before committing burglary at the victim's house, the court heard. Inside: The spacious white lobby of the Cumberland Hotel near Marble Arch Underground station in London (file) Four-star hotel: One of the luxury rooms inside the Cumberland Hotel in central London (file) Mr Mayo told the court: 'Spence was in contact with a Mr Pasquarelli through an online dating site. When Mr Pasquarelli refused to meet him, Spence telephoned him and became abusive. 'On one occasion, overheard by police, Spence telephoned him and became abusive, threatening to kill the victim by stabbing him. 'Spence also admitted breaking into the victim's house in Peckham Grove.' He was sentenced over the matter in September 2010 for sending a menacing message and burglary. In April 2007 the defendant was sentenced for punching a female employee unconscious at Islington Borough Council offices in north London, the court heard. Mr Mayo said: 'He was complaining about problems with his accommodation and shouted 'You will deal with this now' at a female member of staff. 'He punched her in the face, causing her to lose conciousness. She woke with serious head pain and later attended A&E.' Spence was also said to have become violent towards staff at a care home for homeless people where he was staying. He was sentenced in June 2011 for throwing a glass of water at one employee at the home before threatening staff that he would 'f*** (them) up'. And in April 2011, he was convicted for kicking a box at a man before spitting at him, punching him and biting his life shoulder whilst walking along Conway Road in north London. Spence, from north-west London, is also standing trial for conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary alongside Thomas Efremi, 57, from Islington in north London. While he was being held at Islington police station, Spence told officers: 'You know the only person you should be holding is Tom.' Efremi, who denies the conspiracy charge but has admitted one count of fraud in relation to the case, shook his head in the dock as the statement was read out and looked away from Spence, who stared straight ahead.

"The San Franciso Giants have made it into their third World Series in five years after a 6-3 victory in Game 5 against the St. Louis Cardinals - giving them a 4-1 win in the NL Championship Series. Travis Ishikawa hit a three-run walk-off into right field, ending the game at AT&T Park. They will now face Kansas City, unbeaten in the postseason, in an all-wild card series starting  onTuesday. Pablo Sandoval singled to start the ninth inning against Michael Wacha, making his first appearance of the postseason for the Cardinals. After an out, Brandon Belt walked to bring up Ishikawa, who drove a 2-0 pitch into the elevated seats in right field to set off an orange towel-waving frenzied celebration. Winning strike: Travis Ishikawa hit the first homer to end an NL Championship Series, a three-run shot that gave the San Francisco Giants a 6-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 . Going, gone: He watches as the ball soars into the elevated seats in right field during the three-run walk-off at AT&T Park - taking the Giants through to a World Series against the Kansas City Royals . Home straight: As he heads towards home plate, his team gather round as the umpire tries to keep them aside . It was the first time a homer sent the Giants into the World Series since perhaps the most famous drive in baseball history - Bobby Thomson's 'Shot Heard `Round the World' in a 1951 playoff. 'These guys have been through it,' Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. 'They have been battle-tested and they know how to handle themselves on this type of stage, and then add to that the kids that we brought up, and then Ishikawa. I mean, what a great story.' Ishikawa knew right away on his first career postseason homer, raising his right arm into the air as he watched his ball sail into the seats. He emphatically threw his helmet down to the dirt in triumph and joined his jubilant teammates at home plate as fireworks shot off from the center field scoreboard. Pinch-hitter Michael Morse homered leading off the eighth against Pat Neshek, who replaced Adam Wainwright to start the inning, to tie it 3-all. Morse was batting for Madison Bumgarner, who was named NLCS MVP. After taking a 3-1 lead in the series wild throws the past two days, the Giants used the long ball to advance to their third Series in five years by knocking out the defending NL champions. Reaction: He emphatically threw his helmet down to the dirt in triumph and joined his jubilant teammates at home plate as fireworks shot off from the center field scoreboard . Jubilation: The board behind them confirmed that they were the National League Champions and they were heading to the World Series . Tunnel: Ishikawa is held onto by teammates as he completes the three-run walk-off, ending the game . Celebrations begin: As he heads home, he is swarmed by his teammates running out of the dugout . Pile on: His teammates got to the ground and hugged him following his first postseason home run . Rookie Joe Panik hit a two-run drive in the third inning off Wainwright for the Giants first homer in seven games. 'Just a gutty effort through all this and I couldn't be prouder of these guys. They just don't stop fighting,' Bochy said. Ishikawa was Pittsburgh's opening-day first baseman, but was soon cut. He re-signed with the Giants, his original team, and went to the minor leagues before making it back to the majors. Ishikawa took a winding journey to his winning home run, too. Earlier in the game, he misplayed a flyball to left field that cost his team a run. He more than made up for it with his final swing. Bumgarner did not allow a hit after Tony Cruz homered to give the Cardinals a 3-2 lead with two outs in the fourth, working eight efficient innings. Matt Adams also went deep in the fourth. Santiago Casilla worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the top of the ninth for the win. Adams drew a one-out walk and Daniel Descalso entered to pinch run. Randal Grichuk singled and Descalso reached third on Kolten Wong's grounder. Looking ahead: After tonight's celebration, the team will start to prepare for the start of the all-wild card series against the Royals which begins next Tuesday . Huddle: Ishikawa is grabbed by his teammates in a huddle following the 6-3 win against the St. Louis Cardinals . Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford snagged the chopper that glanced off diving third baseman Sandoval's glove, then Crawford threw to second for the force. Cruz walked to load the bases with two outs after consecutive pitches near his head, and Giants manager Bruce Bochy lifted him for Jeremy Affeldt. Pitching for the fourth straight day, the lefty retired pinch-hitter Oscar Taveras on a grounder that Affeldt fielded and sprinted to first. Out to prove himself, Wainwright rediscovered his old postseason rhythm after a couple of rough October outings, and that still wasn't enough once the bullpen took over with a one-run lead. Once Wainwright left the game, the Giants grabbed their chance. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny turned to Neshek after Wainwright reached 97 pitches and retired his final 10 batters in order. For the bottom of the ninth, Matheny made a move that will be second-guessed all offseason. He went with Wacha, the hard-throwing star of the 2013 NLCS. But Wacha had missed much of the summer with an injury and last pitched on Sept. 26. UP NEXT .","Travis Ishikawa hit a homer to end the NL Championship Series .

"A renowned pathologist testified he could not determine whether a neurologist was fatally poisoned by her husband, a University of Pittsburgh medical researcher on trial for criminal homicide. Dr. Cyril Wecht said he reached that conclusion based on conflicting blood test results and evidence that Dr. Autumn Klein's death could have been due to another cause, such as a heart problem. 'You've got a mixed batch and that's what leads me at this point and today to the conclusion that it's undetermined,' Wecht said, when asked about the cause and manner of Klein's death. Wecht was among the last defense witnesses being called Wednesday, the 10th day of testimony in the trial of Dr. Robert Ferrante, 66.Allegheny County prosecutors say Ferrante laced his 41-year-old wife's energy drink with cyanide in April 2013, moments before she fell suddenly ill in their kitchen. She died three days later. Dr Robert Ferrante (left) is currently on trial for criminal homicide after his wife, neurologist Autumn Klein (right), died in April 2013. Prosecutors say Klein was murdered with a dose of cyanide, but an expert testified Wednesday that she could have actually died from a heart problem . Previous testimony has suggested Klein was pressuring Ferrante to have another child — the couple, married in 2001, had a 6-year-old daughter when Klein died — and that Ferrante had texted Klein to suggest the energy drink might help them conceive. Other testimony showed someone used Ferrante's computers to search for information on cyanide poisoning in the weeks before Klein died and, after she died but before he was arrested, on how a coroner might detect the poison. The defense called Wecht to counter blood test evidence and a prosecution expert's testimony that Klein was poisoned. A test done by Quest Diagnostics on blood drawn from Klein hours after she collapsed in her home showed a lethal level of cyanide. But that result wasn't known to investigators until after Klein was dead and her body cremated. If convicted, Dr Ferrante (center) could stand to spend the rest of his life in prison. Pictured above in court on October 23 . A county crime lab test also confirmed cyanide in Klein's blood, but not a specific level. The medical examiner's office then sent another blood sample to NMS Labs, which couldn't test the blood because of an equipment malfunction and because a calibrating experiment indicated another testing method wasn't reliable. NMS eventually found a cyanide metabolite — a substance created when the poison is broken down in the bloodstream — but only at a level that could normally occur in a person's blood. Previous testimony has suggested Klein was pressuring Ferrante to have another child  and that Ferrante had texted Klein to suggest the energy drink might help them conceive. Investigators believe that drink was poisoned . Wecht said the disparity between the Quest and NMS results left him unable to definitively determine the cause and manner of Klein's death. 'One would lead me to determine it's a homicide,' Wecht said, 'while the other leads me to believe it was a natural death.' Wecht, who served two separate 10-year terms as county coroner, is well known in the Pittsburgh area and is a celebrity of sorts nationally, having consulted on the deaths of JonBenet Ramsey and Elvis Presley, among others. He first gained widespread fame as a critic of the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald alone assassinated President John F. Kennedy in 1963. The prosecution's main expert, a University of Virginia professor who wrote a book on criminal poisoning, Dr. Christopher Holstege, previously discounted the possibility that Klein died from a heart arrhythmia or some other sudden, unexplained cause because he said the evidence for other causes was lacking. Wecht said he couldn't rule out natural causes because of what he considers conflicting blood test results. 'That's the basis for my opinion,' Wecht said. 'I'm stuck. I'm intellectually stuck.' The defense expected to call some brief witnesses before resting Wednesday. Closing arguments were expected Thursday, after which the jury will be sequestered until a verdict. The prosecution is seeking a first-degree murder conviction, which carries a mandatory life prison sentence.","Dr Robert Ferrante, 66, is currently on trial after his wife died of a suspected poisoning in April 2013 .

Despite the . goal taking him to eleven in his last 10 appearances for the national . side, van Persie’s goal came as quite a surprise after an abject . first-half performance. The . United attacker was anonymous in the first half, completing just a . single pass as Holland were outthought and outmuscled by their . opponents. A fine . individual goal from Arjen Robben gave Holland the lead in the 20th . minute, before former Evertn star Tim Cahill equalised for Australia . with an outrageous first-time volley.

"Italy defender Ignazio Abate claims England's new wave have the quality to take the World Cup by storm. The Italians knocked England out of Euro 2012 on penalties in the last eight but there is a feeling the two teams who meet in Manaus on Saturday may have moved in opposite directions since. Cesare Prandelli’s team are misfiring. They have not won since September and were unable to beat minnows Luxembourg in a friendly last week. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the Italy squad training in Brazil . Cautious: Italy defender Ignazio Abate (second from right) believes England could spring a surprise at the World Cup in Brazil . No way through: Abate shoots during Italy's disappointing 1-1 friendly draw with Luxembourg . Roy Hodgson’s team were held to a goalless draw by Honduras in Miami on Saturday but youngsters like Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley have added vibrancy and freshness. 'England have changed a lot,' said AC Milan full-back Abate. 'They have created a good mix and they could be the revelation of this World Cup. 'It will be a very difficult match, but I am convinced we will arrive in the best physical and mental condition. We need to erase what has been done previously and start again with great humility. 'At the Euros we started with a lot of scepticism, no-one bet a Euro on us, but we got to the final thanks to our desire to surprise. 'That should be the task in the World Cup too. We can’t think we are a great team who can play within itself or wait for an individual to come up with the goods. 'As long as we don’t lose our humility and willingness to make sacrifices, we can cause anyone problems.' Juventus centre-half Giorgio Chiellini recalls the performance against England, in Kiev, two years ago, as one of the best by the Italians in that tournament but echoed Abate’s view that Hodgson’s team had progressed. Impact: Ross Barkley (right) showed glimpses of his ability after coming on during England's 0-0 draw with Honduras . Danger man: Daniel Sturridge (left) will be looking to replicate his form for Liverpool in Brazil . 'They have brought a group on, a Liverpool contingent, who have done very well,' said Chiellini. 'Maybe as individuals they have changed more compared to us, but their way of playing remains the same. 'It will be a tough match. Certainly, the weather factor will also be very important. Everyone has been scared of Manaus so we are curious to see what it’s like to play there. 'We will be ready.

"Heather Watson threw away three match points as she was knocked out of the Aegon Classic first round on Tuesday. Not quite the start  to the grass-court season watching Fed Cup captain Judy Murray may have had in mind. The British No 1 dominated the first set against Aleksandra Wozniak from Canada, a player 66  places below her in the world rankings, but then squandered a 4-1 lead in the second and failed to close out the match on her own serve. Lacklustre: Heather Watson was not at her best against Aleksandra Wozniak in the AEGON Classic . Disappointed: Fed Cup captain Judy Murray, left, watched Watson beaten but the Brit insists it won't affect her . The 22-year-old from Guernsey battled back from 3-0 down in the final set to level at 4-4, but Wozniak, 26, needed only one match point to seal the clash. Watson insisted defeat at Edgbaston will not disrupt her preparations for Wimbledon, where she will largely carry British hopes in the women’s draw in the absence of Laura Robson, who had wrist surgery in April. Watson, the world No 69, said: ‘No, it’s just a match. You know, I’m still alive. It’s no big deal. ‘About the middle of the second set I stopped serving as well, so then I got pushed back and wasn’t playing as aggressively as I wanted to. She definitely improved her game. At the beginning she was making a lot of unforced errors, and then in the third set she played unbelievable. She was hitting lines and net cords. There wasn’t much I could do.’ Carry on: Watson played down the importance of the defeat and will now turn her attention to Wimbledon . None of the world’s top 20 women have a full-time female coach but Wozniak works with 1998 Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat. Watson, however, who is coached by Argentinian Diego Veronelli, is clearly already fed up of the fuss surrounding Andy Murray’s decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo. ‘I think I don’t really care if you’re male or female,’ she said. ‘I don’t see the big deal. Everybody is a making a big deal out of being female.’ Wozniak will now face Johanna Konta in the second round after the 23-year-old Briton beat  Japanese 14th seed Kurumi Nara 6-3, 6-1. Konta said: ‘I felt I played quite a solid match. The first rounds of a tournament can always be a bit more nerve-racking, so I’m just happy that I took care of business on my end.’ Progress: Johanna Konta was one Brit to make progress and will now face Wozniak in the second round . But there was disappointment for Watson’s doubles partner Naomi Broady, who also went ahead before losing 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 to Barbora Zahlavova Strycova from the Czech Republic. Broady will be among the British players hoping for a Wimbledon wildcard when they are announced on Wednesday. The 24-year-old admitted the guaranteed £27,000 in prize money if she could progress through qualifying to secure a first-round match at the All England Club would be particularly welcome. She said: ‘This time last year I started looking into other things I could do because I couldn’t financially fund myself at all. ‘If it wasn’t for my Wimbledon wildcard last year, I couldn’t be playing now. I would have stopped last year because I can’t financially afford to play tennis. The prize-money would help my tennis. It would be an amazing opportunity. As long as I didn’t play one of the very top seeds, I would fancy my chances if I serve well.’ Daniela Hantuchova, the defending champion at the Aegon Classic, progressed to the third round after a straight sets win against 17-year-old Belinda Bencic from Switzerland, while No 1 seed Ana Ivanovic beat Mona Barthel from Germany 6-4, 6-1.

"Two Australians have agreed to pay a fine for flying in Indonesian airspace without permits, but will not be free to leave the country immediately. Indonesian fighter jet pilots were moments away from shooting down the light plane piloted by the two Australian nationals who reportedly failed to comply with Indonesia's order to land, on Wednesday. Indonesian pilot Major Wanda Suriansyah said two Sukhoi fighters 'locked' their weapon systems and aimed directly at the Australian plane carrying pilots Graeme Paul Jacklin and Richard Wayne MacLean,Tempo.co reported. Scroll down for video . Graeme Paul Jacklin (front) and Richard Wayne MacLean (back) were taken into custody after being forced to land their light plane after allegedly 'violating' Indonesian airspace on Wednesday . 'If there had been a command to shoot, I would immediately have shot it down, but thank God the pilot was apparently scared and decided to land the plane in Manado,' Major Wanda said. Mr Jacklin and Mr MacLean were en route from Darwin to the Philippines when their light plane was detected over Indonesian waters at 8am on Wednesday. The pair, who are professional delivery pilots, were flying to Cebu in the Philippines to deliver the light plane after selling it. Military spokesperson, Major-General Fuad Basya, said the two men did not have permission to fly into Indonesian airspace and initially refused several requests to land, Fairfax Media reports. The pair were en route from Darwin to the Philippines to sell the plane when their aircraft was detected over Indonesian waters at 8am on Wednesday . Mr MacLean and Mr Jacklin were taken from the twin-propellor light aircraft  and questioned . 'Some Australians are stubborn so they ignored the request,' Major Wanda said. Two Indonesian Air Force jets followed the plane and ordered the men to land in Manado shortly after 10.30am local time where they were met by snipers on the tarmac who had their rifles pointed towards the aircraft. On landing at Sam Ratulangi Airport, Manado, about 20 air force and airport officers swarmed the aircraft. They were arrested at gunpoint after being forced to land their light plane by two Indonesian fighter jets for allegedly 'violating' the country's airspace. A witness, Adolof, said about half of them had weapons. 'They were laying on the ground while waiting for the plane to land,' he said. 'After it landed the pilots came out and were searched.' The Australians looked annoyed as they were ordered off the plane and frisked, he told AAP. 'When they got off the plane they were taken to the office, then airport staff took documents from the plane,' he said. Richard MacLean's wife Kaye believes he would have known about obtaining the correct paperwork to fly over Indonesian waters as he 'ferries planes all around the world... it's his job' Consular assistance was provided to the men, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says. After investigations, they had agreed to pay a fine of Rp 60 million ($A5670), airport spokesman Syaifullah Siregar said. 'Yes, they have admitted their mistake and are ready to pay the fine as per our regulations,' he said. 'But before paying the fine, we still must wait for a security clearance.' Air force spokesman Brigadier General Hadi Tjahjanto says the clearance should take 24 hours. With the fine paid and the clearance issued, the Australians will be free to go. 'When we forced down the plane, they didn't have several documents,' he said. He said they need a security clearance issued by Air Force Headquarters and a flight clearance from the Aviation Transportation Directorate General. 'When all the requirements needed for those clearances are complete, it will only take a day to be issued, depending on the requirements they have.' The plane's owner, Mr MacLean, is an experienced pilot and used-aircraft salesman who operates Australian Aircraft Sales in South Australia. Two Indonesian Air Force jets followed the plane and ordered the men to land in Manado shortly after 10.30am local time . His wife, Kaye, said he had completed aircraft deliveries around the world and understood the airspace permissions required, suggesting the incident could be a simple paperwork mishap. 'I think there's a misunderstanding,' she told Fairfax Media. Small aircraft are commonly sold internationally and delivered by air, but airspace permissions are required when flying through a country's territory. Indonesian airforce spokesman Hadi Tjahjanto said the plane came to their attention when it was flying over Timor-Leste - south of the Asian country. 'The plane violated the official path around Saumlaki,' First Marshall Hadi told AAP, referring to a town in Maluku. 'Because they're civilians, the case will be under the authority of airport authorities. 'For now they can't fly, we're waiting until the results of this investigation.' Violating Indonesian airspace carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $200,000 fine, Fairfax Media reports. Mr MacLean had owned the aircraft since 2006. His wife Kaye believes Mr MacLean would have known about obtaining the correct paperwork to fly over Indonesian waters as he 'ferries planes all around the world... it's his job'. 'I think there's a misunderstanding.'","Two Indonesian Air Force jets were ready to shoot at an Australian light plane on Wednesday .

"Passengers were left terrified when an Alitalia plane was struck by lightning as it flew through a severe storm over Italy on Wednesday night. The captain chose to make an emergency landing after the commercial aircraft’s right engine was hit by a lightning bolt on a cross-country flight from Ancona.

"Brazil captain Thiago Silva has come up with a novel way of limiting the impact of Argentina star Lionel Messi at the World Cup - drawing a gun on him. ‘The only way of stopping Messi is with a gun,’ said the Paris Saint-Germain defender, in an interview with Brazil sports magazine Placar. ‘He is the attacker who keeps you awake when you play against him. I faced him three times with AC Milan and once with PSG. When the game goes to one side of the field, he is alone on the other. Star man: Thiago Silva joked the only way to stop Argentina's Lionel Messi is with a gun . ‘Despite recent injuries, he is a guy who will work very hard at the World Cup.’ Silva, who has 46 international caps for Brazil, said he would love for the hosts to face Argentina, Germany or Spain in the final at the Maracana on July 13. ‘Argentina would be a classic. Or Germany, for a rematch of the 2002 World Cup final. Or Spain, since the Spanish are also calling for a rematch after we beat them in the Confederations Cup final last year. Sergio Ramos said the story would be different at the World Cup.’ When asked how a rematch with Spain might end differently, he said: ‘Suddenly Brazil only win 1-0, right?’ Talent: Silva will be hoping Brazil can stop Messi if they face Argentina during the World Cup . The centre-back also spoke about his move from AC Milan to Paris Saint-Germain and how his dream as a youngster was to one day play for Barcelona. ‘When I arrived in Milan, I thought I would end my career there, or at least play some 10 years there and then finish in Brazil.

"Beware: Facebook photos that five-years-old can still come back to bite you. Or so a California school board candidate has discovered this week, after photos taken of his 14-year-old self dressed in a Nazi uniform resurfaced. Parents and PTA members have expressed outrage at the images of Sage Naumann, 19, a candidate for the Carlsbad Unified School District Board of Trustees, and supporters have started withdrawing their recommedations for him as a result. The photos were taken five years ago, showing Naumann in a military uniform and were accompanied with offensive Nazi jokes such as: 'Sad Natsi mourns the loss of ze Fuhrer.' Another of the captions posted by Naumann read: 'Angry German waiting for candy.' 'Disturbing': Parents and PTA members in Carlsbad, California - north of San Diego - have expressed outrage after these five-year-old pictures of local school board candidate Sage Naumann resurfaced . 'Angry German': Naumann - now 19 - maintains the costume is meant to be German communist and not Nazi . Naumnann told UT San Diego that he bought the 'costume' online for $75 and that is meant to depeict a German communist, not a Nazi. He said at the time - Halloween 2009 - friends called him a Nazi and he followed on with the joke. Naumann told the newspaper that it was a lapse in judgement made by a teenager, but did not apologize for his actions. 'It is the most ridiculous thing. They are trying to make me look like I’m anti-Semitic or a Nazi supporter,' Naumann said. 'I was 14 years old at this party. The uniform isn’t a Nazi uniform. 'If it was a Nazi uniform, and that makes me anti-Semitic, if I wore a devil uniform then does that make me a Satanist?' Naumann, a fiscal conservative, has been profiled on the San Diego Rostra blog as a rising Republican star. Lapse in judgement: Naumann, who has been called a rising Republican, said a mistake in judgement as a teenager does not make him a Nazi supporter . The offending pictures have since been deleted from Facebook, but were first circulated among parents and PTA members on email. One parent, Mike Guerreiro, described them as 'pretty disturbing'. 'Every single person has done stupid things when they are young, but nobody I know has ever, ever dressed as a Nazi and posted it on their Facebook page,' Guerreiro told UT San Diego. After viewing the photos, Sen. Mark Wyland, R-Carlsbad, withdrew his support of Naumann. 'Although I am not Jewish, my daughter would be considered Jewish because her mother is,' he told the paper. 'Many of my closest friends are Jewish. 'I have long supported Israel in its fight literally for survival against those who would destroy it. 'Naumann was very young when this occurred, but for all these reasons, I will withdraw my endorsement.'","Sage Naumann, 19, is a candidate for the Carlsbad Unified School District Board of Trustees in California .

"They're the dust collecting items in your home that could actually make you a small fortune and people are starting to cash in on everything from old teapots to strange sculptures. Research shows Australians have earned close to an additional $4,000 per person in the past year through the sale of unwanted goods - enough to cover a household’s entire petrol bill for a year. But there is still cash to be made with the average Australian holding onto 23 unwanted items in their home, according to the Second Hand Economy Report by Australia’s Gumtree website. Only six percent of Australians get their unwanted goods valued, so Gumtree partnered with TV valuers, the Aussie Pickers, to help put a price on people's dust collecting items .

The kookiest item Mr Callaghan valued was a unique silver plated and incredibly tarnished trophy. The kookiest item Mr Callaghan valued was a unique silver plated and incredibly tarnished trophy, which he believes is worth around $125,000 .

One man brought a commemorative gold-plated $100 Australian note to be valued, which  could fetch more than $1,000 . This handmade square teapot (left) could easily make $300 to $400, while the mass produced Japanese design (right) would be only about $40 to $50 . 'One woman found this tin sculpture left in her shed by her father. It was independently designed and especially made. I don't want to speculate too much, but I believe it's worth around $125,000,' he said. 'It doesn't look like much, but the detail is actually incredible. It's early 19th century I'd say and most likely a decorative piece.' An unexpectedly valuable item was a French blown glass decorative ball, which could easily be mistaken for tacky decoration you would find at a $2 store. 'They're basically paper weights, they're solid glass. I know sometimes they can be valued up to $300,' Mr Callaghan said. Vintage bags can be found almost anywhere and unless from a high-end designer or maker are unlikely to get much return . Vintage posters are also interesting pieces from certain eras, but don't fetch much because they're so widespread . Mr Callaghan said for the average punter selling on sites like Gumtree, it comes down to research and detail to get the highest price . One man brought a commemorative gold-plated $100 Australian note to be valued, which he believes could fetch more than $1,000. 'The money was a great piece but it's hard to value something like that because it's a modern copy of currency. The gentleman paid $1,000 for that. The gold value is there, but when it comes to printable items they've probably got 100 of them.' Vintage crockery can often be of little value even though many people think they are vintage. Considering they're common in second hand shops and even at your grandma's house, they're generally unlikely to get more than $40-$50. But Mr Callaghan came across one unique teapot in the shape of a square he thinks could have easily raked in $400 to $500. This early 1900s Elgin pocket watch was estimated to pay between $300 - $500 . This World War 1 Red Cross Certificate was valued between $300 to $500 . An 1890s Heinz Munschauer solid oak ice box made in Buffalo, New York was estimated to be worth $900 . A vintage Mr Potato Head and his friend Pete the Pepper (original box included) was valued at $40 . 'When you've got a square box teapot that's hand produced sitting next to a teapot that was mass produced, you can see how it would be worth more,' he said. Mr Callaghan said for the average punter selling on sites like Gumtree, it comes down to research and detail to get the highest price. 'If you see something that has loads of detail that is the key. The higher the detail, the higher the value,' he said. 'As Australians we are a hoarding group. We accumulate stuff and we stick it somewhere in our property to forget about.'","Research shows Australians have earned close to $4,000 per person in the past year by selling unwanted goods .

"A designer dog which became an online sensation and attracted thousands of followers after he was bought for £1,600 has been stolen by burglars. Jamie Green, 29, bought Chow Chow puppy Misiu, which means little bear in Polish, as a surprise for his girlfriend five weeks ago. He said he is 'heartbroken' and feels as though he has lost a child after thieves broke into his house in Stanmore, northwest London, on Wednesday. Chow Chow puppy Misiu, which means little bear in Polish, has been stolen by thieves from his London home . 'All I want is for Misiu to come home. It has been a horrible shock and I feel violated. If we get him back I won't press charges,' he told MailOnline. 'He's only three months old, he's a little baby. I feel like someone has stolen my child and I need time to grieve. 'I'm worried that someone saw his picture or his profile online and targeted my house deliberately. I just hope he is being looked after. He is so precious to me. 'I'm scared to go outside but hate being here as someone broke in.' He became an online hit after Mr Green posted photographs of the dog on Imgur, where they were viewed almost 2.5million times. On his Instagram page, which has 138 followers, Misiu is described as: 'A half bear, half dog model' He bought the three-month-old puppy as a surprise present for his girlfriend of two years Joanna Gluminska . A photograph of Misiu on Buzzfeed attracted 80,000 likes and he has 1,110 likes on his Facebook page. Mr Green believes that the thieves were deliberately targeted designer breeds, which can have a high resale value, because they left behind his other dog, a Palmolein called Honey. 'I was coming back from working and I would normally hear him scratching at the door, but I didn't hear anything at all,' he said. 'I called his name, but when I went into the kitchen I saw the window was smashed and there was glass everywhere. It started to dawn on me that he might have been stolen. 'He was the only thing that was taken. They left money, an iPad a laptop and a £1,000 watch. I just hope whoever has taken him is looking after him properly. Owner Jamie Green (left) is convinced he was targeted by dog thieves looking for expensive designer animals, pictured (right) is the damage to him home in Stanmore, northwest London . 'Misiu is such a distinctive dog and I have had so much attention [over] him. People love him. The fact not much was taken and my other dog was left is proof to me they targeted us for Misiu.' On his Instagram page, which has 138 followers, Misiu is described as: 'A half bear, half dog model from London.' Chow Chow dogs are originally from  northern China where they are referred to as Songshi Quan, which means 'puffy-lion dog'. Dog theft is increasing by about 15 per cent annually, according to charity Dog Lost. Spokeswoman Nik Oakley told the Evening Standard: 'In London it is almost always designer dogs that are stolen -expensive pedigree animals that are worth a great deal of money.'","Chow Chow puppy Misiu stolen by burglars who broke into London home .

"Two adventurous French friends show that every cloud has a silver lining as they embrace the most challenging of weather conditions. A biblical downpour of rain, which leads to excessive flooding, fails to quell the exuberance of the two outdoor enthusiasts who paddle down a Montpellier street in a canoe. A local resident filmed the footage of the significant floods and the spontaneous canoe ride which followed using a GoPro camera. The footage shows two the two men canoeing down the side of a busy road near passing cars during flooding which occurred from Sunday into early on Monday morning. The friends can be heard laughing sporadically as they take turns using the canoe and braving the challenging weather conditions. Al Jazeera reported that, in the space of just three hours, a massive 252mm of rain fell in the city of Montpellier. The widespread flooding has adversely affected multiple areas and regions in France. In 60 southern towns France has declared a state of natural disaster.

"Samsung, the world's biggest smartphone maker, is suffering a financial decline in the face of intense competition from Apple, as well as new Chinese brands. In a preview to earnings due out later this month, Samsung said today its quarterly profit was estimated to have fallen to its lowest level in more than three years - dragged down by weak sales of its new Galaxy model. Compared to a record-high of £6 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company is set to report earnings of just £2.4 billion ($3.8 billion) for July to September this year. Scroll down for video . Samsung (headquarters in Seoul pictured) is set to report its lowest quarterly earnings in more than three years. It comes as the bigger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been linked with luring customers away from the previously bigger Galaxy phone . The South Korean electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand on the popularity of earlier Galaxy models. But the bigger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger Galaxy range. While in China, local brands are making inroads into Samsung's business. Analysts have repeatedly cut forecasts of Samsung's profit this year as Galaxy sales lagged behind expectations. They claim earnings in the quarter ending in September could suffer their biggest decline in Samsung's recent history. In today's report, Samsung said the median forecast of July to September operating income was £2.4billion ($3.8 billion). It's been almost a year since Google released its Nexus 5, and rumours about the next model have been ramping up in recent weeks. The latest reports claim the device, dubbed the Nexus 6, has a 5.9-inch screen and will run Android L - the firm's next-generation operating system. This would put the device in direct competition with Apple's phablet 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus. It would also put it on par with Samsung's flagship Galaxy Note 4, which has a 5.7-inch display. Other rumoured specifications include a 2MP front-facing camera, and camera on the rear that could range between 8MP and 13MP. That was below the median of analysts' expectations of £3 billion ($4.9 billion), according to FactSet, a financial data provider. If it happens, this would reflect a 60 per cent plunge from the record-high £6 billion ($9.5 billion). The decline in Galaxy sales has hurt demand for Samsung components such as an advanced display called OLED. 'The operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price,' Samsung said. The company said it 'cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products'. Analysts said the bigger iPhones released last month will likely take away American customers who favored the Galaxy's bigger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals. Samsung estimated sales for the July to September period declined 20 per cent from a year earlier to £27.4 billion ($44 billion), slightly below analysts' expectations of £29.3 billion ($47 billion). In January, analysts estimated Samsung's third quarter operating income would exceed £5.8 billion ($9.3 billion). That expectation has been steadily lowered to about half this month. Quarterly profit from its mobile business, which reached £3.9 billion ($6.3 billion)  a year earlier, is forecast to be a little over £1.2 billion ($1.9 billion). Analysts claim the bigger iPhones released last month (shown) will likely take away customers who favoured the Galaxy's larger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals . The latest news comes despite the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 (pictured) earlier this year, which was received by mostly rave reviews. The Galaxy S5 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset, with some calling it a 'superphone' The company needs to revamp its handset designs, said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities. 'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' he said. 'The iPhone 6 will be a significant threat to Samsung.' The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple. Last month, Samsung also received upbeat initial responses to its Galaxy Note Edge smartphone, a smartphone with a curved side screen that can display weather, news, apps and other information. But the supply volume for the Edge smartphone will be limited, likely not giving a big boost to its earnings, analysts added. With growth momentum in smartphones sagging, Samsung is moving to step up its presence in the semiconductor business. This week, Samsung announced a £9 billion ($15 billion) investment plan to build a new semi-conductor fabrication plant in the South Korean city of Pyeongtaek. The construction will begin before the summer next year and begin operations during the second half of 2017.

"Making whisky requires three ingredients - water, yeast and a grain, primarily barley. But 90 per cent of the output consists of waste by-products . Whisky-making can be a wasteful business. More than 1.6 billion litres of pot ale, and half a million metric tonnes of ‘draff’ are produced as by-products each year - and the majority is thrown away. Now a firm in Scotland wants to put this waste to good use to power our cars, feed our animals and even make plastics. Edinburgh-based Celtic Renewables was formed in 2011. It has spent the past three years refining its recycling process based on a century-old fermentation technique, and is now taking the next step toward a commercial plant, according to the American Chemical Society. Making whisky requires three ingredients - water, yeast and a grain, primarily barley. But only 10 per cent of the output is alcohol that can be sold. The main waste products include a residual solid called draff, and a yeast-based liquid known as pot ale. Pot all is the copper-containing liquid created by the stills, and draff is made up of used barley grains. This waste is spread on agricultural lands, turned into low-grade animal feed or discarded into the sea. Rather than inefficiently re-using these materials or letting them go to waste, Celtic Renewables has taken an old industrial process developed to turn molasses and other sugars into chemicals, and fine-tuned it to convert draff and pot ale into acetone, biobutanol and ethanol. The latter two can be used as fuel. The company is scaling up its process with the help of the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change, private funds, and Bio Base Europe. And if all goes to plan, a commercial facility could be next. The company is initially focused on developing biobutanol - a next generation biofuel that has almost the same energy value as petrol and gasoline. The main waste products include a residual solid called draff, and a yeast-based liquid known as pot ale. Celtic Renewables has taken an industrial process developed to turn molasses and other sugars into chemicals, and fine-tuned it to convert these products (pictured) into acetone, biobutanol and ethanol . Following the successful fermentation of the draff and pot ale (distillery pictured) to create biobutanol, the solid residue left is separated to produce animal feed. Celtic Renewables said the feed has a high protein and is ‘ideal for the cattle and dairy cow feed markets' These types of fuels also produce 25 per cent more energy per unit volume than bioethanol, a fuel created from agricultural feed.

Following the successful fermentation of the draff and pot ale to create biobutanol, the solid residue left is separated to produce animal feed. The process also produces acetone, a widely-used chemical and solvent. About half of world’s acetone is used to make acrylic plastics such as Perspex. It is also the starting point for other plastics such as epoxy resins and polycarbonates. It is easier to store, is less corrosive, and safer to handle than bioethanol, and works in unmodified engines with petrol. It can also be blended with diesel and biodiesel. Biobutanol was legally recognised as a biofuel in the 2009 amendment to the Road Transport Fuel Obligation. This is the UK implementation of the EU Renewable Energy Directive, which dictates that 5 per cent of the UK’s transport fuel comes from a renewable source by 2013, and 10 per cent by 2020.

Celtic Renewables said the feed has a high protein and is ‘ideal for the cattle and dairy cow feed markets.’ The process also produces acetone, a widely-used chemical and solvent. The UK depends on imports of acetone, from the EU and, in particular Spain, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. In 2008, 164,000 tonnes were imported at a cost of almost £100 million. About half of world’s acetone is used to make acrylic plastics such as Perspex. It is also the starting point for other plastics such as epoxy resins and polycarbonates. The technology was developed by the Biofuel Research Centre at Edinburgh Napier University by Professor Martin Tangney and his team. The research was completed in 2010.","Making whisky requires three ingredients - water, yeast and grain .

"For 36 years Circus Oz has captivated audiences in a world of fantasy through their  comical performances of incredible craftsmanship. Circus barriers were broken down when two already well-known Australian groups - Soapbox Circus and the New Ensemble Circus - came together and founded Circus Oz in 1977. They developed unique play and group creativity, extraordinary physicality and a playful relationship between spectator and performer. The Australian performance group's first act was in 1978. What separated Circus Oz from other circus acts was their contemporary performances, including cabaret, popular music, comedy, movement, visual and music theatre and physical performance. David Carlin, Professor Associate at the School of Media and Communication has worked with Circus Oz for four years on an interactive exhibition that includes never-seen footage. He said there is a real unique attitude that is projected by the performers in Circus Oz. 'The performers are doing extraordinary things but what is really amazing is there is a real connection with the audience,' Mr Carlin, told Daily Mail Australia. 'There is a sense of real people and closeness that is established - the audience really cares about what they [performers] are doing and who they are.' Circus Oz has performed on every continent and tens of thousands have flocked to see their artistic performances. 'The sense of humour is an important part of what they do. Sometimes it is a bit bent, satirical or has a political bite and other times it is really wacky and silly. It has a nice combination of being able to not take themselves too seriously,' Mr Carlin said. Each show crosses boundaries as acrobats walk on tight-ropes, play with fire, jump from high ceilings and swing from the roof top. Bright coloured lights and eccentric costumes are used to tell their unique fantastical story. 'Circus is the theatre of the impossible and Circus Oz has always approached the impossible in its own irreverent way,' said Mr Carlin. Now the 'Vault' of Circus Oz will be unlocked with the release of rarely-seen footage  at the Melbourne Festival. 'Vault sets out to embody this spirit of playfulness within the form of its displays,' Mr Carlin said. 'There will be lots of different things for different people to discover. For some it will be the spectacle of the beauty and grace of seeing bodies doing amazing things - which is what circus is all about.' The 'Vault' is presented by Melbourne Festival in association with RMIT University and the Circus Oz Living Archive and will be free to the public from October 10 to October 26. Scroll down for video . Founded in 1977, Circus Oz has captivated audiences world-wide with their unique style of contemporary performance . Circus Oz performers go above and beyond to captivate audiences - as teams of acrobats play with rings of fire . Robyn McGregor from Circus Oz said, 'Contortionist Sosina Wogayehu (pictured, right) came up with an idea to contort in a clear box that could be filled with popcorn. A few years later, after practicing in her bath at home, Sosi was able to perform the contortion underwater. The box was converted to hold liquid and in this version Nicci Wilks (pictured, left) returned to Circus Oz and played 'the shortest, fattest, loudest woman in the world' whilst Sosi performed her daring underwater contortion act' The performances are built on teamwork rather than individual stars, as acrobats work together to entertain audiences through innovative craftsmanship . Robyn McGregor  said, 'Circus Oz contains nothing but 100% human animals, but that’s never stopped us from taking on the guise of various creatures from the animal kingdom. Most recognisably Australian, completely iconic and extending back to the beginning of Circus Oz are the red kangaroos who have created chaos and humour around the globe. Not to be contained to the stage the red kangaroos have been photographed in various locations including Times Square New York, Plazo Mayor Madrid and Calton Hill Edinburgh' They developed unique play and group creativity, extraordinary physicality and a playful relationship between spectator and performer .

"Following a month floating in space, the last of a group of 'super moustronauts’ has been dissected. Astronauts cut open 10 out of 20 mice to send tissue samples back on the SpaceX Dragon capsule that returned to Earth on Saturday. The rest of the mice were dissected on Monday and are due to be returned to Earth on December 9 as part of Nasa’s tissue research. Scroll down for video . A group of 'super moustronauts' was last month launched into space with remarkable abilities. These mice lacked a gene that normal mice have, called Muscle Ring Finger 1 (MuRF-1), which causes muscles to deteriorate. They have now been dissected and tissue samples sent back to Earth . This group of mice included some that lacked a gene that normal mice have, called Muscle Ring Finger 1 (MuRF-1), which causes muscles to deteriorate. Scientists claim that by analysing the super mice in microgravity, they could create drugs for use by humans to prevent muscle loss on Earth. These ‘super mice’ were the first mammals, excluding humans, to spend a month in space. The typical stay for mice for previous missions has been around two weeks. MuRF-1 is responsible for marking proteins for destruction in both human and mouse muscles. Nasa created special homes for the mice to live in on the space station, which include systems to stop their food and water from floating around . It also plays a key role in accelerated muscle loss through ageing and other chronic diseases. Six national space programs have so far flown animals into space: the Soviet Union, the United States, France, China, Japan and Iran. They were used as surrogates to test the suitability of the space environment for human habitation. Fruit flies were the first animals to be sent into orbit when they were put on board a U.S.-launched V-2 rocket on February 20, 1947. Two years later, Albert II, a Rhesus Monkey, became the first monkey to go into space. In November 1957 Russia sent Laika the dog into orbit aboard the Soviet Sputnik 2 spacecraft. Then, on January 31, 1961, Ham became the first chimpanzee launched into outer space as part of the Nasa space programme. For their mission, Nasa created special homes for the mice to live in on the space station, which included systems to stop their food and water from floating around. 'By flying a mouse, whose typical lifespan is much shorter than humans', you can follow the course of bone and muscle loss over a much greater percentage of the mouse lifespan than you can in humans,' Michael Roberts, the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space's senior research manager, told Francie Diep at Popular Science. This is of particular interest to space agencies who are racing to get the first humans on Mars. Any astronaut undertaking the journey will need to spend long stretches in space. However, microgravity in space means that astronauts no longer need to use certain muscles, causing them to slowly waste away. 'Muscles are the storage space for amino acids, the only reservoir for them,' said Sam Cadena, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research program manager. 'If you lose muscle, you lose health.' The mice were the first mammals, excluding humans, to spend a month in space. The typical stay for mice in earlier experiments has been around two weeks. Pictured are researchers preparing the mice for launch .","Mice were first mammals, excluding humans, to spend a month in space .

"A mother who was five months pregnant  died just yards from her home in a road accident after she went on a short trip to nearby shops. Stephanie Charles was struck by a vehicle while trying to cross the southbound carriageway of the A90 when she went to get something to eat near her home in Aberdeen. Her partner Mark Robertson has revealed the mother-of-one, who died at the scene, was five months pregnant. He said his 'whole world just collapsed' when he found out it was the 'happy' and 'smiling' 33-year-old involved in the crash. Stephanie Charles was five months pregnant when she died in a road accident near her Aberdeen home . Mr Robertson said he was expecting Ms Charles home when he looked out of the window and saw a lot of cars and people had gathered nearby. He said: 'Never in a million years did I think it would be her. The next thing we knew, the police were at the door. 'She was five months pregnant. It really is a tragedy.' Ms Charles has a 10-year-old daughter and was well-known in the area and was regarded as having a happy disposition. Mr Robertson's mother Margaret said:  'We just did not see this coming. Something like this happens and your whole life just changes in five seconds. 'She was such a happy girl. She was happy all the time. She was always smiling and she would do anything for you. Ms Charles, a mother-of-one, had gone to nearby shops to get something to eat when she was knocked down . Ms Charles was involved in the accident on the southbound carriageway of the A90 in Aberdeen on Saturday . 'She was just that kind of lassie. She had a room full of things for the baby. She was so excited about it. 'This all just feels like a horrible dream.' Ms Charles also has three sisters and a brother. Her older sister, Pamela, was too upset to talk about the accident, but said she had been left 'devastated' by it. A neighbour added: 'It's terrible. I just spoke to her yesterday. She was very well known in the area. 'I did hear an ambulance last night but you always hear ambulances. It's an awful road.' The driver and passengers in the vehicle were not hurt by the accident which happened just after 7pm on Saturday night.

"Two 'Stop The Violence' activists have been charged with severely beating a former roommate and fellow campaigner after he let himself into their flat to collect his belongings. Nikole Ardeno and Emanuel Velez, both 30, were wearing anti-abuse t-shirts when they allegedly attacked Joshua Magraff as he was walking down the street in Washington, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday about 4.30 pm. Accusing him of burglary, the defendants  kicked the victim as he was unconscious, causing him to have seizures and vomit blood, according to Washington police Chief Chris Luppino. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Charged: Nikole Ardeno (left) and Emanuel Velez (right) have been charged with severely beating up their former roommate and fellow Stop The Violence campaigner just hours after a protest through Washington . Ardeno was still wearing the same 'Stop the Violence' shirt that she had worn the night before as she led a march in the city protesting two recent shootings, the chief said. Police believe Ardeno and Velez attacked Magraff because he had gone to an apartment all three shared to collect his belongings after moving out. Ardeno and Velez had come to the police station about 20 minutes before the alleged attack to claim that Magraff was burglarizing the apartment, but police said Magraff appeared to only be taking items that belonged to him as he moved out, Luppino said. Magraff was still unconscious and in critical condition Wednesday at UPMC Mercy hospital in Pittsburgh, Luppino said. A hospital spokeswoman could not update Magraff's condition Thursday because officials there don't release information about alleged crime victims. Ardeno, Velez, and Magraff, are all members of the Pennsylvania-based group. Controversy: Leaders of the campaign group insist they do not tolerate violence and will investigate the claims . Ardeno 'is a big part of that group,' the chief said, and Velez 'is very active with them.' The group's leader, Suzanne Kelley, said she hoped to speak with Ardeno about her version of the incident, but said the group does not condone violence. 'We do not promote violence at all, and I can't believe this is going on. I don't want the community to get a negative effect from this because they back us,' Kelley said of the defendants. Online court records don't list an attorney for the defendants who face a preliminary hearing Nov. 10 on charges of aggravated assault, conspiracy, simple assault and disorderly conduct. Ardeno remained in the Washington County Jail on Thursday, but Velez had posted bail. He does not have a listed phone number.","Nikole Ardeno and Emanuel Velez, 30, 'kicked Joshua Magraff in the street at 4.30 pm Tuesday as he was unconscious, having seizures, vomiting blood'

"Australian parents' hip pockets are being hit hard by the rising expenses of school camps and excursions, prompting concerns on children from low-income families missing out. Parents are battling to pay even the basic costs of a public-school education but a new survey has revealed costs of school trips  range from $250 to $1100. While schools regularly offer financial help, parents have had to plan months ahead for when unexpected extras like school trips come up to make sure their kids are not the only ones left out. Parents' hip pockets are being hit hard by the rising expenses of primary school camps and excursions . Sydney Morning Herald reports year 6 students from Lindfield Public School went away for five nights in August at a cost of $1100 per student. The cost covered two nights in Canberra, three nights at a ski-lodge in Jindabyne, ski lessons, equipment hire and lift pass. Year 9 students from Mosman High School went away for a five-night camp, costing $924, which covered accommodation, a three-day ski-lift pass, equipment hire and daily skiing lessons. Year 6 students from Gapuwiyak School in Northern Territory flew to Sydney for a week-long excursion, at a cost of around $1500, which covers airfares, activities and accommodation. 'The trip is usually subsidised by one of the health organisations so parents only cover the costs of airfares for their child, which is usually $1000,' teacher Mick Montague told Daily Mail Australia. Despite the rising expenses, Cabramatta West Public School teacher Mathew Halloran told Daily Mail Australia that school camps were a good opportunity for kids to experience independence. 'The best thing about school camp is giving the kids a chance to look after themselves for a few days, which works on their organisation, social skills and confidence. New survey reveals costs of school trips across Sydney schools range from $250 to $1100 . While some camps have hit the $1000 mark in the city, country schools have had financial assistance  to help subsidise the costs of excursions. Former Gulgong High School student, who wished to not be named, told Daily Mail Australia that going to school in a country town, camps were often subsidised for educational trips. 'When I went to ones purely for academic reasons, we often got grants from government groups where they'd subsidise our transport and accommodation so we could go,' she said. A Caragabal Public School teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said being at a small rural school, expenses are not as expensive compared to larger schools. 'We have a really small school so we receive extra funding for different reasons, which also helps subsidise the costs of excursions,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'However, normally in larger schools, parents would have to foot the entire bill so they can get expensive.' Parents have had to plan months ahead for when unexpected extras like school excursions come up to make sure their kids can go . A NSW Department of Education spokesman told Sydney Morning Herald: 'Where financial hardship is understood to be the reason for a student's non-participation, schools must endeavour to provide financial assistance,' the spokesman said. 'Unless exceptional circumstances exist, all students should have the opportunity to participate in an excursion.","Parents are battling to pay even the basic costs of a public-school education .

'It dragged him, climbed on top of him, was kicking him, biting him and sat on top of him.' Following the incident, the dromedary, a type of camel predominantly from the Middle East and North Africa. was taken away by Mexico's federal agency of environmental protection Profepa. In a court affadivit, a park employee said he was was in another part of the park when he heard Mr Mileski screaming for help. He then rushed to scene and tried to beat the camel away with a stick.

"An investigation by animal rights activists has uncovered abuses in the production of 'cat poo coffee', as the demand for the delicacy rises in Australia. Animal coffee, or kopi luvac, is the world's most expensive coffee, created by feeding cat-like creatures - civits - coffee berries that are extracted after passing through the creature's digestive system and excreted. The production of civit coffee has grown to commercial proportions in the Philippines and Indonesia, sparking concerns by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) that civits are being force fed to meet demands. Scroll down for video . An investigation by animal rights activists have uncovered abuses in the production of 'cat poo coffee', as the demand for the delicacy rises in Australia. Animal coffee, or kopi luvac, is the world's most expensive coffee, and can be sold for up to $50 per cup . The beans are created by feeding cat-like creatures civits coffee berries that are extracted after passing through the creature's digestive system and excreted. The growing popularity of the tea in Australia and other countries has been linked to the increase in 'asian palm civet farms', reported Perth Now. The small creatures are allegedly being held in dirty cages and made to eat the coffee berries in proportions much higher than naturally observed, resulting in abuse of the civits. PETA has released undercover video footage which shows the condition of civits in confinement, in which the creatures show behaviour consistent with distress such as bar-biting, head-bobbing and spinning in their cages. A spokeswoman from PETA, Claire Fryer, said that drinkers of the coffee should be concerned about the production methods used to extract the beans. 'It would be nearly impossible to sustain a viable (kopi luwak) enterprise by collecting the beans from civet faeces in the wild,' Ms Fryer said. 'We know some of the beans are still being marketed as “wild sourced” but that is unlikely to be the case.' PETA investigators allege that they discovered whole villages in Indonesia and the Philippines involved in unregulated production of Asian palm civets. 'One farmer explained that generally the civets are kept for a maximum of three years then released back into the wild but many would not survive,' Ms Fryer said.

'They’re suffering a lot for a cup of coffee.' Cafe's in Australia are continuing to serve the coffee, despite the concerns raised by PETA. The Heritage Tea Rooms in Townsville count the delicacy as one of the most popular items on the menu, and are reportedly looking to keep it there. Tea Rooms owner Michelle Sharpe said that the business had made sure the beans were being produced ethically. 'It's wild beans,' she said. 'We've verified that. (PETA) can go and check out the plantation.' 'We have nothing to be concerned about.' However Ms Fryer said PETA found that coffee farmers were seeking to produce the most amount of coffee in the cheapest way possible. 'That involves keeping civets in cages and feeding them a steady diet of coffee berries when they would normally eat a variety of things in the wild. It can actually make them very sick.' Jason Baker, PETA Australia director of campaigns, urged consumers to boycott civet coffee.

"Sitting in the dentist’s waiting room, the receptionist called out brightly: ‘Mrs Hodgkinson?’ I was on my feet without hesitation, even though the word ‘Mrs’ was almost as painful as the dentist’s drill. I haven’t been a Mrs for nearly 30 years and, truth to tell, I’m not really a Hodgkinson either. It is my former husband’s surname, not mine, but it’s far too late to change and revert to my original surname. That is why I felt a pang of jealousy when I read in last week’s Mail that Jemima Khan is to become Jemima Goldsmith again. Liz felt a pang of jealousy when she read in last week’s Mail that Jemima Khan (left) is to become Jemima Goldsmith again, having kept her ex-husband Imran Khan's (right) surname for so long . She became a Khan in 1995 when she married Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. Despite their divorce in 2004, until now she has remained a Khan. Ostensibly, she is going back to her maiden roots because her former husband is considering remarrying, which means there would be two Mrs Imran Khans. But others have suggested Imran is unlikely to have been overjoyed to see the Khan name associated with louche comedian Russell Brand, whom Jemima dated recently. When my husband and I split up in 1988, after 23 years together, I kept his name for practical reasons. During our married life, I had become reasonably well known as a writer and it seemed professional suicide to revert to my original name, Garrett, a name nobody recognised. The name had become, as we might say today, a kind of brand. Jemima is going back to her maiden roots because her former husband is considering remarrying, which means there would be two Mrs Imran Khans . So, against my feminist principles, I had little choice but to stay with a surname that bore absolutely no relation to my status or lifestyle. I was, and would remain, a single woman stuck with a married name, even though I called myself Miss on official documents. Jemima, of course, coming from such an illustrious family, will not have to reinvent herself anew with an unknown name, but will be able to pass seamlessly back from Khan to Goldsmith. One has to wonder why she has stuck with Khan for so long. She says she originally kept it as her two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim, felt strongly about it, but that now they’re grown up they don’t seem to care. When my sons Tom and Will were children, it made things neat and easy for us all to have the same surname, especially when travelling as a family. Now they are middle-aged and well-known writers themselves, I can bask in a little reflected glory. But it would be more dignified now, I feel, for me to have a different identity. There have been stories recently of women being stopped at airports because they have a different surname to their children and have had to explain at great length that they really are their mothers. Border officials are, of course, worried about trafficking. But for many women these days, it is an unforeseen consequence of hanging on to your maiden name. I thought, when I married in 1965 at the age of 21, that it was a legal requirement for women to take their husband’s surname. It was only much later I learned it was merely a custom and never enshrined in law. But at the time, women who kept their own names were considered odd. Didn’t they want to be married? When I married at a very young age, I had not chalked up any achievements whatsoever, and so it seemed I had nothing to lose by taking my husband’s name for all purposes. Little did I know I would bitterly regret not hanging onto my own name, at least professionally. Nowadays it’s common for women to revert to their maiden names on divorce, shaking off the one associated with an ex. Yet some, like Jemima and Cheryl Cole (nee Tweedy) hang onto their ex’s name for years. Cheryl stayed a Cole for four years after splitting from footballer Ashley, and only changed to Versini-Fernandez when she remarried earlier this year. Among my divorced friends, every one has reverted to her maiden name or chosen another neutral surname. Even when they remarried, most of my friends did not take their new husband’s name. Cheryl stayed a Cole for four years after splitting from footballer Ashley, and only changed to Versini-Fernandez when she remarried earlier this year . Some boyfriends I have had since my divorce have said they feel awkward about me still being called Hodgkinson and would prefer to think of me as Liz Garrett, untainted by carrying a long-ago ex’s name. And there could be an identity crisis if my ex decided to remarry. But I think I’m fairly safe there. Neville is 70 and took a lifelong vow of celibacy when he went to live in a spiritual retreat centre 20 years ago. The prospect of a school reunion where I will be surrounded by people who knew me only as Liz Garrett got me thinking. I had a go at a signature I have not used for 50 years and it felt as if I was using an alias; as if that person is not me any more. So, I have had to face up to it: Hodgkinson, not Garrett, will be engraved on my tombstone. Jemima, sensibly, is changing her surname while she is still young enough to do so.","When Liz Hodgkinson divorced she kept her name for practical reasons .

"Iker Casillas admitted Spain's golden age was over after they became the first reigning champions to be knocked out of the World Cup after just two matches.

Casillas, heavily criticised after . the Holland debacle and fortunate to keep his place, did himself no . favours with a double-handed fist at Sanchez's gentle free-kick and the . ball dropped to Aranguiz who controlled it and then toe-poked back past . the keeper to make it 2-0.

"A free school which has received more than £3million in Government funding has attracted just 11 new pupils this month, it has emerged. The Leeds Jewish Free School, in the Alwoodley area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, opened with just eight pupils in March and now has less children across two year groups than many secondary schools have in a single class. It has prompted teaching union officials to question why public money has been put into a scheme 'which is in such low demand' at a time when the city is facing a school places crisis. The Leeds Jewish Free School, in the Alwoodley area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, opened with just eight pupils in March and now has less children across two year groups than many secondary schools have in a single class . Patrick Murphy, the National Union of Teachers branch secretary in Leeds, said: 'It is not just that this is such an awful waste of public money - which I think it is because there is so little demand for it - but it's that this is taking place against the backdrop of a city which is having to work hard to find the resources to create new places and which is facing major shortages in the primary school sector which will work up to secondary schools over time.' However the school's headteacher Jeremy Dunford said there was a larger cohort of Jewish pupils in the primary school system and said the secondary school expected its numbers to increase 'significantly' over time. He said that starting any new school was challenging and claimed the free school should not be judged on whether it has achieved value for money over two years but over the next ten years. He also said that before the free school opened, parents were having to send their children to Manchester in order to receive a Jewish secondary education. He said this was 'unacceptable'. The Leeds Jewish Free School is situated on the same site as the Jewish Brodetsky Primary School, with Mr Dunford serving as head of both. The £3.1million expansion and refurbishment of the free school, which saw it fitted with state-of-the-art science labs, a food technology kitchen and a design and technology studio, was completed in March this year. However, the school's capacity is only for 25 pupils per year meaning it is already almost half full. The free school, which is situated on the same site but adjacent to Brodetsky Primary School, was given £3m in Government funding which it used to fit state-of-the-art science labs, a food tech kitchen and a design studio . Apart from its religious studies, all of the teaching at the school has been contracted out to another Leeds academy - Rodillian - which sends its teaching staff to the school to deliver subjects in double lessons. Mr Dunford said this model allowed the school to deliver a full curriculum. He also said that year groups at Brodetsky Primary were increasing in younger years and he anticipated attracting more pupils to the secondary free school in future. Currently around 60 per cent of the secondary school's pupils are Jewish. The Department of Education backed the school and said it was 'perfectly normal' for a new school to take time to establish itself. A spokesman said: 'Free Schools are a crucial part of our plans to help young people fulfil their potential and succeed in modern Britain. 'Once fully up and running, Leeds Jewish Free School will deliver 175 high quality secondary school places. 'It is perfectly normal for any type of new school to take time to fully establish itself and we fully expect pupil numbers to grow with the school over time.'","The Leeds Jewish Free School received £3.1million in Government funding .

"Wimbledon is where Boris Becker will earn his money. Novak Djokovic appointed Boris as his coach last December and how good a signing he has been remains to be seen. But I believe Boris was recruited with Wimbledon in mind. Novak will not want to lose to Andy Murray again, like he did in last year’s final. He looked like a deer in the headlights at times during that match, as if he was bewildered by the ferocity of the crowd support for Andy. Surely he knew what it would be like! I’m not saying he would’ve won it, but if Boris had been with him the night before you would’ve certainly seen a different, more prepared Novak out there. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Novak Djokovic: Wimbledon is 'home' for new coach Boris Becker' Eyes on the prize: Boris Becker celebrates beating Stefan Edberg to win Wimbledon in 1989 . At full stretch: Novak Djokovic was convincingly beaten by Andy Muirray during the final of Wimbledon 2013 . Dejected: Novak Djokovic reacts after losing to Andy Murray in straight sets at Wimbledon last year . Novak has won only one of the last nine Grand Slams so doubts will be beginning to creep in, even if he would never admit it. But if anyone can help him at Wimbledon, it’s Boris. When they walk through the gates together on Monday, Boris’s chest will be puffed out and his feathers fluffed. He won it three times, he was the king here and Novak will want some of Boris’s magic to rub off on him. This is what he was brought to the party for and that’s why I fancy Novak for the title, narrowly over Andy — I definitely think the winner will come from their semi-final. The big four are so closely matched and so good that they are constantly seeking out that microscopic edge. That’s what Andy is looking for in Amelie Mauresmo. It is certainly an interesting appointment. I don’t think she’s been brought in to change tactics, more to have someone there to listen and know what to say and what advice to impart the night before a biggie. Even the greats have doubts before semis or finals. I remember seeing that with my ex-wife Chris Evert. She had beaten her great rival Martina Navratilova in three sets in a late night semi-final at Wimbledon despite being a 20-1 underdog. She did all her off court media and we got back to our house in Kingston and the phone was ringing off the hook. She was ecstatic and spoke to everyone. I said: . ‘Great but in 24 hours you’re on for the final.’ Sure enough, the next . morning she was completely flat. If Billie Jean King had been there she . would have seen the signs and pulled her into line. As it was, Chris . lost to Evonne Goolagong Cawley. New approach: Andy Murray has turned to Amelie Mauresmo after parting with Ivan Lendl . Patience: Amelie Mauresmo will need time to help Andy Murray improve his game . One thing I detest on the women’s tour is the shrieking during games. It’s horrendous, absolutely awful and this was a product of people coaching it into them while they were young and now they can’t get out of it. You just don’t need to make those noises when you’re hitting the ball. It’s  off-putting for spectators, it’s off-putting for the opponent and I’m so glad the WTA are doing something about it. They can’t stop it for this generation but for the next it will be stopped. How they’re going to do it will be interesting, maybe they’ll have a gruntometer. But it has to be stopped. I’ve heard some of them practising and they don’t do it as loud then. After Lendl, I don’t think Murray could have been with anyone who wasn’t a Grand Slam winner. He has a lot of trust and respect for his best friend and hitting partner Dani Vallverdu but emotionally, Dani can’t tell him how he should feel the night before a Wimbledon final, whereas Amelie can. The only issue that could arise during rain delays is that women are not allowed in the men’s locker rooms. They’re both members at Wimbledon so should be able to find a room but it could be a problem at the US Open. I don’t think it would be a problem if women were allowed in the locker room anyway. Who gives a damn really? There are female physios in football teams who are allowed in the changing rooms. I also hope Amelie is given time. She’s only been there three weeks and he’s already failed to defend his Queen’s title so in effect she’s one down one to go. It can take a few months for a new coach to take effect so I hope she’s not seen as a failure if Murray doesn’t win Wimbledon. I listened to lay people questioning why he would appoint Amelie and there are still those sexist attitudes. If it doesn’t go well there’ll be a lot of people saying: ‘I told you so.’","Becker won three times at Wimbledon in 1985, 1986 and 1989 .

"It might look like a giant eye in the sky, or something from a science fiction fiction film, but in fact this incredible image reveals just how violent planet formation is. Captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, it shows the huge dusty debris discs around stars. Created by collisions between leftover objects from planet formation, were imaged around stars as young as 10 million years old and as mature as more than 1 billion years old in Nasa's images. Captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, this image shows the huge dusty debris discs around a star called HD 181327, showing a huge spray of debris possibly caused by the recent collision of two bodies into the outer part of the system. Irregularities observed in one ring-like system in particular, around a star called HD 181327, resemble a huge spray of debris possibly caused by the recent collision of two bodies into the outer part of the system. In those cases, collisions between planet-sized bodies cast debris that then coalesced into a companion moon. The suspected planet collision seen in the disk around HD 181327 may be similar to how the Earth-moon system formed. “It’s like looking back in time to see the kinds of destructive events that once routinely happened in our solar system after the planets formed,” said survey leader Glenn Schneider of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. The survey’s results appeared in the Oct. 1, 2014 issue of The Astronomical Journal. Once thought to be simply pancake-like structures, the unexpected diversity and complexity and varying distribution of dust among these debris systems strongly suggest the disks are gravitationally-affected by unseen exoplanets orbiting the star. Alternatively, these effects could result from the stars passing through interstellar space. The researchers discovered that no two ""disks"" of material surrounding stars look the same. “We find that the systems are not simply flat with uniform surfaces,” Schneider said. “These are actually pretty complicated three-dimensional debris systems, often with embedded smaller structures. 'Some of the substructures could be signposts of unseen planets."" The astronomers used Hubble’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to study 10 previously discovered circumstellar debris systems. Irregularities observed in one ring-like system in particular, around a star called HD 181327, resemble a huge spray of debris possibly caused by the recent collision of two bodies into the outer part of the system. . “This spray of material is fairly distant from its host star — roughly twice the distance that Pluto is from the sun,” said co-investigator Christopher Stark. “Catastrophically destroying an object that massive at such a large distance is difficult to explain, and it should be very rare. 'If we are in fact seeing the recent aftermath of a massive collision, the unseen planetary system may be quite chaotic.” Though astronomers have found nearly 4,000 exoplanet candidates since 1995, mostly by indirect detection methods, only about two dozen light-scattering, circumstellar debris systems have been imaged over that same time period. Over the past few years astronomers have found an incredible variety in the architecture of exoplanetary systems – planets are arranged in orbits that are markedly different than found in our solar system, . “We are now seeing a similar diversity in the architecture of the accompanying debris systems.” Schneider said. “How are the planets affecting the disks, and how are the disks affecting the planets? There is some sort of interdependence between a planet and the accompanying debris that might affect the evolution of these exoplanetary debris systems.” From this small sample, the most important message to take away is one of diversity, Schneider said. Though astronomers have found nearly 4,000 exoplanet candidates since 1995, mostly by indirect detection methods, only about two dozen light-scattering, circumstellar debris systems have been imaged over that same time period. That’s because the disks are typically 100,000 times fainter than, and often very close to, their bright parent stars. The majority have been seen because of Hubble’s ability to perform high-contrast imaging, in which the overwhelming light from the star is blocked to reveal the faint disk that surrounds the star. The new imaging survey also yields insight into how our solar system formed and evolved 4.6 billion years ago. In particular, .","Shows the huge dusty debris discs around stars created by collisions .

"Edinson Cavani sounded a warning to England to beware a Uruguay team on the rebound from their humbling by Costa Rica and with Luis Suarez back in their line-up. Suarez, who completed a full training session on Wednesday, is expected to start his first game since minor knee surgery a month ago, and could even return with the captain’s armband in the absence of the injured Diego Lugano. He will reform his formidable strike partnership with Cavani —  the £56million Paris Saint- Germain star who used the eve-of-game press conference at Sao Paulo’s Arena Corinthians to remind the world of the Uruguayan spirit. VIDEO Scroll down to see Luis Suarez on Uruguay's crunch clash with England . Warrior spirit: Edinson Cavani is still up for a battle . Big boost: Cavani and Luis Suarez are set to resume their partnership after the Liverpool striker came through full training on Wednesday . ‘Our message is always the same,’ said Cavani. ‘We are difficult to beat, we have strong character and strong personality and if you want to win against us you have to fight. ‘We have thought a lot about why we lost against Costa Rica. It was difficult to accept, not because we thought they were easy — we respected them — but we were playing well and we thought we would start the competition on the right foot. ‘Losing is never nice. We know we lost because we made mistakes. We have seen it, analysed it and we are convinced it was our fault. We have the tools to react. We are ready to face this  situation. We have overcome similar situations before.’ Uruguay’s experienced manager Oscar Tabarez projected a calm confidence in a team which has achieved considerable success. His players were semi-finalists in South Africa four years ago, they won the Copa America in 2011 and reached the last four in last year’s Confederations Cup. Not enough: Cavani's penalty couldn't stop Uruguay suffering a shock defeat to Costa Rica . They stumbled in the qualifying campaign for this tournament but few expected them to lose 3-1 to Costa Rica in their first Group D fixture on Saturday. ‘Motivation is always a personal process,’ said Tabarez. ‘I lead this team but they won’t achieve  anything if they don’t want it for themselves. We are a team always willing to fight and recover. ‘When you lose a game you have two choices: give in or keep united, react and recover. That’s what we’ve always done. ‘We are worried that we lost and started the World Cup with a defeat because this has an impact on our chances to go through, but this is not over yet. Dejected: The Uruguay players trudge off after being beaten by Costa Rica . ‘We have two games to play. Two teams will meet who both need to win. One will stay in and the other has very little chance to continue. We have to be convinced we will reach our aims. ‘We’ve had similar situations where we had negative results and we overcame the situation. It doesn’t mean we will make it but we know our team always fights until the end. My objective is to beat England and continue in the World Cup. If we win this game, we will be really strong.’ Uruguay will be without two of their usual back four. Lugano has a knee problem and Maxi Pereira is suspended, but Tabarez said he was not tempted to change tactics. Rolling the dice: Oscar Tabarez is ready to gamble on Suarez's fitness . Far more important will be the return of Suarez, Uruguay’s record goalscorer, and his physical  condition. ‘I have often played with Luis and we have done wonderful things together,’ said Cavani, who put in a light training stint. Tabarez, however, admits there is inevitable risk involved. ‘Luis has recovered well,’ said the 67-year-old manager. ‘His knee seems to have adapted to the  work he’s been doing. He’s been training and playing with his  team-mates during this last week. ‘So, he was able to train but we know a training session is not the same as a match. If he plays we must consider the possibility that he’s not as well as he was during the Premier League. All smiles: Suarez is expected to go straight into the side to face England . 'But, even when he is not 100 per cent, he is someone who can give a lot to his team. That’s what we’re considering right now. ‘Luis has always wanted to face all the challenges in his career. Not only playing for the national team but in other situations. Any time we have needed him in any sort of match he has been willing. He has always improved himself and his career is wonderful, brilliant. ‘He plays in one of best leagues in the world and has overcome many different problems. He is a very important player for us because of his technical abilities and his personality.’","Cavani set to resume formidable partnership with Luis Suarez .

"ON YOUR MARKS...One week to go before the hold button is pressed on normal life. Seven days of dreams and expectation followed by a month of ecstasy, agony, and the tricky job of fitting in three games a day round sleeping and eating and doing the occasional bit of work. So here are ten reasons why the 2014 World Cup could be the best, yet. Well – Brazil (the place), obviously . The land of coffee, smiley beautiful people and samba football. It would be hard to pick a more glamorous host nation. No kid grows up wanting to play for Germany (unless you’re German, of course). Every kid (even Germans) wants to be Pele. Tricks and flicks are copyright Brazilian, after all. The stage is set: Two Rio icons, the Christ the Redeemer statue and the Maracana Stadium, venue for the World Cup final on July 13 . Finishing touches: A sand sculpture marks the start of the World Cup on Copacabana Beach in Rio . Up for grabs: The famous World Cup trophy next to the adidas Brazuca ball on the pitch at the Maracana . Neymar . With all the furore over the Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo rivalry, it has been easy to overlook the Brazilian with the dodgy haircut, who has had an up-and-down season at Barcelona. Only now he is back home, a stage on which he has tended to excel. The signs are that Brazil will play a pragmatic game. Big Phil Scolari is not a flamboyant manager. But Neymar has a box of tricks at his disposal and the tendency to do his own thing. Should be fun to watch. Back home: Brazil's Neymar is predicted to be the star of the World Cup . Shine a light: The Barcelona star is a stylish Brazilian player in a pragmatic team led by Luis Felipe Scolari . Messi v Ronaldo . Difficult to ignore but the constant comparison of Real Madrid’s Portugeezer Ronaldo and Barcelona’s Leo is beginning to wear a little thin. The common perception is that Messi has had a disappointing season when the truth is that he has not had a stand-out one. Narcissist Ronaldo has a Champions League medal and will be looking for as many reasons as possible to rip off his shirt and display his six pack to the world. He does know he will get booked, doesn’t he? Star turn: Lionel Messi knows it's time to perform on the greatest stage for Argentina . Put your shirt on him: We're bound to see more of Cristiano Ronaldo's six pack during the World Cup . No vuvuzelas and no England band . An over-riding memory of South Africa four years ago was the loud (ok, deafening) sound of a million angry hornets courtesy of the vuvuzela. FIFA decided that this year’s official ‘noise maker’ would be a caxirola – for sale at all good World Cup outlets. There is just one flaw. The caxirola has been banned from all 12 stadiums because it doubles up as an aerodynamic missile. Still, it’s not all bad news because the ban on anything musical means the England brass band is silenced for the first time since France 1998. Silenced: We will at least be spared the infernal racket of the vuvuzela out in Brazil . Not today, thank you: The England band will be absent from the tournament after the ban on musical instruments . Roy Hodgson . I know. England coaches tend not to be flavour of the month during big tournaments but Hodgson has brought reality to the whole crazy national expectation. He talks sense, does not give a damn how he is portrayed in the media and it looks like he has convinced the players too. Lest we forget, this is a man who was drummed out of Merseyside because he was not regarded as ‘big enough’ for Liverpool and, supposedly, the players. The Anfield mob with England seem fine with him. Unfazed: Roy Hodgson leads England into the World Cup with expectations pretty low . The 3 Cs – Copacabana, Caipirinha, Coxinha . Bare-footed boys playing football on the sand, watched by bikini-clad beauties. It can mean only one thing – welcome to the Copacabana. Here’s a prediction...we’ll be seeing a lot of the most famous stretch of beach in the world over the next month. Here’s another prediction, just like Pimm’s at Wimbledon, England’s hostelries are likely to be offering the deadly caipirinha – a cocktail with a sting in the tail. To those lucky enough to be out there, coxinha - a deep-fried chicken and cheese delight – is the equivalent of your meat and potato pie. Brazilian dream: A local player perfects his bicycle kicks on the soft sand of Copacabana Beach in Rio . Golden days: A game of football in progress on Ipanema Beach in Rio, with the silhouette of Sugar Loaf mountain in the background . Gary Lineker . No stranger to our screens at World Cup time but the Match of the Day host’s wonderfully laconic style tends to set the tone for the rest of the BBC team. He’s been there and done it as a player and he’s been there and done it as presenter. As an added bonus, he will be tweeting too. Laconic: Gary Lineker will be fronting the BBC's coverage of the World Cup . No wags . It might be two World Cups ago now, but the image of Baden-Baden is not yet erased from the memory banks. Footballers’ wives do nothing for a football tournament other than act as magnets for paparazzi. Taking the missus/mister to work tends not to go down that well in most jobs and that’s what the England team are doing, after all. Never again: England WAGs out and about in Baden Baden, Germany during the 2006 World Cup . Pele . Three-time winner, four-time finalist, the greatest player to grace the game. And the World Cup will be in his manor, which means lots of excuses to show nostalgia clips of the ‘old days’. Pele in his pomp will be a reminder to the new generation just how high he set the bar. Legend: We'll hopefully be seeing plenty of Pele when the tournament kicks off in Brazil . Steven Gerrard . World Cups are all about fairytales and no-one deserves a happy ending like the England and Liverpool skipper. This is likely to be his last tournament and only the coming weeks will show whether the effort – mental and physical – of last season will prove too much for the midfielder. But whatever happens to England, let’s hope Stevie G flies home with his head held high. Captain, leader...

"It's been overlooked for decades, but now scientists believe infrared energy could turn out to be a major contributor to warming in the Arctic region. Infrared is invisible to human eyes but accounts for about half the energy emitted by Earth's surface. This process balances out incoming solar energy. However, researchers hadn't previously thought to consider the long-wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Now, they believe its inclusion could change existing climate models. This simulation shows averaged radiative surface temperature changes during the 2030s after far-infrared surface energy was taken into account. The right colour bar depicts temperature change in Kelvin . Earth's surface is thought to radiate the equivalent of 17 per cent of incoming solar energy as thermal infrared. Despite its importance in the planet's energy budget, it's difficult to measure a surface's effectiveness in emitting far-infrared energy. As a result, its influence on the planet's climate is not well represented in climate models, which assume that all surfaces are 100 per cent efficient in emitting far-infrared energy. That's not the case. The scientists found that open oceans are much less efficient than sea ice when it comes to emitting in the far-infrared region of the spectrum. It's been overlooked for decades, but now scientists believe infrared energy could turn out to be a major contributor to warming in the Arctic region (pictured) This means that the Arctic Ocean traps much of the energy in far-infrared radiation - a previously unknown phenomenon that is likely contributing to the warming of the polar climate. 'Far-infrared surface emissivity is an unexplored topic, but it deserves more attention,' said Daniel Feldman, a scientist in Berkeley Lab's Earth Sciences Division. 'Our research found that non-frozen surfaces are poor emitters compared to frozen surfaces. This discrepancy has a much bigger impact on the polar climate than today's models indicate. Professor Feldman's simulations revealed that far-infrared surface emissions have the biggest impact on the climates of arid high-latitude and high-altitude regions. Dr Jason Box tweeted this provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic . The planet is 'f**cked' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor. This is according to Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He said: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane - which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. The leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. 'We're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario, and we need to get off it,' Dr Box told Brian Merchant at Motherboard . 'We're f**ked at a certain point, right? It just becomes unmanageable. The climate dragon is being poked, and eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place.' In the Arctic, the simulations found that open oceans hold more far-infrared energy than sea ice, resulting in warmer oceans, melting sea ice, and a 2°C increase in the polar climate after only a 25-year run. This could help explain why polar warming is most pronounced during the three-month winter when there is no sun. It also complements a process in which darker oceans absorb more solar energy than sea ice. 'The Earth continues to emit energy in the far infrared during the polar winter,' Professor Feldman said. Arctic sea ice hit its annual minimum on 17 September  2014. The red line in this image shows the 1981-2010 average minimum extent. Scientists believe the latest study will require existing climate models to be changed . 'And because ocean surfaces trap this energy, the system is warmer throughout the year as opposed to only when the sun is out.' The simulations revealed a similar warming effect on the Tibetan plateau, where there was five per cent less snowpack after a 25-year run. This means more non-frozen surface area to trap far-infrared energy, which further contributes to warming in the region. 'We found that in very arid areas, the extent to which the surface emits far-infrared energy really matters,' said Professor Feldman. 'It controls the thermal energy budget for the entire region, so we need to measure and model it better.'","Infrared energy accounts for half the energy emitted by Earth's surface .
But it's difficult to measure a surface's effectiveness in emitting infrared .
Its influence on planet's climate is not well represented in climate models .
Now scientists claim open oceans are less efficient at emitting infrared .
The discovery could change existing climate models, researchers claim ."
"Liverpool remain hopeful that Luis Suarez will stay at Anfield at the start of the season despite the rumblings of intent emanating from Spain. Barcelona and Real Madrid will both make bids for Suarez this summer but so far none have been received. Liverpool have enquired about the availability of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona, who the Catalans are willing to sell, but a part-exchange deal involving Suarez has yet to be discussed. VIDEO Scroll down to see a Luis Suarez look-a-like working as an air steward . Targeted: Luis Suarez is a transfer target of Real Madrid and Barcelona . Delight: The Uruguayan celebrating his vital winning goal against England last Thursday . Barcelona media believe that Uruguay striker Suarez has taken the decision to leave Liverpool this summer and the comments he made following Thursday's defeat of England have given them and Real Madrid encouragement. However, Liverpool have yet to receive any such indication. Although a figure of £82million has been mentioned, Suarez and his camp say there is no release clause in his latest contract and that indicates it will all be down to how much money either club throw at the project. Madrid have long been considered favourites but they have a side issue with Karim Benzema's contract talks that could yet have a bearing on the speed of their move for Suarez.

Stumbling block: Real Madrid's talks with their forward Karim Benzema could hinder their move for Suarez . VIDEO Suarez family say he should leave Liverpool .

They are selling Alvaro Morata, and are willing to listen to offers for Angel di Maria, Sami Khedira and Fabio Coentrao. All have been linked with Liverpool but di Maria and Khedira, particularly, may have more relevance to Chelsea if Madrid continue to push for Carlo Ancelotti favourite Ramires.

"While coaches speak of the value of experience at a World Cup, it is inevitably the lesser heard-of young players who provide some of every tournament’s stand-out moments. Roy Hodgson has made the effort to inject his squad with young talent to spring a surprise on England’s opponents, but across the competition other countries are doing the same with not-so-big names looking to make an impact. So looking ahead, here’s 10 players you might not have heard of who can light up the World Cup: . VIDEO Scroll down to see England's young star Barkley holding up the England team bus . Stars: Roy Hodgson has injected youth into a new-look England... but here are 10 other youngsters . Christian Atsu (Ghana) One of Chelsea’s legion of loanees at Dutch outfit Vitesse, 22-year-old Atsu picked up the fans’ Player of the Year award at his temporary home and could win more admirers in Brazil with his trickery both down the wing and in a more central role. Despite only making his international debut two years ago, Atsu has quickly built up 21 caps for his country and will want to use the world stage to impress Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho. He has been dubbed the ‘African Messi’ by Ghanaians and even if they struggle in a tough group with Germany, Portugal and USA as rivals, Atsu should get opportunities to show off his pace on the counter. Time to shine: Chelsea fans will be eager to watch Christian Atsu in action for Ghana this summer . Bernard (Brazil) Last year’s Confederations Cup gave enough of a preview of Bernard’s talents to have a host of top clubs tailing him before he ended up at Shakhtar Donetsk for a fee of around £20million. Despite a tough season in Ukraine, with problems on and off the field, the 21-year-old made it into Luiz Felipe Scolari’s on the back of his past electric cameos for the World Cup hosts. Coming off the bench, Bernard will be expected both to take advantage of space when Brazil are leading games and to help break down sides when the host nation are chasing with his intelligent play which will be key to changing the flow of games. Hopes of a nation: Bernard is the youngest player in hosts Brazil's squad for the World Cup . Sofiane Feghouli (Algeria) Algeria will be far from favourites in Brazil but having convinced talented right-sided attacking midfielder Feghouli to choose to play for them rather than France adds an impressive string to their bow. With his blistering pace and dribbling skills, Feghouli will be one to watch in Group H and has an eye for goal, as shown against Sevilla in the Europa League semi-finals and in the five goals he already has for his country. Feghouli has criticised for his inconsistency and was subbed off on his only appearance on British soil against Swansea but the World Cup should bring out the best of him in a well-balanced side. Star man: In Algeria team lacking world class talent, Valencia's Sofiane Feghouli is the one to watch . Julian Green (United States) Having only changed nationality after playing for a series of German youth sides in March, Green has just two caps for the US under Jurgen Klinsmann. The 19-year-old made his debut for Pep Guardiola’s Bayern Munich and his impressed to an extent that Tottenham have identified him as a target to add some bite to Mauricio Pochettino’s new look midfield. Having made it into the US roster ahead of Landon Donovan the pressure is on Green, who is likely to be utilised as an impact substitute where his pace will trouble tiring defenders. Pressure: Julian Green, featuring only for Bayern Munich's second team, replaced Landon Donavon for USA . Mateo Kovacic (Croatia) All the fuss about Croatia’s midfield pre-tournament has been about creative sparks Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic, so much so that their 20-year-old crucial cog in midfield has almost been ignored. Interest from Manchester United and Liverpool brought his name into the public eye and despite a difficult start to the season, Kovacic has been quietly improving in a struggling Inter Milan side. His combination of tidy passing and strong tackling in midfield is likely to draw more admirers this summer, both from Premier League managers and those watching on at home. Ignored: Mateo Kovacic will line up alongside Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic for Croatia against Brazil . Divock Origi (Belgium) Origi is one of only two out-and-out strikers for Belgium alongside Romelu Lukaku and having been nurtured as Lille’s new ‘prince’ after the departure of Eden Hazard. Just 19 years old, Origi has the potential to be the complete package: matching his height with agility, trickery and a powerful shot. His pace stretches defences while his frame leaves markers constantly occupied. He offers the Red Devils another dimension to their play and although his talent is still very raw, he is the kind of player that often thrives in the spotlight that only a World Cup can provide. Goalscorer: Divock Origi had a fine season in France, and will now be looking to shine for Belgium in Brazil . James Rodriguez (Colombia) It seems strange that a £36million player could go under the radar but Monaco’s lack of European football meant that Rodriguez slightly avoided the spotlight this year. The 22-year-old pulls the strings in midfield for club and country and his impressive turn of pace will get fans in Brazil off their seats – provided he gets space now that injured team-mate Radamel Falcao won’t be the centre of the defenders’ attention. The pressure is on Columbia’s primary creative force in Falcao’s absence but if he can handle that and match his performances that put him into the Ligue 1 team of the season, Rodriguez’s drive could help guide his country through the latter stages. Splashed the cash: £36m Monaco star James Rodriguez pulls the strings for Colombia in midfield . Ricardo Rodriguez (Switzerland) Switzerland’s place as a top seed in the World Cup draw was ridiculed but their young players will be on a mission in Brazil to prove that seeding right – with Rodriguez keen to keep up their typically strong defensive record. The left back helped Wolfsburg to a fifth place finish in the Bundesliga and is one of that rare breed that fans tend to love: a full back with an eye for goal. Rodriguez is a free-kick specialist and finished the season with five league goals coupled with nine assists and will be looking for his first goal on the international stage this summer. Solid: Ricardo Rodriguez has impressed at left-back for Switzerland and Wolfsburg despite his young age . Son Heung-min (South Korea) South Korea’s squad is full of young players but Son is the brightest star after four seasons in the Bundesliga at the age of just 21. Blessed with two good feet and great pace, the Bayer Leverkusen midfielder has the skillset to be a danger to any of the sides in Group H. He has been criticised for taking too many shots – but that should prove entertaining on the big stage and if he can convert a couple of those efforts South Korea could cause upsets. Talented: Son Heung-Min's dribbling skills from midfield make him South Korea's main attacking threat . Georginio Wijnaldum (Holland) For years Wijnaldum was flagged up by Football Manager devotees as one to watch, but his entire career so far has been spent in the Dutch Eredivisie with Feyenoord and more recently PSG. The 23-year-old prefers to play as a central playmaker but might find competition fierce there with Wesley Sneijder still running the show in midfield – and instead could be left to cut in from out wide or to make an impact from the bench. Injury absence this season should leave him fresh to impress at the World Cup and the PSV captain will be keen to show off the silky skills that had Brendan Rodgers interested earlier this year. Hard work: Blessed as a teenager, Georginio Wijnaldum has finally lived up to his early promise for the Netherlands .","Julian Green, Divock Origi and Georginio Wijnaldum make the list .

"An unknown law graduate has been picked as the lead vocalist for a charity song that will be the soundtrack for the tear-jerker Christmas TV ad from Waitrose. The supermarket’s commercial is a shift from its normal festive marketing campaign which in the past has been fronted by the Michelin star celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal. This weekend will see a raft of high street stores launch their Christmas TV commercials using a mix of celebrity and schmaltz in order to capture a share of family festive spending. Scroll down for video . The Waitrose Christmas ad will be aired this Sunday and features a relatively unknown law graduate as the soloist, as well as 10-year-old Blaise Allen and employee Jummy Sanusi in place of the usual cast of celebrities . Relatively unknown law graduate Beth Pennell (left) has been chosen as lead vocalist for this year's Waitrose Christmas advert. The supermarket has switched from using celebrities, such as Heston Blumenthal (right) Beth Pennell, aged 23, from Chester was one of thousands of people who donated their voice to be used in the Waitrose soundtrack, which is a version of the Dolly Parton hit ‘Try’. She was astonished to discover that the producer of the song David Kosten, who has worked with some of the world’s biggest stars, including Chris Martin of Coldplay, wanted to use her as the lead vocalist. The song, which is effectively created from a national choir of amateurs, will be released as a charity single raising money for Age UK, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity and The Trussell Trust, which supports food banks. Waitrose has taken the lead from the successful Christmas commercials of its parent company John Lewis by creating a short story designed to appeal to the emotions. It tells the story of a girl, portrayed by Blaise Allan, aged 10, from Kent, who struggles to make gingerbread biscuits for a fund-raising school fayre. After several failures, she is helped by a Waitrose employee, 25-year-old Jummy Sanusi, who lives in Ilford and works at the chain’s branch in Canary Wharf. The commercial delivers a happy ending with a successful stall at the school event, while the little girl goes back to see Jummy with a thank you gift of a gingerbread biscuit. The Waitrose advert this year replaces its usual cast of celebrities with staff and 10-year-old Blaise Allan, Kent . The Christmas advert follows the story of Blaise who struggles to make a gingerbread man for school . After several setbacks Blaise asks a Waitrose employee for help and successfully makes her gingerbread . Beth, who graduated with a first in law from Liverpool John Moore’s university, has recently got a job with a law firm in Chester and views singing as a hobby she enjoys rather than a career. ‘I used to sing in High School, but haven't done much since then. I'm mainly a shower singer,’ she said. ‘I recently got given some time in a recording studio as a birthday present by my mum and have put together several songs on a soundcloud page, but it was very much just for fun, rather than a view to making a career in music. ‘I know that working in the music industry full time is very difficult and demanding. I see my singing as something I enjoy as a hobby.’ Beth along with thousands of others donated their voice to be used in the commercial by downloading their singing to a special website set up by the supermarket. She added: ‘It seemed to me to be a good way of contributing to a good cause and it didn’t involve running a marathon. The Waitrose Christmas advert is due to air during the commercial break of X Factor this Sunday evening . Jummy Sanusi (right) a Waitrose employee, stars in the ad, which has a charity single as a backing track . Waitrose appears to have switched from using celebrities to front its Christmas advert for this year . I assumed I would be just one of the voices among the crowd. It never occurred to me that my voice would be picked out.’ The full 90 second ad will air at 8.15pm on Sunday in the X Factor break with a 10 second introduction from the poet Roger McGough to thank the public for donating their singing for charity. It will be repeated at 9.15pm during Downton Abbey, and again at at 9.30pm during Homeland on Channel 4. The song will go on sale via download immediately through iTunes and Google Play with all profits going to the three charities. Dolly Parton, who gave a stand-out performance at this year’s Glastonbury Festival, released ‘Try’ in the summer and she has used it as the theme for her own campaigning work on improving literacy. The song does not have a Christmas theme, however the lyrics talk about striving to overcome difficulties in life. Describing the song, she said: ‘It's about saying you've just gotta get out there and try. It's an uplifting encouraging song. You're not going to amount to anything unless you try.’ Rupert Thomas, Waitrose Marketing Director, said: ‘Because our Partners own the business, they are motivated to go that little bit further for customers - and that’s what we want to portray in this advert. ‘The extra dimension of the soundtrack means customers can also give something back. When they donated their voice, they also had a chance to support three worthy charities who will be receiving the profits from the song when it goes on sale as the ad airs.’","Waitrose has switched from using celebrities in this year's Christmas advert .

"Google has been ordered to pay compensation to a woman in Montreal, Canada, after a judge ruled that the tech giant had invaded her privacy. Maria Pia Grillo had claimed she suffered shock and embarrassment after she was searching for her home on Google Map’s Street View in 2009 and discovered that the image they’d used featured her sitting outside the property with ‘part of her breast exposed.’ The photo had been taken by one of Google’s camera-equipped cars and even though they blurred Grillo’s face, she argued that the picture provided enough information for her to be easily identified. The offending photo of Grillo that appeared on Google Street View and the blurred replacement were compiled in this graphic by local French language newspaper Le Journal de Montreal . Grillo started legal proceedings against Google in 2011 to ‘blur’ the rest of her, as well as her license plate and address, reports Le Journal de Montreal. She also demanded that the company pay her $45,000 for emotional damage, including depression and mockery from her co-workers. Google eventually agreed to blur out more of the image, but rejected her claims for compensation on the grounds that she was in a public place and that her subsequent emotional troubles weren’t connected . A Montreal judge rejected Google’s ‘public place’ defense and said people do not forfeit their privacy rights simply by being in a location where others can see them. However he did not agree that there was a direct connection with Grillo’s mental condition. Google was ordered to pay her $2,250 plus interest and an additional $159 in court costs.","The image on Google Map's Street View featured Maria Pia Grillo and 'part of her breast exposed'

"A disabled pensioner has hit out at British Gas after the energy giant phoned him, visited him and sent him bills for 14 years - even though he doesn't use any gas. Stroke victim Alan Eacock, 73, says the firm repeatedly pestered him over a gas meter he does not use - and has now had removed -  leaving him suffering from stress. British Gas have finally apologised for his treatment - but have risked making matters worse by promising to contact him yet again to say sorry. Stroke victim Alan Eacock, 73, says he has suffered 14 years of pestering from British Gas - despite the fact that he gets his electricity from Npower and even cut off his gas supply in a bid to end the bills and calls . Mr Eacock says he started receiving bills from the company soon after he moved into his flat in Kings Norton, Birmingham over 10 years ago. He says he has since been contacted 'thousands' of times by the firm, despite repeatedly telling them he was not using any gas. Following numerous visits by engineers but a continued barrage of mail and calls, he disconnected his gas meter. But even that did not stop the company and he has continued to be contacted, with his most recent letter arriving in August, demanding £30.73. Other bills however say Mr Eacock needs to pay £0.00 to the company. Mr Eacock, who suffered a stroke 17 years ago, says he now wants to sue the energy giant for the stress caused. Mr Eacock say he wants compensation from the company for his treatment . 'I hate them. It's been an absolute nightmare. I have never used gas in the property. I have electric heaters and an electric oven,' he said. 'I even got the gas meter disconnected, but still British Gas keep sending me letters.' The company referred demands for money to a debt collection agency, Improved Financial Solutions Ltd, at one point. Mr Eacock, who gets his electricity from Npower, added: 'It is driving me mad. I am a strong-willed person, but it could easily send somebody else over the edge. 'Every time I see a new letter in the post I get really stressed, and often rip them up. I just want it to stop. 'I have had 14 years of hassle, phone calls and sitting in waiting for their visits. I just can't take it any more.' British Gas say Mr Eacock was charged a £25 standing charge from 2013 because he had a meter, even though he was not using any gas, in line with Ofgem rules. Because these bills were unpaid, they were referred to a debt collection agency. They insist he was contacted less than 10 times about this issue. The company did however admit that Mr Eacock should not have received any bills after had his meter removed in April. A spokesman said: 'When Mr Eacock contacted us earlier this year to ask for his meter to be removed, we should have closed his account straight away. 'Customers who do not use gas or electricity and have meter in their can ask for this to be done free of charge so they do not have to pay the standing charge. 'We should have done this immediately, given his circumstances, to resolve the issue. Mr Eacock's account is now closed and will not receive any more letters from us. We have contacted him to apologise and to offer a gesture of goodwill.' The company has finally apologised to Mr Eacock and says it will 'contact him' to say sorry.

"Craig Spencer, the doctor whose confirmed Ebola diagnosis sent New York City into a tailspin on Thursday, successfully cleared the U.S. government's newest 'enhanced' screening protocols when he returned from Africa. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Dr Spencer, who was in Guinea treating Ebola patients as part of a Doctors Without Borders team, passed inspection six days before showing symptoms and being rushed to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. 'The healthcare worker had returned through JFK Airport on October 17 and participated in the enhanced screening for all returning travelers from these countries' affected by the virus, the CDC said in a statement. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Outrage: The CDC admitted on Thursday that its latest screening program missed the latest US Ebola patient . Hot-blooded? Arriving international passengers at JFK Airport who have been in an Ebola hot-zone country now have their temperatures taken and answer some health questions before being cleared to enter the U.S. Dr Craig Spencer, fresh from work in Guinea with the aid group Doctors Without Borders, was diagnosed with Ebola in New York City on Thursday – despite successfully navigating the CDC's 'enhanced screening' protocol at JFK Airport . 'He went through multiple layers of screening and did not have a fever or other symptoms of illness.' The CDC's acknowledgement brought angry catcalls on Twitter on Thursday night, as Americans realized Ebola could reach the US despite security upgrades introduced following an earlier case of Ebola arriving from Africa. 'Well then,' read one post, 'it appears your 'advanced screening' is a load of bull***t. Another failure by CDC.' The agency moved quickly to try to quell online concerns, but the effort met with little success. Spencer 'didn't have fever or other symptoms of illness during screening; reported fever to health officials for 1st time today,' the CDC tweeted. 'So basically,' came a tweeted retort, 'screen[ing] process doesn't work to detect Ebola carriers ... Sheesh.' The CDC announced on Thursday that New York airline passengers who began their journeys in Liberia, Sierra Leone, or Guinea and arrive at JFK or Newark Liberty Airport will soon be subject to 'post-arrival monitoring' by state and local health departments for 21 days. That policy, however, isn't slated to go into effect until October 27. With an incubation period of 21 days – some health authorities put it yesterday at 42 days – Ebola has proved a tricky pathogen to spot in patients who don't suffer from fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or other symptoms. Dr Craig Spencer rode the subway along with visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley, The Gutter, and the High Line park. It was revealed today that he had also eaten at The Meatball Shop in Greenwich Village and stopped at Blue Bottle Coffee on the High Line on Tuesday . As more cases are identified that slip through the CDC's screening system, the chorus of demands for banning travel to the U.S. from affected countries will grow louder. The agency has been under fire since the first U.S. Ebola diagnosis was made on September 30. That patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, died on October 8 after contracting the virus in Liberia and returning to Dallas, Texas. CDC Director Thomas Frieden insisted early on that the risk of additional transmitted cases was low, although two nurses who treated Duncan fell ill with the disease. One, Amber Vinson, was permitted to fly from Texas to Ohio and back despite having a mild fever. Public panic after her case was publicized forced the closure of schools, shops and university offices in Ohio. September 16: Dr Craig Spencer flew to Guinea to treat Ebola patients as a member of the French organization Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontiers). October 14: Dr Spencer departed Guinea on a flight to Brussels. He reported no symptoms. October 17: He boarded a flight to the U.S. on Brussels Airlines Flight SN0501. Reported no symptoms. Arrived at JFK and was screened with no symptoms upon arrival. October 21: At 7 AM, he reported fatigue and exhaustion. No fever, vomiting, diarrhea. At around 3:00 PM, Dr Spencer visited The Meatball Shop for 40 minutes. The Meatball Shop is located at 64 Greenwich Avenue. Around 4:30 PM, he visited the High Line. Walked on High Line and stopped at the Blue Bottle Coffee stand (10th Ave & W 16th St) At around 5:30 PM, he got off the High Line at 34th Street and took the 1 train to the 145th Street station. October 22: At around 1:00 PM, Dr Spencer went running along Riverside Drive and Westside Highway. Around 2:00 PM, he went to pick up Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm share at 143rd St and Amsterdam Avenue (Corbin Hill Farm) and picked up a box which he took to his apartment. At around 5:30 PM, Dr Spencer left for The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with two friends. For his arrival at Gutter, he took the A train at 145th Street and transferred at 14th Street and took the L train to Bedford Avenue. Around 8:30 PM, Dr Spencer left The Gutter. For his return trip, he used Uber as his means of transportation. October 23: Around 10:15AM, he first reported a fever. At this point, he called Medecins Sans Frontieres and the New York City Health Department. He was immediately taken to Bellevue by FDNY EMS. How did it happen? Dr Spencer was pictured in full hazmat gear as he prepared to travel to Guinea - he could have contracted the disease in his off-hours while mingling with Guinean civilians . Critics say the CDC's screening is meaningless since it can't identify Ebola carriers who are incubating the disease and have not yet shown symptoms . Americans have lost confidence in the CDC's ability to contain Ebola, according to an Associated Press-GfK Poll released Thursday. Most disapprove of President Obama's handling of the outbreak, and just 1 in 5 say the CDC has handled the disease well so far. Only 3 in 10 trust public health officials to share complete and accurate information about the virus. Eighteen percent have 'deep confidence' that their own local hospitals could safely treat a patient with Ebola. 'Americans are worried about ... the steps we are taking to contain Ebola,' California Rep. Darrell Issa said Friday morning on Capitol Hill. Issa was speaking at the beginning of a hearing convened by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which he chairs. Nina Pham: The 26-year-old Texas Health nurse, was declared Ebola-free on Friday at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. She will now return to Texas with her family and be reunited with her dog Bentley. She thanked doctors, family and the country for their 'prayers, hope and love' during her recovery. Her dog Bentley was declared Ebola-free earlier this week . Amber Vinson: The 29-year-old colleague of Miss Pham was given the all-clear on Wednesday from the virus. She was being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia . Ashoka Mukpo: The NBC cameraman, 33, was given the all-clear on Tuesday at Nebraska Medical Center after being diagnosed with Ebola last month. He said that his greatest fear about dying from Ebola was leaving behind his beloved fiancee. Unidentified man: An Ebola patient who was being treated at Emory since early September was released earlier this week.  The man was released Sunday from Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, after he was determined to be free of the virus and no threat to the public. WHO disclosed that a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone had been evacuated out of Africa when he tested positive for the disease. Thomas Eric Duncan: The Liberian man, 42, was the first case of Ebola to be diagnosed on U.S. soil. He was hospitalized on September 28 after initially being sent home from Texas Presbyterian Hospital. He died on October 8. Dr Rick Sacra: The doctor who has spent a great deal of the last two decades as a missionary in Africa, contracted Ebola while treating Ebola patients. Dr Sacra, from Massachusetts was declared disease-free and released on September 25 after weeks of treatment at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital . Nancy Writebol: The missionary worker contracted Ebola in July and was flown from Liberia to Emory in Atlanta. She recovered several weeks later and was declared disease-free although has said she is still working to rebuild her strength. Dr Kent Brantly: The doctor contracted Ebola around the same time as his colleague, Nancy Writebol. Both he and Mrs Writebol received the experimental serum Z-Mapp. He was also declared Ebola free and has given multiple blood and plasma donations to help subsequent Ebola patients. Dr Craig Spencer: The 33-year-old Doctors without Borders volunteer is the first person to be diagnosed in New York City. The engaged medic is currently being monitored in Bellevue Hospital after being rushed from his Harlem home on Thursday night. His fiancee Morgan Dixon and two friends are being monitored after their contact with him. His treatment to date has been undisclosed and his condition is said to be stable .","Dr. Craig Spencer returned from Guinea on October 17 .

"The image of the dole queue, most famously captured in the hit film The Full Monty, is to be consigned to history with an overhaul of jobcentres. Thousands of digital signing pads are being installed across the country to make it easier to claim out of work benefits. Ministers claim the 'digital revolution' will help more people back into work, tearing up the paper booklets needed to sign on with every visit. The jobcentre queue become an iconic moment in the Full Monty film, as the jobless steel workers-turned strippers practised their moves to the sound of Donna Summer's Hot Stuff . The scene in the 1997 film The Full Monty, when the six steel workers-turned strippers dance to Donna Summer's Hot Stuff, has been voted the funniest movie moment ever. While waiting to sign on they find themselves practising their moves to the sound of the music playing in the jobcentre. It became so famous that Prince Charles recreated it on a visit to Sheffield in 1998. Now the government is tearing out the counters and installing more computers so jobseekers do not have to queue up. Job cards, scanned by the unemployed in search of suitable vacancies, are also being binned. Esther McVey MP, the Minister for Employment, said: 'Every day, Jobcentres across the country are helping people into work, contributing to record falls in unemployment. 'But as the economy grows and the jobs market changes, so are Jobcentres. Long gone are the Full Monty days of job cards in the windows and queuing for your dole. 'We're seeing record employment levels – and with this digital revolution, the government is doing even more to help people into work.' Employment minister Esther McVey insisted the changes would make it easier for people to find work . The Department for Work and Pensions said new specially-designed computers will bring all jobcentre services into one device. They are to be installed at more than 700 sites to make it easier for people to find work. And 23,000 electronic signing pads will be fitted across the country, making it easier to sign on, and saving more than £1m a year. It is claimed the move will cut fraud and make the jobseeking process paperless. Free wi-fi will also be offered at all jobcentres, along with 6,000 digital jobsearch computers across Britain. Officials say more than £2million every year will be saved as a result of the removal of the standalone jobpoints after more than two decades. Last week official figures revealed biggest fall in unemployment since records began, as more than half a million people found a job in a year. The number of people in work has reached a record 30.7 million, as the jobless total tumbled to its lowest level for eight years. It was the first time the number of people unemployed has fallen below 2million since the autumn of 2008, in the wake of financial crash. In September the number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance also fell, down 18,600, to 951,900 - the 23rd consecutive monthly reduction.","New computers and technology to replace job cards and dole books .

"Four years after the mysterious shooting death of his mistress, former Mobile County, Alabama Commissioner Stephen Nodine, 51, is a free man. Nodine was released from jail Monday morning, two years after  pleading guilty to a perjury charge in exchange for prosecutors dropping their murder case against him in the death of girlfriend Angel Downs, 45. The disgraced public official held a press conference Monday afternoon, where he took partial responsibility for Downs' death while continuing to insist he's not a murderer. 'My actions were wrong,' said Nodine. 'I should not have carried on an affair. This was my moral fault and I take full responsibility for the things that I've done.' Scroll down for video . Freed: Former Mobile County, Alabama Commissioner Stephen Nodine (left) was released from prison on Monday after pleading guilty to charges surrounding the 2010 shooting death of his mistress Angel Downs (right) Making up for lost time: Nodine spent his first day of freedom bonding with his 18-year-old son Christoper (the two pictured hugging on his release, above) 'I think about [Angel] every day of my life. I know my actions contributed to her death, unfortunately, and I have to take responsibility for that.' But Downs' family is still not buying Nodine's story, and issued a statement of their own on his release Monday morning. 'Our family still believes 100 per cent that Stephen Nodine murdered Angel,' Downs' sister Susan Bloodworth said. 'While we may not see justice for Angel here on earth, we know that justice will be served in the end, by God!' Suspicion: Downs' family issued a statement on Nodine's release on Monday, saying they still believe he's guilty of her murder. 'Our family still believes 100  per cent that Stephen Nodine murdered Angel,' her sister Susan Bloodworth wrote . Nodine was the primary suspect in Downs' death when she was found shot in the head in the driveway of her Gulf Shores home on May 9, 2010. He was initially charged with Downs' murder, but that trial ended in a hung jury in December 2010 when experts testified that Downs could have been murdered or committed suicide. On the eve of his retrial in 2012, Nodine struck a deal with prosecutors, agreeing to plead guilty to a perjury charge in exchange for the murder and stalking case being dropped.  The perjury charge stemmed from his attempt to get a public defender, when he could afford to pay his own attorney. He entered jail shortly after he was sentenced in October 2012. Overall, Nodine served two years of the 10-year sentence on the perjury charge. Nodine also served time for harassment and an ethics violation related to use of his county-owned car. Another year was served for owning two guns while taking illegal drugs. He says one of the most beneficial parts of jail time was that it helped him get sober. Nodine was released from Bay Minette jail shortly before 7am and he spent his first day of freedom bonding with his 18-year-old son Christopher. Father and son reunited: Nodine's son Christopher was just 14 years old when he was first arrested in connection to Downs' murder. He says he regretted not getting to teach his son how to drive, or see his recent high school graduation . Christopher was just 14 when his father was initially arrested for Downs' murder and Nodine says he regrets not being around to teach his son to drive and see him graduate from high school. 'He's never wavered,' Nodine told AL.com. 'Some kids might have gone in a different direction.' He talked little of Christopher's mother, who divorced him after Downs was found death. He called her a 'super person'. On Monday, the father and son went golfing and Nodine got the opportunity to eat 'real food for the first time in a long time' when he chowed down on a black-and-blue burger. Nodine also took the time to pray at  the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception for everyone he 'hurt' including Downs' family. Nodine will remain on federal and state probation for the next three years. He plans to stay in the Mobile-Baldwin area, and is working on a book about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. 'I have to find a job,' said Nodine. 'I hope people realize that people make mistakes in their lives and have forgiveness as I forgive those who wrongfully prosecuted me.'","Former Mobile County Commissioner Stephen Nodine was considered a suspect when his mistress Angel Downs was found shot to death in 2010 .

"Wayne Rooney is under pressure and facing the biggest challenge of his 93-cap England career. There are four attacking positions in Roy Hodgson’s team and it is beyond dispute that Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling are now automatic names. Rooney had that security once but he is now vying with Ross Barkley, Adam Lallana, Danny Welbeck and James Milner for the other two spots. Time to perform: Wayne Rooney must produce a good display in England's second World Cup game against Uruguay to remind us of his class . Night of frustration: Though Rooney set up England's goal, scored by Daniel Sturridge, he struggled to contain Italy's Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva . Headscratcher: Roy Hodgson must decide whether to keep Rooney in his left-sided position against Uruguay on Thursday . Playing him wide left against Italy — something I advocated 10 days ago — has increased the debate about his place in the starting line-up after he had problems containing the excellent combinations Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva. In the months building up to the World Cup, Hodgson was urged to be bold in his selection and that is exactly what he was. It is why the majority are still upbeat even though Group D began with a defeat in Manaus that has left no margin for error. Criticism of Rooney came from the fact he looked lost defensively but, when you have a striker operating in that area, those are the risks associated with being more adventurous; that he ventured into the space left by Darmian to create Sturridge’s goal showed the benefits of playing him there. Hodgson could have gone for a more solid line-up and played Milner but what would the reaction have been? Same old cautious Roy. Rooney, who should have equalised in the second-half, was put in the role so England had players coming from deep to cause Italy more problems and the system was also designed to stop the control that Andrea Pirlo would have on the game. No longer automatic: Rooney faces competition from a number of players for his place in the England team . Competition: Raheem Sterling occupied a central position against Italy in order to more effectively link up with striker Daniel Sturridge . Better form: Sturridge continued his scoring streak this season when he converted Rooney's cross on 37 minutes . Sterling did the first bit brilliantly with a performance that showed he has come of age but the peerless Pirlo — and the outstanding Daniele De Rossi — could not be stopped pulling the strings with their remarkable pass completion statistics; both were more than 90 per cent. England’s problem on the left was more with Leighton Baines than Rooney. A full-back can see the whole picture but they were both caught in between positions too often; Baines should have ordered Wayne to tuck in and stop the supply to Candreva. The other option would have been for Wayne to stick close to Darmian and Baines could have pushed on to Candreva. Defensive duties: Rooney attempts to block a cross by the impressive Antonio Candreva but Italy held the upper hand on that flank for much of the match . Tormented: Antonio Candreva caused endless problems for Leighton Baines in the England left-back position . This culminated in the winning goal when Baines was caught between pressing Darmian or staying  with Candreva. He did neither and England paid the ultimate price. The communication from Baines should have been better. Uruguay, however, do not have a  playmaker like Pirlo and that means Wayne can take a more central role on Thursday. People will say ‘why should we accommodate him?’ when Sterling was so impressive in that role against Italy. I just feel with Uruguay’s defence in disarray after the defeat to Costa Rica, Sterling could terrorise whoever plays at right-back in the absence of the suspended Maximiliano Pereira and Wayne could wreak havoc in the middle. Midfield masters: England captain Steven Gerrard congratulates Italy's Andrea Pirlo after the match . Return? Luis Suarez is likely to be in the Uruguay team when they face England on Thursday after recovering from a knee injury . Another persuasive factor for Rooney to start is the fact he offers goals. He has yet to break his duck at a World Cup finals but, even so, he has got 39 for England and when he sets foot on to a pitch he will firmly believe he can score at this level. Taking him out of the team would dilute England’s threat and it has to  be remembered the combined international tally of Welbeck, Lallana,  Milner and Barkley stands at nine — and Welbeck has eight of those. Would any of them have the same belief as Rooney? No player should be included on the back of past glories and it is clear that Barkley and Lallana are breathing down his neck. But until he plays in his favoured central role, firm judgements about Rooney should be reserved. Replacement: Adam Lallana could come in for Rooney if Hodgson decides to drop him for the next match . In contention: Ross Barkley could start against Uruguay after coming off the bench in the Italy match . If we do not get that performance in his favoured position it may be time to make changes but, right now, the time has come for Rooney to deliver. He needs a performance to remind us why he was an automatic selection for so long.","Wayne Rooney faces the biggest test of his 93-cap England career .

"A Friday night curry may be many people's idea of food heaven, but it's the traditional Sunday roast that has come out on top in a new survey of Britain's favourite meals. Roast dinner was named as the ultimate comfort food by 43 per cent of those questioned, beating steak and chips, scones with jam and clotted cream and apple crumble into second, third and fourth place. And chicken tikka masala, long cited by many as one of the country's most popular dishes came in at number 14, having been beaten by pizza, lasagne and spaghetti Bolognaise. Scroll down for video . Pub favourite: Roast dinner has named as the ultimate comfort food by 43 per cent of those questioned in a poll of more than 10,000 people to mark the 25th anniversary of BBC Good Food . Chocolate brownies, strawberry cheesecake and victoria sponge were also among the list of favourites, according to the Independent on Sunday. The survey into Britain's eating habits was carried out to mark the 25th anniversary of BBC Good Food. More than 10,000 people were questioned on their favourites, with traditional British dishes often coming out on top. Some 50 per cent of those questioned by YouGov said a traditional roast was the dish they cooked at least once a month, beating spaghetti Bolognese at 49 per cent and curry at 43 per cent. Currying favour: Chicken tikka masala, long cited by many as one of the country's most popular dishes came in at number 14, having been beaten by pizza, lasagne and spaghetti Bolognaise . And despite not being able to walk down a high street without passing several coffee shops, the Great British cup of tea still holds a place in the hearts of many. Some 41 per cent declared it to be their breakfast drink of choice, putting the beverage far ahead of coffee, which was favoured by 29 per cent of those quizzed. However, when it comes to a takeaway fish and chips was beaten into second place by a Chinese meal, which 53 per cent of people said they preferred. The survey also showed that while almost half of Britons still eat together as a household every day, at least two-thirds of them are watching at least one screen and a fifth are in front of two or more screens. Time for tea: Despite not being able to walk down a high street without passing several coffee shops, the Great British cup of tea still holds a place in the hearts of many . Around half of people said they could confidently cook ten or more dishes from scratch but a full 10 per cent of the population say the cannot cook a thing - including 16 per cent of men. The study also revealed that the horsemeat scandal appears to have had little impact on buying and eating habits. Although 42 per cent said the scandal has made them pay more attention to where meat comes from, fewer than one in ten, 9 per cent, are eating less because they are worried about the quality. Some 15 per cent are now eating less meat than a year ago in an effort to spend less money on food, while 65 per cent said they only sometimes, rarely or never visited their local high street food shops, with 40 per cent of them citing cost. The microwave is the kitchen item most Britons cannot live without (56 per cent), beating kitchen knives (51 per cent) and a toaster (47 per cent). TV dinner: While almost half of Britons still eat together as a household every day, at least two-thirds of them are watching at least one screen . BBC Good Food editor Gillian Carter said: 'The impact of the horsemeat scandal has meant that people are more concerned about where meat is coming from. However it is interesting to note that more people are cutting back on meat consumption due to concerns about cost rather than the scandal. 'Butchers also don't seem to be benefiting to any great extent. The vast majority of respondents only sometimes, rarely or never visit high street shops, with the perceived cost again being the most common reason. 'What is of concern is that five million respondents say they are unable to cook a single recipe. We know that cooking is a feel-good activity, with large numbers of respondents saying they felt happy, comforted or inspired when cooking, so the more we can encourage people to cook, the better.' Chef Tom Kerridge said he hoped to see more men master the basics in the kitchen. 'We can see that overall the nation's cooking ability is good, but there seems to be a group who haven't ever learned the basics, including a disproportionate number of men,' he said. 'Cooking needn't be a big chore and is something everyone can learn the basics of and enjoy.'","Roast dinner named as the ultimate comfort food in survey of 10,000 people .

"A motorist has escaped a horror crash after his car plunged 50ft down a cliff – and he and his passenger walked away unharmed. Kris Newton, 34, was driving his father’s Subaru Impreza in Walker, Newcastle, with a friend at around 10am yesterday when he accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brakes.

He said: ‘I've been driving since I was 25, and I've not had a serious crash. ‘We went through the fence and the next thing I knew I was down the bottom climbing out. ‘It all happened so quickly. ‘I've no idea what happened.’ An onlooker who witnessed the crash at Shepherd Offshore on Wincomblee Road said: ‘I saw the two lads getting out and scampering away. ‘The car was still smoking.

"Two care workers who 'abused, degraded and mocked' mentally-ill patients 'for their own amusement' while another took photos on her mobile phone have been jailed. William Bowman, 22, and Chevonne Benson, 23, subjected their victims - many who suffer from dementia - to systematic abuse including hair pulling, name calling and cruel pranks, while Claire Strong, 21, took pictures of the humiliating incidents. The offences at Bupa-run Beacon Edge Nursing Home in Penrith, Cumbria, took place between January and September last year. William Bowman (left) and Chevonne Benson (right) abused patients in their care while another carer, Claire Strong, took photos on her mobile phone. All three have now been jailed for ill-treatment of a person without capacity . The mistreatment only emerged when a female carer started work at the home and resigned, appalled at some of the events she witnessed, after just one shift. The whistle-blower's concerns were passed to management before social services and the police became involved, Carlisle Crown Court heard. Bowman, from Bowscar, near Penrith, was jailed for three-and-a-half years today after he admitted eight counts of ill-treatment of a person without a capacity and was convicted earlier this week of sexually assaulting a resident at the care home. Benson, from Penrith, was sentenced to three years after she pleaded guilty to 10 counts of ill-treatment of a person without capacity. Strong, of Clifton, was jailed for one year after she admitted three counts of ill-treatment of a person without capacity. Detective Constable Carolyn Willacy, who led the investigation, said: 'The level of ill-treatment towards residents by these three was so shocking that a member of staff resigned after working only one shift. 'She was left distraught by what she saw but displayed great courage and decency by speaking out. 'All of the residents involved in this case suffered some form of mental illness, most from dementia. Their lack of understanding and inability to report the abuse made them an easy target. 'Bowman and Benson abused, degraded, and mocked those people who were under their care. Their vile acts would be recorded by Strong on her mobile phone. They subjected their victims to torment, including hair pulling and verbal abuse which left them visibly distressed.' The horrific abuse took place at the Bupa-run Beacon Edge Nursing Home in Penrith, Cumbria . In a joint statement issued through police, the families of the victims said: 'Due to their illnesses, we do not know how the victims, our loved ones, feel about what happened to them, but we do our best to speak on their behalf. 'The investigation and court case have been extremely distressing for us all and we do not take any pleasure in the outcome. 'There are lessons to be learnt from this case and we hope all involved will work together towards preventing anything like this happening again.' They thanked the woman who spoke out and exposed the abuse. Senior prosecutor Isla Chilton said: 'The three defendants physically, verbally and emotionally abused vulnerable men and women for their own amusement. William Bowman also further degraded one of the residents by sexually assaulting her. 'The victims were lovingly placed in the care of the residential home by their families. It is a place where they should have been looked after and all their needs met. 'However these three employees abused the trust placed in them by their employers and the victim's families by their demeaning treatment of them. 'It is due to the willingness of the witnesses in coming forward which brought an end to the abuse and has enabled us to bring these defendants to justice for their abhorrent actions.'","William Bowman and Chevonne Benson humiliated mentally-ill patients .

"Louis van Gaal has told Rene Meulensteen his services will not be required at Manchester United next season. Meulensteen was previously employed by United under Sir Alex Ferguson and enjoyed great success at the club before he left following the appointment of David Moyes last summer. Since then the Dutch coach has had two short and troubled spells as a manager at Anzhi Makhachkala in Russia and Fulham in the Premier League. Comeback: Rene Meulensteen has expressed a desire to return to Manchester United next season . Rejected: But new United boss Louis van Gaal will bring his own staff to Old Trafford . Meulensteen has been out of work since his departure from Fulham in February but he has revealed a desire to return to Old Trafford to work under countryman Van Gaal. However, the Holland boss has rejected that plan and will bring his own coaches to United. 'I would have been keen to go back,' Meulensteen said at the release of the LMA Annual Castrol European Managers and Coaches Survey. Partnership: Meulensteen assisted Sir Alex Ferguson during a period of great success at United . 'I spent 12 years at what is a fantastic club and never left Man United because I fell out with anyone there. 'But they've chosen to appoint Louis van Gaal and he has decided to bring in his own people so that is not an option. 'Have I spoken to Van Gaal? Yes, I know that is the case - it has been confirmed to me.' He added: 'It is disappointing. When you spend 12 years at a club the size of Manchester United, working in every department - not least for five years with the first team which were the most successful in the history of the club - of course you are disappointed. No 2: Ryan Giggs will be Van Gaal's assistant at Old Trafford next season . 'There aren't many coaches who have spent so much time with one club as I have.' Meulensteen remains keen to try his hand at management again despite bad experiences last season. 'I am definitely keen to get back into it,' he said. 'I've had an experience not many coaches have had because I worked in a very professional environment at United with a lot of stability and then the last 12 months have been the complete opposite. 'But it hasn't put me off at all, it only makes me stronger and more aware.'","Former Manchester United assistant told his services will not be needed .

"An urban fox crept into a family home in South London and attacked a two-year-old boy. File photo . A family told of their horror yesterday after a fox crept into their home through a catflap and attacked their young son. The two-year-old boy screamed in pain as the animal bit his heel, drawing blood. His startled parents ran upstairs after being alerted by the cries and found the fox sitting at the end of the child's bed. The animal then darted into another room and hid under a bed before running out of the house in New Addington, south London. The parents, who did not wish to be named, took the toddler to Croydon University Hospital, where he was put on a course of antibiotics. Yesterday the child's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, 46, said the boy has been left with two bite marks on his heel. She said: 'When I heard, my whole body went like jelly. I could not move. You think if they did not hear the fox, then it could have run off with him.' Mrs Vaizey, a care worker who has four children and nine grandchildren, said she had heard about fox attacks, but never dreamed it would happen to her family. 'When it is this close to home, it is so frightening,' she added; 'But he is fine. He is a tough little boy.' She added: 'He is the sort of boy that falls over all the time and has a laugh about it afterwards. 'But I just think it is so lucky they were still up at the time. ' She said the family had now put a panel over the catflap to prevent the fox coming back after the incident at 2am on October 30. She added: 'My daughter wanted to kill the fox. She said she never had a problem with them before, but now she hates them. 'She said this one looked really healthy and that he looked well-fed, so you do worry.' In June 2010, nine-month-old twins Lola and Isabella Koupparis were mauled by a fox that entered their home in Hackney, east London. Lola received facial and arm injuries, while her sister received arm injuries. The boy's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, said she had heard about fox attacks but never dreamed it would happen to a member of her family . In February last year, a fox got into the bedroom of a one-month-old baby in Bromley and bit the child's finger off. Urban wildlife expert John Bryant said yesterday: 'Attacks like this are extremely rare and it involved the heel. 'There have been cases where people have been lying on sunbeds in their garden and have woken up to find a fox nibbling their toes. 'The fox is obviously investigating. It is very common for foxes to come in through catflaps. 'It is always wise to keep the cat in and shut the catflap at night. It is another incident, but fortunately minor.' The attack - which left the boy needing hospital treatment - happened in New Addington, south London last month .","Family shocked to hear two-year-old cry out in his sleep late last month .

"Evelyn Grace Campbell (pictured) was sentenced to two years in prison for escaping jail . A woman has been sentenced for up to two years in prison for escaping prison by impersonating another inmate. Evelyn Grace Campbell, 29, from Uniontown, Pennsylvania, fooled jail guards and a bail bondsman at Fayette County prison into believing she was another prisoner with a similar sounding name. She left the prison and the mix-up wasn't noticed until the next day. Campbell - who was serving a six month sentence for retail theft - signed herself out of the prison on June 6 when a bondsman showed up to post $500 bail on behalf of another inmate, Maretta Gambel. The warden says Campbell stepped forward when guards called for Gambel. She then escaped after telling the bail bondsman she didn't have identification before he let her sign the release papers. Warden Brian Miller said the guards and bail bondsman should have had photos of both women. Campbell left the prison and the mistake was not noticed until 7am the next morning. She turned herself in at 3pm the same day. Campbell - who was serving a six month sentence for retail theft - escaped Fayette County Prison (pictured) She was charged with forgery and identify theft and had a new $30,000 bail set. On Wednesday, she was sentenced to a maximum of two years in prison. Police said Campbell is not 'dangerous' but 'elusive' and has a history of running from police.","Evelyn Grace Campbell, 29, has been sentenced to two years in prison .

"Despite being just five years old - Hannah Higgins has displayed more bravery in the face of adversity than most adults will in a lifetime. The young girl, who had cancer, sent a deeply moving message to other sick children - telling them: 'If you have cancer don't worry - I am brave and you can be brave also.' With the help of her father Joshua, the amazing young girl recorded a video talking people through her illness and the ordeal she has been through. Scroll down for video . Moving: Five-year-old Hannah Higgins sends a reassuring message to other children suffering from cancer . But instead of appearing downcast in the two-minute Youtube clip, Hannah talks about her tumours, her treatment and the effect they have had on her with an astounding level of maturity. She was diagnosed with bilateral Wilms' tumor, a form of kidney cancer, in February 2014 and treated at Rady Childrens Hospital in San Diego. She then underwent six months of chemotherapy, had radiation treatment to her lungs and has had four bouts of surgery to remove her left kidney and part of her right kidney. In the video she describes the tumour that was removed as a 'big meatball on her kidney'. She adds: 'Chemo has medicine to kill the cells that are growing the tumour and the medicine keeps going to try and kill it. 'This also damages the cells which grow my hair so all my hair fell out. 'I had something called radiation also, which is pretty fun because you get to blow bubbles and I can bring my CD and sing along. 'And you have these butterfly stickers they draw on you with permanent marker. 'Cancer is no fun but its a little bit fun because you get to go on this camp.' Towards the end of the heartrending clip she explains that she is making the video to help others deal with cancer. She says: 'I want to be on TV and I want to be on the newspaper so people can see how brave I've been during cancer. 'If you have cancer don't worry - I am brave and you can be brave also.' Hannah finished her treatment on August 25 and has been told that there are no more signs of the disease. Her mother Kristen said: 'Hannah is doing well, she finished her treatment and her end of treatment scans showed no evidence of disease. 'She will be regularly monitored by MRI and CT for the next five years. She started kindergarten this fall and is doing great!' Below the YouTube post, her father Joshua wrote: 'Throughout her ordeal, she has always been very matter a fact about the entire situation. 'She understands what's going on and knows what's needed to fix it. 'She approached us one day and said she wanted to do a ""commercial"" to explain to other kids what they can expect when going through cancer and show them ""how brave"" she has been. #teamhannah' The YouTube video has already been viewed by thousands of people with many praising Hannah for her bravery on Twitter. One user, Lorena Loana, tweeted: 'So much bravery and hope in a little soul! Really motivating and emotional.' Another wrote: 'This adorable five-year-old wanted to make her own commercial. So she did. She's brave and I love her.' Joshua is encouraging those moved by Hannah's message to donate to either Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation or St. Baldrick's Foundation. Both charities focus on research - an area in children's cancer fundraising that is sometimes under-funded.","Hannah Higgins, of San Diego, diagnosed with kidney cancer in February .

"Ever wanted to own a Transformer? Thanks to a Japanese company, that dream is not far away. Called 'J-deite quarter', a project to create a working quarter-scale machine that can change from a car into a robot has been completed. Now the team have released images and video of the transformation process in full flow - with even larger versions set to follow in future. Scroll down for video . Japan's robot creators Wataru Yoshizaki (right) of Asratec and Kenji Ishida of Brave Robotics, display the transformable robot 'J-Deite quarter', which can change its shape of a robot to a vehicle at the annual Digital Content Expo in Tokyo on 23 October 2014 . The prototype robot was created by a collaboration involving Brave Robotics, Asratec and Takara Tommy. Scheduled to be completed by 2020, the current robot is 4.3ft (1.3 metres) tall - but it will eventually be 16.4ft (five metres) high. Back in August a real-life Transformer was created by scientists at the Harvard's Wyss Institute, inspired by the Japanese paper-folding art of origami. In tests, the small shape-changing robot (pictured) folded itself into a functional machine that could walk and turn without human help. But unlike the popular Transformers toys - robots that disguise themselves as cars and trucks - the device is not aimed at children but rather for other applications like search and rescue operations. Their next goal will be to create a half-scale model, 8.2ft (2.5 metres) tall, due by 2016. The robot, which weighs 77lbs (35kg), was unveiled at the annual Digital Content Expo in Tokyo on 23 October 2014. It can walk on two legs at a speed of 0.62mph (1km/h), but when it changes to ‘car mode’ however, it can reach speeds of 6.2mph (10 km/h). In the video it is seen moving its head, lifting its arms and of course changing into car mode - all in a matter of seconds. However, when in robot mode it seems to prefer an awkward waddle, rather than walking in full stride like a real Transformer. It is powered by something called ‘V-Sido OS’, software designed by creator Wataru Yoshizaki to allow anyone to control humanoid robots. The team doesn’t have plans to release the robot to the public, instead only building it as a prototype. But fans of Transformers will surely be looking forward to the finished model.

"Julian Dicks has returned to West Ham after agreeing a deal to take over the management of the club's women's side. The 45-year-old enjoyed two lengthy spells at Upton Park during his playing career but also hit out at current boss Sam Allardyce when the Hammers were going through a difficult spell at the turn of the year. Dicks has previous managerial experience with Wivenhoe Town and Grays Athletic, and revealed on Twitter he had accepted the job to take charge of the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division outfit.

"Giant Japanese hornets attacked runners during an annual race at Highclere Castle, location of the fictional home of Lord Grantham in Downton Abbey. Some 300 racers ran through the grounds of the picturesque Berkshire estate when the invasive insects swarmed over them. Dozens of runners were injured after they were stung by the pests who had crossed the English Channel from the continent. Scroll down for video . Runners involved in a race through the grounds of Highclare Castle - home to Downton Abbey were attacked . Halfway through the run, the participants disturbed a large group of Japanese hornets in the undergrowth . Runners were taking part in the annual run through the grounds of the fictional home of Downton Abbey . One runner collapsed after five miles when dozens of the insects were disturbed in the undergrowth and stung him repeatedly. The victim was treated by medics at the scene before being taken to hospital in a car. Even the real Lord Grantham, Highclere Castle's owner Lord Carnarvon braved the menace along the six-mile course. Race director Derek Matthews said the race was going well until they reached the halfway stage: 'Hundreds of angry hornets, threatened by the approach of the runners, mounted unrelenting, vicious attacks on the main field . The runners had no idea that the hornets were waiting in the undergrowth. 'All was quiet when we marked, checked and cleared the course. 'We don't hold Highclere estate responsible in any way - it was an act of nature and it could happen to anyone out in the countryside. 'This year’s fine summer has increased wasp and hornet activity, and ramblers, cyclists and joggers should be aware if they venture into the countryside, and give these insects a wide berth.' The 'real' Lord Grantham, Lord Carnarvon, pictured, was among the 300 people who took part in the run . John Gundill, Highclere estate's manager, said race organisers had checked the course beforehand and were not aware of any issues. He said: 'It's a hazrd in the countryside at this time of year,' adding that the race had been run without problems for several years. The Japanese hornet grows to 5cm in length and has a 6mm sting filled with venom . A single hornet can kill 40 honey bees in a minute . The carnivore hornets dismember the unfortunate bees even eating their honey. A swarm of just 30 hornets can destroy a hive of 30,000 bees in just three hours . Highclere is visisted by thousands of Downton Abbey fans every year but Mr Gundill reassured them that the race was not run on any of the public footpaths through the grounds. The race was won by Gareth Watkins of the Hillingdon Athletic Club in a record time of 34 minutes 43 seconds. At least six people have been killed by the hornets in France. The insects can grow up to 5cm in length have can brandish a 6mm sting. It is believed the hornets first arrived in France from the Far East in a consignment pottery in 2004. The English Channel protected Britain from the menace but they managed to cross the 20-mile waterway earlier this year. Parliament was warned about the impending invasion in April by the Environmental Audit Committee: 'The Asian Hornet, which might soon arrive here, has killed six people in France.'","Thousands of Japanese Hornets attacked running around 'Downton Abbey'

"You might think that when it comes to optical illusions, that you’ve seen them all. But a contest celebrating the ingenuity and creativity of the world’s best illusion research community has revealed its top three new visual tricks and how they fool your brain. The winner of the Illusion of the Year contest is an animated take on an old classic called the Ebbinghaus illusion, which tries to convince viewers that all the circles are growing and shrinking. Don't believe your eyes! The winner of the Illusion of the Year . contest is an animated take on an old classic called the Ebbinghaus, . which tries to convince viewers that the central circle is growing and shrinking. It was created by Christopher Blair, Gideon Caplovitz, and Ryan Mruczek of the University of Nevada Reno . The animated illusion plays with how our brains gauge an object’s size based on the objects that surround it. A central circle, which stays the same size, appears to change size when it is surrounded by a set of circles that repeatedly expand and shrink. The effect is particularly strong if you look away from the central circle or move your eyes – at least twice as effective as the classic, static Ebbinghaus illusion, the animation's creators said. The original illusion, which is also known as Titchener circles, was discovered by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus at the end of the 19th century but was popularised in a textbook about experimental psychology written by Edward B. Tichener in 1901. Research suggests that the relative size of perception is what makes the illusion work, including the distance of the surrounding circles from the central circle and the completeness of the annulus. Regardless of relative size, if the surrounding circles are closer to the central circle, the central circle appears larger and if the surrounding circles are far away, the central circle appears smaller. The Ebbinghaus illusion has played a role in the debate over the existence of separate pathways in the brain for perception and action. It has been argued that the Ebbinghaus illusion distorts perception of size, but not action, proven by a study where people had to 'grasp' the central circle and the scaling of their grip was unaffected by the perceived size distortion. The Neural Correlate Society's annual contest saw entrants from across the world submitting their best optical illusions. A panel of judges picked the top 10 and then attendees of the competitions at St Pete Beach in Florida decided the winners. The overall winner was the ‘Dynamic Ebbinghaus’ by researchers at the University of Nevada Reno, which plays with how our brains gauge an object’s size based on the objects that surround it. A central circle, which stays the same size, appears to change size when it is surrounded by a set of circles that repeatedly expand and shrink. The effect is particularly strong if you look away from the central circle or move your eyes – at least twice as effective as the classic, static Ebbinghaus illusion which has been popular for over a century, the researchers said. An international team from the University . of Leuven in Belgium, the University of California, San Diego and . Radboud University Nijmegen, in the Netherlands took second place for . their colourful illusions. A single coloured image can seemingly transform into several different colour patterns, depending on the . position of black outlines that are presented on top of the image. ‘The . shape of a surface depends more on changes of luminance [a measure of light intensity] in the visual . scene than on colours themselves,’ the team explained. Road trippy: Scientists from Rice University, Houston in Texas took third place with a black-and-white illusion of roads which appear to bend differently depending on where they are placed. Kimberley Orsten and James Pomerantz came up with the visual trickery . ‘By presenting black outlines on top of coloured images, the whole area between outlines is seen as having one single colour. ‘Instead of . seeing the actual colours presented at each location, our brain prefers . to see one homogenous colour, as surfaces in real life are usually also . perceived with one single colour.’ Scientists . from Rice University, Houston in Texas took third place with a . black-and-white illusion of roads that appear to bend differently . depending on where they are placed. Colourful confusion: The reason why the colours seem to change . because of the positioning of black lines is that our brain prefers to . see one homogenous . colour instead of the actual colours in precise locations, as surfaces . in real life are usually perceived in one . single colour . Images that are physically the same usually look the same, but in this illusion, two images that are different look the same – called metamers – and two images that are identical look different – called anti-metamers. ‘Our main illusion mixes the two: ‘It shows three images, two of which match with a third one mismatching. ‘Viewers see one image as odd, but it’s one of the two identical images they see as different, an illusion we call false pop out,’ they explained.","The winner of the Illusion of the Year contest, held in St Pete Beach, Florida, is an animated take on an old classic - the Ebbinghaus illusion .

"This is the first World Cup David Beckham hasn’t been directly involved in for more than 20 years, yet the crowning glory of a lifetime’s work will be felt in the Amazon on Sunday night when the whole of America stops to see how Team USA perform against Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal. Make no mistake, America is going ‘soccer-crazy’. Not in an underground kind of way, but mainstream crazy, with millions following every kick and Hollywood celebrities tweeting about the hottest show in town. There will be tens of thousands of USA fans in Manaus — 90,000 World Cup tickets were sold in America for this tournament, more than in any other country bar hosts Brazil — and more than 20million viewers are expected to  tune in.

Pointing the way: Paul Dalglish believes Beckham's legacy is now being seen in the US . It’s an extraordinary coming of age for football in the States, helped by the insatiable patriotism that America taps into whenever one of their teams or personalities do well, as they did in beating Ghana 2-1 in their opening match. But none of it would have been possible without our greatest English export. Beckham has galvanised interest since he shocked the world by leaving Real Madrid for Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. Four years ago, Beckham was in the England dug-out alongside Fabio Capello, having played in the three previous World Cups. For Paul Dalglish, son of Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny and someone who has been in America for eight years as a player, coach and manager, Beckham has created a monster in terms of public interest. ‘I wouldn’t say soccer has grown at grassroots level too much because it was already the most popular participant sport ahead of baseball and basketball, even when I arrived in 2006 to play for Houston,’ he said. ‘The big game-changer in terms of its growth as a professional sport was when Beckham arrived in 2007. ‘He is more than a soccer player, he is an icon; a franchise in himself. The MLS league here had only 12 teams when he arrived — next year there will be 21. He was a catalyst in making the sport mainstream and getting people to spend more money to watch soccer.’ The myth of the USA being inward-looking, whose sports teams call themselves world champions without leaving North America, has been shattered. Basketball superstar LeBron James gave his 13m Twitter followers a blow-by- blow commentary of the USA’s first game, posting immediately after Clint Dempsey’s 30-second opening goal against Ghana: ‘Now, that’s how you start a game!’ American dream start: Clint Dempsey celebrates his quickfire opener after catching Ghana cold . Justin Timberlake is an avowed fan and even the White House shared the joy after John Brooks headed USA’s winning goal against Ghana. ‘Congrats! Great start at the World Cup,’ they tweeted.Interest in Sunday’s game has not been topped, even when America hosted the World Cup in 1994. The first four pages of the New York Times were dedicated to soccer last week and Jurgen Klinsmann’s decision to leave out the country’s most famous player, Landon Donovan, caused almost as much hysteria as Glenn Hoddle did when he jettisoned Paul Gascoigne in 1998. ‘The backlash was intense but what it did was put a lot more attention on the national team,’ said Dalglish. ‘The one name everyone is familiar with, even by those who don’t follow the game closely, is Donovan. He’s the greatest footballer the States has ever produced.’ Disbelief: John Brooks celebrates his late headed winner for the Americans . Jumping for joy: Dempsey hit the heights after giving the United States the lead in Natal . Fortunately for the Germans, beating Ghana has lifted the pressure, although expectations are now sky-high for the Portugal game. USA probably need a result to qualify, with Germany lying in wait for their final group game. Despite knee problems, Ronaldo is capable of beating any team but midfielder Kyle Beckerman, who plays for MLS side Real Salt Lake where Dalglish is assistant-coach, says USA are ready. ‘We’ve watched Portugal closely, even their warm-up games against Ireland and Mexico,’ he said. ‘There are guys like Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey who realise that while we were ecstatic to beat Ghana, we have to come down from the cloud and get ourselves ready, because one win isn’t enough. ‘Everyone knows about Cristiano and we know he’ll be motivated after the first game (Germany won 4-0).’ As for the support, he added: ‘It is special. There was just a buzz around the stadium against Ghana. It’s caught us off guard that so many Americans are here. It was really emotional during the national anthem.’ Dalglish has only to take a straw poll of one to realise soccer is really taking off. ‘My wife is American but she doesn’t take too much interest in soccer generally or the MLS, even though it’s my job. But she won’t be missing Sunday’s World Cup game for anything.’ Ronaldo will be centre-stage but the excitement would not have been created without Beckham. ‘Ronaldo and Messi are well known in America as footballers but nowhere like the same level of fame as Beckham. He was on billboards, he was on Ellen (a chat-show for A-list celebrities),’ said Dalglish. ‘When he arrived, he literally sold out stadiums because people wanted to see him play. ‘He may be retired but you can see at this World Cup, the impact he had lives on.’","Son of former Liverpool boss, Kenny, now coaches in the MLS and says Beckham has sent popularity of football soaring since his move to LA Galaxy in 2007 .

"More and more players seem to be swapping shirts early at half time, but Iran captain Javad Nekounam got a step ahead of his team-mates: by appearing to ask Lionel Messi for his shirt at the traditional pre-match handshake. The 33-year-old Kuwait midfielder saw the opportunity to get hold of one of the most in demand shirts of the World Cup and looks to have popped the question to the Argentine superstar minutes before kick off in Belo Horizonte. A number of players have been spotted swapping shirts at half time in Brazil - but Nekounam set a new record by potentially nabbing Messi's shirt after the coin toss in what will most likely be Iran's biggest game of the World Cup.

"Cristiano Ronaldo has once again trained for Portugal ahead of their Group G clash with USA on Sunday - despite being warned that he risks his career by playing on at the World Cup. The 29-year-old Real Madrid forward has been struggling with a knee injury and doctors have told him that he could shorten his career by playing for Portugal in the short-term.

"A huge blast has ripped through an Iranian explosives factory linked to to the country's controversial nuclear programme - killing two workers and shattering windows nine miles away. The incident took place at Iran's Parchin military site, which is located around 19 miles southeast of the capital Tehran, the official IRNA news agency reported today. The pro-reform website, Sahamnews, said the explosion yesterday evening was so intense that the glare from the blast could be seen from miles away. Scroll down for video . The site of the explosion, Parchin military base, is situated 19 miles southeast of Tehran. The UN's nuclear watchdog has long suspected that the complex was used in the development of a nuclear weapons capability . The semi-official Iranian Students News Agency (Isna) said the fire was in an 'explosive materials production unit'. They quoted Iran's defence industries organisation, saying: 'Unfortunately, due to the incident, two workers of this production unit lost their lives.' The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, believe Iran carried out explosives tests at Parchin around a decade ago that could be related to an attempt to develop a nuclear weapons capability. Iran has been refusing the agency access to the complex since 2005. Officials now fear that the Iranian government is seeking to cleanse the compound of evidence. But Tehran says Parchin is a conventional military facility and . that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. It has often . accused its enemies of seeking to sabotage its atomic . activities.

"Rafael Nadal was brought back down to earth with a bump by Dustin Brown in Halle. Four days after winning the French Open for a record ninth time, Nadal lost his opening match on the grass 6-4 6-1 in less than an hour. Brown, the flamboyant and big hitting Jamaican-German, was not the man Nadal would have wanted to meet as he tried to find his feet on the grass. Bags packed: Rafael Nadal did not last long at Halle, losing to Dustin Brown in straight sets . War cry: Brown beat Nadal 6-4, 6-1 in less than an hour . Hands up: Brown, ranked 85th, made light work of world No 1 Nadal . Serial winner: Nadal claimed a ninth French Open at Roland Garros on Sunday . The world No 1 looked to have adjusted well in the first set but Brown, who beat Lleyton Hewitt at Wimbledon last year, broke serve in the 10th game and did not look back. In the opening five games of the second set, Nadal won just five points and, although he stopped the rot eventually, 85th-ranked Brown confidently served out the best win of his life. Nadal had said before leaving Paris that his expectations for Halle were not high but, having won just one match in two years at Wimbledon, it is hardly ideal preparation. Off the pace: The Spaniard will have to up his game if he is going to make any impact at Wimbledon . Low key: Nadal had said his hopes for success in Halle were not high . Room for improvement: Nadal has only won one game at Wimbledon in the last two years . Defending champion Roger Federer avoided the same fate but did have a scare against Portugal's Joao Sousa.

The Swiss was in a positive mood after the match, saying on the ATP's official website: 'It was slightly frustrating at times clearly, but nevertheless I served well and kept on doing my thing. 'It was important to stay calm and actually I think it gives me more confidence winning this way. I had to stay calm, fight through the match and find a way and then the last set and a half were much better. So, I'm actually pretty happy now.'

"A former showjumper is lucky to be alive after she was brutally attacked with an ice skate, leaving fragments of skull in her brain. Jemma Fitzgerald, 20, was left with blood gushing out of her head after being hit with the blade while walking alone in Shotton, near Chester. Her injuries were so severe she was immediately transferred from the Countess of Chester Hospital to the intensive care unit at Walton Centre in Liverpool, a hospital specialising in brain injuries, where surgeons had to remove fragments of her skull from her brain. Jemma Fitzgerald's injuries were so severe she was immediately transferred to a specialist brain hospital . Jemma said she had been out walking alone one evening when the attack came 'completely out of the blue' Two weeks on from her ordeal, doctors have told Ms Fitzgerald they are unsure if she will ever fully recover from her injuries. Ms Fitzgerald said: 'I was on my way to meet some people about a charity event for Cancer Research when I was hit in the head with an ice skate completely out of the blue. I actually didn't feel anything and only realised what had happened when I felt blood running down my face. 'I wasn't really sure what to do and didn't realise how serious it was at the time, to be honest.' She paid tribute to a teenage boy and his dad who helped her after the attack until an ambulance and police arrived. Jemma shows her deep scars and says she has no memory of the trip to the hospital after being bludgeoned . Ms Fitzgerald says she has no memory of her trip to hospital and it was only the next day that she learned just how serious her injuries were. She said: 'Apparently I was in intensive care up until my operation where doctors found I had a depressed skull and fragments of bone in my brain which they had to remove. The surgeon told me that realistically I shouldn't be alive.' The former showjumper and steeplechase rider is still struggling to carry out everyday tasks and fears she may never ride a horse again. 'I'm suffering from memory loss and have difficulty speaking as the words just sometimes won't come. I've also been left with weakness in my left arm and leg. 'It's really scary as I've always ridden horses and to think that I may never even be able to get on a horse again terrifies me.' She added: 'I don't think it has really sunk in as I'm still running on adrenaline and on medication.' Ms Fitzgerald, who lives in Chester, is alleged to have been assaulted at a junction in Shotton, near Chester, a short distance from Deeside Ice Rink, at about 7.20pm on Wednesday, September 17. A 27-year-old woman from Merseyside was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been released on police bail pending further investigations.

"Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll has described Australia’s Jarryd Hayne as ‘an incredible athlete and a great competitor’ and the prospect of recruiting him is ‘an exciting thought.’ The NRL player’s manager says the Seahawks aren’t the only club showing an interest, claiming they are being flooded offers from NFL clubs interested in meeting Hayne. ‘There is literally hundreds of emails I am trying to answer,’ Hayne’s manager, Wayne Beavis, told SMH. Scroll down for video . Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, discussed Jarryd Hayne at a media conference on Thursday (pictured), describing the recently-retired NRL player as 'an incredible athlete and a great competitor' Big moment: Hayne dabs his eyes with a handkerchief as he announces his decision to pursue his dream of playing American football . The Seahawks' coach explained to media that Hayne's (left) NRL skills make him someone the Seattle Seahawks (right) are interested in meeting with . ‘There are agents, there are clubs… You name it they are all here. ‘It’s massive, it has exceeded our wildest expectations… there is no shortage of people wanting to look after Jarryd.' The 2014 Dally M Award winner announced his retirement from NRL, in the hope of establishing a career as an NFL player. The NSW and Parramatta Eels fullback is expected to fly to Los Angeles next week to commence his training in preparation for the NFL Combine in February. Hayne is already making headlines in the US, and the Seahawks coach was quizzed about Hayne during a media conference on Thursday. NFL coach Pete Carroll did not rule out the possibility of signing the former NRL player but refused to go into specifics, explaining he was ‘afraid to mention anything’ due to contractual obligations'. 'He’s an incredible athlete and a great competitor which is the kind of stuff we like,' Carroll said. ‘I don’t think I’m able to talk about him as far as I know. We don’t want to mess it up,’ Carroll explained. An emotional Hayne reflected on how he has played for the Eels since he was 13 and accomplished great things, such as buying his mother a house .

It’s claimed Carroll was told to expect questions about Hayne from Australian journalists before the press conference– but in reality, is totally unaware of the dual-Dally M winner. However, Carroll spoke about length about Hayne's appeal. ‘But I always thought it would be really cool to recruit down there (Australia) because there are some great players and it’s a great game,’ Carroll told the media conference. Speculation has mounted that the Seahawks have an invested interest in Hayne due to the NRL player’s rapport with the club. In September, the 26-year-old visited the Seahawks’ facility, the Virginia Mason Athletic Centre. The Seahawks coach praised Hayne for his ability and that the rugby league player’s abilities would translate well to American Football. Fan favourite: Many fans adore Jarryd Hayne, a Dally M medal winner . Adios! Hayne is reportedly pursuing a new American football career . ‘It’s a very physically demanding game and those guys have all the kinds of stuff we look for in our guys,’ Carroll said.

His mother is thrilled that Hayne is able to achieve his dreams, after humble beginnings growing up in a housing commission. ‘Growing up we always had little houses. I used to sleep in the lounge room on a mattress so I could protect the kids, so if anybody came in I’d be the first one there,’ said Ms Hayne. ‘I am so happy for him, just to follow his dreams. ‘To watch his kick that ball around as a kid and now to go and do it – I am so excited for him.’ The Central Coast home Jarryd Hayne bought for his mother jodie, thanks to his success as an NRL player .","Seattle Seahawks coach indicated they are interested in meeting with recently-retired NRL star Jarryd Hayne .

"FIFA has denied claims by Diego Maradona that officials preventing him attending Argentina's opening match of the World Cup in the Maracana.

"Premier League clubs are screening African football players who have returned from international matches for Ebola, amid the Ebola crisis on the continent. Cheick Tiote, Papiss Cisse and Wilfried Bony are among the players who will be checked for the virus, after competing in African Nations Cup qualifiers. It comes as health officials announce that airport screening for the killer disease, which was put in place at Heathrow earlier this week, will be extended to Manchester and Birmingham. Scroll down for video . Cheick Tiote (left) and Papiss Cisse (right) are among the players being closely monitored following their return from international qualifiers in Africa, where the Ebola crisis is deepening . Swansea City's Wilfried Bony, who plays for Ivory Coast, will also be tested after competing in West Africa . Although no players have travelled back to the UK from the worst-affected parts of West Africa, the potential spread of the killer disease is being 'closely considered' by various club medics. Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew said the club had a 'strategy' in place to closely monitor cup hopefuls Tiote and Cisse, who returned to Tyneside after representing the Ivory Coast and Senegal respectively. Wilfried Bony, who plays for Swansea, will also be put through tests after returning from playing with the Ivory Coast, his club confirmed. But Manchester City FC  said the club would 'not be engaging publicly in any discussion' about Yaya Touré and Ebola for patient confidentiality reasons. A spokesman did confirm the Ivory Coast captain was back at the training ground yesterday. Speaking about his two players, Pardew said: 'We'd be naive not to have concerns. We have a strategy for when they return and making sure they and their families are taken care of. 'They're essential to us and our doctor has looked into the problems that might arise and also protection for them and to make sure we do our very best to help them.' Midfielder Tiote has been in DR Congo with the Ivory Coast, while Cisse was with Senegal in Dakar this week. Neither country has an outbreak. Pardew continued: 'The two boys who travelled to Africa are not back yet but reports are that they're both well. Manchester City FC has refused to say whether Yaya Touré - the Ivory Coast captain - was screened for the virus on return from the African continent . 'Of course it's a worry when you've got players such a long way away, you're just looking at your phone hoping no messages come thorough that are negative. We've been lucky this time around.' A spokesman for Swansea insisted the checks being given to Bony were no different to those given to all players returning from international games. But he said the club was 'well aware' of the Ebola situation. He said: 'Out of our players, it is only Bony that has returned from Africa. The club is well aware of the situation, but the doctors are quite relaxed about it. 'He will go through normal fitness checks and medical tests which any player returning from an international game would go through.' A football source said yesterday that the Premier League was not 'particularly concerned' about any risk of the deadly virus being brought back. Manager Alan Pardew said Newcastle FC would be 'naive' not to take precautions following the Ebola outbreak . They said: 'Players are probably more closely monitored health-wise than any individuals in the country. They are surrounded by doctors and their levels are tested daily. 'It has crossed the minds of the Premier League and certainly club doctors, but none of the players have gone out to countries affected by Ebola - unless you count the US.' A Premier League also told MailOnline that it had not issued any advice on Ebola because guidance was already available from health officials. He said it was up to each individual club to decide how best to look after their players. West Ham United refused to comment on whether there were procedures in place for the return of Cheikhou Kouyaté, who represents Senegal. When asked about Senegal player Mohamed Diamé, who competed in the qualifiers, Hull City also said it would not comment. Another player who is believed to have competed in international qualifiers in Africa include Sadio Mané from Southampton. The club was not available for comment. The returning players were competing in qualifiers for the Africa Cup of Nations, due to be held in Morocco in January. There have been fears the competition could be postponed if the deadly virus is not contained, while Ghana also revealed it has been approached about staging the competition if Morocco withdraws. Health officials began screening arrivals at Heathrow on Wednesday. Downing Street said the regime is poised to be rolled out across Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal . The screening techniques include a form  for passengers to fill in, asking about potential symptoms of the virus . The Ghanaian sports minister said he had been contacted by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), which was also said to have been in touch with the South African Football Association. Up to a million spectators are expected to travel to watch the African Cup of Nations. Pardew added: 'That's something that will play out as we go along. That kind of decision is a big, big one and I'm sure the countries will make that rather than club managers. 'It's something to be concerned about and we have to be on our guard.' Agents for Tiote and Cisse refused to comment. Agents for Toure and Bony were unavailable for comment. Meanwhile, Sierra Leone midfielder Michael Lahoud, who plays in the US for Philadelphia Union, said team-mates from the national side had felt humiliated by their treatment by opponents. Sierra Leone have been forced to play home African Cup of Nations qualifiers in neutral countries because of the Ebola outbreak. He said rival fans chanted 'Ebola' at the team and some opponents refused to shake hands or swap shirts after the game. Dele Adebola, the former Birmingham City and Coventry City striker, was last week forced to deny that he has  Ebola. The Nigerian forward, who currently plays in the Northern Premier League for Rushall Olympic, had been constantly asked on Twitter if he had the disease by those who thought his name sounded similar to the deadly virus. After several tweets and jokes poking fun at his name, Adebola finally responded: 'Guys please stop asking if I have ebola. 'I do not have it. But I thank you for caring about my health and wellbeing :-) Dele.' He told BBC Sport: 'It is really causing a lot of tension and friction.' He has not been involved with the national side this month as it is the climax of the MLS season in the US. On Wednesday, Public Health England began screening passengers arriving at Heathrow Terminal 1 after taking indirect flights from West Africa. It is expected to roll out across Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras, London, next week. Public Health England announced the regime will then be implemented at Manchester and Birmingham, once measures at the other ports of entry have 'settled'. In his weekly message to staff, Duncan Selbie said: 'Next week the focus will be on Gatwick and St Pancras and, once settled there, we will then move to include Manchester and Birmingham. 'I appreciate very much that we are taking people away from their normal work, and please be assured that we are thinking hard and listening carefully to those on the ground to see how we can make this more sustainable. 'What I am certain of is that we have the people who know how to keep the country safe and that is exactly what we will do.' The process involves being questioned to establish any potential exposure to the disease. The person also has their temperature taken. They are then declared free to go, referred for further assessment, classed as low risk and sent away with information to monitor their own condition, or classed as higher risk and actively monitored. Authorities were heavily criticised on the first day of screening at airports when it emerged checks were not compulsory and only those who 'show symptoms of the virus' were being spoken to. David Cameron, who yesterday chaired a meeting of the Government's Cobra contingencies committee on the outbreak, will use an EU summit in Brussels next week to push for more funding and assistance for the poverty-stricken countries which are struggling to contain outbreaks. Mr Cameron has urged other European countries to introduce Ebola screening regimes at airports, warning they 'must do more' to halt the spread of the killer disease. At Thursday's Cobra meeting the Prime Minister voiced doubts about the quality of protection in place in Europe, saying other governments should emulate the checks brought in by the UK. It is estimated the death toll from the Ebola crisis will rise to more than 4,500 lives this week from among 9,000 people infected by the deadly disease. Dr Isabelle Nuttall of the World Health Organisation said the new numbers also show the outbreak is hitting health workers hard, with 2,700 infected and 236 dead. She told reporters in Geneva that cases are doubling every four weeks, and the effects of the crisis are increasingly being felt beyond its epicentre in West Africa.","Players have been taking part in African Nations Cup qualifiers this week .

"Creepy clown hoaxes have landed YouTube sensations DM Pranks a Hollywood feature deal, but that can wait - first the Italian reality horror outfit wants to terrify fans for Halloween. A new film by the team from Magione, Perugia, led by Matteo, replaces their brutal Bozo character, who duped passers-by into believing he was committing gory murders, with a spooky flesh-craving mutant character. With the star's costume made by Matteo’s grandmother and three of their six-man crew for the latest film his cousins, it’s a genuine family affair and can be watched here first on MailOnline. In one prank, the mutant slices through a model with an axe like a hot knife through butter . DM Pranks is coming up on 2.5 million followers on YouTube after they begun to upload the videos they’ve been making since college last July, and have amassed 380,000 Facebook fans. Hollywood came knocking and after a host of meetings with interested producers a deal was struck with Dallas Sonnier, of independent filmmakers Caliber Media, to make their first feature. ‘Over the past few months, I have been getting tonnes of emails and calls from production companies in Hollywood wanting to make a movie with me,’ Matteo says. '[We] developed a brilliant idea for a movie that I¹m going to do with his company.' Matteo aims to have a script ready to roll by next year which ‘will be scary, but in a fun way’. The new work shows the power of their pranks with the star of the show coming straight from the  horror genre copybook. The costume that scares the pants off the general public was made by one of the filmmaker's grandmothers . A disfigured head, gnarly yellow teeth and dark cape ensure that when he emerges from the darkness armed with a range of weapons - including a pitch fork, scythe and a bow and arrow - the passing members of the public are duly scared out of their wits. In the most gory moment of the film, the mutant slices through a dummy with an axe to reveal fleshy insides as a couple walks by. ‘I will always work with my team to keep producing top-notch pranks,’ he says. 'People always like to see other people run for their lives. As a member of the public walks along a path, the mutant on the grassy knoll (right out of shot) fires an arrow . The big finale when the mutant appears to be feasting on a collection of corpses before a man arrives . Naturally, the man (to the right) screams help and makes a hasty escape from the cape creature . Their latest effort was 10-day filming project followed by 30 hours of editing. The tight team of six people along with Matteo. Executing a perfect prank is just part of the challenge for the DM crew, with police and the stars of their videos – the unassuming public – often standing in the way. ‘Many people won’t let us use them in the video and have called the police to make us erase the scene on the camera,’ says Matteo. In their new video Matteo said they were descended upon by six police cars and 15 officers after we filmed with the fake gun. The clown character features in a previous hit video, faking to smash a man's head in a car park with a mallet . The element of surprise is key, as two unknowing men walk around the corner and see the clown in action . The clown spooks a man at a petrol station pouring a mystery clear liquid on the ground around his car . ‘Sometimes we get scared, we had few violent reactions which for obvious reasons are not in any video,’ Matteo says. The mutant film stands among DM’s proudest products to date, says Matteo, as their increasing success means they can offer a higher quality of production. ‘This is one of my favourites,’ says Matteo. ‘I’m trying to move in another directions making the video look more cinematic and better quality.’","DM Pranks landed a Hollywood deal after their clown horrors went viral .

"One of the longest-held prisoners at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay was sent home to Kuwait on Wednesday, the first release based on the determination of a review panel that has been re-evaluating some men previously classified as too dangerous to release. Sent home: Kuwaiti national Fawzi al-Odah, one of the longest held prisoners of Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base,  Fawzi al-Odah, was sent back to his homeland Wednesday after 13 years . Fawzi al-Odah had been told his release was imminent but didn't know the date until shortly before he boarded the flight back to his country from the base in southeast Cuba, his lawyer, Eric Lewis, said. The 37-year-old al-Odah had been the focus of an arduous battle to secure his release that had the support of his government. Lewis, who spoke to him about a week before the departure, said the prisoner just wanted to get on with life. 'There's no bitterness, there's no anger,' Lewis said. 'There's just excitement and joy that he will be going home.' Al-Odah faces a minimum of one year at a militant-rehabilitation center on the grounds of a Kuwaiti prison under the transfer agreement. Lewis said that after six months al-Odah will be eligible to leave for part of the day to work or see family. His transfer brings the detention center population to 148 and is the first since May, when President Barack Obama angered Congress by trading five Taliban prisoners for captive Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl without notifying lawmakers. The release of al-Odah was criticized by U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a chief proponent of keeping the prison open. The New Hampshire Republican called it 'yet another dangerous example of the Obama administration's misguided motivation to empty and then close Guantanamo rather than protect the national security interests of the United States.' Al-Odah had been at Guantanamo since February 2002, one of the first prisoners brought to the base on suspicion of links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. The Obama administration has pledged to keep trying to close the facility, which opened in January 2002, and additional releases are expected in the coming months, so al-Odah's record as the longest-held detainee to be released isn't likely to stand long. His father, Khalid al-Odah, said in several interviews with The Associated Press over the years that his son was only a teacher in Afghanistan who had been wrongly turned over to the U.S. authorities in exchange for a bounty. 'Sometimes my wife calls my other son Fawzi. Other times I wake up in the middle of the night and find her sleeping in Fawzi's room,' the father said in a 2005 interview. 'It's an unbearable sadness most of the time.' Al-Odah faces a minimum of one year at a militant-rehabilitation center on the grounds of a Kuwaiti prison under the transfer agreement. Lewis said that after six months al-Odah will be eligible to leave for part of the day to work or see family (here, Guantanamo's Camp X-Ray is pictured in April) The Kuwaiti government hired high-profile lawyers and lobbyists to push for the release of a dozen of its citizens at Guantanamo, an effort set back when one carried out a suicide bomb attack in Iraq in April 2008. An Obama administration task force charged with evaluating all the prisoners at Guantanamo placed al-Odah and another Kuwaiti among a group slated for indefinite 'law of war detention.' The men in this group can't be prosecuted, typically because there is not enough evidence, but the government considers them too dangerous to release. The administration also set up a Periodic Review Board that has been slowly re-evaluating the prisoners with parole-style hearings to determine if some can be released as part of an overall effort to eventually close the detention center. In July, the board determined that al-Odah had most likely undergone terrorist training in Afghanistan and may have fought alongside the al-Qaida or the Taliban. The board, however, decided he had only a low level of training, did not have a leadership position in either group and could be released under certain conditions. The board has cleared a handful other detainees but they have not yet been released. The board determined that Faez al-Kandari, the last remaining Kuwaiti at Guantanamo, should still be held. His military lawyer, Air Force Lt. Col. Barry Wingard, said Wednesday that he saw no immediate prospects for the release of his client. Another one gone: al-Odah's transfer brings the detention center population to 148 and is the first since May, when President Barack Obama angered Congress by trading five Taliban prisoners for captive Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl without notifying lawmakers .","Fawzi al-Odah, 37, had been the focus of an arduous battle to secure his release that had the support of his government .

"When developers started planning a solar farm in a picturesque village, perhaps they should have found out who lived there first. Because then they’d have realised one of its residents fronts a band with ‘Rebel’ in the name … so there was always going to be trouble. Steve Harley, of 1970s rock group Cockney Rebel, has joined his fellow villagers to protest against plans to cover 40 acres of land in the Stour Valley with solar panels. The unspoiled area was the subject of paintings by Constable and Gainsborough. 'It will ruin a beautiful part of our heritage': Steve Harley at the proposed site of the solar power plant which will cover these fields near the village of Belchamp Otten, Essex, where he has lived for the past 25 years . Under the plan, 25,000 panels surrounded by a security fence will be built in a field on the edge of Belchamp Otten in Essex. Harley, 62, who made his name with hits including Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me),  has lived in the village for 25 years. He said: ‘It is a shockingly ugly plan that will ruin a beautiful part of our heritage. ‘It won’t create any jobs, it won’t benefit the village in any way at all and we fear that this will be the first of many similar applications for solar farms here. ‘We live among green fields of grass, yellow fields of corn and blue fields of flax. These massive and monstrous fields of glass and alloy are unthinkable to those of us who love  the countryside. ‘Solar panels belong on brownfield sites and roof-tops – not on the fields of the Stour Valley,  an area painted by Constable  and Gainsborough.’ Hey day: Harley, 62, made his name with hits including Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) The developers claim the solar panels, which would provide power for up to 1,700 homes, will be mostly hidden from view. But residents who object to the scheme say the panels will be clearly visible for miles around. Terry McGuire, chairman of Belchamp St Paul and Belchamp Otten parish council, said: ‘We fear these things might escalate – there is already talk of plans for even larger solar farms next door to this site. 'They will have a massive impact on this community and could open the floodgates, and we will strongly resist all such schemes.’ Planning notice: Sovereign Energy Partners has applied for permission, which is still under consideration .

The village of Belchamp St Paul: Residents who object to the scheme say panels will be visible for miles around . Local resident Andrew Clarke said: ‘We have one of the best unspoilt medieval landscapes in Britain which has been documented and to compromise it would set a depressing and irreversible precedent.’ Sovereign Energy Partners has applied for planning permission for the development, which is under consideration. Charles Houston, a chartered  surveyor at the firm, said: ‘Following a generally positive response from the community we submitted our application to the council once we had ticked all the boxes. 'We understand residents’ concerns about cumulative impact but they are unfounded. ‘We spent a lot of money preparing our landscape and visual impact assessment survey which covers all angles on that impact but if we have missed anything then the planning officer will ask us to carry out more.’","Harley, 62, lives in a village near to proposed site of the solar power plant .

"An Oregon couple were lucky to escape injury after their dog triggered a trip wire that was attached to a homemade gun in the woods last week. Mike and Jennifer Colbach. of Portland, were hiking in Forest Park last Thursday when they noticed two men who 'were acting really hinky'. The pair appeared out of nowhere and Mike said they looked like 'the back end of a robbery', according to The Oregonian. While walking into the main trail, Mike and Jennifer noticed a parachute cord on the ground, which they avoided, but their dog Rhoda stepped on. Scroll down for video . Investigating: Mike Colbach (right) and his dog Rhoda returned to a trail near their home outside Forest Park   in Portland, Oregon to show police a trip wire attached to an improvised gun on the trail last week . Lucky escape: Fortunately no one was injured when the dog tripped the wire . The couple realized that something was moving in the trees and, somewhat alarmed, quickly left. However Mike Colbach was troubled about what happened on their regular walking route and went back to investigate a few days later. He discovered the cord was rigged up through the trees to a makeshift gun. The weapon was made from a pipe, that was opened one end and closed the other. At the closed end was a firing pin, and inside the pipe was a shotgun shell. Tripping the parachute cord was meant to trigger a beer bottle that would swing down and hit the firing pin, causing the bullet to fire. However it must have malfunctioned with the Colbach's dog stepped on in it. 'Members of the bomb squad told me, ''Dude, you had a shotgun shell pointed right at your head - twice'','Mr Colbach told The Oregonian after reporting the matter to police. Mike Colbach said the parachute cord was rigged to a three-quarter-inch-diameter pipe - open at one end, closed at the other - attached to a tree . Scene: The incident occurred in Forest Park, a popular hiking and walking spot in Portland, Oregon . Police have taken the weapon as evidence. Authorities said it was rare to see such a device in a public park, as they tend to be more common in rural areas where people are trying to protect something. No other such booby traps have been found in the park. Mr Colbach believes it was the work of the two men they saw.","Device was found at Forest Park in Portland, Oregon .

"UKIP has unveiled a new ‘wag tax’ on designer goods as the party opened its conference in Doncaster today. The party’s economic spokesman Patrick O’Flynn said it made ‘no sense’ to levy VAT on everyday goods at the same rate as luxury items unaffordable to all but the very richest. He said there should be an extra 5 per cent tax on £200 shoes, £1,000 handbags and £50,000 cars. Scroll down for video . Mr Farage has pledged to cut income tax from 40p to 35p for people earning up to £55,000 - but will increase VAT on luxury goods . The tax - which has been dubbed a 'wag tax' - would hit the Ryder Cup golfers' wives and girlfriends, or 'Gwags', led by Amy Mickelson (second right) yesterday . Mr O’Flynn said the party would also look to scrap a loophole which allows foreign visitors from outside the EU to claim back VAT on shopping sprees in London and elsewhere. He said the party was now ‘mainstream not extreme’, unveiling sweeping tax changes. These include raising the personal income tax allowance to the level of the full-time minimum wage. This would mean no-one paying income tax until they earn over £13,500 a year. The party would also cut the 40 per cent rate of income tax to 35 per cent for earnings between £42,000 and £55,000. Inheritance tax would also be scrapped altogether. Mr O'Flynn told the conference: 'I want it to investigate the feasibility of imposing a luxury goods rate of VAT. 'It makes no sense to me that VAT is levied at the same rate on budget items purchased by the hard-pressed as it is on premium ones that are the preserve of the very well heeled. ‘And it seems to me that a luxury goods rate of 25 per cent could raise substantial extra funds from the wealthiest people. 'I would suggest such a rate be built around simple thresholds such as £200 for a pair of shoes, £1,000 for a bag or £50,000 for a new car.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited a Doncaster cafe talking to workers  before his speech at the UKIP conference in the town today . A UKIP delegate at Doncaster Racecourse (left) listens intently while the party's Scottish MEP David Coburn (right) arrives to hear the party's leader Nigel Farage speak this afternoon . The UKIP party conference at Doncaster Racecourse sold a host of speciality products, including this 'Let's Rock Politics' stick of rock . He also explained the party’s bid to scrap tax-free shopping for foreigners. Mr O’Flynn said: 'The Treasury calls it ""tax free shopping"". It basically means that foreign nationals can claim back the VAT paid on purchases by filling out a form at the airport. ‘So foreign tycoons can get 20 per cent off their purchases in London, thanks to a Treasury waiver that is in turn bankrolled by ordinary British taxpayers. 'The Treasury is very coy about how much revenue is lost to VAT rebates to foreigners. But HMRC calculates that it is at least £300million a year and I have seen estimates which point to it being significantly higher. This perk should be scrapped.' It comes after MailOnline revealed super rich Arabs were spending £4.5million a day in Britain - cementing London's position as the world's top playground for the rich. In total last year £1.25billion was spent in the UK by families from the Middle East - amounting to some £25,000 for every holiday. The party attacked the 'Westminster clowns' in the main political parties in Parliament, including Ken 'The Euro Clown' Clarke, the former Conservative Cabinet minister . David Cameron was a figure of fun for many of the UKIP delegates in Doncaster today . UAE visitors meanwhile lavished £156 a day, according to the Office for National Statistics. They are the biggest spenders of all foreign visitors to Britain. Only tourists under the title 'other middle east' spend more - at some £173 a day. Egyptians are the third biggest spenders, handing over £149 a day during their stay. American tourists as a whole contribute more than Arabs to Britain's tourist industry - spending a total of £1.5billion last year. But the number of visitors from the US far outstrips those from the Middle East - leaving the spending per person from the Arab world way ahead of that from the Americans. Arabs now spend twice as much as Australians, Germans and French - and 50 per cent more than Americans. Spending by overseas visitors last year soared by 12.7 per cent since 2012 to £21billion. More than half of this - some 53.6 per cent - was spent in London. The amount spent by overseas visitors in the capital itself almost doubled between 2003 and 2013.","Economic spokesman Patrick O'Flynn calls for new luxury goods tax .

"Smartphones enable us to be constantly connected. And now a new survey reveals that people are taking their tech addiction to the bathroom with them. It found that a third of Britons admit to answering work calls while on the toilet, with almost 80 per cent admitting they are ‘toilet tweeters’. Revolting: A new study has revealed that a third of Britons admit to answering work calls while on the toilet (illustrated), with almost 80 per cent say they are ‘toilet tweeters’ The study of more than 2,000 Britons, found more than half of people surf the net, respond to emails and interact on social media while sitting on the toilet. Interestingly, it shows that despite admitting to using technology in the bathroom ourselves we have double standards when it comes to others. While 70 per cent of people say the thought of someone calling them on the toilet is disgusting, almost 40 per cent have done just that by phoning a colleague, according to the survey, which was commissioned by bathstore.com. It appears that women are more likely to pick up the phone to talk in the bathroom than men, with 15 per cent of females saying that they have spoken to a friend, compared to just six per cent of males. Multitasking: The study also revealed that some people use their time in the bathroom to sort out their finances using online banking - 30 per cent- or watch a TV programme - 15 per cent - while going about their business . A survey released in July showed that half of us play mobile games while sitting on the toilet. Men are most likely to play while going to the toilet at 50 per cent, compared to around a third of women, according to Mind Candy. Almost 60 per cent of people admited to pushing buttons as opposed to counting sheep. The survey revealed that women find it hardest to switch off at bed time, with over two thirds gaming before lights out, compared to 52 per cent of men. On average, people who play gaming apps on their smartphone wile away nearly 45 minutes a day. The study also revealed that some industrious people use their time in the bathroom to sort out their finances using online banking - 30 per cent - or watch a TV programme - 15 per cent - while going about their business. ‘The bathroom isn't the place to hold a conversation and people should especially not be tempted to pick up the phone when they're at home,’ said William Hanson, bathstore's etiquette expert . ‘If you're mid-way through a conversation with a colleague at work, put the conversation on pause until you've finished your business.’ A recent study found that half of people play mobile games such as Candy Crush, while going to the toilet. According to the survey, by London-based gaming group Mind Candy, men have the worst habits, with more than half confessing a quick, secret gaming fix while in the bathroom. A previous survey has found that 58 per cent of people admit to pushing buttons as opposed to counting sheep before bed. Women find it hardest to switch off at bed time, with over two thirds gaming before lights out, compared to 52 per cent of men .","Survey reveals a third of Britons admit to answering work calls on the toilet .

"Police have revealed they know not only the cause of death of Hollywood movie executive Gavin Smith, but also why the man was killed. Smith's body was found in a shallow grave in Palmdale, California, on October 26 by a group of hikers, and identified a few days later. He had been missing for two and a half years, having last been seen on May 1, 2012. Scroll down for video . Missing: 20 Century Fox executive Gavin Smith was last seen on May 1, 2012. After a year investigating his disappearance, police declared Smith dead and said it was a homicide case . Now, Lt. Dave Dolson of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department has told ABC News there is evidence that Smith, who was missing before his body was found this week, was slain in his own black Mercedes. At the time he disappeared, Smith was reportedly having an affair with Chandrika Creech, whom he met in rehab. Then, in March of last year, police found Smith's black Mercedes Benz 420E at a Simi Valley storage facility that belonged to John Creech - the husband of Chandrinka and a convicted drug dealer currently serving time in prison. Found: Police today confirmed the identity of a body found on October 26 as that of Smith (pictured with wife Lisa) Happier times: Gavin Smith (left) and wife Lisa with their three sons Dylan, Evan and Austin . And while police will not say if John Creech is a suspect, they did note that they were well aware of the affair between Smith and Chandrika and said that John reamins a person of interest. 'There’s potentially a lot more evidence for us to process, which could develop additional leads, which detectives will have to follow up on,' Dolson said. 'We're very far along and we've made a lot of advancements in the investigation over the past couple of years.' Gavin and Lisa Smith on their wedding day. At the time of his disappearance, Gavin Smith was in the grip of a mid-life crisis involving drugs and at least two mistresses, Mrs Smith said . Revelations about Smith's double life, which played out in the public eye after his disappearnce, were devastating to his wife Lisa and three sons Dylan, Evan and Austin. Shortly after he disappeared, Lisa Smith told MailOnline last year that she felt instinctively that something bad had happened to her husband. 'I think he was murdered,' she said in the interview. 'And I am terrified that whoever did it is going to come after me and our boys.' She said she believed her husband was in the grip of a mid-life crisis that involved drugs and sex with at least three women. Gavin earned $180,000 a year at Fox, distributing hit movies including the Star Wars and Terminator series, Avatar and Titanic. But the couple were struggling to maintain their Hollywood lifestyle and pay the mortgage on their three-bedroom home in the Los Angeles suburb of West Hills. Lisa, an accountant who supported her husband during the early years of their marriage while he struggled as a bit-part actor, discovered he had taken money from his pension fund and squandered his year-end Fox bonus. She also discovered he had a second mistress, named Melanie, in addition to Mrs Creech, and he was apparently setting up a home for her and her family. It was then - two weeks before he disappeared - that Lisa Smith threw her husband out of the house. Mrs Smith, in the MailOnline interview, said her husband appeared to be in the grip of a mid-life crisis in the time leading up to his disappearance, talking about buying new cars for his sons and dressing to impress woman. 'In hindsight, all the signs were there. He was dressing like a 20-year-old to go to drug rehab meetings and working out like mad,' she said. She said Fox stopped paying her husband's salary two months after he disappeared and cleared out his office. Staff left several cardboard boxes of personal items, including framed family photos and golf trophies, on Lisa’s front porch. Apr. 14, 2012: Gavin's 21-year-old son, Evan, takes to Twitter to express his frustration over a family situation. 'Thoughts and prayers out to my amazing Mom and bros plz,' the USC student writes.

Wales are looking to end a record which has seen them go 20 matches since beating any of them, and there were concerns that this had become a psychological battle for them to overcome. Gatland may find some comfort in the fact it was Australia who were the last team from the 'big three' they beat. That was back in November 2008 when they won 21-18. ‘Our primary focus over the next 12 months has to be getting out of our group in the World Cup,’ said Gatland. ‘Although we want to do exceptionally well in the autumn and Six Nations and those are important games for us, the long-term objective is getting out of that group and making the quarter-finals.’ ‘A lot of people have been talking about what’s happened with Kurtley Beale (he was fined £24,600 for sending an offensive picture message to an Australian Rugby Union female team official) and those sorts of things. Does that make them more vulnerable? With Australians, it makes them stronger.

"There was a moment in the second half when Raheem Sterling lost patience with Andrea Pirlo’s dithering and cheekily dispossessed the Italian great on the edge of his own penalty area. The England flyer has not time for reputations, not when he is too busy building one all for himself. It was a fascinating contrast, with Pirlo switching the play at will with those tight balls around the corner and those cute little dummies. Sterling is old-fashioned, always looking to run with the ball, targeting defenders and trying to exploit their weaknesses. The England forward, thrust into the No 10 role, didn’t deserve to be on the losing side. No time for reputations: Raheem Sterling, here dispossessing Italy's Andrea Pirlo, was bold beyond his years . All the tricks: Sterling skips over the challenge of Matteo Darmian in England's 2-1 loss . He played as we knew he would, without inhibition or fear of failure in England’s opening group game at a World Cup in Brazil. Good for him. It is one of the great shames, then, that this didn’t quite turn out to be his night after Mario Balotelli’s second half winner for Cesare Prandelli’s side. His killer pass in the 37th minute took out four of the best defenders Italy has to offer at this tournament and ended up in the back of Salavtaore Sirigu’s net. It was a joyous moment. There was a risk about Roy Hodgson’s decision to pick him from the start, but no-one could ever stand up and be taken seriously again if they said England’s head coach got this wrong. Hodgson had the backing of the country on this one, even if it meant shifting Rooney to the graveyard shift on the left and Danny Welbeck to the right. Everybody wants to see this 19-year-old with the ball at his feet because he can pull off moves that vaporise the opposition. Ghost goal: Sterling's right-footed bullet hit the side netting but had everyone fooled for a moment . Danger man: The 19-year-old wreaked havoc with his willingness to take on Italy's experienced defenders . Close quarters: Sterling (left) in the second-man in as Italy's Mario Balotelli (centre) holds off Wayne Rooney . All over the park: Sterling's touches in the World Cup opener against Italy . In the opening minutes he flew past Gabriel Paletta before hitting the side netting with a powerful strike that many inside the stadium believed had gone in. Undeterred he went again. There was an audacious little first half chip for Danny Welbeck inside the area, the angled run at Andrea Barzagli that threatened to expose Italy’s sluggish defence for pace again. Before Sterling had time to set up another attack, Italy had wised up to him and sent Daniele de Rossi to keep him company in the middle of the park. He still had too much for de Rossi when he set up England’s equaliser, peeling off him to collect the ball midway into Italy’s half. Sterling was razor sharp, demanding the ball from senior players in this England side and trying to make a difference. When he was in possession he was rampant. He is an absolute menace to deal with, even when he was sent out to the right after the introduction of Ross Barkley midway through the second half. Too quick: Antonio Candreva grabs a handful of Sterling's shirt as he's beaten wide on the left side . Set up: Sterling's piercing pass to Rooney on the left was the catalyst for England's first-half equaliser . There was a clamour for Sterling’s inclusion, most of it based on his electrifying performances during the build up to this tournament. Hodgson has been monitoring it over the past few weeks and has compared it to the demand for Rooney to play in the opening game of Euro 2004 against France. Rooney was a kid of 17 them, scoring four times in the group stages before he was injured just 27 minutes into the quarter-final against Portugal. Here in Manaus the momentum is still with Sterling after a performance of conviction and genuine class. Tough stuff: Verratti is out-muscled by teenager Sterling in an at-times physical encounter . He plays at speed, running at opponents in a way that we almost thought was lost to the modern game. It is exhilarating to watch. Sterling carved open Italy’s defence when he sent the ball out to Rooney out on the left in the build up to England’s first half equaliser. Rooney delivered the sweetest touch from his left boot and soon enough Sturridge was performing that trademark dance in the Arena Amazonia. In the end it wasn’t enough for England, but the country will see more from Sterling in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they face Uruguay. We have to. With Sterling in the side, there is still time to get back into this tournament. 3rd Sterling shoots and scores… doesn’t he? The BBC declare ‘goal’, the fans cheer, the pubs celebrate … but his precocious drive from 25 yards swerves away from the goalkeeper’s right hand, but somehow ends up in the side netting. It deserved to be a goal, but that’s not the same. It’s still 0-0. But the Italians now know he is there. 4th Sterling has started centrally and he’s loving the space. But he loses the ball on the edge of the box as he gears up for a run, although it falls kindly for England and Henderson forces a save with a long-range shot. Sterling looks like he is making things happen. 20th As Italy begin to get more possession, England rotate their forwards and Sterling find himself on the left. He tries a dribble but runs in De Rossi and Italy break quickly. Rooney is now inside, trying to get into the game. 21st He creates space, beats the full-back and drives a low, hard cross into the six yard box with his weaker left foot. Danny Welbeck fails to get on the end of it. The BBC studio, including Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Thierry Henry must have been groaning. A fox in the box would have scored from that chance and Sterling’s cross deserved a finish. 45th Half time and Sterling is England’s star of the show, according to Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer. Shearer has been campaigning for his inclusion all week. And the teenage Liverpool forward hasn’t let anyone down. 46th Sterling starts the second half in the same care-free fashion, wriggling past two defenders on the left, but now the Italians know he is coming and they muscle him out with reinforcements. He then concedes the ball in centre-field too easily. 51st Sterling shows he is willing to chase after the ball and closes down Pirlo and retrieves the ball, before starting a counter attack, which may have resulted in a penalty after Danny Welbeck is felled. The referee ignores the pleas. 54th Sterling tries to shoot as he appears on the edge of the box, but it’s blocked by Marco Verratti as Italy become familiar with his threat. Verratti, who has been involved in a struggle with Sterling, is then removed to be replaced by the more defensive-minded Thiago Motta. 63rd Now Sterling is on the right… at times it seems like he is everywhere. He does look a menace with the ball and another dribble leads to an throw. 66th Sterling runs at two defenders and wins a corner. He wants the ball, he’s hungry and he’s dangerous. He’s been England’s best player and doesn’t deserve to be on the losing side. Can he conjure an equaliser? 70th Wish a dashing run into space, slicing through three defenders with his body movement and pace, Glen Johnson tries to find him and Italy are forced to concede another corner. 92nd Is shown a yellow card, taking one for the team as he break up an Italy counter-attack.","England lost their World Cup group D opener 2-1 to Italy in Manaus .

"The sea of red commemorating the fallen that now surrounds the Tower of London is proving overwhelmingly popular with visitors. As Remembrance Day approaches, the 888,246 ceramic poppies – one for each of the Commonwealth soldiers who died in he First World War – offer a focus for reflection on the horrors and sacrifice of conflict. They have been progressively filling the Tower’s 16-acre dry moat over the summer, with the final one being put in place on November 11. Scroll down for video . Yeoman Serjeant Bob Loughlin walks through a mass of ceramic poppies which form the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red tribute at the Tower of London . A volunteer plants one of the 888,246 china poppies at the sea of red commemoration which has been visited by hundreds of thousands of people . It was the vision of artist Paul Cummins, inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town of Derby. He said: ‘I read through wills of First World War soldiers and came across one man who said everyone he knew had been killed. ‘He wrote of “blood swept lands and seas of red, where angels dare to tread”. It read like a poem and it just seemed to fit.’ Paul, who is studying for a PhD at Derby University, added: ‘This is the biggest thing I have done. ‘I am amazed that people have taken it to heart.’ The Royal Shakespeare Company’s theatrical designer Tom Piper helped realise the vision, and each poppy has been sold for £25, raising millions for Service charities. Respect: The Duchess of Cambridge plants a poppy at the Tower of London in August . But how were they actually created? The Mail on Sunday was given a guided tour of the factory specially set up to make the poppies on an industrial estate in Derby. There, almost 50 workers, most of whom have relatives in the Armed Forces, make the flowers by hand... Step one: Sliced and squashed . Step one is to slice the blocks of terracotta clay with a bow saw before it is squashed into thin 4mm sheets in an electronic rolling machine. Worker Will Young slices clay so it can be put through a rolling machine and make it thin enough to mould into the correct shape . Step two: Cut like pastry . The shape of the petals are stamped out with cutters, almost like pastry, in two different sizes for the two layers of the flower. Both are clover-like, with three petals. Michaela Prochazkova stamps petal shapes using cutters at the ceramic poppy factory in Derby . The clay petals are carefully cut out at the factory to make them look as realistic as possible . Step three: A hole lot of work . The two petal shapes are then amalgamated to form the flowers. The workers use the tool above to make a hole manually in the centre of each shape, which are aligned as they connect the layers together. 888,246 poppies - one for each WWI Commonwealth fatality - will be installed at the Tower of London memorial by November 11 . Next step: The two petal shapes are amalgamated and a hole in the centre of the poppy is cut out . Step four: The flower blossoms . The most difficult part of the process is making the final flower. Each one is different, depending on who makes it. The petals on the top layer are lifted up, then those behind are manipulated to subtly support them. Finally the edges of the top petals are squidged together and shaped to make them look more realistic. Worker Nicki Dennett concentrates as she carefully moulds the petals into the shape of the flower . Starting to take shape: The flat shapes are pinched and twisted to make the recognisable flowers . Ms Dennett and Cherelle Bibby make trays of the flowers before popping them on to trays ahead of a blast in a kiln . Step five: You're fired! The clay flowers are then put on racks around the room for 24 hours until they are ‘leather hard’. ‘Because the kilns are on all the time, it’s always warm in here,’ says Paul. ‘So the ambient temperature dries them very quickly. ‘The flowers are then put into a kiln for up to eight hours where they are fired up to 1,000C.’ Hundreds of poppies go into the kiln at once, where temperatures will reach upwards of 1,000C . The fired flowers are then boxed before being sent to another facility to be glazed bright red . Step six: Double glazing . Finally the flowers are dipped twice into a scarlet glaze – a base coat and a top coat – and placed back into the kiln where they are heated to 1,117C. When they have cooled, they are sent to the Tower of London, and put into place, mounted on metal stalks that are stuck into the ground. After the glaze, the clay flowers are dried before being sent to the Tower of London to be planted . The finished works of art are fitted to metal stalks at the Tower before taking their place in the memorial . Paul Cummins, behind Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, holds up one of the finished masterpieces .","888,246 poppies will form the full Tower of London tribute by November 11 .

"The life-extending benefits of clean living, a healthy diet and regular exercise are well-documented. But the key to longevity could be more in mind than body, scientists have revealed. For a study found that older people with the greatest sense of purpose and wellbeing have a life expectancy two years longer than those whose lives hold less meaning. 'Eudemonic wellbeing': Happier people live longer, new research has found. File picture . Some 9,050 Britons with an average age of 65 took part in the research, which was published in The Lancet medical journal. Scientists from University College London – as well as Princeton University and Stony Brook University in the US – examined participants’ ‘eudemonic wellbeing’, relating to their sense of control, purpose and feeling that what they do is worthwhile. Over the eight-and-a-half-year study period, 9 per cent of people in the highest wellbeing category died, compared with 29 per cent in the lowest category. Once other factors such as smoking habits and illness were taken into account, those with the highest wellbeing were found to be 30 per cent less likely to die over the course of the research. They also lived an average two years longer than those in the lowest wellbeing group. Professor Andrew Steptoe from UCL said: ‘We cannot be sure that higher wellbeing necessarily causes lower risk of death, since the relationship may not be causal.’ However, he added that the findings raise the ‘intriguing’ possibility that better wellbeing could improve physical health. ‘There are several biological mechanisms that may link wellbeing to improved health, for example through hormonal changes or reduced blood pressure,’ he said. The findings come after the Government introduced the National Wellbeing Programme in 2010, which tracks levels of life satisfaction across the country.","Scientists examined the ‘eudemonic wellbeing’ of 9,050 Britons over 65 .

"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is investigating the controversial launch of a new Thermomix kitchen appliance, according to emails seen by Daily Mail Australia. The surprise release of the Thermomix TM5 last month - the first of its kind in seven years - was controversial with customers who had recently forked out $1939 for an older model. Many said they were told there was no new product forthcoming. On Friday, several customers who brought the matter to the ACCC received messages from the watchdog saying it was 'engaging with Thermomix' to determine if the company had breached consumer protection laws. Scroll down for video . Several Thermomix customers received messages from the ACCC last week saying the commission was trying to establish whether a breach of the Australian Consumer Law had occurred . Controversy: More than 3000 people like a Facebook page devoted to the company's unhappy customers . 'We are aware of the concerns you and other consumers have raised regarding the release of the new Thermomix model,' the emails said. Ms Fowler, pictured, was one of many aggrieved Thermomix customers . 'We are currently engaging with Thermomix to address these concerns and establish whether a breach of the Australian Consumer Law has occurred.' More than 2500 people signed a Change.org petition calling for Thermomix to address the issue. One recipient of the message, Perth customer Lea Fowler, 57, told Daily Mail Australia she had never seen such a backlash from ordinary mums. When Ms Fowler purchased two Thermomix TM31 products in August - one for herself, another for a friend - she said she was told there was no new model coming out. But the company announced the release of the TM5 on its Australian Facebook page within a month, on September 6. 'I just feel this shouldn't happen to genuine customers that ask the right questions that go into buying a quite expensive machine a lot of us have thought a long time about,' Ms Fowler said. 'I've never seen such a backlash from ordinary mums out there in Australia who have saved hard to buy this machine and they felt really ripped off.' The old model is now readily available on eBay and Gumtree priced around $1500. Brisbane customer Georgina Shelley, an administrator of the Thermomix Unhappy Customers Facebook page, also received the message on Friday. She said the group was waiting with 'bated breath' for a positive response from the ACCC. 'We can speculate whether the company has broken consumer law, (but) we can't say for the sure until we get some response from the ACCC.' The latest development comes after consumer group CHOICE presented Thermomix with a 'Shonky' Award over the brouhaha last week. We are aware of the concerns you and other consumers have raised regarding the release of the new Thermomix model. We are currently engaging with Thermomix to address these concerns and establish whether a breach of the Australian Consumer Law has occurred. The Australian Consumer Law prohibits businesses from misleading consumers. Businesses can mislead consumers by not telling them something. Doing so might be illegal when: . - one person fails to alert another to facts only known to them, and this information is relevant to the decision being made by the consumer . - important details that a person should know are not explained to them . - a change in circumstance before the consumer makes the decision means information already provided is incorrect . If you are seeking an individual remedy you should write to Thermomix to try to resolve this problem. If that does not work you should consider getting independent legal advice about what options are available to suit your situation. You may also be entitled to take your complaint to your local state and territory small claims court or tribunal. The Thermomix is also popular internationally . A yogurt cake produced by a Thermomix machine . CHOICE is calling for customers who purchased an older model Thermomix three months prior to the TM5's release to be given a choice of a full refund, a $250 discount, or an upgrade to the TM5 for $50. Mr Godfrey said the watchdog 'welcomed' news of the ACCC's involvement, saying the company has only offered a discount or upgrade to customers who paid for their Thermomix TM31 after August 20. 'The company has sweetened the deal for those who purchased their models after July 1 by offering them a free blade, bowl and lid set,' he said. 'This isn't good enough and will be joining consumers in calling on the ACCC to look into this issue further.' He told Daily Mail Australia ACCC action is important 'to ensure that this behaviour doesn't set a precedent in the way other companies behave.' According to a company advertisement - set to dramatic music - the TM5 has 10 per cent more capacity than previous models, featured a new measuring cup and a more powerful and quieter motor. Thermomix did not immediately respond to Daily Mail Australia's requests for comment on Monday. The ACCC also refused to comment. Last week a spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the agency is 'limited in its capacity to discuss matters under potential investigation'.","Emails from ACCC to unhappy customers show it is investigating the controversial launch of latest Thermomix product .

"Gary Cahill ought to be well prepared to take on the mantle of being one of England’s dominant and iconic defenders. After all, he plays alongside one in John Terry. The Chelsea captain is not in Brazil despite his resurgence of form in the Premier League, his decision to quit the team in the wake of his FA racism charge having probably cost him an international swansong. Nevertheless, it is to the credit of his Chelsea partner, Cahill, and the form of Phil Jagielka that it has not been a pressing issue in the build-up to Saturday’s game against Italy here. Larger than life: Gary Cahill insists he has enhanced his game from playing with John Terry . Fighting fit: Cahill goes in on Ross Barkley as England are put through their paces ahead of the World Cup . Many see central defence as an area of potential weakness in this England team, but over the past two-and-a-half years Cahill has quietly been growing into Chelsea’s most dependable defender, helped of course by the man alongside him. ‘I’ve learned a lot from John,’ says Cahill. ‘I took things from his leadership and his reading of the game, positionally. ‘John was a leader and I think I’m accepted at this level now, which is pleasing. That’s not to say there is any sort of complacency in my game. There are still people coming up behind you, and I still want to go and achieve as much as I can in my career. I just feel I have been accepted at this level.’ Cahill’s improvement curve has been steady. His performances against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final of 2012 and Bayern Munich in the final and then against Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid last season have seen him deal with the likes of Lionel Messi, Mario Gomez, Edinson Cavani and Diego Costa. Blues brothers: Cahill (left) celebrates with Terry, whom he has formed a rock-solid partnership with . Derbyshire-born, he grew up watching Des Walker at Hillsborough and cites Tony Adams, Sol Campbell and Martin Keown as the dominant England centre halves he recalls. ‘They are goals you have to set,’ he said. ‘You get your opportunity, you try to take it and then you try to build on it. ‘There have been some top-quality centre backs for England, haven’t there? At this moment, in the 23 there are four lads for that position and we are all looking to do as well as we can.’ At the age of 28, this is Cahill’s first international tournament. He missed out on Euro 2012, breaking his jaw in the last friendly before the event. In 2010 he was only an outsider for the squad and a potentially fatal blood clot kept him out of action in the run-up. Now, it is Mario Balotelli he must keep quiet. He has faced him only twice, once for Bolton and once for Chelsea but the omens are good: Balotelli didn’t score in either of those games and was hauled off at half-time against Chelsea. Masterclass: Cahill watched Des Walker star for Sheffield Wednesday when he was a young fan . Cahill also has to contend with the Amazonian humidity and heat, a novel experience for all the players. Yesterday England travelled to Manaus and were confined to a gym session but today they will do light training in the Arena Amazonia. ‘We’ve done all we possibly can,’ he said. ‘It’s hard for English players. We’re not used to this climate full-stop. But we’ve been training and now playing in hot conditions. Miami was roasting for the Honduras game. We’ve done the heat chambers, we’ve done the extra layers of clothing, so we’ve done all we possibly can going into the game so we feel like we’ve prepared the best we can.’ Cahill says the training camp in Portugal was the most uncomfortable: ‘The first  couple of times we trained with all the layers on it was tough. Now we feel a lot better, so it’s obviously worked.’ The true test will be tomorrow when Cahill takes another step on his career progression —  perhaps  to establish himself as an iconic England defender.

"Pepsi special contains dextrin, which is used as a diet aid to reduce 'bad cholesterol' in the blood . If you're watching your weight but diet soft drinks have never been to your taste, there could now be an alternative. Tomorrow Pepsi are launching a version of its cola drink that it claims acts as a fat blocker. Pepsi Special is made with dextrin - an indigestible form of dietary fibre. Studies on rats suggest this can reduce the . absorption of fat in the body and lower . cholesterol levels. There is no information about how much sugar and corn-syrup it contains, compared to standard Pepsi, but a spokesman said it would have a 'crisp refreshing and unique' aftertaste. The drink, which will first be sold in Japan, comes in a 'luxury' gold and black bottle with the Pepsi logo emblazoned on the side. Pepsi hope the drink will have the same runaway success as the Japanese drink Kirin Mets Cola, which also contains dextrin. It will be distributed by Suntory International. It is not the first time that Pepsi have released unusual versions of its drink in Japan. In the past they have sold cucumber and yoghurt-flavoured colas. This Christmas they will be selling Pepsi White, which will have a tangerine tang. Pepsi Special, which will cost 150Yen or £1.20, joins a crowded functional food market in Japan. Here consumers can find everything from fat-fighting chocolate bars to age-defying alcoholic cocktails. There is no word yet on if and when Pepsi Special will go on sale in the U.S and Europe. Sue Baic, a spokesperson from the British Dietetic Association, was sceptical about Pepsi Special's health claims. 'I think this drink is unlikely to make much difference to how much fat you absorb,' she said. 'I can't see any studies that shows dextrin works in people. Even if it has an effect on rats that doesn't mean it will translate into humans. 'I suggest a higher fibre diet with fruit, vegetables and whole grains would be a better way to fill you up and make you feel less hungry. Plus then you would get the benefits of all the vitamins and minerals as well.'","Pepsi Special contains dextrin, which reduces fat absorption .

"Governor Chis Christie shouted down a heckler yesterday as he defended his administration's handling of the rebuilding of New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy. Mr Christie, speaking on the second anniversary of the super storm, was criticized over official efforts to provide assistance following the natural disaster. The recovery has been uneven in New York and New Jersey, with many houses, boardwalks and business rebuilt but many people still unable to return to their homes. One participant at the event, Jim Keady, interrupted Mr Christie's speech several times to criticize the pace of storm aid assistance. Scroll down for video . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie shouted down a heckler as he defended his administration's handling of aid distribution in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy; he was speaking on the second anniversary of the tragedy . Hurricane Sandy, which struck on October 29, 2012, was blamed for causing at least $65 billion in damage . Mr Christie eventually told him: 'Sit down and shut up.' U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and federal officials toured a flood-ravaged neighborhood near Raritan Bay, in Union Beach, where many residents are struggling to rebuild. Andrea Kassimatis held her 6-month-old daughter as she described living with four other relatives in a 37-foot trailer next to a partially built home. 'It's been a rough and grueling process,' she said. 'You feel like your government has forgotten you.' Ms Kassimatis has received a $150,000 rebuilding grant from New Jersey but only got a third of what her flood insurance policy was supposed to pay - a common refrain up and down the coast. She said: 'Don't believe what you have from a flood insurance policy. Because what you're sold is not what you're going to get.' She voiced her complaints to Mr Castro, New Jersey's two U.S. senators, Robert Menendez and Cory Booker, and to Representative Frank Pallone Jr. They agreed more 'accountability and transparency' was needed in Sandy aid distribution. The natural disaster caused catastrophic flooding in New York and cities in New Jersey, including Hoboken and Jersey City, and killed at least 182 people . The storm was spawned when Hurricane Sandy merged with two other weather systems, devastating the coastline including this bar and grill in Sea Bright, New Jersey . At an event in Perth Amboy, state Senate President Steve Sweeney said: 'People still aren't getting the answers they deserve.' The October 29, 2012, storm, which was spawned when Hurricane Sandy merged with two other weather systems, devastated the coastline and caused catastrophic flooding in New York and cities in New Jersey, including Hoboken and Jersey City. It was blamed for at least 182 deaths and $65 billion in damage. In New Jersey, the Fair Share Housing Center faulted the pace of aid distribution, saying only $220 million of the $1.1 billion the state has received for its main rebuilding grant program has been given to homeowners. After dealing with the heckler, Mr Christie later said of the incident: 'It seems like a lot longer than two years. He added: 'This has been a long, long two years and a long struggle. Time doesn't move as quickly as we might like it to.' Mr Christie said his administration will keep working until everyone who needs help gets it. In New Jersey, the Fair Share Housing Center faulted the pace of aid distribution, saying only $220 million of the $1.1 billion the state has received for its main rebuilding grant program has been given to homeowners . Work crews scoop sand from a beachfront swimming pool in Sea Bright, New Jersey, as the town's cleanup from the storm continues; Governor Christie said the natural disaster 'seems like a lot longer than two years' ago and called the recovery  'a long struggle' New York Mayor Bill de Blasio joined City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and other elected officials to work with Habitat for Humanity at a storm-damaged home in Brooklyn. The group has helped rebuild 100 homes in New York. He also toured a Staten Island neighborhood named Ocean Breeze and recounted the destruction. The mayor said: 'This borough, this island, in many ways bore the brunt of the storm: 44 lives lost due to Sandy, 23 from Staten Island. 'A lot of pain, and a lot of memory. We are now safer than we were two years ago, that is a matter of fact. But we have a lot more to do. I can say with assurance, when we gather a year from now, we will be safer than we were in 2014.' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said his state has supported the repair and rebuilding of nearly 10,000 households, provided $20.8 million in grants to small businesses and facilitated the proposal of approximately 600 projects through the NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program.","Christie was criticized over aid distribution after Sandy two years ago .

"Thomas Muller has ended any lingering interest from Manchester United by penning a new contract at Bayern Munich. The Germany international was a target for Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford but has committed to Pep Guardiola's vision for the next five years. Philipp Lahm will also be staying put at the Allianz Arena after agreeing an extension to his deal until 2018 - one that is sure to see his career end in Munich.

Muller had been the subject of interest from across Europe this summer and looked like he could have been on his way out of the Bundesliga champions when he sought assurances over his role within Guardiola's setup. But the 25-year-old revealed that talks with senior figures at the club won him over. 'I am very happy to have extended my contract at Bayern until 2019,' Muller told the club's official website. 'There were some very good discussions with the club who made me realise that I am in the right place here. 'I have the feeling that I am an important part of the club's plans. Bayern Munich has been my club since 2000 and it will remain so in the coming years.' Thirty-year-old Lahm has been the epitome of Bayern's rise over the last few seasons and will remain with them until 2018 at least, adding: 'I will end my career at FC Bayern. That was always my wish.' The developments mean Van Gaal will turn his attentions elsewhere, notably towards Muller's team-mate Toni Kroos, as United bid to arrest the alarming slide of last season.

"A teenager's bedroom was destroyed by her hair extenstions after she blow-dried them for so long that they became so hot they set her bed on fire. After drying the fake locks with a hairdryer, Natasha Lee, 17, left them on her bed while she went downstairs to start her homework. But when she returned a few minutes later she was horrified to find them engulfed in flames and her bedroom in Morecambe, Lancashire, full of smoke. Destroyed: Natasha Lee's bedroom was destroyed after she blow dried her hair extensions, similar to those pictured, for so long they became red-hot and left them on her bed . Scene: After drying the locks, Natasha left them on her bed while she went downstairs to start her homework . Devastated: When she returned a few minutes later she was horrified to find them engulfed in flames and her bedroom in Morecambe, Lancashire, full of smoke . Firefighters were called to tackle the flames, but the blaze on Tuesday evening caused extensive damage to her family home. 'I couldn’t believe my eyes,' Natasha said. 'I’d washed my hair extensions and I’d been drying them for about five minutes. 'I switched off the dryer and left them lying on my bed. I’d only been downstairs about two minutes and when I came back my room was on fire. Family: Natasha and her mother Szbtlana Froloza, 52, escaped unhamed, and the teenager was also able to free her dog and two cats from the flames . Charred remains: All that is left of the hairdryer that caused Natasha's hair extensions to catch fire . Shock: Natasha had thought that the smoke was coming from outside, and did not realise there was a fire inside her room until she turned to see her burning bed . 'When I first saw the smoke I thought maybe it was coming from outside. I didn’t for one second think there was a fire until I turned and saw the bed. 'I ran back downstairs and called 999. It was terrifying.' By the time fire crews arrived, the fire had broken through the first floor bedroom window, with smoke and flames billowing out. Property: Many of Natasha's belongings have been completely destroyed in the fire . Natasha and her mother Szbtlana Froloza, 52, escaped unhamed, and the teenager was also able to free her dog and two cats from the flames. The fire had severely damaged the bedroom, while the landing and one other room on the first floor were also damaged by smoke. Forced to leave: Natasha and her mother are staying with friends until the house is repaired . Natasha said: 'It’s really scary to think it could have been so much worse. 'It’s awful that we can’t live in our house at the moment and we’ve lost so much of our belongings but we’re so grateful we’re all ok. 'We managed to get our pets out too and so we’re trying to focus on the positives. 'They say you learn from experience and I know I will. I certainly won’t be buying hair extensions again and I hope others realise the dangers.' Natasha said she had bought the brown hair extensions from EBay for £30 and that they were advertised as being made from real hair. She added: 'I really think they should come with a warning on them. People just don’t realise they can set on fire like that - I know I didn’t. 'I still don’t really know how they set alight. I think they just got too hot and then leaving them on the bed made it worse. 'If I hadn’t walked back upstairs when I did I dread to think what could have happened. 'My room is ruined and there’s a lot of smoke damage upstairs but at least downstairs is okay. 'We’re just trying to move on from it now and put it behind us. There’s no point dwelling on it.' Natasha and her mother are staying with friends until the house is repaired.

"Greater Western Sydney's Heath Shaw will undergo counselling after Melbourne police arrested the AFL player for drunken behaviour on Saturday morning. Shaw was in Melbourne to support older brother Rhyce, who played in the Sydney side that was smashed in Saturday's AFL grand final. The GWS player, who was not charged, received a fine of $590 for the early morning incident. Greater Western Sydney's Heath Shaw (pictured) was detained and fined $590 by Melbourne police for drunken behaviour on Saturday morning . 'Shaw was a passenger in a car which was pulled over by police ... after a verbal altercation with police, he was taken to St Kilda police station,' a statement from GWS said. GWS chief executive David Matthews suggested Shaw notified the club of the incident and accepted 'he let himself down on this occasion and that his behaviour was unacceptable'. 'We are disappointed with what happened and so is he and we have agreed that he will undergo counselling,' Matthews said in the statement. 'We have also agreed to consider the matter further when he returns to the club after his current leave period.' Shaw joined the Giants at the end of the 2013 season. This is not Shaw's first off-field offence. In 2008 the former club Collingwood suspended the 28-year-old and Alan Didak  for lying about a drink-driving accident.

"As many as 100 guests attending an NAACP gala over the weekend fell ill after having dinner at a luxury San Fransico hotel and were seen throwing up in the lobby. George Holland heads the civil rights organization's Oakland chapter and was among several hundred people at the soiree held at the Sofitel San Francisco Bay Hotel in Redwood City. Officials say 12 people were taken by ambulance to hospitals to be treated for dehydration. Spoiled banquet: Dozens of people fell ill with suspected food poisoning while attending an NAACP gala at the high-end Sofitel San Francisco Bay Hotel in Redwood City, California, over the weekend . Stomach-churning scene: Guests were said to be throwing up all over the hotel lobby after dining on salmon and salad . Witnesses described a horrible and upsetting scene involving people suffering from severe vomiting and diarrhea . Others made their way to the hospital on their own Saturday and Sunday after experiencing severe vomiting and diarrhea. Robyn Thaw, a spokeswoman for the San Mateo Medical Center, tells the Oakland Tribune an initial investigation by county officials found no violations linked to foodborne illnesses at the hotel. Officials are now interviewing those who became ill and reviewing their lab work to try to determine the source. Some 300 people, among them former mayor of San Francisco Willie Brown and former mayor of Oakland Elihu Harris, attended the banquet celebrating the closing of the 27th annual NAACP State Convention. According to George Holland, several guests, including Mr Harris, fell ill after enjoying a dinner of salmon and salad at the grand ballroom of the hotel. By 10.30pm, dozens of people were vomiting all over the hotel lobby as paramedics were trying to tend to them. Dignitary: Former Mayor of San Francisco Willie Brown was a keynote speaker at the event . Former Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris, pictured here with Oakland City Attorney Barbara Parker last year, was among the attendees who came down with food poisoning . ‘It was a terrible scene,’ Holland tells the Tribune. ‘Other hotel guests were very upset.’ Mr Holland added that many of the guests who succumbed to the mystery malady were children, among them a 5-year-old girl. Holland himself also came down with the stomach bug along with his wife. Sandra Pinto Duhamel, of the French hotel chain Accor Hotels that operates the Sofitel, said in a statement to CBS San Francisco: ‘While we do not know the cause of the illness, we are cooperating with Health Department officials at this time. ‘We remain very concerned about the well-being of the guests who became sick and wish them a speedy recovery.’","Banquet celebrating 27th annual NAACP State Convention took place last weekend at Sofitel San Francisco Bay Hotel in Redwood City .

"Impact substitute. It sounds such an all-action role. Often it is. Impact is one of those words that just conjures excitement in the brain. And in the cinema. There is Impact, a 1949 crime drama involving a cheating wife and a duplicitous husband. Impact, a 2008 television mini-series in which an asteroid sets the moon on collision course with earth. Deep Impact, 1998 film, same thing but with a seven-mile wide comet making a pest of itself. And Sudden Impact, the fourth Dirty Harry movie and the one in which Clint Eastwood actually says 'Go ahead – make my day.' Will Roy Hodgson's impact substitute be making anybody's day in Brazil? That is the question. On his bike: Raheem Sterling appeared in good spirits after England touched down in Rio on Sunday . Flying the flag: Sterling was forced to watch Saturday's game from the stands as he was suspended . By popular consent the brightest spark in England's pre-World Cup friendly matches has been Ross Barkley. Mention his name, however, and the phrase impact substitute rolls off an informed tongue by way of reply. In training, Raheem Sterling is said to have excelled. Again the clever money is on his late introduction, when he can have the greatest effect on tired legs, certainly in tropical Manaus on Saturday against Italy. This always presumes there is a contest to have impact on by that time. If England were losing by a slender margin, Sterling or Barkley could snatch a handy point. If they were losing by two goals or more, to claw England's way back against any reasonably competent Italian side would be tough. And if England were drawing? That is where the impact argument falls down. Italy 0 England 0, 20 minutes remaining. Is Hodgson seriously going to gamble on attack-minded substitutions, just at the point when his opponents are quite possibly settling for honours even? Impressive: Ross Barkley has been the brightest spark in England's pre-World Cup friendly matches . The creatives play from the start or, more than likely, they remain spectators if the game is at stalemate long into the second half.  Nobody would blame Hodgson for caution in those circumstances. If he gambled and lost the whole dynamic of the World Cup campaign would change. So the idea of impact substitutions is bunk, unless specific circumstances dictate.  The theory that England will play a game of containment for 75 minutes and, if that works, metamorphose into thrilling cavaliers for the final 15 minutes is so far-fetched it should be a film script. In the Hollywood version, the hero of Impact Substitute comes on and scores four goals in the last ten minutes; in real life he looks glumly on as England and Italy play out time and shake hands. Hodgson sought not to lose in the tight match away in Ukraine last year, too. The score was 0-0 going into the final 30 minutes in Kiev. On the bench were Barkley, Sterling and the form man of the moment, Andros Townsend.  Hodgson brought on Ashley Young for Jack Wilshere, who was having a poor game, and Tom Cleverley for Theo Walcott very late. Early bath: Sterling was sent off during England's clash against Ecuador and was subsequently suspended . To the surprise of nobody he did not go for broke as the referee began checking his watch. He made one like-for-like replacement and another intended to shore up  midfield. That is what managers do. They play the percentages. These warm-up matches have been a missed opportunity, sadly. One of two primary aims has been unfulfilled and that was Hodgson's fault. He needed to find out about the best two youngsters in English football - Barkley and Sterling - and yet on one count remains very much in the dark. Barkley impressed in a cameo against Peru, was even better when starting against Ecuador and made a very good impression coming on at half time against Honduras. In charge: But has Roy Hodgson missed a trick by not starting with Sterling against Peru or Ecuador? Sterling, who knows? Hodgson rejected the chance to start him against Peru or Ecuador and was faced with a young man so desperate to make an impression in that second game that he got sent-off and missed the final match in which he was ear-marked to start. And there is the folly of the impact substitute. By delaying Sterling's involvement, Hodgson lost the chance to see him to any degree of usefulness. In the 1991 FA Cup semi-final with Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur manager Terry Venables was told by the club doctor that Paul Gascoigne would not last much more than 30 minutes.  He had the choice of starting him, or bringing him on. Venables chose to start him. His logic was simple. 'What if we were 3-0 down after an hour? We would never know what difference he could have made.' Tough draw: England were frustrated not to have beaten 10-man Honduras in their final warm-up match . He told Gascoigne to see what he could do in 30 minutes: and he won the game in ten. The myth of the impact substitute eschews another, more logical, tactic. Get ahead and then  consolidate. Defend that lead.  Why can't the impact substitute be the diligent worker whose care sees out the game, once the most dangerous players have done the hardest part? There is a reason the order of play for the singles matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup is so key to the captain's art. Front-load the team too heavily and there is a risk of rookies in the tail not being able to get over the line.  Put all of your best players down the order to finish the job and there is a chance they could be stranded out on the course, the competition over and their match an irrelevance. Tiger Woods was furious when this happened to him at The Belfry in 2002 when Curtis Strange kept all of his strongest golfers in reserve and Sam Torrance of Europe did the opposite. We know that football is about 14 players, not 11, these days, but it seems almost perverse to concede that a player is a match-winner - and that is what an impact substitute equates to, after all - then keep him on the bench. It may be that Hodgson is gearing up to spring a surprise with Sterling, as he did by selecting Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for the first game of the 2012  European Championships against France. It may be that he thinks a slower tempo is the only way a fixture in Manaus can be approached and young attacking players in a first World Cup may run themselves out. Yet it is always harder to work without the ball. England invariably tire in the heat of tournament competition because they do too much hurrying and scurrying, while their opponents keep possession. The greatest impact would involve addressing that historical flaw, a change that would be as startling as any seven-mile wide comet.","Hodgson needed to find out about Raheem Sterling but has failed to do so .

"New Zealand look determined to teach Stuart Lancaster's weakened England side a lesson as they were put through their paces ahead of Saturday's showdown at Eden Park. The All Blacks won all 14 of their test matches in 2013, becoming the first team to ever do so, and are looking toward next year's defence of the Rugby World Cup. Their only loss since that epic win over France three years ago was to England in 2012 but, worryingly for Lancaster without a number of frontline players, New Zealand don't seem keen on suffering a similar fate. Determined: Richie McCaw led the way in New Zealand's training session ahead of Saturday's showdown . Prepared: New Zealand became the first team in the professional era to complete an unbeaten season in 2013 . Unbeaten: The All Blacks failed to lose last year, winning 14 of their test matches in 2013 . Paces: Ma'a Nonu (left) and Brodie Retallick (right) are put through their paces and want to extend their run . Lancaster expects the players available for the first test to grasp their opportunity and to measure up to ‘the biggest challenge in world rugby’. That is, playing the All Blacks at home. New Zealand coach Steve Hansen has had just a few selection issues. With Dan Carter still unavailable on ‘sabbatical’, the choice for fly half came down to the in-form Beauden Barrett or the more seasoned but out-of-form Aaron Cruden. He opted for the latter, relying on the Chiefs playmaker to find his form under test-match pressure. Backrower Kieran Read - the World Rugby Player of the Year last season - is sidelined with concussion. But there is a ready-made replacement at No 8 in 31-year-old veteran Jerome Kaino. He will play his first test since the 2011 World Cup final, having spent two years in Japan before returning to New Zealand this year. Lock Luke Romano is out with a broken leg and winger Julian Savea has a knee injury, but New Zealand have strong back-up to rely on. Stretch: New Zealand look determined to extend their unbeaten run at Eden Park on Saturday . Bandaged: Brodie Retallick passes the ball during their training session at Trusts Stadium in New Zealand . ‘There's been a lot of talk in the media about this being a poor England side,’ Hansen said. ‘But when you go through them they've all played internationals in the last 12 months and there are not that many changes from the last time we played them - and that was a great contest. ‘They've clearly got confidence in who they are and what they're doing. Their environment seems to be one of just keeping quiet and get on and do the work, and that makes them dangerous.’ New Zealand are expected to have an advantage due to the sustained pace at which they play the game, and Hansen expects England to counter that with a game based around its forwards and set pieces. Lancaster has tried to liberate England from that dour style but he lacks players with the ability, or even the ambition, to play attractive rugby for long periods. He said England had made the transition from an experienced to a less mature side after the 2011 World Cup, and was now used to playing against more-seasoned opponents, adding ‘experience is not the only barometer of what wins and loses games.’ Focused: New Zealand refuse to fall for the 'poor England side' front and expect a tough match .

"Dressed in floor-length white Dior, Princess Charlene was every inch the royal yummy mummy to be as she stepped out in LA last night. Attending the Princess Grace Awards Gala at the Beverley Wiltshire hotel in Los Angeles, the Monégasque royal looked happy and content, hours after news that she is expecting twins broke. This morning, the Palais Royal in Monaco also officially confirmed news of multiple heirs, issuing a statement that read: . Glowing: Princess Charlene was glamorous in a floor-length white dress as she stepped out in Los Angeles. Here she poses with director Adam Shankman and gala host Jane Lynch . 'The Prince and Princess of Monaco are happy to confirm they are expecting twins at the end of the year.' The Monégasque royal couple are currently in Los Angeles on behalf of the Princess Grace Foundation and have attended several receptions, including last night's event. Charlene, who is six months pregnant, stayed close to husband Prince Albert's side but looked delighted when she was serenaded during dinner by tenors Clifton Murray, Fraser Walters, Remigio Pereira and Victor Micallef during dinner. Celebrity guests at the event included director Adam Shankman and Glee star Jayne Lynch, both of whom posed for photos with the royal couple. Confirmation: The Palais Royal in Monaco has now officially confirmed that twins are on the way for the couple . The doting prince was never far from his pregnant wife's side . The day before, the couple had lunched with another set of A-listers, among them Jerry Bruckeimer, Mel GIbson and Sylvester Stallone, hours after news of twins broke. Charlene, 36, wore a loose-fitting sequinned top and black trousers to the event, which was held in honour of her husband's late mother. Prince Albert kept a protective arm around his former Olympic swimmer wife as he smiled for photos with guests. The high-profile events were both for the Princess Grace Foundation, which awards fellowships and grants to promising up-and-comers in the entertainment industry, including dancers and actors. Albert is the Vice-Chairman on the board of the organisation, and is often in attendance at its events, one of which is an awards ceremony. Serenade: Charlene looked delighted when she was serenaded by a group of tenors during the event . Looking good: Charlene had worn a glamorous sparkly top for a lunchtime reception in LA a day earlier . But for once, all eyes were on Princess Charlene, who, following months of speculation, has confirmed that she will give birth to twins in December. Speculation has now turned to the succession, with pundits left contemplating the question of how the birth of multiple babies might affect the succession. According to Monaco's constitution, the first-born baby is the closest in line to the throne, with priority given to males. In 2002, when Albert was still single, his father Prince Rainier quietly changed Monaco's constitutional laws to allow his daughters, Caroline and Stephanie, and their children to inherit the throne should Albert fail to marry and produce an heir. Charlene, who was born in Zimbabwe and raised in South Africa, married the Monégasque royal in July 2011. In June, Prince Albert told the Associated Press that he and his wife were 'overjoyed', 'thrilled' and 'very excited' about the impending arrival of their child - or children, as they are now known to be. For charity: The high-profile event awards fellowships and grants to promising up-and-comers in the entertainment industry, including dancers and actors. Pictured: Charlene with Mel Gibson . Mini-me: Prince Albert was gifted with a child-sized Hollywood T-shirt for one of his future heirs . Making friends: The royal struck a pose with Twilight actor Taylor Lautner .

Albert, 56, has two other children - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, born in 1992 to American Tamara Rotolo, and Alexandre Coste, born in 2003 to Togolese air hostess, Nicole Coste. Under Monaco's inheritance laws, neither of Prince Albert's two illegitimate children have no claim to royal titles and are not considered his official heirs. His daughter Jazmin was born in California to a former waitress with whom Prince Albert had a brief fling. Now 22, she recently graduated from Fordham University in New York. His son Alexandre, now ten, lives with his mother, a former Air France hostess from Togo, on the French Riviera. Prince Albert reportedly demanded DNA tests for both children before accepting paternity. With an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies, an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - isn't unusual. Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia is one royal parent of twins, who with wife Princess Sophie of Isenberg welcomed Carl Friedrich and Louis Ferdinand in 2013. Another is Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Mary, who became parents to Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine in 2011. Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou is yet another royal father of twins, following the birth of Prince Louis, Duke of Burgundy and Prince Alphonse, Duke of Berry, to his wife María Margarita Vargas Santaella in 2010. But although royal twins are fairly frequent among European dynasties, among them the Monégasque couple, British royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years. Born to King James I of Scotland and his wife Joan Beaufort in 1430, Alexander and James were the first and only twins born to British royal parents. Tragically though, Alexander, the eldest of the two, died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of Scotland as James II. During his marriage to Mary of Guelders, James sired no fewer than seven children, all of them in separate pregnancies. Despite the lack of British royal twins, odds have shortened on another set of royal twins - belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - being announced. While the Monégasque rules of succession are clear, the British rules aren't set in stone, although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares, the question of who inherits what is less vexed. In theory, with Prince George already in the royal nursery, the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role. As for which parent is responsible for the Monégasque royal twins - or the British ones, should they come to pass, Consultant Gynaecologist Dr Andrew Paterson says both could be behind a multiple birth, although the mother is the more likely candidate. ‘Twins are not genetically based,' he explains. 'Monozygotic twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two, creating identical twins. ‘Another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised, creating non identical twins. ‘If either the mother or the father have twins in their family, the chances of them having twins is higher.’ A crown fit for two? Princess Charlene and Prince Albert II of Monaco announced on Tuesday that they expecting twins - which has led many to speculate which baby will inherit the throne . Wedding bells: Charlene, 36, a former Olympic swimmer from South Africa, married Prince Albert in July 2011 . 'The truth is that, I'm sorry to say, Albert hasn’t seen Alexandre since a brief visit last September,' she claimed. 'It has become impossible since he married that girl.' In 2005, Prince Albert said in an interview with Larry King that while Alexandre will never inherit the throne, 'he will be very well taken care of' - presumably financially. While it's rare for a noble figure to have twin heirs, it has happened before - most recently in 2009, when David Cholmondeley, the seventh Marquess of Cholmondeley, welcomed twin boys with his wife Rose Hanbury, a former fashion model 23 years his junior. Born by C-section three months premature, the boys were named Alexander Hugh George and Oliver Timothy George. Older by a few minutes, Alexander is the heir-apparent to the Marquessate and bears the courtesy title Earl of Rocksavage. Oliver is known as Lord Cholmondeley. Succession: In 2002, Prince Rainier changed Monaco's constitutional laws to allow his daughters Caroline (left) and Stephanie (right) and their children to inherit the throne should Albert fail to marry and produce an heir .

"Amelie Mauresmo was discreetly seated a few rows back from Kim Sears, wrapped against the almost wintry chill of the French Open’s first week, as Andy Murray began his Roland Garros campaign with an otherwise forgettable win over a Kazakh named Andrey Golubev. This, it turns out, will go down as the start of another remarkable development in a remarkable career in which the 27-year-old Scot has often shown the propensity to break new ground. After all, he took on Ivan Lendl when the great Czech had minimal coaching experience, and set a trend that many of his rivals would follow for big-name hirings. Appointment: Andy Murray, training on Sunday at Queen's, has appointed Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach . Top job: The two-time Grand Slam winner will take over in time for  Queen's . That ended with the . biggest breakthrough of all, becoming the first British man since Fred . Perry to win the US Open and Wimbledon. Now . he has done it again. Flouting convention, he announced on Sunday — . with the tennis world agog — that Mauresmo would be his new coach for . the grass-court season and almost certainly beyond. With . the Frenchwoman looking on for the Golubev match, it was notable that . Murray was mentally dialled in from the start. He attacked the . first-round tie with the focus that was so often apparent when Lendl . would sit, solemn and emotionless, in his box. 'Excited': Murray said Mauresmo was someone he 'always looked up to and admired' Champ: Mauresmo won Wimbledon in 2006 and the Australian Open in the same year . HELEN . COSTA: Costa became the first female manager of a professional football . club in France after being appointed by Ligue 2 Clermont Foot in May . this year. She had previously managed the women’s national teams of . Qatar and Iran. Clermont player Anthony Lippi said: “It will be a unique . experience... It creates a buzz.” TERESA PHILLIPS: Phillips . made history in 2003 by becoming the first woman to coach a men’s . top-level NCAA basketball team. She took charge of Tennessee State . University’s Tigers for one game when the regular coach was suspended . mid-season. The Tigers lost, and Phillips reverted to her role as the . school’s athletics director. EVA LUND: Swedish curler Lund . won double world and Olympic gold in her playing career. She was . appointed coach of Nicklas Edin’s men’s team for the 2014 Winter . Olympics, where they missed out on a bronze medal in a final stone loss . to Great Britain. Lund said: “If you have a different perspective as a . woman, you bring more value.” MARGOT WELLS: The former . Scottish sprint champion turned to coaching and was never far from . husband Alan’s side as he swept to Olympic gold and silver medals at the . 1980 Moscow Olympics. She still works closely with a number of elite . male rugby union and hockey players. BARBARA WILLIAMS: . Williams became the first female ice hockey coach in the history of the . NHL when she was named power skating instructor for the New York . Islanders in 1977. She worked with the Islanders through four Stanley . Cup wins before moving on to become a skating coach with the New Jersey . Devils. When . Lendl departed the scene in March, Murray quickly worked out that it . would be impossible to find a like-for-like replacement for someone who . had given him that marginal edge which all champions seek. Multiple . Grand Slam winners from the men’s game are few in number, and when you . look for one who is prepared to return to the treadmill of the circuit — . and who is temperamentally suitable — their ranks evaporate altogether. And . so he thought outside the tramlines, as this intelligent and innovative . individual has so often been prepared to do. Why not look at a woman, . and to hell with anyone who might sneer at the notion. That . is what led him to contact 2006 Wimbledon Champion Mauresmo prior to . Roland Garros, as Sportsmail suggested following the Golubev match. Many . in men’s tennis privately look down on the women’s game, but Murray has . never been one of them. He is intrigued by the WTA Tour and, for . example, took to Twitter last week to say how much he had enjoyed . watching the emerging American teenage talent, Taylor Townsend. Of . course it is a well-known part of the Murray narrative that the driving . force in his development was his mother Judy, who has one of the . shrewdest tennis brains you will ever encounter.She . is one of numerous mothers who have had a major impact on bringing . their son through to the professional ranks, with all the commitment . which that takes, and who have retained a significant influence. Previous: Mauresmo already has experience of coaching man, having worked with Michael Llodra . Exit: Murray lost to Rafa Nadal in the semi-finals of the French Open in Paris . Jimmy . Connors’s mother Gloria was another famous example as was Marat Safin’s . mother Rausa. But it is unprecedented in modern times for a player from . the true elite to have a woman from outside the family travelling as a . major part of the team. There . are a couple of current top-100 players who have put their faith in . women as their outright coaches but they are family. One is Uzbekistan’s . Denis Istomin, who is coached by his mother, and the other is the . Russian-Kazakh Mikhail Kukushkin, whose coach is his wife Anastasia. They . will be familiar with the few inconveniences such an arrangement . brings. I remember trying to seek out Istomin the day before Murray . played him at the US Open last year and seeing his mother waiting on a . bench outside the locker room to have a chat as she was obviously not . able to enter. Tonic: Murray will have to recover from the thumping he took at the hands of Nadal . Mauresmo . has experience of what it is like to be a woman in this particular . man’s world. She coached Frenchman Michael Llodra during the 2010 . grass-court season, when he won the Eastbourne ATP event. She . is currently captain of the French Fed Cup team (the opposite number of . Judy Murray with the Great Britain team) and was on the support staff . of Marion Bartoli when she won Wimbledon last year. So . she knows how to win, and can also empathise with the severe pressures . Murray faces in being by far and away the best player in the nation that . hosts Wimbledon. Contact: Mauresmo said the pair had been discussing working together for a few weeks . Long term: Mauresmo suggested the pair would team not just on a short team basis . Mikhail . Kukushkin is coached by his wife, Anastiasa Kukushkina, and Denis . Istomin by his mother, Klaudiya Istomia, while, of high-profile former . players, Gloria Connors was a hugely influential figure in son Jimmy’s . career. Former top-10 player . Andrei Chesnokov was coached by Tatiana Naumko for virtually his whole . career and Billie Jean King briefly coached Tim Mayotte. Despite . winning two other Majors, she found it hard to produce at her home . Grand Slam. The best she managed at Roland Garros was two quarter-final . appearances. She . and Murray have much in common. Away from the court, on which he is . ferociously competitive, Murray is a thoughtful type with a gentle and . sensitive side that would surprise some, and the softly spoken Mauresmo . is similar. You can imagine the two of them being able to communicate . well. On . the technical side she was an unusually fine volleyer among the women . and this is a side of his game that Murray could do with employing more. But . there will undoubtedly be sceptics, and Murray loves nothing more than . proving those wrong. He will want to make this work and unless he finds . the arrangement deeply unsatisfactory early on they clearly plan for it . to continue well beyond Wimbledon. They . actually have  a tough start together. Weary from Roland Garros, Murray . has a very quick turnaround from Paris on to the grass at the Aegon . Championships this week, and then comes his defence of the Wimbledon . title. What a fascinating journey it promises to be. Sportsmail's tennis correspondent Mike Dickson first revealed the possibility of Mauresmo taking over as Murray's coach on May 27.","World No 8 has appointed two-time Grand Slam champion .
Frenchwoman is also a former World No 1 .
Murray has been without a coach since splitting with Ivan Lendl .

"Amber Vinson, who caught Ebola while treating the first patient diagnosed in the U.S., has revealed that her engagement ring was incinerated during the hazmat clean-up. The 29-year-old ICU nurse said on Thursday that the ring, given to her by fiancé Derrick Markray, was destroyed along with the binder where she kept the details and arrangements for her wedding next year. The ring was lost amid many of Miss Vinson's personal possessions at her home in Dallas, Texas, which were burned by hazmat clean-up crews to prevent the spread of Ebola. Scroll down for video . Nurse Amber Vinson, 29, contracted Ebola last month but has since recovered from the virus.  Miss Vinson is due to marry fiancé Derrick Markray (pictured on June 22) next year. Mr Markray is a former college football star who went on to the New Orleans Saints. She admitted that she was crushed when Ebola clean-up crews destroyed her engagement ring (pictured) She told CNN: 'I was crushed. It's a thing, but it has sentimental value to me... We've got to rebuild.' And losing the ring may have been for nothing after infectious disease expert Dr William Schaffner told ABC that some bleach would have killed any trace of the virus which touched the jewelry. The nurse could look on the bright side on Friday, however, after she got a kiss and a hug from former president George W. Bush who visited her and her colleagues. Bush dropped by Texas Health Presbyterian in Dallas where he posed for pictures with dozens of delighted doctors and nurses. Dallas calmly marked the end of its Ebola crisis on Friday, when the last of the 177 people who were being monitored for symptoms of the deadly virus were to be cleared at midnight. Miss Vinson caught Ebola while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan in October at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.

Former President George W Bush warmly greets Amber Vinson at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on Friday. The city calmly marked the end of its Ebola crisis on Friday, when the last of the 177 people who were being monitored for symptoms of the deadly virus were to be cleared at midnight . She said on Thursday that she wasn't careless or a risk-taker and defended her decision to board a flight shortly before being diagnosed. She described her worst days fighting the Ebola virus in a special quarantine unit as a 'blur' where she felt awful and was unsure she would survive. Some have criticized the ICU nurse for her decision to fly from Texas to Ohio on October 10 after she treated Duncan. Nurse Vinson flew to her home state for the weekend to plan for her wedding next year to former college football star Derrick Markray. She told Today on Thursday that she would never have put anyone at risk and  was never told by her ICU management team or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that it was unsafe to travel. The nurse said she was completely healthy and 'felt great' when she landed in Cleveland, Ohio, to visit her mother, Debra Berry. She told People Magazine: 'I hung out with my mom and her dog, and we ordered pizza and relaxed. The next day, I went out to the bridal store with some of my bridesmaids and we had a great time.' Miss Vinson was pictured last month being transferred to Emory hospital in Atlanta, Georgia after being diagnosed with the Ebola virus = . She said that while in Ohio she learned that her fellow ICU nurse, 26-year-old Nina Pham, had contracted Ebola and that the news 'floored her'. Miss Pham worked the day shift caring for Mr Duncan, a Liberian national who had traveled to the U.S. at the end of September, before Miss Vinson took over on the night shift. Miss Vinson said: 'I was afraid for myself, for my family, because I did everything that I was instructed to do, every time, and I felt like, ''If Nina can get it, any one of us could have gotten it.''' Miss Vinson said reports that she had been feeling 'weird' before she boarded her return flight  were 'completely false' and deeply hurtful. She checked her temperature multiple times before boarding the plane and it was normal. 'I never felt ''weird,''' she said on Thursday. 'I felt fine, I felt completely normal.' Due to her concern, Miss Vinson called Texas Health before boarding her return flight and was once again cleared to travel. It was only once she landed in Dallas that she discovered that she had a temperature of 100.3F and reported to the hospital. When her fever became worse and she developed sickness and diarrhea, Miss Vinson said she knew that she had developed Ebola. She told People that her mom was strong but the news deeply-affected her fiancé. ""I was sitting next to Derrick, and I saw one big tear hang from his eye and fall... I rubbed his back and then I turned around and cried,' she told People. Miss Vinson, 29, is pictured above during her Ebola treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. She was declared free of the virus on October 28 . She said her condition initially worsened and that she prayed to God to save her life. But as she began to feel better she was able to contact family and friends via Skype and sent text messages with her colleague Nina. She said reports that she had traveled with Ebola symptoms had left her feeling 'terrible'. 'I'm not careless, I don't take risks. I'm an ICU nurse... I embrace protocol and guidelines because in my line of work it's a matter of life and death,' she said. The nurse admitted that she had not been given thorough training before treating Mr Duncan in the highly contagious stages of the Ebola virus. She described the training to People as 'a crash-course education'. She said: 'We did not get much training. The first time I put on the protective equipment, I was heading in to take care of the patient. We didn't get training in putting on and taking off the equipment... so we could feel comfortable with it.' Miss Vinson said that after treating Mr Duncan, she would dream about work and going over every little detail of her care while continually taking her temperature. The 29-year-old was infected while caring for Mr Duncan who died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas on October 8. She told People that his death left her 'distraught'. She inserted catheters, drew blood, and dealt with Duncan's body fluids, all while wearing protective gear. Ebola is only caught through contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is contagious. Miss Vinson didn't show symptoms before flying to Cleveland, Ohio on October 10. She reported her temperature to the CDC, as part of self-monitoring guidelines, on October 13, and was cleared to fly back to Dallas. The next day, the nurse developed a temperature, and on October 15, she tested positive for Ebola. In Ohio, 163 people were  monitored due to contact or potential contact with Miss Vinson in a bridal shop and on flights. To date, no cases of Ebola have been reported. She was initially treated at her own Dallas hospital before being transferred to a specialized unit at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia. Miss Vinson received blood plasma from Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly. She was declared free of the disease on October 28 and said on Thursday that she is feeling good but gets 'a little tired as the day goes on'. A family friend set up a GoFundMe account which has raised $20,000 for Miss Vinson. The nurse said that she would absolutely treat someone with Ebola again as it is her duty to take care of anyone that she sees is suffering. Her colleague Nina Pham, 26, who also was infected with Ebola was released on October 24 from the National Institutes of Health in Maryland after being declared virus-free.","The 29-year-old ICU nurse said the ring, given to her by fiancé Derrick Markray, was destroyed to prevent the spread of Ebola .

"The number of EU migrants registering to work in Britain has soared by 55 per cent since 2010, but David Cameron has been warned a plan to cap the numbers would be illegal. In the last year, National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed. Number 10 is considering a plan to impose a limit on the numbers available to workers from individual countries, but today there were fresh warnings the idea would break European law. Scroll down for video . National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed . Spain, Romania, Greece and Italy have seen the biggest increases in NINOs in the last six years, according to official government figures . Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today on a visit to a Ford factory in Dagenham, insisted the British people are 'the boss' not Brussels . Mr Cameron is under growing pressure to announce a radical new approach to tackle soaring immigration from Europe. The Prime Minister has promised it will form the centrepiece of his plan to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. Senior Conservatives are considering a proposal to impose quote on 'time-limited national insurance numbers' to limit the numbers of people able to move to Britain for work. Mr Cameron promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands, but the figure has topped 200,000 after a surge in the numbers using freedom of movement laws to move from elsewhere in the EU. Latest figures show that since 2010 the number of EU workers registering for a National Insurance number (NINO) has risen by 55 per cent, while for those outside the EU the figure has fallen by 48 per cent to 420,000. The biggest increases in the last four years are from Romania (up 272 per cent), Greece (244 per cent), Spain (172 per cent), Italy (151 per cent), Portugal (137 per cent) and Cyprus (112 per cent). A senior Tory minister told MailOnline: 'The problem isn't just the new countries like Romania and Bulgaria, it is people coming from countries like Spain, Italy and Greece because they can't get work at home. 'We need to be able to show that we can do something about that.' Today Mr Cameron said: ''What we need in Britain is a renegotiation of our relationship with the European Union and a referendum where the British people decide whether to stay in this reformed organisation or do we leave it. 'Now that's what I will pursue, that's what I will deliver and at the heart of that renegotiation we need to address people's concerns about immigration. 'I'm very clear about who the boss is, about who I answer to and it is the British people. They want this issue fixed, they're not being unreasonable about it. I will fix it.' The most NINO handed out last year were to Poles, Romanians and Spaniards, the data reveals . The biggest increases have been from EU countries, with controls on immigration from other countries leading to drops in NINO registrations . Home Secretary Theresa May is already in talks with the German, Dutch and Austrian governments about tackling immigration across the EU. Downing Street insists Mr Cameron will set out his plans in 'due course'. The PM's official spokesman said today: 'If you look at countries around Europe, governments are looking at the impact of immigration. 'The Prime Minister has for some time raised his concerns. Freedom of movement cannot be an unqualified principle of the European Union. 'Do we need change? Clearly we do. We believe that there will be treaty change.' However, the idea of imposing quotes on the number of people moving to Britain from elsewhere in the EU has been roundly criticised. Outgoing European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso yesterday warned restricting migrant numbers would 'not be in conformity with European laws'. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It almost definitely is illegal, but there is a bigger issue of principle. 'It was Britain that promoted the single market in Europe. It was Mrs Thatcher biggest negotiating achievement. 'There're roughly the same amount of British people who leave and go to the rest of Europe as come here, and the ones who come here are overwhelmingly younger people, workers, and people who make a net positive contribution to the British budget.' Bruno Macaes, secretary of state for European affairs in the Portuguese government, also said attempts to limit people from across the EU moving to Britain by capping the number of national insurance numbers for foreign workers would be illegal. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Yes, it seems that it goes not only against the directive that we have but against the treaty. Why? Because it is limiting the numbers in absolute terms and that is not allowed.' Tory MP Bernard Jenkin also said the plan would break existing EU law, but suggested it would still be a good idea. He added: 'I very much welcome people like Boris Johnson and the Prime Minister less explicitly saying that we do need to move to a quota system for EU migrants, simply because when we first joined the European Economic Community, as they were then, there were two fundamental differences. 'First of all, the free movement principle was very undeveloped and we only had eight countries in the European Union.' Mr Jenkin said he could not see 'any other way that we can obtain the new relationship the Prime Minister wants us to have' without taking such action or quitting the EU. Katja Hall, CBI Deputy Director-General, said: 'Businesses recognise that free movement of workers within the EU is a sensitive issue but are clear that it is an essential part of the single market. 'It boosts the attraction of investing in the UK, creates jobs and offers firms here real benefits in working with our biggest trading partners.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage accused Mr Cameron of deceiving voters with his promise to reform the UK's relationship with the EU. Ukip leader Nigel Farage, pictured today on a visit to the National Emergency Services Museum in Sheffield, accuse Mr Cameron of deceiving voters . Speaking during a visit to the National Emergency Services Museum in Sheffield, Mr Farage said: 'Mr Cameron has been saying to people 'we can have our cake and eat it'. We can't. He's actually been deceiving the British public.' He continued: 'What is a fact is you cannot do what Mr Cameron is pretending to do and remain a member of the European Union. 'I think we're looking at a man who is desperate to save his own skin, who knows that if he loses the Rochester by-election to Ukip there may well be 46 backbenchers who put in letters demanding a leadership election and desperate people do desperate things. He's thrown the rule book out of the window, he's thrown the fact that actually he's supported free movement of people his whole political career, that's gone too, and this is just about survival but it's not going to work because what he's said is not true.' Mr Farage said: 'Mr Barroso was absolutely right and his successor Mr Juncker will say the same thing. 'It is one of the fundamental cornerstones of the European Union that you have the free movement of people. Now the error was letting in 10 former communist countries, countries in which case millions of people are very, very poor and they see the UK as a good place to come to. 'I don't blame them for doing it but the truth is you can't change that without completely changing the treaty. In fact, the reality is the only way to get back your border control from Brussels is to leave the European Union and have a simple trade deal instead.'","Prime Minister insists the British people are 'the boss' not Brussels .

"Louis van Gaal has been criticised by the Dutch fitness coach who branded David Moyes a ‘dinosaur’ after Robin Van Persie suffered a tight groin during Holland’s friendly with Wales. Raymond Verheijen, who has worked at clubs across Europe, said Van Gaal’s programme of two training sessions per day had increased the chance of muscle injuries. Van Persie came off at half-time of the 2-0 win in the Amsterdam Arena and is being checked by the team doctor with Holland’s first World Cup game against Spain just a week away.

"Naming Downton Abbey's beloved Labrador after the goddess Isis seemed like a good idea at the time. But there are claims the pet could be on her way out - after she was dogged by comparisons to the brutal wave of Islamist violence of the same name. Tonight's episode raises questions for the first time over Isis' health as she approaches a grand old age of between eight and ten, or 56 to 70 in dog years. Are the dog days over? The Earl of Grantham's dog Isis (above) appears unwell in tonight's episode of Downton . Cora Crawley, the Countess of Grantham, is seen looking at a morose-looking pet splayed on the ground and remarks: 'She’s terribly listless. I don’t know that she hasn’t picked up a germ.' Lady Mary Crawley adds: 'She’ll have eaten a dead squirrel or something equally foul'. Hugh Bonneville's Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham, then chimes in and says he will have the pet looked at by a vet. To most it would seem like an innocuous point of conversation. Critics and devoted fans, of course, know the ITV drama's writers seldom raise a topic for no reason. Isis made her first appearance in the period drama in its second series in 2011, replacing the earl's previous pet Pharaoh. Famous rear: The Labrador's predecessor Pharaoh makes a star appearance in the show's opening credits . As the first series tailed off in 1914 and the second began in 1916, Isis - now appearing in 1924 - is likely to be between eight and ten years old, hardly immune to the ills of old age. The yellow Labrador was named after the Egyptian goddess Isis, whose name means 'throne' and became one of the most important deities of ancient Egypt. But the name prompted grim comparisons after the rise of militants branding themselves Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - also known as IS and ISIL. One Downton fan account, Lady Mary's Eyebrows, tweeted: 'Is there a TV dog more unfortunately named than Downton's Isis?' Jasper Goodheart said: 'You're gonna have to somehow change the name of the dog, Downton . Not sure Isis is currently a world favorite.' Faithful companion: Isis has been with a Crawleys for a decade after the demise of her predecessor Pharaoh (left), but in tonight's episode Cora the Countess of Grantham (right) remarks on her possible ill health . Daily Mail feature writer Guy Adams chimed in: 'I fear that recent events in the Middle East have rendered the name of Lord Grantham's dog Isis deeply inappropriate.' ITV has insisted the whole issue is a coincidence, adding that most of the current series was filmed before fans began pointing out the similarity in names. The broadcaster does not comment on future plot twists, but a spokesman said: 'Isis has been the Crawley's family pet since Series 2 (2011) and was named after the Egyptian Goddess. 'Series 1 saw the family pet Pharaoh, with the same themed name. 'At the time the dog was named and up to and including the majority of filming of Series 5, no one was using that acronym to describe a terror group. It is an unfortunate coincidence.’ Many things other than the dog are named after the Egyptian goddess - including a U.S. metal band, a range of Ann Summers underwear, Oxford's student magazine and the International Student Internship Scheme.","Labrador named after Egyptian goddess long before Middle East militants .

"Guy Brudenell (pictured) used the Sugar Daddy website to contact 'hundreds of women' and cheated his victims out of a total of £66,000 . A disgraced businessman who had affairs with women he met through dating websites and charmed them into handing over tens of thousands of pounds has been jailed. Guy Brudenell, 44, who used the Sugar Daddy website to contact 'hundreds of women', told elaborate lies to cheat his victims out of a total of £66,000. The conman spent the money on a luxury lifestyle, which included an exclusive apartment, massages, health and beauty treatments, topless dancers, a trip to the Monaco Grand Prix, a stay in a top London hotel and shopping sprees at upmarket department stores. He lived in a £1.3million country mansion in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, with its own cricket pitch, tennis court, greenhouses, summerhouse, cottage and terrace on its 7.62 acres. Nick Dry, prosecuting, told Teeside Crown Court that, to persuade his victims to hand over money, Brudenell told one woman who he had sex with that he had bowel cancer, and dropped another when he realised she did not have more money to give him. One of the women Brudenell had an affair with and who tracked him down to his house and confronted him, told Judge Harold Crowson in a victim impact statement: 'I feel sexually violated by him. 'It frightens me there are such terribly dishonest people out there.' Another said: 'Guy Brudenell has had a horrible detrimental effect on my life and still does to this day.' One family was left so poor they had difficulty visiting their teenage daughter who was seriously ill in hospital. In their victim impact statement, the family said: 'He knew our situation and continued to take our money. He even hassled me for money on the morning he was sentenced.' Others had to spend tens of thousands of pounds and come close to bankruptcy to sort out the mess he left them in. He contacted many of the women through the Sugar Daddy website, which aims to pair up women and wealthy men. The court heard how he was a renowned Yorkshire businessman before the economic crash but was declared bankrupt in 2009 and jailed in 2013 for fraud. Teeside Crown Court heard the former businessman also operated a building company illegally, defrauding people over house improvements, and arranged for the home of one of its clients to be turned into a brothel while its owners were on holiday. Luxury lifestyle: The former home of Guy Brudenell, in Nawton near Helmsley, North Yorkshire, which he put up for sale after declaring himself bankrupt in 2009 . Tracked down by North Yorkshire Police and brought to court to face justice for a £1.24 million series of frauds on business friends, he persuaded Judge Harold Crowson to grant him bail so he could 'put his affairs in order'. But he continued to commit his crimes while on bail. Sentencing him for the second time in just over a year, Judge Crowson told him: 'Your every act appears to have been calculated to fund the lifestyle you saw as your entitlement. 'I don't think any sentence I can impose will truly reflect the harm you have caused.' Brudenell pleaded guilty to eight charges of fraud including one of defrauding the trustee overseeing his bankruptcy, one of creating a forged email which he used in one of the frauds, one of fraudulent trading and one of breaching bankruptcy restrictions by operating Hampton Rock building company. Many of the offences were committed while on bail. Guy Brudenell jailed last June after pleading guilty to fraud and perjury at Teesside Crown Court. The court heard that when he hit hard times Brudenell conned three acquaintances out of £1.24 million to service mounting debts and pay for a £15,000 Swiss skiing holiday and a trip to St Tropez, the court heard at the time. He persuaded them to part with £600,000, £400,000 and £240,000 with the promise of quick profits on deals to buy repossessed houses. As a respected figure in North Yorkshire high society, with interests in two leading hotels and a successful business past, no one doubted him until it was too late. Lavish: Guy Brudenell, whose former home boasted a full size cricket pitch and village style pavillion, swindled his business colleagues who thought he was a successful tycoon . He lived in a country mansion with its own cricket pitch, travelled by private helicopter and enjoyed holidays in some of the world's most glamorous hotspots. But behind the scenes he was using 'ever more desperate, and ultimately criminal, measures in his bid to stay afloat,' prosecutors said. His empire eventually collapsed around him as he declared himself bankrupt with £21million debts in 2009. Brudenell was forced to put his £1.3m home in Nawton, North Yorkshire, on the market. His 2005 marriage to wife Pennita - who arrived at their wedding in a Cinderella-style glass carriage - ended in divorce. And soon police were probing his financial affairs. One of his victims went to police who uncovered a 'web of lies, deception and fraud.' Altogether the frauds totalled £141,000, £66,000 of which he conned out of the women he befriended and others and £75,000 from the Hampton Rock fraud. Judge Crowson added: 'All of it (was) going on a lavish lifestyle - something those victims can never have dreamt of.' Brudenell was jailed for three years and eight months, to be served after the five years and four months Judge Crowson gave him in June 2013 for the £1.24 million frauds, giving a total of nine years. He was given a ten-year financial reporting order under which he must tell police all about his financial and business affairs anywhere in the world and any changes in his name or permanent address every six months. His barrister Alasdair Campbell said: 'There is little mitigation in respect of each offence which I can offer.' He said of the 'hundreds of women' contacted by Brudenell through the Sugar Daddy website, four had said he had defrauded them. The court heard how Guy Brudenell (pictured) was a renowned Yorkshire businessman before the economic crash but was declared bankrupt in 2009 and jailed in 2013 for fraud . Brudenell lived in a country mansion with a luxury interior including this open-plan kitchen . Speaking after Brudenell was jailed on Friday, Detective Inspector Ian Wills who heads North Yorkshire Police's Financial Investigation Unit, said: 'Brudenell is a predatory fraudster who views every encounter and meeting as an opportunity to commit fraud. He has targeted people indiscriminately for many years. 'The evidence revealed that he regularly lied to family, friends and business associates about his need for funds and how they were to be applied. 'Between 2009-13 he was a prolific user of a dating website where he targeted women for sex and money. 'He was latterly offering bogus investment deals with the payments offsetting previous debt and funding his lifestyle. His offending continued up to the very morning he was imprisoned in June 2013. 'The tactics Brudenell used to delay repayment were callous, claiming to some that his girlfriend had cancer and latterly that he himself had bowel cancer. 'As in the previous case, he was also forging emails to encourage investment or delay repayment - all whilst on bail for similar matters. 'The sentence today should send a clear message to those who seek to deceive others.'","Guy Brudenell, 44, charmed women into handing over thousands of pounds .

"New signing Steve Sidwell admits manager Mark Hughes was a significant factor in him choosing to agree a two-year deal with Stoke. The 31-year-old was signed by the Welshman at former club Fulham and when the Cottagers released the midfielder following their Premier League relegation he was immediately a target for Hughes.

All smiles: Steve Sidwell poses after signing for Stoke on a two-year deal . Saying goodbye: Sidwell applauds the fans after Fulham's final home game of last season . 'I was really impressed with the football Stoke played last season; the way they played against Fulham on the penultimate weekend of the season really had a wow factor about it and it led to a first-ever top-10 finish in the Premier League. 'Then there's the manager because he's a man that I have the highest regard for. 'He signed me for Fulham and I really enjoyed the time I worked with him there. 'I like the way he asks his teams to play and his training sessions are good, which makes coming into work on a daily basis really enjoyable. 'I'm really looking forward to the start of pre-season. I've had a holiday and feel really refreshed and ready for an exciting new phase of my career.' Reunion: Mark Hughes was a factor in Steve Sidwell's move after signing the midfielder while at Fulham . Sidwell will officially join on July 1, following Sunderland defender Phil Bardsley in completing a summer move to the Britannia Stadium. ""Steve was much in demand following his release by Fulham and we are delighted to have won the race to secure his signature,"" said chief executive Tony Scholes. ""Mark Hughes signed him for Fulham and from talking to Steve I know how much he's looking forward to working with him again.

"This time were no dramatic tears from Luis Suarez. The Liverpool striker wasn’t even on the field, left idle by a knee injury that is clearly worse than England ever hoped. Make no mistake about it, though, this was another night to rip the heart out of the Uruguayan. First the Barclays Premier League title slipped from his grasp on that awful night at Crystal Palace. Now his World Cup looks as though it may stall before it's even begun. On another dramatic evening in this beguiling World Cup, Uruguay and Suarez were stunned by a team that weren’t even supposed to figure in Group D.

Goals: Campbell 54, Duarte 57Referee:Felix BrychAttendance: 58,679Star man: Oscar Duarte . Costa Rica were ambitious, energetic and brave. Inspired by young Arsenal forward Joel Campbell, they got exactly what they deserved and it is clear that they will move forwards to face Italy and then England fearing absolutely no-one. A goal down to an early Edinson Cavani penalty, Costa Rica prefaced the start of the second half with a group huddle. Afterwards, coach Jorge Luis Pinto talked of his team's 'emotional serenity'. Whatever was said clearly worked as Pinto’s team were so superior to Uruguay for the second 45 minutes it was quite startling. Goals from inspirational young Arsenal striker Campbell and then from the superb Oscar Duarte and late substitute Marcos Urena left Uruguay reeling and significantly Suarez was not brought on, even as his team started to chase the game. Suarez is clearly not fit and there has to be huge question mark now over his participation against England.To make matters worse, right back Maxi Pereira was sent off in injury time for a dreadful hack at young Campbell near the corner flag. He will miss the England game, too. Head boy: Oscar Duarte (left) scores to make it 2-1 to Costa Rica before celebrating (below, left) Oscar Duarte . Afterwards Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez was contradictory when he provided his now customary update on Suarez’s state of health. 'Suarez is fit,' he said. 'If he wasn’t he wouldn’t have been on the bench. He has gone through the phases we have foreseen and we will see what happens now. 'We have four days before the England game so we will see if there is a possibility he may play.' Without the prolific Suarez, Uruguay still looked to have more than enough to hurt unfancied central American opponents. Indeed, things went to plan for most of the first half. Cavani did miss a good chance early on, slashing wildly at a volley when unmarked, but he soon recovered to despatch  a penalty when his captain Diego Lugano was dragged down by Junior Diaz. Briefly Uruguay looked set to take firm control of the game. Maybe they would have had Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas not produced the save of the World Cup so far to touch over a heavily deflected shot from Forlan just before half-time. Can't believe it: Luis Suarez (right) was an unused substitute as Uruguay crashed to defeat . Just before the break, however, there . were some signs that Costa Rica had something to offer. Campbell drove a . shot inches wide from distance while Giancarlo Gonzalez almost nudged . home a corner at the far post. As the game wore on, so Uruguay's susceptibility at aerial set pieces became clear. Afterwards, Pinto revealed he had identified it in the build-up. Certainly, Uruguay suffered in the second half. The equaliser arrived soon after half-time. The build-up down the right was nice enough but the cross was rather hopeful. Only when two Uruguay defenders got in each other's way did it become an opportunity and Campbell lashed the ball home from 12 yards with his right foot. Level best: Joel Campbell (centre) scores to equalise for Costa Rica against Uruguay . Comeback trail: Joel Campbell celebrates scoring Costa Rica's first goal . With so long left in the game, the goal seemed to represent nothing more than a curiosity. Uruguay had plenty of time to gather themselves and come again. As it turned out, the opposite happened in front of 58,000 increasingly frenzied supporters at the Estadio Castelao. It was Costa Rica who grew in strength and again Uruguay were found out in the air as Duarte escaped the rather slack attentions of Cristhian Stuani at the far post to stoop bravely and head across goal in to the far corner. Uruguay immediately made two substitutions but Suarez was not among them. Briefly they rallied, Cavani bringing a save from Navas with a header.

"Apple fans may need to wait even longer to get their hands, or wrists, on the tech giant's upcoming smartwatch. Despite initial reports claiming it would go on sale in February 2015, a leaked statement - made to Apple employees - suggests the release has been delayed until 'the spring.' According to 9to5Mac, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores said: 'We’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.' Scroll down for video . Despite reports claiming the watch (pictured with boss Tim Cook) would launch in February, a statement suggests it has been delayed until 'spring.' Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores said: 'We’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring' Apple's chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. He didn't announce exactly when the watch would be available, but said it would go on sale 'early next year.' A 'source close to Apple' told The Information last month that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. Chinese New Year falls on 19 February next year, so Ms Ahrendts comments push it at least beyond this date. Despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. The telling omission suggests the watch’s battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it eventually does go on sale. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year. Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world. 'One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.' The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. A source said Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’ Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. Although he didn't reveal battery life details, Mr Cook did spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging .

A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year. Like many of Apple’s other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use. Another concern is the launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed .

"Anyone who knows Roy Hodgson will tell you that  England’s head coach is a lovely guy. Charming fella, brilliant  company, great stories. Frankly, that doesn’t make you the man to remain in the most prestigious football job in this country.  This is a resignation issue. England are as good as out of a World Cup after two group games. It is a modern-day football scandal. We thought that wretched 4-1 defeat against Germany in Bloemfontein four years ago was bad. Somehow, this was even worse.

Time to learn: Pele thinks Roy Hodgson can 'review what went wrong and come back stronger' Dejected: England were knocked out of the World Cup in dismal fashion in a tough Group D . VIDEO Hodgson needs Italian miracle . Don’t allow anyone from the FA, the England team or the management to brainwash you in the coming days about this squad being in development and everything going according to plan. Poppycock. Next stop is Russia and after that Qatar, where FA chairman Greg Dyke has set the national team the target of winning the tournament.  Not going to happen out there, Greg. How about we set out to win the tournament at hand with the country’s best players available playing in the best positions and worry about the big picture another time? Wayne Rooney told us that this was the best England team he has ever been involved with and we’re meant to keep a straight face. Consoled: England's tormentor Luis Suarez talks to captain Steven Gerrard . Flashback: England's 4-1 defeat by Germany in 2010 was an all-time low at a World Cup . Everybody knows that five-year plans, master plans and FA inquiries keep people who shouldn’t be in high profile positions in high profile positions. This effort really is shameful.  We have been looking forward to a World Cup in Brazil for an entire lifetime and the chances are that we will never be back here again before we meet our  makers. Think about that for a moment. With the exception of holding the tournament in England, playing the World Cup here is as close as it gets to footballing utopia.  Instead, after our final group game against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte next week, the chances are that the squad will be on the first flight out of here. It is incredible to think that captain Steven Gerrard and Hodgson told us that there were no special plans in place to stop one of the world’s leading strikers. Is this for real? Were they being serious? It cannot be so. Say it ain’t so. Undercooked: Hodgson's side couldn't handle the heat against Italy and Uruguay in testing conditions .

Embrace: Hodgson (right) talks to Uruguay head coach Oscar Tabarez before the game in Sao Paulo . Every man jack around this camp over the past few days knew how much it would mean for Suarez to  bully  England out of the tournament. Well he has just done it. England’s defence was embarrassing, unable to cope at the elite level against Italy and now Uruguay.  Until we understand what it means for the South Americans to slip on that jersey and belt out the national anthems we will never stand a chance on this continent and  neither will our coach. You can bang on about technique and tactics as much as you like, but you have to understand that these South American kids are off the streets. They play from the heart. It is different for them, it really is. Beating England is better than anything, just talk to them for a few minutes and you understand that and be wowed by it. Did we really think England could turn up in Sao Paulo, where Uruguay forward Nicolas Lodeiro plays his club football with Corinthians, and get away with it? Not on your life. Tormentor: Luis Suarez was the star of the show as Uruguay beat England in Sao Paulo . Heart breaker: Suarez scored his second and the winner for Uruguay with five minutes to play . Great debate: The decision on where to play Wayne Rooney, if at all, gave Hodgson a big headache . Like most managers at the highest level, Hodgson cracked at the crucial moment in the build-up to the World Cup. It gets to them all. Four years ago his predecessor Fabio Capello lost the plot when he attempted to bring Paul Scholes out of international retirement and messed about with the England captaincy. By the time the Capello Index was unveiled on the eve of the tournament in South Africa, team spirit had been blown to bits. Euro 2012, when Hodgson was parachuted in to replace Capello, was meant to be the head coach’s free pass in his first tournament. We would judge him at the World Cup — and let’s not start rewriting history with some baloney about the young players benefiting from tournament experience.  Whatever you make of England and these two defeats here, please don’t buy that argument. Hodgson got carried away with the idea that a young team could cope with tournament conditions in a difficult, but beautiful, country. To the future: Raheem Sterling is one of a number of young players England possess . Perhaps he believed, when  England drew 2-2 in the Maracana last June against Brazil, that his defence would be good enough at the World Cup.  He called that wrong because Glen Johnson, Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines were in the team that afternoon. Surely Hodgson, with all his experience at international level, would know other teams don’t take friendlies anywhere near as seriously as we do. A 2-2 draw for Brazil is chicken feed compared to when the World Cup comes around. When it does, the top players — Neymar, Balotelli, Pirlo and Suarez — come alive. That is why they are in the elite bracket. Over the coming days there will be many mea culpas and lots of people from the FA pretending that all is well with the world. Well actually, no it’s not.","England are on the brink of being eliminated from World Cup 2014 after losing to Uruguay 2-1 .

"Group B kicks off on Friday night. The perceived wisdom is that Spain and Holland will prevail.

The heat is on: Holland boss Louis van Gaal is under pressure to make sure his side get out of the group . New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal could well face humiliation if he doesn’t take the Dutch to the knockout phase. Chile’s coach Jorge Sampaoli promotes a high tempo, pressing, passing game that sees his team evolve from 3-3-1-3 to 4-3-3 in the blink of an eye. Looking to shock: Arturo Vidal and Alexis Sanchez hope to help Chile progress from their group . Chile who should give Australia a bloody nose on Friday are a team to watch if they don’t suffer stage fright like Colombia in 1994.

Part of the ticket will be to strip Qatar of the 2022 finals and cleanse FIFA of a brown paper envelope ethos. The FA want England to take over those finals. And despite denials have a strong chance not least because of cost. FA chairman Greg Dyke now sees that as his raison d’etre. Football's coming home? FA Chairman Greg Dyke is keen to bring the 2022 World Cup to England if there is a re-vote . But it understood that Australia would be the politically pragmatic choice. I understand China and India will also make new bids, if - and it will happen - there is a new vote for the 2022 finals. I’m looking forward to seeing Tim Cahill – remember him? - in action for the Socceroos. I reckon the ex-Millwall and Everton star, now with New York Red Bulls, could make an impact even if the Aussies eventually are overcome by chirpy Chile.

Reports that Roger Milla, now perhaps aged 65-and-a-half, at least, will make a comeback this summer after his exploits at Italia 90 have been grossly exaggerated, . However don’t dismiss the notion that the spring chicken that is Samuel Eto’o might still make an impact this summer for Cameroon. And if Eto'o does notch - maybe against Mexico - then he must, please, pay homage to Milla and dance by the corner flag. Play it again Sam.

Accompaniments: . *Courtesy of www.healthyeating.co.uk . Food for thought: . With Mexico playing on Friday night, here is a an easy fajitas recipe . Method . Turn on oven to 200 degree celsius and wrap the tortillas in tin foil. Finely slice the chicken pieces and onion and pepper. Mix these together in a bowl and then add the marinade ingredients in the listed order. Heat a griddle pan until hot and put the tortillas in the oven wrapped in the foil. Add contents of the mixing bowl to the pan and keep them moving over a high heat using tongs so you get a nice charring effect. Check the chicken is cooked all the way through and there are no raw parts. The idea is to get chicken that is still moist but charred on the outside, which requires the pan to be very hot. Once cooked tip the pan contents into a large bowl and serve with the heated tortillas (they should have been in the oven around 8 mins), salad and salsa. Wine or Beer? Wine:Chile vs Australia: .

"Before repelling Brazil in the biggest shop window of all, Mexico keeper Guillermo Ochoa expressed a preference to remain in Ligue 1 and to play in the Champions League. But Barclays Premier League clubs will have sat up and noticed the 28-year-old as he helped Mexico to their second clean sheet of the World Cup in the 0-0 draw in Fortaleza. Man-of-the-match Ochoa is a free agent after his contract with relegated AC Ajaccio expired, but he will surely be snapped up soon after his four sensational saves denied Neymar (twice), Paulinho and Thiago Silva. VIDEO Ochoa brilliance denies Brazil . Announcing himself on the world stage: Guillermo Ochoa made a string of incredible saves as Mexico held Brazil . Goalbound header: Neymar connects with Dani Alves' cross as his thumping effort heads for the bottom corner . Breathtaking: Ochoa flies through the air to deny Neymar . He recently told L'Equipe: 'My priority is to stay in France, but I am open to any propositions. I have improved in the last three years, most notably in handling the pace of games. 'But I was used to top competition when I played in Mexico. I now need to play in the Champions League to be sure of my level.' On the basis of his performance, he appears to have it all. A commanding presence behind Mexico's excellent defence, Ochoa displayed lightning reactions and the agility of a cat whenever called upon. Heroes: While Ochoa deservedly took the plaudits, Mexico were outstanding . A commanding presence: Ochoa took charge of his area and kept out all that Brazil could throw at him . Jorge Campos was famed for his garish jerseys and ability to score rather than his ability between the sticks. He played in both the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, winning 130 caps for his country. Brazil striker Fred, who disappointed once again, called Ochoa's saves 'four miracles'. The man himself simply said: 'It was the game of my life.' He first drew gasps with a moment which has already been compared to 'the greatest save of all': Gordon Banks' astonishing effort to thwart Pele 44 years ago. Dani . Alves found space on the right and whipped in the perfect cross for the . latest incumbent of Brazil's iconic No 10 shirt. He connected with the . ball beautifully, sending a seemingly goalbound header to the bottom . left corner. But there was Ochoa, leaping and extending a strong right arm to keep the ball out. He was called into action again just . before the break. As Paulinho and David Luiz bore down on goal, he . showed immense bravery to deny the Spurs man with another reflex save. In the right place at the right time: Ochoa thwarts Paulinho (left) He's at it again: Ochoa showed lighting fast reactions to deny Thiago Silva from close range . With Mexico playing expansive football and going toe-to-toe with Brazil in a pulsating second half, Ochoa once again denied Neymar. He controlled substitute Bernard's cross beautifully, looked up and fired a fixxing left-foot effort towards goal. To his disbelief, Ochoa was there again. His night did not end there. Thiago Silva looked odds-on to give Brazil all three points as he rose to meet Neymar's free-kick in the 86th minute. But Ochoa's hands were once again strong and the ball went out for a corner. Brazi looked on in disbelief and will be relieved to have seen the back of Ochoa. But will the likes of Oscar, WIllian and Ramires come face-to-face with the curly haired fellow from Guadalajara once again? Ochoa was in a similar vein of form for Ajaccio when they faced Paris Saint-Germain in the second week of Ligue 1 last season.","Ochoa was magnificent as Mexico held Brazil to a 0-0 draw in Fortaleza .

"The wreck of a 253-foot British-built steamship that sank to the bottom of Lake Ontario off the coast of western New York after colliding with another vessel nearly 90 years ago has now been found. The four-man team from the area of Rochester, New York, Ohio and Texas said it found the wreck of the Nisbet Grammer in more than 500 feet of water about eight miles off Somerset, 40 miles west of Rochester. The ship was carrying a cargo of grain from Buffalo to Montreal when it collided with the steamship Dalwarnic in dense fog early on the morning of May 31, 1926. Scroll down for video . Remember the Nisbet: This undated photo provided by James Kennard shows the Nesbit Grammer on the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada. The ship sank in May 1926 after colliding with another steamship on Lake Ontario off western New York shore . Collision course: A Great Lakes Historical Society's photo of the steamship Dalwarnic, which struck the Nisbet Grammer in a dense fog in 1926. The Grammer filled with water and sank in Lake Ontario . First look: In August 2014, nearly 90 years after the sinking, a team of explorers discovered the vessel in 500 feet of water . Record-breaking disaster: The ship was the largest steel steamer to have sunk in Lake Ontario . The stricken ship sank in less than 15 minutes, but all aboard were saved by the crew from the other steamer. A six-year search for the sunken ship ended in August when the team's side-scan sonar detected the wreck, said Jim Kennard, of Fairport, according to Shipwreck World. The other team members are Roland Stevens, of Pultneyville, New York; Craig Hampton, of Lorain, Ohio; and former Rochester resident Dan Scoville, who lives in Houston. The Nisbet Grammer, named for one of its Buffalo-based owners, was launched from a shipyard in England in 1926. It was known as a 'canaller' - a type of steamship used to transport grain, coal and other products through Ontario's Welland Canal to ports on lakes Erie and Ontario. Hard labor: It took shipwreck explorers six years to locate the badly corroded Grammer . Silver lining: Everyone aboard the stricken steamer escaped the shipwreck unharmed . The ship was the largest steel steamer to have sunk in Lake Ontario, Kennard said. The team surveyed more than 80 square miles of lake bottom until finding the wreck site in late August, he said. A remotely operated vehicle was used to obtain video of the shipwreck and identify it as the Nisbet Grammer, Kennard said. The steel bulk freighter Nisbet Grammer was built in Birkenhead, England, by Cammell Laird & Co and launched on April 14, 1923. On the morning of May 31, 1926, the coal-powered cargo steamship was transporting a load of grain from Port Colburne in Buffalo to Montreal when a dense fog descended on the calm lake, significantly reducing visibility. The Grammer reduced its speed by half as a precaution, down to 4.5 knots. At around 5.30am, the crew aboard the steamer heard the sound of a fog horn, and a few minutes later the Dalwarnic came into view directly in front of the cargo ship. The crew on the British-built boat rushed to turn it to starboard in a desperate bid to prevent a collision, but there was not enough time. The crash took place off Thirty Mile Point in Lake Ontario. High tech search: A remotely operated vehicle was used to obtain video of the shipwreck and identify it as the Nisbet Grammer . On a mission: The team of shipwreck explores (from left to right) Jim Kennard, Roland Stevens, Craig Hampton and Dan Scoville, who found the Nisbet Grammer in August . Less than 15 minutes after the Delwarnic plowed into the Grammer, the hull of the stricken ship filled with water and the boat sank to the bottom of the lake, making it the largest steel steamer shipwreck. Dalwarnic had just been sold by Canadian government to Canada Atlantic Transit Co and was making the trip to the new owners. A formal investigation into the disaster found that the crews on both steamers made errors due to poor visibility.

"She shot to fame as Hugo Taylor's petite model girlfriend on Made In Chelsea and while she was a lot more reserved than the rest of the E4 cast, Natalie Joel is making headlines now. Natalie has designed a brand new swimwear collection called Joel Swimwear - and showcases her incredibly toned body as she models a selection of pieces. The range is described by the professional model and designer as a premium beachwear label dedicated to sexy, elegant and feminine bikinis. Scroll down for video . New range: Natalie Joel, who shot to fame as Hugo Taylor's girlfriend on Made In Chelsea, has unveiled her debut swimwear collection . Speaking to MailOnline about her new range, the petite star said: 'Swimwear has always been a huge part of my life. I have been an avid collector since my early teens and having had a career as a swimwear and lingerie model has given me such a passion and enthusiasm for design in this field. 'I have always enjoyed the feminine form and feel very privileged that I can help women express themselves on the beach and by the pool. I am also very proud to say Joel Swimwear is a British brand. We are very lucky to have our garments produced in England and also having the campaign shot on an English beach.' Natalie, 23, has drawn on her cultural heritage and says that she's infused the glamour and richness of the Mediterranean with her British passion for the highest possible design craft. 'I have countless sources of inspiration: inspiring people, art, architecture, literature, history, travel, London - I try and put as much of that into my work as I can,' she said. 'Joel is about been elegant and sexy. I love the challenge. It is such a tiny piece of fabric that you have to make an impact; creativity is key.' Professional poser: Natalie works as a model, which is obvious from her latest beach-themed bikini shoot . The debut collection, which is priced at around £140 per two-piece, has seven different colourways and she hopes the 'effortlessly sexy' shape of her designs will become iconic. The designer, who knows how to accentuate her assets, has made sure her bikini bottoms have been cut in a Brazilian style to emphasise the female form, she explains. Natalie says her range  is all about supporting a healthy and positive feminine mind and body. 'Strong and confident girls run the world now! I love Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman. They are both fearless and inspirational. If you can dream it do it. It's this attitude that I bring to my design and my own life,' she said. Desribing her own style and how it has matured since her Made In Chelsea days, Natalie said: 'I feel that my own style is a combination of elegance and sexiness. I am not afraid to express myself. Having said that I adore comfortable and well made clothes so I am just as happy in a Balmain dress as I am in well fitted jeans and chunky knitwear. 'I am only 5’2 so I must always be careful to dress correctly so suit my proportions. I am more adventurous now. I was so shy when I was filming MIC and I naturally wore a lot of black. Nowadays I love expressing myself as my confidence has grown.' Research: Natalie says that she  analysed hundreds of different colour combinations to find the correct balance to suit a wide variety of skin tones ensuring that clients feel 'happy and effortlessly beautiful at all times' Enviable curves: Natalie showcases her honed physique as she reclines on a beach in the steamy shoot . The star showcases an enviably toned physique in the campaign imagery, so what's her secret? 'I love going to work out classes with my girlfriends and cousins,' she revealed. 'We like to act silly and enjoy our workout in a happy way. I think that’s the best way. Funky Bums, Tums and thighs is a personal favourite. Food wise, I try to eat little and often. My diet focuses on fresh and seasonal produce. I am slightly panicking though as I recently discovered Cronuts. Avoiding them is a real show of restraint. If you have ever tried one, girls, you will know what I mean! 'I try not to deprive myself of anything I am craving though, I think it's important to treat yourself on occasion.' Natalie joined the show in series three as 26-year-old Hugo's girlfriend. The pair broke up in June but were seen a few weeks later kissing outside trendy hotspot, The Chiltern Firehouse. Speaking about the Taylor Morris sunglasses designer, she said: 'He adores my range. We have a little bet on to see which will be the best seller. As usual, he always thinks he is correct.' So will the young designer be gracing our screens again any time soon? 'Right now I am so content with life. I have been given a wonderful opportunity to express my creativity and also demonstrate my business skill. 'If MIC came back around I would never say never but having a fashion start up takes a lot of time and focus.'

"Hosts Brazil opened the World Cup with a 3-1 victory over Croatia with poster boy Neymar bagging a brace - before Oscar rounded off the win with a toe-poked finish. The technique is used mostly for mere tap-ins but there have been some outrageous and unusual goals scored via a toe-poke down the years. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at five of the best toe-poke finishes... plus we've added in David Nugent's debut goal for England just for good measure. VIDEO Scroll down to watch five of the best toe-poke finishes ever... plus David Nugent . Toe-poke: Oscar scores Brazil's final goal in a 3-1 win against Croatia in the World Cup opener . Happy: Oscar (left) celebrates with Chelsea and Brazil team-mate Ramires (right) after his goal . 1) David Narey, SCOTLAND v Brazil (June 18, 1982) The World Cup reached Spain in 1982 and Scotland arrived with a fantastic squad. They came up against a magnificent Brazilian team, however, and looked certain to struggle. Yet David Narey produced a moment of magic when he toe-poked the ball from the edge of the area. Brazilian legend Socrates later argued it was not a toe-poke, but whatever it was - it was certainly memorable. Original: Dave Narey also scored a toe-poke at the World Cup, for Scotland against Brazil in 1982 . 2) Ronaldo, BRAZIL v Turkey (June 3, 2002) He inspired his nation in 2002 and ultimately won them the World Cup trophy. Ronaldo scored some spectacular goals in his career, and this one against Turkey was certainly up there with the best. After weaving inside, he improvised by poking the ball into the far corner from the edge of the area. Brazilian magic at its very best. Class: Ronaldo improvises with a finish for Brazil to score against Turkey at the 2002 World Cup . Number one: Ronaldo (right) runs off in celebration with Rivaldo (left) following him . 3) Fernando Torres, CHELSEA v Newcastle (August 25, 2012) Torres has seriously struggled at Chelsea since his £50million move from Liverpool but there have been flashes of the old magic there. This finish against Newcastle United in the Premier League optimises what makes Torres so special. Eden Hazard crossed the ball to Torres won ran on to it and smashed it with a toe-poke past Tim Krul. Bullet. Finish: Fernando Torres scores for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge against Newcastle in the Premier League . 4) Ronaldinho, BARCELONA v Chelsea (March 7, 2005) At his best Ronaldinho was simply a marvel to behold. In the Champions League in 2005 he lit up Stamford Bridge with a marvellous double against Chelsea. For the first of those goals he picked the ball up over 20 yards out, dummied a group of defenders before poking the ball into the bottom left-hand corner. Simply breathtaking. Peach: Ronaldinho toe-pokes the ball from the edge of the area to score for Barcelona against Chelsea . Look at me: Ronaldinho celebrates after his goal against Chelsea by running off and pointing to himself . 5) Sergio Aguero, MANCHESTER CITY v Norwich (December 3, 2011) This Argentinian just loves scoring, and Norwich City were his victims on this occasion. Crowded inside the box with several defenders, it looked impossible to score. But after jinking from side to side he prodded the ball home. Great improvisation. Roar: Sergio Aguero celebrates putting Manchester City ahead against Norwich City . AND... David Nugent, England v Andorra (March 28, 2007) This list would not be complete without Nugent's (sort of) memorable strike for England against Andorra. With the visitors already leading 2-0, Jermaine Defoe slotted the ball past the goalkeeper and the ball was trickling towards the line. The ball was already half-way over the line, but Nugent opportunistically ran over and toe-poked it in... just to make sure. An absolute screamer.

"Some scientists suspect that speaking and making tools share the same neurological pathways, because our ancestors learned both skills at the same time. To test this theory modern man will be taught to make Stone Age hand axes, which were developed 500,000 years ago. It aims to investigate the role of stone tools in human brain evolution, especially the key areas of the brain related to language. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists at Emory University in Georgia, Atlanta will train 20 people for 100 hours each so they can learn the art of knapping. This technique was used in the Stone Age to craft tools like hand axes (shown). It was used by our ancestors 500,000 years ago and involves stroking a piece of flint with a quartzite ‘hammerstone’ Archaeologists at Emory University in Georgia, Atlanta will train 20 people for 100 hours each so they can learn the art of knapping. Knapping was used by our ancestors and involves striking a piece of flint with a quartzite 'hammerstone' to break and shape flint. Dr Dietrich Stout, who is leading the experiment, will use MRI scans to monitor the link between tool making and language. He believes that our brain approaches physical tasks, such as making a tool, in the same way it approaches language, reports Wired. Participants in the study will undergo an MRI scan when they listen to a story to show how language activates their brains. They will then have more MRI scans while they are learning knapping to see whether the process of tool making - bashing one rock against another to create the desired shape - activates the same areas of the brain as forming sentences. It is hard for scientists to say precisely when humans started making tools because the more primitive remains look like a natural object rather than a human artefact. The oldest-known instruments are the Oldowan stone tools from Ethiopia, which date back about 2.6 million years. The Acheulean tool technology period - up to 1.76 million years ago - featured large stone hand axes made from flint and quartzite. Towards the end of this period, the tools became more refined and then followed the so-called Levallois technique, which saw the creation of scrapers, slicers, needled and flattened needles. About 50,000 years ago more refined and specialised flint tools were made and used by Neanderthals and it is believed it was at this stage tools were constructed out of bone. As human culture advanced, artefacts such as fish hooks, buttons and bone needles were used. Dr Dietrich Stout (pictured), who is leading the experiment, will use MRI scans to monitor the link between tool making and language. He thinks similar areas of the brain may be responsible for both. His team are looking for volunteers to take part in the study . The Acheulean tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - featured large stone hand axes (stock image shown) made from flint and quartzite. However, it is hard to know precisely when humans started making tools in history . The experts will also run a battery of other tests to investigate the effect, such as eye tracking, memory tests and video analysis of the act of tool making. Participants will range in age from 18 to 50 years old and must be right-handed, with no history of neurological illness - or of making Stone Age tools. 'We need novices who will really commit to learning this prehistoric craft,' Dr Stout said in a blog post from Emory University, where people can sign up for the study. They say the ideal candidates need to be 'curious about who we are as humans and where we came from.' It is apparently the first neuroscientific study of real-world craft skill acquisition over time, according to Dr Stout. Last month Tel-Aviv based designers re-imagined the tool from 1.4 million years ago. The Man Made project used 3D scanning and printing to create different handles and grips. Pictured is one of the designs, a hand-held grip that could be placed in the palm of either the left or right hand to modify a classic hand axe .","Archaeologists at Emory University in Georgia, Atlanta will train 20 people for 100 hours each so they can learn the art of knapping .

"Paul Scholes may be at the centre of a row involving Wayne Rooney but you wouldn't know it from looking at him. The Manchester United legend was all smiles during a club promotional event in the Philippines on Friday and seemingly looked like he didn't have a care in the world. That's despite the fact the 39-year-old was criticized by Rooney on Thursday for claiming the England striker was a fading force who faces being dropped for the World Cup. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney in super slo-mo action during England training . No worries: Paul Scholes was all smiles during a Manchester United promotional event . Rooney hit back at critic Scholes after ending his eight-month England goal drought - insisting he is fit and hungry to play in Saturday’s final World Cup warm-up game against Honduras. But Rooney has pointed out that his former Manchester United team-mate has been little more than a peripheral figure at the club recently - only returning to the coaching staff when Ryan Giggs was made caretaker boss in April. ‘He’s been a team-mate but he’s been . away from the first team for a long time,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve seen a lot . of people saying he’s coached me and been around the team but he . hasn’t. Angered: Wayne Rooney (centre) has hit back at criticism from Manchester United legend Paul Scholes . ‘I’m not really going to react. I’m not interested. He’s got his opinions so let’s leave it at that. To be honest I’m not really interested in what anyone else has got to say. ‘I’m interested in what Roy Hodgson and the coaching staff here and the people around me say. People have their opinions but I don’t agree with them.’ Scholes’ comments opened a debate which . was fuelled when Roy Hodgson decided to play Rooney on the left wing . against Ecuador on Wednesday. Doubt: Scholes (left) has questioned whether Rooney is still the force he used to be . Rooney, who missed the end of the Barclays Premier League season with a groin problem, is the only outfield player to start both of  England’s warm-up games. He scored their opener in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador in Miami, his first international goal since October. ‘I can play in different  positions,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve proved I can play on the left over the years. The manager didn’t have to tell me what to do. I know how to play that role. I’ve played it many times and I’ve no problem doing that. He didn’t have to explain it to me. ‘It is down to the manager. It’s not about me, it’s about the team. If the manager wants to play me up top, in behind, left, right, I’m happy to do that. ‘I’m ready to play. I hope to play against Honduras. I’ve trained hard, I have no  injuries or any recurrence of the groin strain I had at the end of the season. ‘I always needed game time. I felt really good, especially in the heat. I’m sure the  manager will have a tough decision but I’m ready.’ Together: Scholes (left) and Rooney have been team-mate for both England and United . Opener: Wayne Rooney (right) scores England's first goal against Ecuador on Wednesday . Rooney and Daniel Sturridge may need to refine their partnership if they are to play in tandem, as they did in the 3-0 win against Peru on Saturday. But the Manchester United striker pointed out: ‘I think in every game we’ve played together, one of us has scored.’ His facts are slightly skewed. The strikers have scored five between them in seven appearances together. Sturridge, rested against Ecuador, has scored in his last two England games — against Denmark and Peru. Rooney said: ‘Daniel’s a fantastic player. He can score goals from anywhere, like he did at Wembley. ‘We have trained a lot together so hopefully we can take that form into the tournament.’ Wide boy: Rooney (left) played on the left of midfield against Ecuador . Dangerous duo: Daniel Sturridge and Rooney have scored five goals in seven appearances together . David Moyes yesterday added his voice to those calling for Rooney to start in the World Cup. The former United manager said: ‘He has to play. He has the ability to score, he has the mental strength to handle the games. In those games you look to your big players and Wayne will be a big player for England. ‘But there is an awful lot of pressure being lumped on him, which isn’t right. England haven’t done particularly well in a lot of competitions, so no one should be expecting great things from them. 'To be a stand-out and make a difference in World Cup games is very hard. For me, Wayne would definitely start. He has the experience of past tournaments.’ In charge: England boss Roy Hodgson must decide where is best to play Rooney against Italy . ‘I think he is in a better place than he was this time last year. ‘He is playing well and his form has been good and I do think he has already come out and said he wants to have a good World Cup - you have to trust him and go with that. ‘He will be determined to do well. He knows how important this is for him. Wayne will be desperate to show everyone what he can do. ‘In his mind, he is strong and he will be determined to go out and show how good he is, with a determination to do the job. But you have to remember that the opposition can make it difficult for players as well. ‘He will also need good service and good players around him. Wayne cannot make it happen all on his own.’ Backing: Former Manchester United boss David Moyes has called for Rooney to start at the World Cup .","Paul Scholes all smiles during a Manchester United promotional event .

"Iran defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2-0 in a World Cup warm-up on Sunday played on a training ground that was empty apart from a few journalists. Ehsan Haji Safi scored late in the first half and Dutch-born Reza Ghoochannejhad, who plays for Championship side Charlton Athletic, added a goal early in the second. Iran dominated on a windswept field in northeast Sao Paulo, with about two dozen media looking on at the practice facility where the Iranians have been working out. Tidy finish: Reza Ghoochannejhad made it 2-0 to Iran, slotting past Trinidad keeper Jan Micahel Williams . Preparation: The Charlton striker is congratulated by his teammates after scoring in the training ground friendly . Haji Safi put Iran ahead in the second minute of first-half stoppage time after Trinidad failed to clear a corner kick by Fulham's Ashkan Dejagah. Ghoochannejhad doubled the lead from about 10 yards about five minutes into the second half. Javad Nekounam's penalty kick early in the second half was saved by goalkeeper Jan Michael Williams after Dejagah was fouled in the penalty area.

"It was billed as one of Britain's cheapest house, a three-bedroom home with a spacious living room and kitchen, put on the market with a starting price of just £1. Estate agents predicted the house in South Terrace in Newcastle would appeal to property developers and was likely to generate a lot of interest. And the experts were proved right as the house sold for almost 20,000 times more than its starting price and was bought for £19,125 after an exciting auction. The dilapidated property, complete with broken windows, missing floorboards, peeling walls and a garden buried under a sea of weeds and discarded tools, generated a lot of interest. Cupboards have been left discarded in the mid-terrace house which will need a lot of work done before it is possible to recoup its value . The large bay window of the property in Newcastle was seen as one of its key features as buyers battled to get the house at auction . It was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder after eager buyers battled it out to get the bargain mid-terrace house which had been listed for £1 because there were no initial reserve bids. Before the sale predicted the right person with experience of redevelopment could get themselves a bargain. The new house will certainly be a project as it needs extensive work done to most of the rooms to make them habitable. Plaster on walls in the bathroom has come off, while the bath has been pulled out and left lying on its side.  In another room flooring has been torn up and all the windows have been boarded up. However the property does have a number of redeeming features - including an impressive fireplace and large bay window. It is estimated that once the property has been developed inside it could be rented for £340 to £370 a month - netting the owner around £4,000 a year in rental income. The house in South Terrace in Newcastle was originally listed for £1 at auction because there were no reserve bids in for the property . The garden is barely visible under a mess of weeds, rubbish and discarded garden tools at the property in South Bank Terrace . Uprooted flooring, broken carpets and furniture as well as peeling wallpaper and boarded windows feature throughout the property . A developer will need to do a lot of work to restore the doors and the bathroom (right) which has a bath lying on its side on the floor . Anthony Farrow, a valuer at Michael Poole estate agents, poses in front of the house which was put on the market for just one pound . The marble fireplace is one of the key features of the property which experts think could attract interest from future buyers and renters . Richard Francis, principle auctioneer at Agents Property Auction (APA), which sold the house, said: 'it needs work, but it has so much potential'. The home was described as having a spacious entrance hall, living room, kitchen and bathroom/WC to the ground floor, along with three good sized bedrooms to the first floor. The house, which had broken door frames and a patched up front door, until recently appeared to have one tenant - a robin. And people looking inside it have had to take careful steps around debris, broken doors and falling plaster. However the house is not alone in fetching a price based on its potential. This week a shed in a patch of scrubland in Chelsea in London sold for £550,000 - despite not being accessible by car and tucked behind a row of terraced houses.","One of Britain's cheapest ever homes was sold for £19,125 after being listed at a starting price for auction of just £1 .

"A man who was declared clinically dead for 40 minutes was brought back to life thanks to a machine which performed life-saving chest compressions. Colin Fiedler, 39, from Dandenong, in Victoria, Australia, was pronounced dead at The Alfred Hospital last June after he suffered a heart attack. But thanks to a revolutionary cardiac support machine, called the AutoPulse, staff were able to revive him. Life-saver: The Zoll Auto-Pulse keeps blood and oxygen flowing to vital organs . He told the Herald Sun: 'I am so grateful, more than I could ever say'. The Zoll AutoPulse, which is battery operated, is a portable heart and lung pump which keeps blood and oxygen flowing to vital organs. A patient's head, shoulders and upper back lie against a board while a band, which carries out chest compressions, is strapped around the person's entire rib cage. When the patient is strapped in and the start button is pressed, the band pulls tight around the chest and constricts the entire rib cage, rhythmically pumping the heart at a rate of 80 compressions per minute. Manuel chest compressions, even when done well, only provide between 10 and 20 per cent of normal blood flow to the heart and 30 to 40 per cent to the brain. But this new pump moves more blood more consistently, according to experts. A patient's head, shoulders and upper back lie against a board while a band, which carries out chest compressions, is strapped around the person's entire rib cage . The Herald Sun reports that Fiedler is one of seven cardiac arrest patients in Australia who have been treated with the band. Three have been revived from being declared clinically dead for 40 to 60 minutes, it said. AutoPulse machines have been on the market since 2003 and are being used more and more around the world. Zoll, the company which makes the device, said: 'Victims receive more consistent, high-quality compressions than those delivered by simple automated CPR devices, which means improved blood flow.' The U.S. National Centre for Biotechnology Information said a recent study on the effectiveness of the machine showed that it had a 'promising' future. Twenty nine patients who took part in the study received more blood pressure than they would have with manual compressions. In 2010, Arun Bhasin, 53, was found lying unconscious in Croydon after suffering a cardiac arrest. Doctors hooked him up to a Zoll AutoPulse pump which maintained Mr Bhasin's heartbeat for more than three hours while he was stablised by medics. At the time, Nigel Raghunath, lead consultant in A&E, who treated Mr Bhasin said he had never seen such a remarkable case in his 15 years in Accident and Emergency care. He said: 'Even a fully-trained professional finds it hard to deliver consistent, high quality chest compressions when attempting to resuscitate someone whose heart has stopped beating. 'A&E teams have a range of equipment available but the new device means we can carry on helping someone’s heart to beat for much longer improving blood flow to vital organs and increasing their chances of recovery.'","Colin Fiedler was brought back to life by a device called the AutoPulse .

"A Queensland mother says her daughter has miraculously survived a 17-day ordeal lost in rugged bushland where she lived on creek water, small fish and insects. Deidre Sharrock says a farmer found her 30-year-old daughter Shannon Leah Fraser when she stumbled out of the bush on Wednesday morning.

"It is years since he was in charge of the party, but Paddy Ashdown took the lead as the Lib Dems enjoyed their conference singalong. With a beer in hand, the Lib Dem grandee joined members as they sang songs taking a pop at their party’s ‘crazy’ ministers and ‘hazy’ policies.

"A far north Queensland woman who miraculously survived 17 days in rugged bushland says she was given the strength to carry on when a voice at an old Aboriginal burial ground told her 'only you can do it.' Shannon Fraser made headlines when she stumbled naked out of the bush earlier this month after becoming lost at a popular swimming spot in Queensland's far north on September 21. She lost 16 kilograms during the ordeal, surviving only on dirty creek water, she was severely burnt from sun exposure and covered in cuts and scratches. The mother-of-three has opened up about the experience, which she says was 'agony.' Scroll down for video . Shannon Leah Fraser (right) survived 17 days in bushland after becoming lost at a popular swimming spot in Queensland's far north on September 21. She says the thought of her children gave her the will to push through the 'agony' of the experience . 'It was torture,' she told New Idea magazine. Ms Fraser become lost while visiting Golden Hole, south of Cairns, with her partner and a friend and unknowingly walked further into dense rainforest when she tried to retrace her steps. As the days wore on she was bitten by relentless march flies, scratched by wait-a-while vines and plagued by thirst and hunger. The mother, from nearby Innisfail, spent days wading through croc-infested waters and it's understood she sat in the waters for three days to soothe her cuts and burns. As she began to weaken, she drew strength from the knowledge her children, aged 15, 11 and nine, were waiting for her at home. On day 16 - just as she had given up hope - she neared an old Aboriginal burial ground and heard a voice say: 'Only you can do it'. A short time later she came across ribbons left by searchers which guided her to a spot just 30 metres from where she went missing. The 30-year-old was last seen at the Golden Hole swimming spot, south of Cairns . She was treated in hospital for third degree burns and underwent surgery to remove splinters from her feet and legs. She also suffered insect bites, numerous welts, cuts and bruises. Ms Fraser described the moment when she finally got to hold her children as 'like hitting the jackpot'. Her brother, Dylan Fraser, told the Courier Mail that  his sister looked like 'Biggest Loser meets Bear Grylls' when she emerged from the bushland. 'She's lost lots of weight, she's covered in cuts and scratches, but she's in good spirits,' he said when she was found. Shannon Leah Fraser (right) with her mother, Deidre Sharrock, lost 16kgs during her 16-days lost in the bush . The former cancer patient's 11-year-old daughter Takirah, told the Courier Mail that her former 90kg mother 'looks way skinnier, but she's in a lot of pain', adding that she was ecstatic Ms Fraser was alive. Ms Fraser's disappearance sparked a huge search in which emergency crews spent 800 hours scouring the area. Her incredible tale of survival triggered doubts, with police even saying they were confident the extensive search would have located her and that she had likely travelled outside the search area. There were suspicions she might have met with foul play, and her mother made a public appeal for information. Police have said they aren't taking any action against Ms Fraser after speaking to her days after she emerged from the bush. Ms Fraser says she heard a voice at an old Aboriginal burial ground on the 16th day, telling her 'only you can do it.' Ms Fraser says the voice gave her the strength to carry on .","Shannon Leah Fraser survived 17 torturous days in Queensland bushland .

"Stuart Hogg hasn’t had his troubles to seek over the past few months. First, the talented full-back was sent-off against Wales during the Six Nations earlier this year before then falling out of favour at Glasgow Warriors to such an extent that he wasn’t even in their squad for the Pro12 Final against Leinster. Question-marks were inevitably raised over his attitude and focus, with rumours of a big-money move to Ulster unhelpful to say the least at the business end of the domestic season. Yet, as is so often the case in sport, one moment of brilliance on the field of play can pave the way for a brighter future off the park. Scotland winger Tim Visser, back on international duty after breaking his leg, powers through for his try . On Saturday night — local time — Hogg made a mockery of the searing heat and humidity of Houston to issue a timely reminder of his talent in Vern Cotter’s first match in charge of Scotland. With 13 minutes left of the Scots’ first match of their summer tour, against the USA, the 21-year-old from Hawick took a high ball 50 metres out. Lesser players would have kicked for touch or played it inside to a team-mate to conserve energy in the 30 degree heat and 84 per cent humidity. Not many would have attempted to run the length of the pitch in such testing conditions. With team-mate Tim Visser shouting at him to ‘run into the space’, Hogg took off — leaving the stunned and tired Americans in his wake. And, after the 21-times capped full-back touched down, the sweet release of frustration from the Scot was palpable. Scotland full-back Stuart Hogg taunts the Eagles fans after his solo try . ‘I kept running and running but I felt I was going nowhere, like I was being pulled back with an anchor because it was so hot and humid out there,’ said Hogg, nursing a broken nose that makes him a doubt for the match against Canada in Toronto next Saturday. ‘You may not believe me but give me the rain and wind of Scotstoun over those conditions in Houston any day. ‘When I did manage to get to the line, I think you saw what the try meant to me. ‘After what I have been through to be back on the pitch, to score a try and to be part of a winning Scotland team was a great feeling. ‘It had been a tough time for me because, if I am honest, what happened in Wales when I got sent off (after an unnecessary shoulder charge on Dan Biggar) knackered my whole season. ‘I won’t be doing that again in a hurry because I let a lot of people down in that game but I’m trying hard to get them all back on my side now. ‘It has been a frustrating time but I am settled at Glasgow and unless you are aware of something I am not, then I will definitely be at the Warriors next season.’ Scotland centre Duncan Taylor is tackled by fly-half Shalom Suniula as Eagles captain Todd clever is sent flying . Although Scotland should have won by a greater margin, the fact they were never in trouble defensively would have pleased their new head coach, Cotter. Apart from Hogg’s moment of brilliance, the four new caps — openside Blair Cowan, stand-off Finn Russell and props Alex Allan and Gordon Reid — played well and gave hope for the future. The most assured was certainly 21-year-old Russell, who only broke into the Glasgow Warriors team after Christmas. How Visser could have done with some of his young team-mate’s composure. The winger hadn’t played for Scotland since breaking his leg last October and although he scored one very good try off a Greig Laidlaw pass, he could have had more. Three times, he fluffed his lines — fumbling what should have been a scoring pass from Cowan, dropping the ball over the line on another occasion before then taking the wrong option when put in by Russell. Thankfully, those missed opportunities did not come back to haunt the Scots in a match which will be remembered for being Cotter’s first game in charge, if little else. Stuart Hogg prepares to set of on a run from deep in his own half . In truth, the crowd of 21,000 — many of them ex-pats Scots — never had much to shout about. Yet, there was a real intensity about Scotland’s early play. Cotter, in first pre-match address, must have really got them fired up in the dressing room as they didn’t give the USA a second on the ball before a massive tackle would come in. Early on, it was Reid, Jim Hamilton and Alasdair Strokosch who were fulfilling the role of enforcer as the poor Americans were stuck in their own half for long periods. Scotland had taken the lead through Greig Laidlaw’s second penalty, after his first effort had hit the upright, and never looked like losing it. Chris Wyles, the USA full-back, did draw the scores level after Johnnie Beattie was penalised only for Scotland to then grab their first try of the match. Nice one, mate: Visser (left) celebrates his try with team-mate Sean Lamont . It was a simple affair with Laidlaw running round the ruck undefended before popping a pass to Visser, who ran in between the posts. The Scotland captain put over the conversion. There was little free-flowing rugby being played because the Scots knew that they had the better of the USA at the scrum and kept resorting to it whenever possible. The tactic paid off when, around the 30-minute mark, Scotland had a series of scrums on the opposition line only for the home side to continually collapse them. The patience of French referee Pascale Gauzere finally snapped and, after sending American prop Olive Kilifi to the sin bin, he awarded a penalty try. Laidlaw once again put over the conversion. Moments later, in their first attack, USA captain Todd Clever thought he had gone over but the TMO deemed he had taken two movements before touching down. Replays suggested it had been a harsh decision, however. Downer: Scotland's Jim Hamilton is carried off the pitch after picking up an ankle injury . Ordinarily, to go in 17-3 at the break away from home would have been a cause for celebration but the points difference should have much more. Against a better nation, the opportunities missed by players such as Visser would have come back to haunt Scotland. In the second half, the Americans did enjoy more possession and territory but never got near the Scotland try line. The only points they got once again came from the boot of Wyles, who put over a penalty. With the result a foregone conclusion, the intensity of the match faded in the heat and humidity, with mistakes creeping into the play of both sides. Win: Scotland debutants (left to right) Alex Allan, Finn Russell, Gordon Reid and Blair Cowan celebrate . Scotland looked tired and it was no surprise when Cotter made a string of substitutions on the hour mark, although even these changes didn’t spark the game into life. It took Hogg’s lung-busting run up the touchline to bring the Houston crowd to their feet. For the American fans, this was what rugby was all about. A brave full-back running from deep to score a wonderful try. It certainly brightened up a dull last 10 minutes and the fact that the match ended with Russell dropping the ball and kicking it away in frustration summed up the general quality of play by both sides. By the same token, the win for Cotter means that, here in Houston, we have lift-off on his time in charge of Scotland. Next up is Canada in Toronto, who are likely to provide a much tougher test.

"Click here for Sportsmail's brilliant World Cup Match Zone . Russia: TBA . South Korea: TBA . Host commentator . Russia take on Belgium next in Group H, they're going to have to improve to trouble Marc Wilmots side. King Capello though, eh? Meanwhile, South Korea take on Algeria. That's all from me tonight, I hope you enjoyed the coverage here. All over here, I'm thankful the second half improved! The heat made it difficult to play with a quick tempo, but both teams seemed content with a draw. Igor Akinfeev's mistake will live long in the memory... 90+4mins: All over? Kokorin gets in down the left and plays the ball across the six yard box, but Samedov slices it wide at the back post. 90mins: Russia in the ascendancy, they have been much more positive in the last 20 minutes or so. Four minutes added on. 85mins: Just five minutes left here, and you have to say it's been an entertaining second half. I guess anything would be considered exciting after those first 45 minutes though! Can either team nick a crucial winner? 79mins: What now? This game has certainly livened up. Unbelievable! Russia equalise immediately. They look so much better with two up front, and Kerzhakov capitalises after a goalmouth scramble. Four years ago Capello had to watch on as Rob Green dropped a clanger for England against USA. I think this ones worse... 71mins: Fabio Capello going for it now, on comes another striker. Dear. Oh. Dear. This is one of the worst goalkeeping howlers you will ever see. And I'm sorry Igor Akinfeev, but this game needed it. Substitute Lee Keun-Ho shoots speculatively from 30 yards, straight at the Russian goalkeeper, who practically throws it into his own net. Really, just... awful. 66mins: Superb ball in from Kombarov from the left, and to be fair to South Korea's goalkeeper he deals with this one well, pucnhing the ball clear. 62mins: Few players dropping with cramp at the moment. Me too lads, me too... 58mins: On comes the Alan Dzagoev, the top scorer from Euro 2012 as a youngster. Dubbed as the next Andrei Arshavin, can he inspire Russia here? 56mins: Off goes the former Arsenal striker, who just like his days in the Premier League, was ineffective tonight. 50mins: This half is much more promising. Ki hits a swerving shot from long range and Akinfeev only just parries on the second attempt. 48mins: Another harsh booking here, this time for a Russian player. Oleg Shatov is slightly late, but I reckon that was his first foul. 46mins: Great start to the second half from Russia. Faizulin has a shot tipped over the bar before Berezoutski nods a header into the side netting. No goals at the break then... we haven't seen a goal since around 6pm (BST). South Korea had the best chances in that half and but for some wayward finishing would be in front. Capello needs to install some belief into his Russia side, they surely need to go for it. 43mins: Looks like we're going to be goalless at half-time. Players trying to pace themselves in this 80 degree humidity. 38mins: What a chance this is for Son Hueng-Min yet again. he dances into the box and creates space to shoot but blazes it miles over the bar. A complete shank. 34mins: Another long range shot, this time from Son Heung-Min, the shot is deflected and with Akinfeev rooted, would have found the net had it been on target. Just wide, though. 33mins: Better from Russia. Kokoring feeds Zhirkov on the left-hand side who drives towards the box. He elects to shoot but gets all wrong, kicking the ground and it's a goal kick. 30mins: Another harsh booking for South Korea, for what seemed to be a 50/50. The resulting free-kick is blasted towards goal by Faizulin and the ball has to be beaten away by the goalkeeper. 27mins: At the moment Russia are only looking dangerous from corners. Jung Sung-Ryong just about manages to claw the latest set-piece away. Dare I say it, this game needs a goal... 22mins: I mentioned earlier that Russia were the favourites for this, especially after South Korea lost to Ghana 4-0 in their final warm-up game. But the Asian side are holding their own, with the Russians crying out for some invention. 17mins: Not impressed by Russia at all so far. It's slow, steady and they're lacking creativity. Dare I say it reminds me of England in 2010? 13mins: We saw a lenient referee earlier on, but this is ridiculous. Son Heung-Min is booked, but he barely touched Aleksandr Samedov, who made the most of it. 10mins: More lovely play from South Korea! A fabulous touh from Koo Ja-Choel sets up Heung-Min, but he is a bit selfish and goes for goal himself from the edge of the box instead of laying it off to Chung Yung. He eventually blasts his shot over the bar. 8mins: Decent bit of movement from Son Heung-Min, who dances past a couple of challenges. Russia have had a corner early on but little threat other than that - they seem to be lacking pace on the wing. 4mins: Russia looking to force the pace early on, but South Korea have already shown some technical quality on the ball. Bolton's Lee Chung-Yong is one to look out for, and he will look to get some joy against an aging defence. Away we go! Surely not another 0-0 draw? Let's hope for an entertaining game. Look out for Aleksandr Kokorin for Russia tonight, the 23-year-old has a fine record in his home country. It is their first World Cup appearance since 2002, coincidentally the year South Korea made the semi-finals... Son Heung-Min is the danger man for them, and he is partnered up front by former Arsenal flop Park Chu-Young. Russia have only kept one clean sheet in their last six World Cup games, it was against Tunisia on June 5, 2002 (2-0). This is South Korea’s eighth World Cup in a row (since 1986); only Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina and Spain can boast a longer streak currently. South Korea have only won two of their last 10 World Cup games (against Togo in 2006 and Greece in 2010). The one previous meeting between Russia and South Korea came in a friendly in November 2013; Fabio Capello’s side won 2-1. Including games played as Soviet Union, Russia have lost seven of their last 10 World Cup games, winning the other three. South Korea have kicked off each of the last three World Cups with a win: v Poland in 2002, Togo in 2006 and Greece in 2010. South Korea have scored the most direct free-kicks in the World Cup since 1990 (5).Aleksandr Kokorin was the youngest player to score 10 or more goals in the Russian Premier League in 2013-14; he was born in March 1991. South Korea captain Koo Ja-cheol said 'I don't know the (Russian) names themselves. But I know their numbers.' Rewind four years ago, and Fabio Capello was slammed in the press after a poor performance in South Africa with England. Can he make up for it with his Russia side tonight? They qualified convincingly and will be the slight favourites for this one. Never rule out the South Koreans though... Sung-Ryong; Suk-Young, Young-Gwon, Lee-Yong, Jeong-Ho; Ja-Cheol, K.Young, Sun-Yueng, Chung-Yong; Chu-Young, Heung-Min .

"Much maligned former Manchester City striker Jo is finally fulfilling his potential – six years after the £18million move which was marked him out as one of the world’s hottest prospects. His eventual inevitable return back to Brazil looked to take the then-shaggy haired towering but clumsy frontman out of the spotlight, but now he could be leading the line for the five-time World Cup winners in his home country - complete with a new, more sensible haircut. Arriving as Mark Hughes’ first signing as manager, Jo was an early sign for City fans that their new-found blank chequebook could not necessarily buy success. Flop: Brazilian Jo signed for Manchester City in 2008 in an £18m deal but struggled to make an impact . Goal brought: Jo struck just 11 times at City and was shipped out on loan to Everton in his second season . Revival: Yet Jo will likely make an come off the bench for hosts Brazil in the World Cup opener against Croatia . The Brazilian centre-forward arrived from CSKA Moscow with the objective of being the star striker to lead a new blue era, but the reality was not so pretty. He managed just 11 goals during his time at the Etihad – with five of those coming against small sides in the League Cup and Europa League. A loan spell at Everton sandwiched between two seasons in sky blue was not hugely successful either, producing just two goals: against 10-man AEK Athens in the Europa League and soon-to-be relegated Hull City in the Carling Cup. Second chance: Jo was sent out to Everton on loan from City but scored just twice for the Toffees . International: Jo has now played for Luis Felipe Scolari's Brazil side 15 times, scoring on five occasions . He even returned to South America without permission over the Christmas period in 2009, angering then boss David Moyes. Jo bowed out from the Premier League as a big-money flop, quietly returning to Brazil and Internacional where he spent twelve months before joining current club Atletico Mineiro. Even back in his home country the 6' 2"" striker failed to initially shine – five goals in 36 games for Internacional didn’t exactly set the world alight and he even missed a flight for an away game after over-celebrating his birthday. But he has impressed at Mineiro upfront alongside former Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldinho and was top scorer in his first season at the club as they won the South American equivalent of the Champions League, the Copa Libertadores. Bad hair day: Gone is the long, curly hair which Jo sported in England now he is at Atletico Mineiro . Joking around: Jo (right) enjoys a laugh with ex-Manchester City team-mate Robinho .","Jo signed for Manchester City from CSKA Moscow for £18m in 2008 .

"The mother of Jamarion Lawhorn, the disturbed 12-year-old boy who knifed nine-year-old Michael Connor Verkerke to death as they played in a Michigan playground last week, offered a desperate apology to the boys parents. 'I'm so sorry', said Anita Lawhorn to the Verkerke family, reported The Detroit Free Press. 'I'm so sorry that they have to go through what they are going through. I'm just so sorry. Words.....' Scroll Down for Video . Mother: Anita Lawhorn, with her son, Jamarion (left) and two other children has apologized profusely to the parents of Michael Connor Verkerke, who died on Monday after being stabbed while he played . An allegedly suicidal Jamarion Lawhorn stabbed Verkerke four times in the back while they played on Monday, having never met his tragic victim before. 'Words cannot express what I'm going through,' said Anita Lawhorn. 'And I can't imagine having to feel that type of loss so soon, so sudden. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for them.' Amazingly, in the aftermath of what appears to be a senseless tragedy for both families, the parents of Michael Connor have let Anita Lawhorn known that they feel compassion for her suffering. 'That's so kind,' said Ania Lawhorn to The Detroit Free Press. 'I wanted to go to the vigil, but I was afraid how they would react. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.' According to the Grand Rapids Press, Anita has been beside herself since she rushed to Mercy Health Saint Mary's hospital on Monday, August 4 to be with her 12-year-old, who is charged with murder as an adult. Horrific: . Michael 'Conner' Verkerke died Monday night after being stabbed in the . back multiple times and he and friends played on a playground near his . home . Shocking: . Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, is charged with murder. He will be tried as an . adult in juvenile court. Even prosecutors said he looked small and young . for his age . Police . Jamarion didn't know Conner before the attack. They say the two boys . had been playing together when Jamarion pulled a knife out of the sand . and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back . 'She kept asking him why he did this, why he would stab a little boy, how he would feel if that had been someone else doing this to his sisters,' Kentwood police Officer Darrin Cline wrote in police reports, according to The Detroit Free Press. According to the harrowing police report of the brief time Anita spent with her son at the hospital, Jamarion showed little to no emotion as his mother scalded him. 'He had a stone-faced expression while his mother told him that he was going to be in a lot of trouble and that the boy had passed away. 'Lawhorn’s expression softened slightly when his mother was telling him that he was going to be gone for a long time facing the consequences of his actions. 'She told him that the next time he would set foot in her house would be when he is a grown man,' Cline wrote according to The Detroit Free Press. The officer mentions that he watched the medical monitor as Jamarion's mother spoke to him and saw no change in his pulse rate or blood pressure. Watch Video Here: . A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night at Pinebrook Village Mobile Home Park, the site of Monday's deadly attack . 'He did not seem at all affected. Shortly after Anita left the room I saw Lawhorn shed a single tear, but immediately he became stone-faced again and remained this way the rest of the time I was with him,' wrote Clint according to The Detroit Free Press. When asked by officers if there were any previous indicators that could have warned her about any disturbing behavior, Anita said that once, Jamarion set fire to her bed three years ago, to see what would happen. 'Anita said other than this he gets in trouble for normal kid things and she is shocked at his actions today,' the officer wrote. On Saturday it was reported that Jamarion told officers he had been planning his murder for a year. Jamarion Lawhorn also said he wanted to go to jail, did not know his young victim and that he's 'bad and always does stupid things', according to a delinquency petition filed in Kent County Circuit Court on Friday. WZZM 13 are reporting the pre-teen wanted to die and 'take somebody with him', so he swallowed some pink pills he found at home, took an eight-inch steak knife from the kitchen and walked half a mile to the Pinebrook Village playground. Lawhorn then went up behind Michael ‘Connor’ Verkerke, 9 - who was playing at the small jungle gym with his brother and a friend - and stabbed him repeatedly in the back. About 100 people gathered on Wednesday night to celebrate Connor's memory and sing Jesus Loves Me . Seriously injured, Connor was helped back to his home 100 feet away by his seven-year-old brother Kameron Verkerke. The boys' great uncle, Jim Stearns, told MLine that Connor, on the brink of death, told his brother: 'If anything happens to me, it’s not your fault. I’ll always love you.' Connor later died in hospital. Lawhorn left the playground and called police to turn himself in. He initially said he wasn't concerned for the victim, then said he was concerned because ""it made him feel stupid,"" an investigator wrote. He is designated as an adult in the juvenile court system, which would allow the boy, if convicted, to be sentenced as a juvenile and then as an adult once he turns 21. Lawhorn's attorney, Charles Boekeloo, entered a not-guilty plea for his client on Tuesday. A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night at Pinebrook Village Mobile Home Park, the site of Monday’s deadly attack. About 100 people gathered to celebrate Connor's memory. Stearns said the incident has 'terrorized' the park for kids - in particular, two of Connor’s brothers who were with him when the attack occurred. 'They’re afraid,' he said. The Verkerke family were also concerned about the Jamarion Lawhorn's family. 'Even though we’re dealing with a different type of pain, they’ll be dealing with a similar pain every day for the rest of their lives. That’s not to be taken lightly,' said Stearns. Horrific: . A 9-year-old boy died at the hospital after being attacked on the . playground by a 12-year-old, police say. He was stabbed at least once in . the back with a kitchen knife . The community has some together to help Conner's mom pay for his funeral. A Go Fund Me page set up yesterday has already raised more than $13,000 from 321 people. The Grand Rapids Press reports that Jamarion sobbed and trembled as he appeared in court on Tuesday to face murder charges. Even the prosecutor, who has opted to try him in juvenile court as an adult, remarked that he looked 'tiny' and younger than his age. His mother appeared in court with him and wiped away his tears and rubbed his back to comfort him. Children and adults both laughed and cried during the vigil, reports MLive before Stearns, who is the uncle of Connor's mom, spoke to the crowd and everyone joined in to sing Jesus Loves Me. ‘Their top priority right now is the mental health of their three remaining children,’ Stearns said of the devastated Verkerke family. Community members honored Connor's memory with teddy bears, passed out by vigil organizers, placed next to a cross on the side of the playground. Jamarion's lawyer asked that the boy undergo a psychological examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial. The 12-year-old did, however, tell a judge that he understood the charges against him. Under Michigan law, Jamarion could be given a 'blended' sentence if he is convicted, which would keep him in a juvenile detention facility until he is 21. After that, a judge would determine whether he should be released or sent to adult prison. Random: . Police say the 12-year-old didn't know the young boy he attacked and he . didn't live in the trailer park near the playground . Police say that Jamarion's attack on Conner was unprovoked and inexplicable. He didn't know Conner before the attack and had joined the 9-year-old and two friends on the playground. Suddenly, he pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back, authorities say. Police aren't saying where Jamarion got the weapon. Conner ran to his home house nearby and collapsed on the porch. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition an died hours later. Authorities say Jamarion is the youngest child ever charged with murder in Kent County - and one of the youngest in the state of Michigan. An 11-year-old boy was convicted of killing his mother's boyfriend in 1997 in Pontiac, Michigan. Witness: Glen Stacy says the 12-year-old suspect asked to borrow his cell phone then called 911 and admitted he had killed . Witness Glen Stacy told the Press he was doing yard work when Jamarion approached him and asked to borrow his cell phone. Mr Stacy said he assumed the child was calling him mother. Instead the 12-year-old called cops and admitted to a brutal crime. Mr Stacy says the boy told police: 'I want to die. I don’t want to be on this earth anymore. Please pick me up.' He says Jamarion told him that he lashed out because he had 'taken many pills' and nobody loved him. The 12-year-old was eerily calm and patiently waited for police, Mr Stacy told the Press.

"A federal jury returned guilty verdicts for all four former Blackwater security guards charged in the 2007 shootings of more than 30 Iraqis in Baghdad. The jury in Washington found Nicholas Slatten guilty of first-degree murder, and the three other  guards — Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard — guilty of at least three counts of voluntary manslaughter. The four men were charged with a combined 33 counts in the shootings, but the jury had reached verdicts on only part of the charges after weeks of deliberations. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth allowed the jury to announce the verdicts agreed upon, with the expectation jurors would continue deliberating on the other counts. Scroll down for video .

Scandal: Paul Slough, right and Nick Slatten were found guilty  in  the shootings that caused an international uproar (seen in December 2008) Lengthy: Former Blackwater Worldwide security guard Dustin Heard leaves federal court in Washington in this January 2009 file photo. The case was mired in legal battles for years, making it uncertain whether the defendants would ever be tried . Attorney: Bill Coffield, a lawyer for Blackwater security guard Evan Liberty, speaks to media as he leaves Federal Court on Wednesday . The shootings on Sept. 16, 2007, caused an international uproar over the role of defense contractors in urban warfare. The State Department hired Blackwater to protect American diplomats in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, and elsewhere in the country. Blackwater convoys of four heavily armored vehicles operated in risky environments where car bombs and attacks by insurgents were common. Slatter was charged with first-degree murder; the others were charged with voluntary manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and gun charges. The case was mired in legal battles for years, making it uncertain whether the defendants would ever be tried. The trial focused on the killings of 14 Iraqis and the wounding of 17 others. During an 11-week trial, prosecutors summoned 72 witnesses, including Iraqi victims, their families and former colleagues of the defendant Blackwater guards. There was sharp disagreement over the facts in the case. The defendants' lawyers said there was strong evidence the guards were targeted with gunfire from insurgents and Iraqi police, leading the guards to shoot back in self-defense. Federal prosecutors said there was no incoming gunfire and that the shootings by the guards were unprovoked. The prosecution focused on the defendants' intent, contending that some of the Blackwater guards harbored a low regard and deep hostility toward Iraqi civilians. Michael J. Baratz, one of the attorneys for former Blackwater security guard Paul Slough, walks from Federal Court . Attorneys for former Blackwater guard Nicholas Slatten walk away from the courthouse. Slatten was found guilty of first-degree murder . Lawyer: Thomas Connolly, attorney for former Blackwater security guard Nicholas Slatten, leaves Federal Court on Wednesday . Deadly: The trial focused on the 2007 Baghdad killings of 14 Iraqis and the wounding of 17 others . Soldier: Evan Liberty (pictured in June 2014) was also found guilty  of at least three counts of voluntary manslaughter . The guards, the prosecution said, held 'a grave indifference' to the death and injury that their actions probably would cause Iraqis. Several former Blackwater guards testified that they had been generally distrustful of Iraqis, based on experience the guards said they had had in being led into ambushes. Prosecutors said that from a vantage point inside his convoy's command vehicle, Slatten aimed his SR-25 sniper rifle through a gun portal, killing the driver of a stopped white Kia sedan, Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia'y. At the trial, two Iraqi traffic officers and one of the shooting victims testified the car was stopped at the time the shots were fired. The assertion that the car was stopped supported the prosecution argument that the shots were unwarranted. Defense lawyers pressed their argument that other Blackwater guards — not Slatten — fired the first shots at the Kia sedan and that they did so only after the vehicle moved slowly toward the convoy, posing what appeared to be a threat to the Blackwater guards' safety. Once the shooting started, hundreds of Iraqi citizens ran for their lives. It was 'gunfire coming from the left, gunfire coming from the right,' prosecutor Anthony Asuncion told the jury in closing arguments. One of the government witnesses in the case, Blackwater guard Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty to killing the driver's mother, who died in the passenger seat of the white Kia next to her son. The maximum sentence for conviction of first-degree murder is life imprisonment. The gun charges carry mandatory minimum prison terms of 30 years. The maximum prison term for involuntary manslaughter is eight years; for attempted manslaughter it is seven years.","A federal jury found Blackwater guard Nicholas Slatten guilty of first-degree murder .

"A bizarre 80-year-old ban on playing pinball machines in Oakland, California, has finally been lifted and a month-long tournament is being run to celebrate. The game was outlawed across the U.S in the 1930s because it was considered gambling. Officials argued that this classification was warranted as there was very little skill involved – that it was a game of chance. Pinball machines were outlawed across the U.S in the 1930s because it was considered gambling - but this ban has been flipped in Oakland . They may have had a point as early machines didn't have flippers to control the ball. Lawmakers were also suspicions that the Mafia was controlling revenue from the machines and that they were distracting teenagers from more productive activities. At first the law was strictly enforced with police in New York in the 1940s told that confiscating machines and arresting the owners was a top priority. Competition: To celebrate the pinball ban being overturned RadioShack is running a tournament using an Iron Man machine . Game on: (From left) Travis Hendricks, RadioShack Director of Marketing, Brett White,  Director of Internal Communications, Aaron Nelson from the International Flipper Pinball Association and Chris Kooluris, RadioShack's Pinball Consultant  test the  Ironman Vault Edition pinball machine . The tide was turned in the pro-pinball lobby's favour in 1976 when members of the amusement industry proved to the City Council that it was in fact a game of skill by getting a top player to demonstrate his expert touch. The council overturned the ban and other cities followed suit, but Oakland held fast, until last month. To celebrate the momentous occasion pinball retailer RadioShack and maker Stern Pinball - the only manufacturer in the U.S - are running a month-long tournament. Competitors are battling it out on an Iron Man Pro Vault Edition machine installed at RadioShack's Fruitvale Store in Oakland. Whoever notches up the highest score wins the machine. Mike DeFazio, senior vice president of store concepts at RadioShack, said: 'Friends in the Maker community and other loyal customers inspired us to celebrate the return of pinball in Oakland. The pinball resurgence is a perfect combination of the best of retro and future technology. 'We thought this tournament would be a fun way to help celebrate our opening of 21 interactive remodel stores in the San Francisco and Oakland area. The game is legendary and has appeal for experts and novices alike.' 'Along with our friends at RadioShack, we're obviously psyched to see pinball prohibition end in Oakland,' said Gary Stern, CEO, Stern Pinball. 'Our company has origins in the pinball industry that date back to the ban's enactment itself. We're both honored and amazed to see brands like RadioShack embrace pinball, and help make it more accessible to a new generation of fans.'","Pinball machines were outlawed across America in the 1930s and 40s .

"The Marquess of Northampton married Tracy Goodman last year (pictured) after five failed marriages . When the Marquess of Northampton, one of Britain’s wealthiest aristocrats, divorced his fifth wife, his friends worried that he would never be truly happy again. And they were understandably concerned to learn that, despite the deep acrimony of the split and a vast £17 million settlement, the 68-year-old Marquess was now contemplating going down the aisle for an astonishing sixth time – to marry a glamorous blonde psychotherapist and yoga teacher who is 18 years his junior. Now, one year on from their wedding at Chelsea Register Office, Tracy Goodman has decided to speak about her dramatic change of fortune, which has taken her from life as a state-school educated career woman with a flat just off London’s Chiswick High Road to a new world as a Marchioness and chatelaine of not one but two stately homes, including the magnificent 84-room Compton Wynyates, a Tudor mansion in Warwickshire. And, while she won’t discuss the details of any professional help she may have given her new husband, who is known as Spenny, it is clear, say his friends, that he is happier than he has been for years. ‘When I look through my bedroom window and I’m in a castle and see the gorgeous view, moat and 17th Century windmill, I have to pinch myself. It feels like a dream,’ says Tracy. ‘But meeting and marrying Spenny was completely natural. Finding love like that was all about timing – it came right for both of us. ‘I still see all my old friends and they assure me I haven’t let my marriage into the aristocracy go to my head. I haven’t changed and I don’t intend to.’ The collapse of the Marquess’s fifth marriage to Pamela, his wife of 23 years, had been all the more distressing because it emerged that she had been conducting an affair with one of his closest friends, pharmaceutical tycoon Dr Dan Stoicescu. Like his new wife, Pamela Haworth had come from humble origins, the daughter of a toolmaker from Accrington, Lancashire. The Marquess had often described her as the love of his life but last year he divorced her on grounds of adultery. Scroll down for video . The couple live in the 84-room Tudor mansion Compton Wynates in Warwickshire . Yet romance returned to his life just months later, when the daughter from his fourth marriage, Lady Louisa, introduced him to Tracy on a visit to California. The Marchioness, who speaks with a soft Devon burr, is originally from Plymouth, where a youthful passion for surfing and international travel led her into a career as an air stewardess with British Airways. While at BA, she took degrees in psychotherapy and trained as a yoga teacher, rising to become manager and clinical supervisor of the airline’s in-house counselling service Crewcare. She later went on to work at the celebrity rehab clinic The Priory, where she specialised in eating disorders and sex addiction. She also studied at the famous Meadows clinic in Arizona – whose clients have included celebrities such as Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, Kate Moss and Ronnie Wood – and now works at The Recovery Centre in Belgravia. ‘I specialise in relationship difficulties, depression and anxiety. I like to be able to help others – but most people seem to like referring to me being a sex therapist!’ she smiles. ‘It does feel weird to have such a grand title but I don’t go around wearing a tiara,’ she laughs, speaking at a cocktail party she hosted in aid of International Animal Rescue charity at a London private members’ club. ‘Being a Marchioness is still very new – we recently celebrated our first wedding anniversary. It’s something to adjust to. Spenny has such presence, especially with the locals in the countryside in Warwickshire. I’m adapting to the role.’ Spenny, whose real name is Spencer Compton, is sometimes known as the ‘Mystic Marquess’ because of his fascination with Freemasonry and ancient mysticism. Wives numbers one and two: The Marquess was married to Henriette Bentinck, the daughter of the late Dutch ambassador Baron Adolph Bentinck from 1967-1973 (left). The year after his first divorce, he wed Annette Smallwood (right) In 1977, Rosie Dawson-Damer became his third wife but the pair divorced in 1983. She is reported to have received a settlement and a trust fund for their daughter in the proceedings . The new couple now divide their time between Grade I listed Compton Wynyates and their other stately pile, Castle Ashby in Northamptonshire, which is currently home to his 41-year-old son and heir Daniel, Earl Compton, and his villa on the island of Tenerife. They also spend a good deal of time in America. Tracy will shortly celebrate her 50th birthday on a trip to Arizona with her husband, who has a fortune estimated at £120 million. ‘When we were first married, all that people seemed to concentrate on was his marriage scandal and saying I was a sex therapist, but there’s a lot more to my practice than that,’ she says. ‘Although I’ve scaled down my psychotherapy work because I need to travel with Spenny, I’m determined to continue in practice because I value my independence,’ she explains. She does admit, however, that she doesn’t use her grand title in her professional life. ‘I don’t particularly want everybody to know who I married because I was concerned it might affect my relationship with them,’ she explains. She has also become stepmother to the Marquess’s four children (by wives one, three and four) and five grandchildren and latest in a succession of Marchionesses. Lord Northampton’s first marriage in 1967 was to Henriette Bentinck, daughter of the late Dutch ambassador Baron Adolph Bentinck. The couple had two children but divorced in 1973. It is said that Henriette received a six-figure settlement, but that she was so financially unaware, she lodged it in her current account. Fritzi (Ellen) Erhardt, the ex-wife of Viscount Cowdray (left) became the Marques's fourth wife in 1985. The pair were married for three years before he met Pamela Haworth (right) who he was to be married to the longest . She died in 2010. In 1974, Spenny married Annette Smallwood, the secretary of KIDS, a charity for deprived children, which he had set up. They divorced three years later in 1977. The woman who was to become his third wife – Rosie Dawson-Damer – was named in the divorce petition, and he married her the same year. In 1983, however, Lord Northampton was back in the divorce courts. ‘He gave me a settlement and a trust fund for our daughter,’ Rosie revealed at the time. Then came Fritzi (Ellen) Erhardt, the ex-wife of Viscount Cowdray, whom he married in 1985. The couple had split once even before they wed and finally divorced in 1988. Lawyers said she could have claimed millions but it was reported at the time that she had accepted a settlement of about £300,000. It was, however, the Marquess’s acrimonious fifth marriage – and divorce – that attracted the greatest scandal. ‘She is the centre of my life. I call her “stregissima” – great white witch,’ he said delightedly when he married Pamela Haworth in December 1990 at a Stratford-Upon-Avon register office. He was Pamela’s third husband. The couple's lengthy marriage ended after the Marquess discovered her affair with a family friend . The marriage was by some distance his most successful. But in 2006, they met Romanian-born Dr Stoicescu at a Freemasonry convention in Cyprus. Dr Stoicescu calls himself a ‘transhumanist’ and has a deep-seated interest in immortality and anti-ageing therapies. He has his own fortune estimated at £180 million. The divorced scientist and entrepreneur became a firm family friend, paying for both the Marquess and Pamela to undergo a £220,000 human genome mapping process – which can reveal genetic diseases – at a US clinic. Stoicescu also lavished gifts on Pamela, including a Cartier necklace with matching earrings. And by 2009 she had begun working for him, telling her husband that she had been made president of one of his biopharmaceutical companies, a role that meant she made frequent trips to America. Though the Marquess had become suspicious of how close Stoicescu was becoming to his wife, it was not until he was handed tapes of conversations between Pamela and her 87-year-old father, which confirmed the affair – and became the subject of a potentially costly legal wrangle – that he had evidence which led him to file divorce proceedings in 2010. The tapes had been made by Suzanne Shipwright, a 62-year-old former beautician who has lived with Pamela’s father Jim for the past few decades, since his divorce from her mother Martina. Suzanne is said to have had a troubled relationship with Pamela. It prompted the Marquess to throw her out of Compton Wynyates and sparked a bitter court battle which lasted more than two years. Pamela’s divorce settlement is believed to have cost him in the region of £17 million. This includes a £4 million apartment in Pimlico as well as cash and possessions worth about £13 million. Despite his five divorces, Lord Northampton still has a sizeable £120 million fortune – including the stately homes and a hoard of Roman treasure worth £100 million, but so contentious it cannot be sold. Pamela has had further difficulties since then. Last June she was served with an eviction notice by Dr Stoicescu demanding she leave his spectacular £8 million mansion in San Diego, California, where she had been living since her divorce. He, meanwhile, had engaged on an affair of his own – later marrying his new mistress, 50-year-old Maria Torres from the Dominican Republic. Tracy, however, is undeterred by all the fuss. ‘It took me a long time to find the right man – I had a few long- term boyfriends before, but no children,’ she explains. She may be a Marchioness, but she remains as practical and down-to-earth as ever. ‘I’m still the same old me – Tracy, without an E,’ she says. Lady Northampton was interviewed at the Rescue Me fundraiser for International Animal Rescue which is particularly campaigning to save orang-utans in Borneo and to stop illegal birdhunting in Malta.

"A record number of Australians are entering into debt agreements after spending beyond their means, jeopardising their job prospects and future financial security. Statistics from the Australian Financial Security Authority show that the number of Australians in debt agreements in the September quarter was 3010 - the highest number on record in a quarter and up 22.4 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Just 7.7 percent of debt agreements signed were business related, suggesting the majority were entered into due to reckless spending. Scroll down for video . The number of Australians in debt agreements in the September quarter was the highest number on record in a quarter . Debt expert Roger Mendelson said young people were the main applicants for debt agreements. 'In our experience invariably this is customers and fairly young people who aren't homeowners,' said Mr Mendelson, CEO of Prushka Fast Debt Recovery. 'Their main debts tend to be credit card and telcos - so these are young people who have got one credit card and when that's maxed out opened another. 'They play they game but in the end they're bound to fail.' Under a debt agreement a consumer and their creditors settle on an amount of money to be repayed, which can be less than the total amount owed. Once the person has repayed this creditors cannot recover the rest of the money owed. Consumers who enter into a debt agreement cannot earn more than $79,920 and their assets can't total more than $106,561. But proposing a debt agreement is considered an act of bankruptcy and puts a black mark on people's public record. Names and details are permanently listed on the National Personal Insolvency Index, and also appear on credit reporting agency's records, which can affect people's ability to apply for credit. Young people with credit card and telco debt are the main applicants for debt agreements . Debt agreements can also prevent people from working in certain industries. 'It is under the Bankruptcy Act and it's going to hang over you for the rest of your life,' Mr Mendelson said. He added that and if the agreed payments under the debt agreement are not met, creditors can petition for bankruptcy, meaning a person's assets are vulnerable and their passports can be cancelled. Consumer Action Law Centre senior campaigner Sarah Wilson said people should be aware of fees associated with debt agreements. 'People think it's different to bankruptcy but in fact it's an act of bankruptcy,' Ms Wilson said. 'The most important thing is people need to realise that debt agreements are a product sold, they're not necessarily going to be the best option for people in financial stress. 'People can contact a free financial counsellor on 1800 007 007, they're independent and they're not going to charge you anything.'","The number of Australians in debt agreements up 22.4 percent .

A second commented: 'I went right back to the 60s and had to choose Mary Quant as the winner of the most iconic bob. I'm not necessarily saying I liked it that much because it did look a bit like a bowl cut, but it is definitely the most classic.'

"Lobbyist Terry Thames fell ill near the Pentagon and was taken to hospital - where experts said she does not have Ebola . Chaos erupted outside the Pentagon today after a woman vomiting in a parking lot sparked an Ebola scare. Terry Thames, a Washington lobbyist, got off a bus and fell ill in the parking lot, prompting a shutdown of the affected area. But despite the swift and severe response, she was soon found not to have the disease. First responders say she told them she had recently been to West Africa - the epicenter of the Ebola crisis - prompting fears she had brought the deadly virus back with her. But her employers swiftly denied she had been anywhere near the affected countries. She was rushed to hospital where she was interviewed about her travel history and given the all-clear . Pentagon police locked down a building entrance and a portion of a parking lot. Seven staff involved in the response were also isolated in what the Pentagon called 'an abundance of caution'. Defense officials said they could be kept in a tent at the Pentagon overnight as a precaution. Several people who were on the shuttle bus also have been isolated. All pedestrian and vehicle traffic was stopped across 17 lanes of the huge parking lot, shortly before 10am on Friday. Scroll down for video . The Ebola scare was caused by a woman, identified by her company today as Terry Thames, who vomited in the parking lot and allegedly said she had recently been to West Africa . A building entrance and parking lanes were temporarily closed as part of the Pentagon police's infectious disease protocols. Ms Thames works for Total Spectrum - a lobbying and public relations firm. Managing Director Steve Gordon said in a statement that the Pentagon had contacted him and he said she had not been out of the Washington area. The lobbyist was on a Metro bus and was not believed to have been traveling to the Pentagon, which is also near a central transport hub. A Pentagon police officer directs a woman away from a closed-off Pentagon parking lot in the wake of the scare . However she transferred to a shuttle bus taking guests to a change of responsibility ceremony for General Joe Dunford, who is taking over as commandant of the Marine Corps. The Pentagon official said it did not immediately appear that she was invited to the ceremony. She got off the shuttle before it left the Pentagon parking lot and then vomited, prompting the Ebola scare. Thames was taken to hospital, where experts said they were 'confident' that Ebola is not a possibility. A statement from the public health departments of Arlington and Fairfax counties said: 'Based on the public health investigation, which included the travel history of a woman who became ill this morning in a Pentagon parking lot, and on questioning of her by medical staff, medical authorities are confident that she does not have Ebola.' 'Arlington County Fire Department Emergency Medical Services transported the woman to Fairfax Inova Hospital Friday morning, after she became ill in a Pentagon parking lot.' 'The woman had displayed symptoms consistent with the virus and her travel history was uncertain. 'She was put in isolation at Fairfax Inova Hospital. Arlington County took all necessary precautions to protect public health during this event, including activating its Emergency Operations Center. We are beginning to break down those operations now.' It is not clear what - if any - medical tests were carried out. It is also not clear what her true travel history is. The Pentagon insists that they were told she had been to Africa. Lt Col Crosson, a spokesman, said: 'During the response, the individual indicated that she had recently visited Africa. 'Out of an abundance of caution, all pedestrian and vehicular traffic was suspended around the South Parking lot, while Arlington County responded to the scene. 'At 0953, the individual was taken to the Virginia Hospital Center. 'Out of an abundance of caution and to allow the investigation to proceed, pedestrian and vehicular traffic around the Pentagon South Parking lot's lanes 7-23 will remain restricted until further notice. The Corridor 2 entrance to the Pentagon is also closed.' Officials notified the FBI and were checking the woman's background and possible travel to West Africa. A Pentagon Police officer secures the perimeter to the Pentagon South Parking lot area today after it was closed today out of an abundance of caution when Ms Thames, who claimed to have traveled to West Africa, vomited in the open air . What caused the woman to become sick is unclear. Ebola is only transmitted through direct contact with a victim's bodily fluids. She was being evaluated by hospital staff and the Fairfax County Health Department but it had not yet been decided whether to test her for the Ebola virus . There has been only one case of a person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States after travel to West Africa - Thomas Eric Duncan, who died in Dallas earlier this month. Hundreds of suspicious cases have turned out to be false alarms.

Her car was found in the Edmond, Oklahoma, more a week later when a resident recognized it from a flier that had been handed out in the area. A week after she vanished, her mother Lori Hill told KFOR NewsChannel 4: 'Vivacious, outgoing, never met a stranger,' said Lori Hill in April. 'That's not a kid that's planning on running away. That's not a kid that doesn't want to be with her family. That's my Annie Jo.' While she was missing, her mother also left a voice mail message on her phone which said: 'Anne, I hope that’s you, I love you and miss you. 'I’ll come get you wherever you are, just leave me a message or call your brothers, we all want you home. Anne, I hope it’s you.' A search warrant was reportedly issued at an Oklahoma City apartment complex in connection with Hill's disappearance.

"AC Milan have sacked Clarence Seedorf and appointed Filippo Inzaghi as the club's new manager. Dutchman Seedorf only arrived at the San Siro in January - succeeding Massimiliano Allegri after the club's disappointing start to the season - but has been relieved of his duties after Milan finished eighth in Serie A. Inzaghi, a San Siro legend like Seedorf, has never coached at a senior level but has been promoted from Milan's Under 19 team. Relieved of his duties: Clarence Seedorf has been sacked as manager of AC Milan . Pointing the way: AC Milan legend Filippo Inzaghi has been appointed as the new manager at the San Siro . Struggles: Milan, playing with Mario Balotelli up front, finished eighth in Serie A last season . A statement released by the club read: 'AC Milan wishes to communicate that Coach Clarence Seedorf has been sacked, and the first team has been entrusted to Pippo Inzaghi until June 30, 2016.' According to Gazzetta dello Sport the Milan board were initially unwilling to pay the remainder of Seedorf's wages he was owed after signing a two-and-a-half-year deal. However, the club will now put the former Holland midfielder on gardening leave and continue to pay him until the end of his contract. The sacking comes after Milan president Silvio Berlusconi said that the former Rossoneri star was part of the club's 'past' on Friday, though he did stop short of confirming that the Dutchman had been sacked. Seedorf scored a hat-trick for Jose Mourinho's Rest of the World team during Sunday's Soccer Aid charity match and also hit a stunning volley during last week's clash between Real Madrid and Juventus legends.

"When my mother was diagnosed with terminal of breast cancer, she was devastated but also surprised because, as she put it, 'we weren't a cancer family'. There was no strong history of the disease whatsoever. Her mother had died of lung failure after years of smoking and other relatives had succumbed to heart disease. An American cousin had died of breast cancer, but that felt, both genetically and geographically, far removed. But eight years later, at the end of . 2010, I was told that I was a carrier of the BRCA1 mutation - an genetic . abnormality which makes me far more likely than non-carriers to get . breast cancer. It also makes me highly susceptible . to ovarian cancer. Gaby is pictured with her son Ari and daughter Racheli. She says that having children made the decision to undergoing a double mastectomy easier to make . The lifetime chance of a woman developing breast cancer is 10 per cent, but this goes up to 80 per cent  if they possess a mutated BRCA gene. The gene also raises the risk of developing ovarian cancer from 1.4 per cent to up to 40 per cent. My brother had been urging me for several months to take the BRCA test. But I didn't think it was necessary - given our cancer-free family history, it had never occurred to me that my mother’s cancer was a result of a genetic fault. Eventually I decided to go ahead - but more to shut him up than because I was concerned about being a carrier. I was living in Tokyo at the time with my husband and son Ari, now 6, and Racheli, 5. I had an excellent GP who managed to find a Japanese geneticist who could arrange the tests. At my first visit, he told me that I would have to undergo several genetic counselling sessions to help me decide whether or not to have the test. But I told him that I was already decided. I would do the test at my next visit. I reassured him that if I were found to have the mutation, I would have a mastectomy and an oophorectomy. Gaby, pictured with her two children, said that she didn't think she needed the BRCA test because there was no history of the cancer in the family. She had believed her mother's cancer was simply a case of bad luck. Gaby wanted another baby before she underwent preventative surgery but her husband Gary (pictured) said that this wasn't a good reason to have another child . I have since realised how very easy it is to say things when you don’t ever imagine you will have to act on them. The test was simple. A small phial of blood was taken and shipped off to a laboratory in the U.S. When I went to collect my results several weeks later, I saw them before I heard them. The report was on a table between the doctor and myself. Various markers had been analysed and I could see that next to BRCA1 it said 'deleterious'. I hadn’t even heard of that word before that afternoon, let alone understood its meaning. Now I know only too well. Gaby plans to undergo a double mastectomy next month and possibly have her ovaries removed when she reaches 40 . It means lying in bed at night, checking for breast lumps and living with the anxiety that the next lump you discover is going to be cancer. It means going for yearly mammograms and bi-annual MRIs and ultrasounds and waiting nervously for the results. The alternative is to undergo prophylactic surgery – the removal of both breasts and the ovaries to greatly reduce my chances of getting cancer. Nearly everyone I told about my mutation seemed to think it was a no-brainer. 'I would have it done tomorrow,' was the stock response. I know that the people who said this had my best interests at heart, but would they really feel like that if they were in my position? Admittedly, neither breasts nor ovaries are vital organs – I could easily survive without them. They don’t help you walk, write or speak. Yet, they are an intrinsic part of my identity - my sexuality and my sense of femininity. When discussing the possibility of an oophorectomy at the age of 40 with my gynaecologist, I joked to him that it would 'complete the sex-change', while silently weeping inside. My breasts and my ovaries have defined turning points in my life – the transitions from girlhood to adolescence, to womanhood and latterly to motherhood. There is a cruel irony that something that creates and nurtures life so beautifully, can turn out to be the greatest threat to your own survival. When I first heard the news I was a BRCA1 carrier, I told my husband that we needed to have another baby – and fast. I had a strong desire to use these procreating parts of me one last time before they were swiped away on the operating table. He reasoned with me, saying that my mutation was not a reason to have another child. More importantly, I do need to stick around for the two beautiful children I already have. So rather than spend the rest of my life anxiously waiting for cancer, which may or may not happen, I intend to reduce my chances drastically. In the coming month, I plan to undergo a double mastectomy – with sizable reconstruction as my happy returns. I’ll have my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed at 40. While my mum was right about many things, sadly her take on the family’s genetic makeup was incorrect. We are a cancer family and will continue to be until someone discovers a cure. In the meantime, I need to get on with trying to prevent it.","Gaby Wine had no family history of cancer until her mother died of disease .

"The moment Elvis Presley arrived at the White House to ask President Richard Nixon to make him an undercover federal agent will be dramatized in a movie. Kevin Spacey will play Nixon and Michael Shannon will take the role of Presley in the bizarre tale about the bedraggled singer's offer to help save the US from hippies and The Beatles. With filming slated to start in 2015, Elvis & Nixon, produced by The Butler's Cassian Elwes, is expected to probe one of the more curious elements of pop history. It started on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Washington on December 21, 1970. Movie material: Elvis Presley's letter led to one of the most bizarre encounters ever to take place in the White House, an unlikely meeting of counter-culture icon and Right-wing bogeyman. It will now be made into a film . Getting into character: Kevin Spacey (left) will take the role of Nixon and Michael Shannon (right) is Elvis . Elvis was riled. He had spent around $100,000 on 10 Mercedez Benz cars and 32 handguns for Christmas presents but his family said it was too much. The 35-year-old rock 'n' roll star, pumped with prescription pills, stormed straight to the airport - and found himself sat next to a California senator, George Murphy. He vented that he was desperate to get his hands on a Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs ID badge to help the president's war on drugs. Astounded, Murphy urged him to put pen to paper and let Nixon know of his burning desire. So he did. Plea: Presley scribbled this note aboard an airplane on December 21, 1970, in which he blasted The Beatles and hippies as anti-American . Presley immediately requested a wad of headed paper from a stewardess and scrawled five nearly illegible pages of erratic suggestions to the president. He explained America regarded him as an ally, but in fact he loved 'the establishment'. He said he was willing to do anything to serve his country - as long as he were made a Federal Agent at Large. 'I have done an in-depth study of drug abuse and Communist brainwashing techniques and I am right in the middle of the whole thing, where I can and will do the most good,' he wrote. The plane landed and Presley took his urgent request straight to the front door of the White House. 'I would love to meet you,' he wrote to Nixon, adding that he would be staying at the Washington Hotel under the alias Jon Burrows. 'I will be here for as long as it takes to get the credentials of a federal agent.' Incredibly, the president's aides implored Nixon to take up the offer in a bid to win his war on drugs and capture the public following the deaths of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. By noon that day, he was in the Oval Office. They discussed many things, once Elvis overcame his apparent awe. He told Nixon that The Beatles were anti-American for taking US money and flocking back to the UK. Just minutes in, Nixon agreed to make Presley an Honorary Agent at Large - earning a hug from the King. Starstruck: Sources claim the King of Rock 'n' Roll took a while to overcome his awe in the Oval Office . Agreement: Minutes in, Nixon conceded and made Elvis an Honorary Federal Agent at Large, handing him ID . The story remained secret for a year until The Washington Post got wind of it. The singer died in 1977 of a possible overdose on his bathroom floor. Friends and biographers later questioned his genuine admiration for the president's right-wing policies, claiming the ID badge was something he'd been hankering after for years. However, many have given Elvis the title of 'closet Republican' in the years since.","Kevin Spacey to play Nixon and Michael Shannon will be Elvis .

"As the selection continues for a second jury to re-examine Jodie Arias's sentence, an auction has taken place to raise money for a Phoenix charity by auctioning off her infamous glasses.

Arias' attempts to make money off her notoriety are not new; she's been selling art on her website. The Maricopa County Sheriffs Office said while they doubt these glasses are even hers they couldn't stop her from selling them because they weren't associated with the actual crime. Trial: During her trial for the 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend, jurors could not decide on her ultimate sentence . Guilty: Jodi Arias was found guilty of the murder of Travis Alexander in 2008 after stabbing and shooting him .

The 34-year-old former waitress was convicted of murder last year in the 2008 killing of her ex-boyfriend, but jurors couldn't reach a decision on her sentence. Under Arizona law, prosecutors have the option of putting on a second penalty phase with a new jury in an effort to secure a death sentence. If the new jury fails to reach a unanimous decision, the death penalty will be removed as an option. The judge would then sentence Arias to spend her entire life behind bars or be eligible for release after 25 years. Arias admitted killing Travis Alexander at his suburban Phoenix home, but she said it was self-defense. He was stabbed nearly 30 times, had his throat slit and was shot in the head. Prosecutors argued the killing was premeditated and carried out in a jealous rage when Alexander wanted to end their affair.

"Child killer Subhan Anwar was murdered in his cell . A prison has been criticised for taking 50 minutes to call in medics after two inmates strangled a child killer with a pair of jogging bottoms in his cell. An official report into the murder of Subhan Anwar at Worcestershire's Long Lartin Prison found the authorities took 50 minutes to call in paramedics who then took a further 30 minutes to reach the prison's rural location. The report also revealed the two killers, Gary Smith, 49, and Lee Newell, 45, had both taken hostages during earlier, but separate, prison sieges in 2007 and 2011. Smith and Newell, who were already serving life sentences for murders committed in the 1980s and 1990s, blamed each other for the death of Anwar. The pair had only moved on to the vulnerable prisoner wing because they owed prison drug debts. The convicted murderers tied up and strangled Anwar with a pair of jogging bottoms in his cell in a vulnerable prisoner wing on Valentine's Day last year. After Anwar was strangled, Smith calmly made Newell a cup of hot chocolate - even sweetening it with icing sugar - during a stand-off with prison staff. Gary Smith (left) and Lee Newell (right) tied up and strangled Subhan Anwar with a pair of jogging bottoms - after Anwar was strangled, Smith calmly made Newell a cup of hot chocolate . Prison staff were initially told Anwar had been taken hostage because the two inmates were 'bored' - with Newell telling a warder: 'He's gone, he's with Allah.' Both defendants opted not to give evidence at the trial, but CCTV and DNA evidence proved they were involved in the killing. A post mortem examination found Anwar's neck had been broken. They were found guilty of murdering the 24-year-old  last September following a two-week trial at Warwick Crown Court. Newell also confessed to stealing a watch, prayer beads and a metal earring belonging to Anwar, while Smith admitted the theft of property from the child-killer's cell. In the report from the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, it said Newell had 47 prison disciplinary adjudications against him while Smith had 32 proven disciplinary adjudications between 1999 and 2011. The report added: 'Both men had previously been involved in hostage-taking, but there had been no recent evidence to indicate that either of them posed any significant risk of violence to other prisoners.' It criticised the time it took for an ambulance to be called, and said: 'While it would not have altered the outcome for the man, we consider that an ambulance should have been called as soon as it became apparent that there was the possibility of serious injury which would require immediate medical attention. 'A delay in calling an ambulance could have serious consequences in future hostage incidents where a prisoner is still alive. We therefore make the following recommendation: the Governor of Long Lartin should ensure that in the event of a hostage incident, staff call an ambulance immediately if there is any indication that a prisoner has been, or could be, injured.' Sanam Navsarka suffered 107 injuries during a month of 'unbelievable' cruelty before she died . Anwar, a salesman from Huddersfield, was serving a life sentence for killing his partner's two-year-old daughter, Sanam Navsarka. The youngster suffered 107 injuries during a month of 'unbelievable' cruelty in which she was battered with metal poles and had all four limbs broken. The child, who was afraid of the dark, was 'disciplined' by being repeatedly locked in an unlit cupboard, while Anwar also put her in a tumble drier and dumped her in a bin for his amusement. Sanam suffered further agony when aftershave was splashed on her nappy rash and open sores. She was not taken to a doctor, so her fractures remained untreated. In her final days she was suffering so much from her injuries that she could not walk and died when fat deposits from her broken bones entered the bloodstream. An official report in to the murder of Anwar at Worcestershire's Long Lartin Prison found the authorities took 50 minutes to call in paramedics who then took a further 30 minutes to reach the prison's rural location . A post-mortem examination revealed that along with her broken arms and legs, there were 36 bruises to her head and neck, 26 to her arms and ten to her abdomen. Her mother Zahbeena Navsarka, then 21, was sentenced to nine years in jail after she was cleared of her daughter's murder but found guilty of manslaughter. A prison service spokesman said: 'We will look closely at the findings of the inquest and any report the coroner may make to see what lessons can be learned.' A response from the prison to the report read: 'The relevant contingency plans have now been updated to specifically state that an ambulance is called immediately.'","Child killer Subhan Anwar, 24, strangled to death with jogging bottoms .
