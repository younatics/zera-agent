Curiosity has taken its first sniff of Martian air as engineers begin testing all of its scientific instruments. The robot sucked the air into its big Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument, which is designed to reveal the concentration of different gases on the red planet. It is hoped the instrument will be able to find tiny traces of methane, a short lived gas, in the atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Curiosity's robot arm has also been tested on the surface of the red planet, as this stunning image shows . As it needs to be replenished, this would give clues to life on the red planet. Researchers will use a super-sensitive analysis machine to search for it. 'When Sam is at its best it can measure various parts per trillion of . methane, and the expected amounts based on measurements taken from orbit . around Mars and from Earth telescopes should be in the 10 to a few 10s . of parts per billion,' said Curiosity deputy principal scientist Joy Crisp. The gas has recently been observed by satellite and by Earth telescopes. It is the first time that the chemistry of the atmosphere has been tested from the surface of the planet since the Viking landers in the 1970s. It found CO2 is the main component of Martian air. However, Nasa says analysis may take a little more time. 'It's so early in the use of Sam, which is a complicated instrument, and we have to sort through the data,' said Crisp. Nasa engineers have also begun testing the rover's robotic arm. Nasa also released new engineering pictures showing the location of Curiosity's robot arm, which has five joints. 'We will be putting the arm through a range of motions and placing it at important 'teach points' that were established during Earth testing, such as the positions for putting sample material into the inlet ports for analytical instruments,"" said Daniel Limonadi of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 'These activities are important to get a better understanding for how the arm functions after the long cruise to Mars and in the different temperature and gravity of Mars, compared to earlier testing on Earth.' Since the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft placed Curiosity inside Mars' Gale Crater on Aug. 5, it has driven a total of 358 feet (109 meters). The drives have brought it about one-fourth of the way from the landing site, named Bradbury Landing, to a location selected as the mission's first major science destination, Glenelg. 'We knew at some point we were going to need to stop and take a week or so for these characterization activities,' said JPL's Michael Watkins, Curiosity mission manager. 'For these checkouts, we need to turn to a particular angle in relation to the sun and on flat ground. 'We could see before the latest drive that this looked like a perfect spot to start these activities.' The arm can be extended to pick up samples from the Martian surface .","First time martian atmosphere has been tested since Viking in the 1970s .

The key factor which separated man from our evolutionary rivals 100,000 years ago may not have been language - but instead a mysterious plague. The plague ravaged populations of early humans in Africa, until just 5-10,000 were left. But from that small population, humans emerged - and triumphed over other evolutionary cousins such as Neanderthals. Neanderthal man: The key factor which separated man from our evolutionary rivals 100,000 years ago may not have been language - but instead a mysterious plague . The bug attacked small infants and newborns, causing symptoms similar to sepsis or meningitis. But suriving it seems to have conveyed a key advantage. Soon afterwards, homo sapiens expanded dramatically in numbers, and spread all over the Earth. Researchers found that human populations today have 'dropped' two genes which related primates - apes - have, which could have left early man vulnerable to infections. The infections are related to modern bugs such as E Coli. ‘The modern bugs can still bind and could potentially have altered immune reactions,’ said Ajit Varki, MD, professor of medicine at UC San Diego . 'Though it is impossible to discern . exactly what happened during evolution, the investigators studied . molecular signatures surrounding these genes to hypothesize that . predecessors of modern humans grappled with a massive pathogenic menace . between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. E coli: ¿The modern bugs can still bind and could potentially have altered immune reactions,¿ said Ajit Varki, MD, professor of medicine at UC San Diego . 'This presumed ‘selective sweep’ would have devastated their numbers. Only individuals with certain gene . mutations survived – the tiny, emergent population of anatomically . modern humans that would result in everyone alive today possessing a . non-functional Siglec-17 gene and a missing Siglec-13 gene.' It's widely known that 100,000 years ago, human evolution reached a mysterious bottleneck. The cause of the bottleneck remains unsolved, with proposed answers ranging from gene mutations to cultural developments like language to climate-altering events, among them a massive volcanic eruption. ‘In a small, restricted population, a single mutation can have a big effect,’ said senior author. ‘We've found two genes that are non-functional in humans, but not in related primates, which could have been targets for bacterial pathogens particularly lethal to newborns and infants. 'Killing the very young can have a major impact upon reproductive fitness. Species survival can then depend upon either resisting the pathogen or on eliminating the target proteins it uses to gain the upper hand.’ ‘Genome sequencing can provide powerful insights into how organisms evolve, including humans,’ said co-author Eric D. Green, MD, PhD, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health. The scientists ‘resurrected’ these ‘molecular fossils’ and found that the proteins were recognized by current pathogenic strains of E. coli and Group B Streptococci. ‘The modern bugs can still bind and could potentially have altered immune reactions,’ Varki said. ‘Speciation (the process of evolving new species from existing ones) is driven by many things,’ he said. ‘We think infectious agents are one of them.’","Mysterious plague reduced human numbers to just 5,000-10,000 .

RIGHT now, at a time where gold, silver and bronze medals dominate world news, it's easy to forget about the Medal of Honor franchise. But Medal of Honor: Warfighter is game that is hard to ignore. Players resume control of another Tier 1 Operator, dispatched to various scenarios across the globe. What a view: Using the power of Frostbite 2, graphics have never looked better . There's an over-arching story line which was penned by actual Tier 1 Operators, drawing on their experiences when they were deployed overseas. The original characters from the previous game, including Mother, Preacher and Voodoo will return, too. The graphics are superb, and run of an enhanced version of the Frostbite 2 engine – the powerhouse behind Battlefield 3. They provide a grittiness that was missing in its predecessor. On one level, for example, the player had to order in an airstrike to take down an enemy position - the destructible environments on full show. Particle and lighting effects are top-notch, and already look far more impressive than Battlefield 3. Everything from the sunlight piercing through clouds of ash, to the flashlights emanating from enemies' rifles, look almost photo realistic. Animation from non-playable characters is spot on, too. They'll scramble from cover desperately or try and flush you out with grenades. They move like ‘real’ humans, stumbling around and crashing into things, really helping to bring the battlefield alive. Son of a breacher man: You can choose your tactics depending on what's best . Weapons will be standard fare, including rocket launchers, various assault rifles and close-quarters weapons. One cool gadget revealed in the demo was an unmanned robot - sent into areas decimated by air strikes to mop up any remaining baddies. It's a nice touch, although very similar to unmanned vehicle you get to play with in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Another COD-inspired touch is the breach system. Here you line up outside a door and pick how to enter the room. You may want to breach the door and go in with a shotgun. Or, toss a flash grenade in and pick off your targets with a pistol. The choice is yours. Multiplayer has had an overhaul, too. There are 12 forces – based on Tier One Operators around the world. Each one will have its own weapons, outfits, tactics and support options. The big new feature, though, is the Fire Team mode. Here, you can join up with a friend and take on the maps together, sharing health and ammo. Weapons free! You'll get to use various real-world weapons, including this beast . You’ll even earn XP for watching out for you buddy, with nifty features like an ability to see your ‘friend’ through a wall ensuring the mechanic avoids becoming confusing. If one of you is shot, the other can get him back in the game immediately by killing off the culprit. It’s due for release on October 26.

Game of Thrones on Blu-Ray: The new discs offer sharper HD resolutions which are supposed to look better on televisions . It was supposed to be the technology that revolutionised how we viewed films in the home. Blu-Ray was hailed for its superior sound and picture quality, as well as the multitude of additional features available on the discs - a fact that is reflected in the price. But it seems that many people can’t in fact tell the difference compared with DVDs when watching the film. Some 39 per cent of those questioned said they simply couldn't tell a difference in picture quality. The new discs offer sharper HD resolutions, which are supposed to look better on televisions. But even after six years on sale, they remain unpopular next to lower-resolution DVDs. On top of that, 81 per cent said they did not even have a Blu-Ray player and were still using DVDs. Many will feel the difference in quality is not enough to justify the difference in pric, with Blu-Rays usually selling for around £20, while DVDs can be bought for as little as £4 these days. The poll results will be embarrassing for Sony which spent millions developing Blu-Ray technology. It has been the next generation video technology of choice since 2008 when it beat Toshiba’s HD-DVD in a battle which recalled the war between VHS and Betamax over video players. But tech bloggers have long speculated that past a certain point viewers just don’t care about the extra quality and don’t want to pay a premium for it. A poll of 1,348 British consumers found they are yet to be convinced by Blu-Ray technology and 53 per cent think that it is overpriced. Their concerns appear to be justified - on Amazon.co.uk a DVD copy of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is £12.97 whilst the Blu-Ray version is £15. The poll also found that of the 19 per cent of people who have bought into Blu-Ray technology own just three discs. Even extras such as 3D (this Samsung player is capable of playing 3D Blu-Rays) have failed to ignite public imagination . By contrast, 38 per cent of all people who were quizzed said they owned more than 100 DVDs. A further 44 per cent said that they own between 70 to 100 DVDs. Those who are prepared to buy into Blu-Ray do indeed get a far superior picture. Blu-Ray’s maximum screen resolution is 1,920x1,080 (1080p), while DVD is limited to 720x480 (480p). Blu-Ray has richer colours and more contrast because it uses superior video-compression methods. It also has better audio and more features such as menus you can access whilst your film is playing. Normally with a DVD you have to stop the film first. The study found that another reason for the lack of take-up is the rise in online film streaming services which means people are buying fewer and fewer hard copies of films . The poll was carried out by MyVoucherCodes.","81% of those polled said they still used DVDs .

Facebook's stock fell 7 percent, or $1.49, to $19.71 in Thursday morning trading. If the stock hits $19, it will have lost half its value since Facebook went public in May. The firm has faced huge problems since going public. After one of the most anticipated initial public stock offerings in history, Facebook Inc. suffered what some experts said was the most-botched IPO as trading glitches marred its first day. In all, 271 million shares become eligible for sale Thursday, on top of the 421 million already trading. Insiders say it is conceivable no one would sell those extra shares, but if too many do, Facebook's stock could decline even further. Firms ranging from Accel Partners to Goldman Sachs, Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Facebook board members James Breyer, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman are among those free to sell stock they own . Facebook's operating chief Sheryl Sandberg and finance chief David Ebersman are also now eligible to sell stock they own. Microsoft Corp., an early Facebook investor, is another one, though it's unlikely to sell because of partnerships it has with Facebook. Facebook's share price could hits its lowest price today as investors will be eligible to sell stock as their 'lock in' period ends. Lock-ups prevent company insiders from selling their shares in a . newly-floated firm. They usually start to expire 90 days from the initial . public offering (IPO). They are designed to prevent the share price from fluctuating . wildly if too many investors decide to sell their shares all at once. It's not yet known whether anyone had sold shares. The stock price decline could reflect investor anticipation of such a move. Other shareholders, including many Facebook employees, will be able to sell beginning in October. On November 14, co-founder and chief . executive Mark Zuckerberg will be able to sell shares. Tom Forte, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, told the Guardian he expected more volatility in Facebook's share price in the short term. I'm a glass half-full man on Facebook,' he said. 'In the near term I expect increasing pressure on the share price as more shares come unlocked.

It wasn't long before the space western picked up numerous awards, including Game Of The Year, for seamlessly blending role-playing elements with traditional first-person gunplay. Borderlands 2 is set five years after the events of its predecessor. Back then, the vault hunters exposed the secrets of the Eridian Vault. All hands on deck: You can team-up with friends to take on waves of enemies . The main baddie is Handsome Jack who has taken the credit for the vault hunters' hard work and claimed the wealth from the vault, allowing him to take control of the Hyperion Cooperation and effectively Pandora, too. The Cooperation has taken the vault hunters hostage, so your mission is to save them and kill Handsome Jack in the process. Like in the previous game, there are four playable characters. First up is Salvador, nicknamed 'Gunzerker' who can duel-wield any combination of guns. Borderlands is known for having millions of weapons - all of which are customisable. It's great to have a character that can carry loads and really make the most out of a fantastic armory. Then there's the Siren, Maya, who has the ability to phase lock. This is basically lifting an enemy up in the air and making them an easy target. Sound of the Siren: Maya has some cool powers . Finally, there's a commando called Axton who relies on turrets and an assassin called Zero, who uses a sword and a gun to unleash a critical hit on his foes. There's also a character called the Mechromancer - which is due to come out post launch as DLC content. It's free for people who pre-order the game. Its main ability is to summon a robot called Deathtrap who goes on a rampage killing everybody in sight. Borderlands impressed critics with its cell-shaded, quirky graphics depicting a Mad Max-style world for the player to explore. But things have been upgraded this time around. Visuals look sharper and characters seem more richly detailed. Draw distance, as always, is impressive, which helps immerse you in the world. Borderlands is at its best as a cooperative shooter. Here, you can team up with friends and take on missions together sharing loot and weapons. Like the original, there are lots of vehicles available to make the most of the mechanic. What's brilliant this time around are the large boss fights - which are similar to those found in games such as the Monster Hunter series. We watched as a team took on a huge beast, which tried to splatter them all with its ferocious tentacles. Levelling up is key here and inexperienced players will die very quickly. Weird and wonderful: The world of Pandora has been made even more pretty . Don't expect the boss fights to be short, either. Developers Gearbox Software have mentioned some can last up to 20mins - with even the slightest of mistakes resulting in total annihilation. We can't wait for this one.

The structure of the observable universe . suggests there is a lot of matter that we simply cannot see, and astronomers, cosmologists and particle physicists have . been looking for answers to what it could be. But now the ESA Planck satellite has picked up radiation beams from the centre of the Milky Way, and scientists believe they have discovered proof that dark mater exists - otherwise the alternative would re-write physics as we know it. Pavel Naselsky, professor of cosmology at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen, said: 'The radiation cannot be explained by the . structural mechanisms in the galaxy and it cannot be radiation from . supernova explosions. 'We believe that this could be proof of dark . matter. Otherwise, we have discovered absolutely new (and unknown for . physics) mechanism of acceleration of particles in the Galactic centre.' Radiation map of the skies: A false colour image of the whole sky as seen by Planck, the space observatory . In this image, the dust of the Milky Way is shown in blue, with a red band across the centre showing hot regions. The mottled yellow area above and below represents relic radiation, otherwise known as the Cosmic Microwave Background, created in the fireball of the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago, which is the oldest light in the Universe. Such an image allows scientists to study both the origins of the Universe and the birth of stars in our galaxy. Researchers were studying data from the Planck satellite, launched in 2009. The satellite does not just remain still in space, but changes direction every hour as well as rotates once a minute on its own axis. These movements mean that it scans the entire surrounding Universe in the course of six months, using extremely sensitive instruments that can map microwave radiation in the entire sky with great precision. The latest data from the Planck mission reveals unusual radiation from our own galaxy, which open a new direction in understanding the most fundamental properties of the space, time and matter in the Universe. Naselsky said: 'We have observed a very unique emission of radio radiation from the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way. 'By using different methods to separate the signal for very broad range of wavelengths, we have been able to determine the spectrum of the radiation. 'The radiation originates from synchrotron emission - electrons and positrons circulating at high energies around the lines of the Magnetic Field in the centre of the galaxy, and there are quite strong indications that it could come from dark matter.' Planck produced its first all-sky image in 2010, and scientists are currently working to analyse and parse the various and complex elements . Naselsky said that leading scientists like Niels Bohr professor Subir Sarkar have predicted, using calculations, that dark matter may consist of very heavy particles that are around 10 times as heavy as the Higgs particle, that is to say, 1,000 times heavier than a proton. But they have very unique properties and do not interact with ‘normal’ matter particles. Dark matter particles are also usually very scattered and do not interact with each other. 'But we know from theoretical predictions that the concentration of dark matter particles around the centre of galaxies is very high and we have a strong argument they can collide there and in the collision electrons and positrons are formed. 'These electrons and positrons start to rotate around the magnetic field at the centre of the galaxy and in doing so produce this very unusual synchrotron radiation. It has simply not been possible to observe this radiation in such detail before, as previous instruments have not been sensitive enough. But with Planck, this unusual radiation is seen very clearly.' The results have been published in ArXive.org. and submitted to the scientific journal, Astronomy and Astrophysics.","Planck satellite picks up beams of radiation from centre of Milky Way which could prove existence of 'dark matter'

Rose Jones, 53, pocketed more than £135,000 of taxpayers’ money after convincing authorities she was unsteady on her feet, bedridden and unable to work. She claimed . Incapacity Benefit and Disability Living Allowance for suffering a spinal condition that left her immobile, on a variety of painkillers and battling the effects of a stroke which left her unable to sit in a chair, climb stairs and incontinent. Remorseful mum: After leaving court today with sister Pearl Van Aalst (left), Mrs Jones' daughter Deborah Jones (right) said her mother knows she did wrong by pocketing over £135,000 in benefits while scuba diving . Her husband, former Paratrooper Reginald Jones, 53, claimed £5,351 in Carer’s Allowance and £15,975 in Working Tax Credits as he struggled to set up a dog grooming company and needed the money to help meet his bills. In reality, the couple who lived in Ramsgate, Kent at the time,  were living a lavish lifestyle travelling to exotic locations including the Maldives, Indonesia and Osnabruck, Germany for scuba diving courses funded by benefits over 16 years. Mr Jones, from Dover, Kent, was sentenced 18 months in jail and Mrs Jones, who had been residing in Germany, for 15 months. The couple, who have since broken up, were jailed by Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl at Canterbury Crown Court today. The couple's daughter Deborah Jones, 29, said her mother was remorseful. She said: “My mum is so remorseful. She understands she has done wrong - that is why she owned up and pleaded guilty. 'But she was pressured into it by him (Mr Jones). He is not my father. I have disowned him. Secret trips: Mrs Jones' now ex-husband claimed she went on secret diving trips with scuba diving instructor Udo Kefrig (pictured centre with Mrs Jones' daughter Ms Van Aalst and Ms Jones) 'She is so ashamed of herself. She says she wished she had been strong enough to leave my father sooner.' Mr Jones told the jury his wife went on secret scuba diving and skiing trips behind his back to Abu Dhabi, Egypt and Panama with scuba diving instructor Udo Kefrig who had become her lover. Mrs Jones walked out on her husband in 2010 and now lives with Mr Kefrig in Germany. Judge Van Der Biyl said they had ‘gilded the lily’ to get benefits for which they were not entitled to. He said: ‘Both were fully involved in this joint enterprise. ‘The department works on trust and cannot be expected to check every case, they have to rely on what people tell them.’ Far from being unable to work, Mrs Jones was employed from March 1996 until February 2000 by a care homes company in Margate. She then held down two full-time jobs at the same time, one as a caretaker and one as a concierge. Helen Guest, prosecuting, told the jury that from 1994 to 2010 the couple kept up the pretence to officials that Mrs Jones was unable to work because of her crippling condition. Bedridden: In official documents Mrs Jones claimed she could not walk 50 metres or open a bottle of wine all while she was photographed scuba diving (model in photo) In one official document Mrs Jones wrote: ‘I cannot bend or kneel or pick up a piece of paper from the floor. Have problems sitting in a chair for five minutes and back tends to lock and it hurts to get up. ‘I am bedridden, my back condition is deteriorating, I cannot walk for more than 50 metres without stopping or feeling severe discomfort. I have problems with stairs and am also unable to open a bottle of wine.’ The court heard Mrs Jones informed authorities she could not wash and dress without the help of her husband ‘because my back locks’. In 1997 she claimed she suffered from ‘a severe back/spinal and nerve pain, which goes down both legs and thighs into my toes. Had spinal back operations’. Mrs Jones did have back problems but they did not qualify for disability benefits, the court heard. Ms Guest said: ‘Mrs Jones was clearly capable of working managing to hold down two jobs simultaneously for a significant period.’ The couple also owned a motor home complete with personalised number plate B1G REG. When fraud officers raided the couple’s home Mr Jones asked: ‘What am I supposed to have done?’ Mrs Jones admitted 10 offences of cheating taxpayers and was found guilty on two others. Mr Jones, who now works as a paramedic, was convicted on seven fraud charges after the 11-day trial.","Rose Jones, 53, pocketed a disability allowance for 16 years claiming she was bedridden and unable to work .

Rod Thomas and Roger Holmes have spent hundreds of hours breathing life into 'Flossie', an ICT 1301 mainframe that cost £250,000 - or £4.2million today - in 1962.

Despite being 25 square feet and weighing five tons 'Flossie' is only 1/10 as powerful as a modern-day smart phone and has roughly the same power as a digital wristwatch. It featured as a prop in the climax of the 1974 Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun, starring Roger Moore. The scientists believe they need another six months to recover the computer's software - which they believe will offer a fascinating insight into the birth of the British computer industry. But their plans could be scuppered if a new home cannot be found for 'Flossie'. The old computer is currently housed in a shed on a farm in Kent, with the owners in the process of selling the property. All of the data the computer has inside it would fit onto 1/3 of a CD.

Parkes, of Bishops Cleeve, Cheltenham, today appeared at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court and admitted a charge of racially aggravated criminal damage and a public order offence. He is due to be sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court later this month. The head was left tied to the mosque on November 13, 2010. A spokesman for Cheltenham Mosque said: 'This was a very shocking incident, not just for those who attend the mosque but the wider community as well. 'We would like to thank the police, the council and local neighbours for their tremendous amount of support. Adjourned: Parkes is due to be sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court .

Referring to the gold medal achievement of team member Gabby Douglas last week, Camerota said: 'Gabby had that great moment, everybody was so excited and she’s in hot pink.' Scroll down for video . Pretty in pink: The U.S. women's gymnastics team, led by Gabby Douglas, became the subject of critique when Fox News called their nationalism into question after they wore pink in competition . Dress debate: Saying that how Douglas dresses is 'her prerogative,' America Live host Alisyn Camerota, left, invited her guest, radio host David Webb, right, to weigh in . Though she added that how Douglas dresses is ‘her prerogative,’ Camerota invited her guest, radio host David Webb, to weigh in. Webb - who co-founded advocacy organisation Tea Party 365, said that the team’s dress is an example of a slight ‘anti-American feeling.' ‘What’s wrong with showing pride?’ he asked. Pulling out a miniature American flag, Webb said: ‘Wear it. Wave it. Be proud to be an American. It’s not a political issue, but they make it a social issue.' Star-spangled: The U.S. womens gymnastics team wore uniforms emblazoned with the American flag when they competed in the 1996 Atlanta games . Criticism: Webb, who co-founded advocacy organisation Tea Party 365, said that the team's dress is an example of a slight 'anti-American feeling' Webb added: 'The Chinese are wearing red predominantly as that’s their national colour if you will.

You know, the blood that’s been shed... that’s what we need to focus on and get that out in our country.'

The critique of the gymnastics team's dress came as Douglas, 16, fended herself from a Twitter uproar over the way she styles her hair while she's competing. She said yesterday that she was confused when she logged onto her computer after winning her second gold medal in three days to find that people were debating about her pulled-back look. 'I don't know where this is coming from. What's wrong with my hair?' said Douglas, the first U.S. gymnast to win gold in team and all-around competition. 'I'm like, ""I just made history and people are focused on my hair?"" It can be bald or short, it doesn't matter about [my] hair.' Winner: The teenager, above, became the fourth straight American to win gymnastics' biggest prize . Douglas uses gel, clips and a ponytail holder to keep things in place while she competes, a style she's worn for years. 'Nothing is going to change,' she . said. 'I'm going to wear my hair like this during beam and bar finals. You might as well just stop talking about it.' Critics . have argued that her dark locks should in fact mimic the tight, . ballerina-style bun that gymnasts usually tuck their hair into.

Quoted by the BBC, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said: 'Today South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visited Takeshima.

Paralysed: Glennroy Blair-Ford was on  a week of outdoor activities when he broke his neck welly wanging . A teacher left paralysed after breaking his neck in a welly-wanging  accident on a school trip has lost  his High Court claim for more than  £5million in damages. Glennroy Blair-Ford, 45, was on an activities week with secondary school pupils on Dartmoor when he took part in a ‘mini-Olympics’ on the final evening. One of the games involved children throwing wellington boots as far as they could,  with the task made more difficult for teachers, who had to throw backwards through their legs. But Mr Blair-Ford, who is 6ft tall and  then weighed 15st, lost his balance as he swung the wellington and was propelled head-first to the ground with no way of breaking his fall. The former head of design and technology at Wilmington Enterprise College in Dartford, Kent, was left catastrophically injured after fracturing his neck and will spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. He is on a ventilator for 23 hours a day and lives in a residential nursing facility several miles from his family’s home in Bromley, Kent. Describing the moment when he fell, the teacher said: ‘When my head hit the ground I had a strange sensation, like my body  was shutting down, like a switch was  flicked. I couldn’t feel anything and I couldn’t move.’ Mr Blair-Ford, who is a devout Christian  and father of two, had sued the CRS Adventures centre in Devon, where he was injured in April 2007. Tragic: Glennroy Blair-Ford was on a week of outdoor activities with his secondary school pupils on Dartmoor in April 2007 when he took part in a 'Mini Olympics' event on the final night . Denies . liability: The accident happened at CRS Adventures Limited in Dartmoor . (pictured) in April 2007 but the company say the injury was not . foreseeable . The court heard he had been ‘fit and well’ when he went on the trip with four fellow staff and 40 pupils aged 11 to 14. His legal team argued he had been asked by centre staff to throw the wellington boot adopting an ‘unsafe’ method. They contended his injuries were ‘a logical and foreseeable consequence’ of a man of Mr Blair-Ford’s size and weight throwing the welly using the method. CRS had failed in its duty of care by not carrying out an assessment of the risks and if it had done so ‘the method of throw would have been modified’, they said. His solicitor Rebecca Dixon said: ‘Mr Blair-Ford faces a very difficult future. Thrown out: One of the games involved children and adults throwing wellington boots as far as they could, with the teachers handicapped by having to throw backwards through their legs . School: . Mr Blair-Ford was a teacher at Wilmington Enterprise College, now . called Wilmington Academy. The devout Christian now lives in a nursing . home . ‘He will never be able to work and is reliant on state funding for his significant medical and equipment needs.’ But Mr Justice Globe yesterday rejected the claim, ruling: ‘Extremely sad though it may be, this was a tragic and freak accident for which no blame can be established.’ ‘On the evidence I have heard, the risk of injury was not such that steps should have been taken to guard against it. ‘In my judgment, the evidence of its likelihood was indeed “lacking such reality that it could be disregarded” and was at most “a mere possibility which would never influence the mind of a reasonable man”.’ Mr Blair-Ford and his insurers now face a large legal bill. The judge ordered an interim payment of £100,000 to CRS pending a final assessment of the amount.","Glennroy Blair-Ford swung his boot and was propelled head first to the ground .

Internet pirate: Anton Vickerman, 38, arrives at Newcastle Crown Court, where he was jailed for four years today for conspiracy to defraud . An internet pirate who banked up to £60,000 a month from a site which shared links to downloadable TV shows and films was jailed for four years today. Anton Vickerman's surfthechannel.com website attracted 400,000 visitors a day at its peak and was close to the top 500 most popular websites. But it cost the film industry tens of millions of pounds in lost revenue, and ultimately huge losses to the Inland Revenue, the prosecution alleged. The site provided browsers with links to films, sometimes before they were released in cinemas. Volunteers searched the net for links and moderators checked the titles were usable before posting them on the site. Vickerman, 38, originally from Gateshead but whose latest address was Citygate, Newcastle, valued the site at £400,000 when he offered it for sale in 2008. Over two years the site, run by the former DJ and BT employee's firm Scopelight, turned over £1million with a profit of £250,000, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Vickerman was jailed after being convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud in June. Judge John Evans told him: 'Ultimately films will not be made if the producers cannot make them at a profit.' He added that the public may suffer from piracy by having to pay more to watch films at the cinema. Ari Alibhai, prosecuting, said Vickerman made between £12,000 and £60,000 a month from advertising on his site. 'It is clear that the website, due to its popularity, was accruing hundreds of thousands of pounds,' the he said. In July 2008 surfthechannel.com was listed 514 in an index of most popular websites, Mr Alibhai said, which at the time made it more popular than social network Facebook. He added that the losses the site caused to the film industry were impossible to calculate. Download site: Surfthechannel.com allowed access to more than 5,600 films and TV shows . It was revealed that surfthechannel.com allowed access to more than 5,600 films and TV shows. Experts have estimated the damages to be between £52million and £198million, depending on how lost sales are estimated. 'Once one reaches figures of tens of millions of pounds of loss it becomes irrelevant what the figure is,' Mr Alibhai said. 'The scale of loss was immense and it does run to tens of millions of pounds. 'Due to the number of films available and the frequency they were downloaded the scale of loss is considerable. 'And the losses should not just be seen as a loss to moguls in Hollywood but to hundreds of people in the industry.' Money spinner: Mr Vickerman walks to court with a concerned looking companion. Over two years his site generated turned over £1million with a profit of £250,000, Newcastle Crown Court heard . Judge Evans said the losses would have also stretched beyond the film and music industry. He said: 'The loss is considerable but also there is here the loss of tax revenue because if the industry was generating this kind of revenue then it would have been shared with a net benefit to the taxpayer.' Defiant: Mr Vickerman flashes a 'peace' hand signal at photographers . Vickerman's wife Kelly, who had faced the same charges, was cleared by the jury. The court was told that since then their relationship had broken down due in part to the stress of the case. David Walbank, defending, said: 'The overwhelming strain has contributed to the break down of his marriage. 'The proceedings sounded the death knell of their marriage.' But Judge Evans said it was in fact Vickerman's obsession with his website that had contributed to his marriage failing. He said: 'Had you told your wife about what you were doing she would have done her best to stop you. 'It was an obsession with the popularity of your website which contributed to the break up of your marriage.' Mr Walbank also said the case had left Vickerman financially ruined. He said: 'You know a great deal about him and know that he has already paid a great deal. 'It has left him financially ruined and he currently owes about £50,000 in contributions. 'He is personally insolvent and the likelihood is that he will be declared bankrupt.'","Anton Vickerman, 38, ran TV and film download site surfthechannel.com .

The ad ran in Ohio, Florida, Colorado and Ryan’s home . state Wisconsin. Fighting: The ad attacks US Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney (right) and his vice presidential running mate Paul Ryan (left) In their first joint interview, with CBS News, Romney and Ryan defends their stance on Medicare. Ryan said: ‘My mom is a Medicare senior in Florida. ‘Our point is we need to preserve their benefits, because government made promises to them that they've organised their retirements around. In order to make sure we can do that, you must reform it for those of us who are younger. And we think these reforms are good reforms.’ Romney said: ‘There's only one president that I know of in history that robbed Medicare, $716 billion to pay for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare. ‘What Paul Ryan and I have talked about is saving Medicare, is providing people greater choice in Medicare, making sure it's there for current seniors. No changes, by the way, for current seniors, or those nearing retirement. Battle: Romney's campaign has released ads criticising Obama . But looking for young people down the road and saying, “We're going to give you a bigger choice”. In America, the nature of this country has been giving people more freedom, more choices. That's how we make Medicare work down the road.’ Wasserman Schultz said that she had not one but two parents living in Florida and on Medicare. ‘Both my parents are on Medicare and live in Florida too and I can tell you that my parents and hundreds of thousands of seniors that I represent are deeply concerned that Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney want to turn Medicare into a voucher programme.’ Medicare, she said, was ‘a guarantee for seniors that there is going to be a safety net through which we’re not going to allow them to fall’. Romney and Ryan had ‘embraced ending that guarantee – Paul Ryan’s the architect of ending it’. Watch the videos here: .","Designed to paint Ryan as a callous extremist .

A former racing driver and close friend of Lewis Hamilton died following an horrific 78mph crash at a roundabout following a night out drinking with friends. Christian Bakkerud, a 26-year-old Dane, suffered fatal head injuries when his silver Audi RS6 ‘beast of a car’ was hurled through the air and torn to pieces. The car smashed into a barrier before somersaulting through the air and landing on top of a metre high wall which ripped the suspension away. Tragic: Danish race driver Christian Bakkerud, left, who was a close friend of Lewis Hamilton, right, died following an horrific 78mph crash following a night out with friends . It finally came to rest on top of a railing which bent what was left of the car in half, Westminster Coroner’s Court heard. Mr Bakkerud had competed in the British Formula Three and Hamilton wore his initials on his helmet after his death as a tribute. PC Peter Traylor told the court that Mr Bakkerud’s car left behind a scene of devastation with car parts littering the road. He added: ‘When you look at the car itself, it is capable of 150mph. In January 2010 it was described at Audi’s single most powerful car. ‘It is a beast of a car, it’s got all the safety features you can imagine.’ PC Traylor said there was no evidence Mr Bakkerud had applied the brakes. Fatal: The horrific collision took place on Tibbets Corner, Putney, pictured . ‘When you look at somebody taking that sort corner you will get to the left hand side to flatten out the corner,’ he explained. ‘If Mr Bakkerud was on a race track he would be doing the same kind of lines to get around a bend, but he wasn’t doing that in this case,’ he added. PC Traylor explained that CCTV stills showed the former championship driver positioned in the middle of the road before the collision in Tibbets Corner, Putney, on September 10. Mr Bakkerud was taken to St George’s Hospital in Tooting after a passer-by called the emergency services who found him unconscious at the scene. He was found to be suffering from severe head injuries including a fractured skull and swelling of the brain. He also suffered fractured vertebrae and internal injuries. Mr Bakkerud never regained consciousness and died in hospital the following day. The court heard that he had been out the night before the crash drinking with friends and celebrating a birthday. Close: Lewis Hamilton honoured Christian Bakkerud by putting his initials on his helmet in the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix . Mr Bakkerud was planning to drive down to his parents’ house in Esher that night . Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: ‘We heard that Christian Bakkerud, only 26 years of age, his occupation at the time of his death was that of a shipping broker. ‘But as we have heard from officer Traylor, of some significance is the fact that he was previously a racing car driver and a racing car driver that was well known in the racing world and successful. ‘He had an extremely powerful car. He did race cars for Audi and presumably they had given him one of these cars to thank him for the services he had provided for them,’ she added. ‘Now we know that on September 9, 2011, Mr Bakkerud went out with some friends for dinner, some alcohol was drunk over the course of the evening.’ Talented: Mr Bakkerud's last race was at the gruelling 24-hour race in Le Mans, France. This is a file picture of the race . Mr Bakkerud’s blood was never tested for alcohol but friends insisted he was not drunk. ‘One can only imagine the type of forces acting on Mr Bakkerud during the course of the collision,’ the coroner added. ‘Unusually, with such a high performance car it was matched by a high performance driver. ‘Mr Bakkerud had been previously a racing car driver, he was used to driving these sorts of cars and indeed driving Audis in particular. So it was not a matter of driver’s ability and a mismatch of the car. ‘We will never know what part alcohol played in this incident. We don’t know if Mr Bakkerud drifted off to sleep or lost momentary concentration. I am afraid we would stray into speculation. ‘What we do know is that it has been a tragic loss of a young life’ she added. She described the pictures of the crash scene as being ‘the most remarkable’ she had seen in her career. Before retiring from motor sport last year, he had raced in Formula BMW, British Formula 3 and GP2 (the level below Formula 1). His career highlight was a British F3 win for Carlin at Mugello in 2006. Mr Bakkerud’s last race was at the gruelling 24-hour race in Le Mans, France, which he was unable to finish after crashing out in 32nd place. Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton paid tribute to his friend by wearing his initials on his helmet during the Singapore Grand Prix which took place on September 25. Mr Bakkerud of Notting Hill, west London died of multiple injuries. The verdict was accidental death. Following the inquest, Mr Bakkerud’s family released a statement. They said: 'We have lost our son, a happy and smiling man who was a key part of our lives, and an upcoming responsible husband to his fiancée. Christian was popular with a lot of people and had many friends. 'At the funeral the church was full of friends, loved ones and highly regarded colleagues in motorsports. They flew in from across the world, a thing which really moved us. 'All those who know and have worked with Christian in international motorsports will know what a talented driver he was. Christian was well-known and respected; he was a safe and well regarded racing driver known for his patience and respect of other drivers. 'He prided himself on discipline, and always worked with the upmost responsibility. He conducted his life with balance and respect, and he will be greatly missed by all who knew him.'","Christian Bakkerud .

Homeward bound: Bella the dog survived a 100ft cliff fall and then walked back to the holiday home she had only been to once before . The lucky Labrador's incredible homing instinct saw her trudge one mile to the unfamiliar property having escaped the death-defying tumble . The 15-month-old black dog plunged off the cliff as she chased after a seagull while out for a walk with Chris, 68, at Peveril Point, near Swanage, Dorset. She bounced down the sloping rock face before coming to rest in one piece on the beach below. Chris Sexton (68) from Salisbury, was out searching the cliffs for Bella when his wife Jo (68) called to say the clever dog had arrived home safe and well . Chris, a retired company director, raced down to the bottom but found no sign of Bella, who had climbed back up the cliff to begin her incredible journey. She walked along the South West Coast Path and then made her way down several residential streets until she found the family's holiday home in Swanage.

Chris said his wife Jo, 68, had been distraught after hearing the news but was overjoyed when Bella turned up. Simon Williams, of Portland coastguard, said: 'The owner searched the cliffs for about 15 minutes before we were alerted.

The body of a woman migrant who is believed to have tried to get into Britain by swimming to Dover has been discovered on a beach in northern France. The illegal immigrant who was wearing a wetsuit and was carrying a compass and energy food bars is thought to have drowned and been washed back ashore after attempting the hazardous 21-mile crossing. The unidentified Asian woman, thought to be in her thirties, also had spare clothes in a plastic pouch and was smeared with vaseline to keep out the cold during the swim through the world's busiest shipping lane. Grim discovery: The body of an Asian woman migrant who is believed to have attempted to swim across the Channel from France to the UK was discovered on a beach close to Boulogne (file photo) Police in Calais said her body was found on a beach near the coastal town of Wimereux on Sunday evening. A Calais police spokeswoman added that it is the first death of its kind. An autopsy to determine the woman's cause of death was expected to be carried out yesterday. Boulogne public prosecutor Jean-Philippe Joubert said: 'The body was spotted by a passer-by on Sunday evening. 'She was wearing a wetsuit and still wet. We found clothes in a bag on cliffs above the beach. 'She was prepared for long distance swimming with vaseline on her skin to prevent irritations. 'She also had more clothes in a plastic bag underneath her wetsuit and a pocket contained energy food bars and a compass. Location: The swimmer was found near town of Wimereux . 'Swimming the Channel is a highly . dangerous thing to do and is only ever attempted by very experienced . swimmers with a support vessel.' There are thought to be around 1,000 illegal immigrants massed in northern France. Since socialist President Francois Hollande was elected in May, one new migrants’ camp – comprising wooden huts with showers and cooking facilities and dubbed a ‘mini-Sangatte’ – has been opened and others are likely to follow. The original Red Cross Sangatte camp was closed by Nicolos Sarkozy ten years ago when he was Minister of the Interior. A new law, to be debated in France in the autumn, could make it illegal to arrest UK-bound migrants entering Calais. It is feared this will unleash a fresh tide of migrants on the northern French coast hoping to sneak on to lorries and ferries to Britain. A film released three years ago . called Welcome centred on a Kurdish refugee who takes swimming lessons . before trying to swim to the Kent coast. It attracted harsh criticism for presenting the bid to breach border controls as a 'noble quest'. Echoes of real life: In 2009 a French director made a film called Welcome which told the story of a fictional migrant who tried to swim to Dover and drowned . A Calais police spokesman added: 'It . may have been depicted in a fictional film, but this is the first time . we have ever seen any illegal immigrant actually try to swim the . channel. 'Although there may have been successful attempts that we don't know about. 'In this case all the evidence points . to the fact the woman was one of the hundreds of refugees currently living . on the northern French coast. 'Initial tests show she died by drowning but a full post mortem examination is being carried out.' Two Russian migrants attempted to . reach Britain in a kayak 15 years ago, but they were intercepted by a . French coastguard vessel. A British cross-Channel swimmer died last month after coming within two miles of the French coast. The unnamed man in his 40s had swum 19 miles from Dover before falling ill within sight of Calais. Cross-Channel swimming attempts are banned in French territorial waters due to the heavy maritime traffic and strong currents. Captain Matthew Webb made the first . recorded unassisted swim across the Channel in 1875.

Detectives investigating the rape of a 14-year-old boy in a department store have been criticised for waiting more than 11 weeks before making a public appeal for information about the crime. An MP has questioned why it took police so long to release CCTV images of two suspects wanted for questioning over the attack, which happened in Manchester city centre on June 2. Greater Manchester Police only released the images yesterday - almost three months after the incident happened in a toilet in a Debenhams store. Tony Lloyd, the MP for Manchester Central and Labour's candidate for Greater Manchester's first police commissioner, said it was 'common sense' that issuing the pictures sooner would have helped the investigation. He said: 'There is unease about why it has taken so long for those pictures to be released. 'I think the police do have to give a detailed answer at to why this delay took place. 'It’s not easy in situations like this, [given] the need to respect the victim. 'But I think common sense tells most . people that early publication of CCTV both helps the police, because . members of the public hopefully come forward and help identify the . attacker, and of course, in the worse case, it would help prevent an . early repetition.' The boy's ordeal began when he used a public toilet in Manchester's Arndale Centre and became aware of two men staring at him. Scroll down for video . Suspects: Police released these CCTV images more than 11 weeks after the attack , which happened in a department store . Suddenly one of the men approached him and said: ‘Come with us, do what we say and if you try to run, we’ll get you.’ The boy was then frogmarched by the men – one white and the other Asian – out of the Arndale Centre in Manchester. Led by the arm, he was forcibly taken about 50 yards away to the nearby Debenhams store. As shoppers and staff walked around . the four-storey department store, oblivious to the boy’s ordeal, the . teenager was forced into a lift by the two men. He was taken by the lift upstairs, where he was marched into a men’s toilet and raped by the Asian man. Yesterday a police source said the attack was ‘absolutely horrendous’. Scene: The boy was raped in a toilet in this Debenhams store in Manchester city centre . The source said: ‘The attack on a . child in a busy department store on a Saturday afternoon will put fear . and dread into the heart of every parent. ‘If teenagers are not safe from paedophile predators in the heart of a busy city, then it is extremely worrying.’ The teenager reported the incident and was taken to a rape crisis centre at St Mary’s Hospital where he was checked by doctors. A team of officers has been working . with the traumatised victim to build up a picture of what happened and . to obtain forensic evidence. Greater Manchester Police said . the CCTV images of the men were circulated to local businesses and they . had waited for the results of forensic tests, which took some time to . complete. The force said it also had to wait for the boy to be video-interviewed before making a public appeal. Speaking as the CCTV images were . released, Detective Sergeant Liam Boden said: ‘This young victim has . been absolutely devastated by what happened to him. ‘What makes this incident doubly . shocking is that he was marched across a busy part of the city centre . during the late afternoon on Saturday. 'Devastated': The boy was attacked after being approached by two men in the Arndale Centre in Manchester . Investigation: Police are confident that Manchester shoppers may have seen the boy's attackers either before or after the incident . ‘However, this means I am confident that shoppers may have seen the offenders either before or after the incident. ‘I want people to take a good look at the men in these images and tell me who they are.’ His colleague, Superintendent Stuart . Ellison, said: ‘When you think about a 14-year-old out in the city . centre at that time of the evening, when the footfall is pretty heavy . and there are a lot of people about, the fact that someone could be . marched across the street and into a store in this way is pretty . horrific.’ He added that he found the attack . ‘particularly disturbing’, saying: ‘When I think about family or friends . who could have been out in the Arndale at that time of night, it . disturbs me greatly.’ A spokesman for Debenhams said: 'We were shocked to hear about this incident and would like to reassure everyone this is an isolated case.'","Boy, 14, was attacked in toilet of a Debenhams store in Manchester city centre on June 2 .

'Revenge': The prosecution were building a case against Aurora shooting suspect James Holmes that his actions were premeditated . James Holmes sent an ominous text message to a classmate he had tried awkwardly to flirt with: She should stay away from him. 'I'm bad news,' he wrote. Weeks before the movie theater shooting spree that killed 12 people and wounded 50 others, the University of Colorado-Denver student suggested he suffered from 'dysphoric mania,' an especially troubling form of bi-polar disorder. Worse, he seemed to say he had lost control of the mental disease. It has now emerged that relatives of . the people killed in the attack are due to hold a news conference on . Tuesday to discuss unspecified events they say need to be addressed. Anita Busch, a spokeswoman for the . group, said in a statement that they would 'speak with one voice' for . the benefit of all of the victims. She did not elaborate on the topics . to be discussed at the news conference, but said that she expected the . families of most of the 12 people killed to be represented. Meanwhile The New York Times reports how classmates watched James Holmes, 23, become more withdrawn and less stable in the weeks before his alleged attack on a midnight screening of the blockbuster Batman movie 'Dark Knight Rises.' One woman, who was part of the University of Colorado's neurosciences program along with Holmes, told the newspaper that the shy student seemed to fancy her and tried to clumsily flirt with her. He once sent her a text message in class that read 'Why are you distracting me with those shorts?' When she was absent from class with stomach flu, he seemed concerned. 'You still sick, girl?' he asked. Holmes was always a loner, always introverted and awkward, his classmates -- who talked to the Times anonymously -- said. However, they watched him become more isolated as the school year wound down. When he failed an oral exam in June, his professors suggested that perhaps he should drop out of the program. In March, prosecutors said last week, he told a student that he planned to 'kill people... and that he would do so when his life was over.' In July, just a few weeks before the July 20 theater rampage in Aurora, Holmes sent the girl another message. Chaos: People gathered outside the movie theatre following the shooting . Holmes reportedly saw three health professionals before he opened fire at the Aurora movie theater in July . Struggle: The family gathers at the cross nearby . to the cinema where their father was gunned down. In the foreground, a . family portrait shows Cowden and his children . He wanted to know if she had heard of dysphoric mania. She hadn't. She asked if treatment was controlling it. His startling answer: 'It was.' She needed to stay away from him, 'because I'm bad news,' he warned her. Dysphoric mania is a startling combination of depression -- despair, suicidal thoughts and even hallucinations and delusions -- and mania -- agitation, paranoia -- both at the same time. In severe cases, patients can suffer from a dangerous cocktail of delusion, paranoia, violent agitation and suicidal thoughts. Emotion: Ashley Deuell, 18, kneels next to a cross and family photo of Cowden, a friend of her family . It's not known whether dysphoric mania was the diagnosis Holmes' psychiatrist had given him or if he come up with it on his own. Holmes' attorney said during a previous . court hearing that he suffers from an unspecified mental illness and had . tried to get help, and local media have reported he saw at least three . mental health professionals before the shooting. Police were first alerted to Holmes' behavior six weeks before the shootings when he made unspecified threats to a professor six weeks before the shootings-- around the time he failed his year-end final exam. Prosecutor Karen Pearson did not elaborate on the nature of the threats.","James Holmes tried to awkwardly flirt with a University of Colorado classmate via text message .

Rashad Lewis, 26, was rotting in jail while his $150,000 Mercedes was flying around New York City, running red lights and raking up tickets - and he wants to know how it happened. Lewis claims that an NYPD officer took his wheels for a joy ride instead of straight to the impound lot, causing damage to the car's windows and he wants them to pay the price. The NYPD, however, says there was no foul play - they were simply driving the car to a more secure impound lot across town for the safety of the vehicle. Ride: Rashad Lewis, 26, was rotting in jail while his $150,000 Mercedes was flying around New York City, running red lights and raking up tickets - and he wants to know how it happened . 'My back window was broken, my driver’s-side door was keyed, and my bumper was scratched up,' the Queens college student said to the New York Post. 'They were driving my car with the windows down and having a ball joy riding my vehicle.' Lewis was arrested with a friend, Gregg Humpherys, 22, while the two were driving past Bloomingdales on August 3. Police stopped Lewis after he allegedly blew through two red lights. They collared him after they found several forged credit cards in his possession, stashed in the center console and scattered across the floor of the car, according to the complaint against him. Both men were arrested and charged with 13 counts of possession of a forged instrument. He was released after he posted $3,500 bail. 'My car was seized,' Lewis said. 'I went through the whole process. I was at the precinct for 12 or 13 hours. I posted bail and was released the next week.' A week or so later, he received a shock in the mail: a traffic ticket, complete with a photograph of his car blazing through a red light while he was in jail. Defense: The NYPD says there was no foul play - they were simply driving the car to a more secure impound lot across town for the safety of the vehicle. Lewis's vehicle running a red light is pictured at left and Lewis at right . 'My first reaction was, ""Are you guys serious?"" I had a whole bunch of emotions running through my mind,' he told the Post. 'I felt violated. I don’t know if they could have committed a crime in my vehicle.' He wants to know who the alleged joy rider was and what happened to his car. 'We'd like to see is who is driving the car, how they got the car, where they were going with the car and whether the police department condones this action,' Lewis's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, told the Mail Online. He said his client will absolutely fight the ticket and possibly seek compensation from the NYPD for the alleged damages to the car. But Paul Browne, the NYPD's spokesperson, said that Lewis didn't have a problem with the condition of his vehicle when he picked it up from the Springfield Gardens Auto Pound in Queens. 'There was no joy ride, and the driver's claims of damage came after the fact,' Mr Browne told the MailOnline. Jail: Lewis claims that an NYPD officer or employee took his wheels for a joy ride while he was in the Manhattan Detention Complex, pictured, speeding across the city's streets and he wants them to pay the price . Arrested: Lewis was arrested with a friend, Gregg Humpherys, 22, while the two were driving past Bloomingdales at the intersection of Lexington Ave and 59th Street, pictured, on August 3 . He said the car was vouchered in the 19th precinct and taken to a secure lot in the 26 precinct in Harlem due to the value of the automobile. The next day, it was driven to the Springfield Gardens, Queens pound, as per the police's normal practice. 'While enroute, the auto received a red light camera summons,' Mr Browne said. 'Officers used the West Side Hwy to the Battery Tunnel heading to the pound.' The ticket was received on 12th avenue going downtown near 34th Street, which seems to match the official statement. Furthermore, the NYPD plans to drop the ticket, though they have declined to reveal the identity of the driver.

The District Attorney has not dropped Lewis's charges on fraud. He's due in court on October 18. Lewis says he's so shaken by the incident, he doesn't even want to drive his car. 'I just want to get rid of my vehicle,' he said. 'I’m scared to drive around in that car. I don’t know if they put a bug or something in it.' Sargeant Lai, who has been working at the impound lot for the past five years said he's never heard of an incident anything like this. 'I know there's some sort of investigation going on right now,' he told the MailOnline. He did not specify if the person who was driving the vehicle might face punishment, though Mr Browne insists there was 'no wrong doing'. Mr Kornberg said that dropping the ticket isn't good enough.

He admitted that his collection was not completely representative of the population of Amsterdam, where the project was filmed, as representatives of some minorities were more reluctant to appear on camera than others. Mr Wolf said: 'In October 2011 I started documenting people in the city of Amsterdam, approaching them in the street and asking them to say their age in front of the camera. 'My aim was to ""collect"" a group of 100 people, from age 0 to 100. A one-year-old child . A two-year-old boy . A girl aged three . A 13-year-old boy . A girl aged 14 .

'I found my very old ""models"" in care homes and it was a privilege to document these - often vulnerable - people for this project. 'I had particular problems finding a 99 year-old.

Tulane's Devon Walker (18) and Julius Warmsley (92) tackle Tulsa's Kenny Welcome during the play in which Walker was seriously hurt . He is said to be in a stable condition, recovering in an intensive care unit but doctors are as of yet unsure what the outcome will be. 'These kind of injuries take 24, 48, sometimes 72 hours to fully declare themselves,' Dr. Greg Stewart, Tulane's director of sports medicine said before the surgery. 'We don't know what the long-term implications and outcomes are going to be.' Walker's injury occurred on the final play of the first half, hours after Tulane opened the Conference USA portion of its schedule against Tulsa.

A school worker has been jailed for 10 years for abusing two young girls and downloading more than 12,000 vile pornographic images after being shopped to police by his horrified wife. IT assistant Frederick Brookes, 62, plied his innocent victims - both under the age of 10 - with sweets and biscuits before indulging his sick fantasies. Brookes helped teach hundreds of children at a school in the New Forest, Hants. He even groomed a third girl to help him take video footage of one of the distressed victims, who was tied up and naked. 'A parent's worst nightmare': IT assistant Frederick Brookes, 62, was . shopped to police by his own wife after she became suspicious about him giving . girls treats . He was eventually shopped to the police after his wife became suspicious about him giving the girls treats. Judge Gary Burrell QC, who had to view the disturbing pictures at Southampton Crown Court, said they were some of the worst he had seen during his 30-year legal career. Passing sentence, Judge Burrell said: 'What you did to those girls was truly abhorrent. 'You breached the trust of their parents and your abuse has left their families quite distraught and you have damaged those children as well. 'You are in my opinion a parent’s worst nightmare. 'It is clear from the parents you were someone they trusted, as well they might because you were a pillar of the community.' One of Brookes’ victims suffers nightmares following her ordeal, and remains terrified that he will come and get her. Her parents say they feel totally betrayed by Brookes’ actions and feel they can no longer trust anyone. The . second girl’s parents said their once outgoing and confident daughter . was now too scared to sleep on her own and had become withdrawn. Prosecutor James Newton-Price told the court that Brookes had met his wife in 2001 when teaching in India and she was a student. They married and moved to the United Kingdom, but she became concerned when he began giving the youngsters so many sweets and biscuits. Last year, she asked one girl if he had done anything to her. Initially the young girl said ‘no’ but later went on to reveal that he had. Brookes denied it, but the next day Mrs Brookes spoke to the girls’ parents and the police were called. When questioned, Brookes admitted he had played with the children but denied touching them. Asked if detectives would find any sexual images on his computer, Brookes replied: 'Oh, God, no'. All his sickening images had been deleted or encrypted, but police officers managed to recover them. Images: Southampton Crown Court heard that the pictures were some of the worst the judge had seen during his 30-year legal career . Five moving images had been broken down frame-by-frame to show 196 still images of one of the girls he had filmed tied up. The school worker had also downloaded more than 12,000 other pornographic images of children. Nearly 1,000 were at the most serious level and featured sadism. In police interview, Brookes, of New Milton, said he felt embarrassed and disgusted with himself and needed help. He admitted six counts of sexual assault and 18 charges of making indecent images. None of his victims attended the school where he worked. Judge Burrell also banned Brookes from accessing children and the internet, placed him on the sex offenders’ register and disqualified him from working with children - all for life. In mitigation, Rebecca Austin said Brookes, of previous good character, had shown regret and remorse. She said: 'He has lost everything: his wife, his job, his home. 'He has also lost his good reputation and he has no friends. He has been suffering from depression and taking medication for it. 'He was not doing it for financial gain and has not shared the images with anyone.'","Frederick Brookes, 62, plied .

Dr Richard Keller, 56, of Andover, 'knowingly received films depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct' A pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital was arrested today after police found almost 100 child pornography DVDs and more than 500 similar images at his home. Dr Richard Keller, 56, of Andover, Massachusetts, 'knowingly received films depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct', according to the U.S. attorney's office. Keller was the medical director at Phillips Academy for almost 20 years before leaving in 2011. Phillips Academy is a highly prestigious boarding school for students in grades nine to 12 and the oldest incorporated academy in the United States, established in 1778 by Samuel Phillips, Jr. Andover has educated two American presidents, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Keller is also a pediatrics instructor at Harvard Medical School. In a statement released this afternoon, federal prosecutors said Keller 'purchased and ordered over 50 DVDs of child pornography online. 'At this time, more than 500 photographs and between 60 – 100 DVDs have been recovered during an ongoing search of Dr Keller’s home today.' The case began with an investigation of an oversea's movie production company that offered films featuring naked young boys having food fights, wrestling, showering together and playing Twister. When investigators accessed the company website and reviewed film previews and summaries, one of the videos was described as: 'We bring you action-packed discs of ooey-gooey slippery goodness. This two set disc features (name) and his buddies going commando in a very unique way. 'They're sweet enough but that didn't stop them from breaking out sugary cupcakes and giving you a whole new perspective on nudist food fighting.' An investigation into the pediatric endocrinologist's account showed that between January 2009 and July 2011, he ordered titles on 19 separate occasions, spending $2,695. On five of the 19 occasions, the pornographic material was sent to Phillips Academy's student health center, according to the arrest warrant. Concerns: Keller was placed on immediate leave from Boston Children's Hospital Boston pending an investigation . Famous boarding school: Keller worked at prestigious Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for almost 20 years before he left last year . It also states that 60 to 100 DVDs and 500 high-gloss images were seized from his bedroom.

'When the hospital learned of the allegations against Dr Richard Keller earlier today, he was immediately put on administrative leave pending results of the investigation by the US Attorney’s Office. We will cooperate fully with the US Attorney’s Office and all other involved regulatory and legal authorities. 'No complaints or concerns have been expressed by any patients or family members about the care Dr Keller provided while he was at Children's.'

A jury on Monday awarded casino mogul Steve Wynn $20million in his slander case against 'Girls Gone Wild' founder Joe Francis, who claimed the creator of some of Las Vegas' most upscale resorts threatened to kill him over a gambling debt. Witnesses disputed Francis' claims during a four-day trial, including Grammy winning record producer Quincy Jones, who Francis said told him about Wynn's threats and showed him a stack of emails that contained them. Wynn vehemently denied that. Save the drama: Joe Francis, . left, accused casino tycoon Steve Wynn, right, of hatching a plot to murder Francis and 'bury him in the desert' In siding with Wynn, the jury . determined that there was clear and convincing evidence that Francis . slandered the casino mogul and knew his allegations were false when he . made them. Francis had claimed Wynn threatened to hit him over the head . with a shovel and have him buried in the desert. Neither Wynn nor Francis was present in court Monday morning when the verdict was read. Wynn's attorney on Friday had asked . the panel to award the billionaire $12million plus punitive damages to . send a message that false statements that travel far in the Internet age . will not be tolerated. A second phase of the trial to decide punitive . damages will begin on Tuesday. Wynn's attorney, Barry Langberg, said after the verdict was read that the jury clearly saw the harm in Francis' remarks. 'The evidence was clear that there was falsity and there was damage,' Langberg said. Francis said he expects the verdict to be overturned on appeal due to judicial error. Swearing in: Music mogul Quincy Jones testified in court last week during the slander trial against Steve Wynn and the creator of Girls Gone Wild . 'I'm startled by the jury's verdict . because it's totally unfounded and the evidence does not support it,' Francis said in a phone interview. He said the judge erred by allowing . Wynn's attorneys to allow jurors to consider a new claim of slander . based on an interview Francis did with 'Good Morning America' after the . trial started. The panel awarded Wynn $11million in damages on that . claim alone. 'California law is very clear. You . can't add a cause of action at the end of trial about something that had . nothing to do with the trial,' Francis said. 'Therefore we are 100 . percent confident this jury verdict will be reversed on appeal.' The CEO of Wynn resorts and designer . of signature Las Vegas casinos such as The Mirage, Bellagio, Wynn and . Encore attended the trial. Suit up: Casino mogul Steve Wynn is pictured with his wife, Andrea, as the two arrived in the Los Angeles courthouse last week . Wynn said after arguments concluded on Friday . that he would donate any winnings, minus his attorney's fees, to . charities. Francis, who testified, has built a . business empire based on videos of young women flashing their breasts . for video cameras. His attorney argued that both men may be telling the . truth and that Francis may have been misled by Jones. Francis claims he . heard about the threats from the Grammy-winner, who is his neighbour, but . Jones denies hearing Wynn utter any threats. Langberg accused Francis of lying . about the threats, pointing out that there was no evidence of any email . Wynn had sent and multiple witnesses corroborating the casino mogul's . story. He argued that Francis was malicious because he repeated the . threats in the 'Good Morning America' interview. Francis had previously said at a court . hearing that Wynn threatened him over a $2million gambling debt . Francis incurred at Wynn's hotel.

'I was afraid for my life and I only made . that statement when I was ordered by a judge to do so.'

Among other mishaps, the thieves got trapped in the store and the BMW’s license plate fell off and was left at the crime scene. Scroll down for video . Charged: Alleged leader of the robbery, 22-year-old Equonne Howard, pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. Howard allegedly used his own BMW X5 to crash into the Apple store last Thursday . Smash and grab: Surveillance footage shows the BMW crashing into the Californian Apple store around 5am on September 6 . The alleged leader of the gang, 22-year-old Equonne Howard, used his own 2003 BMW X5 to crash through the storefront’s glass and metal security gate around 5am last Thursday, police said. Surveillance footage from inside the store shows a masked thief leap out of the car and sweep up as many iPods and iPads as he can. Of course, Apple’s long-awaited iPhone 5 was not available to be swiped as it had not been released on the day the robbers struck. The gang’s mine sweep was cut short after the store’s security gate dropped back down, trapping them and the BMW inside. Shocking surveillance video shows the BMW repeatedly drive further into the store – smashing into tables of merchandise – then reverse back into the gate to ram through it. Frantic: A masked man is seen in front of the car grabbing Apple products . Disastrous: The BMW repeatedly drove forwards into the shop to get speed up to ram against the security gate which had dropped down . The getaway was made all the harder as the car already had two flat tires from the initial break in. After eventually escaping the Apple store, Howard allegedly stopped at a 7-Eleven where police say he stole some Fix-a-Flat, a product to mend flat tires. Later that day, Howard returned to the Apple store to try and fetch his car’s license plate which had fallen off mid-robbery. Police were waiting for Howard, who is already on parole for a previous robbery, and promptly arrested him. Howard had the BMW car keys in his pocket when he was arrested. Howard pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges of vandalism, burglary, and theft of electronics. He is being held on  $600,000 bond, which authorities said was the estimated damage to the Apple store, which was still boarded up this week.

A fraudster who tried to smuggle drugs into prison for her convict boyfriend has joined him behind bars after police caught her with £700 worth of heroin stuffed inside her bra. Officers found the Class A drug in Stacey Martin's underwear after they stopped her car in Wolverhampton on April 7 last year. Detectives believe the heroin had been destined for Martin's partner Andrew Warley, as they had managed to foil a similar plot devised by the pair only two days earlier. Caught: Stacey Martin (left) had £700 worth of heroin stuffed inside her bra when police stopped her car in Wolverhampton. Detectives believe the drugs had been destined for her boyfriend Andrew Warley (right) Martin, 32, had hidden a £360 wrap of skunk cannabis in a packet of crisps in bushes outside Ranby Prison in Nottinghamshire. The plan was that a fellow inmate on litter-picking duty would collect the packet and smuggle it inside for Warley, who was serving time for dangerous driving. But police got their first and replaced the packet with another containing fake drugs. Martin, of Penn, Wolverhampton, was jailed for two years when she appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday. She admitted two counts of conspiracy to supply drugs, as well as a conspiracy to commit fraud after police found she had staged a carjacking in an attempt to claim cash on her insurance. Warley was jailed for four and a half years after he admitted the same three charges and a further count of perverting the course of justice. The court heard that the first offence was the carjacking plot, which happened on March 26 last year. Witnesses reported seeing Martin pulling into a petrol station in Wolverhampton in a BMW convertible worth almost £40,000, only for two men to rush at her, snatch the keys and drive away. The insurance company did not pay out, and police uncovered the plot when it became clear that Martin had put down a £25,405 cash deposit for the car when she had no obvious income. The crisp packet conspiracy happened on April 5 last year, when Martin was seen pulling into a car park outside Ranby Prison. Conspiracy: Martin and Warley hatched a plan for skunk cannabis to be smuggled into Ranby Prison (pictured) in a crisp packet, but police foiled the scheme . A male associate was then seen to place the crisp packet beneath a tree. The next morning, detectives watched in secret as an inmate on litter-picking duty headed straight to the tree, scooped up the crisp packet and placed it in a bin bag. Ignoring other rubbish on the floor, he went straight back to the prison gate but was arrested at the entrance. Martin was driving the Fiesta again two days later when she was stopped by police. Officers searched the car, but only found the drugs when they arrived at a police station and Martin admitted: 'I've got it in my bra - half of brown.' Detective Constable Lee Price, of West Midlands Police’s Organised Crime Unit, said: 'The pair were clearly planning ways of getting drugs inside prison and also hatching plans to make almost £40,000 by staging a robbery of Martin's BMW convertible. 'Detectives became aware of their scheme, though, and both are now paying the penalty. 'Police, prison and the courts view criminality behind bars very seriously and anyone caught trying to convey drugs, phones or other contraband into jail faces a jail term of up to 10 years.'","Police found the drugs in Stacey Martin's underwear when they stopped her car in Wolverhampton .

Matt Lauer, pictured yesterday on the Today show, is said to be an 'anchor animal' by NBC sources . The Today show has been floundering in ratings, and sources say they know why. Insider NBC sources told the New York Post’s Page Six that Matt Lauer, who has been co-anchor of the morning show since 1997, has become an ‘anchor animal.’ They said that he’s even gone so far as to forbid the name of opposing Good Morning America from being mentioned. Sources told Page Six that Lauer is now ‘running the show and he’s not listening to anyone,’ causing a ‘huge problem.’ Viewership has been slipping away from the Today show as rival GMA has been gaining ground, winning the ratings war for the past two weeks. Early data shows that the ABC News morning show will most likely win for a third week, as well. Another source lamented that the staff is overworked in an effort to catch up to GMA’s ratings. ‘Matt’s telling the staff they don’t work hard enough, which is hard to take from a guy working four days a week, making millions,’ the source told Page Six. According to the gossip column, there are talks about Morning Joe co-host Willie Geist to join the flailing show, months after former co-host Ann Curry was let go. Scroll down for video .

Trade Off: She was replaced by Savannah Guthrie, 40, pictured, amid reports her relationship with anchor Matt Lauer had turned sour . Responding to Page Six’s request for . comment, Lauer said: ‘Please print this story – it’s the most . interesting and dangerous I’ve ever sounded!’ Battling the elements: Lauer braved the New York weather yesterday, carrying a large white umbrella . NBC News did not immediately return MailOnline's request for comment. Additionally, in the 10 weeks before . Curry quit, Today got 4.94 million viewers, but in the 10 weeks since . she left there were just 4.6million. The figures will be especially depressing for NBC as they include its coverage of the London Olympics. The . network had hoped the $2.3billion that it paid for the exclusive rights . to screen The Games would give it a huge ratings boost. Curry’s . departure from her ‘dream job’ after just year in the role was tearful . and on camera she told viewers that she had tried her best, even though . she apparently failed. She was replaced by Savannah Guthrie, 40, amid reports her relationship with anchor Matt Lauer had turned sour. Now however Curry has had her ‘revenge’ and the decision to fire her seems to have backfired. Today’s . bitter rival, ABC’s ‘Good Morning America’ is on set to win its third . consecutive week in a row, suggesting it could start to pull ahead soon. GMA took the No.1 spot from Today for the first time earlier this year, ending its 16-year run as the most-watched morning show. The viewing figures also show that there has been a shift away from Today among the key 25-54 audience. In the 10 weeks before Curry left it was 2.1million but in the 10 weeks after it was just 1.9million. Brad Adgate, Horizon Media’s senior vice president of research, told the New York Post: ‘The ratings point out the momentum GMA has been building.

Blame Game: Today’s bitter rival, ABC’s Good Morning America is on set to win its third consecutive week in a row, suggesting it could start to pull ahead soon . In talks? There have been discussions for Morning Joe's Willie Geist to join Today, according to Page Six . ‘Viewers like what they’re doing - it’s all so personality-driven, and that’s a recipe for success. ‘Even though NBC had the Olympics, ratings have fallen back to pre-Olympic levels.’ In an interview with Ladies’ Home Journal the 55-year-old claimed she was let go because of her bad dress sense. She also revealed that she did not like to wear high heels even though her bosses asked her to and that her gray hair became an issue. Curry said that at one point a colleague even compared her to Froot Loops mascot Toucan Sam because of her multicolored dress. The reason for the bitter rivalry between NBC and ABC is simple - money and prestige. In 2011 Today earned $500m from adverts, helped significantly by the fact it was no.1 in the ratings. GMA by contrast managed $310m. A 30-second advert on Today sells for $52,000 versus $35,000 for GMA, according to analysts Kantar Media.

Criminals can get hold of the weapons with relative ease as they are smuggled into the UK from countries such as Afghanistan, underworld sources say.

The weapons were all brought in through Manchester Airport, and a number have been linked to shootings in Greater Manchester and Merseyside. Greenoe was jailed for 10 years. Tuesday's killings have shocked police officers, many of whom are unaccustomed to grenade attacks in Britain. Pictured: Dale Cregan is being questioned in connection with the killings of the police officers . David Anthony, a former chief superintendent at Greater Manchester Police, told Sky News: 'I have never in 31 years' police service come across a criminal incident where hand grenades are used?' He said police would be trying to trace the origin of the grenade, whether it had come from the Army, had been imported from abroad or was possibly home-made. The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, dismissed suggestions that grenades were ‘common currency’. He said: 'Clearly, part of the unusual nature of this case is that we have not, to my knowledge, recovered hand grenades before and hand grenades have not been used in this way. 'It certainly doesn’t indicate that they are common currency. However, there’s always concern that various sorts of weapons can come in from other parts of the world.' Attacks involving grenades are rare. One was left on the wall of former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish’s home in Southport in July 2009.

The 34-year-old attached a special lens to his camera along with a custom-made water housing to protect it from the surf, before handing the equipment to a professional bodyboarder to shoot pictures - even as the waves were poised to crash over his head. Surf's up: Photographer Lee Kelly handed his equipment to bodyboarder Glen Thurston (pictured) who took this shot from within the crest of a wave in Tahiti . Mr Kelly, who grew up near legendary surfing hotspot Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, said: 'I work hard taking photos like this, but when they come off, it really is a bit of a fluke.

'He could frame it badly by accident as he has no idea where the camera is pointing,' the photographer explained. 'He could wipe out and have the camera ripped out of his hand, or smash onto the coral reef and flood my camera. So much can go wrong, so when you nail a good one it's quite exciting.

A Bank of America worker whose right hand, arm and leg were disabled in a car accident is suing the bank after they allegedly fired him for his typing and walking too slowly. Daniel Hermann, 38, was left without the full use of his right limbs after he was severely injured in the crash in 1992, but the bank said accommodating him 'wouldn't be fair to people with two hands'. Hermann, from Irwin, Pennsylvania, claims he was fired on September 20, 2010 for being a couple of minutes late from his lunch break as it took him longer to walk from the lunch room due to his limp. In a lawsuit, he also said the bank repeatedly ignored his pleas for breaks and equipment to accommodate his disabilities and told him they didn't follow rules set out in the Disabilities Act. 'Discrimination': Daniel Hermann, pictured with his wife and children, is suing Bank of America after they allegedly fired him for walking and typing too slowly due to his disabilities . 'We've filed this lawsuit because Bank . of America's conduct was unacceptable and the company should be held . accountable when its supervisors and managers violate the law,' his attorney, Emily Town, told ABC News. Hermann had worked in the customer service department for Merill Lynch, helping mortgagors behind on their payments,  for three years before it was acquired by the Bank of America in January 2010. Prior to the acquisition, he had 'thrived' in the work place as Merill Lynch accommodated his disabilities, including allowing him to take break between calls to type up notes with his left hand, and providing him with a left-handed keyboard, the lawsuit says. These conditions allowed Hermann, who had a total of 13 years in the banking industry, to regularly earn a monthly bonus if he spoke to five mortgagors every hour. But when his job was transferred to Bank of America's customer service department, the support vanished, the lawsuit claims. Fired: He claims supervisors ignored his requests for equipment he had previously been allowed and told him that accommodating him 'wouldn't be fair to people with two hands' Hurt: Hermann, pictured with his wife Betsy, is unable to fully use his right hand, arm or leg after a car accident . The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability, which is defined as 'a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity'. The protective law is flexible but it can only be strengthened, not weakened, in the future. In terms of employment, it prohibits an employer discriminating against a qualified worker with a disability. It covers job application procedures, promotions, advancement and training. It also demands that reasonable accommodations are made for disabled employees with physical or mental limitations. As well as the workplace, the law extends to public transport, accommodation, public facilities and communications for people who are blind or deaf.

It is the kind of civilised al-fresco dining you’d normally associate with an upmarket French cafe. But these BT Openreach workers in Savile Row defied expectations when, instead of eating a standard lunch of sandwiches with a cup of tea, they sat down to enjoy a hot meal and glass of red wine. Every day Matt Bevan, 49, and Bob Lazarus, 58, who have worked together for the past eight years, will cook lunch from scratch using the little gas cooker in the back of their van. Tucking in: Matt Bevan, centre, along with colleagues Brian and Bob, enjoy a freshly-cooked meal on their lunchbreak during another BT job in London's Savile Row . Eating properly: The trio shun sandwiches and mugs of tea in favour of a sit down meal and a glass of red . This week they have been unfurling their gingham table cloths and laying out their plates, metal cutlery and wine glasses to enjoy what they describe as a ‘civilised lunch’ at Savile Row in Mayfair - famous for its posh tailors and bespoke suits. The pair have a selection of herbs and spices at the ready and stop off at the market on the way to work to pick up fresh ingredients – rustling up anything from Italian pasta dishes to fish with vegetables. And the sophistication doesn’t end there. Mr Bevan, who has a fondness for anything retro and enjoys dancing, insists on playing 1920s music, jazz and classical throughout the day to create a ‘pleasant ambience’ and has decorated the van with quirky artefacts. Dining in style: The three men have worked together for years and take it in turns to try out culinary creations on each other during their breaks . Making a meal of things: The trio like to eat in different places and enjoy 'putting a smile on people's faces'. Meat the chef: Bob Lazarus prepares mince for his spaghetti bolognese . Mr Bevan, who works at different venues across London with Mr Lazarus in their job as BT engineers, said: ‘We spend most of our nine-hour day working underground so it makes us feel a bit more human to clean ourselves up before our lunch break and enjoy a proper meal. ‘After all it’s cheaper and fresher and we go back to the job with a clearer head. It’s just how we cook at home. My signature dish is chorizo pesto pasta with rocket salad and parmesan shavings.’ He added: ‘We both have an appreciation for the finer things in life. And passers-by always enjoy it too.’ This week's menu has included Thai green curry, washed down with red wine, and spaghetti bolognese with a baguette.

Thousands of protesters descended on the U.S. embassy in Pakistan today over an anti-Islam video causing police to fire live rounds and tear gas into the crowds, injuring 50 people. An estimated 5,000 demonstrators carrying the flags of hardline Islamist groups pelted police with stones as security forces tried to prevent them from reaching the embassy compound in Islamabad. The military were forced to intervene due to the size of the crowd, many of them students, and helicopters hovered overheard. Several policemen were injured in the clashes. Violence: A protester pelts police with stones as they released tear gas and live rounds outside the U.S. embassy in Islamabad where a crowd of 5,000 people gathered over the anti-Islam film today . Anger: Much of the outrage across the Islamic world has been directed at the U.S. government who have moved to distance themselves from the film . 'It is our responsibility to protect all our diplomats, all the foreigners,' said Pakistani Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira. He criticized protesters for resorting to violence and suggested that various religious and militant groups among the crowd were to blame. U.S. Embassy advertisements condemning the anti-Islam video appeared on Pakistani television on Thursday in an attempt to undercut anger against the United States, where the film was produced. The movie portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a fraud, a womanizer and a child molester and has fueled outrage across the Islamic world. Protesters have directed their anger at . the U.S. government, insisting it should do something to stop it, . although the film was privately produced. American officials have criticized it for intentionally offending Muslims. Student Jawad Ahmed told Al Jazeera: 'Our policemen are not any better than the . Americans because they are trying to stop us. They are in the same . league as them, they are heretics like them. Raging: Smoke rises from tear gas shells fired by police to disperse protesters as they attempt to reach the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad . Struggle: Police fired live round and tear gas into the crowd as they battled to keep demonstrators from reaching the grounds of the U.S. embassy . 'They should allow us to demolish the American embassy because they have blasphemed against our holy Prophet. The police are also becoming an accomplice of blasphemers.' Demonstrations raged across Pakistan in Lahore and in the Kashmir capital of Muzaffarabad where hundreds of people set fire to an effigy of President Obama. Protests in Pakistan are expected to grow on Friday, the Islamic day of prayer which the government has also declared a day of national holiday.

In recent days, the decision by a French satirical magazine to release cartoons crudely depicting the prophet has added to the tension, as may the upcoming issue of the German satirical magazine Titanic.

A lifelong train enthusiast sent poison pen letters and a threat to bomb an historic railway and harm passengers, in a bizarre bid to blacken the name of his cancer-stricken friend's son. Scheming Nicholas Cawthorne, 50, wrote poison pen letters and threatened to bomb North Yorkshire Moors Railway and harm passengers to blacken the name of the son of his best friend Dennis Lake, who was dying of cancer. Leeds Magistrates Court heard Cawthorne, of Colton, Leeds, who had a 'life-long love' of railways, signed the letters 'David Lake' as part of an harassment campaign to tarnish the railway volunteer's reputation. Campaign: Cawthorne sent letters threatening to bomb the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, but signed them with a volunteer's name . Freelance photographer Cawthorne began his campaign of hate against volunteer train engineer Mr Lake in February this year shortly before his father Dennis died of gastric cancer at the age of 75. Mr Lake was arrested on two occasions and even former gardener Dennis, who was in the last stages of his life, was taken into custody on suspicion of penning the threatening letters. Prosecutor Marie Austin-Walsh said some of the letters, which were sent in February and March this year, were directed against management. She told the court: 'Some of them are threatening and abusive, some of them make threats to harm passengers and one refers to a bomb being placed on the railway. 'None of them were taken seriously by the railway or the police to the degree of any immediate action being taken. 'The police seem to have formed the opinion that, in their words, the letters were written by some sort of crank.' Mr Lake was arrested as a result of the letters, but denied ever writing them and was released on bail. Caught: Cawthorne was unveiled after police matched his fingerprints and DNA to letters he sent in his own name . He was re-arrested after Cawthorne sent more letters in his name, but the real writer was unmasked after he sent correspondence to the company in his own name complaining about Mr Lake. Ms Austin-Walsh said: 'In his letters he describes concerns about Mr Lake, saying he shouldn't be working there and they should get rid of him. 'He said Mr Lake was insulting people there. These were all false allegations.' After the hearing Mr Lake said he remained baffled as to why Cawthorne carried out the campaign. He said: 'He knew how hard I was finding it looking after my father full time and he made the decision to make my life so much harder.' Mr Lake said the pair would meet up a couple of time a week for drinks. He said: 'When the police turned up at the house for the first time in February it nearly finished my father off. 'I've no idea why Nicholas would do such a thing - particularly giving that he knew my father's condition. 'They used to work together on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway and had been good friends for a lot of years. - DAVID LAKE . 'I knew Nicholas through my work as an engineer on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. 'He was a real enthusiast and used to come to take pictures. 'I didn't know him well enough for him to have a vendetta against me though. 'I've been arrested twice and had to suffer the indignation of being put on bail. 'What have I done to this man to make him want to treat me like this? 'The whole thing nearly finished my father off as he had a lot of health problems along with his cancer. 'It was only rarely that the two of us spoke but clearly he had some problems with me. 'I'm just glad my father didn't live to find out that it was his close friend who was responsible for all the anguish the pair of us had to go through in the months leading up to his death.' Anguish: Mr Lake said he remained 'baffled' as to why Cawthorne carried out the campaign at a time when his father was dying . Cawthorne was arrested after police matched his fingerprints and DNA to the earlier threatening letters - while a handwriting expert said the letters must have been written by the same person. In mitigation Ghazanfar Iqbal said his client had never been in trouble before and was deeply embarrassed. He said Cawthorne, who pleaded guilty to harassment, lived with his parents and suffered a breakdown at the time. He said: 'He understands the impact this has had on Mr Lake and wants to apologise to him. 'This is a lifelong love of his and something he realises he won't be able to return to.' Cawthorne was handed an indefinite restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Lake or North Yorkshire Moors Railway staff, or travelling on the railway. He was also given a four month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, 100 hours of unpaid work and was ordered to pay Mr Lake £500 in compensation along with £85 court costs. After the hearing a North Yorkshire Moors Railway spokesman said: 'It was a distressing time for the volunteers and staff working at NYMR, but we are pleased that the authorities are dealing with this matter.'","Nicholas Cawthorne sent a letter threatening to bomb historic railway signed as David Lake .

The potentially deadly exotic caterpillars invading Britain are unstoppable, an expert warned yesterday. Oak processionary moths, which are highly toxic pests during their caterpillar stage, have spread into new areas of the country. There are even fears the insects could affect the Olympics if oak trees in East London suffer an infestation. Fears: The oak processionary moth caterpillar is highly toxic and have spread into new areas of the country . If this happens, millions of spectators could come into contact with poisonous hairs on the caterpillars that contain powerful toxins. Each caterpillar is covered in 63,000 of these hairs, which can trigger potentially lethal asthma attacks. The bristles can blow off in the wind and cause painful skin and throat rashes, running eyes, vomiting, dizziness and fever if you come into contact with them. Spreading: The oak processionary moth loses its toxicity once it has turned into a moth as seen here . Tony Kirkham, head of the arboretum at Kew Gardens, said the pest was resilient to bad weather and difficult to eradicate. ‘We use spray to keep them at bay but even the nest removals at Kew don’t totally control oak processionary moths,’ he said. ‘You can slow them down but we will never find them all. They will always keep increasing.’ The creatures can usually be spotted in oak trees, where they strip off the leaves before turning into moths. Swarm: The oak processionary moth caterpillars have been found on trees at Kew Gardens in south west London . They first appeared in Britain in 2006, after they were brought into London on a batch of oak trees imported from Holland. Since then they have spread rapidly across the South East and have been spotted as far afield as Reading and Sheffield. It is feared that the pest will be prevalent throughout the South East within five years. In Belgium, the situation became so bad that the army was sent in to incinerate the caterpillars’ nests – but officials here have no such plans.","Each caterpillar is covered in 63,000 hairs which can trigger potentially lethal asthma attacks .

Flying over the skies of Chengdu in southwest China, the Chinese's latest stealth plane - the J-20 Might Dragon - is a testament to China's growing prowess in military technology. The debut flight of the plane may serve as a warning to the U.S. air force, which has been plagued by a list of problems in their jets - including the revelation that some of their jets have a faulty oxygen system which have slowly been poisoning their pilots. Sightings of the black plane taking off have again led to claims that the plane was developed off the back of stolen U.S. or Russian plans, a claim strongly denied by China. The Chinese J-20 stealth fighters take too the air for test runs: The planes mark China's entry as the third nation to have stealth technology vehind the U.S. and Russia . See anything familiar? The F-22 Raptor has similar canted tail-fins, a similar bubble canopy and nose section, and both have no flat surfaces to help avoid radar detection . Wired claims that the current batch of U.S. fighter jets are struggling due to labour disputes, cost over-runs, and lethal design flaws. First off, the U.S.'s Lockheed’s F-22 Raptor - the latest stealth fighter which cost $66.7 billion to develop - have been poisoning its pilots owing to a faulty oxygen system. Meanwhile, workers at Lockheed’s F-35 factory have gone on strike, with no end in sight. The F-35 has also been delayed by several years due to design costs - and the delay means that the cost of building thousands of new jets has risen by hundreds of billions of dollars. China originally claimed the J-20 would not be ready until 2017 at the earliest, and the U.S, countered and said it would likely be 2020 or later. However, the test flight shows how close to completion the first models are, and Wired points out that China eschews the U.S. system of carefully testing new jets over a decade. Instead, China holds preliminary tests and then passes the jets over to the military, and reply on feedback to improve the next generation. The U.S. tried to emulate this model with the F-35 - but encountered design flaws which ended up costing the military billions of dollars. Wired said the Chinese were using imported Russian engines to power the the J-20, and said this could lead to future issues and delays in rolling out the stealth jets. And Russia makes three: The MiG jet was built to rival the U.S. stealth programme . Last year China was caught in an international row after the U.S. charged and jailed Indian-American Noshir Gowadia, a former B-2 stealth bomber engineer, for leaking secrets to China. He was jailed for 32 years. And when the J-20 was unveiled, other nations - incredulous how quickly the Chinese has developed and tested the stealth fighter aircraft - said the technology must have been stolen. One of the more extraordinary claims was that it had gained invaluable information from parts of an American F-117 Nighthawk stealth bomber that had been shot down over Serbia during the Kosovo War – the only F-117 ever shot down. The Chinese insist that the country's J-20 stealth fighter jet was the work of the country's own designers and engineers. An unnamed official was quoted as saying: 'It's not the first time foreign media has smeared newly unveiled Chinese military technologies. It's meaningless to respond to such a speculation.' Chinese pilot Xu Yongling said that the J-20 possesses an advanced supersonic cruise ability and powerful air mobility that are technological breakthroughs for the country. He added it would have been impossible for China to glean technology from the F-117 as the 'outdated' technology was behind the current generation of fighters.","China's first stealth plane spotted on test runs, making China one of three nations with stealth jet technology .

Increasing numbers of patients are being banned from seeing their GP just for making a complaint . Increasing numbers of patients are being banned from seeing their GP just for making a complaint, campaigners warn. They risk being unfairly struck off their surgery’s list for reporting that their doctor has been rude or the practice has refused to offer them an appointment. Some family doctors are even forcing patients to undertake a phone interview before booking an appointment to ensure they are ill enough to be seen. The Patients Association said there has been a surge in the volume of calls to its helpline concerning ‘dismissive’ or ‘disrespectful’ GPs. The charity – which mainly deals with patients who have suffered poor hospital care – says the proportion of calls made to its helpline about GPs has doubled in just two years. Members of the public are increasingly reporting being unfairly struck off a surgery’s list and refused any future appointments, it says. Its survey of 500 patients found nearly one in 20 had been removed at some point after having made a complaint. Under Department of Health guidelines, surgeries must have a valid reason for striking patients off and have to give at least one warning beforehand. Patients can be removed – or deregistered – if the practice deems there has been an ‘irrevocable breakdown’ in their relationship with their GP or staff. Unfairly refused: A Patients Association survey found that one in 20 patients had been removed at some point after having made a complaint about their GP . Last year the Health Service Ombudsman . warned entire families were being struck off over trivial disagreements . with doctors or even complaining that receptionists aren’t answering the . phone. One patient was removed after voicing concerns staff had lost . her medical records. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association says there should be tough sanctions for GPs and practices unfairly striking off patients . Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘There is a shockingly significant number removed from lists after making a complaint. ‘Even more worrying, there are many more patients who do not raise genuine concerns because they fear being taken off the list.’ She said there should be tough sanctions for doctors and practices found to be unfairly striking patients off. The helpline said that of the 8,000 calls it receives each year, the proportion concerning GPs doubled in the past 12 months. They now represent a quarter of all calls, up from 11 per cent last year. One patient said before he was allowed to book an appointment the doctor carried out a three-minute phone interview to establish whether the patient really needed to see him. Another contacted the charity because her GP was ‘rude’ and ‘dismissive’. She was afraid to report this in case she was struck off their list.","Increasing numbers of patients are being unfairly struck off their GP's list for reporting a complaint against their doctor .

He said he would give details of his new pledge later this autumn. But Tory MPs last night called for 'action, not words' and said any referendum must include an option to leave the EU if the Prime Minister was to restore his battered credibility on the issue.

Prime Minister David Cameron spoke out about a 'new settlement for Britain' on the day he walked around the poor Mare Favela north of Rio De Janeiro . In a further ramping up of the rhetoric on Europe Mr Cameron also confirmed for the first time that Britain will opt-out of a package of more than 100 EU justice and policing powers later this year - before deciding which ones to opt back in to. The decision sets up a bruising row with Nick Clegg over whether Britain should remain under the jurisdiction of the controversial EU arrest warrant. Mr Cameron has come under intense pressure from his own party to toughen his stance on Europe, amid signs that the euro crisis is accelerating the drive to create a federal Europe.European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso announced this month that he wants to turn the EU into a 'federation of nation states' by 2014. Yesterday Mr Cameron indicated that a new EU treaty would spark a referendum in the UK. But he suggested the poll would come after the 2015 election. And he again stressed his own view that Britain should stay in the EU - suggesting that any referendum may not include an option for Britain to leave.

Mobbed: The PM talks with youths during a visit to Luta pela Paz- which translates as Fight for Peace . Fun: The children seemed pleased to meet Britain's Prime Minister at the project . Speaking from Brazil, where he has been leading a trade mission, he said: 'I don't think it is in Britain's interests to leave the EU, but I do think what it is increasingly becoming the time for is a new settlement between Britain and Europe and I think that new settlement will require fresh consent. 'In the next Parliament, I think there will be opportunities for a fresh settlement and for new consent to that settlement. 'There is a reason why. The euro is a currency with 17 different countries. I think increasingly, one currency will mean one economic policy. They are going to change and that will give us opportunities for changing our relationship with Europe.

'I argue for Britain's membership because I think it is in our interests. If I didn't think it was in our interests, I wouldn't argue for British membership.' Eurosceptic MP Douglas Carswell said the Prime Minister had 'lost credibility' on the issue in the eyes of many voters. And he said it was critical that any referendum contained an option for people to leave the EU. Mr Carswell said: 'It is all very well for the Prime Minister to talk about what he may or may not do after the next election but unless we get on and give people a vote in an in/out referendum we will see many more Conservative voters desert us before the next election. Learning: On his tour of the area Mr Cameron met project director Luke Dowdney where there is no police control . Event: He then took part in a class at the project in one of Brazil's toughest neighbourhoods . 'It would be entirely bogus if he offers the British people a referendum that doesn't include an option to leave the EU. 'The Prime Minister has broken one cast-iron pledge on this and lacks credibility as a result. We need action now, not words.' Fellow Tory John Baron described Mr Cameron's comments as a 'step forward' but said it was disappointing that the Prime Minister was resisting calls to legislate now for a referendum after 2015. 'There are many upsides in committing to a referendum now – not least it would address the very real lack of public trust when people hear politicians making promises about the EU.' Mr Cameron confirmed that Britain will use an opt-out to pull out of a package of more than 100 EU policing and justice powers. but ministers will then seek to opt back into some felt to be in Britain's interests. He said:We’ll be exercising that opt-out.  They key thing then is, well, which of the array of things you’ve come out of do you actually think are good for Britain and you want to cooperate with European partners on?  And that’s a discussion we’re having at the moment.' The Lib Dems are pressing to keep Britain in the EU arrest warrant despite concerns it has led to the wrongful arrest of many British citizens.","Euro crisis will allow 'opportunities for a new settlement between Britain and Europe,' PM said .

A new Getcash app has been developed that will allow people to take out £100 a time from thousands of cash machines with a few taps of their smartphone. Royal Bank of Scotland has created the app which will be available to its 18 million customers who will be able to withdraw from any one of the 8,000 RBS, Natwest and Tesco stores, across the country. Revolutionary: Smartphone users will now be able to access their cash without wallets at the touch of a button . The new app works by allowing you to choose the amount you want to withdraw from a screen displayed on your phone. A six-digit code then appears on your phone’s screen which is valid for three hours and is tapped into an ATM to withdraw cash. At first you will only be able to take out just £100 a time but this will soon rise to match the amount you can withdraw with a debit card, typically £250. You can also text a code to a friend who can then withdraw the money. To use it you must have a smartphone or an iPhone or BlackBerry and download the GetCash app. But Simon Rose, spokesman for banking pressure group Save our Savers dismissed the app as a ‘gimmick’. He said: ‘What about the millions of customers who aren’t able to download this app? Will they end up being disenfranchised by their bank?’ ‘RBS might be trying to make banking look sexy but if the experience of the last couple of years is anything to go by, it would be better if they stayed dull and steady.’ RBS said GetCash would help revellers who want to avoid taking bulging bags or wallets out with them when they hit the tiles. It said it would also prove invaluable to workers who arrive at the office only to find they have left their purse or wallet at home. Royal Bank of Scotland has created the app which will be available to its 18 million customers who will be able to withdraw from any one of the 8,000 RBS, Natwest and Tesco stores, across the country. The app could also allow worried parents of cash-strapped students to send money directly to their children if their loans failed to arrive in their accounts. Ben Green, head of mobile at NatWest and RBS said: ‘This has never been done anywhere in the UK, and yet is a really simple and secure way to help our customers get cash whenever and wherever they need it.’ The bank says that by the end of July it expects customers will be able to leave their debit cards at home and use their phones to pay for items in shops - although it stresses there are no plans to phase out debit cards. Banks and phone companies are racing to launch mobile payment technology. In February Barclays launched its Pingit app which allows you to instantly send money with your mobile phone to others who sign up to the same service. And in April phone company O2 launched a similar service. But unlike the RBS and Barclays apps which are free it comes with a 15p per message fee after the first six months. However the technology has sparked fears could allow criminals to steal from users. A poll for insurer Insurance2go found more than half of Britons were worried mobile payments would put them at greater risk of fraud.","New app lets bank customers withdraw £100 a time from cash machines using their phones .

'Ascending Aggies': A team of student engineers from Utah State University have constructed their very own wall-crawler out of an adapted vacuum cleaner . Up, up and away: The device, which is worn like a backpack, can climb 90ft up any surface - including glass, brick or rock - without a rope . Led by Dr Steve Hansen, the 15-man . team was inspired by a U.S. Air Force request for the scientific . community to solve the problem of how a soldier can scale a high wall . without using a grappling hook. They have now been given $100,000 to continue development after impressing military chiefs with their prototype. The Ascending Aggies is powered by a . battery which lasts for half an hour, far longer than the length of time . anticipated for a soldier to hoist himself over a wall. But the most important element of the team's mission was to come up with technology that can grip to any vertical surface. They developed the Personal Vacuum . Assisted Climber (PVAC), which is made from two suction pads and bits . and bobs from a household vacuum cleaner. The pads, unsurprisingly, form an . airtight seal when pressed against a vertical surface which is . strengthened by the suction from the vacuum . The engineers have now been given $100,000 to continue development after impressing military chiefs with their prototype . Future improvements: The team wants to make the pack smaller, less heavy and less noisy . It can also be operated hands-free, allowing a soldier to wield a weapon or other device without falling to the ground. Dr Steve Hansen told Business . Insider: 'The beauty of this solution was that it is relatively surface . independent, allowing a soldier to use a weapon or other device while . hanging from the PVAC.' One major drawback is the noise the . Ascending Aggies currently makes, which totally destroys any chance of . achieving a surprise attack. But the Utah State team hopes to tackle this next. Dr Hansen said: 'This is not a major problem in a daytime urban environment, but is a problem in a nighttime stealth operation. 'In the next version, technology will . be used or developed to suppress, reduce, or cancel the noise of the . vacuums and the motors.' Other improvements the engineers want to implement are to make the pack smaller and less heavy.","Their 'Ascending Aggies' device, which is worn like a backpack, was developed by student engineers at Utah State University .

Tesco has come near the bottom of a poll to find out which supermarket offers the best shopping experience. The chain came eighth, only above budget stores Aldi and Lidl. Waitrose topped the list. The survey assessed how easy it was to get around the store, the range in each department and how helpful the staff were. Consumer experts rated Tesco in just eighth place out of the ten major supermarket chains, in a survey conduced by consumer website canieatit.co.uk . It also compared the prices, choice, quality and nutritional information of products from each store. It is another blow for the retailer in . what has been a bad year, suffering a disastrous trading period last . Christmas, followed by profit warnings, share price falls and a revamp . of its own brand range after poor sales. Only no frill specialists Aldi and Lidl are below them while all of Tesco's so-called 'Big Four' rivals do better in the latest study by consumer website canieatit.co.uk. Using its own research and feedback from thousands of users, the site  tested every aspect of the 'shopping experience' in each of the chains. Waitrose came top of the table of Britain's favourite supermarket, despite being pilloried recently for being too middle class . Asda came in seventh in the survey conducted by Canieatit.co.uk above Aldi, Lidl and Tesco . Top of the table is Waitrose which, despite being pilloried recently for being too middle class, has improved its overall range while making its own label products more competitively priced, said canieatit.co.uk . This means it competes better with upmarket rivals like M&S and mid-market competitors like Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - the 'Big Four'. Ocado, the independent online grocer which sells both branded and Waitrose own-label goods, is in second. Marks & Spencer is in third with Sainsbury's behind them, slightly ahead of the Co-operative. Morrisons and Asda follow, ahead of Tesco, Aldi and Lidl in the table compiled canieatit.co.uk compilers and contributors. 1. Waitrose - score: 9.5 . 2. Ocado - score: 9.0 . 3. Marks & Spencer - score 8.5 . 4. Sainsbury's - score: 8.0 . 5. The Co-operative - score: 7.5 . 6. Morrison's - score: 7.0 . 7. Asda - score: 6.5 . 8. Tesco - score: 6.0 . 9. Aldi - score 5.5 . 10. Lidl - score: 5.0 . Professional food and drink taster Martin Isark, of canieatit.co.uk, said: 'Tesco, like Asda, has not done badly, they have just not improved as much as the supermarkets above them. 'Their aisle staff’s product knowledge is not as good as it could be. Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's lead the way.' He added: 'The staff seem the least at ease of the big supermarkets. 'The fresh fish and meat counters are a big step down from Morrisons with their service and quality. 'The fruit and veg is not as consistent or as good as Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's or the Co-operative. 'The freshly baked bread is a notch below Sainsbury's and no better than Lidl's.' A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We serve millions of customers each week and they tell us they like the improvements we’ve been making as part of the investment in our stores that's currently underway, including more staff on the shop floor to serve customers and better quality ingredients in our products. 'We are not complacent and are only just getting started with the work to build a better Tesco for our customers.' Each chain is given an overall mark out of ten with Waitrose managing 9.5 down to Lidl with just 5.0. Lidl, while cheap, did not offer good quality fresh fruit and veg, though other ranges were improving. There was no customer service desk, own brand labels were too complicated and it was hard getting hold of senior staff. Canieatit.co.uk said there were more complaints about Lidl from his site's users than all the other supermarkets put together. Tesco scores just 6.0 out of ten. Its prices are on a par with Asda and Morrisons said the analysis, but staff are 'the least at ease'. Sainsbury's, who scored 8.0 out of ten, has a better range in some area, like bakery products, and better ready meals and own brands. Its staff are also more friendly and efficient. The Co-op has improved both its range of products and the look of its stores said canieatit.co.uk while Morrisons does particularly well in its booze and fresh fish sections. Some stores have a greater range of fruit and vegetables plus there has been an improvement in upmarket 'foodie' products, said the review. Asda, in seventh, can boast cheerful staff but not necessarily knowledgeable, said the site. Its cafe is 'poor' and the prices, while competitive, are on a par with main rivals.","Tesco was  just 8th place out of the ten major chains .

Apple has agreed to pay a Chinese company $60million to settle a dispute over ownership of the iPad name. The announcement, which came on Monday, removed a potential obstacle to sales of the popular tablet computer in the key Chinese market. Apple Inc. says it bought the global rights to the iPad name from Shenzhen Proview Technology in 2009 but Chinese authorities say the rights in China were never transferred. Doing business: The announcement, which came on Monday, removed a potential obstacle to sales of the popular tablet in the key Chinese market . A Chinese court ruled in December that Proview still owned the name in China and the company asked Chinese authorities to seize iPads. 'The iPad dispute resolution is ended,' the Guangdong High People's Court said in a statement. 'Apple Inc. has transferred $60million to the account of the Guangdong High Court as requested in the mediation letter.' China is Apple's second-largest market after the United States and the source of much of the Cupertino, California-based company's sales growth. Proview hoped for more money but felt pressure to settle because it needs to pay debts, said a lawyer for the company, Xie Xianghui. He said the company had hoped for as much as $400 million and might still be declared bankrupt in a separate legal proceeding despite the infusion of settlement money. Problems: A Chinese court ruled in December that Proview still owned the name in China and the company asked Chinese authorities to seize iPads . 'This is a result that is acceptable to both sides,' Xie said. The dispute centered on whether Apple acquired the iPad name in China when it bought rights in various countries from a Proview affiliate in Taiwan for 35,000 British pounds ($55,000). The December court ruling said Proview, which registered the iPad trademark in China in 2001, was not bound by that sale, even though it was part of the same company.

The bestselling toy from 1998 will come with a price-tag to match its new technology, with pre-orders opening in Walmart in the U.S. this week for $54 (£34). Scroll down for video . The next generation: Hasbro will release the new Furby sometime this fall; the new toy can interact with an iPad and iPhone app . Kaleidoscope eyes: The new Furby will feature LED eyes that convey a multitude of expressions . Nostalgia: The Furby of the 1990s came in a multitude of colours and retailed for about $35 (batteries not included) The makers of Furby, Hasbro Toys, cited the opportunities of the digital age for the 21st century makeover. Kenny Davis, the marking director for the company, told ABC News: ‘The original Furby was more than an animatronic toy; it was the first toy that appeared to have a brain. ‘We have been thinking about ways to give Furby a real personality.’ Among the changes are more sensors, so the new, Furby can respond better to touch. There are also apps for the iPhone and iPad that allow you to ‘feed’ the creature and translate what it says. One thing that hasn’t changed – both versions of the furry toy speak the made-up language Furbish, a made-up language that sounds more like baby talk than anything. The 1990s Furby could eventually be taught some English phrases, though the sentiment that most owners tried to teach it was only three words – ‘Me love you.’ The new Furby will cost nearly double the price of the original, but Hasbro thinks $60 is not too steep a price, especially for the new features. Flying off the shelves: Two women among a crowd of several hundred reach for a Furby at the opening of the FAO Schwarz in October 1998; it was one of the hottest toys for Christmas that year . 90s craze: The Furby craze had several franchises; children are seen surrounding a display of the Furby Buddies at FAO Schwarz in New York City in 1999 . ‘People are looking at $60 video games; we thing people will play with Furby for longer than some of those video games,’ Mr Davis explained to ABC News. When the toy was originally released in the 90s for the price of $35, people across the nation lined up for hours, sometimes camping overnight at toy stores. Around the holidays, Furbies could sell for two to three times their sticker price. The new Furby, available in up to ten colours, will hit shelves in the U.S. in September, according to Walmart. The toy will also be released worldwide. Time will tell if they will be as popular as their antiquated cousins.","New version of popular 1990s toy to be released this autumn .

A school report-style assessment of the health of the world's oceans has concluded that they 'could do better'. The report, based on 10 factors such as clean water, biodiversity, food provision, tourism and coastal protection, gave the oceans a global mark of 60 out of 100. Individual scores differed greatly between coastal countries, with highly developed regions, pristine tropical islands and uninhabited regions doing best. Researchers have given the world's ocean their first 'report card' by studying cleanliness, biodiversity and other factors. Here, a diver in the Maldives, part of the Indian Ocean, dives with a turtle. The UK received an average rating of 62, while the US scored 63 and Canada 70. Sierra Leone in West Africa had the poorest result, 36, while uninhabited Jarvis Island in the South Pacific was awarded the highest rating of 86. Ecologist Dr Karen McLeod, from Oregon State University in the US, one of 30 international scientists who compiled the Ocean Health Index report, said: 'When we conclude that the health of the oceans is 60 on a scale of 100, that doesn't mean we're failing. 'Instead, it shows there's room for improvement, suggests where strategic actions can make the biggest difference, and gives us a benchmark against which to evaluate progress over time. 'The index allows us to track what's happening to the whole of ocean health instead of just the parts.' The results, published in the journal Nature, reflect the gulf between rich and poor parts of the world. Researchers hope the new index will help them track Ocean health, and safeguard wildlife such this whale. Many countries in West Africa, the Middle East, and Central America achieved low scores while higher ratings went to parts of North America, Northern Europe, Australia and Japan. Human activities such as overfishing, coastal development and pollution have taken their toll on the oceans, said the researchers. Lead author Dr Ben Halpern, a US ecologist from the University of California at Santa Barbara, said: 'Is the score far from perfect with ample room for improvement, or more than half way to perfect with plenty of reason to applaud success? I think it's both. ' The 10 goals looked at by the experts were coastal livelihood and economies, sense of place, food provision, natural products, coastal protection, clean waters, artisanal (traditional) fishing opportunity, carbon storage, tourism and recreation, and biodiversity. Different countries performed better or worse in different areas. The UK did well in the natural products, artisanal fishing, clean water and biodiversity categories but had lower scores for coastal protection and tourism and recreation. Among the main findings: . Developed countries generally scored higher than developing countries due to better economies and regulation. Only 55 of countries scored higher than 70, and 32 had ratings below 50. Biodiversity scores were surprisingly high, partly because few known marine species face outright extinction. Global food provision was far below its potential and could be improved if wild-caught fisheries were more sustainably harvested. Restoration of mangroves, salt marshes, coral reefs and seagrass beds could significantly improve ocean health.","School report style study looked at clean water, biodiversity and tourism .

Yet five years after the release of the first iPhone, Apple's legendary designer Sir Jonathan Ive has admitted that the company almost cancelled the product that made him a household name. Sir Jonathan - known affectionately as Jony to Apple fans - said: 'There were multiple times where we nearly shelved the phone because we . thought there were fundamental problems that we can't solve ... [such as] ... where I put the phone to . my ear and my ear dials the number.' The designer was speaking at an Olympic-themed British Business Embassy event this week, which was attended by Kate Middleton and other special guests. The Duchess of Cambridge talks with designer Jonathan Ive at the Royal Academy of Arts in London on Monday . Sir Jonathan talked through Apple's design process, and said Apple did not want to pander to profits or market research, instead just wanting to focus on making great designs and products. He said: 'I refute that design is important. Design is a prerequisite. Good design - innovation - is really hard. 'Really great design is hard. Good is the enemy of great. Competent . design is not too much of a stretch. But if you are trying to do . something new, you have challenges on so many axes. 'We say no to a lot of things that we want to do and are intrigued by so that we only work on a manageable amount of products and can invest an incredible amount of care on each of them.' Explaining his inner processes, Sir Jonathan, who was knighted this year, said: 'We have been, on a number of occasions, preparing for mass production . and in a room and realised we are talking a little too loud about the . virtues of something. 'That to me is always the danger, if I'm trying to . talk a little too loud about something and realising I'm trying to . convince myself that something's good. 'You have that horrible, horrible feeling deep down in your tummy and . you know that it's okay but it's not great. And I think some of the . bravest things we've ever done are really at that point when you say: ""That's good and it's competent, but it's not great"".' The phone that made Apple the biggest tech company on the planet: The iPhone changed everything . Ive also said that market research was never Apple's way: 'It will guarantee mediocrity and will only work out whether you are going to offend anyone.' Ive joined Apple in 1992, when the company was struggling and Steve Jobs had been forced out of the company. But Jobs spotted Ive's eye for detail and minimalist yet ambitious styles, and between them worked together to make technological history. But as Ive said, the process was about making 'the best possible products that we . can, that genuinely means saying no because we don't believe it's good . enough.' Instead, he and Steve Jobs would sit for hours in Ive's workshop, hunched over various prototypes, discussing the tiniest details on each before deciding on to the finished product. And from those meetings, the result was a revolution in the smartphone world.","Technical hurdles - such as what happens when a touchscreen grazes your ear - nearly led to Apple scrapping the device of the century .

The shocking hours worked by engineers at Samsung while creating its mobile phones has been revealed. An engineer who helped develop the Galaxy S phone admitted to only sleeping for 2-3 hours a night while working on the handset. The revelations came as the Korean firm's court battle with Apple intensified. Samsung's Galaxy S handset. Engineers today admitted they only slept for two hours a night while developing it . A Samsung Electronics Co Ltd expert witness testified on Tuesday that Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad violate three of Samsung's patents, as the South Korean electronics company went on offense in the third week of a high stakes trial. Dr. Woodward Yang, an electrical engineering professor at Harvard, said Apple's products use Samsung-patented features for mobile devices, including the process for seamlessly emailing photos. He was one of Samsung's first witnesses after a parade of Apple experts said Samsung phones and tablets violated Apple's patents. Additionally, one of Samsung's designers testified that she did not rely on Apple designs to create icons for Samsung's Galaxy S smartphone line. Apple and Samsung are going toe-to-toe in a patents dispute mirroring a struggle for industry supremacy between two rivals that control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales. The U.S. company accuses Samsung of copying the design and some features of its iPad and iPhone, and is asking for a sales ban in addition to monetary damages. The Korean company, which is trying to expand in the United States, says Apple infringed several patents, including some for its key wireless technology. Apple concluded presenting evidence regarding its own patents this week, and Samsung started calling witnesses. On Tuesday, Yang said Samsung's patents were filed before the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Yang focused on patents that cover smartphone features, not wireless technology. One of those patents covers technology for easily finding photos in an album. 'The idea here was, let's have a bookmark,' Yang said. Under questioning from Apple attorney Bill Lee, Yang acknowledged he had not seen evidence that Samsung actually used any of those features in its own smartphones. Later on Tuesday, Samsung called designer Jeeyuen Wang, who said she and a large Korean team worked hard for three months to create Samsung's own icon designs for Galaxy S phones. 'I slept perhaps two hours, or three hours a night,' Wang said. Apple's iPhone: The legal battle with Samsung centres around several patents relating to smartphones and mobile communications . Apple attorney Michael Jacobs showed Wang internal Samsung documents - with her name on them - containing references to Apple icons. However, under questioning from Samsung attorney John Quinn, Wang said some of those documents were created well after Samsung had finished its own designs. In an attempt to invalidate some of Apple's patents in the case, Samsung also presented evidence this week to show that Apple's patents cover technological advances - like multitouch - that had already been developed before Apple claims to have invented it.","Firm accuses Apple of infringing patents for emailing photos .

And now, thanks to loads of improvements, you’ll be able to feel the passion, speed and glory of the world’s most glamorous sport like never before. Yes, it’s F1 2012, which developers say is the most accessible and immersive F1 game out there. And, as an F1 ‘noob’, I’d have to agree. Formula fun: Yet again, the F1 game is shaping up to be a classic . This is largely due to the ingenious Young Drivers Test. Here, F1 novices are taught the basics of the sport through tutorials, and learn how to get the best from their cars. This even includes how to use the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) and the DRS (Drag Reduction System). When you’re ready, you can test out your moves in a variety of different game modes. These include Champions mode – where you’re thrown straight into the action against one of six world champions (Kimi Räikkönen, Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel and Michael Schumacher) to try and beat them and become the ultimate champion. Then there’s the Season Challenge, where you take part in ten races. You start as a low-ranking team and select a rival driver you think you can beat. As you beat him over a series of races, you will win their seat in the better car – eventually working your way through the field to become champion. Of course, if you’re still not up to the challenge, F1 2012 features all-new lap walk-throughs from F1 test driver Anthony Davidson. Davidson will talk the player through a lap of each of the 20 circuits on the 2012 calendar, highlighting braking points, gearing and giving expert technical advice which will help players find extra speed on every lap. There have been the usual graphical upgrades, too. One massive improvement is the localised weather system. This results in sudden weather changes in different parts of the track. Breathtaking: The attention to detail really is something to behold . When one part of the track is wet while other areas are dry, the race will become more unpredictable and you’ll have to make game-changing strategy calls. 'The whole weather scenario system has really been refined this year,” said Paul Jeal, Game Director. 'You’ll get weather fronts come in now and then and it could be raining at one section of the track but dry on another. 'You get those moments where you’re not sure which tyres to be on and that really mixes up the racing.' The general look has improved, too. The EGO engine has been tweaked so graphics seem sharper this time around. The attention to detail is fantastic, with dynamic lighting shining off the cars. Handling, however, does take some getting used to – no matter what difficulty you’re on, is hard to manage. But it’s incredibly rewarding when you get it right, and there are useful speed / break markers which help keep you on course. 'Significant work has gone into the physics model, particularly the suspension, which has a real change on the feel of the car,’ said Stephen Hood, Creative Director. 'You can really attack the track. It’s those extra elements that make you feel like a real F1 driver.’ And for those after authenticity, then look no further. Photorealistic: Squint your eyes and you'll feel that you're watching a race on TV . All twelve teams and twenty-four drivers competing in the 2012 season will feature, and the brand-new, incomplete Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas — is included in the championship.

Thousands of civil servants who would normally be at their desks in Whitehall have taken advantage of an offer of ‘flexible working’ while the Games are on. And many big blue-chip firms, including the taxpayer-backed Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, have allowed staff to stay away from their offices following apocalyptic warnings of travel chaos. Scroll down for video . Trade hits rock bottom: Small businesses and sole traders vent their anger after messages to stay away from the capital have led to a slump in takings during the Games . Now that it is clear the transport . network is coping with Games visitors, there are calls for both the . public and private sector to rethink ‘work from home’ policies. Retailers . are warning that key parts of London have been turned into ‘ghost . towns’ as workers who would normally be buying lunches, taking taxis, . doing some lunchtime shopping or having an after-work drink stay away. Economists . said many staff would be less productive while working from home – . particularly with the temptation of the Games on TV. More . than half of employers are making changes to their working practices . during the Olympics to enable staff to work more flexibly or to allow . them to watch key events at work, according to the Chartered Institute . of Personnel and Development. Empty: Westfield shopping centre in Shepherds Bush was unusually quiet this week as workers and tourists chose to stay away because of warnings of travel chaos . Where is everyone? A deserted Regent Street in London. Businesses say the centre of the city has become a 'ghost town' during the Olympics . Almost three in ten employers are accommodating requests by staff to work from home. Some 17 per cent said they were extending flexible working opportunities, allowing staff to vary hours, while 13 per cent are actively encouraging staff to work from home. The London Chamber of Commerce estimated that 1.5million of the 5million people who work in London will work from home at some point over the next two weeks. Chief executive Colin Stanbridge said: ‘Eighty per cent of companies offer some form of remote working, and I think up to a million and a half employees will take advantage of that at this special time.’ An estimated 800 Ministry of Justice staff are working from home, while around 400 London-based Department for Work and Pensions staff have relocated to offices outside the capital. In total, more than 4,000 civil servants normally working in London – around six per cent of the total – are thought to have taken advantage of the offer to work from home. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Indications are that less than six per cent of civil servants are working from home and that many more are choosing to do their bit by adapting their commute, with some changing their choice of transport or route and others the times at which they travel.’ Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC, revealed that 40 per cent of its 8,500 staff based in Canary Wharf are working from home – 3,400 individuals. The bank said it was acting on the advice of Transport for London and the Olympics Committee to reduce congestion at some of London’s key Tube stations during the Games. A spokesman rejected claims that staff will be tempted to slack off. He said: ‘People work harder from home. Lots of our staff have a one and a half hour journey to and from work.’ Other firms and institutions to have let workers avoid the chaos that has failed to materialise include the Bank of England, BP and British Gas. Worrying: Restaurants in Covent Garden, normally rammed with tourists, are suffering a downturn in trade as customers stay away from the area . Barely a soul in sight: This was the scene at London Bridge earlier this week. Many workers have been given the option of working from home during the Olympics . Workers on the Woolwich Ferry are the latest transport staff to receive a lucrative bonus simply for doing their job during the Olympics. The Unite union said all 106 workers on the service, which operates between Woolwich and North Woolwich, will get ‘at least £400’. They will also get a better overtime rate on particularly busy days which will be worth double their standard hourly pay. It is the latest in a long line of Olympic windfalls worth up to £1,100 for transport workers in the capital. Lloyds, one of the main Olympics . sponsors, said some of its staff are working from home. The state-backed . bank said this includes ‘non-customer facing’ staff who have to commute . from outside the capital. Hundreds of staff at taxpayer-owned RBS are also expected to work from home and the Bank of England confirmed some staff are also doing so. Drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline, based in West London, said staff have been encouraged to work from home. However, analysts warn that many staff will be less productive than if they were in the office. George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The risk is that you can’t or don’t do as much from home, so while people may report similar hours worked their output – and therefore productivity – will be lower.’ Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, said: ‘The TV coverage of the Olympics will presumably be a big distraction.’ Pierre Williams, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘A lot of small businesses are feeling very hard pressed: not only are they facing the ongoing recession, declining consumer confidence and demand, they are now seeing the expansion of working from home in the public sector.’ Rebecca Clake of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said: ‘Employers should communicate very clearly what their policy is, for example, whether employees are allowed to keep track of the Games online or whether they take a zero-tolerance approach.’ Despite the concerns of business . chiefs, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said today that having the Olympic . Games in London is 'the best possible gift you could ask for' if you . run a tourism business. The cabinet minister said people . needed to take a longer-term view after claims that the 2012 Games have . turned the capital into a 'ghost town', with commuters and non-Olympic . tourists avoiding the city. After figures showed that footfall in . the theatreland and shopping focal point of the West End was down almost . 5 per cent and mayor Boris Johnson admitted that the Games were having a 'patchy' effect on some businesses, Mr Hunt told ITV’s Daybreak that the . Olympics had given the city a global 'cachet' that would boost . long-term tourism. 'I think we have to take a slightly . longer-term view on this - if you have a business in London, . particularly a tourism business - a theatre or restaurant or hotel - . then having the Olympics in London is the best possible gift you could . ask for because that has given London a profile on a global stage,' he . said. 'London is already a well-known city, . it has become absolutely iconic because of these Games and that opening . ceremony has given London a cachet that makes people really want to be . here and come here. 'We have a plan to get four million . additional tourists here over the next four years. It may be a bit up . and down over the next few weeks but it is going to be terrific for . London businesses.' Meanwhile, it was announced today that Westfield Stratford City shopping mall, the gateway to London’s Olympic Park, will be shut at the weekend to people without tickets for the Games to try to manage the crowds. The centre’s stores will still be open to ticket holders but regular shoppers will be turned away between 9.30am and 4pm on Friday and Saturday, the Australian developer. 'We’ve always been working with the Games organisers on crowd management plan for the Olympic Park so it’s always been one option,' a Westfield spokeswoman said. 'We still expect it to be busier than our non-Olympic trading days.' Tomorrow and Saturday are expected to be the Olympic Park’s busiest days when the Olympic Stadium opens up for athletic events. Up to 80,000 more spectators are expected to travel to and from the Olympic Park on Friday alone. The centre, Europe’s biggest urban shopping mall, will be reopened to all visitors outside these hours, Westfield said. It will also be open as normal on Sunday. Westfield does not disclose footfall numbers but the 1.9 million square foot shopping centre, which opened in September last year, is expected to be one of the big winners from the Olympics due to its proximity to the main venues.","Experts warn stayaway policy by civil service and blue-chip firms could inflict damaging blow on capital's economy .

If the Apple Mini does not arrive tomorrow, a number of leaks and images . of prototypes imply the device will be on shelves before Christmas. These images appeared on a Chinese supplier's website, before being spotted by French website nowhereelse.fr. Nowhereelse said the images conform to . previous leaks about the iPad Mini, and their own mocked-up iPad Mini, . based on specifications revealed over the last few months, matched these . covers 'perfectly'. The blog website added: 'In addition, the location of the holes . cut into multiple accessory supposedly designed to protect the iPad Mini . correspond perfectly with the positioning of components.' The leak shows off the purported size of the iPad Mini: This is not an actual model, but a mock-up based on the leaks from suppliers since June . The Apple Mini is believed to sport an eight-inch screen, making it a shrunken version of the iPad's ten-inches. This will allow a higher degree of portability over previous models, and also give Apple the ammunition to compete with Google, which recently brought out a seven-inch range of Nexus tablets. It is also believed to be a 3G-capable model, meaning you can use data on the go. While Steve Jobs was famously against smaller iPads, the success of the Nexus and Amazon's 'Fire' of budget tablets appears to have convinced Apple there is a market for the slim-line device. Rumours from Apple suppliers suggest the innards of the Mini will be equivalent to an iPad 2, which analysts suggest will be more than enough to power the shrunken device. The third iPad had a specification increase but also increased slightly in weight due to the demands of the high-definition Retina display.","iPad Mini device expected to have a screen of eight inches .

A former Melrose Place actress charged in a fatal auto accident two years ago was being chased by another driver causing her reckless behaviour, her attorney told jurors on the first day of her manslaughter trial on Thursday. A prosecutor countered that Amy Locane-Bovenizer, 40, who played Sandy in the original 1990s TV series, was intoxicated causing the crash that killed Helene Seeman and critically injured her husband, Fred. Attorney Blair Zwillman told a Somerville jury that Locane-Bovenizer was chased four miles by a woman whose car she had rear-ended minutes before, The Star-Ledger reported. Showing face: Former Melrose Place actress Amy Locane-Bovenizer is seen teary-eyed in a court hearing last year in what would be her first appearance battling charges of manslaughter . Victims: Helene Zucker Seeman was killed when her car was hit by Locane-Bovenizer's vehicle while also critically injuring her husband, pictured beside her . He said the woman, identified in court as Maureen Ruckelshaus, honked her horn and flashed her lights, causing Locane-Bovenizer to drive nearly 20 mph over the speed limit on narrow country roads. 'Why is she pursuing someone with the most horrendous of distractions possible?' Mr Zwillman asked jurors. 'She began to act as a police officer, which she had no right to do.' The chase ended when the actress slammed into the Seemans' vehicle as it pulled into a driveway. In his opening statement, Somerset County Assistant Prosecutor Matthew Murphy said Locane-Bovenizer had eight to 10 drinks at two gatherings before the accident and had a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit. Prompted: An attorney for the actress seen playing Sandy in the 1990s TV series Melrose Place, left, argued her having been chased by another driver causing her to speed and crash into the Seemans' vehicle . Reality check: Locane-Bovenizer, a mother of two who prosecutors say was highly intoxicated the night of her accident, faces 10 to 30 years in prison if convicted . 'Death was probable, not merely possible,' Mr Murphy told jurors. 'These circumstances were so extreme that death was probable.' Locane-Bovenizer, a mother of two, is charged with aggravated manslaughter and assault by auto and faces up to 30 years in prison if she is convicted. - Somerset County Assistant Prosecutor Matthew Murphy . Locane-Bovenizer appeared on 13 episodes of 'Melrose Place' in 1992 in the role of Sandy Louise Harling. She also appeared in numerous movies including 'Cry-Baby' that also stared Johnny Depp, 'School Ties' and 'Secretary.' During court hearings last summer, a police testified that the actress was found ‘giggling’ and appearing ‘happy’ as she sat in a drainage ditch following the collision in June of 2010. A short time later, the actress asked the officer and emergency medical personnel why they were 'making such a big deal' about applying a neck brace and putting her in an ambulance, Montgomery police officer William Wilkes told the court. 'She said we were being overly dramatic,' said Officer  Wilkes. 'I said, ""The reason I’m making such a big deal is because you were just in a severe two-car collision.""' Violent path: Prosecutors said that Locane-Bovenizer was being chased by a driver upset that the actress had also hit her car, causing her to slam into the vehicle that killed Mrs Seeman, pictured with one of her son's . 'After they had taken a blood sample, at some point she said, ""Am I pregnant or am I just drunk?""' Officer Wilkes told the court. He also recalled that, in the hours following the crash, Locane-Bovenizer urinated in her hospital bed, rambled incoherently and at times seemed unaware of what had just occurred. Officer Wilkes was the second officer to arrive at the crash scene after the emergency call was made at 9.16pm where he found Locane-Bovenizer sitting upright in the nearby ditch. 'Her clothes were a little messed up, dirty,' he recalled to the court. 'Her eyes were bloodshot and watery, her speech was a little slurred.' He added that the actress was 'happy giggling laughing' when he found her and alleged that during the ambulance ride she told emergency personnel that she had consumed four glasses of wine and a beer. In the hospital emergency room, he told the court that Locane-Bovenizer asked several times what had happened to her sport utility vehicle. When Officer Wilkes answered her, he said, 'She kind of acknowledged it and a couple minutes later it would be like that conversation never happened, almost.' Locane-Bovenizer eventually asked, 'I’m sorry, am I getting a DWI?' Officer  Wilkes added. The mother-of-two is married to liquor store owner Mark Bovenizer. Despite the seriousness of the incident, her attorney previously  told website TMZ  that he was 'surprised' at the aggravated manslaughter charge. 'I don't believe it is supported by the law or the facts and I think it constitutes over-reaching by the prosecutor's office,' said Mr Zwillman.","Prosecutors say Amy Locane-Bovenizer, 40, was drunk when she slammed into Helene Seeman's vehicle killing her and critically injuring her husband .

Dozens of objects recovered from the ruins of Roman cities Pompeii and Herculaneum will go on show outside Italy for the first time at a new exhibition at the British Museum. The two cities on the Bay of Naples were wiped out by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The show will feature objects found in their ruins including jewellery, carbonised food and a baby’s crib that still rocks on its curved runners. An employee of the British Museum holds a colourful fragment of wall painting unearthed from the destroyed Roman city of Pompeii, which is set to go on display outside Italy for the first time. Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under a deep layer of ash in an eruption of the Vesuvius volcano, which towers over the Bay of Naples in southern Italy, in AD 79. Just after midday on August 24, . fragments of ash, pumice, and other volcanic debris began pouring down . on Pompeii, quickly covering the city to a depth of more than 9 feet and . causing the roofs of many houses to fall in. Curator Paul Roberts said the 250 objects would illustrate the domestic lives of the population and show the 'different halves of this amazing story'. He said: 'These are not extraordinary cities, they die in an extraordinary way, but they are ordinary cities in Roman terms. 'That’s why they are so important because we can look at them and say we have a pretty good idea what was going on in other Roman cities.' Mr Roberts said the 400 to 500 centigrade volcanic avalanche that buried Herculaneum had preserved many objects including furniture and food. He said: 'It was buried in a different way from Pompeii and the effect of that as this cloud of superheated gas and debris swirled around the houses of Herculaneum it carbonised, it turned into charcoal wood, leather and even food.' Six pieces of carbonised furniture, including the crib, will be lent to the British Museum in what Mr Roberts said was 'a world first'. He said there would also be “a loaf of bread that was put in the oven in AD79 and came out in the 1930s” complete with the namestamp of the slave who baked it. Other exhibits include peppercorns rescued from the drains, carbonised figs, a lamp and wall paintings. A a plaster cast of a dog, from the House of Orpheus, Pompeii, AD 79 that will go on show .

Mr Roberts said: 'The exhibition . isn’t about death, you had to have the death of the cities in order to . bring them to life again, but the exhibition is all about the life of . these people. 'Domestic life is something we all share. 'We don’t all go to the baths, we don’t all go to the amphitheater - but we all have a home,' he said. The exhibition, which is sponsored by .

Super healthy schoolboy Jack Thomas from Oakdale, South Wales, died in his girlfriend's arms while having a cup of tea . A healthy sports-mad schoolboy who died watching TV had nothing wrong with him, an inquest heard today. Jack Thomas, 15, was photographed looking happy and smiling less than five minutes before he suddenly stopped breathing. The keen sportsman let out a 'couple of light groans' as he sipped a cup of tea and then died in his girlfriend’s arms. The inquest heard a post mortem examination found that Jack was 'a perfectly healthy, normal teenager' with no medical problems. Pathologist Dr Edward Williams said: 'There was no sign of any injury and no abnormalities in the heart and arteries.' Jack had represented Wales at Taekwondo and was an accomplished rugby player, cricketer and all round sportsman. The inquest heard Jack, of Caerphilly, South Wales, had walked three miles to his girlfriend’s home on the day of the tragedy in February. Jack and his girlfriend Emily Brown, 15, settled down on the settee to watch Wales play Scotland in rugby’s Six Nations. Her father Richard Brown told the hearing: 'At half time Emily took photographs of Jack smiling and pulling faces. 'But then she realised something was wrong. 'Jack tipped his cup of tea over himself and let out a couple of light groans.' Mr Brown carried out CPR on Jack until an ambulance arrived. He added: 'Jack was at our home for about 40 minutes and didn’t complain of feeling unwell.' The inquest in Newport recorded a verdict that Jack died of natural causes. It was said 'the most likely cause of death' was cardiac arrhythmia where the heart beats out of control - but leaves no trace that can be seen in a post mortem. Mourning: His devastated mother June, (left) younger brother Owain (second from right) and father Grant (right) are 'in bits' at the death of their beloved Jack . Jack was 'full of life and energy' and on the day he died walked three miles to his girlfriend's home . Gwent Coroner David Bowen told the teenager’s parents: 'Jack had not been in an accident and there was no sign of drugs or alcohol in his bloodsteam. 'This may not provide you with the clear-cut answer you were looking for, but whatever it was, it was wholly natural in origin. 'Jack would have known nothing at all - there would have been no warnings.' He was predicted to get A stars in his GCSEs this summer and had won a place at a sixth form college. His heartbroken parents Grant and June Thomas are now campaigning for young people to be screened for potential heart defects . Mrs Thomas said: 'He was a very happy, intelligent, fun-loving young man. 'None of us will ever forget him - he’ll be in our hearts for ever.' Electrician Mr Thomas said: 'Jack had never been ill in his life - the worst illness he’d had was tonsillitis and had his tonsils out when he was three. 'He was full of life and energy - he was a super-fit Taekwondo expert who trained six times a week. 'We as a family are in bits, words don’t even come close to to explaining how we feel.

The huge pile of cash handed to the European Union by the UK has soared to a whopping £53 million per day, it was revealed today. Britain's annual contribution for being a member is now at a record £19.2 billion and the nation is getting back even less cash in return, the Office for National Statistics has revealed. In 2010 the UK's overall bill was £18.2billion, meaning that the £1 billion increase last year is an inflation-busting five per cent rise. This means that now every Briton is contributing £300 a year each to maintain our link with Brussels. Bill: Britain now pays £19.2 billion per year to the EU in Brussels, pictured, an increase of £1 billion . And after taking into account what the country gets back in subsidies for forming and regional development projects, Britain paid £8.4billion more than it received last year compared to £7.3 billion in 2010 - an increase of £1.1 billion. In total since 1979, Britain has paid in . about £228 billion and has received back in benefits . just £143 billion. After Angela Merkel's Germany, Britain is the second highest contributor of the 27 EU members. Claims: David Cameron says he has got a good deal for Britain and maintains he doesn't want to leave the EU . UKIP leader and MEP Nigel Farage said: '19 billion here, 19 billion there, pretty soon we are talking real money. In our terms this is as much as we spend on the Home Office and Justice combined. 'That the daily figure has topped £53 million a day is astonishing and something that this Government just cannot be proud of while it attempts to rein in the scourge of public spending. 'We know the costs of Europe, the question remains, what are the benefits? Cameron refuses to sanction a proper study into this, and we know why, there is simply no justification for taking so much from the public purse to fritter elsewhere. Of course by the public purse I mean the taxpayer.' David Cameron is facing huge pressure from the public and his own party over Britain's membership of the EU. Just weeks ago the . Prime Minister said he wanted a ‘new settlement’ with Europe, but . suggested this would stop short of Britain quitting the EU. Mr . Cameron criticised Eurosceptics who want to leave, saying their vision . for Britain would create ‘a sort of greater Switzerland... that would be . a complete denial of our national interest’. Asked . whether he could ever envisage campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, . Mr Cameron replied: ‘I don’t think we should leave the EU. Big spenders: Only Angela Merkel's Germany gives more to the EU than Britain . ‘But . I think we should be, over time, seeking a new settlement and receiving . a new mandate for that settlement. Because I think the change taking . place in Europe is very profound. I’m an optimist. I think this is . perfectly possible.’ The Prime Minister has already accepted a 2.8 per cent increase in next year's EU budget but the Government maintains they are getting a good deal. 'The Government has consistently pressed for restraint in the EU budget and achieved a real-terms freeze in the 2012 budget,' A Treasury spokesman told the Express.

All smiles: Cuba's leader Fidel Castro appeared jovial when he appeared in public earlier this year, but he has not been seen since March . He may not have showed up for the party, but that did not stop the rest of Cuba celebrating Fidel Castro's 86th birthday yesterday. Messages of congratulation were broadcast over the state media and cultural centres organised concerts in honour of the retired leader. A special art show in the . Plaza of the Revolution depicted moments in Castro's life from childhood . to his arrival as one of the most recognized figures in Latin American . history. The Union of Communist Youth also joined in with a small party featuring a huge cake and children singing Cuba's version of the 'Happy Birthday' song. Government-run websites carried essays on . his life and best wishes were sent from presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia and . Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. But through it all, the 'comandante' was nowhere to be seen. Castro, who survived in power for nearly 50 years despite numerous attempts on his life and periodic rumours of his passing, still appears to have a strong hold on people's affections - even if he is not physically seen for months at a time. He had stepped aside temporarily in 2006, due to an illness that he later said nearly killed him, and in 2008 he left the presidency permanently. Younger brother Raul, who turned 81 earlier this year, took over. Castro doesn't seem to have much of a . hand in running the country, though he has publicly voiced approval for . Raul's programme of economic reforms and the younger Castro says he . consults with his brother. The exact nature of Castro's illness was . never revealed and the status of his health is kept secret, but media . reports said it was complications from diverticulitis, an intestinal . ailment common in older people. Scroll down for video . Celebrating for Castro: Children wait to get a slice at an event honoring Fidel Castro's 86th birthday in Havana . Icing on the cake: The message in Spanish reads 'Congratulations Commander' Despite being out of the limelight, Castro regularly published an opinion column titled . 'Reflections', which have often been lengthy essays on international . politics. These have often taken on the form of short, sometimes cryptic messages. In one of the mysterious . mini-'Reflections' Castro wrote about something called the 'FC' without . explicitly saying what they were. Others marvelled at yoga masters' flexibility, extolled the nutritive virtues of a tree known as moringa . and reproduced six lines of poetry about Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. In their hearts: Children sang Happy Birthday to the famed revolutionary, while a man hangs a picture of Castro . But he has not published a column since June and Castro last appeared in photos and . video in March. At that time, Castro looked jovial, but thin and pale as he and companion . Dalia Soto del Valle greeted a visiting Pope Benedict XVI. As Castro passes yet another milestone, he is perhaps becoming increasingly aware of his own mortality. He seemed to hint at this in a letter to his friend and ally Hugo Chavez in July, when the Venezuelan president turned 58. 'Fifty-eight years is nothing, Hugo,' Castro wrote in the letter, which was posted online by Venezuela's . office of the presidency and reproduced by Cuban website Cubadebate. 'I, who am almost 28 years older, have lived a great part of the last 100 years and can testify as to the meaning of time.' Important figure: Despite not being seen in public for a while, Castro is still a large figure in people's lives . Without the public appearances and fewer published columns, rumours have inevitably begun to swirl over where Castro is - and how he is. 'Has Cuba converted Fidel Castro into a . virtual figure?' opposition blogger Yoani Sanchez tweeted. 'He doesn't . appear, but they tell us he's still alive.' But it also seems that people do not have to see the famed revolutionary with their own eyes to keep believing in him. 'Just his being there, alive, gives . people a lot of strength to keep working and fighting,' said Gerardo . Cartaya, a 53-year-old self-employed cab driver in Havana. In recognition of his birthday, Communist Party newspaper Granma also published memories of Castro from people familiar with him, such as Cuban journalists and cohorts from the 1959 revolution, which relate the awe with which people still hold him. 'Every time I meet with Fidel I feel like I have had to stand up and defend him against whatever they might want to do to him,' famed Cuban ballerina Alicia Alonso was quoted as saying in Granma's collection of memories. 'Every time I meet with him I feel nervous.' In the frame: Children take a picture in front of a mural of Fidel Castro, who still has a strong hold over the people of Cuba .

Most midsize luxury cars -- including the $35,700 Mercedes-Benz C-Class -- performed poorly in a new frontal crash test developed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The new test is designed to replicate what happens when a car strikes another car or a fixed object like a tree or utility pole. The test strikes 25 percent of a car’s front end into a five-foot rigid barrier at 40 miles per hour. The results don’t bode well for non-luxury models, which will be the next to undergo the new test. Insurance Institute crash test results are closely watched by the auto industry and often lead to changes in design or safety features. Good scores are also frequently touted in car ads. Scroll down to see crash test videos . Failed: The Mercedes-Benz C-Class earned the lowest grade for the new test. The collision resulted in significant trauma to the crash test dummy . Deadly: The Audi A4 was another model that failed a partial-frontal crash. Head-on collisions kill about 10,000 Americans each year . Of the 11 cars tested, only the Acura TL, Volvo S60 and Infiniti G earned good or acceptable ratings from the institute, which is funded by insurers. Four cars -- the Acura TSX, BMW 3 Series, Lincoln MKZ and Volkswagen CC -- earned marginal ratings. Four others — the Mercedes C-Class, Lexus IS 250, Audi A4 and Lexus ES 350 — earned poor ratings. Marginal or poor ratings indicate the cars wouldn’t protect occupants very well in a real-world crash. All of the cars tested were from the 2012 model year. Safe: The 2012 Acura TL fared well in this crash test and was one of only two vehicles to earn the highest rating from the IIHS . Back to the drawing board: Many manufacturers base new car designs on IIHS crash tests, in an effort to improve the ratings of their cars . Only three 2012 models of luxury cars fared well in a new partial-frontal crash test by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Here is a list of all 11 models, along with their suggested retail price: . The institute said the new test indicates . that side air bags -- which are designed for direct impact, T-bone . crashes but not for off-center, frontal ones -- may not go off in time . or extend far enough to protect occupants. In three cars -- the BMW, . Mercedes and Volkswagen -- the seat belts spooled out too much after the . crash, causing the crash-test dummies to strike hard surfaces. The . Volkswagen’s door was completely sheared off during the test. Mercedes said it didn’t agree with its . ranking and pointed out that the C-Class is listed as one of the . institute’s top safety picks. Mercedes said the crash test mimics an . unusually severe and uncommon scenario. 'As a leader in automotive safety, we have full confidence in the protection that the C-Class affords its occupants -- and less confidence in any test that doesn’t reflect that,' Mercedes said in a statement. Toyota Motor Co, which owns the Lexus brand, accepted the results. 'With this new test, the Institute has raised the bar again and we will respond to this challenge as we design new vehicles,' Toyota said. But Toyota also noted that it has more top safety picks -- 17 -- than any other automaker. The Insurance Institute said it plans to change its criteria for the top safety picks next year to incorporate the new test. The group said developed the test after years of analyzing real-world frontal crashes, which kill more than 10,000 people annually in the US. Acura TL crash video: . Volvo S60 crash video: .

A 23-year-old woman who devoted her life to saving animals was mauled to death by dogs she had lovingly rescued. Rebecca Carey, of Decatur, Georgia, worked in an animal clinic and had been taking in abandoned animals for 10 years. But, in a tragic turn of fate, the college student was savagely killed sometime over the weekend by at least one of the dogs she had rescued. Loving: Rebecca Carey, of Decatur, Georgia, worked in an animal clinic and had been taking in abandoned animals for 10 years . Authorities say Carey had five dogs living with her at the time of her death, including a pit bull she had owned for six years. The other dogs included another pit bull, a boxer mix she had taken in and a Presa, a large Spanish breed. She was also dogsitting another Presa for her friend, Jackie Cira. Cira discovered Carey’s mauled body on Sunday afternoon after her friend failed to show up for work at Alpharetta's Loving Hands Animal Clinic. 'There was a lot of blood,' Cira told wsbtv.com. 'And when first got there, it looked like she had fallen and hit her head.' Police initially thought they were . dealing with a homicide but the DeKalb County medical examiner ruled . Carey's death the result of dog bites. DeKalb . County police spokeswoman Mekka Parish says all of the dogs were . euthanized on Wednesday with the consent of Carey's parents. Euthanized: Two of Carey's dogs who were later euthanized . Animal lover: Carey volunteered countless hours with rescue networks and animal shelters . Cira told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Carey would have been devastated to find out that her dogs has been put down, adding that it would have been possible to determine which animals were responsible for the attack. 'We're talking about three very different breeds weighing around 80 pounds, 55 pounds and 15 pounds,' she said. But, Tim Medlin, interim director of DeKalb Animal Control, told wsbtv.com that would not have been possible. 'We didn’t know which dog did which,' he said. 'I can’t be wrong. Not just myself, no one can be wrong in putting out a dog that possibly had to do with these type of injuries. I will not put another person at that kind of risk.' Cira said that Carey, a skilled dog handler, was experienced when it came to dealing with aggressive animals. 'If she found out it was a dangerous . dog, they were gone,' she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'She . felt strongly that dangerous dogs had no business being in society where . they could attack a child or something.' Location: A photo of some cages in Carey's home in Decatur where she was tragically mauled to death . Cira added to the newspaper that perhaps Carey had fallen on her head after attempting to break up a fight between the dogs. Carey's parents, Greg and Ellen Carey, released the following statement after their daughter's tragic death. ‘Rebecca Carey of Decatur was 23 years old and an avid animal lover. 'Since the second grade when she read the book ""Throw Away Pets,"" she vowed to be a voice for all animals.' Betsy Duffey's novel follows the lives of two girls who find a dog, a cat, and a rabbit in a temporary animal shelter and try to find them homes before they are put to sleep by the authorities. ‘Upon placing her first abandoned animal in a permanent loving home in 2003, she volunteered countless hours with rescue networks and animal shelters,' the Carey family statement continued. ‘There she did what she loved the most: rescuing animals from untenable situations to find them safe, loving homes.’ In a similar case, a 44-year-old man was killed by his pet pitbull and later found by his wife with the dog on top of him, gnawing at his neck. Charles Hagerman has multiple injuries consistent with a dog attack when he was discovered at 8.15pm on Wednesday lying in the living room of the couple's home on the south side of Chicago. Police were trying to determine if one or both of the couple's two dogs attacked him.","Friends of Rebecca Carey say the 23-year-old would be devastated to learn that all of the dogs were put down .

His sensational victories in the 5,000m and 10,000m – and trademark 'Mo-bot' celebration – have put Farah on course to earn millions of pounds in lucrative sponsorship deals. Mo Farah's twin brother Hassan is pictured doing the 'Mobot' outside his home in Hargeisa, Somaliland . Mo Farah was sent to England with his two older brothers to live with their father, while Hassan stayed behind . Hassan Farah pictured in the market in his home town of Hergeisa in Somaliland . Hassan – who was also a gifted runner – . was separated from Mo as an eight-year-old and is left to wonder what . he could have achieved in athletics if he hadn't been forced to stay . behind in the lawless East African country. The 29-year-old twins were separated . in 1991 when their parents made the agonising decision for Mo to join . his father as an asylum seeker in Britain. Mo Farah yesterday added a . lucrative sponsorship deal with Virgin Media to his growing portfolio of . endorsement contracts as he reaps the rewards of his gold medals. The 29-year-old will earn between . £250,000 and £500,000 in an advertising campaign with fellow Olympic . hero Usain Bolt. Both runners will wear Richard Branson goatee beards. It will take the earnings of the winner of the 10,000m and 5,000m titles up to an estimated £2.5 million a year. Before the Games, Farah earned a . reported £500,000 in endorsements, including sponsorship deals with . Lucozade and retail giant Nike. Scottish Widows, the official . pension provider for the Olympics, predicts he will pocket about . £5 million by the Rio Games in 2016 – and he could command a £1 million . appearance fee if he runs in the London Marathon next year. Despite the grinding poverty Hassan . has become a successful telecommunications engineer with a wife and five . children, and a comfortable home. Hassan grew up amid dust and poverty . and has watched without bitterness or resentment as his brother, who . excelled on the sports fields of England, became a world-class athlete. 'Like many Somali families we were . torn apart by war. In my case it felt more tragic than most.

Sometimes I would beat him as we chased each other around, sometimes he would beat me. 'But now he has had the most . technically-advanced training and advice available in the world, with . top running tracks and gyms to work in, and I have had nothing. 'Who knows what I could have become? We could have been famous twin Olympic athletes. I couldn't help . thinking about that when I was watching him in the races on television. 'But he's my brother, I love him and I rejoice in his great successes.' Mo's phenomenal success followed years of rigorous training, after he was recognised as a major talent by his PE teacher.

A Syrian rebel commander has issued a chilling warning to Western leaders - either help us topple Bashar Assad, or we will forge an alliance with Al Qaeda. Abu Ammar, who is currently fighting troops loyal to Bashar Assad in the flashpoint northern city of Aleppo, warned that his forces are struggling to cope. He said: 'We don't want Al-Qaeda here, but if nobody else helps us, we will make an alliance with them. Scroll down for video . Turning to Al Qaeda? Members of the Free Syrian Army fighters pose near damaged tanks after clashes with forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad . 'And you can bet if Al-Qaeda comes here, they will brainwash the people. 'If Al-Qaeda enters Aleppo, the city will become their base within three months.' The Iraqi government has confirmed that Al Qaeda fighters have been crossing from Iraq into Syria to carry out attacks on government forces. And U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted recently that he believes Al-Qaeda might well be responsible for a string of recent suicide bombings in Syria. Testifying before the Senate Armed Services, Mr Clapper said the blasts in Syrian cities since last December 'had all the earmarks of an Al-Qaeda-like attack'. He added: 'We believe Al-Qaeda in Iraq is extending its reach into Syria.' Rebel fighters carry the body of a comrade during clashes in the flashpoint city of Aleppo . Under siege: A rebel fighter takes cover during clashes in Aleppo. Rebel commander Abu Ammar has warned that if Al-Qaeda enter the city it will become their base within three months . Syria's opposition has frequently called on a divided and deadlocked international community to act to halt President Bashar al-Assad's campaign of repression against a peaceful uprising that is now an armed insurgency. It is pushing for the establishment of a no-fly zone similar to the one the United Nations authorised for Libya last year, or the channelling of weapons to the poorly equipped rebel Free Syrian Army. But the FSA remains massively outweighed by the regular army. 'May God help us because it is impossible to defeat this regime,' said Abu Ammar. 'They have chemical weapons they will possibly use. 'They have tanks, planes, mortars, rockets and we have nothing. 'We want them to give us weapons to defend ourselves or to intervene militarily. We are angry. The Syrian people still like the European countries, but if it continues like this, you end up hating them.' Experts have repeatedly warned that the uprising could take on an increasingly radical flavour, if calls for assistance went unheeded.

The Iraqi government has confirmed that Al Qaeda fighters have been crossing from Iraq into Syria to carry out attacks on government forces . Syrian children play near a destroyed tank in the town of Azaz on the outskirts of Aleppo. Rebels fear government forces may begin to use chemical weapons . In recent months, reports of foreign jihadists flocking to Syria via its porous border with Turkey have raised alarm, although fighters and analysts say there is no big Al-Qaeda presence yet. However, a State Department report last month said the Iraqi branch was believed to be extending its reach into Syria to try to exploit the uprising. The number of Al-Qaeda fighters in Syria was believed to be small, State Department coordinator for counterterrorism, Daniel Benjamin, said. 'But there is a larger group of foreign fighters, many of whom are not directly affiliated with AQ, who are either in or headed to Syria. And clearly, this is a matter of concern for all who fear greater violence in Syria and for regional stability.' An AFP journalist in Aleppo said last month he saw foreign fighters who claimed to hail from countries as varied as Algeria, Chechnya, France and Sweden come to join Syrian rebel group, the Tawhid Brigade. Another reporter said he saw fighters from a number of Arab countries including Saudi Arabia at a border crossing between Turkey and northern Syria. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, centre, said he believes Al-Qaeda is behind a string of recent suicide bombings in Syria . 'Why doesn't the government of your country do anything to help us?' Abu Ahmed, a fighter with the Martyrs of Atareb Battalion in the rebel-held Aleppo district of Sukari, pleaded with an AFP photographer. 'In Libya, they helped get rid of (now slain dictator Moamer) Gadaffi, but here in Syria they leave us to die.' Analysts said there were already several splinter groups on the ground who employ the same methods as Al-Qaeda. Fears of Iraq-style violence multiplied in May when twin suicide bombings in Damascus killed at least 55 people and wounded several hundred - the deadliest attacks since the uprising erupted in March 2011. Al-Nusra Front, an Islamist group unknown before the revolt, claimed responsibility for the bombings as well as previous attacks in Damascus and Aleppo. Washington, which has long accused Damascus of turning a blind eye to extremists crossing through into Iraq, has refused to supply arms to the rebels, lest they fall into the hands of Al-Qaeda. In February, when Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri openly expressed support for the Syrian revolt, rebel groups rejected his statement as 'interference.' From the start of the uprising, Assad's regime has claimed to be fighting a foreign-planted, Islamist insurgency led by 'armed terrorist groups.' Though activists have frequently mocked the regime's discourse, they also sense the emergence of radical groups whose agenda is not freedom and democracy, but the establishment of an Islamic state. The majority of Syria's population is Sunni Muslim, but the country is led by the Alawite Assad clan. Members of the Alawite community - an offshoot of Shiite Islam - are considered by radical Islamists as apostates. Though many rebels may not share this view, there are growing signs that they may be willing to make a pact with even the most radical groups to bring Assad down. 'The main aim is to stop this bloodshed in Aleppo. If neither the West nor the Arabs will help us, we will ask for the help of Al-Qaeda to stop the bloodshed,' said Baraa, an anti-regime activist in Aleppo, who said Al-Qaeda's possible presence would not mean that they would take over. 'In the end, the people of Aleppo will decide their fate,' Baraa told AFP via Skype. 'The people who have stood against and fought a dictator like Bashar al-Assad... I am sure that the same people can also fight Al-Qaeda.' - VIDEO: After a four-day battle rebels claim control of the town of Kafaranbel in the northwest Ildib province… .","Washington spy chief claims he believes terrorist organisation could be behind recent string of suicide bombings in Syria .

A lance corporal has been arrested accused of kidnapping two young soldiers and torturing them overnight. The unnamed soldier, 23, from 1 Mercian regiment, is said to have tied the victims up and subjected them to a series of beatings at Catterick Garrison, in North Yorkshire. The ordeal ended when one managed to break free from the car and raise the alarm after he bundled one into the boot and forced the other onto the back seat before attempting to drive out of the base, a source claimed.

They were said to be 'traumatised' by the ordeal. The incident comes four years after five military instructors were suspended amid allegations of . physical abuse and harassment at the same base - the British Army's largest in the world. An investigation has been launched by the Ministry of Defence into what drove the Afghanistan veteran to 'flip' in such dramatic fashion. One suggestion is that the soldier suffered a mental breakdown sparked by his experiences on the Afghan battlefield in 2010. A source told The Sun: 'He tied them up, tried to suffocate them — and kicked and punched them overnight. 'It was a horrific ordeal. The two victims have been left traumatised.

A dog owner killed a man by dropping a fridge on his head after becoming convinced his pet had been kidnapped, a murder trial heard today. Cameron McFly, 38, believed his victim, Richard Ward, 37, had taken the dog and entered it into an illegal fight, the OId Bailey was told. He is alleged to have attacked Mr Ward after leading him into a darkened alley behind a supermarket. McFly punched and kicked his victim before stealing his cash and using it to buy cigarettes and alcohol, a jury was told. He then returned to finish off the attack by dropping the kitchen appliance on the victim’s head as Danny Samuel, 36, joined in the savage beating, the court heard. 'Attack': Cameron McFly and Danny Samuel are on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of murdering Richard Ward last November . McFly is said to have made a calculated effort to cover his tracks by burning his clothes and shaving off his hair. He admits he was responsible for the attack on Mr Ward, but claims he was suffering from mental illness at the time. Samuel claims he was invited into the alley by McFly, but insists he took no part in the attack which followed. Mr Ward was attacked in the loading bay of a Waitrose supermarket in Severus Road, Clapham Junction, south-west London, on November 7 last year. He was caught on CCTV at around 10.50pm holding both of McFly’s dogs on leads, the court heard. Minutes later, he was guided to the rear of the supermarket before being ‘systematically assaulted’ by McFly, prosecutor Roger Smart told the court. ‘The prosecution say that McFly used kicks and punches directed towards the head of Richard Ward, he told jurors. ‘This is the last time Richard Ward is seen alive.’ He was disturbed midway through his attack and fled to a nearby Sainsbury’s store where he bought cans of pre-mixed Jack Daniels and Coke and a pack of 10 JPS cigarettes. Prosecutors believe he paid for the goods with money stolen from his victim. He was also seen flirting with a female customer. The court was told that McFly met up with Samuel while he was returning to the Waitrose yard and boasted about the attack he had launched minutes earlier. Samuel claims that when he asked McFly what the victim had done to him, he replied: ‘Oh, kidnap the dog and put it in a dog fight and everything else.’ It was shortly afterwards that the two men resumed the attack, which culminated in McFly dropping a fridge on Mr Ward’s head, the court heard. The pair fled when they were disturbed by Waitrose staff. DNA from both McFly and Samuel was found on a car parked in the loading bay, along with McFly’s fingerprints, the jury was told. McFly and Samuel, both of Hebdon Road, Tooting, south-west London, deny murder. The trial continues.

A graduate student from St. Louis, Missouri, who was severely injured in a chimp attack at a refuge in South Africa is now awake and communicating, his doctor announced on Thursday. Saint Louis University chief of plastic surgery Dr Bruce Kraemer said Andrew Oberle Jr had undergone three surgeries since arriving at the hospital less than two weeks ago. Speaking at a news conference, Kraemer said Oberle, 26, had injuries all over his body, but reports that he had an arm severed in the attack were inaccurate, though he did lose fingers. Team Andrew: Plastic surgery Dr Bruce Kraemer, left, and Andrew Oberle's mother, Mary Flint, spoke to the press to offer an update on the condition of the injured 26-year-old student . Victim: Andrew Oberle (pictured) suffered severe injuries all over his body at the hands of two chimpanzees . Oberle was mauled by chimpanzees on June 28 while giving a tour at the Jane Goodall Institute's Chimpanzee Eden SA. The 26-year-old anthropology and primatology student from the University of Texas–San Antonio was working at the sanctuary as part of his graduate program. Two chimps named Amadeus and Nikki lunged at Oberle, pulling him under an electric fence and dragging him about a half-mile. Attacked: Oberle, a University of Texas graduate student, was mauled while leading a tour at the Jane Goodall Institute in South Africa . Dangerous beasts: Alpha males Nikki (left) and Amadeus (right) who pounced on Oberle at the South African reserve where he was studying their behaviour . Animal lover: Oberle poses with one of his charges at the refuge . The refuge said it was the first attack since the center opened six years ago with the goal of saving abused animals . Oberle suffered large cuts to his head and face that left his skull and facial bones exposed. He was kept in a medically induced coma until his return to St. Louis. Kraemer said the majority of Oberle’s wounds are now closed and covered, and he is poised to begin the rehabilitation process. The surgeon added that the 26-year-old ‘has a very strong spirit. His attitude is phenomenal. ‘He’s dealt with horrific pain but is just a sweet, loving guy who just wants to have his privacy respected now so he can figure things out on his own,’ Kraemer said. Serious injuries: Oberle suffered cuts to his face and skull, and lost several fingers in the brutal attack . Moving forward: The animals involved in the attack (not pictured) were reintroduced at the center in July under supervision . Oberle faces a long recovery and may . be treated with new technologies in regenerative medicine and . prosthetics that would possibly allow the graduate student to ‘grow . back’ what he lost, according to his doctor. ‘Everything . he wanted to do (before the attack) perhaps he’ll have some . limitations,’ Kraemer said, according to KMOX. ‘I guess in the bigger context he’s been . saved.’ At the press . conference, Oberle's mother, Mary Flint, gave a brief statement in which . she thanked doctors and staff at the hospital, along with relatives, . friends ‘and all the wonderful people from all over the world who have . kept Andy and all of us in their prayers and for helping us with . donations for his care.’ Officials at the chimpanzee refuge reintroduced the animals at the center in late July, under careful supervision. Uphill battle: The 26-year-old man will have to go through a lengthy process of rehabilitation that may involve regenerative medicine . Prognosis: Oberle's surgeon said thanks to new technologies, the young man, pictured, may be able to 'grow back' the parts he lost in the attack, but he is likely to face limitations . Amadeus, . the alpha male, had been held in solitary confinement since the June . attack. Nikki was shot in the abdomen and leg, and was transferred from . the Johannesburg Zoo back to the refuge. Speaking . to ABC’s 20/20 last week, institute director Eugene Cussons said the . chimps both had difficult upbringings before coming to the refuge, and . should be considered victims along with Oberle. Cussons also said that Oberle had a lapse in judgement by approaching too close to the fence while conducting the tour, and he should have been more careful in the presence of wild animals. Strong: 200-lb chimpanzee Travis attacked in 2009. Experts warned chimps can be up to six times as strong as a human . In 2009 Charla Nash, 58, almost died in a . horrific mauling that saw her lose her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands . after being savaged by Travis, a dangerous 200-pound chimpanzee. She received a revolutionary . full-face transplant in June 2011 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, nearly two years after the attack. The operation – performed by a team of more than 30 surgeons and nurses – and subsequent recovery were widely covered. Prior to the surgery, she hid her face under a veil, saying that she chose to wear it ‘so I don’t scare people.’ In an interview Ms Nash told the Hartford Courant that she feels no different than she did before the attack. ‘I just feel like it’s my face,’ she said. ‘It’s just not working real good. Every day, my muscles get better.' In past interviews, . Ms Nash revealed that having a new face allowed her simple human . pleasures – she has regained her sense of smell and can eat again. She is even regaining sensation in her forehead, cheeks, eyebrow, and nose. But most of all, she’s learning how to smile. ‘It creases up here,’ Ms Nash told the Courant as she pointed at her mouth. ‘I don’t know what the future’s doing (sic) to bring… so I don’t get my hopes up,’ Ms Nash said. But she added that she wants to progress far enough that she can again ride horses and live in her own house. She . said she misses simple things – like being able to bargain hunt, bask . in the sunshine, or even look at her 20-year-old daughter, Brianna. ‘I have to depend on a lot of help,’ she said. ‘My life depends on really not being alone. I used to be very independent.’ Recovery: Six months in, Ms Nash showed off her face transplant surgery. Surgeons spent 20 hours re-building her features . She also gets phantom pains in her hands, despite the fact that they were removed after the 2009 attack. Transplants added in surgery later had to be removed because of dangerous complications. In an interview with ABC 7 last month, Ms Nash – who likes being called Charlie – said she doesn’t want anybody’s pity. ‘I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me,’ she said. ‘I want to be like everyone else.’ She has been told by doctors that she needs to work on bulking up, as she is still quite thin for her 5ft 10in frame. Ms Nash, who was blinded in the 2009 . attack, was fitted with brown glass eyes and hopes to get a double hand . transplant after the first one failed. Ara . Chekmayan, a spokesman for the Nash family, told the Mail Online: 'The . horrific chimpanzee attack that occurred today involving the American . student further highlights the danger that these animals pose and their . violent nature. 'Charla . Nash knows as well as anyone the tremendous harm that a chimpanzee can . inflict. Her thoughts and prayers go out to the young man and his . family.'

As the income gap between rich and poor widens, a majority of Americans say the growing divide is bad for the country and believe that wealthy people are paying too little in taxes, according to a new survey. The poll released Monday by the Pew Research Center points to a particular challenge for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, whose party's policies are viewed by a wide majority as favoring the rich over the middle class and poor. The poll found that many Americans believe rich people to be intelligent and hardworking but also greedy and less honest than the average American. Voices: A protestor showed the disgruntled feelings that many hold towards Republican consideration of extending the Bush-era tax cuts for some of the wealthiest Americans . Satirical: As the Republican National Convention is due to kick off with gusto on Tuesday, a new poll was released showing a majority of Americans believe that wealthy people are paying too little in taxes . Nearly six in 10, or 58 per cent, say the rich don't pay enough in taxes, while 26 per cent believe the rich pay their fair share and 8 per cent say they pay too much. Even among those who describe themselves as 'upper class' or 'upper middle class', more than half said upper-income Americans don't pay enough in taxes; only 10 per cent said they paid too much. The findings come at the start of this week's Republican National Convention and as both Romney and President Barack Obama seek to appeal to a broad swath of financially struggling voters who identify as middle class. Romney supports an extension of Bush-era tax cuts for everyone including the wealthiest 2 per cent, and says his policies will benefit the middle class by boosting the economy and creating jobs. 'The fact that Romney may be viewed as wealthy doesn't necessarily pose problems for his candidacy,' said Kim Parker, associate director of Pew Social & Demographic Trends, noting that people see the wealthy as having both positive and negative attributes. 'The challenge for Romney lies more in the fact that large majorities say if he is elected president, his policies would likely benefit the wealthy.' Open and shut: Chairman of the RNC Reince Priebus gavels the convention to order at the Tampa Bay Times Forum in Tampa, Florida, today. But then it was put into immediate recess because of tropical storm Isaac . According to Pew's latest findings, about 63 per cent of Americans say the GOP favors the rich over the middle class and poor, and 71 per cent say Romney's election would be good for wealthy people. A smaller share, 20 per cent, says the same about the Democratic Party. More Americans - 60 per cent - say if Obama is re-elected his policies will benefit the poor, while half say they'll help the middle class and 37 per cent say they'll boost the wealthy. The poll results reinforce a tide of recent economic data showing a widening economic divide. America's middle class has been shrinking in the stagnant economy and poverty is now approaching 1960s highs, while wealth concentrates at the top. A separate Pew survey earlier this year found that tensions between the rich and poor were increasing and at their most intense level in nearly a quarter-century. Differing views: More Americans say if Obama is re-elected his policies will benefit the poor, while Romney says his policies will benefit the middle class by boosting the economy and creating jobs . In fact, well-off people do shoulder a big share of the tax burden: though households earning over $1million annually comprise just 0.3 per cent of all taxpayers, they  pay 20 per cent of all federal taxes the government is projected to collect this year. By contrast, households earning $50,000 to $75,000 a year accounted for 12 per cent of taxpayers and contributed 9 per cent of federal taxes, the data showed. Some 46 per cent of households pay no federal income tax at all, although they do pay payroll, excise and other taxes. The American income tax system has long been designed to be progressive, meaning higher earners are expected to pay a greater share of their income than those making less. In this year's tax battle in Washington, Obama wants to let the current top rate of 35 per cent for high earners rise to 39.6 per cent next year. Congressional Republicans would reduce the top rate to 25 per cent, while Romney would reduce it to 28 per cent. Romney and GOP lawmakers have said they would eliminate some deductions to pay for the rate reductions, but have not specified which ones.","58 per cent of surveyors for a Pew poll said the rich don't pay enough taxes .

A huge explosion rocked Venezuela's biggest oil refinery early on Saturday, killing at least 24 people and injuring more than 50 others in the deadliest disaster in memory for the country's key oil industry. Balls of fire rose over the Amuay refinery, one of the largest in the world, in video posted on the Internet by people who were nearby at the time. Those killed included a 10-year-old boy, and at least 53 people were injured, Falcon state Gov. Stella Lugo said on state television. She said firefighters had controlled the flames at the refinery on the Paraguana Peninsula in western Venezuela, where large clouds of smoke were rising. Blast: A fire is seen after an explosion at Amuay oil refinery in Punto Fijo, in the Peninsula of Paraguana on Saturday . Raging: A fire burns after the explosion. Officials said 'the blast wave was of a significant magnitude' At least 24 people were killed, many of them National Guard troops stationed at the refinery, Vice President Elias Jaua said on television after traveling to the area. He said the authorities were 'trying to save the greatest number of lives.' Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said that Venezuela has enough fuel supplies to guarantee continued exports and domestic supply. As far as fuel shipments, he said, 'we won't have major effects.' The blast occurred after 1 a.m. when a gas leak created a cloud that ignited, Ramirez said. Some nearby houses were damaged by the blast, he said on television. 'That gas generated a cloud that later exploded and has caused fires in at least two tanks of the refinery and surrounding areas,' Ramirez said. 'The blast wave was of a significant magnitude.' Under control: A column of smoke rises after an explosion at Amuay oil refinery in Punto Fijo, in the Peninsula of Paraguana on Saturday. Officials say the fire is now contained . Wounded: Emergency personnel stand by to ferry the injured to nearby hospitals . Images in state media showed the flames casting an orange glow against the night sky. One photograph showed an injured man being wheeled away on a stretcher. 'The areas that had to be evacuated were evacuated, Lugo said, according to the state-run Venezuelan News Agency. 'The situation is controlled. Of course they're still a fire rising very high, but ... the specialists tell me there is no risk of another explosion.' Ramirez said oil workers will determine what caused the gas leak and were inspecting the damage along with troops. Ramirez said that nine storage tanks were damaged. He said supplies of fuel had been cut off to part of the refinery, and that the fire had been brought under control. Troops were securing the area at the refinery, Lugo said. 'At this time, the situation is controlled,' Jaua said on television, while smoke continued to rise from the refinery. Jaua said earlier on his Twitter account that the military was deployed to the area and that air ambulances were dispatched to ferry the wounded. Amuay is part of the Paraguana Refinery Complex, which also includes the adjacent Cardon refinery. Together, the two refineries process about 900,000 barrels of crude per day and 200,000 barrels of gasoline. Venezuela is a major supplier of oil to the U.S. and a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.","10-year-old boy and National Guard troops among the dead .

They savaged 11-year-old Max so badly he nearly lost an ear and suffered bloody bite marks that had to be treated by a vet. Now the Queen has turned to TV animal behaviourist Dr Roger Mugford who once saved one of Princess Anne's bull terriers from being put down after it attacked two children. Doting: The Queen with her pet corgis who savaged Princess Beatrice's elderly terrier Max at Balmoral . Puppy love: Beatrice with 11-year-old pet dog Max . She wants the 'dog whisperer,' a regular on TV's Britain's Worst Pet, to calm her cherished corgis down. The Queen is reported to be 'very upset ' by the attack earlier this month as a  member of her Balmoral staff walked corgis, Monty, Willow and Holly and her three dorgis – corgis crossed with dachshunds – Cider, Candy and Vulcan. Max has been a treasured companion of 24-year-old, since she got it for Christmas when she was 13. When he disappeared in 2008 from the . family home in Windsor Great Park, the Queen led a search party which . included the Duchess of York and Princess Eugenie. Three weeks later he was found bedraggled and hungry. 'It's ironic that the Queen was very worried . about Max and helped in the search for him, but now her own dogs have . attacked him,'  said a royal source. Dr Mugford believes he has an 'inkling' why the corgis ganged up on the Norfolk Terrier. He said: 'There is a pack mentality . that a group of dogs can develop which means that they regard any . newcomer as a threat that has to be addressed.' Dr Mugford helped out when one of Princess Anne’s bull terriers attacked a corgi so savagely the dog was later put down. He . also testified when she was convicted under the Dangerous Dog Act in . 2002 after another of her bull terriers, Dotty, attacked two children . and he saved the pet from a lethal injection. Expert: Television animal behaviourist Dr Roger Mugford who has been called by the Queen to calm down her corgis . Stan Rawlinson, Britain’s leading expert in canine aggression, believes the cause of the corgis' problem could be a lack of early socialisation with other dogs when they were puppies. He told the Daily Express: 'If you socialise these dogs with other dogs and people they will become well-rounded dogs and you might not get the problem the Queen has.' At the weekend, the Queen walked her pets and even played with a golden Labrador which came bounding up to her.

A mother-of-two has revealed her terror on waking up to find herself swimming in a deep river after she went sleepwalking in the middle of the night. Alyson Bair, 31, suffers from a severe form of the condition which she believes is made worse by stress brought on by the diagnosis of a chronic illness. On August 20, her husband Cody woke at 2am to discover his wife was not in bed and a sliding glass open at the family home in Burley, Idaho. Nightmare scenario: Married mother-of-two Alyson Bair was found on an Idaho riverbank after sleepwalking into a river last week . A frantic search began involving the local sheriff and a neighbor on a jet ski who covered the Snake River close to their home in Cassia County. Five hours later, Mrs Bair was found . on a riverbank a quarter of a mile from home. Her pyjamas were soaking wet and she was suffering . from hypothermia with cuts and bruises on her bare feet. She was . taken to Cassia Regional Medical Center by ambulance and later released. Mrs Bair told ABCNews: 'I thought I was dreaming, but then I realized I wasn't and I was scared. 'It was deep and I couldn't touch anywhere and I was getting tired. I had to keep turning around and floating on my back.' The mother said the sleepwalking terrifies her because she 'doesn't know what she could do'. The . Bairs have a son, eight, and four-year-old daughter. The first time . that she went sleepwalking, it was her son that discovered his mother . was missing. Drifting downstream: Mrs Bair, 31, sleepwalked the quarter mile from her home to Snake River, Idaho and got into the water . Night swimming: Mrs Bair was found lying on bank of Snake River, Idaho after a frantic five-hour search by her husband and local sheriff's department . Medicines and guns at the family home have been locked up and her husband has installed alarms on all outside doors to which she doesn't know the codes. The night she managed to get out, the family had left the doors open because of the hot weather. Mrs Bair has been diagnosed with a . chronic auto-immune disease called Sjogren's syndrome where a person's . white blood cells attack their moisture-producing glands. She . said that the condition has caused her joint pain, fatigue and mild . issues with her kidneys. Although she takes two medications, sleeping . tablets were not one of them. The 31-year-old admitted that since . being told she had Sjogren's syndrome she had felt depressed and doctors . said stress could exacerbate the sleepwalking. Safe: Mrs Bair was found soaking wet in her pyjamas and was suffering from hypothermia. She was taken to Cassia Regional Medical Center, pictured . Mrs Bair has also suffered from night terrors since she was a child which she now takes medication for. She added: 'I haven't been injured seriously besides the hypothermia, thank goodness…I'm just worried about what could happen.' Mrs Bair has a history of sleep swimming - authorities have responded to three incidents in the past six weeks. According to a Cassia County . Sheriff's . report, deputies found her one other time soaking wet . in Burley after apparently swimming in the river. After the latest . incident, a county judge issued an order to have her mental health . checked - but she was not found to be a danger to herself or others. A deputy told the woman's husband she needed to seek help as the temperatures . will soon drop, posing a greater danger. Late night dip: Alyson was found a quarter of a mile from her home after sleep swimming on Snake River, Idaho (pictured) at 2am . Alyson Bair appeared to have been suffering from a particularly severe form of somnambulism, or sleepwalking. It typically occurs when people are in deep sleep early in the night, but does not take place during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is the time when eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming is common. Sleepwalking occurs when normal physiological systems are active when they're not supposed to be. Scientists are still puzzling out why the brain issues commands to muscles during certain sleep phases, but do know the commands are usually suppressed by other brain mechanisms. For some people however, this suppression is not fully recognised - due to genetic or environmental factors. The sleepwalker cannot respond during the incident, even though their eyes are open, and often won't remember it. If they are awoken, they will be disorientated for a short time. The cause is generally unknown, but it is believed to be genetic. Aggravating environmental factors are fatigue, a lack of sleep, fever stress and alcohol or drug use.",Alyson Bair found on Idaho riverbank suffering from hypothermia after going missing at 2am .

Community leaders in Selma, Alabama, are furious over the repair and renovation of a monument to a Confederate general who was the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Kulx Klan. Opponents say Nathan Bedford Forrest was a brutal racist who was a slave trader before the Civil War. During the war, his troops slaughtered 200 black soldiers after they surrendered during the Battle of Fort Pillow. The group Friends of Forrest says the general was a self-made man and a brilliant tactician who defended Selma during the Union invasion in 1865. Scroll down for video . Stolen: In April, someone swiped the bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest. The group Friend of Forrest is spending $50,000 to replace it . Controversy: Forrest was a millionaire slave trader who worked to bring blacks back under white control after the war as a leader of the KKK . 'I'd recommend this man for any young people to model their life after,' Todd Kiscaden, a member of the group, told WSFA. 'He always led from the front.  He did what he said he was going to do.  He took care of his people, and his people included both races.' In April, someone stole the bust of Forrest that was placed at the Confederate memorial in Live Oak Cemetery in Selma. Friends of Forrest offered a $20,000 reward for its return, but aren't waiting for it to be found. They've invested $50,000 to put a new head on the monument and renovate the memorial. Opponents say Forrest is no man to be celebrated. 'Here's a man who killed African-Americans who had surrendered, who were not a threat to anybody, formed the Ku Klux Klan, and yet we are talking about a monument to him,' State Sen Hank Sanders, a Democrat from Selma, told WSFA. 'Role model': Friends of Forrest member Todd Kiscaden says the general should be revered for his brilliant tactics . Before the Civil War broke out, Forrest was one of the richest men in the South. He owned a cotton plantation in Tennessee and untold numbers of slaves. He became so successful at human trafficking, he opened a slave trading business in Memphis. During the war, he became known for his brilliant strategic and tactical skills. In 1864, he led 1,600 Confederate soldiers in an attack on Fort Pillow in Tennessee, which was defended by both black and white Union soldiers. After the soldiers surrendered, Forrest reportedly oversaw the systematic slaughter of some 200 black soldiers, who were singled out for death, while their white comrades were allowed to surrender. Following the end of the war, Forrest joined the KKK, which was founded by former Confederate soldiers who were attempting to bring freed slaves back under white control. He served as the first Grand Wizard, the leader of the vigilante group, as it waged a campaign of terror against blacks and white sympathizers -- murdering and lynching hundreds and beating hundreds more. The Selma city government controls the cemetery where Forrest's memorial sits. However, the city claims that the private group United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the specific plot of land occupied by the Confederate memorial. Selma City Council President Cecil Williamson says the city is powerless to stop the renovation of the monument and he believes government should stay out of the issue.

The majority of comments aimed at Jackson though took exception to him apparently wishing ill-will on an entire city because of a political event being held there. Half an hour later Jackson realised that he might have crossed a line after thousands complained about what he wrote. Just one of the thousands of vitriolic tweets that Jackson received in response to his 'Unfair' tweet. This comment on Twitter mirrors Jackson's famous line in the film Snakes on a Plane . 'Daayum! Poked a Hornets nest, hunh? Apologies to God, Tampa, da GOP& Isaac(sp)! Who played the Race card?!' wrote Jackson. Despite his back-track, it seems that his repeated mentions of God and Tampa sparked more ire from Twitter users. 'Whoooo! A lotta s**t stirred into a Bulls**t tweet! Politics & Religion get MUHFREPUBLICANS heated!' remarked Jackson as he got creative with his favourite expletive. The actor then tried to put the storm behind him by tweeting very uncontroversial advice: 'Seriously, leave the path of Danger if you're asked. Be safe & be Smart wherever you are & whatever your Politics!' Ellen Barkin in May of 2012 in New York City: The actress re-tweeted a post which seemed to indicated she would be happy for Republican's to drown during Tropical Storm Isaac . Samuel L. Jackson's support for President Obama is no secret, with the veteran Hollywood actor declaring in the March issue of Ebony magazine that he voted for Mr. Obama 'because he was black.' 'Cuz that's why other folks vote for other people - because they look like them,' said Jackson to the magazine. And in October, Jackson expressed his view that the Tea Party was racist by saying, 'It's not politics. It is not economics. It all boils down pretty much to race. It is a shame,' said Jackson to New York Magazine. Jackson's comments follow on from the actress Ellen Barkin, who said she hoped Republicans would be drowned by Hurricane Isaac. The violent storm, which made landfall in Louisana on Tuesday night, was previously feared to be heading for the GOP convention in Tampa, Florida. And sitcom star Ellen Barkin caused . controversy when she appeared to endorse a tweet saying that the . delegates should be swept 'right into the ocean'. On . Monday afternoon, Ms Barkin retweeted a message sent to her by another . user saying: 'C'mon #Isaac!

Isaac's large reach is seen by its eastern cloud cover over the Gulf of Mexico. The storm side-swiped the Republican National Convention in Tampa on Monday . Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann Romney wave to the delegation at the second day of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida . The first day of the Republican National Convention was cancelled due to the threat posed by Isaac, which has brought high winds and storms to the entire Gulf region. Ms Barkin has also drawn opposition with a series of anti-Mormon messages, as well as joking about the death of conservative pundit Andrew Breitbart.","The popular actor and outspoken supporter of President Obama caused controversy by saying that it was unfair that Tampa, Florida escaped the direct path of Isaac and New Orleans did not .

A French Paralympics official has claimed the British team is guilty of ‘technological doping’ by spending hundreds of thousands of pounds developing cutting-edge wheelchairs that give a significant advantage over poorer countries. Rudy Van Abeele, the French Paralympic team’s deputy manager, said ParalympicsGB’s investment in state-of-the-art equipment was turning the event into the equivalent of Formula 1. He even said Britain’s double gold winning track wheelchair racer David Weir would not have reached the finals of his events without his innovative chair. The French Paralympic Team arrive in London. Rudy Van Abeele, the French Paralympic team’s deputy manager has criticised the British team . His comments echoed French complaints at the Olympics, when cycling team director Isabelle Gautheron pointed an accusing finger at the British and their ‘magic wheels’. And Jamaica joined in the new row, claiming it had not entered a single track wheelchair racer because of the costs involved. Mr Van Abeele said: ‘The Paralympics is becoming like Formula 1. For me the wheelchair is at least 25 per cent of the performance and Britain has the most advanced technology. ‘It’s technological doping because it is not available for everybody.’ Asked how British world record holder David Weir would have fared in a wheelchair used by a poorer country, Mr Van Abeele said: ‘He would not even be in the final. The wheelchair’s balance is built for him. ‘The cost is around £5,000 to £7,000. Those amounts for some people are more than they can get in their lives. It’s very sad.’ Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed UK Sport had spent £700,000 on research and innovation. To assess aerodynamic efficiency, wheelchairs have been blasted with air in wind tunnels built by defence firm BAE Systems and used to develop the Eurofighter Typhoon jet. Manoeuvrability has been measured using cutting-edge tracking technology developed by Formula 1 team McLaren, while the seats have been created by car firm BMW. Asked how British . David Weir (pictured) would have fared in a wheelchair used by a poorer country, Mr . Van Abeele said: ‘He would not even be in the final . One argument for Paralympic teams being allowed unlimited investment is that the technology can later be adapted to help disabled people in the real world. However, Mr Van Abeele said that the equipment being used by the British was so personalised that it was difficult for rival competitors to use it, let alone disabled people in everyday life. The Secretary-General of the Jamaican Paralympic Committee, Suzanne Harris-Henry, said the high cost of competitive chairs had priced the Jamaican team out of entering the wheelchair events. ‘There is no point taking part if you don’t have the money to buy a good enough wheelchair,’ she said. ‘The cheapest ones cost £2,200 which we cannot afford.’ A British Paralympic Association spokesman said: ‘Our job, backed by funding from the lottery and commercial sponsors, is to make our athletes the best prepared to compete and win on the world stage, cleanly and fairly. 'We are aware that in the UK we are lucky with our funding and have a world-renowned science and engineering sector.’",The French Paralympic team deputy boss said Brits investment was turning the event 'into Forumla 1'

It's every gambler's dream - landing the jackpot because a casino dealer forgets to shuffle the cards. And it happened for a group of lucky mini-baccarat players in April who will walk away with around $1.5 million after winning a controversial lawsuit over their claim to the cash. 14 players cashed in more than $550,000 in chips, but the Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City was refusing to pay off the remaining $1 million. Gambling mecca: The game took place at the Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey . They found themselves embroiled in a court battle with casino chiefs following their impossibly lucky night on the table. Back in April the 14 players stuck lucky when they realised that the cards weren't being shuffled properly, leading to the same sequence of cards was being dished out. They took advantage of the oversight, which went unnoticed by casino staffers, and slowly increased their bets over 41 consecutive winning hands. On a roll: The group won 41 consecutive hands on a mini-baccarat table (stock image) Casino bosses filed a lawsuit against the players, argued that the rogue deck gave them an unfair advantage, which they strongly disputed. 'I wasn’t cheating,' one of the gamblers, 51-year-old Michael Cho told the Washington Post. 'I didn’t do anything illegal. It wasn’t right for them to get the money. 'Anybody could see [that the cards weren't shuffled] — that was the dream we all look for. We took a chance on every hand we bet, that it wouldn’t change. 'We didn’t know if it was going to change. That’s called gambling.' udge James Isman sided with the players, ruling that it was the Golden Nugget's responsibility to ensure the cards were properly shuffled. 'There is no clear and convincing, real evidence that there were unlawful actions,' he said. Acceptance: Tilman Fertitta, owner of the Golden Nugget Atlantic City, said he will not appeal the court ruling . 'I don’t consider this to be a rigged game. There is no proof that the players obtained those chips unlawfully.' The ruling provoked an angry response from the casino but owner and billionaire Tilman Fertitta said he will not take the case any further. 'Without question, the mini-baccarat game that took place on April 30, 2012, allowed $10 bettors to realize a gambler’s dream and enabled them to beat the house out of $1.5 million.' 'Even though we can appeal the court’s ruling and take full advantage of the appellate process and legal system, and tie the matter up in litigation for a number of years, the Golden Nugget is a people business. 'It is prepared to allow the gamblers — most of whom continue to gamble at Golden Nugget — to realize the gambler’s dream of beating the house.'","14 gamblers struck lucky on the mini-baccarat table in April at the Golden Nugget casino .

A woman who fell 1,000ft to her death during a freak hang gliding accent wasn't strapped into the glider when she took off with her instructor, an investigation has revealed. The pilot of 27-year-old Lenami Godinez-Avila was found distracted prior to their jump in British Colombia, Canada and consequently failed to perform a hang glider check prior to her death last spring, according to investigators. '[T]he investigation assumes that pilot distraction resulted in a failure to perform recommended standardized safety procedures, resulting in the death of the passenger,' Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association of Canada (HPAC) Investigator Martin Henry told the Calgary Herald. Scroll down for video . Victim: Lenami Godinez-Avila, 27, died in April after a freak hang gliding accident investigators say resulted from her pilot failing to strap her in . Charged: Hang glider pilot Jon Orders, since released on bail, faces a charge of attempted obstruction after swallowing a video card capturing the trip which police have since obtained . It was approximately 30 seconds after Ms Godinez-Avila and pilot William Jonathan Orders, 50, took off near Agassiz on April 28 that she fell. It was to be her first hang gliding experience with her boyfriend who witnessed her fall while desperately calling out to her: 'Hang on! I love you!' Her boyfriend David, whom she was celebrating an anniversary with, was riding with a separate pilot when it happened. 'A review of the events leading up to take-off suggests that there were multiple distractions that may have resulted in a breakdown of standard operating procedures,' the HPAC report read. Scene: Hang gliders and emergency workers rush to where Lenami Godinez-Avila's body was found after she plummeted 1,000 feet to her death in what was her first hang gliding experience . Tragic end: The 27-year-old was able to hang on for just 30 seconds before losing her grip and falling . None of the seven witnesses interviewed saw her undergo a hang check. Nicole McLearn who was there the day Lenami died said the couple were 'joyous' as they watched the other hang gliders take to the air, growing excited about their turn. She told the Post Media News that as soon as she and instructor William Jonathan Orders became airbound, it was clear something was wrong. She said: 'I could see her starting to slip down his body ... past the waist, down . the legs. Finally she got to the feet and tried to hang on and . obviously couldn't hang on for that much longer and let go, tearing off . the tandem pilot's shoes in the process.' Distracted: Police investigating the death of Lenami, left, say the pilot, right, was distracted before their flight, causing him to miss administrating all safety procedures . Usually an instructor and the student . should be side by side, but Lenami was below him and it became obvious . she was not hooked in. Miss McLearn said it . appeared that Godinez-Avila’s feet were dangling, meaning she was . relying on her upper body to hold on and the instructor was trying to . wrap his legs around her torso. She was only in the air about 30 seconds before she died. At the launch site, her boyfriend watched what was happening and screamed as she fell: 'No! Lenami! Hang on! I love you!' Orders was held in custody following an admittance to police that he swallowed a video card which may have recorded events leading up to the incident. Swallowed: A flash drive, similar to the one pulled out of one of the pilot's cameras is seen, left, in comparison to older cameras' much larger sizes, right . Witness: Nicole McLearn said it became obvious as soon as they took off that something was not right as the instructor was horizontal and Lenami was hanging vertical . The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they have since obtained the card, described as no bigger than a finger nail in size, but wouldn't comment on the evidence collected from it. They also said they seized video taken by the boyfriend on the ground. Orders was granted bail when he appeared in a provincial court in Chilliwack, British Columbia in May. A trial is set for April of 2013 on a charge of attempted obstruction. Orders is a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor with 16 years' experience. His . business website, Vancouver Hang Gliding, states that photos and video . are available when people purchase a tandem hang-gliding trip. Search for clues: Police examined the hang-glider after the body of Miss Godinez-Avila was found . Investigation: Police say they have reviewed the footage stored on the video card ingested by the pilot but have yet to release comment on their findings . The young woman's body was found in a forest clear cut below Mount Woodside, a popular spot for hang gliders to launch from above British Columbia's Fraser Valley. Jason Warner, safety officer for the Hang Gliders and Paragliders Association of Canada, said that he spoke to Orders minutes after Godinez-Avila fell from the glider. Accused: Orders, a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor had 16 years' experience . Mr Warner said Orders told him he knew something was wrong almost immediately and tried desperately to hang on to the woman, who clung to his body and then slipped down his legs, taking one of Orders' shoes with her. Miss Godinez-Avila, who was an . administrator at the provincial Ministry of Environment, went hang . gliding after her boyfriend bought her lessons for their anniversary. He was video-recording the flight, but had stopped taping before she fell. Friends of Miss Godinez-Avila have set up a memorial fund and scholarship to remember her. One friend, Katherine Louman-Gardiner, told CTV News: 'She was a bright and caring, charismatic person and we miss her terribly. 'She loved contributing to the community around her.' Miss Godinez-Avila's former professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, Anil Hira, paid tribute to her. 'She was just starting out, she was extremely successful, someone who walks on air, very light-hearted but extremely capable. 'It's the last person you would want to see this happen to.' The woman's death marks the second high-profile fatality related to hang gliding in recent months.

Seduced a schoolboy: Rachel Peters, 40, became Facebook friends with the teenager before having sex with him and sending sexual messages online . A ‘predatory’ teaching assistant who seduced a schoolboy of 13 and had sex with him in a field was jailed for three years and three months yesterday. Rachel Peters, 40, targeted the teenager despite being given a warning the previous year for inappropriate conduct with another pupil and having a daughter of a similar age. A respected member of staff at the school, Peters broke the rules by speaking to pupils over the internet on Facebook and MSN instant messaging service, Doncaster Crown Court was told. After initially refusing to become the 13-year-old’s Facebook friend, the pair began exchanging emails. Prosecuting, Kath Goddard said: ‘It involved discussion of sexual matters.’ When talking to the teenager over a webcam one evening, Peters pulled open her dressing gown to expose her breasts to him. A few days later she picked him up from school and ‘made it clear she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him,’ Miss Goddard said. They drove to a rural area where she performed a sex act on him in the car and she then took him to a field where they had sex, the court was told. The pair continued to meet outside school in the evenings and send sexual messages over the internet. The boy told police he ended the relationship after becoming worried when Peters started talking about running away together the court heard. Their affair came to light following a school trip when the boy was overheard chatting to a friend and admitted to a member of staff he had sex with ‘somebody called Rachel’. The school called in the police in September 2010 and Peters was arrested. Peters lied to police, claiming she was trying to help the boy because he was being bullied at school and had not had sex with him. But detectives found a large number . of texts and incriminating messages on her computer between her and the . boy, as well as a boy aged 17. Peters, . of Edlington, Doncaster, was due to stand trial on 10 offences but . after a jury had been sworn in she changed her plea to guilty on three . offences. She was convicted . of engaging in sexual activity in the boy’s presence and two charges of . causing or inciting the boy to engage in sexual activity. All three offences took place between January and September 2010. The other offences were left to lie on the file. Peters was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register. Passing . sentence, Judge Jacqueline Davies said Peters had tried to gain the . boy’s sympathy by lying to him and claiming that her former partner was . terminally ill. It is not clear whether or not Peters is still with her . partner. Over the web: She exposed her breasts to the boy over a webcam before picking him up from school, performing a sex act on the 13-year-old in the car and having sex with him in a field . Reports concluded she posed a serious risk to teenage boys and her behaviour was ‘predatory’. The judge told her: ‘As a mother of a daughter of a similar age I would hope you would appreciate the wrongness of this offence. ‘You were not naive, you have been a teaching assistant for 17 years and have been reprimanded for your conduct in the past.’ Steven Crossley, defending, said Peters had expressed ‘genuine contrition and remorse.’ Remorse: In Doncaster Crown Court, Steven Crossley, defending, said Peters had expressed 'genuine contrition and remorse'","Rachel Peters, 40, became Facebook friends with a 13-year-old boy before picking him up from school .

Tragic accident: Lance Corporal Christopher Roney was killed in Afghanistan when they mistakenly believed he and others were the enemy . A British soldier was killed in Afghanistan after being shot by a US Apache helicopter which wrongly identified his base as an enemy stronghold in a 'tragic accident', an inquest heard. Lance Corporal Christopher Roney, 23, of 3rd Battalion The Rifles, died from head injuries at Patrol Base Almas, in Sangin, Helmand, in December 2009. The base had come under attack from insurgents and the platoon based there were busy fighting them off when air support was called in, Sunderland Coroner Derek Winter said. A drone fitted with a camera and two US Apaches flew to the patrol base, which was a compound with mud walls, bought from a local owner some weeks before and was not on official maps. British troops on the ground, who by this stage had won a firefight against their attackers, were incorrectly identified as the enemy and were hit by 30mm chain gun rounds. Mr Winter, the Sunderland Coroner, said 200 rounds were fired before the mistake was spotted, leaving 11 injured on the ground. L/Cpl Roney, a married former drayman, received emergency treatment but died from his injuries the next day. Captain Palmer Winstanley, commanding . L/Cpl Roney's platoon, said that night insurgents set off a large bomb . and launched an attack with small arms fire. He told the inquest his men managed to repel the attackers. 'We were pretty much winning the . firefight which means we pushed them back to a safe distance and . hopefully they were going to move off into the night,' he said. Then the base came under heavy attack from what he later realised were Apaches. 'It was like nothing I have ever experienced before and I tried to establish what it could be,' he said. At first he believed the explosions . and shrapnel were caused by enemy rocket-propelled grenades fired from . 800m and exploding in the air above them. He also wondered if the enemy had breached the compound defences in the dark. He did not know how long the Apache attack lasted or how many passes the helicopters made. Men were injured, a communication mast destroyed and the picture became confused as he was unaware any Apaches were in the area. He said at around the same time, his men and staff at HQ realised the US attack helicopters were to blame. Meanwhile, the enemy, who had been . moving away, saw what happened and came back to renew the assault and . got to within 30m of the base. A 500lb bomb was dropped on a compound the insurgents were using to launch fire on Almas, and their raid ended. Asked by William Roney, the soldier's . brother, if the Apache's presence was needed, Captain Winstanley . replied: 'We could have won the firefight ... As we were, we were OK.' Heartbroken: Mourners dressed in Sunderland football strips paid their last respects to L/Cpl Chris Roney when his body arrived at Wootton Bassett . Picture of misery: The coffins of three dead British soldiers, including Chris Roney, were greeted by hundreds of mourners as their hearses went through Wootton Bassett in 2009 . When his body was brought back to Britain, hundreds of mourners turned out on the . streets of Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, to pay their respects. A . group of the father-of-one's grief-stricken relatives and friends - . including his wife Lorna - made the long journey from the North East to . honour the fallen hero. Some wore the red-and-white stripes of L/Cpl Roney's beloved home . town football club Sunderland and clutched Union Flags emblazoned with . his name. Mr Winter said the mistaken view that the British base was an insurgents’ compound was shared with key personnel. This was despite the patrol base, 3km from Forward Operating Base Jackson, having a flagpole, a washing line, defensive constructions and personnel who were not dressed like the enemy, Mr Winter said. He was summarising the evidence he expected to hear during the week-long inquest. Statements have been given from the US pilots and co-pilots which will be read later. Retired Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas Kitson, who watched live pictures of the attack, said it was a 'tragic incident'. In his opening statement, Mr Winter said throughout the incident the US Apache helicopter crews were not informed, nor did they ask for the exact location of Patrol Base Almas. He said: 'As a consequence, they were unaware that the compound they were observing and in which they believed they had positively identified insurgents was, in fact Patrol Base Almas.' He described how, with 'total disorientation' now in place, the Apaches were authorised to engage. 'Fused by the overwhelming belief that Patrol Base Almas was at risk of being overrun, the subsequent reactions and actions to these events created a devastating cumulative effect', he said. Mr Winter said that due to the involvement of the US Apache helicopters, the number of personnel and the different locations, the sequence of events that unfolded was highly complex. Fatal: An Apache helicopter, like this one, opened fire and killed the tragic soldier . As a result, he said he would consider all that was visible in the context of a base that was not on the map. He also stated he would take into consideration the 'cumulative human factor elements in this tragic incident' as well as any lessons learnt. In his evidence, Lt Col Kitson said the base at Almas was one of the hardest for the army to defend. 'By the end of the tour, Almas still remained the trickiest as we had limited vehicle access', he said. 'There was very rudimentary defences, such as three layers of barbed wire. 'There was also no printed mapping that had it marked on it.' He said that on the camera picture he was watching of the attack it was impossible to identify those on screen. He said: 'We could see black blobs running around but its just a blob. 'There's no way at that distance of identifying the people. 'I could see muzzle flashes and projectiles being launched but I was the victim of my own assumptions.' He said when it dawned on them what had happened the command was given to 'check fire'. 'The operations room was very busy and it was a pretty frenetic environment', he said. He said six deaths had already occurred that week and there was a general nervousness about Patrol Base Almas. Concluding his evidence, he expressed his regret at what happened. He said: 'I want to record my considerable amount of regret and there's not one of us that cannot think of something we might have done differently.' Lt Col Kitson said Patrol Base Almas was set up to halt activity in what had become a 'no-go area' known as the Taliban Playground. The inquest continues.

Cycling champion Jody Cundy was sensationally disqualified from racing for gold yesterday. There were gasps and boos in the velodrome after officials ruled that the Paralympian, who has won seven gold medals for Britain, was guilty of a false start and would not be allowed to try again. In an extraordinary outburst, a distraught Cundy shouted at officials, telling them they were ‘ruining my life’. He was still yelling as he was dragged from the velodrome by a coach. The decision outraged the 6,000 spectators packed into the velodrome and triggered a furious reaction on Twitter. It . also overshadowed another day of spectacular British cycling success, . with Mark Colbourne winning gold, Jon-Allan Butterworth, Aileen McGlynn, . and Shaun McKeown individual silvers, and Darren Kenny bronze. Cundy’s back wheel had spun crazily as he exited the start gates in the . C4-C5 1km time trial and he put his hand up to signify a false start, . assuming he would be able to start again. But officials raised the red . flag and refused to review the incident on TV monitors.

If looks could kill: His face a picture of hurt and rage, breathing heavily Cundy has to be calmed down by a team member . After smashing a world record and winning silver on day one, Welsh flyer Mark Colbourne has gone one better, winning gold. The cyclist’s feat in the 3km pursuit also set another Paralympics record. He became the first British Paralympian to win a medal when he came second in the 1km time trial. Colbourne, 42, dedicated his gold medal to his late father Cecil, who died earlier this year. ‘I had this dream two years ago along with Neil Smith (his trainer). And fair play to Neil. He said keep working hard and your dream will become a reality,’ Colbourne said. ‘I’m dedicating this win to my later father and mother obviously. I’m surprised I couldn’t hear her shouting among everyone else.’ Just three years ago his life was . changed after breaking his back in a paragliding accident. He underwent . five months of physiotherapy just to learn to walk again. Colbourne . represented Wales in volleyball from 1990-1993 and went on to compete . in the Welsh indoor adaptive rowing championships. In September 2009 he . set himself a target of competing in his first para-cycling event and . went on to win two gold medals at the Wales Grand Prix in Newport. He was then joined the GB para-cycling team in June last year. Speaking after his silver win on day one, he recalled the days after his accident, saying: ‘My future was very uncertain. I didn’t even know if I would ever walk again due to the damage that had been caused to my spine. ‘It was a very slow and worrying time for me and my family. You can imagine the phone call my mother had on the day I didn’t come home.’ The former sales consultant, from Tredegar in south Wales, spent four months in a bed at Cardiff’s Rookwood Hospital, graduating to physiotherapy and then walking frames. These improvements lifted his spirits but it was meeting Anthony Hughes of Disability Sport Wales (DSW) that changed his life. He said: ‘I realised there were opportunities for people like me who’d had terrible accidents or had severe illnesses. ‘The worst thing in the world is when you’ve had something taken away from you and you have no control over it. It’s difficult to focus on anything positive. I tried rowing, shooting and cycling, anything at all to take my mind off this disability that wasn’t going to change.’ Although he had no movement in his feet, hamstrings or glutes (buttock muscles), he found that the nerve damage did not extend to his quadriceps, meaning he could ride a bike. On leaving Rookwood Hospital, Colbourne started training with the DSW Academy para-cycling squad under the guidance of coach Neil Smith and in May 2010 debuted in a track race, the Wales Grand Prix. ‘I felt at that point I was returning back to society. I thought it would be a good idea to take up something to stop me from sitting in the house all day. I had to work to get the muscle memory back and start training like an athlete. It was slow. ‘I owe such a lot to the DSW team and to Neil. They gave me my life back. I get a massive buzz from cycling because when I’m walking with my crutches I do feel disabled. However, when I’m on the bike I do feel able-bodied again. So it’s a great feeling that I look forward to every day.’ His dedication clearly paid off as he took his podium place at the Paralympics.","Amputee fell out of the gate at start of 1km time trial race .

A 29-year-old was the victim of a bomb hoax on Thursday, after a mystery caller, thought to be an angry ex-girlfriend, tipped off police that he had taken explosives on an airplane. The anonymous caller claimed Christopher Shell was carrying 'dangerous substances' on board a US Airways Philadelphia-Dallas flight forcing it to make a u-turn mid-air. At first believed to be a birthday prank, police and the airline took the allegation seriously and re-routed the plane, sending it back to Philadelphia International Airport, half an hour into the journey. Scroll down for video . Victim? Police said Christopher Shell (pictured) is not considered to be a suspect . Emergency u-turn: Christopher Shell was removed from the craft while it was searched . Airport police received the bomb-scare call at around 7.30am claiming Shell was on his way to Texas, carrying a dangerous substance, and contacted the FBI. The plane returned to Philadelphia where it was met by a slew of law enforcement vehicles and personnel. Shell was led from the jet wearing . handcuffs after the craft made its emergency return to Philadelphia . International Airport on Thursday morning. He was put him in the back of a police car and taken off for questioning, apparently very surprised to be caught up in the midst of the emergency. 'He was obviously very alarmed, as I would be if heavily armed police officers entered a plane to take me off,' Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Joseph . Sullivan said. Brag: Christopher Shell quickly recovered from his shock to offer up his story in exchange for cash . Rant: Shell moaned about the flight on Facebook . 'And he was certainly stunned. And that's why this is no joke, this is no laughing matter.' Bomb technicians and specially trained dogs searched the plane but found nothing illegal or hazardous, Sullivan said. Police believe the scare was a practical joke, played on Shell as he celebrated his 29th birthday, NBC reported. Shell did nothing wrong and was the victim of 'a pretty nasty trick,' Sullivan said. He made a swift recovery, however, taking to Facebook to offer up his story in exchange for cash. 'If u have questions or want an interview with me, it will cost u $$$ until then,' he wrote. 'Sry. Message me your offers as I'll go with the most $$$!' Earlier on he had posted: 'Im not going to lie, I'm pretty disappointed in US Airways currently.

Briefing: Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan talks about the threat after its investigation by police . Sullivan stressed that Shell is not a suspect but added that police are treating the hoax seriously because it had resulted in a heavy police response and a significant hassle for all those on board, he said. 'It's just an incredibly foolish and irresponsible thing to do and, bottom line, it's criminal,' Sullivan said. Two people have since been taken into custody for questioning, according to NBC. Earlier, an FBI spokesman said the flight was diverted because of a call reporting liquid explosives were on board. Sullivan declined to discuss the content of the call. The airplane had 69 passengers and five crew members on board, airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. Sullivan said the investigation into the phone call had been turned over to the FBI.

Convicted: The father, whose face MailOnline has muzzed out to protect the identity of his daughter, was sentenced to six years . A young woman who was forced to live with a polygamous clan in Utah throughout her childhood thought she found reprieve when she was adopted by a Washington man. However, rather than help her recover from her traumatic experience, her adopted father repeatedly raped and molested her. The father, 42, who lives in Snohomish, Washington, was sentenced to six years in prison after being convicted of several charges of rape and incest in June. The girl, identified in court papers only as AJ, grew up in the polygamous commune in Utah.  According to the affidavit obtained by MailOnline, AJ suffered 'physical and emotional abuse to such a degree that she would later be diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.' She was placed in foster care at the age of 12 after she was taken away from her birth parents at the clan. In 2006, AJ was adopted by her new parents, whose names MailOnline has not released in order to protect the victim's identity. After the adoption was complete, the new family moved from Utah to Snohomish. According to the Everett Herald, a therapist encouraged the family – including the girl’s adoptive father and mother – to explore ‘attachment therapy' to help AJ recover from the emotionally damaging years at the clan. The therapist recommended that the father, mother, and AJ– who was now 15 – fall asleep in the same bed as a means of bonding. Within a month of seeing the therapist, AJ's father began sexually assaulting her, oftentimes when his wife was asleep in the same bed. Sentenced: An adoptive father in Washington was sentenced to six years in prison for the rape and molestation of his adopted daughter . In a written statement, AJ said: 'When (my mother) was asleep, (my father) began touching me. We were all in the same bed.' She then described in graphic detail how her father would sexually assault her while her mother slept. Court documents state that AJ's mother was unaware of the incestual rape. Indeed, AJ's father would often side with his daughter when she was having arguments with her mother as a means of control and alienation. Presided: Snohomish County Superior Court Judge Ellen J. Fair, pictured, sentenced the father . Authorities are also continuing an investigation against the therapist, who made the recommendation for the adoptive parents to ‘bond’ with their daughter. The recommendation stemmed from the therapist’s perception that she had abandonment issues, as well as problems with attachment. The victim said that her father coerced her into . sex at least every week, saying there would be dire consequences if she refused. He told her that if she stopped having sex with him, he would reverse the adoption and ship her back to the polygamous community in Utah, adding that she would be forced to marry into the group upon her return. He also told her that he would kill himself, court documents stated. And so the raping and molestation continued, often when his wife was not around. During one incident, he was performing oral sex on her in her younger sister's bedroom. AJ told prosecutors that her sister told him that she was hungry. At that point, AJ said, her father said 'he was busy' and started having sex with her. She told the court that the abuse continued until she left for college in 2010. The young woman reported the abuse to her former psychotherapist in March 2011; she reported it to the police months later. Place of residence: The man and his wife live in Snohomish, Washington . In December 2011, investigators obtained judicial authorization to record telephone conversations between AJ and her father. When she confronted him about the years of sexual abuse, her father said: 'I understand where you are coming from, I can't argue with what you said.' In that same conversation recorded by investigators, he said to AJ: 'I took your trust. I took advantage of your love for me.' During the trial this week, the girl asked for her adoptive father and rapist to be put away as long as possible so she could heal and get stronger before she would have to run into him again. 'The best thing is a life well-lived in spite of everything you’ve had to endure up to this point.' -Superior Judge Ellen Fair . Superior Court Judge Ellen Fair sentenced him to six years in prison. Initially, the father’s defence requested a Special Sexual Offender Sentencing Alternative. If that had been approved, the father would have only been sent to prison for a year. He would have had to undergo intensive treatment and be regularly supervised by the Department of Corrections in Washington state. However, Judge Fair sided with the victim, citing the obligation of the law to follow her wishes. She dubbed the special sentencing ‘too lenient.’ In total, the father was charged with incest, rape of a child in the third degree, and two counts of child molestation. According to the Herald, he apologised to her in court while the victim wiped away tears. The judge told her: ‘The best thing is a life well-lived in spite of everything you’ve had to endure up to this point.’","Girl was molested by birth parents for years in polygamous Utah group .

The virus starts out causing flu-like symptoms, including headache, fever, muscle ache, shortness of breath and cough, and can lead to severe breathing difficulties and death. The incubation period for the virus is typically two to four weeks after exposure, the CDC said, with a range between a few days and six weeks. Just over a third of cases are fatal. 'Providers are reminded to consider the diagnosis of HPS in all persons presenting with clinically compatible illness and to ask about potential rodent exposure or if they had recently visited Yosemite National Park,' the CDC said. Spreading: Park officials have since been busy spreading the word to park goers, as well as those who previously visited, with one one seen handing information on the virus here . Symptoms: Pamphlets on the virus are seen with its flu-like symptoms including headache, fever, muscle ache, shortness of breath and cough . Although there is no cure for hantavirus, which has never been known to be transmitted between humans, treatment after early detection through blood tests can save lives. 'Early medical attention and diagnosis of hantavirus are critical,' Yosemite superintendent Don Neubacher said in a statement. 'We urge anyone who may have been exposed to the infection to see their doctor at the first sign of symptoms and to advise them of the potential of hantavirus.' Yosemite spokeswoman Kari Cobb said rangers have answered some 1,500 phone calls from park visitors and others concerned about the disease. But she said the outbreak had not triggered a wave of cancellations. 'Right now it's normal numbers for Friday,' she said. 'There have been cancellations, but it would be grossly overstated to say they're cancelling en masse. There's quite a bit of people out there still. It's still summer and a holiday weekend. It's still the summer crowds.' Attraction: The western Sierra Nevada mountains of California are seen in the park where up to 10,000 people who stayed in the lodging cabins may have been exposed to the virus . A national park service officials has said that public health officials warned the park twice before about hantavirus after it struck visitors. But it was not until this week that the hiding place for the deer mice carrying the virus was found. Hantavirus is carried in rodent feces, urine and saliva, which dries out and mixes with dust that can be inhaled by humans, especially in small, confined spaces with poor ventilation. People can also be infected by eating contaminated food, touching contaminated surfaces or being bitten by infected rodents.

Convicted: Gary Swierski was sentenced to 25 years in jail for the murder of his second wife, but now he may have an earlier crime to deal with . A man who was convicted of killing his mail order bride may have gotten away with the murder of a previous girlfriend, it was revealed today. Gary Swierski was sentenced to 25 years in prison after his daughter Eva testified that her father strangled his second wife Reina and forced her to help him hide the body in a California national park. Now California police are calling on authorities in Swierski's old hometown of Goshen, New York to reopen the investigation into his former girlfriend Hilda Gonzalez-Tapia Muhammad who 'drowned'. The San Jose Mercury News reports that during his trial, Swierski's history of abuse came to light, and apparently that extended back to both of his wives and former girlfriends. Swierski's turbulent romantic history dates back to when he began a pen pal relationship with Mansueta Casinillo who eventually moved from the Philippines to New York in 1981 to marry him and have his child, Eva. During his recent trial, Ms Casinillo told the court that she was abused repeatedly during her marriage to Swierski. At one point, she wrote to her sister in the Philippines saying that if she went missing, her husband would be the reason. In 1992, Ms Casinillo took Eva - who was also abused by Swierski - and fled to California. He stayed behind and began dating Ms Muhammad, a Chilean woman who died two months after they moved in together. The circumstances surrounding her death, though formally ruled a drowning, were suspicious to one local detective but Swierski filed a complaint about that officer and he was removed from the case. 'There were a lot of red flags,' Lieutenant Craig Anderson, one of the investigators, told The Mercury News. 'One of the original officers, I learned secondhand, was highly suspicious. But Swierski complained about him, and the officer was ultimately told to drop it.' Not for swimming: Swierski's ex girlfriend Hilda Gonzalez-Tapia Muhammad was found having 'drowned' in Basha Kill Wildlife Management Area in Wurtsboro, New York back in 1993 . Date night: The then-couple who had been living together for two months, went to dinner at Red Lobster (like the one seen here in neighboring Middletown) before going to the wildlife area that is not normally used for swimming . On the night of her death, Ms Muhammad and Swierski had dinner at a local Red Lobster before they went to the Basha Kill Wildlife Management Area, which is not typically used for swimming. The fact that Ms Muhammad, who worked at a local university, was a champion swimmer, was found wearing a purple jumpsuit and shoes, had abrasions to her face consistent with being smothered, and torn clothing near her pelvis suggesting possible unwanted intercourse were overlooked by investigators. As was the fact that she only eight feet away from shallow water. In spite of the clues that suggest another reason for her death, it was ruled a drowning. Known victim: Reina Swierski was killed in 2005 but her husband wasn't arrested until 2001 after his stepdaughter confessed to helping him hide the body . According to Swierski's criminal record, and The Mercury News, his string of domestic abuse didn't end there. Shortly after Ms Muhammad's death, he moved to California and began dating Elizabeth Armijo, an immigrant from Bolivia who worked at Burger King. She left him in 1996 immediately after he hit her and strangled her to the point where she almost lost consciousness. To cover his bases, he reported Ms Armijo to police because she was in the country illegally, and she was deported. The crime that sent him to jail, however, was from the relationship that followed when he began another pen pal relationship with Reina who went on to be his second wife. The first break in the Reina's case came in April of 2008 – three years after she had gone missing – when her skull was found by hikers in Castle Rock State Park near Boulder Creek. Her identity remained a mystery until 2010 when a DNA profile and dental records showed that the skull matched that of the missing woman, according to the Examiner.com. Then in 2011, Eva Swierski, his daughter from his first marriage who was then 26-years-old, walked into a police station and said that her father had strangled her stepmother and ordered her to help remove the body from their home. Miss Swierski explained her decision to come forward with information about the murder by saying that she ‘could no longer live with the guilt,’ prosecutors said. She was also apparently being threatened by her father to keep quiet. During her father’s two-and-a-half-week trial, Eva Swierski testified against him and was not charged in the case. ‘It took a lot of courage and strength for her to come forward,’ said Deputy District Attorney Matt Braker. Confirmed scene: Swierski dumped the body of his second wife Reina in the Santa Cruz Mountains . In often emotional testimony, Swierski said that as a 19-year-old, she got a call from her father shortly before midnight on March 8, 2005, asking for her help. When she arrived at the house, Swierski told her that he had choked his wife to death and she was lying dead in an upstairs bathtub. He needed his daughter’s assistance in getting her out of the house and burying her. The 26-year-old said she had agreed to . carry the body, but refused to inter it. Instead, she remained inside . her father’s Honda while he disposed of his wife in the Santa Cruz . Mountains. The jury did not . believe Swierski’s line of defense that he killed his wife accidentally . and in self-defense when she allegedly attacked him with knife, . prosecutors said. It took the jury only one day of deliberations to convict Mr Swierski. In . the course of the trial, witnesses testified that Reina Swierski was . abused so severely at the hands of her husband that friends smuggled her . from her house, hidden under a blanket in the back seat of a car. Neighbors . told the jury about Mrs Swierski ‘running to their home in the middle . of the night, shaking like a mouse with bruises on her throat, saying he . tried to kill her,’ Braker told the San Jose Mercury. Miss . Swierski said she too was subjected to abuse at the hands of her . father, although Braker said his star witnesses told him she still loves . her dad. Confession: Eva Swierski, who was 19 at the time that her father killed his second wife, said that her father threatened her in order to keep her quiet but then the guilt just became too much . ‘She just felt so bad for Reina and Reina's family that she could not carry it around anymore,’ Braker said. According to testimony, detectives asked Gary Swierski for his wife's dental records so they could match it to teeth if remains were found. They believe that caused Gary Swierski to panic and remove the skull from his wife’s decomposing body, which he then concealed in the spot where it was later discovered by hikers. The rest of Reina Swierski’s remains were never located, and her husband has told investigators they must have been carried off by wild animals.","Gary Swierski was arrested last year for the 2005 murder of his second wife .

There were ‘missed opportunities’ to save an expectant mother who bled to death when her placenta was ‘ripped out’ during childbirth, an inquest heard today. ‘Alarm bells’ should have been ringing when Claire Teague, 29, began asking for an ambulance shortly after the home delivery, midwife supervisor Suzanne Cro said. She told Windsor Coroner’s Court photographs of Mrs Teague’s placenta indicated it was ‘obvious’ 30 per cent was missing, which would have shown something was badly wrong. Probe: Claire Teague's husband Simon (left) pictured arriving at Windsor Coroner’s Court earlier today and independent midwife Rosie Kacary (right) seen outside the court with companions yesterday . Young mother Mrs Teague died after she suffered a massive haemorrhage caused by the incomplete delivery of her placenta during the home birth in the early hours of August 1, 2010. At the time, she was being cared for by independent midwife Rosie Kacary, who she hired when she became pregnant for the second time in 2009. It was after she had lost one of her twins during an emergency caesarean section earlier that year. Yesterday, Mrs Teague’s husband Simon told the hearing that he watched as Ms Kacary ‘ripped out’ his wife’s placenta using ‘a lot of force and tugging.’ Senior health professional Ms Cro was drafted in to write a report for the Nursing and Midwifery Council, to see if lessons could be learned from the tragedy. She told the hearing she felt Ms Kacary . should have noticed the placenta was not intact. Ms Cro said: 'I’ve . looked at the photographs and it’s very obvious that part of the . placenta is missing. Fatal: Mrs Teague was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading after she stopped breathing at home . ‘To me, looking at the photographs, I felt that the placenta does not look complete and would have had concerns about it.’ Ms Cro also said a text message from Mrs . Teague’s husband Simon as he became increasingly anxious should have . rung ‘alarm bells’ with Ms Kacary. 'I’ve looked at the photographs and it’s very obvious that part of the placenta is missing. To me, looking at the photographs, I felt that the placenta does not look complete and would have had concerns about it' Suzanne Cro, midwife supervisor . In the message, Mr Teague reveals that his wife, who was terrified of hospitals, is asking for an ambulance. ‘I would hope from that text that I would have asked for questions,’ Ms Cro said. ‘It would have set off alarm bells in my mind that if she is fit and well then why does she need an ambulance? ‘Especially someone like Claire who had an aversion to hospitals - I would be thinking: “Why now does she want to go in an ambulance?”’ Ms Cro also said she was concerned Ms Kacary’s notes of her discussions with Mrs Teague about the risks of a home birth were incomplete. As she had previously undergone a caesarean and required a blood transfusion, the expectant mother would have been at a higher risk of complications, she said. The inquest was told that the case was under investigation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Ms Kacary was previously investigated by the regulator for another birth but was allowed to keep practising, the hearing was told. The inquest, which is expected to finish today, continues.","Evidence from midwife supervisor Suzanne Cro who is working on probe .

Drug user Lucian Craven, 22, of Tring, Hertfordshire, was jailed for 18 months after committing a string of burglaries in his area last month. Behind bars: Drug user Lucian Craven, 22, of Tring, Hertfordshire, was jailed for 18 months after committing a string of burglaries in his area last month . He had been using 'party drugs' - such as cocaine, ecstasy and meow meow - and got into debt, owing £3,000, Tim Nutley, defending, said. The first incident was on August 3, when he attempted to climb in through the window of a 67-year-old man’s home in Emma Rothschild Court. But Craven woke the man up, who saw him halfway into the house, the court heard. He managed to run away after the man told him to ‘f*** off.’ Recorder Samantha Leigh told him: ‘You know the effect burglaries have on people - especially when they find people in their own homes. Then she added, during the sentencing hearing at St Albans Crown Court in Hertfordshire today: ‘This gentleman quite rightly told you to f*** off.’ Offence: The first incident was at 6am on August 3, when he attempted to climb in through the window of a man's home on Emma Rothschild Court in Tring . Three days after the botched attempt, at around midnight on August 6, Craven stole a laptop after getting into a house in Wingrave Road.

Craven was caught after his fingerprints were found on a whisky bottle discarded in a garden near the Longbridge Close address. His fingerprints were also found on the window of the house in Emma Rothschild Court. The TV and laptop were recovered, the court heard. Craven appeared for sentencing having pleaded guilty before magistrates to two counts of burglary and one of attempted burglary.

A Christian girl arrested for Koran burning in Pakistan  has been granted bail after a Muslim cleric was detained for trying to frame her. It remains unclear when Rimsha Masih, reported to have Down's Syndrome, will be released - it could be today if a payment is made. There are worries the child, reported to be between 11 and 16, could be in danger if she remains in her homeland. In Pakistan the mere allegation of causing offence to Islam can mean death. Lawyer Raja Ikram, one of Rimsha Masih's representatives, talks to journalists after the hearing in Islamabad. His client was granted bail after three weeks detention . He is joined by Paul J Bhatti, minister for national harmony, at a joint news conference. Several Islamist leaders have joined the outcry over the arrest . Police escort blindfolded Muslim cleric Khalid Jadoon as he is brought before a judge earlier this month. He was arrested on suspicion of framing Rimsha Masih . A Pakistani policeman reprimanded him after he attempted to shout slogans on arrival at the court in Islamabad . Those accused are sometimes killed even if they are found innocent by the courts. Robinson Asghar is an aide to Pakistan's minister for national harmony. He claimed if bail was met Rimsha would be reunited with her family at a secret location. He told Reuters there were no plans to send the youngster abroad. Rimsha was arrested after accusations by Muslim neighbours of burning Islamic religious texts. But police took cleric Khalid Jadoon into custody after witnesses claimed he ripped pages from a Koran and planted them in Rimsha's bag with burned papers. Activists and human rights groups insisted Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law was vague and widely abused. They claimed it dangerously discriminated against minority groups. Amnesty International called the bail decision 'encouraging.' Tahir Naveed Chaudhry leaves with armed security after appearing at her bail hearing . A spokesman said: 'The Pakistan authorities must take concrete steps to show that no one can commit abuses and attempt to excuse them as the defence of their religion. 'Today’s decision by a Pakistan court to grant bail to Rimsha Masih, a 14-year old Christian girl accused of blasphemy, is an encouraging step, but the Pakistan government must urgently reform its blasphemy laws to prevent similar cases in the future. 'Rimsha and her mother were first arrested by police on August 16 after an angry mob had gathered outside their house in Islamabad, accusing her of burning pages of the Koran, a crime punishable by death under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws. 'The case took another turn last week when police arrested a local cleric, accused of planting the burned Koran pages on Rimsha. 'This morning, a judge set a bail of one million Pakistani rupees, about £6,200, for Rimsha. 'Although Amnesty  welcomes the judge’s decision, serious challenges remain.' The human rights group claimed Rimsha, her family, and the Christian community in Islamabad remained in 'serious danger.' Wilson Chowdhry is chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association. He said: 'Although this is a small step . towards justice, she will still have to undergo a full trial unless . granted asylum in a western nation. 'Her safety is paramount and security at today's court hearing was significant. 'However the killing of Governor Taseer illustrates that extra-judicial killings are hard to prevent.' He was killed because he opposed the blasphemy law. 'We have asked the Foreign Office on their position with respect to granting asylum to Rimsha Masih and await a response,' Wilson said. 'MP Andrew Stephenson of Pendle has said it is highly likely that the UK would grant Asylum.' Pakistani Christians carry placards in Islamabad during a protest calling for the release of Rimsha. There have been calls to review Pakistan's blasphemy laws . Rimsha's arrest triggered an exodus of . several hundred Christians from her poor village after mosques reported . over their loudspeakers what the girl was alleged to have done. Christians, who make up four percent . of Pakistan's population of 180 million, have been especially concerned . about the blasphemy law, saying it offers them no protection. Convictions hinge on witness testimony and are often linked to vendettas, they complain. In . 2009, 40 houses and a church were set ablaze by a mob of 1,000 Muslims . in the town of Gojra, in Punjab province following reports of the . desecration of the Koran . At least seven Christians were burned to death during the attacks. Two . Christian brothers accused of writing a blasphemous letter against the . Prophet Mohammad were gunned down outside a court in the eastern city of . Faisalabad in July of 2010. Amnesty International warned the case could cause problems for 'communal harmony' in Pakistan. 'In the recent past individuals accused of blasphemy have been killed by members of the public, often in incidents where the victim has not been formally charged by the authorities,' the Amnesty spokesman said. 'Hundreds of Christians have fled Rimsha’s neighbourhood in Islamabad since she was accused, fearing violence. Her family remains in hiding. 'The Rimsha Masih case highlights the profound danger to communal harmony and rule of law caused by Pakistan’s blasphemy laws. 'Such cases will continue to occur, especially against vulnerable religious minorities, unless the Pakistan government urgently reforms the blasphemy laws to ensure they cannot be used maliciously to settle disputes or enable private citizens to take matters into their own hands.' Amnesty called on the authorities to ensure perpetrators of attacks on religious minorities were brought to justice in court that met international standards - without recourse to the death penalty. 'Amnesty welcomes the condemnation of . the charges brought against Rimsha Masih by a wide cross-section of . Pakistan society, including even from religious leaders who have in the . past vilified religious minorities and advocated strict application of . the blasphemy laws, including the imposition of the death penalty,' the spokesman said. 'But more important are legal, policy . and social reforms to address the general climate of vilification on . the basis of religion that has lead to almost daily intimidation and . deadly attacks on Christian, Shi’a, Ahmedi, Hindu and other minority . communities across the country.

Britain's economy received a much-needed fillip yesterday after exports to countries beyond Europe surged to an all-time high. Official figures showed UK firms sold a record £13.2billion worth of goods to non-European Union markets in July - up 11 per cent on the previous month. Sales to the EU were also up 7.7 per cent to £12.4billion but the proportion of exports going to the 17-nation eurozone fell to 43.6 per cent - the lowest since records began in 1988. Exports to countries beyond Europe have surged to an all-time high, shrinking the UK's trade deficit with the rest of the world . The shift to growing markets in Asia and Latin America, hailed by economists as a revolution in British trade, will cheer ministers and businesses who have toured emerging economies to forge new trade links as the single currency bloc lurches from crisis to crisis. Office for National Statistics figures showed it helped shrink Britain’s trade deficit with the rest of the world - the shortfall between exports and imports - from £4.3billion in June to £1.5billion in July. It was the largest narrowing of the trade deficit on record and fuelled hopes that Britain may finally be pulling out of recession. ‘Tellingly, non-EU exports have now been greater than exports to the EU for three consecutive months,’ said Colin Edwards, an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. ‘This is perhaps unsurprising given the economic malaise gripping much of the EU, driven by the sovereign debt crisis gripping the eurozone. ‘While the figures may demonstrate the weakness of the European export market more than the strength of UK exporters in non-EU markets, the change in export share may represent an important shift in the focus of UK exporters, as emerging economies become a more attractive proposition than struggling European economies.’ Number crunching: Balance of UK trade over past year (Source: ONS) The British economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter of the year and has now been in decline for nine months - marking the longest double-dip recession for more than 50 years. But hopes are rising that the economy will finally clock up growth again in the current third quarter as business bounces back from the disruption caused by the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘These figures are encouraging news on the UK economy and show that we are starting to earn our way in the world. The Government is working hard to deliver sustainable, export-led growth.’ The latest export figures followed the biggest surge in industrial production for 25 years. ‘It is looking ever more likely that growth in the third quarter will more than outweigh the 0.5 per cent contraction suffered in the second quarter,’ said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at research group IHS Global Insight. But with the crisis raging in the eurozone, and the global economy showing signs of slowing from the United States to China, the outlook is still uncertain. Mark Gregory, chief economist at accountant Ernst & Young, said: ‘The short-term outlook for exports remains fragile, with the eurozone on the brink of slipping back into recession and signs of a slowdown in the US and some of the main emerging markets like China and India. ‘But we are more optimistic about prospects further out, providing that the eurozone remains intact and drags itself out of recession.’",Shift to growing markets in Asia and Latin America hailed as a revolution in British trade .

In 1999, the Norfolk farmer Tony . Martin killed one of my constituents and injured another when they went . to burgle his farm. Quite rightly, Mr Martin was prosecuted and served . time in prison but the case became a cause celebrate. Last . Sunday, Andy Ferrie and his wife Tracey from Leicestershire used a . legally-held shotgun to defend themselves against a number of men who . are alleged to have broken into their property. Two . of them were wounded and the Ferries were held and questioned by police . for more than two days before being released at the behest of the Crown . Prosecution Service. Now, . the two cases are very different, but there is one important similarity . – the law does not protect householders from intrusion in the way I . believe that it should. In 2004, I initiated a Private Members' Bill that would have solved the problem. After the Martin case, there had been a very important change in civil law. Brendan Fearon, my constituent who had been wounded in the burglary, attempted to sue Mr Martin for the injuries that he caused. As . civil law then stood, he would have to prove that Mr Martin had used . 'unreasonable force'. Very quickly, though, the government of the day . amended civil law and raised the threshold using the phrase 'grossly . disproportionate' force. My . Bill was designed to bring criminal law into step with civil law. Dominic Grieve, the then Shadow Attorney General, drafted a simple . amendment which would have  the effect of giving ordinary householders . the protection of the 'grossly disproportionate' proviso. Legal protection: Brendan Fearon, right, attempted to sue Tony Martin, left . It seemed at one stage that the Bill . had the support of Tony Blair and the then Met Police Commissioner. Brendan Fearon even told my local newspaper that such a change in the . law would deter him from breaking and entering in future. The whole . issue was immensely popular. My Bill was scuppered by a disgraceful piece of chicanery  from the Labour Party. I . was delighted, then, when the Conservative manifesto in 2010 said: 'We . will give householders greater legal protection if they have to defend . themselves against intruders in their own homes.' Such . promises were not contained in the Coalition Agreement although the . Coalition has tweaked the law a little further. But it's cases such as . that of the Ferries that must cause decisive action to be taken now. This need can only be underlined by . the extraordinary statement from Judge Peter Bowers last week who . apparently told an offender that 'it takes a huge amount of courage ... for somebody to burgle somebody's house'. It is an astounding statement and the Prime Minister, absolutely properly, condemned it completely. But . he also went on to say 'that's why this Government is changing the law . to toughen the rules on self defence towards burglars'. Really? It's two years later and yet we still do not have the 'grossly disproportionate' phrase enshrined in criminal law. Released: Andy and Tracey Ferrie were held for more than two days by police . I don't want householders to be given . a licence to butcher intruders in their homes, but I do want normal . people to feel that the law is unquestionably on their side and  not on . that of the criminals. I . also want the police and the CPS to be confident about not putting . people like the Ferries through days of anguish when such anguish should . be reserved for offenders. When . they were in Opposition, the Tories seemed very clear about what needed . to be done. Indeed, many of my Bill's greatest supporters are now in . power. Yet, something is stopping them from putting their earlier words . into action. Dithering . doesn't deter.

Megan Kerrigan took the full force of the jagged glass in her face when Andrew  Wyness lashed out in the street in South Shields, South Tyneside, on March 17. The 17-year-old was left with devastating damage to her left eye, which her doctor said was the 'most severe injury' he had ever seen in a young woman. From happiness to depression: Megan Kerrigan, 17, has been left depressed about her looks after being hit in the face with a broken bottle on a night out. It is feared that the scarring and vision problems caused by the attack could last for life. Megan is pictured here (left) before the attack and (right) as she is now . She has been left scarred for life and has lost two thirds of the coloured iris  of her left eye.Medics managed to save her eye but she is unlikely to ever regain her full  sight. At Newcastle Crown Court yesterday Wyness, 23, of Bradford Avenue,  Sunderland, who has multiple previous convictions for violence and even cruelty to an animal, was jailed for 10 years with a four-year extended licence period. Judge Penny Moreland told him: 'You do pose a significant risk of causing harm  because of your previous convictions and because of the nature of this offence. 'You used a jagged bottle as a weapon against a 17-year-old girl who was  unarmed. 'Nothing she did that night begins to justify what you did to her. 'The consequences of what you did to her are appalling. 'She has to live with all that for the rest of her life.' Impact: Miss Kerrigan said the scarring left by the attack has completely undermined her confidence in the way she looks. She no longer wants to go out and socialise with her friends . Megan said in her victim statement the attack has made her completely  re-evaluate her life and that she will live with what happened forever. 'I find myself crying most of the time. It makes me feel ugly,' she said. 'I am going to have to carry this for the rest of my life. 'When you have had sight all of your life and then it's lost it's heartbreaking. 'I had beautiful eyes. I used to take pride and use make-up to accentuate the  look of my eyes. I am not sure if I ever will do again. 'I feel very conscious of people staring at me, children stare. Miss Kerrigan said her self esteem has dropped lower and lower since the attack. 'It will live with me forever,' she said. 'It has affected my life and I am sure you will understand it has affected my  parents’ too. 'I used to be outgoing, full of confidence, [But] I am struggling to get back to where I was before.' Thug: Andrew Wyness, 23, (pictured) from Sunderland, was jailed for 10 years at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday after smashing a broken wine bottle into Miss Kerrigan's face . Megan had been out with friends on the night of the attack when they walked past Wyness and  his friends at Wenlock Road, in South Shields. Trouble flared between the groups and Wyness headed to a nearby shop to arm  himself with bottles. CCTV footage shows Megan confronting Wyness in the shop in a bid to stop him  taking the weapons outside. But he smashes a wine bottle on the floor and storms into the street. Prosecutor Neil Pallister told the court: 'She describes trying to stop the  defendant, clearly she was concerned he was going to use the bottle against her  friends. 'She stepped in his way. 'He then punched her in the face with his left hand then immediately hit her with his right hand which was holding the bottle. 'She was hit in the face and she fell to the floor. 'She describes blood everywhere, all over her face. She was in shock and she started screaming. 'She was very frightened.'Miss Kerrigan was taken to hospital where a cut to her right eye was stitched. Her left eye had suffered extensive bruising, swelling and haemorraging and she needed surgery to repair the damage. Mr Pallister said: 'It seems likely the eye will be retained but it is far too soon to predict what level of vision there might be in future.' Medics hope Megan’s injured eye can be fitted with a special lens which will improve her vision in future but she remains at risk of further complications to both her eyes. Jamie Adams, defending, said Wyness, who admitted wounding with intent, was inconsolable when he was told of the extent of the injury he had caused. Mr Adams read an extract of a letter Wyness had sent to the judge in which he expressed his regret and remorse for what he did. It said: 'I was shocked and sickened and still am now. 'I don’t think this feeling will ever go away. 'It must be horrible for Megan and the people that love her to go through something like this. 'I wish I could go back and change everything. 'I don’t like what I’ve done, I don’t want to go through life hurting people, I don’t want to hurt anyone ever again.' Happier times: The pretty teenager (pictured left) gets a ride on a motorbike while on holiday before the brutal attack . Pretty: Miss Kerrigan (again pictured here on holiday before the attack) said she has been left feeling 'ugly' because of the injuries she suffered . Speaking after the court case, Miss Kerrigan's dad Alex, 48, a carer, of South Shields, said it has been a gruelling six months for his daughter. He said: 'The mirror is her worst enemy now. She had absolutely beautiful eyes. 'We’re happy with the sentence and hope it goes to highlight the problem the problem of knife crime and bottle attacks in this country. 'She has to live with this for the rest of her life.' After the sentencing, Miss Kerrigan, now 18, said: 'I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. She said she thought Wyness had taken her eye out with the bottle after she was hit. 'All I could see was bright red,' she said. 'I just passed out and the next thing I knew I was on the operating table.' Since the attack, the teenager says she has been left feeling too depressed and self conscious to go out socialising. She said: 'I just feel very depressed all the time about my looks. 'I don’t go out with my friends anymore.'","Megan Kerrigan collapsed in a pool of blood after being smashed in the face by Andrew Wyness .

A portrait bought nearly a century ago for just £70 could earn its owner a small fortune after being revealed as a missing masterpiece. The 1909 painting called Summer Idleness: Day Dreams by the celebrated but tragic artist John William Godward, fetched the relatively paltry sum of £70 when it went under the hammer at Christie's in London in 1937. At today's prices the £70 outlay is equivalent to £3,889 but experts believe the striking image of a woman resting on a marble chair could go under the hammer for between £150,000 and £200,000. Entitled Summer Idleness: Day Dreams, this picture by John William Godward is set to make between £150,00 and £200,000 when it goes under the hammer next month . After a short spell with London dealers . Vicars Brothers, the picture found its way to Harrods from where it was . purchased for £100 in 1957. Scholars only knew of the picture from a 1910 print but now the painting on canvas, measuring, 20ins x 30ins is set to make nearly 3,000 times its original value when it is auctioned at Lawrences in Crewkerne, Somerset, on October 12. It is being sold by the daughter of the woman who purchased it from the world famous department story 55 years ago. 'It’s a wonderful find,' Lawrences’ specialist, Richard Kay said. 'The owners knew that they owned a fine picture but had no idea that its whereabouts had been unknown for well over half a century.' Dr. Vern Swanson, a Godward expert recently assessed the picture from a photograph and declared it to be a revelation, commenting that it is one of the most sensitively coloured paintings by Godward. Godward led a turbulent life. He upset his middle class London family by pursuing a career in art rather than a more traditional profession. After a short spell with London dealers Vicars Brothers, the picture was purchased for £100 in 1957 from Harrods . He perfected a technique of painting gauzy fabrics, voluptuous feminine flesh and, in particular, an extraordinarily realistic rendering of marble that looks tangibly cold. Mr Kay continued: 'He enjoyed great successes at The Royal Academy until abstraction and modernism began to replace traditional historical themes in the early 20th Century. 'Godward further horrified his parents by living with one of his alluring models and then, as the real world failed to match his own idealised artistic vision of it, he took his own life in 1922.' Horrified yet again by such a scandalous death, Godward’s family cut his face out of all family photographs and then destroyed all his papers in disgust. As recently as 1979 this picture would have been worth barely £5,000 but Godward’s prices have soared in recent years. A very large work, A Fair Reflection made a record price of just under £900,000 in New York in May 2012. Mr Kay added: 'The appeal of Godward’s work is not just his meticulous technique but his graceful compositions and the atmosphere of serene thoughtfulness.'As we ponder the girl’s idle imaginings we share a little of her contemplative ease. 'It is a mesmerizingly calm picture and it offers a beautiful point of stillness in a hectic world.'","Painting by artist John William Godward made £70 in 1937 and sold for £100 in 1855 .

In two years’ time she would be Queen, her face printed on millions of stamps and banknotes. But at 23, she was still Princess Elizabeth – and this rare sketch offers a very private glimpse of that young woman, in all her girlish beauty. Drawn in charcoal and red chalk, the portrait shows the princess with rosebud lips and fine features, her large eyes lost in thought. The sketch has come to light ahead of its sale at Bloomsbury Auctions in London. Girlish beauty: The rare sketch shows the Queen - then a princess - at 23 The Queen, right, said she fondly remembered sitting for the artist . It was drawn in February 1950 by Dame Laura Knight, an impressionist painter also known for depicting the world of London’s theatre, ballet and circus. It has never been in the Royal Collection because Dame Laura made it for her own purposes, perhaps as a study to a larger portrait. But the sketch was recently shown to the Queen herself, who said that she fondly remembered sitting for the artist. At the time she would have been in the early stages of pregnancy with Princess Anne, who was born in August 1950. The portrait has remained hidden from the public since the father of the current owner, who wished to remain anonymous, bought it from Dame Laura in 1969, the year before her death. In a letter written to the buyer, she said: ‘I value the drawing of “Princess Elizabeth”, who bloomed like a flower in the field, and loved a bit of fun when occasion permitted.’ Mother: The Queen with baby Anne, left, in 1950.

In terms of beauty she has always been overshadowed by Princess Margaret but you see here that she was a very pretty girl. She was in the bloom of youth. It’s a little window into the Queen that we have forgotten.’ The sketch, valued at up to £12,000, will go on sale along with a series of letters between Dame Laura and the buyer.

Former Premier League footballer Gary Neville has been given the green light to build his controversial 'Teletubby' home - almost three years after plans were first unveiled. The Sky Sports pundit, who ditched earlier plans to power the 'carbon neutral' home with a wind turbine, was yesterday given permission to build the house in the heart of rural Lancashire by Bolton council’s planning committee. Councillor Andy Morgan, one of the committee members, said the application was innovative and that it was one of the only plans he had seen that was 'code 6' - the highest available score on a government energy rating system. Futuristic: An earlier artist's impression of Gary Neville's eco-home . Mr Morgan said: 'The turbine was the main issue for residents and it’s now gone. I believe the exceptional circumstances have been met because of code six and it is still an attractive and modern building. 'It’s not too obtrusive for residents and it’s a build which absolutely protects the environment. 'I think as a committee we should support this application.' Laa Laa Land: The innovative design is intended to have minimal impact on views of the Lancashire hills and has been likened to a Neolithic settlement . Proposals to include a 100-foot wind turbine were dropped by the former Manchester United player when developers came up with even 'greener' ways to power the house - which will be the first carbon-neutral house in Bolton and in the North West. It will include a ground source heat pump, sustainable rainwater harvesting and photovoltaic cells, which convert light into electricity. Mike Ralph, representing Neville, told the meeting: 'The first application generated over 100 objections, so before this new application we were careful to make sure with local residents, the plans take them into consideration. Home sweet home: Gary Neville can now look forward to building his eco-home after altering the design . 'There have been a few obstacles along the way, but the latest application only received two objections. 'There have been numerous people say to us they are grateful he has gone away and given a more thoughtful application. 'It will be smaller than before and will only take four to five months to build rather than the original 18 to 20 months.' The amount of land the five-bedroom home will take up has been also been reduced, because it will be built over two floors instead of just one storey. Much of the construction will take place off-site, reducing the time it will take to build the house and the potential noise and disturbance to neighbours.","Gary Neville's 'innovative' 5-bed eco-home designs given planning permission since abandoning wind turbine proposal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:22 EST, 15 September 2012 . A Moroccan-born man convicted of plotting to detonate a suicide bomb in Washington D.C. has been sentenced to 30 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed under a plea deal he struck. Amine El-Khalifi, 29, of Alexandria, Virginia expressed no remorse for his actions at Friday’s sentencing hearing. 'I just want to say that I love Allah. That’s it,' he told U.S. District Judge James Cacheris. Would-be martyr: Amine El-Khalifi, 29, expressed no remorse over his plot to detonate a suicide bomb in the U.S. Capitol . He was arrested in February in a parking garage near the Capitol, wearing what he thought was an explosive-laden suicide vest. In an undercover sting, agents posing as al-Qaida operatives had supplied him with an inert explosive vest and an inoperable gun. Under El-Khalifi’s guilty plea, the judge could only sentence him to a range from 25 to 30 years. Public defender Kenneth Troccoli argued for the minimum sentence. He said that El-Khalifi 'bore no ill will to the American people.' 'His motivation was simply to do what he thought God called him to do,' Troccoli said. Troccoli said his client, an illegal immigrant from Morocco, embarked on a largely self-taught rediscovery of his religion after a misdemeanor assault conviction in 2007. Before that, he had been active on the D.C. club scene, taking drugs and occasionally producing music. On the internet, he found videos and propaganda that reinforced extremist views. Place of capture: Amine El Khalifi was arrested in this alley near the Capitol . The FBI undercover operation gave him the means and the support carry out his perceived religious obligations. El-Khalifi was unwilling to die while in financial debt, and the agents gave him $4,300 to satisfy some overdue rent. And the agents promised to provide 'martyrdom payments' to his family of $500 or $1,000 per month after he carried out the suicide attack. The agents also provided moral support to 'convince him that he was right in what he was doing,' Troccoli said. Prosecutor Gordon Kromberg said El-Khalifi came to authorities’ attention in 2010, in part because he answered a Facebook post seeking to recruit Muslim holy warriors. Kromberg said it’s fortunate that the FBI got to El-Khalifi first and set up the undercover operation; otherwise, El-Khalifi likely would have found real terrorists to help him carry out an attack. Property: One of El-Khalifi's residences in Arlington, Virginia under investigation by police . 'This was a man who was not shy about what he wanted to do,' Kromberg said, noting that many of El-Khalifi’s acquaintances said he frequently talked about his desire to carry out a martyrdom attack that would wipe away his past sins. Kromberg urged the judge to impose a maximum sentence and said it should not matter that there was never any real danger that El-Khalifi could carry out an attack. 'We cannot wait until there are real, dead victims to enforce our laws,' Kromberg said. When the undercover agents first approached el-Khalifi, his initial idea was to attack an office building in Alexandria. He later suggested attacking a synagogue, a busy Washington restaurant and an Army general’s home before eventually volunteering to attack the Capitol. Busted: Police officers stand outside another of El Khalifi's residences in Arlington, Virginia . According to court papers, El-Khalifi detonated a test bomb at a West Virginia quarry and expressed disappointment that the explosion was not big enough. On February 17, the day of the planned attack, El-Khalifi went so far as to don what he thought was a bomb-laden vest packed with nails, and carried the inoperable automatic weapon that he would use to shoot past any guards who got in his way. El-Khalifi told the agents he would be happy if the attack killed 30 people. He will be deported to Morocco after serving his sentence. U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Neil MacBride, whose office prosecuted the case, said that 'El-Khalifi sought to bring down the U.S. Capitol, one of our nation’s iconic symbols. Since 9/11, our mission has been to find terrorists intent on attacking the United States before they act.'","Moroccan-born Amine El Khalifi arrested in February in FBI sting .

Terrifying footage emerged earlier this week showing football referee Cristobal Piñero being launched from a three metre high 'pyramid' ramp and then attacked twice on the ground by the beast. Today, speaking from his hospital bed, he has revealed how moving his head by just a fraction as the bull bore down on him for a second time 'almost certainly' saved his life. Waiting to be operated on for a fractured shoulder, broken right wrist, two splintered ribs and bruises on his legs, he thanked the the brave onlookers who came to his rescue. He said that without the help of those at the Monovar bullring, who distracted the bull so he could be carried out, he probably would not 'be here anymore'. He added: 'This goring will be the last because I'm not getting in the ring any more and, if I go again to see the bulls in the future it will be to watch it from the side. 'I was very close to death, one of the horns passed just centimetres away from my head when I was on the floor, and now I'm suffering. I don't want to put myself in that situation again.'

He was reportedly well known in his youth for spontaneously jumping over the bullring barrier at local bullfights. But, he said, he gave up his wild ways when his children were born in a bid to become more responsible. Three men wait on and near a three metre high 'pyramid' ramp just before a bull, lurking near the edge of the ring, brutally attacks one of them during a Spanish town's fiestas . Terrifying: The bull charges up the ramp towards one of the men and he tries to flee away from the beast . He added: 'But when, 10 years ago, my children were older I went back to my passion.' Of . Monday's incident, the Sax resident said: 'It was all my fault. I took . too many risks and was too confident because I didn't think the bull . would climb the stairs so quickly. 'I stopped and he threw me powerfully, I got caught, and in that moment I was already regretting getting into that situation. 'I . didn't lose conciousness at any moment, and I could see him flying down . the stairs and I thought that was the end for me. But it wasn't, thank . God.'

The Duke of Westminster claims his work in the Territorial Army is complete despite being due to retire soon . The Duke of Westminster has resigned as the head of the Territorial Army after a failed attempt to overhaul its image. The 60-year-old Duke, who is called Major General Gerald Grosvenor when in uniform, called for the TA to be renamed Army Reserves in a bid  to shed its ‘Dad’s Army’ reputation. But according to military sources, his campaign was defeated ‘almost unanimously’ by senior colleagues. Now, the Duke, who is Britain’s wealthiest landowner and worth £7 billion, has left the TA’s headquarters in  Andover, Hampshire, and his post as Deputy Commander, Land Forces. He will concentrate on raising funds . for projects such as the £300 million refurbishment of a stately home to . turn it into the country’s biggest rehabilitation centre for wounded . troops and civilians. He has also resigned from the Commonwealth War . Graves Commission to focus on the same cause. The Duke, who was due to retire from his TA post in six months, said last night his ‘work was done’ after a  40-year career. A . TA officer told The Mail on Sunday: ‘He was very frustrated to have not . persuaded his colleagues of the merits of changing the name from  TA to . Army Reserves. ‘To him, the name TA was out of date . and demeaning to the soldiers who give up their jobs to fight in . Afghanistan. He spent a year trying to push this through, meeting a lot . of resistance. He is not a man to stand on  ceremony or give up easily. I . am stunned and disappointed that he has gone, but his record in the TA . will be long remembered. ‘He . was promoted from the junior rank of trooper to major general and . achieved changes such as ensuring part-time troops are paid the same as . our day jobs when we deploy. 'Job done': The Duke of Westminster (right) resigns as head of the Territorial Army after failing to overhaul its image . ‘I would have liked him to have won the name-change argument because the name Territorial suggests all the TA does is defend home territory. Yet at any one time there are 500 UK reservists fighting the Taliban.’ The Duke’s final defeat came at  this summer’s Whither Warfare conference staged by the Ministry of Defence. He was told by senior TA officers that there was nothing wrong with the TA brand and the name should remain unchanged. Undeterred, he changed the title of the TA’s magazine, Territorial Army Quarterly, to Army Reserves Quarterly for its most recent edition. An editorial which appeared beneath his signature read: ‘The more observant reader will have noticed that the name of the magazine has changed. The debate has been going on for years over whether the Territorial Army should change its name. ‘In favour of the new name are those . who say that the name no longer  represents what we do and that today’s . TA is as operationally mobile as the regular Army. On the side of the . status quo are those who point out that the brand is strong.’ The Duke leaves the TA at a time when it is being expected to increase its deployable numbers. The Duke attempted to rebrand the TA as Army Reserves in a bid to shed it's 'Dad's Army' reputation . A Territorial Army regiment were awarded their Operational Service Medal after returning from a six month tour of duty in Afghanistan . In theory the TA consists of 37,000 deployable troops but in practice only about 14,000 are trained and available for use overseas. By 2020, it is hoped the TA will form an integral part of a 120,000-strong British Army, including 36,000 fully trained reservists ready to meet any challenge anywhere in the world. The Duke’s rehabilitation centre at Stanford Hall, Nottinghamshire, is expected to open in 2018. He is leading the refurbishment  programme at the Grade II-listed £6.25 million mansion which he has donated to the nation. The Duke said last night: ‘I have served in the Reserves for more than 40 years and while I was due to have retired next spring, I have decided to retire earlier. As far as I am concerned, the strategic job is done and I have achieved what I wanted to achieve.’","The Duke called for the Territorial Army to be renamed Army Reserves .

Daniel - a . first-year student studying English at the University of Manchester - . was left fighting for life in an intensive care unit but has since made a . miraculous recovery and later returned to college and completed his . exams. Today, the brothers were each starting 18 years in jail after both admitted attempted murder and robbery. Mongan, who instigated the violence by . punching Daniel first, was jailed for seven years after she admitted . robbery and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The accomplice: Lindsay's girlfriend Katie Mongan, 18, also of Longsight who instigated the violence by punching Daniel first was jailed for seven years after she admitted robbery and causing grievous bodily harm with intent . Manchester . Crown Court was told the attack occurred last February after Daniel - . from Barnsley, South Yorks, and described as a 'soft, sweet and gentle' person - had been out with friends at a student event at a bar in . Manchester city centre. He . got the bus back to the student district of Owens Park and ended up at . the Krunchy Fried Chicken takeaway where the gang were eating fast food. Brownlie . had been recently released from jail and had previously served a four . month prison stretch for affray after he hurled stones at buses, a . stretch limousine, taxis and cars as they drove past them. Daniel . was eating alone when he was approached by the gang and asked for a . cigarette and when he replied that he had none, a confrontation ensued. Mongan . shouted at Daniel he was being disrespectful to which the victim . responded: 'I’m sorry, I’m sorry, next time if I have any cigarettes I . will give him one.' The owner of the take-away ushered out the gang and purposely asked Daniel to stay behind fearing the gang were picking a fight. The teenager eventually left the shop . when the yobs moved on but he bumped into them again just minutes later . further down the road. The gang began hurling abuse at Daniel saying: . 'You disrespected us' then demanded he hand them a watch he received . from his father for his 16th birthday. Daniel . was so frightened he agreed to hand it over but he was then forced . further down the road and shoved into Platt Field park where the gang . took his mobile phone, cash card and PIN number. Afterwards . he was subjected to a savage kicking as he lay curled up in a ball. As . he lost consciousness the gang picked him and threw him the water face . down and left him to drown. Caught: The gang were caught after police studied CCTV. Lindsay and Mongan both blamed each other during police interview whilst Brownlie gave no comment to every question . The gang later used Daniel’s cash card to buy drink from an a 24 hour store and then two spent some of the money on sausage and egg McMuffin breakfasts. Daniel was found at 5.30am when the cyclist who was riding past the scene heard a groaning sound and spotted him lying on his side in the water which was about two inches deep. The witness tried to pull the teenager clear but was unable to reach him and dialled 999 from a nearby telephone box. Officers had to spend up two days carrying out inquiries to identify ginger-haired Daniel because he had no identification with him. His fingerprints were sent off for analysis and pictures of his smart blue checked shirt, Topman burgundy corduroy trousers and his smart brown leather shoes were released as part of a public appeal for help. The scene: Police scour Platt Fields Park, Manchester, where the attack took place . Left lunch: Pictured is a takeaway box left by the gang at the park . Eventually after a painstaking fingertip search of the brick culvert where he was discovered, forensics teams found a set of keys which they matched to the victim. The gang were caught after police studied CCTV. Lindsay and Mongan both blamed each other during police interview whilst Brownlie gave no comment to every question. Police believe without the intervention of the cyclist Daniel would have died. He was due to give evidence from behind a screen so he didn’t have to make eye contact with his attackers from the witness box but was spared the ordeal of reliving the assault after the gang pleaded guilty. Describing Daniel’s ordeal, Michael Lavery prosecuting said: 'The thrill of moving away from home, becoming independent for the first time has been tainted by this attack. He fears the memory of those events may never leave him. In a statement the Daniel's father Mick Whiteley said: 'Daniel is a harmless, well educated, articulate and kind young man and has been able to return to his studies' 'While he was in intensive care, his family didn’t know whether he would live or die.' In a statement the victim’s father Mick Whiteley said: 'Daniel is a harmless, well educated, articulate and kind young man and has been able to return to his studies. 'Given his strength of character and determination we have no doubts he will fulfill his potential and go on to have a happy and successful life in whatever field he chooses to work in. 'The future prospects for his attackers are obviously less certain and less positive as they begin the lengthy custodial sentences which they have been given, and which they richly deserved given the vicious, senseless and sustained attack on our son. 'We are eternally grateful for the fact that not only did Daniel survive his ordeal, but that the police force were able to find the culprits quickly and remove them from the streets, thereby ensuring they were unable to inflict such pain and suffering on other decent members of society.' Det Insp Terry Crompton from Greater Manchester Police: 'I can’t begin to imagine how Daniel must have felt on that night, as these three callous individuals dragged him to a secluded area of the park, subjected him to this horrific assault, robbed him and then threw him down a culvert with no second thought as to what would happen to him. 'If Daniel hadn’t been found early that morning, it is highly unlikely he would have survived this cowardly, vicious and unnecessary attack.'","Nicholas Lindsay, 21, and 26-year old .

A teenage girl has had her hair ripped from her scalp by a drill machine during wood shop class. The horrific accident occurred after 17-year-old Kayla Carrera's hair became tangled on Wednesday afternoon at Deltona High School, Florida, leaving a fellow student to tear her free. 'It just keeps throbbing and it burns a . lot,' Kayla, whose head now only bears clumps of hair, told CFNews13. 'It feels like open flesh.' Despite her injuries and obvious trauma from the incident, the school failed to call 911 for medical assistance - a decision her mother is lambasting as negligent. Ripped out: Kayla Carrera shows her partially bald scalp after her hair was ripped out by a machine in shop class . Kayla, who admits she should have had her hair tied back during the class, immediately started screaming for help after she became tangled and a student tugged out her hair, WKMG reported. Nancy Holland Wait, spokeswoman for . Volusia County Schools, said a school nurse looked at the girl's . injuries and deemed they did not need to call 911. But her mother, Lissette Carrera, disagrees, pointing out that her daughter in now largely bald and suffered bruising and swelling from the incident. Lissette said her 'heart was crushed' that the pain her daughter suffered wasn't deemed to be an emergency. She works at an kindergarten in the district and would have called 911, . she said. Hurt: Kayla admits she did not have her hair tied up - but her mother said the rule should've been enforced . Recovering: She became tangled in a drill machine - but staff at the school failed to call 911 for help . 'As an educator, I'm also a mother and . I'm a mom first,' she said. 'I would never place a child in jeopardy . like they placed my daughter.' She added that the school was negligent for failing to enforce rules that her daughter should have had her hair tied up. 'If she wasn’t following the . rules in the classroom, she should have never been allowed on that . machine in the first place because the teacher himself is putting her at . danger,' she said. 'He’s the adult, he supervises, she is the student. He should have told . her, put your hair back before you get on the machine, these are the . rules of the classroom, you must follow them.' Anger: Her mother, Lissette, said she was outraged the school did not call 911 for medical attention . Lissette added that someone in the school should have called her about her daughter's injuries, but instead it was up to the teenager to phone for help. She called her grandmother in tears. Fannie Seda said she rushed to her granddaughter and was 'shaking all over because the sight of her head was terrible'. She almost fainted when she saw her, she added. 'My husband had to pick me up and I said I must rush her to the emergency room right now,' she said. They went to Florida Hospital Fish Memorial and Kayla was given painkillers, which she continues to take. Scene: Staff at the Florida school said a nurse checked Kayla and deemed they did not need to call 911 . 'I would rather err to the side of . caution,' her mother added. 'Someone there should have made the judgment . call to call 911. She shouldn’t have called for help herself.' The school district opened an investigation on Thursday morning to see if the teacher took appropriate action and if he had appropriate supervision in the classroom at the time. Carrera said she also met with the principal at Deltona High and the shop teacher on Thursday to discuss what had happened and said the school is looking into making safety changes.","Kayla Carrera became tangled and classmate had to pull her free .

He quoted from a report from the vet which said the 'flat was not suitable for human habitation, never mind animals'. Boardman was served with an improvement notice giving her the chance to clean up the flat but the mess was not tidied. Sarah Glanville, defending, said she had become 'overwhelmed' by the number of pets and their living conditions had become unacceptable. But she said the dogs and cats helped her client cope with her mental health problems. The court also heard that she also had horses, but these were in livery and were treated well.

Tangled: Lydia Bishop was pronounced dead in . hospital after she suffered serious injuries in the play area at . York College Nursery, York . A three-year-old girl died after becoming tangled in ropes on playground equipment on her first day at her nursery, it has been revealed. Lydia Bishop was pronounced dead in hospital after she suffered serious injuries in the play area at the £42-a-day York College Nursery, York, yesterday afternoon. Police have confirmed it was the girl's first day at nursery. She is thought to have used a 5ft metal slide at the college’s nursery and then become stuck on the ropes that were part of another piece of equipment. It is not known whether she fell from the slide onto the ropes. Det Chief Insp Nigel Costello said a . full investigation was now underway at the nursery to establish how the . accident happened and if it could have been prevented. The nursery is to remain shut until at least early next week. Parents of other children who attend the nursery paid tribute as they arrived to lay flowers. Mother-of-two Claire Gibb, 36, a marketing officer whose two children have been attending the nursery since March, said: 'It's an amazing place. I always felt at ease leaving my kids here. 'I've noticed that whenever there were kids playing on the slide there was . always somebody supervising it. 'I can't imagine what the little girl's parents are going through right now. My heart to their whole family.' Another mother, Rebecca Thompson, 40, also laid flowers and a card, reading: 'To a lovely little girl, rest with the angels'. She said her three-year-old son had only been going to the nursery for a week and she believed it was the little girl's first day there when tragedy struck. 'It is so sad, it doesn't even bear thinking about, everyone expects to pick their child up from nursery don't they?' Investigation: Inspectors walk around the playground this morning following the tragedy yesterday at York College's nursery in York. The 5ft tall metal slide can be seen in the foreground . The nursery cares for the children of students at the college and provides work placements for students . Inspectors were at the scene today taking photographs of the slide and a black rope that appeared to be tied around the side of it. The City of York Safeguarding Children Board's (CYSCB) Manager, Joe Cocker, released a statement announcing a major review into the incident was taking place. He said: 'A multi-agency investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of this young child is underway, involving the police, City of York Safeguarding Children Board (CYSCB), Ofsted and the Health & Safety Executive. The slide the little girl is thought to have used, with cord wrapped around the top . 'The CYSCB is working closely with partners to coordinate the enquiries of the various agencies in order to understand what happened and why it happened. 'Most importantly, at this stage, there is a need to ensure that support is provided to the family, the families of children who attend the nursery and the nursery staff. 'The investigation is at a very early stage and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.' In a statement the college said it was . 'devastated' and said it was doing all it could to help the authorities . with their investigation into the tragedy. North Yorkshire Police said they did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances. The . scene was last night cordoned off while officers investigated the . incident and Ofsted and the Health and Safety Executive were informed. Officers were called to the area on Sim Balk Lane at around 2.35pm yesterday by the ambulance service. The college said in a statement: 'York .

'Excessive speed': Michael Yeates, 20, was sentenced to three years jail after he hit and killed an 80-year-old man . A young man has been jailed after he mowed down and killed a Royal British Legion standard bearer while driving at ‘excessive speed’ to show off his souped-up car. Michael Yeates, 20, had only passed his driving test three months earlier and had already written off one vehicle when he hit Frank Fielding, 80, in Rishton, Lancashire. Eye witnesses said they heard the ‘roar of an engine’ and noticed Yeates looking down, not paying attention to the road ahead in the lead up to the fatal accident. Tests showed he was travelling at 47mph in the 30mph zone when he hit Mr Fielding as he crossed the road outside a local library in October last year. The victim, a widower and grandfather of five, suffered fatal injuries and later died at Royal Blackburn Hospital. Yeates, of Longridge near Preston, admitted causing death by dangerous driving at Preston Court yesterday and was sentence to three years in jail. He also admitted insurance fraud after he failed to notify his insurers about engine changes after he replaced the engine of his new 1.2 litre Vauxhall Nova with a 1.6 litre engine, making his policy invalid. Judge Jonathan Gibson, in passing sentence, said: ‘No sentence I can pass can ever compensate Mr Fielding’s family for their very great loss. Killed: Frank Fielding, 80, suffered fatal injuries when Yeates' car hit him as he crossed the road. He was a long-serving member of Rishton's Royal British Legion branch . ‘What you did highlights the very grave dangers posed by driving at excessive speed and the catastrophic consequences that can result from that and a failure to observe the road ahead. ‘Your driving was plainly irresponsible and the consequences beyond description.’ In court Mr Fielding was described as a ‘sprightly man’ and ‘active member of the community’, serving the Royal Horse Guards in Chelsea and Windsor for 10 years and was a long-serving member of Rishton’s Royal British Legion branch. He regularly supported poppy campaigns and in September last year was the standarad bearer at the funeral of a local marine commando who was killed in Afghanistan. Eye witness Antonia Bates said she heard the roar of an engine and saw Mr Fielding crossing the road at about 5pm on October 18. In a statement she said: ‘I looked and saw the driver of the car. He wasn’t looking ahead. He was looking down towards the gearstick. Where he was hit: Mr Fielding was crossing the road near the local library in Rishton, Lancashire when Yeates mowed him down. According to tests, he was driving 47mph in the 30mph zone . ‘As he looked up he had no time to react. He hit the man and pressed the brakes at the same time.’ Yeates had initially tried to blame Mr Fielding for the crash, claiming he ran onto the road. He told paramedics: ‘Why did he run out? He hesitated and he just ran out. He was in the middle of the road.’ But his consel Sharon Watson said: ‘This is a young man who is terribly, terribly sorry for the suffering he has brought on the Fielding family.’ Yeates had passed his driving test in August last year but just three days later wrecked a 1.6 Vauxhall Nova when he drove it into a hedge. He then acquired another Nova, a less powerful 1.2litre, but without telling insurers he changed the engine and gearbox to the more powerful versions taken from the wrecked model. Judge Jonathan Gibson said at Preston Court yesterday: 'No sentence I can pass can ever compensate Mr Fielding's family for their very great loss' Yeates was disqualified from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended test before he can return to the wheel. After the case Sgt Dave Hogarth from Lancashire Constabulary said: ‘This is a tragic case for both families and highlights the stupidity of reckless speeding, which played a huge part in this tragic incident. ‘The terrible consequences of this collision should serve as a strong warning to people not to speed.’ Former Hyndburn mayor and Mr Fielding’s family friend Paul Barton said: ‘Frank was known by everyone in Rishton and thought of the people in the town as his family. ‘He was a true gentleman, a gentle giant and I just found it so, so tragic the way he died. I feel sorry for both families involved, they will be feeling it too. Frank as the people’s champion in Rishton for so many years. He was a cracking fellow.’","Michael Yeates, 20, was driving at 'excessive speed' when he hit and killed Frank Fielding, 80 .

On trial: Deputy headmaster Adam Williams allegedly met a 16-year-old pupil for gay liaisons in school as the pair carried on a gay love affair . A married teacher and a 16-year-old pupil carried on a gay love affair during which they met for sexual encounters in the school common room, a jury heard. Deputy headmaster Adam Williams of Cheltenham, Gloucester, also met the boy for gay liaisons in an attic to a school building where they were almost caught in the act by a cleaner, it is claimed. The 35-year-old head of sixth form exchanged thousands of texts with the boy, including explicit pictures, after they met using mobile gay dating app Grindr, the court was told. Williams was said to have been on both ends of sex acts with the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in the school common room after other pupils had gone home. They also kissed in Williams's office and fondled in his car in quiet lay-bys, the jury was told. Over the course of their alleged affair Williams and the boy exchanged almost 8,000 messages, among them naked photos of the teacher, whose wife is also a teacher. The defendant, who has two children, even joked in one text message to the youngster that should their affair ever be exposed then the press would 'love it', adding: 'Technically you’re a junior.' Opening the case for the prosecution, Christopher May told the hearing at Oxford Crown Court: 'Exchanges of messages and communications over texts involved a young man who was a student at the school. 'This came about in the late spring of 2011 when Mr Williams was accessing a gay communication application known as Grindr. 'Through this site he established contact with a young man, who turned out to be a 16-year-old pupil at the school. 'At the outset he (the pupil) didn’t give his true identity. At the beginning Mr Williams didn’t know who the person was that he was communicating with. 'Through the course of these communications Mr Williams expressed clearly how keen he was to meet up for sexual purposes. '(Initially) the schoolboy was saying he was someone called James Rule, who was 20 and worked in retail. 'But by June 15, 2011, and although Mr Williams had suspected it might be him that he was in contact with, he (the teen) confirmed he was the pupil.' The youth was a student at the school where Williams worked and taking his GCSE examinations that summer. Nothing happened between them over the summer term or over the summer holidays, the jury of seven women and five men was told. The pupil was planning to leave the Oxfordshire school after completing his GCSEs and was set for an apprenticeship at Thomson Holidays in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said Mr May. However, during the course of the summer holiday he decided he wanted to remain at the school and join the Sixth Form to take his A-levels after the apprenticeship fell through. The dark-haired defendant, who appeared in court dressed in a smart dark suit and tie,  had the role of deciding whether the pupil could rejoin the school in the Sixth Form. 'Text message exchanges continued during that period,' Mr May told the jury. 'It’s quite clear that Mr Williams knew who it was he was in contact with. 'In due course they did meet up and had a number of incidents of a sexual nature.' The barrister said it was a criminal offence for teachers to engage in sexual activity with somebody under 18 who is a pupil at the school where they work. There was a total of 6,461 exchanged . text messages and 1,430 through Ping, a chatroom website, between May . and December last year. 'There . were seven meetings between the two where sexual activity took place.' Sometimes it was kissing, and other times they engaged in sexual acts, . prosecutor said. On one . occasion the pair were in the attic above the common room for which . Williams had a key, the court heard. The teacher was allegedly . performing a sex act on the boy when they were interrupted. 'Footsteps . were heard on the spiral staircase and it was the cleaner,' said the . prosecutor. 'He (the youth) was told to hide under a table.' Later . the pair were said to have exchanged messages referring to the near . miss. The teacher texted: 'I’m shi**ing it. He’s gone. I can’t believe . it.' The youth sought to calm the panicked teacher by saying: 'For every hour that passes we know we are in the clear.' Williams also texted the schoolboy after the near miss, saying: 'Shame I didn’t get to finish what I started.' 21st century dating: The website of smartphone app Grindr, through which Williams and the boy are said to have met . The alleged victim, now 17, told police he did not feel like a victim and claimed he had 'betrayed' his teacher by telling detectives what happened. 'First of all I felt a bit nervous about the experience then afterwards I felt disgusted,' he said during an interview with officers. 'I realised what we had done and I was shocked.' Asked how he then felt when the matters came to light, the teenager replied: 'I felt guilty that I did it. 'I did have feelings for him - I still do and I feel I betrayed his trust a little but if it was the right thing to do, I don’t know. 'I don’t feel like I’m the victim. I was the one who agreed to it.' The youth appeared in the witness box and looked through the messages allegedly exchanged with Williams over an eight-month period last year. Mr May read some aloud. 'I don’t think you realise how much I want you,' the teacher wrote. The teacher also wrote: 'I’ve never been in this situation. I don’t know what to say.' The pupil replied with the message: 'I think it was bound to happen.' Williams said he could be sacked and was worried about his job if word about the relationship got out. 'Yes I’ve kissed a student, it’s a sackable offence,' said Williams. Mr May told the court how the affair was only exposed when the pupil's sister looked through his mobile phone and found both text messages and images on the phone which were sexual. 'They talked about meeting up in rooms at school. She asked her brother about the messages and somewhat reluctantly he said it was Mr Williams,' the barrister said. 'She saw explicit images of Mr Williams including his bottom, penis, in the office she knew to be the Sixth Form office, in the shower, and on the bed on all fours naked.' Williams denies seven charges of engaging in sexual activity with a child in a position of trust and one count of encouraging or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity in a position of trust. Williams was expected to argue that he was being blackmailed by the boy about the sexual relationship after the swapping of compromising pictures, Mr May told the jury. The case was adjourned until tomorrow when Edmund Vickers, defending Williams, will cross-examine the alleged victim.

That was the question on the minds of scientists in the late 1950s - looking to see if items like beer and soft drinks were still drinkable if an atomic bomb went off nearby. The experiment was conducted as a part of Operation Teapot, a sequence of nuclear weapons assessments by the U.S. Military in 1955. Scroll down for video . Tempest in a teapot: Several nuclear explosions were set off in a series of tests in the 1950s known as Operation Teapot . Ain't that a kick in the can? Cans and bottles are pictured during the experiment . Documentation of the 1957 experiment has now been made available by science historian Alex Wellerstein, who runs the blog Restricted Data. The cans and bottles were set up in three positions ranging from 0.2 miles to one mile away from ‘ground zero’ of the atomic blast. The study found that the drinks were mostly unaffected by the radiation - except for the few bottles that were shattered by the force of the bomb blast. There was however, a question of a taste in the beer. Survival: Scientists questioned whether beverages like beer and soft drinks were still drinkable if an atomic bomb went off nearby . Still life: A row of mannequins are situated about 7000 feet from a blast site during one of the nuclear bomb test detonations held as part of Operation Teapot . The document read: 'Some flavor change was found in the beverages, more in beer than in soft drinks.' Drinks placed more than 1,270 feet away from ground zero showed no change to their consistency or taste. They also retained their airtight carbonation. The study ruled that the containers housing soft drinks and beer would be OK for consumption in the event of a nuclear explosion. Results: Drinks placed more than 1,270 feet away from ground zero showed no change to their consistency or taste .

The accuser said while they were at the deserted gate, Bertrand asked if he could get a kiss, and when she effused, he became violent, telling her that she was his ‘sex slave,’ and that he was going to teach her to ‘feel pleasure for pain.’ ‘Every time I tried to move he kept hitting my head on the ground,’ she said in court, the Denver Post reported. The woman said her attacker eventually took her pants off and raped her. She said he slammed her head to the ground so many times to keep her subdued that she became dizzy, had blurry vision and trouble hearing. The woman previously said that the attack lasted 20 minutes, during which time two janitors walked past, including a woman, but they looked away and did nothing. Eventually, a pair of airline mechanics intervened during the incident that took place on the deserted Concourse A at the usually crowded airport. However, Bertrand's lawyer, Wadi Muhaisen, claims the woman had rough, consensual sex with Bertrand and then regretted it. Face to face: The unnamed accuser left, told the jury how Bertrand, right, repeatedly slammed her head to the ground and ripped her crucifix while sexually assaulting her . Fateful meeting: The alleged attack took place on April 12, 2011, after both Bertrand and his accuser missed their flight connections and got stranded at the airport overnight . On April 12, 2011, the alleged victim was on her way to a Catholic convent community in Illinois where she was set to enroll in a religious studies program. She missed her connection and went to the airport bar, where she ran into Bertrand, who was also stranded at the airport overnight. The 23-year-old told the jury that Bertrand, then 26, appeared to be a nice guy, and the two struck up a conversation about religion, philosophy and his military service. At around midnight, the two were captured on surveillance video walking together to the waiting area at one of the gates. That is when the decorated former U.S. Marine suddenly turned on her, demanding a kiss and then grabbing her by the hair after she rebuffed him, the woman told the court. ‘I was making gagging sounds,’ she said. ‘I wasn't trying to say “no” anymore. I was just trying to breathe. He was saying that the sound I was making was sexy.’ Appeal to higher power: The woman, a Catholic who was on her way to a religious studies program, said she was reciting the Hail Mary prayer throughout the attack . At one point, Bertrand ripped her crucifix and threw it to the ground. Throughout the assault, the alleged victim, who is a practicing Catholic, continued praying. ‘The whole time I was trying to pray Hail Marys in my head,’ the woman recalled. ‘Then I heard shouting. It sounded really far away.’ The screams came from two Frontier airline mechanics, Kris Musil and Mark Adams, who came to her aid and pulled Bertrand off the woman. In response, the Marine tried to hug the bruised woman and told them that they could not distinguish between rough sex and fighting. Evidence A surveillance camera at the airport captured Bertrand walking with the woman prior to the alleged attack . Rescuers: Two Frontier mechanics, Mark Adams, left, and Kris Musil, right, saw the woman on the floor and came to her aid, pulling Bertrand off of her . Bertrand is said to have told the . detective who interviewed him that he prefers a 'dominant-submissive . role' and believed the woman wanted to be submissive. Stellar service: Bertrand was a Marine for about six years, from 2003 to 2009, during which time he received won the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal . During the Tuesday’s hearing, the . defense challenged the alleged victim’s claim that it was a rape, saying . that she did not make any effort to distance herself from Bertrand. ‘You didn't pull away from him. You didn't roll over. You didn't just drop,’ Muhaisen said. In response to the 23-year-old’s assertion that she could not call for help because she was  having an asthma attack, the attorney said that in the past, she was capable of screaming even at a time of respiratory distress, but not on that day last April. Muhaisen challenged other parts of the woman's testimony as well, pointing out that she had not told anyone about certain details of the attack, among them Bertrand biting her face around her mouth or groping her breasts, prior to the trial. The Denver Post reported that Bertrand was a Marine for about six years, from 2003 to 2009, and that he won the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. According to Leatherneck, a Marine magazine, Bertrand served as a corporal at U.S. embassies including Dublin in Ireland and Caracas in Venezuela.","Ex-Marine Noel Bertrand, 27, accused of raping a woman, 22, at Denver International Airport last April .

Victim: John Kiernan, pictured, was killed by heroin addict Phillip Haslam and left for two weeks . A heroin addict that bound and gagged a burglary victim before battering him to death with a brick was today issued a life sentence. Phillip Haslam, 36, was found guilty at Northampton Crown Court of murdering vulnerable John Kiernan, 62, in his own home and will serve a minimum of 32 years. Mr Justice Henriques told Haslam: 'Your behaviour was brutal, merciless and wicked.' Haslam repeatedly targeted the home of Mr Kiernan and in September last year 'hog-tied' him using electrical cable and gagged him with a sock before leaving him to die after the brutal attack. The court heard Haslam was searching for money to fund his heroin addiction and even made Mr Kiernan sign a £90 cheque when he could not find any cash before assaulting him. Shockingly, the victim’s body may have laid undiscovered for up to two weeks after Haslam returned to the flat in the days after his death and moved Mr Kiernan’s mail so as not to arouse neighbours’ concerns. When police finally broke into the address on October 1, they found Mr Kieran’s decomposing body on the bed with his hands and feet bound behind his back. A pair of trainers and gloves with traces of Mr Kiernan’s blood on them found at Haslam’s address linked him to the murder. Crime scene: A police officer stands at Havelock House, in Havelock Street, Kettering, where the murder took place . Haslam, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, admitted two burglaries but denied killing Mr Kiernan. But a jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict yesterday following a three week trial. The judge said: 'That verdict was inevitable. There are few murder trials where the evidence is so completely overwhelming and unanswerable. 'Indeed the defendant himself failed to answer the allegations (in not giving evidence).' Haslam was also sentenced to eight years for robbery and 40 months for two burglaries. He also admitted a separate incident on 1 September 2011, where another vulnerable man - aged 62 from Kettering - was savagely robbed. During this incident, Mr Haslam’s . girlfriend, Christine Windle, 37, lured the man to a block of flats . where Haslam repeatedly hit him over the head with a hammer, causing . head injuries and breaking his fingers. Forensics: Police search teams investigate a yard next to where Kiernan was killed . Investigation: PCSO Michael Roche delivers the posters following the death of John Kiernan to homes nearby . Windle pleaded guilty to this offence and was sentenced to six years for robbery and two years for handling stolen goods. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Woliter, from Northamptonshire Police, who led the investigation, said: 'Mr Kiernan was a vulnerable and lonely man who was targeted by Phillip Haslam in August and September 2011, repeatedly burgling his house. He used fear and violence to steal money from Mr Kiernan to fund his spiralling drug and alcohol habit. 'On 19 September 2011, when Mr Kiernan tried to resist Phillip Haslam’s demands and threats, he was ultimately subjected to a brutal and savage attack where he was tied up and beaten to death. 'I welcome today’s sentence which resulted in Phillip Haslam being sentenced to life imprisonment. 'My thoughts are with Mr Kiernan’s family during what has been a difficult year. Whilst horrendous cases like this are rare, the sentence today shows that those who commit crime will be bought to justice.'","Victim was tied up with electrical cables and gagged with a sock .

Now the 74-year-old building has been given a new lease of life after being transformed into a luxurious contemporary home spread over six floors, featuring striking circular rooms, lift access, and a magnificent terrace to take advantage of its panoramic views over the Flemish countryside. While the exterior of the building has changed little since the days of Nazi rule, the interior has been stripped out to make way for a stunning high-spec kitchen, an enormous living area boasting 360 degree views, and a vast bathroom that occupies an entire floor of the tower on the outskirts of the village of Steenokkerzeel.

This is the terrifying moment a pedestrian leapt over the barriers of a level crossing and came within inches of being struck by Britain's fastest train. Drivers watched in horror as the man, believed to be 61, hopped over the barrier as the 140pmh Japanese-built Javelin train approached at high speed. Astonishingly, the man fell over in the middle of the track but managed to pull himself to his feet and escape the thundering engine with just inches to spare. Close call: The man leapt over the . barriers of a level crossing in Gillingham, Kent, before rushing to the other side just before Britain's fastest train came thundering through . A series of heart-stopping pictures captured the man running across the track as a terrified railworker shouts at him to stop. The man is then seen in the middle of the track before the train comes speeding past. In another picture his feet can be seen just underneath the vehicle - showing how close he came to instant death. The near miss happened at a crossing in Gillingham, Kent, at 4.20pm last Friday. Horror: He starts to run as drivers waiting in their cars can only look on in horror . Stop! A terrified railworker (pictured right) can be seen leaning out of a window shouting at the man to stop . After avoiding the train the man, who was frozen with fear, was hauled over the barrier by Laura Robinson, who was waiting with her two children. The shocking moment was captured on camera by photographer Steve Crispe, 52, who was waiting in the traffic leading to the crossing. He said today: 'I was just sitting in the traffic and all of a sudden this guy runs past my car. 'I knew what he was going to do, he just ran straight up to the barrier and jumped over it, but as he did so he fell over in the middle of the track. Whoosh! Despite falling over in the middle of the track, the man, thought to be 61, makes it to the other side with just inches to spare . 'He did manage to get back on his feet, but it all happened so quickly the train just appeared and had just managed to get to the other side of the track, but still behind the barrier, as it went by. 'It was unbelievable, I thought to myself he was so stupid, but lucky not to be dead. 'The guys in the train tower next to the level crossing were looking out of their window and couldn't believe what had just happened either.' Lucky: After the 140-mph train thunders past a bystander, who was with her children, hauled the man over the barrier to safety . Brave Laura also described the moment she helped haul the man to safety. She said: 'The children were on top of the bridge watching the trains pass under and they yelled they could see the train coming. 'All of a sudden I heard the barriers clanging over the crossing and he was trying to climb over the barrier. He stumbled and fell flat on his back on the track side. 'He looked at the train coming and stumbled across the tracks, by which time I yelled at the children not to look. 'The train beeped the horn and he just hit the barrier, I ran over to him and begged him to just climb over, but he just lent on me so I just hauled him over, he was a dead weight and I think my adrenalin had just kicked in. 'I felt sick for ages and felt for the poor train driver, I'm just glad it was a happy ending.' The Japanese-built high-tech Javelin train is the fastest in Britain and can reach speeds of up to 140mph.

When Hornby secured a deal to produce official London 2012 merchandise it was lauded as a major coup for the iconic British toymaker, which hoped it would provide a much-needed boost to profits. But the spectacular success of this summer's 'Golden Games' didn't rub off on the manufacturer after bizarre Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville failed to impress a baffled public. Shares in Hornby plummeted by more than a third after it was forced to issue a profits warning on the back of poor sales of its Olympic merchandise, and the firm has now slashed prices by up to 85 per cent in an attempt to shift the unpopular souvenirs. Panned: Sales of Olympic mascots Wenlock, left, and Mandeville, right, have flopped . 'Disappointing': Hornby shares have struggled over the past year . Based upon blobs of steel and . featuring a single eye each, less-than-cuddly mascots Wenlock and . Mandeville were designed to symbolise the 2012 Games with their Olympic . Ring-inspired friendship bracelets, and featured a nod to the capital in . the form of London 'taxi lights' on their heads. But . the public failed to warm to the strange figures and a whole of host of unsold . Wenlock and Mandeville branded souvenirs and collectibles are now gathering dust on . toyshop shelves. Hornby has knocked £96 off the price of a 12-pack of London 2012 die-cast Wenlock or Mandeville figurines, which are now on sale for £23.88, while many single figurines - originally priced £9.99 - are now selling for £2.99. The toy firm, which is behind Scalextric and Corgi and also makes model railways, had hoped sales of Olympic merchandise would see a boom in profits, but admitted that demand for London 2012 products had been disappointing. It said that, while early demand for Games-related goods had been encouraging, major retailers had also purchased 'substantial quantities' of 2012 merchandise from other licensees. When the anticipated sales rush failed to materialise, the big retailers introduced deep discounts on the products. 'The consequence of this for Hornby was that retailers lost confidence in many categories of London 2012 merchandise, and repeat orders for our products were cancelled,' the company said. Hornby's shares slumped 37 per cent or 32.37p to 56.13p after it issued the profits warning - its third this year - yesterday. Shares had risen to 62.13p today. The toymaker, which has also suffered from major disruption at one of its largest suppliers in China, said it is now expecting to only break even in the current financial year. Last year it made profits of £4.5million. Reduced: Hornby has slashed prices on souvenirs including this Cadbury chocolate machine which is down from £9.99 to £3.99 . Poor sales: 'Destination London 2012' model black cabs, originally £4.99, are now £2.49 . Souvenirs: Hornby has knocked £15 off the price of this hand-finished London 2012 showjumping figurine - it is now selling for just £4.99 . Demand: This London 2012 train pack is now out of stock after being reduced by £30 to £119.99 . Olympic-inspired: Hornby's Scalextric Team GB Track Cycling Velodrome set is still full price at £69.99 . Poor Olympic sales have led Hornby to introduce significant reductions on everything from Wenlock and Mandeville figurines to Destination London 2012 Taxis - now priced £2.49. But a London 2012 branded train set was still selling on the website for the full price of £99.99, as was the Scalextric Team GB Track Cycling Velodrome kit, suggesting the firm is banking on more robust demand for at least some of the merchandise. Sale: Hornby has slashed prices on London 2012 themed merchandise after anticipated demand for the products failed to materialise .

The firm had put its hopes in Olympics fever to help revive flagging UK sales, which fell four per cent in the last financial year.

But despite their symbolic meaning - and an elaborate 'back story' penned by children's author Michael Morpurgo - the creations were largely panned by the public. The much-criticised mascots attracted further controversy ahead of the Games when it emerged that school were being charged a fee of £850 for a visit from actors dressed as Wenlock and Mandeville. Schools could pay the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games £600 for one of the mascots to attend a community event or multi-school sports day, or £850 for both. Critics pointed out that the mascots had been created to 'connect young people with sport', but claimed the sizeable fee meant only the richest schools would be able to welcome Wenlock and Mandeville. At the time LOCOG insisted schools interested in a visit from the mascots were being charged at cost price.","London 2012 merchandise failed to provide anticipated profits boost for manufacturer Hornby .

A woman who stashed two stolen gold bars into her bra had 'no idea' what they were, a court was told. Sheron Mancini put the bars - each weighing up to 1kg in her bra - in a 'panic' when detectives hunting a £1million bullion heist gang arrested her. The 53-year-old was 'beside herself with worry and fear' when she found the iPhone-sized bars in her coat pocket after she and her boyfriend David Gale, 55, were stopped by Belgian police and arrested. Despite being frisked briefly by a motorcycle cop, Mancini from Harlow in Essex claimed she had no idea of the bars existence until after being quizzed and led to the police cells. Giving evidence at the Old Bailey she said: 'I was absolutely beside myself with worry and fear. I panicked. 'I did not know what it was. I knew it should not have been there. I took them out and put them in between my cleavage, not in my cups.' She denied police claims that she hid the stolen bars in special compartments in . the bra as part of a bid to smuggle them into Britain. She told the jury: 'It was like a living nightmare. It could have been anything but it turned out to be gold.' A week after the robbery of the British registered lorry on a Belgian motorway last October, Mancini and Gale were pulled over by traffic police as they headed for a Channel port. Essex: David Chatwood, stepdad to TOWIE sisters Sam and Billie Faiers, was in on robbery plot . But the court had earlier heard the . plot was 'doomed to failure' because some of the gang were being watched . by British police and they were all soon rounded up. When stripped searched by an officer she tried to conceal the bars in her folded up bra placed in an examination box. It was only when the officer picked up the bra to examine it that the bars fell out, it was claimed. Her partner Gale has admitted being part of a gang who planned the heist of gold and silver bullion from the back of a lorry in Belgium driven by gang member Brian Mulcahay.

Mancini is standing trial along with John Corley, 52, and father and son Andreas and Kayracos Nicolas, 50 and 30. They all deny the charges against them. Corley declined to give evidence while Andreas and Kyriacos Nicolas, said to be wealthy import/exporters, told the court they were approached by Corley about buying gold. But the alleged deal was never done because they expected scrap gold and the men selling the bullion failed to produce paperwork to prove they owned it. The trial continues.

His booming voice has been heard by thousands of visitors to a market town in North Yorkshire for the last six years. So it is perhaps a little fitting that a town crier who was sacked for allegedly boozing while on duty has refused to go quietly. Kevin Griffiths was shown the door after he called a councillor 'an idiot' and was accused of going drinking in Skipton's pubs dressed in full official regalia. Refusing to go quietly: Town crier Kevin Griffiths has vowed to carry on bell-ringing - despite his licence being revoked by the council . However the 58-year-old has refused to be silenced, instead going 'rogue' and vowing to carry on bell-ringing - despite his licence being revoked by Skipton Town Council. He is now seeking alternative backing - from Skipton Castle as Lord of the Manor or one of the local churches who can appoint their own bellmen. Failing that, he says he will act in his other capacity as town crier for Bradford. He said: 'If necessary, I will act as an independent crier and will fight for my rights in court.' However, the town council’s withdrawal of support does mean he will not defend his position as National Champion at Hastings in two weeks’ time. Mr Griffiths, who has been Skipton's town crier since 2006, added: 'The town council used to give me £500 in expenses and I used that to cover the costs. Without it, I can’t compete.' Familiar face... and voice: Mr Griffiths has been a town crier in Skipton since 2006 . He described the town council’s decision as totally and utterly ridiculous and claimed he was the victim of a personal vendetta. He said: 'All the people in the town are behind me; it’s just the council. They have got rid of me for doing my job.' At issue has been his use of Craven District Council’s town centre car park, where he meets coaches and advises visitors where they can get refreshments. It is claimed it is a breach of bylaws which prevent commercial activity on council land. The matter was discussed by the town council behind closed doors on Thursday. The authority acted after 'numerous complaints, over a lengthy period of time' relating to Mr Griffiths’ behaviour, a spokesman. Complaints centred on claims that he had promoted local businesses while standing in a council car park, a breach of a local byelaw. He also got into trouble for calling a councillor an 'idiot' during an argument, which he had admitted. Councillors also looked into allegations that Mr Griffiths had been drinking while dressed for the role. Mr Griffiths, a former fireman, said he had not been treated fairly because the allegations about drinking had not been put to him. He said: 'The meetings have been held behind closed doors and these allegations (about drinking) are the first I have heard. How can I defend against that?' Mr Griffiths said he would sometimes have 'four or five pints' in the pub but only after his town crier shift had ended, adding: 'I am conscious of the fact that I am wearing the livery and I would not get smashed out of my skull be-cause it’s an insult to the Queen.' Silenced for good? The rogue crier said he would sometimes have 'four or five pints' in the pub but only after his shift had ended . He said he was self-employed and therefore not 'on duty' when he was in the pub. He believes businesses complained about him promoting one establishment over another but he denied any bias. A . council statement said: 'Skipton Town Council has withdrawn its . permission for Mr Kevin Reid Griffiths to act in the capacity of town . crier to the parish of Skipton. 'The council has been in receipt of numerous complaints, over a lengthy period of time, relating to activities being undertaken by Mr Griffiths while acting as town crier. 'The quantity of complaints received, together with the repeated refusal to adhere to the reasonable requests and instructions of the council, and a failure to follow the rules of membership of the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers has made the position untenable. 'The position of town crier to Skipton is an honorary position in the gift of Skipton Town Council. 'At a meeting of the full council, held on September 20, members discussed the situation in full, including the complaints received by the council and the responses from Mr Griffiths to requests made previously by the council in an attempt to find a constructive way forward. 'The decision of members was to revoke the town council’s consent for Mr Griffiths to act as Skipton Town Crier, with immediate effect.'","Kevin Griffiths was shown the door following a string of complaints .

The Prime Minister – in New York for a United Nations meeting – was tripped up by a general knowledge quiz on on David Letterman’s Late Show last night. After getting the composer of Rule Britannia wrong and being unable to translate Magna Carta, Mr Cameron confessed: 'I’m a history obsessive, so I’m sorry I didn’t do better.' Scroll down to watch . Making a point: After an apparently warm welcome, David Cameron is grilled by U.S chat show king David Letterman on British history, which left him squirming in his seat . Whoops: Mr Cameron was asked who composed Rule Britannia, to which he wrongly replied Edward Elgar . Asked today how he rated his performance on . the Letterman show, Mr Cameron added: 'I think, when I get home and do my children’s homework, maybe I need to sit down and do a little bit extra myself.' It had all started so well. The house . band played Rule Britannia as he walked on stage and dry ice was pumped . into the studio to replicate a London fog. But . the apparently warm welcome quickly turned into a trap as Mr Letterman, . famed for his acerbic wit, tested Mr Cameron with questions on British . history. Asked who composed Rule Britannia, Mr Cameron replied: ‘You are testing me there. Elgar, I will go for.’ In fact, as Mr Letterman later gleefully revealed, the music was written by Thomas Arne to a poem by James Thomson. The Prime Minister did better on the Magna Carta, correctly answering that it was signed in 1215 at Runnymede.

But, despite his Eton education, he was stumped when asked for a literal translation of the Latin – Great Charter. ‘It would be good if you knew this,’ Mr Letterman said. ‘Yes, it would,’ the Prime Minister replied. ‘You’ve found me out. I’ve ended my career on your show tonight!’ The gentle mickey-taking continued with a series of questions about the British empire and the difference between Wales and England. He correctly identified the population of Britain and the countries that make up the UK. Mr Cameron was also asked whether he was popular in the UK, replying: ‘Not very popular, no. We have got this budget deficit – we have to make difficult decisions and that makes you unpopular.’ And he was quizzed about Larry, the Downing Street cat, who he admitted was a ‘terrible mouser’. But despite the ribbing, Mr Cameron . will have been pleased to have got over at least part of his message . about the success of the Olympics and the attractiveness of the British . economy. He also underlined the fact that Britain is not in the troubled eurozone. Straphanger: Mr Cameron braved the New York City subway on his way to addresses the UN General . In the Big Apple: Mr Cameron walks through the streets of Midtown Manhattan after addressing the UN General Assembly . He said the economic outlook would ‘probably be worse’ if we were in the euro, adding: ‘In Europe if you are going to have a single currency you are going to end up with some form of single government – I don’t want that for Britain.’ In appearing on the show, Mr Cameron was following in the footsteps of Tony Blair, Boris Johnson and Barack Obama. The PM was given top billing at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York, sharing the bill with British folk rock band Mumford and Sons. Packed schedule: Earlier in the day, Mr Cameron, addressed the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly . Aides insisted Mr Cameron had done only light preparation for the interview. Broad answers were prepared on issues like the Olympics, his relationship with the Queen and his views on the US presidential race. Sources said the PM had been braced for the fact that Letterman would crack jokes at his expense, but felt it was worth it if the interview would give him the chance to broadcast a positive message about the UK economy. A Government source said: ‘Britain has had an extraordinary year. We have got something good to shout about. So getting out there talking up Britain is important. We should never forget that we are the biggest investor in America, America is the biggest investor in us. ‘There is a saying in business that when you want to do better, you go back to your biggest customers and try and squeeze out a bit more.’ 'History of the UK for Dummies’ by David Cameron . By LARISA BROWN . The Prime Minister yesterday turned his hand to giving a history lesson. But he proved it is not his best subject. Despite his Eton-education, he stumbled on the answers to ‘dumb American questions’ on British history. He perhaps should have guessed after . he entered David Letterman's Late Show to the strains of Rule Britannia, . that the first topic of conversation might be the British Empire. Asked about the countries which make . up the British Empire, the Prime Minister responded: ‘It is not an . empire it is the UK. Think of the United States. The United Kingdom of . England, Scotland, Wales…’ Then, . like a school teacher in a classroom being quizzed by youngsters, Mr . Cameron continued to describe the United Kingdom in a simplistic form, . using a variety of hand gestures as an aid to his explanations. Question: What is the deal on Wales? David Cameron: ‘It is part of the UK. It is a small country but a very proud people.’ Question: ‘How are the Welsh different from the English?’ David Cameron: ‘Well . there are people in wales who speak a different language, who speak . welsh as their first language but they are very much part of the United . Kingdom.’ Question: What is the difference between Northern Ireland and Ireland? David Cameron: ‘There was a time when all of Ireland was part of the UK. ‘There . was then a movement for Irish independence and when that happened the . north of Ireland decided it wanted to stay with the United Kingdom so we . have the United Kingdom including Scotland, Wales, England and Northern . Ireland. ‘And the . Republic of Ireland is a separate country not in the United Kingdom, . don’t make that mistake.  But we have very good relations between the .

David Cameron: ‘It is very complicated, there is huge amount of history involved in this. ‘It . is partly based on some religious differences but the majority of people . who live in Northern Ireland, including both Protestants and Catholics, . want to be, a majority want to be, part of the United Kingdom. ‘So . we had a big peace agreement which was all about respecting the rights . of people in Northern Ireland to determine their own future. ‘And now relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are incredibly good. ‘Her .

Controversial: Chancellor George Osborne decided to increase VAT on hot baked goods to raise more money . The so-called 'pasty tax' comes into force today amid warnings that it could tip struggling businesses 'over the brink'. Chancellor George Osborne originally announced plans to raise £110 million by levying 20 per cent VAT on hot baked goods at the Budget. The move prompted a huge outcry, with critics accusing ministers of waging class warfare against pasty eaters. Mr Osborne later staged a partial climbdown by exempting products that are left to return to 'ambient temperatures' on shelves in bakeries and supermarkets. The concession is estimated to have cost the Treasury around £40 million. However, there is still anger that food kept warm for customers - in hot cabinets at bakeries, burger vans, or chestnut stalls - will attract the full tax. Greg Mayne of accountancy firm Reeves said: 'The VAT rise will impact on revenue for already struggling businesses and may tip some over the brink at a time when many people are cutting back on their discretionary spending, particularly eating out. 'This is going to hurt hot food sellers and may prove too much for some to survive. 'The message to traders, whether they are selling pasties from a shop or hot chestnuts from a stall, is, 'Don't bury your head in the sand' and ignore the VAT. 'Many places are suddenly going to find they should be charging VAT from next week and could face significant fines if they fail to do so.'

The sports chain has been lurching from crisis to crisis over the past year, struggling with massive debts and low profits, as well as competition from rival Sports Direct and online retailers. It was forced to call in administrators who closed 133 stores after failing to find a buyer. One crisis too far: Around 2,200 shop workers were laid off after JJB Sports became the latest high street retailer to collapse . Sports Direct had been in talks to rescue the majority of the business, but accountants KMPG said it would buy only 20 stores, securing 550 jobs, and the website. Richard Fleming, of KPMG, said: ‘The level of cash ... required to rescue a more substantial part of the business was too much risk for most interested parties.’ Large high street chains have been bearing the brunt of the downturn, hurt by high rent bills, the rising cost of stock, and less cash coming through the tills as shoppers rein in their spending. Rival: Newcastle owner Mike Ashley's Sports Direct had been in talks to rescue the majority of JJB, but later said it would only buy 20 stores and the website . In July JJB’s chief executive Keith Jones stepped down after the company issued a string of warnings over profits and debts of £36million. It said it had approached its suppliers and partners for more cash, months after securing a deal aimed at shoring up the business. US retailer Dick’s Sporting Goods had thrown JJB a £20million lifeline which was supposed to last it until the end of the year.

Judge Nigel Gilmour says messages posted on Facebook are fuelling more violent crimes . Messages left on Facebook are the cause of an increasing number of violent crimes because people post comments they would not make in person, says a judge. Judge Nigel Gilmour, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, raised his concerns about the social network site after hearing the case of 17-year-old Daniel Cannon who bit off part of his friend's ear. Cannon admitted using 'his teeth as a weapon' to carry out the assault after an argument on Facebook escalated into violence. The judge said Facebook messages left by Cannon’s brother -  which he described as  'absolutely disgraceful and centred on threats of violence' - had provoked the attack. In passing sentence he added: 'It is remarkable when people are communicating on Facebook that they say things they would not say face to face.' 'We are increasingly getting in court instances beginning on Facebook, it is becoming more and more. Daniel Cannon, was spared a . custodial sentence after pleading guilty to sinking his teeth into the . left ear of a friend during an early morning fight in a corridor at St .

Liverpool Crown Court heard Cannon . got embroiled in a fight after 'disgraceful, pathetic and violent' exchanges between his brother and the victim. The judge added: 'I had an opportunity to look at the Facebook (comments)  and it can be said that the defendant’s brother is responsible for Daniel Cannon being in the dock. Judge Nigel Gilmour raised his concerns about Facebook after hearing the case of 17-year-old Daniel Cannon who bit off part of his friend's ear . 'It would have been appropriate if your brother could be in court today 'It was disgraceful, pathetic, juvenile behaviour - messages some of which were deeply offensive and of a violent nature. 'If your mother has not had the opportunity (to read them) then I hope she is given it, so she can understand why it is I say a great deal of responsibility for you being in the dock lies at the feet of your brother.' Sentencing, Judge Nigel Gilmour, who allowed Cannon to be named despite him being under 18, said the motor mechanic student had 'a rush of blood to the head' while he and the victim were grappling in a brawl. Ben Morris, defending, added: 'People seem to see what is going on on Facebook on the internet as a kind of different form of reality than what is going on in a personal exchange.' Liverpool Crown Court heard violence broke out shortly after 8am on Wednesday, March 7 following a fall out over comments posted on Facebook the previous evening, mainly between the teenaged victim and Cannon’s brother, Paul. Liverpool Crown Court heard that Daniel Cannon got embroiled in a fight after 'disgraceful, pathetic and violent' exchanges between his brother and the victim . Cannon who admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent, says he bit the 17-year-old victim’s left ear to break free from a bear hug he was locked in. Sentencing, Judge Nigel Gilmour said: 'Having got involved in a fight with someone you described as a friend, you were getting the worse of the fight and then bit off part of the ear of the victim. 'You did not intend to cause really serious injury (but) I have no doubt you intended to cause acute pain with a view to bringing the fight to an end.' Judge Gilmour told Cannon, who was 16 at the time of the assault, that if he had been an adult he would have been sent to prison. However, given his age and his early guilty plea, the judge sentenced him to an 18-month supervision order and 150 hours unpaid work. He will also have to complete a victim empathy and violent offender programme. Judge Gilmour's comments follow similar statements by Judge Bopa-Rai at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court last month. He said: 'Facebook is causing more hassle than anything else these days,' after sentencing a man who punched a woman in the face following an exchange of messages on the site. An upcoming Government defamation bill will aim to tackle online abuse and harassment which has become known as 'trolling'. However the impact of provisions in the bill which require sites to reveal anonymous culprits on Facebook are expected to be minimal as the company already requires its member to post under their real names.","Judge's comments come after messages left on Facebook escalated into violent attack on teenager .

"By . James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 09:53 EST, 2 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:33 EST, 3 October 2012 . Hate preacher Abu Hamza is ill because he can’t get enough sleep in his ‘harsh’ prison cell, his lawyers complained yesterday. They want judges to halt his extradition to the US so he can have an MRI scan to establish if he is fit to travel. It is the latest legal delaying tactic in a case which has already taken eight years and cost the British taxpayer more than £1million. 'Deteriorating health': Abu Hamza asked the High Court to grant him time for an MRI scan as he renewed a long-running legal battle to halt his extradition from the UK to the US . If the High Court rejects the appeal, . the hook-handed Islamist fanatic could finally be on a plane to America – . where he is wanted for running a terrorist training camp – by the . middle of the month. Hamza’s previous argument that it . would be a breach of his human rights to imprison him for decades in a . US jail was rejected by judges in Strasbourg last week. Now he has changed tactics by saying . he has ‘deteriorating health’ and it would be ‘oppressive’ to kick him . out in his condition. In papers before two judges in London, Hamza’s QC, . Alun Jones, argues there is ‘medical opinion that a [MRI] scan is . medically necessary’. The QC says a judge referred to Hamza’s ‘very poor health’ at an extradition hearing in 2008. The papers continue: ‘Over four years . later, it appears there has been, or may have been, a further . deterioration, perhaps attributable to sleep deprivation and the . continued confinement of the appellant in an unrelentingly harsh . environment.’ The QC said Home Secretary Theresa May . had been asked in August for a scan to take place in jail, but the . request had been ‘ignored’. Legal fight: Hamza's QC Alun Jones appealed to the High Court (pictured) that Hamza's deteriorating health might be caused by sleep deprivation . Hamza lost his arms and one eye on what he claims was a de-mining mission in Afghanistan. An MRI scan can determine if a patient has musculoskeletal or bone problems. Mr Jones admits in his written . submissions that, after further medical tests are carried out and . considered by doctors on both sides, ‘there may be no issue’. But he insisted that at present ‘it . cannot possibly be said there is no issue’. He is expected to make more . submissions on Hamza’s behalf today, before judges reach a verdict on . whether to grant an injunction, delaying his removal. The judges are also considering . challenges by Babar Ahmad, Syed Ahsan, Khaled Al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul . Bary, all of whom are wanted by the US authorities on terrorism charges. None of the men was in court . yesterday. Hamza was recently moved from Belmarsh jail, in South London, . to Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, where the others are held.

The Nokia Lumia 900 was meant to be the Finnish phone makers triumphant return to the smartphone market - but Nokia has been forced to cut its price by half just weeks after launch . It was hailed as the phone with which Nokia would finally challenge the dominance of the iPhone and Galaxy S. But the Finnish phone maker has been forced to cut the price of its Lumia 900 by half just weeks after launch. The cost of the Lumia 900 Windows phone . in the US has now been reduced to $49.99 from $99 with a two-year contract, Nokia spokesman Keith Nowak said on Sunday. After being the main player in the mobile market for the best part of a decade, Nokia has failed to produce a smartphone to compete with those from rivals such as Apple, Samsung and HTC. The company was criticised for being late to embrace smartphones and has been lagging . behind ever since. It has also been losing market share in less . expensive mobile phones. So its alliance with Microsoft - the phones run Windows software - was meant to rejuvenate the company. But it has failed to capture the public imagination so far. Nokia's phone is sold at AT&T Inc stores.Nowak said the price cut 'is part of our ongoing lifecycle management, which is jointly done between Nokia and carrier customers'. Featuring a 4.3-inch screen, 1.4-gigahertz processor and 8-megapixel camera, the Lumia 900 uses largely untried software from Microsoft Corp. Sales have been slow, and Nokia took a further hit when Microsoft said current phones will be unable to run its new Windows 8 software, rendering them obsolete. Last month, Nokia said it would cut 10,000 jobs, and that its handset business would post a larger-than-expected quarterly loss. All three major credit rating agencies have downgraded Nokia to 'junk' status. Triumphant return? Nokia's alliance with Microsoft - its new smartphones run Windows software - was meant to rejuvenate the company, but has failed to capture the public imagination so far . Smartphones using Google Inc's Android system are expected to comprise 61 per cent of the global market in 2012, while Apple's iPhone could capture more than 20 per cent, International Data Corp said last month. Nokia is expected to report second-quarter results on July 19. Shares of Nokia closed on Friday at 1.51 euros, after earlier in the week falling to their lowest since the mid-1990s. Nokia is to cut 10,000 jobs worldwide by the end of next year as it fights fierce competition in the smartphone market. Nokia's Lumia 800 smartphone runs Windows slick Windows Phone 7 operating system, and offers a luxurious-feeling black touchscreen, built-in Office compatibility and Xbox games . The Nokia Lumia 710 handset (pictured) is priced just £234, but offers much of the same smartphone functions as the pricier 800 . Nokia's Lumia's are an alliance between Nokia and . Microsoft - the touchscreen phone runs Microsoft's simple, . good-looking Windows Phone 7 software. Both companies are relying on Lumia to catapult them back into competition with rivals iPhone and Android. So far, Microsoft's Windows software has failed to make an impact, and Nokia's market share has been steadily dwindling. When . current CEO Stephen Elop took over the company, he likened Nokia's . situation to a man standing on a 'burning oil platform' - with the . choices of staying and burning alive or leaping into the sea. Lumia is the 'leap into the sea' - an alliance with Microsoft to propel Nokia's handsets back into the limelight. Lumia is cheaper than iPhone, and simpler than Android. It also works with Microsoft Office documents, and has Xbox games built in. The . design is pure high-end Nokia smartphone, with a moulded polycarbonate . exterior and a Carl Zeiss lens that has already drawn admiring reviews . from tech blogs. The Finnish mobile maker said the cuts were part of plans to ‘significantly reduce its operating expenses’ as it aims to return to profitable growth by sharpening strategy and improving its operating model. The company warned that second-quarter loss from its phone business would be larger than expected. Nokia said it remains focused on its smartphones and feature phones and intends to expand location-based services. It aims to differentiate its portfolio of Lumia smartphones with location-based services including navigation and visual search applications, such as the Nokia city Lens.","Credit agencies downgrade Nokia shares to 'junk' status .

An NBC executive producer has jumped into the controversy surrounding the firing of former Today show co-anchor Ann Curry, saying that it was him - and not Matt Lauer - who made the decision to cut her loose. Jim Bell has been with NBC since 1990, but in 2005 became the executive producer of Today, which has been marred in recent weeks by diving ratings following Curry’s departure in June. Reports hinted that Curry’s firing was orchestrated by Lauer as part of a deal to extend his contract, claims that Bell calls 'absolutely not true.' In charge: Today executive producer Jim Bell, center, is pictured with Meredith Vieira, Ann Curry, Matt Lauer, and Bryant Gumbel earlier this year . Bell told The New York Times' Media Decoder blog: 'It was definitely not Matt’s call. He is the host and does not have management responsibility. It was not his call. That was my call.' Viewership has been slipping away from the Today show as rival Good Morning America has been gaining ground, winning the ratings war for the past two weeks. Early data shows that the ABC morning show will most likely win for a third week, as well. Additionally, in the 10 weeks before Curry left, Today got 4.94 million viewers, but in the 10 weeks since she left there were just 4.6 million. Trouble at Today? NBC is reportedly examining whether Matt Lauer, left, is worth what he's being paid after the show took a major hit in rating following the tearful departure of Ann Curry, right . The moment Lauer lost his likability? Curry's unceremonious booting off the show has long been a thorn in Lauer's side, after it was claimed he was responsible for getting her axed . As Today’s ratings decline in the wake . of Curry’s departure, reports have swirled that Lauer has morphed into . something of a monster on the set. Sources told the New York Post’s Page . Six last week that Lauer is now 'running the show and he’s not listening . to anyone,' causing a 'huge problem.' Birthdate: July 20, 1967 . Hometown: Branford, Connecticut . Education: B.A. in government, Harvard. Played football as a defensive linebacker . Marital status: Married with four sons . Work history: Joined NBC out of college in 1990 to profile athletes for 1992 Barcelona Olympics; became coordinating producer and programming supervisor for NBC Olympics; producer for NBC broadcasts of the NFL, MLB, and the NBA; joined Today in 2005 as executive producer; won Emmys for his work on 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2002 Olympics . Responding to the report, Bell told . The Times: 'Matt is the heart and soul of the broadcast. He has a heart . of gold. This stuff about him has been very irresponsible and in a lot . of cases flat-out wrong.' Bell spoke out amid rumours that NBC is examining whether Lauer is worth his $25million salary as Today ratings tank. A source close to the situation told Radar Online: 'Matt Lauer will be asked to take a significant cut in his $25million salary if TODAY doesn't win the key November sweeps.' 'The May and November sweeps dictate . how much the networks can charge for advertising and they are extremely . important to the bottom line. The TODAY show had always been a cash cow . for NBC, generating hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.' Radar reported that NBC Universal is . now looking at the budgets of the network’s shows, and seeing where cuts . can be made, and in the news division, a significant portion pays . Lauer's salary. Bell told The Times that those reports 'could not be more wrong.'

A ‘treasure trove’ of more than 100 extremely rare classic cars - including Porsches, Triumphs and a Ford Model T - will be sold off unless their mystery owner comes forward to claim them. The fleet of 105 rare British and American vehicles were abandoned at a mansion in Biddulph Park, Staffordshire, last July when the tenant was evicted for not paying the rent. It includes British classics such as the Jensen Interceptor, built in West Bromwich; a Humber Sceptre, made by the now-defunct Rootes Group; a Humber Super Snipe and two Triumph Stags. Scroll down for video . Rarities: The fleet of 105 rare British and American vehicles were abandoned at a mansion in Biddulph Park, Staffordshire, last July when the tenant was evicted for not paying the rent . There is also a Porsche 911, a Model T dating back almost a century, two Italian Lancia Fulvias, a German NSU sports car, Mini and Morris Minor pick-ups, a Cortina soft top, and an Escort RS 2000. Now businessman Mark Greaves, who owns the land, says unless the cars' owner stumps up the £108,990 bill for storing them, he will auction them all off to recoup his money. Mr Greaves, managing director at flooring firm Flowcrete in Sandbach, Cheshire, said: ‘We had a tenant in the property who was evicted for non-payment. ‘To start with there were about 140 cars, but I think he took the best of them with him. He was interested in vintage cars and became a bit of a collector, but he left the majority of them behind.’ Impressive: The fleet includes British classics such as the Jensen Interceptor, built in West Bromwich; a Humber Sceptre, made by the now-defunct Rootes Group; a Humber Super Snipe and two Triumph Stags . The Model T Ford was launched in Detroit in 1908. With a 10-gallon tank and optimum fuel consumption of 20 miles per gallon, it changed the car industry by popularising private cars for everyday use. Drivers used a level and a pedal to change gears, plus another pedal for reverse. There was no clutch and the throttle was found where motorists would see modern indicators. Mr Greaves is refurbishing the property to rent out again and is keen to remove the vehicles. Most of the cars have been kept indoors, with 68 put in storage and the other 37 left in a field outside. Motoring expert John Swift said: ‘This is a treasure trove of classic cars. If they are auctioned enthusiasts from around the country will be flocking to the sale. ‘To find a collection that includes such rarities as a couple of Triumph Stags, Mini and Morris Minor pick-ups, a Cortina soft top, and what might yet prove to be an Escort RS 2000 and so many others is just amazing. ‘Someone could be sitting on a fortune. It depends on the condition of the cars, but I can see this collectively bringing a six-figure amount.

In order to move the vehicles legally, Mr Greaves has been forced to put out a public notification to inform the owner of his plans to sell them unless they are claimed by December 19. He said: ‘I thought he had taken the vehicles of most value. I gave him lots of time to come and collect them. I sent emails and made phone calls but so far I have heard nothing back. ‘If they remain unclaimed we will look at auctioning them off as one group or selling them to a dealer.’","Fleet of 105 rare British and American vehicles abandoned at a mansion .

"By . Ted Thornhill . UPDATED: . 13:50 EST, 29 December 2011 . China plans to launch space labs and manned ships and prepare to build space stations over the next five years, according to a plan released today that shows the country's space program is gathering momentum. China has already said its eventual goals are to have a space station and put an astronaut on the moon. It has made methodical progress with its ambitious lunar and human spaceflight programs, but its latest five-year plan beginning next year signals an acceleration. By the end of 2016, China will launch space laboratories, manned spaceship and ship freighters, and make technological preparations for the construction of space stations, according to the white paper setting out China's space progress and future missions. Making progress: A rocket carrying the unmanned spacecraft Shenzhou 8 blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China's Gansu Province last month . China's space program has already made major breakthroughs in a relatively short time, although it lags far behind the United States and Russia in space technology and experience. The country will continue exploring the moon using probes, start gathering samples of the moon's surface, and ‘push forward its exploration of planets, asteroids and the sun.’ It will use spacecraft to study the properties of black holes and begin monitoring space debris and small near-Earth celestial bodies and build a system to protect spacecraft from debris. Aiming high: China's first moon orbiter, Chang'e 1, lifts off from the launch pad at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan province in 2007 . The paper also says China will improve its launch vehicles, improve its communications, broadcasting and meteorological satellites and develop a global satellite navigation system, intended to rival the United States' dominant GPS network. China places great emphasis on the development of its space industry, which is seen as a symbol of national prestige. Its space principles - including peaceful development, enhancing international cooperation and deep space exploration - are largely unchanged from its previous two documents detailing the progress of China's space missions, released in 2000 and 2006. Nasa is the space agency with the best kit and the most know-how - and in the next two years will be launching two remarkable missions. NuSTAR - March 2012It’s . not that long until NuSTAR – or Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array - . is launched, which is a hi-tech black hole hunter. It will scan the . skies using high energy X-rays and provide astronomers with a census of . the mysterious phenomena. Its . sensors will also be used to analyse the debris from recently exploded . stars to understand how they die and how elements are created. MAVEN - late 2013Nasa is making preparations for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission – . ‘devoted to understanding the Martian upper atmosphere’. The . space agency hopes to discover where the Martian atmosphere and water . disappeared to. One of its key objectives will be to measure the rate . the current atmosphere is escaping at. In 2003, China became the third country behind the U.S. and Russia to launch a man into space and, five years later, completed a spacewalk. Toward the end of this year, it demonstrated automated docking between its Shenzhou 8 craft and the Tiangong 1 module, which will form part of a future space laboratory. In 2007, it launched its first lunar probe, Chang'e-1, which orbited the moon, collecting data and a complete map of the moon. Since 2006, China's Long March rockets have successfully launched 67 times, sending 79 spacecraft into orbit. Some elements of China's program, notably the firing of a ground-based missile into one of its dead satellites four years ago, have alarmed American officials and others who say such moves could set off a race to militarise space. That the program is run by the military has made the U.S. reluctant to cooperate with China in space, even though the latter insists its program is purely for peaceful ends. ‘China always adheres to the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes weaponisation or any arms race in outer space,’ today’s white paper states. The Chinese government's policy is to ‘reinforce’ space cooperation with developing countries and ‘value’ space cooperation with developed countries. The paper lists cooperation between China and countries including Russia, Brazil, France and Britain, and says of the United States: Nasa's director visited China ‘and the two sides will continue to make dialogue regarding the space field.’ Seeing the big picture: Scientists work at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center . Up, up and away: Putting a man on the Moon is a key objective for China .",By 2016 China will launch space laboratories and manned craft and cargo vessels .

Masked pickaxe-wielding bandits made off with an estimated $2 million in precious gems and gold from a mining museum in California during a brazen daytime robbery on Friday. At least two men violently threatened workers and corralled visitors into a corner at Mariposa's Mining and Minerals Museum before attempting to snatch their prized Fricot Nugget that weighs nearly 14lbs. Despite tripping an alarm that closed the doors to the famed crystalline gold’s vaulted room the men were able to escape while taking with them several other valuable items from smashed cases, the California Highway Patrol said. Scroll down for video . Under attack: California's Mining and Mineral Museum reported losing approximately $2 million in gold and other gems after two masked men stormed the display cases with pickaxes . Prized possession: The Fricot Nugget weighing 13.8 pounds is the largest remaining intact mass of crystalline gold dating back to the California gold rush but was nearly stolen on Friday . The news of the historic nugget's thwarted robbery attempt, the largest remaining intact mass of crystalline gold discovered in the Gold Rush era, was the sole good news for the museum that approximated losing millions in other gems with no suspects identified. The two museum employees who were onsite during the crime were not injured, but they remained shaken from the experience, the California Department of Parks and Recreation, which operates the facility, said in a news release. Officials have closed the museum while they repair display cases and other items damaged by the robbers. Meanwhile, the parks department was busy conducting an inventory of the stolen items. The heist was more bad news for the beleaguered museum, which is home to more than 13,000 artefacts.

It was previously on a state list of facilities being considered for closure to help save money by the end of July. In a miraculous safe, on July 20th the Parks Department presented $54 million previously unreported to budget officials according to the Los Angeles Times, keeping them at least temporarily open. Authorities said the unique pieces taken would be easily identified, which could make it difficult for the robbers to sell. - James Hutchings of the Roseville Rock Rollers . 'It is uncommon for most citizens to possess such minerals,' the CHP said in a statement. Despite this there's a fear the crooks would melt them down, entirely ruining their historical valuable.

'It would be a matter of seconds to take a very large nugget and turn it into a nugget of melted gold,' he said. It was the second heist this year of rare, valuable metals in Northern California.

Judge David Fletcher told Murphy, 35, that 'blackmail is one of the most vicious crimes in the calendar of wicked . offences. It is appalling behaviour, vicious and nasty.' He added: 'I don’t know if you really . appreciate the way in which you wrecked the lives of these young girls.' Murphy, pretending to be a good looking teenager, convinced his victims to reveal parts of their body via a webcam, and having complied, he then used the footage to obtain further images. He told the sister of one . 13-year-old victim in Massachusetts, who had begged him to stop after bombarding the siblings with Facebook messages, ‘If you trying to prey on my . conscience, I haven’t got one.’ And after the pair had ignored his demands, he forwarded a video of the younger sibling showing her naked breasts to her mother, friends as well as her school. He posed as a good-looking teenager on the site BlogTV where he managed to convince girls to send him naked photos . In conversations with other perverts . on line he referred to his victims as 'cam whores' and it was apparent . they spent their time searching on websites to capture indecent images . of girls, he said. Victim impact statements revealed how . the 13-year-old had had to have counselling and her personality had . changed and her confidence shattered. She lost a lot of friends and had . to change schools and her frightened sister and mother had also been . devastated by Murphy’s activities. Murphy had been using a Facebook . account under the name of John Reeves but following a joint operation . between the FBI in Boston, Merseyside Police Abusive Images unit, CEOP . and Facebook he was identified. When police raided his home in Rock Ferry, last November, they examined his . computers and as well as evidence of his blackmailing activity they . found more than 2,000 indecent photographs and videos of children. He had been distributing some of the . disgusting images and chatting to like minded perverts on line, said . Christopher Hopkins, prosecuting. Mr Hopkins told Liverpool Crown Court . that the 13-year-old had innocently chatted on a website called ‘Blog . TV’ . Murphy was jailed to six years in jail at Liverpool Crown Court after pleading guilty to three offences of blackmail and a further 26 offences of downloading and distributing indecent images . He requested her and her sister as . Facebook friends and then 'utterly despicably' sent hundreds of abusive . and threatening messages to them for three months demanding more such . images. The distraught girls refused and . pretending to be her sent the video footage to her friends and posted a . link to her school’s website naming her and saying 'I am a whore , I . strip for money'. He had uploaded the video to file sharing website and . it is now in the public domain for ever, said Mr Hopkins. Judge Fletcher added: 'During the months of August, September . and October 2010 you caused havoc in the lives of a number of people . thousands of miles away through your use of the internet to use it to . target girls, obtaining indecent images and then proceeding to blackmail . them.' Fragments of conversation retrieved . from his computer revealed similar behaviour with two other young girls, . including sending an indecent video of one of them to her friend with a . link to a sharing website. After the hearing Dc Dave Gregson, . from Merseyside Police Abusive Images Unit said, 'This investigation . shows that Merseyside Police in conjunction with partner agencies such . as Facebook, FBI and Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre will . continue to investigate the online activities of individuals engaged in . pedophiliac activity on the internet. 'The clear message is that is to . be sent out here is that however someone tries to hid their identity . they can be found and will be brought to the attention of the courts.' Paul Wood, defending, said that . Murphy, who has a previous conviction for nuisance phone calls, accepts . his behaviour had had grave consequences. He was ordered to sign the Sex . Offenders Register for life and the judge made a Sexual Offences . Prevention Order banning him from unsupervised contact with girls under . 16 and limiting his internet access.","Told his victims ‘If you trying to prey on my .

The body of a British schoolgirl raped and murdered in Goa can finally be buried four years after her death - following claims of a communication blunder by Indian authorities and the Foreign Office. Scarlett Keeling, 15, was sexually assaulted and left for dead on a beach in the Indian holiday state in February 2008 after taking a cocktail of drugs. Months later, following two post-mortem tests in Goa, her body was brought back to Britain but has lain in a mortuary at an Exeter hospital amid the ongoing trial of two men charged over her death. Long wait: The body of Scarlett Keeling, left, who was raped and murdered in 2008, will be buried on June 17 - which would have been her 20th birthday. Her mother, Fiona MacKeown, right, said she was relieved but angry . A third pathology examination was carried out three years ago following a request by Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland. But the Foreign Office have only now informed the coroner that Goan authorities have given the green light for the body to be released. It is not known when Goa granted permission. But Scarlett's mother Fiona MacKeown believes a lack of communication between the two governments led to a delay. The schoolgirl, who had been left with a 25-year-old Indian boyfriend while her mother travelled with her six other children, will be buried near the family’s rural home in Brandiworthy. Home: The site in Brandiworthy, Devon where Scarlett once lived and will soon be buried near . Anjuna Beach: The idyllic spot where Scarlett was raped and murdered in February 2008 . A funeral will be held on June 17th - which would have been Scarlett’s 20th birthday. Mrs . MacKeown, who claims Goan authorities engaged in a cover-up to prevent . the beach paradise’s ‘seedy underbelly’ from being exposed, today said . she was relieved that she can finally lay her daughter to rest - but angry about the delay. She said: ‘It’s a relief to bring her home where she belongs back with us. I have been expecting it for four years but it could have been another four years.’ But she said she was ‘disgusted’ with the lack of communication between the Indian authorities and Foreign Office which meant Scarlett’s body could have been released to the family three years ago. Mrs MacKeown, 48, said the family has been through ‘a living hell’. Wayward: Scarlett pictured rolling what appears to be a cannabis joint. It was claimed that her mother allowed her to use drugs . Adventure: Scarlett, seen riding an elephant in Goa during the trip she took with her mother and six siblings . Mourning: Scarlett's family, including her former stepfather Rob Clarke, days after her death in February 2008 . The mother-of-nine, who was 100 miles . away when Scarlett died, faced allegations of neglect in Goa amid claims . that she allowed her daughter to use drugs. Scarlett, . who had been dating Indian tour guide Julio Lobo at the time of her . death, had been photographed rolling what appeared to be cannabis joint. Mrs MacKeown refused to attend the court in Goa over the claims in October 2008. But two years ago, she was hauled before Exeter Crown Court and convicted of benefits fraud and narrowly avoided jail by being handed an eight-month suspended sentence. On trial: Placido Carvalho, left, and Samson D'Souza have been charged with Scarlett's rape and murder . She had dishonestly obtained £19,500 . in child benefit payments from the taxpayer - even though her former . partner Richard Keeling was paying voluntary maintenance for three of . the children, including Scarlett. Julio Lobo: The now 29-year-old tour guide had been Scarlett's boyfriend and had been left alone with her while her mother went travelling . Scarlett . suffered 50 separate injuries in the attack in February 2008 but all . but five of those were missed at the original post mortem, which found . she drowned accidentally. Police chief Nerlon Albuquerque insisted it had been caused by Scarlett hitting her head and body on the seabed as she drowned, it was said. But a second post-mortem examination.  showed she had been raped and murdered. The Goan government’s chief pathologist said she had been held under water for five to ten minutes. Tests showed she had taken ecstasy, cocaine and LSD before her death on Anjuna beach in February 2008. Two men went on trial in Goa over Scarlett’s death. Samson D’Souza, 30, and Placido Carvalho, 42, are on trial for culpable homicide, sexual assault, outraing modesty and destrying evidence. The long running trial has still not reached a conclusion. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have provided consular assistance to the family since the start of this tragic case and we continue to do so. 'The decision to release Scarlett rests with the UK Coroner.  While we cannot interfere in the Coroner’s inquest, we will continue to do all we rightly can to assist the Coroner and the family.'","Body of Scarlett Keeling, 15, left in mortuary in Exeter since 2008 .

Apple has revealed that it is creating a 3D map of the world in direct competition with Google over online maps. The computer giant today admitted to having a fleet of planes and helicopters which have been flying over major cities around the world. It also plans to monitor iPhone owners when they drive to create live maps of traffic congestion. The maps have a special 'flyover' feature that let users virtually fly around major cities. Re-making maps: Scott Forstall, senior vice president of iOS Software at Apple Inc., demonstrates turn-by-turn navigation in iOS6 using Siri during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2012 in San Francisco, California . 'We have been flying in helicopters and planes, building up a 3D model of these places,' said Scott Forstall of Apple. Apple's move to add 3D maps comes on the heels of Google's announcement last week that it would do the same with similar technology. But Apple has aimed to one-up Google with its plans to use 'anonymous, real time data from iPhone users to keep traffic data up to date.' The traffic monitoring is part of a new satellite navigation feature in the maps app. Apple's own: A screen shot showing turn-by-turn navigation using Apple maps and Siri in iOS6 is pictured . Analysts said the decision to abandon . Google Maps, which has provided mapping data for the iPhone since it . was introduced in 2007, is the start of a 'mapping war'. Its new mobile operating software, . called iOS6 will come with a mapping system 'built from the ground up,' said Forstall, sidelining the Google map service. Previously close partners who shared . board members, Google is now Apple’s biggest challenger in the . smartphone market with its Android operating system. Facebook is getting a big boost from Apple in the wake of the social networking site's disappointing IPO, going deep into the iPhone and iPad software. With the next Apple's iOS 6 software, users will be able to update their Facebook status by talking to their phones. Users will also be able to 'Like' movies and apps in Apple's iTunes store, Apple executive Scott Forstall . said in San Francisco at Apple's annual developers' conference. Siri, Apple's voice-command . application, will add a host of new languages, including Spanish, Korean . and Mandarin Chinese, Forstall said. 'She' will also be able to launch applications and movies - all at the user's command. Apple hasn't said when iOS 6, will be available. It will run on iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches. It is also expected to release the next version of its mobile operating software, the iOS6. Apple started its Worldwide Developers' Conference touting its hardware, its biggest edge over Google. The tech giant also revamped its existing line of notebook computers. Boss: CEO Tim Cook, who took over from late co-founder Steve Jobs last August, says customers have downloaded more than 30 billion Apple apps so far .

'To create something genuinely new, . you have to start again,' said Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple's British . designer, who recently received a knighthood.

Speaking of phones, those who were anticipating the unveiling of the long-awaited iPhone 5 will have to wait longer, as Apple officials made no mention of a new mobile device. Marketing chief Phil Schiller outlined how the redesigned MacBook Air notebooks, also unveiled at the conference, will be about $100 cheaper on average than predecessors, but sport quicker Intel Corp processors. Analysts have speculated that the company will begin aggressively competing on price, gradually lowering the premium its Macs carry in general.

The accident reportedly occurred when a cable broke, causing the metal contraption to plunge 328 feet (100 metres) down the tower. All building work in Wuhan city, central China, has now been halted while the municipal government carries out security checks. Horror: Bodies lie at the foot of the lift fall where 19 people were killed at a building site in Wuhan city, China . Growing too fast? Safety is a problem in China, where more than 75,500 people died in work-related accidents last year . The tower was part of a compound where several similar structures were being erected. All of those who died were decorators working on the building, according to state broadcaster China Central Television. Work safety is a big problem in China, where regulations are routinely ignored. Although the government says it is taking measures to reduce fatalities, more than 75,500 people died in work-related accidents last year, according to the State Administration of Work Safety.

Builders called emergency services and firefighters used tools to cut off the long protruding ends of the bar, which was later removed in hospital. Incredibly, the man has recovered. Last month, three people were killed and five . injured when a motorway bridge in Heilongjiang province in north east . China collapsed, sending four huge trucks crashing 100ft to the . ground below. Fresh tragedy: Migrant workers gaze in horror at the mangled metal after the construction site lift plunged 328ft (100m) The collapse was one of a number of . horrifying accidents on China's expanding road and rail networks in . recent years - leading to fears that safety is being sacrificed for the . speed of construction.

An unemployed couple left three of their young children, all under four-years-old, home alone while they got married at a local courthouse. Kymberely Frederick and Daniel Richards now face child neglect charges after they rushed to tie the knot so Richards could avoid paying child support. Police were called to the house in Casselberry, Florida after a neighbour discovered that three of the couple’s five children were left alone in the family home, sleeping in their cribs. Children home alone: Kymberely Frederick and Daniel Richards left three of their children, under the age of four, sleeping in their cribs while they rushed to a courthouse to get married . Frederick, 30, and Richards, 34, had borrowed the neighbour’s car to get to the courthouse and later called and asked her to look out for their two older children, aged seven and eight, who would be walking home from the bus stop. The neighbour asked about the three other children, aged one, two and four, only to be told they were asleep in their cribs. She called police who arrested the pair as they arrived home. All five children were taken into custody with Child Protective Services and are now in foster care. Sleeping in their cribs: A neighbour called police after discovering that the three children were left at this house and two older children were due home while their parents were out . In court on Wednesday it was revealed that the couple told neighbours that if they did not marry by September 10, Richards would have to pay child support but neither had a job and according to their landlord, were living rent free. Richards seemed most concerned with getting a lawyer at the hearing. He said to the judge: ‘When are they coming to see me?’ The judge replied: ‘If you don’t bond out, they’ll come see you when they find the time sir. It’s not like calling a taxi.’ Avoid child support: It was revealed that the couple rushed to get married because Richards would have to pay child support if they were not wed by September 10 . Child neglect charges: Both unemployed, Frederick, pictured, and Richards now face child neglect charges and will have a custody hearing to determine whether they will get custody of their children restored . Another neighbour told WFTV.com that the couple often left their five children by themselves and it was only a matter of time until police were called. Neighbour Sylvia Galvez said: ‘It's a sad story. Very sad the kids are very sweet.’ The couple will have a custody hearing to determine whether they will get custody of their children restored. The case comes as a British two-year-old named Scarlet was left abandoned, crying in her buggy on a busy main road in Portuguese tourist town Carcavelos. Her parents were just 100 yards away ‘clearly very drunk’ according to police. Scarlet is now being looked after by social workers.

Popular: Doug Ferguson was described by one friend as a 'fantastic doctor, funny man and intellectual' A medical student who died after falling ill at an all-night party may have taken a ‘legal high’ drug, it emerged last night. Doug Ferguson, 19, was celebrating the end of his university year when he started to feel unwell. His friends called 999 in the early hours of the morning and he was taken to hospital, but doctors were unable to save him. One theory being considered by police is that he took a legal high called AMT, which can be bought cheaply online. Users experience a state of euphoria and increased energy levels. But the drug has devastating side effects, including paranoia and aggressive behaviour. The party took place at the home of Mr Ferguson’s friend Alex Pearson, 19, while his parents were away on holiday. The £500,000 detached house is close to the dead student’s family home in the affluent village of Chandler’s Ford in Hampshire.Last night a neighbour said that Mr Pearson regularly held house parties. He said that on one occasion last year residents had to call the police after 100 teenagers turned up. Yesterday Mr Ferguson’s family paid tribute to their ‘fun-loving’ son who ‘lived life to the full’. In a statement issued by the police they said: ‘We will all greatly miss him and are deeply saddened that his life should end while he was so young with what should have been a great future ahead of him. 'Talented': Mr Ferguson was a trainee doctor at the University of Bristol . ‘His sudden and unexpected death will . leave a large hole in our hearts and in our family.’ The student . attended Thornden School near his home and then gained A-grades in his . A-levels at Peter Symonds  College in Winchester. He had just finished the second year of a medical degree at the University of Bristol when he died. Friend Manny Singh Dulay, who was not at the party, said Mr Ferguson had ‘never been the kind of person to take drugs’. The 18-year-old, who is currently . studying medicine at King’s College London, said: ‘Doug had always . wanted to be a doctor. He had his heart set on it and wanted to be an . anaesthetist. ‘He was incredibly bright and could . recall a fact in a second. He had a natural talent and he was brilliant . with people. 'Doug did voluntary work at Southampton General Hospital. It . was just simple tasks like asking patients what they wanted to eat. ‘Some students just do it to look . good but Doug genuinely loved it. He loved talking to people.’ Another . friend said that Mr Pearson, a student at Brunel University, had . frantically sent texts to his friends at 6.30am asking them to come . round to the house. He said his friend was ‘really not well’ and that he . was worried. The 20-year-old friend, who did not . want to be named, said: ‘People think it is OK to take them [legal . highs], but it’s not. Doug was a very bright guy, and he would have . thought twice about taking any drugs if he knew they were illegal.’ Yesterday Mr Pearson’s parents Renfrey and Katherine refused to say if they had allowed the party to take place at their home. Mrs Pearson said: ‘Alex and Doug were good friends. It is tragic. We are in mourning.’ Maryon Stewart, whose medical student . daughter Hester died three years ago after taking party drug GBL, said: . ‘This makes me want to howl. Chemists are able to drop all these drugs . on the market to make a profit. It leaves our children vulnerable.’ Police have been unable to determine . the exact cause of Mr Ferguson’s death because toxicology tests have . been inconclusive.

Venezuela's president Hugo Chavez has declared himself fully recovered from cancer, three months before an election in which he is seeking another six-year term. 'Free, free, totally free,' he told reporters when asked if he had been given the all clear for the disease that was identified a year ago. The 57-year-old socialist leader was first diagnosed with cancer in the pelvic region in mid-2011. Healthy: Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez declared himself fully . recovered from cancer yesterday, three months before the presidential election . He wrongly declared himself cured at the end of last year before having a recurrence of the disease in February. But after repeated cycles of treatment in Cuba and Venezuela, Chavez is once again stating he is fully fit at a crucial time when his health is the main concern before the October 7 presidential vote. Perceptions of Chavez's ability to campaign for the election, and govern afterwards, are crucial among voters in what could be one of Venezuela's tightest elections of recent times. At a four-hour news conference that offered more evidence of Chavez's increasing energy levels, he promised to begin campaigning on the streets with a series of caravans in provincial Venezuela from Thursday. 'Now is when I'm stepping into the action. Our offensive begins right now!' said an ebullient Chavez, who disappeared for long periods during treatment over the last year but has been back dominating Venezuela's airwaves in recent weeks. 'Chavez is back in the street, the Bolivarian hurricane!' he added, referring to his spiritual idol and Venezuela's independence hero, Simon Bolivar. Despite Chavez's optimism, doctors say it . is impossible to be sure someone is completely cured until at least a . couple of years have passed since the last recurrence of cancer. Improving: Chavez has had repeated cycles of treatment in Cuba and . Venezuela and he is again declaring himself fully fit when his health . is the main wild card before the upcoming vote . The former soldier is leading most opinion polls by double digits, but one recent survey put him neck-and-neck with opposition candidate Henrique Capriles and up to a third of voters remain undecided. Capriles, a 39-year-old, center-left former governor, has been criss-crossing Venezuela on a 'house-by-house' tour in a show of youth and energy that the opposition has been using to contrast with the ailing Chavez, 57. The president, though, who was famous for his whirlwind on-the-street campaigning of the past, appears to be recovering his energy levels just in time. 'Every day, I feel in better physical condition and I strongly believe ... it is not going to be a determining factor in this campaign,' he told reporters. 'I'm a veteran of 100 battles and I feel in great moral, spiritual and physical conditions for this fight that is starting.'","Chavez was first diagnosed with cancer in mid-2011 .

The 12"" pepperoni pan pizza, which features a thick base, slathered with butter, two layers of cheese and toppings, boasts 2,420 calories and 130 grams of fat. It makes for a dramatic contrast with the nutritional value of its regular thin-crust version, at 910 calories and 47 grams of fat. Slice of pie: Domino's has launched a 12"" pepperoni pan pizza which boasts 2,420 calories and 130 grams of fat . The new pie also contains 43 grams more fat than a 40-piece bucket of chicken on sale at the chain and 138 more carbohydrates than an eight-piece bread basket. As far as rival chains are concerned the Domino's pan pizza, which will initially retail for $7.99, also proves to be a fattier option. Slimmers choice: The thin crust Domino's pizza is considerably less fatty than its new pan pizza option, which is baked in butter . Domino's Pan Pizza contains more calories than traditional offerings. Here we see how it's calorie and fat content compares: . It contains 500 more calories than the Original Pan . Pizza's 12"" equivalent (1,920 cals) and 420 more calories than Pizza Hut's pepperoni thick base offering (2,000 cals).

Secret Recipes, who has been cloning fast food favourites at home for . decades, the pan pizza is made by pressing dough into a well-oiled or . buttered pan, which is more similar to a cake pan than a typical pizza . pan. The pan is then covered and baked for up to 60 minutes before being topped and sprayed with a butter-flavoured product which helps achieve a golden crust.

In 1986, the butter-baked creation was introduced by chain  but many stores decided not to promote it because they took too long to prepare - the baking process can take up to two hours.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:27 EST, 7 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:29 EST, 7 September 2012 . A pensioner has spent more than a decade painstakingly copying out every single word of the bible - in a 1,500-page labour of love. Religious Dino Mazzoli, 78, came up with the idea of copying the religious text after mobility problems left him housebound back in 2001. The amateur artist then wrote out the whole of the religious text on A4 paper - using hundreds of parker pens and sketching out more than 5,000 colourful illustrations. Mr Mazzoli, who now wants to sell his unique book for charity, got a letter from the pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, after finishing his work - believed to be a world first. Dedicated: Dino Mazzoli shows off part of his hand written and illustrated Bibles. The folders behind him all contain different parts of the religious book . The Italian, who moved to England in 1961, said: 'I have dedicated my whole life to this for years and have done it every single day I could. 'I know it is perhaps considered old-fashioned but I am a Christian and this was something I wanted to do. 'It is unique - people have told me that they have not seen anything like it before.' Mr Mazzoli, from Eastbourne, Sussex, first thought of the idea after struggling to get out the house after giving up work in a book shop. The grandfather-of-three bought an American copy of the Old Testament and a British book of the new testament and began writing it out on A4 paper using a parker pen. Keen artist Mr Mazzoli also began creating illustrations for the text using water colours, crayons and collages. He would then cut them out and stick them into his bible. This colourful illustration of Jesus and one of his followers is one of more than 5,000 that Mr Mazzoli has done while recreating the Bible . Unique: This page of the bible has a number of illustrations accompanying the words. The book is set to be published once copyright issues have been sorted out . Mr Mazzoli said: 'I would start every morning, do 8am until 10 or 11am, again in the afternoon and then for a long time in the evening. 'I started on Genesis and just kept going. I put four to five illustrations on each page of text then a larger drawing every five pages or so. Proud: Mr Mazzoli shows off his work, which he has dedicated himself to for the last ten years . 'I put quite a lot of energy into it.' The influences from Dino’s drawings range from Picasso to Matisse, from Cezanne to del Castagno - with a little bit of each hidden in his pictures. One larger image has a line from Revelation 2:7 alongside a picture of Holocaust victim Anne Frank. Another is inspired by William Blake. Mr Mazzoli has now finished his masterpiece and even won praise from the Pope after his son sent details of the work to Rome. His children, Laura, 38, and Marco, 36, now plan to publish the book both in print form, on the iPad and as an eBook. He is just waiting on the final copyright permission to come through after using text from an American-based translation. Mr Mazzoli said: 'I won’t make a penny from it. I want the proceeds to be divided up between charities, including Save the Children. 'My son sent it to Rome and I got a letter back thanking me for taking the time to do it. I also got a letter from and Archbishop and the Jerusalem Bible makers. 'They said they had never seen anything like it. 'I didn’t realise the Bible was subject to copyright but we are expecting the permission to come through soon so it could be printed later this year. 'I will keep painting. I do pictures for friends and love painting my family.

"Fares are set to rise by 3 per cent above the RPI rate of inflation over the next two years . By . Ray Massey and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 14:15 EST, 13 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:02 EST, 14 July 2012 . Transport Secretary Justine Greening pictured before a cabinet meeting in London set to announce how to fund the £10m rail project . The biggest investment in Britain’s railways since the Victorian era and the age of steam is to be announced by the Government next week in a bid to get the nation’s struggling economy back on track. Up to £10billion is expected to be spent boosting the railways and even reversing some of the infamous ‘Dr Beeching’ cuts imposed by the efficiency expert during the 1960s which saw vast swathes of the rail network and stations dismembered. But fares are set to rise by 3 per cent above the RPI rate of inflation over the next two years. Passengers . paying for their tickets are on course to pay 75 per cent of £5billion a . year total cost of running the railways by 2014 – up from 50 per cent. Transport Secretary Justine Greening is set to announce the funding for a range of schemes including electrification and the opening of new stations designed to improve train services for millions of passengers while pumping much needed cash into a flat-lining economy. One idea set to be resurrected is a ‘Varsity line’ linking the university towns of Oxford and Cambridge. Whitehall sources said:’ It is on track to be the biggest investment in the railways since the Victorian era.’ However, with rail users facing a new round of inflation-busting fares – as taxpayer subsidies in the railways reduce – many passengers will be wondering if they can afford to use the trains. Full details are to be released early next week but the total package is estimated by the rail industry insiders to cost between £9billion and £10billion. Projects are expected to include new rail electrification, including of the Midland Main Line from London to the East Midlands and Sheffield, and local lines in the Welsh Valleys. It means rail journey times between London and the north of England will be cut. It is predicted that the journey time between London and Sheffield could be cut from about two hours and 10 minutes to two hours. Trips between Liverpool and Manchester could also be up to 10 minutes faster. Electrification between Manchester and Leeds is likely to be extended. Projects around Manchester in what is termed ‘The Northern Hub’ are set to get the green light to boost capacity to allow more and faster trains across the North of England. Also envisaged are upgrades to the main East Coast Line from London to Leeds and Newcastle . Investments in rail freight to ports such as Southampton and Felixstowe are likely in a bid to get more lorries off the road. Commuters at the Southeastern High Speed rail service between London and Kent. Rail services all over the country is set to improve yet ticket prices are still on the rise . There will also be some new and reopened lines. Ministers want a new line into Heathrow from the west and are expected to confirm the reopening of the East-West link from Oxford and Aylesbury to Milton Keynes. Funds for local councils to bid for new lines and stations – or re-open old disused ones – are also expected, as well as for redeveloping and upgrading stations, improving accessibility, and  carrying out smaller scale upgrades such as re-instating tracks and platforms removed in the past. There will also be funds to finish projects already underway such as Crossrail and Thameslink in London and electrification of the lines from London to Bristol and Cardiff, and from Manchester to Liverpool, Blackpool and Leeds. The details will be released in a dossier called the High Level Output Specification (HLOS) which is expected to be published on Monday, covering allowed expenditure on the railways for the five years from 2014-19. Rush hour: Fares are set to rise by 3 per cent above the RPI rate of inflation over the next two years with commuters set to cover 75 per cent of £5billion a year total cost of running the railways by 2014 . Ministers will also continue with their support for the controversial High Speed rail link to the Midlands and the North, set to begin from 2026. Some of £10billion extra investment will be borrowed by Network Rail, some will be direct Government funding, and some will be from the letting of rail franchises, as well as from cost saving efficiencies. The Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘Whilst we welcome more investment in rail, massive fares increases shouldn’t be used to pay for it. ‘Rail use is booming, and has continued to grow through the recession, for both passengers and freight. The number of people using trains is now at levels not seen since the 1920s, on a smaller network. ‘Some rural branch lines that were proposed for closure years ago are now seeing record growth and use overcrowded trains. ‘ . A spokesman added: ‘The Government sees infrastructure as a way of boosting the economy and creating growth, and the railways are part of this. Consequently, we expect significant investment. ‘But while we welcome more investment in rail, massive fares increases shouldn’t be used to pay for it. ‘ .","Transport Minister Justine Greening set to announce a £10million scheme to improve rail services .

As ABC's 'Good Morning America' and 'CBS This Morning' carried the minutes silence from the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, viewers of NBC across the country had to rely upon their local affiliate to interrupt 'Today' to witness the poignant ceremonies. While most friends and family of the victims of 9/11 were attending events at Ground Zero, Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania, they expressed their shock afterwards that the network had chosen to be the only national news program not to broadcast the minutes silence. Scroll Down for Video . At the precise moment that CBS and ABC were broadcasting the moment's silence to commemorate 9/11 from Washington D.C and New York City, NBC's 'Today' show was airing an interview with Kris Jenner to the majority of the nation . Dennis McKeon who runs the support group  'Where to Turn' for 1,500 families affected by 9/11 said that for him NBC's decision to air the interview with Kris Jenner at 8.46 a.m. was disappointing but not unexpected. Should NBC apologize for airing Kris Jenner interview instead of 9/11 moment of silence on Today show? 'I was at Ground Zero this morning so I didn't see the interview on television, but it's a disgrace to not show the moments silence ceremony at the time of the attack,' said 55-year-old McKeon whose friend John J. Lennon, a Port Authority policeman died in the Twin Towers collapse in 2001. 'Last year was a big deal with the 10th anniversary and the president came down and this year it wasn't even a 1/4 of the size - which is hurtful to the family members of victims and survivors. 'The newspapers and television stations have relegated it and the fact of the matter is that they are looking for ratings.'

Instead of watching the events from . Washington D.C. where President Obama was in attendance and New York . where families of the victims and representatives of the NYPD, FDNY and . Port Authority Police gathered, the majority of NBC viewers were treated . to Kris Jenner discussing her latest breast operation. 'Shame on them: NBC skips 9/11 moment of silence for Kardashian interview,' wrote B.Loco on Twitter , expressing her outrage.

Would love to . know why @TodayShow thought Kris Jenner was more important: Job . openings soon?' Another wrote, 'The fact that Kris Jenner is a guest on the today show on 9/11 seriously makes me doubt humanity.' Following the moment of silence other networks quickly jumped back into . their routine as CBS went to a commercial break and ABC began an . interview with Richard Gere.

Speaking . with 'Today's' Savannah Guthrie on Tuesday, Jenner, the star of . 'Keeping up with the Kardashians' discussed September 9th's penultimate . episode that showcased her plans to get her 23-year-old  breast implants . replaced. Users of Twitter took to the social networking site to express their disgust over the perceived lack of respect from NBC in broadcasting an interview with Kris Jenner instead of the 9/11 moment of silence at 8.46. a.m. Twitter users expressed their displeasure at the reality television star receiving coverage above the moment of silence for 9/11 on the anniversary of the atrocity . 'I thought it was such a great idea to film that,' Jenner told TODAY's Savannah Guthrie Tuesday morning. 'The reason I went in and did that was because I had had my implants in for 152 years -- you know, a long time, way longer than their shelf life.' And as Jenner discussed her first breast operation since 1989 all the cable channels and CBS and ABC were broadcasting the moment silence and viewers took to Twitter to express their disgust. Some called the network's decision a 'major fail' and a 'new all time low', while another Twitter user simply said 'Shame on them' for their broadcast choice. Megan Kopf, a spokesperson with the Today show, defended the network's coverage of the 9/11 anniversary ceremony. 'The Today show dedicated a considerable amount of time to September . 11th coverage this morning throughout the entire show,' said Kopf to POLITICO. This tops off a summer to forget for NBC, during which the network has taken criticism for their delayed airing of Olympic events such as Usain Bolt's victory in the 100 metres sprint and asked why it did not show more of the London paralympic games. And in the months before the Olympic games, NBC's 'Today' show was rocked by the loss of its formely undisputed morning rating's crown to ABC's 'Good Morning America' and moved Ann Curry off the 'Today' show sofa due to a lack of chemistry with co-host Matt Lauer. During the five minute interview about her cosmetic surgery aired at 8.45. a.m., Jenner, 56, said that all women should be aware of the shelf life of their breast implants. 'You know, take them out and change them after 10 years,' Jenner urged all woman with implants. 'That was a big message and important for me to sort of put out there in a comical way. 'You know, I made fun of myself. Because at my age, you're over 50 -- like, when do you stop? 'But it was so important, health-wise, to remind women to check your expiration date because it's a health risk.' 'I had my implants done in 1989 and that was a long time ago.' 'It is really important to pay attention to what your body is telling you and my body was saying, 'You're tired, it's enough get it fixed.' Twitter users such as Tony Bruno said that NBC should be ashamed of themselves for airing an interview with Kris Jenner instead of the 9/11 moment of silence in Washington D.C. and New York City . This tweet heaps shame on NBC for their broadcast of a Kris Jenner interview about her breast instead of the moment's silence for 9/11 victims . The 'Keeping up with the Kardashians' matriarch spoke of her daughter Kim's relationship with hip-hop-star Kanye West and her own recent breast-op and magazine front cover photoshoot (right) Kris Jenner is put under sedation before she has an operation to replace her breast implants - shown on the penultimate episode of season seven of 'Keeping up with the Kardashians' Discussing her daughter Kim's relationship with Hip Hop star Kanye West, Jenner said that she couldn't be happier for her daughter. 'He's a great guy, I mean he is really a great guy and I think they are well suited for each other and I think they are really really happy and anybody who has kids knows that when your kids are happy, you are happy,' said Jenner. While she and her family prepare for the seventh season finale of their wildly succesful reality television show, the self proclaimed 'momager' has said that she is looking forward to the resolution of her daughter Khloe Kardashina's attempts to become pregnant and start a family.

But after the woman began showing symptoms, including fever, chills and pain in her lymph nodes, she was treated with antibiotics at a Portland hospital. Thanks to this early detection, she survived. 'We got to her just in time,' said Karen Yeargain of the Crook County Health Department. 'If this hadn't happened, we would have had another critically ill person on our hands.' While doctors suspected the woman had the bacterial illness, results from the Centers for Disease Control have now confirmed it, Yeargain said. Deadly: She was bitten by a cat at the same time as Paul Gaylord, pictured, who lost his fingers and toes to the 'black death'. The woman detected the symptoms earlier and has made a full recovery . Terrible symptoms: The disease, pictured ravaging Gaylord's hands in July, killed millions in the Middle Ages and affects about seven people a year in the United States . Plague is spread through the bite of . infected fleas or through direct contact with an infected animal or . person. The disease is now extremely rare, with about seven cases a year . in the U.S. The woman was bitten at the same time as Gaylord, 60, by the stray cat he had adopted. It is thought that the rat was infected by fleas, which carry the disease. After antibiotics failed to make him feel better, he was rushed to hospital when his lymph nodes swelled to the size of lemons. In July, he underwent surgery to remove his withered, blackened fingers and toes - one of the symptoms of the terrible disease that gave it the name, the 'black death'. Survivor: Seven-year-old Sierra Jane Downing from Colorado, pictured with her parents, also contracted the disease earlier this month from a dead squirrel on a camping trip. She has made a full recovery . Research suggests that the bubonic plague, which used to be associated with squalor, is on the increase in affluent communities in the U.S. As more people move to natural environments where ground squirrels and woodrats live, infection increases. The disease is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis that is spread through flea bites. Symptoms usually appear between two and five days after exposure to the bacteria. They include gangrene . of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose; . fever; muscle cramps; seizures; lymph gland swelling. Other potential symptoms include . heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood, aching limbs and extreme . pain, usually caused by the decay of the skin while the person is still . alive. Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days . About 11 cases of plague a year have occured in the U.S. since 1976. 'They tell me I'm doing really good . considering,' he told OregonLive.com from his hospital bed in Bend, . Oregon in July. 'I do feel lucky. I'm going to have a long row to hoe . but at least I have one.' His mother, Almeda, 81, explained how close her son came to death. 'His heart stopped. His lung collapsed. They told us he wasn't going to make it,' she said. Gaylord spent nearly a month on life support and it was so touch-and-go at one point that his son, Jake, flew in from Austin, Texas, to say goodbye. 'I was delirious,' said Mr Gaylor of his memory of the month he spent in intensive care. 'Things didn't seem real. The clock ran backwards.' Although the plague is generally connected to the Middle Ages, the woman is the 18th person sickened by the disease in Oregon since 1934. A seven-year-old girl, Sierra Jane Downing, also contracted the disease while on a camping trip in Colorado this month. It is believed she caught it from a dead squirrel, who she had asked her parents if she could bury. They said no, but she knelt beside it and doctors believe fleas could have jumped on to her sweater. Historic illness: A picture of 1721 shows victims of the plague, which is transferred through the bite of infected fleas or through direct contact with an infected animal or person . Days after they returned from the . trip, her parents found her in the bathroom having a seizure. She was . rushed to hospital and treated with antibiotics once doctors realised . what it was. She will make a full recovery and has been released from hospital. Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days. It causes an infection that kills cells, causing gangrene which also often results in amputation. Symptoms of the plague in humans, which typically appear within four days, include fever, chills and a bloody or watery cough. In animals, it presents itself with enlarged lymph nodes under the jaw, as well as fever and tiredness.","Woman bitten by cat choking on rodent in Oregon in June .

Convicted: Sarah Catt (front), who aborted her own baby within a week of his due date, was sentenced to eight years in prison by a judge at Leeds Crown Court . A MARRIED woman who aborted her baby in the final week of pregnancy following an affair with a work colleague was jailed for eight years yesterday. Sarah Catt, 35, successfully concealed the pregnancy from her husband and took drugs she had bought on the internet to end her pregnancy. She claimed the boy was stillborn and she buried him and cleaned up the bathroom at home without her husband finding out. However, police inquiries later revealed the baby was aborted just two days before her due date – and the following day she went on a family holiday to France as if nothing had happened. The alarm was raised because there was a record of Catt’s pregnancy from an abortion clinic’s scan she had after passing the 24-week legal limit for terminations. She lied to detectives about having a legal abortion at a clinic, but officers have never found the baby’s remains or evidence to show he wasn’t born alive. Catt has refused to say where her son’s remains could be found. She pleaded guilty earlier this year to administering a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Cooke said: ‘The child in the womb here was so near to birth that in my judgement all right-thinking people would consider this offence more serious than manslaughter, or any offence on the calendar other than murder.’ He told Catt she had robbed an apparently healthy child, ‘vulnerable and defenceless, of the life which he was about to commence’. He added: ‘This was a cold, calculated decision that you took for your self-interest alone.’ Leeds Crown Court  heard Catt had an extraordinary history of secret pregnancies and deception. In 1999, when she was a second year university student, she hid her first pregnancy from her parents. She quit her maths course, gave birth to a daughter in hospital and gave her up for adoption immediately. She then began the relationship with Stephen Catt, who she would marry in 2009 after having two children. But in 2000, during the early stages . of their relationship, Catt had an abortion with his agreement at . ‘around the legal limit’ of 24 weeks. She did later give birth to a girl, . but only after seeking to have a termination when she was ‘too far . advanced’. Astonishingly, she also kept a further pregnancy a secret . from Mr Catt until the birth. Despite marrying Mr Catt, a  41-year-old . electrical engineer, she was conducting a long-term affair with a . married colleague at the law firm in York where she worked as an office . manager. Scroll down for video . 'Robbed the baby of life': Sarah Catt, pictured in a police mugshot and earlier today, was condemned by a judge . Prosecutor Simon Waley said police discovered the affair when examining Catt’s computer and took a statement from the lover. The on-off affair had gone on for seven years without Mr Catt finding out, the court heard. In October 2009 Catt told her lover . she was pregnant. He offered to leave his wife to start a family with . her but she ended the relationship and in January told him there was no . child and it was none of his business. The couple resumed their ‘occasional . sexual relationship’ in June 2010 – soon after she had the home abortion . at almost full term. During more than nine hours of . interviews with police Catt insisted she paid £1,700 cash for an . abortion at the Marie Stopes clinic in Manchester three days before the . legal cut-off date. Detectives, however, discovered a . trail of evidence to show she was concealing a crime. It began in March . 2010 when she went to the Leeds branch of the British Pregnancy Advisory . Service with the intention of having an abortion. Sentencing: Catt was jailed for eight years by a judge sitting at Leeds Crown Court . However, it wasn’t carried out because . an ultrasound scan indicated she was 26 weeks pregnant. Catt had a . second scan at St James’ Hospital in Leeds where superior equipment . estimated she was 29 weeks pregnant. Immediately after the scan she did an . internet search, asking: ‘Where can I get an illegal abortion?’ In April . Catt ordered an abortion drug over the internet from a company in . Mumbai, India. The package was delivered on May 10 . and she carried out further  searches about the drug. She took an . afternoon off work on May 25 and is likely to have taken the abortion . drug then. She is believed to have given birth while her husband was out . the next day. Catt told a psychiatrist she ‘acted . alone’ at her home in Sherburn in Elmet, North Yorkshire. She claimed . ‘the child was a boy, was not breathing on birth and did not move’. The Judge told Catt she had shown no . ‘remorse’, commenting that, had she not taken the drug, ‘there is no . reason to believe that you would not have been delivered of a healthy . boy’. Mr Catt did not attend court. He is said to be standing by his wife. The dangers of online abortion pills were highlighted by the Daily Mail last year when it was discovered that British firms were selling the drugs for as little as £15. A Mail investigation found that Women could have the tablets delivered in less than a week, enabling them to terminate their pregnancies illegally and in secret. It is against the law for the pills to be administered without the supervision of a doctor or specially-trained nurse. The investigation found that pills available online were far cheaper than having the treatment privately, which can cost up to £500. Buyers had only to fill in a quick online form giving their date of birth, address, and details of any allergies or medication they were taking. It is legal to have an abortion in the UK during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, but the abortion must be performed in a hospital or specialised licensed clinic. Two doctors must also agree that it would cause less damage to the woman's physical or mental health than continuing with the pregnancy. It can only be performed after 24 weeks if the woman's life is at risk, or there is a substantial risk the child would suffer serious physical or mental handicap.","Sarah Catt, 35, aborted her unborn baby 'in the final stages of pregnancy'

Hundreds of GCSE and A-level grades had to be changed after examiners working in a warehouse added up marks on exam papers wrongly leaving candidates with the wrong grade, an exam board has admitted. Around 250 students are thought to have been affected by the mistakes, with some pupils given results that were wrong by up to two grades. As a result, four examiners were sacked, . and 78 others have been told to improve their performance following the . nine month investigation. Errors: Around 250 students are thought to have been affected by the mistakes with some pupils given results that were wrong by up to two grades . The OCR exam board said it was . 'disappointed' to confirm that a number of grade changes had been made . and said the errors were 'unacceptable.' Mistakes were made by examiners in transcribing and adding up marks in last summer’s exams, after the firm moved its script handling process to a warehouse, OCR said. It is feared some pupils' university applications may have been affected by the wrong A Level grades being issued. In total, 15 A-level grades have been improved, with 28 AS-levels, 37 GCSEs and 34 GCSE short courses. In a further 81 A-level and 56 GCSE cases, changes have been made to units taken last year, and will be taken into account in final qualifications, the awarding body said. In most cases, the changes meant an improvement of one grade. But there were five students who saw their results go up by two grades. Most of the GCSE changes were in Religious Studies, while the majority of A-level changes were in PE. Mistake: 15 A Level grades have been improved with 28 AS Levels and 37 GCSEs while four examiners have been sacked and 78 told to improve performance . An OCR spokeswoman said that if students come forward, their results will be looked at on a case by case basis. The exam board has 13,000 examiners on its books and last year sent out 8.5million exam papers. OCR chief executive Mark Dawe described the errors as 'unacceptable' and said all the schools involved had been informed. He said: 'Following the relocation of script handling to our new warehouse for 2011, I am disappointed to have to confirm a number of grade changes as a result of the discovery of clerical errors made last year. 'I would like to reassure students taking examinations for the first time this year (2012) that I have had our systems significantly improved and this issue cannot and will not affect them. 'Mistakes were made by examiners in the transcribing and totalling of marks. These are unacceptable and OCR apologises to students, schools and parents that our high standards for quality and integrity were not met by some individuals during routine processes. 'I have taken a number of corrective actions to address these matters including terminating four examiners’ contracts, placing another 78 on notice to improve and instituting a new clerical checking regime. 'It is our job to ensure students get the right results that correctly reflect their knowledge and hard work.'","Four examiners have been sacked and 78 told to improve following investigation .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 20:51 EST, 13 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:52 EST, 14 September 2012 . 'Rethinking': Philip Hammond has revealed UK forces could be withdrawn more quickly from Afghanistan . Philip Hammond has revealed plans to bring back more British troops from Afghanistan as early as next year, well ahead of the existing 2014 timetable. The Defence Secretary said there was a 'a bit of rethinking' about soldier numbers after military commanders reported that Afghan forces were taking on the 'lion's share' of the combat role. British forces have shut down 52 of their bases and checkpoints in Helmand over he past six months, leaving just 34 still operating, he said. Downing Street today backed Mr Hammond, saying David Cameron had already made clear that he wants more troops home in 2013. But a No 10 spokesman insisted no final decisions have yet been taken. 'The Prime Minister said in July that he was confident that he would be able to reduce troop numbers further next year, following conversations with commanders on the ground,' the spokesman added. The PM has stressed the need to avoid a 'cliff-edge' on troop withdrawal in 2014, the date when all UK combat troops are due to be out. But he has insisted the decision should be based on progress by the Afghan security forces. Mr Hammond admitted British officers had been privately pushing 'for keeping force levels as high as possible for as long as possible' earlier this year. But military commanders had since been 'surprised by the extent to which they have been able to draw back and leave the Afghans to take the lion's share of the combat role', he added. In an interview with the Guardian in Camp Bastion, Helmand, he said: 'I think there is a bit of a rethinking going on about how many troops we do actually need... 'There may be some scope for a little bit more flexibility on the way we draw down, and that is something commanders on the ground are looking at very actively.' Around 500 British troops are due to return home by the end of this year, leaving a further 9,000 to return by the end of 2014. Mr Hammond added: 'I think that the message I am getting clearly from the military is that it might be possible to draw down further troops in 2013. 'Whereas six months ago the message coming from them was that we really need to hold on to everything we have got for as long as we possibly can. I think they are seeing potentially more flexibility in the situation. 'Talking to senior commanders you get a clear sense that their view of force levels is evolving in light of their experiences.' A British soldier watches as a Chinook lands in Afghanistan: Mr Hammond said we cannot expect our troops to risk their lives to build a better life for Afghans . The Defence Secretary insisted Britain would not be 'spooked' by the run of 'green on blue' attacks - when Afghans turn on international troops. He added: 'We have to be clear why we came here in the first place. I believe very clearly that if we are going to ask British troops to put themselves in the firing line, we can only do that to protect UK vital national security interests. 'We can ask troops who are here to help build a better Afghanistan, but we cannot ask them to expose themselves to risk for those tasks. 'We can only ask them to expose themselves to risk for Britain's national security, which is what they signed up to do.' In order for their to be resolution to the conflict, Britons would have accept that 'Northern Ireland-style' negotiations would have to be made with at least moderate elements within the Afghan insurgency, he said. But he said that the Afghan government's diplomatic efforts with insurgents were lagging behind successes in the military campaign. Mr Hammond also raised concerns about the potential for the unrest that sparked the murder of the U.S. ambassador in Libya to spread to Afghanistan and revealed extra steps had been taken to strengthen security around British bases.","Defence Secretary admits to 'rethink' at how many British forces are still needed .

An inspiring new film tells the unlikely story of four young Aboriginal singers who rose to fame in the face of racial prejudice as Australia's answer to The Supremes. A favourite at Cannes and a box office smash Down Under, The Sapphires follows the talented quartet as they are plucked from obscurity in a remote Aboriginal mission, formed into a dynamic singing group and sent to entertain the troops in Vietnam in 1968. The heartwarming tale is brought to life by writer and former Neighbours star, Tony Briggs, whose mother Laurel Robinson and her sister and cousins - Lois Peeler, Beverley Briggs and Naomi Mayers - were the real Sapphires, four decades ago. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heartwarming: The inspiring film, pictured, tells the unlikely story of four young Aboriginal singers who rose to fame in the face of the racial prejudice . 'I said to the women, ''we have to take a lot of artistic license, but the core of this story for me is about the strength of character of the individuals and the women in my family, my aunties and cousins and who I'd grown up with'',' Briggs told The Australian. Success: The film received a 10 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival . He said his family loved the idea that their experience had inspired a mainstream feature film. 'It is based on a true story and true events,' he said. 'And I've been the one responsible for pulling their stories together.' The movie, one of the highest-grossing in Australian history, received a 10 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was bought up by heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein. It will be released in Britain next month. An adaption of a hugely successful Australian stage musical, the movie stars 23-year-old Australian Idol sensation Jessica Mauboy as lead singer Julie. Irish actor Chris O'Dowd from the IT Crowd and Hollywood comedy Bridesmaids is the group's kind-hearted, soul-loving manager Dave who discovers the girls one night in a dusty outback tavern. Impressed by their honey-sweet voices, Dave convinces the band to switch their act from country and western to soul. While the racist locals strongly oppose the idea of an Aboriginal singing group, Dave vows to make the Sapphires sparkle - all over the world. And he succeeds, with the group's first performance taking them to Vietnam where they sing tunes by Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding for the appreciative soldiers. The true story differs somewhat. Only two of the four women born into the Yorta Yorta community along Victoria's Murray River, ventured to Vietnam - Briggs' mother, Laurel, and her sister, Lois, - while the others refused in protest of the war.

A news director at a Minnesota Fox affiliate resigned Monday after penning a Facebook post about a “drunk, homeless, Native American” who last week wandered into his yard, smiled, and then flashed him the peace sign. Jason Vincent, formerly of KQDS Fox 21 in Duluth, wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday night: . 'Add drunk, homeless, Native American man to the list of animals that have wandered into my yard … Then he proceed (sic) to wave at me and give me the peace sign when he spotted me in the window. Wow …' He said what? Jason Vincent, former news director at a Minnesota Fox affiliate, got into hot water for labeling Native-Americans 'animals' in a Facebook post . A screen grab of the unfortunate update was re-posted on the Fond du Lac People’s Forum, a second Facebook page that invites area residents, and specifically Native-Americans, to voice opinions on one topic or another. Vincent did not return phone calls to area reporters covering the story, but issued an awkward apology in which he confessed, 'I myself am Native,' too. 'I have deleted the post and I certainly understand why it’s being taken out of context and viewed as offensive,' he wrote in his apology.  'I would never insult the Native American community, especially since I myself am Native. 'I did not realize how poor the choice of words were I used until I looked back and saw what I had posted. I sincerely apologize for my words and to anyone offended by them.' “Add drunk, homeless, Native American . man to the list of animals that have wandered into my yard … Then he . proceed (sic) to wave at me and give me the peace sign when he spotted . me in the window. Wow …” Vincent was a reporter and anchor in Fargo before he was hired as Fox 21’s news director in early 2010, according to The Duluth News Tribune. A public furor followed the original post and Vincent's subsequently strained mea culpa. Notably, Duluth’s American Indian Commission and the Human Rights Commission issued a joint statement demanding an on-air apology and that the station’s staff complete an educational workshop on racism. 'As a white man in a position of power, he contributes to our thinking and structures of stereotypes, images, metaphors and emotions,' the joint statement reportedly said. 'This is an opportunity for the community to be further educated on issues of race in Duluth, and we hope that there comes growth from this incident.' Quick Action: Following Vincent's gaffe, Fox 21 in Duluth first required the beleaguered newsman to issue an apology on its own Facebook page, then forced him to resign his post . Brian Flick of St. Paul was one of the first of many to comment on Vincent's by-now-viral status update. 'It made me upset,” said Flick, according to The News Tribune. 'It’s a racist comment.' Meanwhile, Rob Peacock, another commentator, said he was equally offended by Vincent's characterization of Native-Americans as 'animals.' Damage Control: The Fox affiliate aired its statement about 10 minutes into Friday's 6 p.m. broadcast; the station manager apologized for Vincent's gaffe . 'What he (said) didn’t hurt me,' Peacock reportedly noted. 'It did hurt other people. A lot of people, (but) they kind of expect that stuff. And even me personally. I’m a light-skinned native and I’ve heard a lot of comments about natives.' Peacock told The News Tribune that many northern Minnesotans could use cultural sensitivity training and that Vincent’s controversial status update could serve as a flashpoint for a productive conversation about racism. 'It gives us a moment to talk about it,' he said. 'I have deleted the post and I certainly . understand why it’s being taken out of context and viewed as . offensive. I would never insult the Native . American community, especially since I myself am Native.' Vincent had reportedly been news director at Fox 21 since 2010, but began his career as an anchor at KEYC-TV in Mankato, another Minnesota town. Before coming to Fox 21, he was an anchor and reporter for WDAY-TV in Fargo, according to The News Tribune. In announcing Vincent's resignation - it wasn't clear whether he resigned of his own accord or was forced out - Fox 21's general manager, Jackie Bruenjes, wrote, 'Jason has elected to take a new job assignment.' In closing, the terse, three-sentence statement added, 'We wish Jason the best.'","Jason Vincent's status update went public Wednesday and characterized Native-Americans as 'animals'

Featuring more than a few Mod-cons, an original scooter from the film Quadrophenia sits in the psychedelic lounge, while the three bedrooms - boasting decor inspired by the 1969 album - all come fitted with 3D televisions, computers and wi-fi.

When I Get Home: The boat was previously owned by Paramount Pictures and used in their thriller The Hunt for the Red October . Psychedelic: An image from the film . The Beatles always denied the song Yellow Submarine had any hidden meaning or referred to drugs. Paul McCartney who wrote it, said at the time of its release: 'It's a fun song, a children's song. 'Originally . we intended it to be 'Sparky' a children's record. But now it's the . idea of a yellow submarine where all the kids went to have fun. 'I . was just going to sleep one night and thinking if we had a children's . song, it would be nice to be on a yellow submarine where all your . friends are with a band.' However many music fans believe the song is really a reference to the mind-bending hallucinogenic drug LSD. It was written at the height of the Beatles psychedelic period, when they were known to be experimenting with the drug. In the 60s a variety of LSD sold in pill form, was reportedly known as 'yellow submarines'.

A teenage father has been charged with attempted murder after pouring liquor into his two-month-old son's hospital feeding tube. Cesar Ruiz, 19, allegedly pumped Lucas with rum during his stay at Ochsner Hospital in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, which he was admitted to with breathing difficulties on October 16. The child was undergoing treatment ahead of surgery scheduled for Wednesday when on Sunday he began having seizures. He was moved to the pediatric intensive care unit where doctors found him to have a blood alcohol level of .289, more than twice the 0.8 per cent legal limit for driving in Louisiana. Ruiz confessed to the crime, explaining that he acted to relieve his son's suffering and did not intend to kill him, police said. He told officers he had taken a feeding tube from the hospital when he left to go home and shower and filled it up with rum before returning. The baby's mother, Erika Wigstrom, said she had noticed a bottle of Bacardi Silver Rum in the freezer on Saturday night, that had not been there a few hours later.

Fighter Azran Quasid, 26, attacked the women on different occasions after befriending them, Guildford Crown Court was told. The second rape is said to have been carried out while Quasid was on bail after being accused of the first. Toyin Salako, prosecuting, said: 'Both women are strangers to each other. Neither of them had ever met the other. 'On each occasion, he refused to take ‘no’ for an answer.' The jury was told that both crimes were committed in the defendant’s home in Camberley, Surrey. The . first alleged attack was on an 18-year-old girl in June last year, . while the second was in April of this year, the jury heard. Ms Salako said the first woman fell victim to Quasid after they met on Facebook. The complainant told police she had gone to the defendant’s house but had made it plain that she was not prepared to have sex. The victim told police this did not stop Quasid from 'trying it on' while the pair were in his bedroom watching DVDs. The woman, whose police interview, was played to jurors, said she told Quasid: 'Slow down. I don’t know you.' She added she had even devised a strategy before arriving to Quasid's house in the even he attempted to have sex with her.

The victim said she was eventually overpowered by Quasid, who is nearly six feet tall. Fighting friends: The court was told the defendant was a cage fighter and knew Katie Price's ex husband, Alex Reid . Namesake: Quasid's ring-name is 'Casanova' after Giacomo Casanova, the 18th-century Italian adventurer and notorious womaniser . She said: 'He was so much stronger than me,' before adding that Quasid had penetrated her anally with his fingers and forced her to have intercourse with him. The complainant said she was afraid to resist too strongly. 'I didn’t want to make him angry,' she said. The woman then left the house before telling a friend what had happened. Ten months later, the defendant befriended another woman, the jury heard. Ms Salako said Quasid pestered the second woman for sex despite her telling him 'no'. 'He wasn’t going to take no for an answer,' Ms Salako added. The court heard that Quasid then raped the complainant anally.

In the past 18 months over 40 poles have been bent, buckled or broken in one area of south Auckland, it is claimed.

Arrested: Beverly Greenagel, 64, was watching six more children than allowed the day that three-month-old Dane Ableidinger died in her care . A 64-year-old day-care provider was charged this week in the death of an infant boy who suffocated in his sleep last August. Police arrested Beverly Ann Greenagel yesterday, charging her with two counts of second-degree manslaughter, child neglect and endangerment, and interfering with a body after three-month-old Dane Abledinger was found lifeless after being put down for a nap. Greenagel, who at the time was watching six more children than legally allowed, allegedly did not check on the boy for an hour after putting him face-down for a nap. She was holding an annual water balloon fight with her older children and later told police she  moved him downstairs so he wouldn't get trampled. Dane had apparently suffocated and was found where she left him on the flannel blanket. Each of the two counts of second-degree manslaughter come with a maximum sentence of 10 years each, as well as a $20,000 fine. According to the Minnesota Star-Tribune, Greenagel worked out of her home and ran Bev’s Day Care. She was licenced to look after a total of 12 children without a second caregiver. At the time of Dale’s death on August 18, 2011, police in Egan, Minnesota said there were 20 children at her facility, including two toddlers, three infants, and eight preschoolers. They further alleged that Greenagel violated several safe-sleep standards required by the state. The paper reported that Greenagel laid Dane down to sleep on his stomach in one of the bedrooms in her house, perhaps because a child who had just awoken from a nap had soiled its crib. Short life: Dane Ableidinge was only three-and-a-half months old when he died; his autopsy revealed that he suffocated to death . Work from home: Greenagel ran her service, Bev's Day Care, from her home in Eagan, Minnesota . Minnesota law states that a single caregiver can only have a maximum of three infants and toddlers, with a total of 12 children. A frantic 12-year-old girl who called 911 after Dane was discovered was recorded as saying: ‘Oh, um. There’s a baby dead.’ Records from the state show that Greenagel allegedly tried to cover her tracks by taking the blanket Dane had slept on and stacking it with other blankets. Dane had left blood spots on it. When police searched the house after obtaining a warrant, they found the blood stains and confirmed that they belonged to the infant. Dane’s cause of death was probable positional asphyxia, meaning that he most likely suffocated from the position in which he was placed. According to the Inver Grove Heights Patch, Greenagel gave several varying accounts of the story to authorities. Greenagel had cared for the girl and was enlisting her help to care for the child. The Star-Tribune notes that caretakers must be at least 13. Dakota County Attorney told the Star-Tribune: ‘It’s always disturbing to see children die under any circumstance, and it appears that proper monitoring and care could have avoided this tragedy.’ In Minnesota, 82 children have died in licenced day-care facilities in the past ten years. Loving parents: Mac and Stephanie Ableidinger asked for donations in lieu of flowers in memory of their young son . Court documents show the caretaker was cited once in 1984 and again in 1994 for violating the terms of her licence. On April 6, 1984, Greenagel was found to have too many infants and toddlers in her care. Three months later, a parent complained that the caregiver was often absent, and instead hired a 16-year-old girl to look after the children. The parent alleged that Greenagel would often leave to go shopping, play racquetball, and go shopping while the girl was left to care for the infants and toddlers. The parent added that ‘Bev’s’ home was a good place for their children, but they were upset she was not around. A decade later, an unannounced licensor visit proved that she still had more children in her care than her license allowed. Dane’s parents, Stephanie and Mac Abledinger, did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment on Greenagel’s charges. Mrs Abledinger works as a hairstylist, and her husband is a postal worker. Greenagel, meanwhile, remains in jail on a $75,000 bond and will have a hearing later this month.","Beverly Ann Greenagel arrested and charged with second-degree manslaughter for August 2011 death of infant Dane Abledinger .

Prison romp: Nurse Jane Jackson was caught in a tryst with a dangerous prisoner in her treatment room . A prison nurse was found semi-naked in her treatment room with a dangerous inmate, a misconduct hearing was told yesterday. Jane Jackson wedged the door closed with a mop during the liaison at a high-security jail dubbed ‘Britain’s Alcatraz’. When a colleague burst in, the 35-year-old was hiding behind the door stripped to the waist clutching her bra and top, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told. Jackson is accused of having ‘sexually motivated’ meetings with the man, referred to as prisoner A, in January and February 2009. At the time, she was employed by Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust as a staff nurse based at HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire. She is also said to have smuggled in toiletries for her lover, and to have left her prison keys unattended and a medication cupboard open in his presence. Barry Dooley, for the NMC, said: ‘She said she regretted her actions and was in a vulnerable state of mind at the time. She knew prisoner A had strong feelings for her, and deep down knew he was a prisoner, she was an officer, and what she was doing was wrong. ‘It is a category A prison for the highest level of offences, including rape, murder and terrorism,’ said Mr Dooley. ‘These are highly dangerous offenders.’ On February 7, 2009, Jackson was reported to her colleague Rebecca Langley for being in the treatment room alone with prisoner A, in breach of strict regulations. ‘The door was closed, and Miss Langley tried to open the door but could not,’ said Mr Dooley. ‘She felt the door was locked by an item on the inside. She continued to call out and after ten to 15 seconds the door opened from the inside.’ Miss Langley saw prisoner A sat on the treatment bed in shorts and a T-shirt, Mr Dooley said, and Jackson was cowering behind the door. ‘Her top half was naked, and she was holding her bra and tunic in her hand’, he said, adding: ‘Miss Langley asked how she had locked the door, and the [nurse] replied that this is how we always do it, by wedging the mop against the door.’ High security: The incident occurred at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, which has been dubbed 'Britain's Alcatraz' Jackson was accused of putting the security of the prison at risk by allegedly unclipping her belt – which held her prison keys – while locked in the treatment room. She was immediately sent to a manager to explain herself and was suspended that day. Following an investigation, she was sacked by the health trust on July 9, 2009. Yesterday’s fitness-to-practise hearing, in London, was told Jackson has admitted being caught half-dressed with prisoner A, but will argue she was not completely topless. She has also confessed to bringing unauthorised toiletries into the prison, embracing prisoner A, and unclipping her prison keys during the treatment room liaison. However, she denies further trysts with prisoner A, and rejects allegations her conduct was sexually motivated or that she left the medication cupboard unlocked. She also denies her fitness to continue as a nurse has been impaired.

Jailed: Burglar Paramkesh Ballgobin switched on a PlayStation and played a football game for four hours after he fell into a youth centre through a ceiling . Most crooks would immediately begin looking for a way to escape if they found themselves trapped in a building they were trying to burgle. But Paramkesh Ballgobin was in no hurry to leave after he fell 12ft through a ceiling into a youth training centre - he switched on a PlayStation and played a football game for four hours. CCTV footage shows how the jobless criminal took time to pace about the centre and even removed some of his clothes before he lay back to relax in front of the games console. Ballgobin became trapped after he fell through a suspended ceiling at the Road 2 Success training centre in Sutton, South London, at 2.30am on September 6. The 20-year-old serial shoplifter, who has an Asbo banning him from Sutton town centre, made himself a cup of tea and tried to get the television to work. But he became angry when he couldn't operate the remote control and so carried on playing football game FIFA on the PlayStation instead. At one point, CCTV cameras caught him ripping a poster off the wall which said: 'Some people are gay, get over it'. It was only at about 6.30am - some four hours after he fell - that Ballgobin realised he would need to concentrate on getting out before youth workers arrived. He eventually found a ladder in the centre - formerly called Sutton and District Training Centre - and clambered back out of the hole he had fallen through. Ballgobin was arrested six days later after youth workers and police recognised him.

A Merseyside schoolboy died after being swept from rocks into the sea while on a family holiday in Wales despite a valiant attempt by his older brother to save his life. Fifteen-year-old Sam Capper was on holiday when he was washed away when a freak wave crashed against the slippery rocks where he was fishing. The sporty teenager, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, drowned despite the valiant attempts of his older brother Lewis Hunt, 21, who battled dangerous rip currents to try and keep his sibling afloat. Close family: Sam Capper, pictured here with his brother Lewis Hunt, who tried to save him, and mother Leah Hunt . At one point the University student managed to grab his brother's hands but they were ripped apart by the outgoing tide and strong offshore winds. Lewis was in a serious condition yesterday at Morriston Hospital in Swansea with his father Phil, 42, and mother Leah, 41, keeping a vigil at his bedside. Leah said: 'Our only consolation in . this terrible tragedy is that, at the end, Sam wasn’t on his own - Lewis . was with him, holding on to him tightly. 'Sam, . who most people knew as Spud, was a unique, amazing, boy who touched . the lives of so many people with his generosity, kindness and infectious . laugh. Sam had been camping with his father Phil on  family holiday when tragedy struck and he was swept away . 'He loved . his brothers and sisters and spent most of his time - when he wasn’t . thinking about football - trying to help people and make people smile. 'He . was a huge fan of Tranmere Rovers, though he also liked Arsenal - which . caused a bit of good-natured rivalry with Lewis who supports Liverpool. 'Sam has left a gap in our lives and will be missed, not just by his family, but by everyone who knew him.' Phil was taking his sons for their yearly camping trip at Llangennith on the Gower coast near Swansea. The family had travelled from their home in Birkenhead, Merseyside, to visit the seaside campsite when the tragedy struck. Sam's brother Lewis, who is now in hospital, tried to save the sporty teen, but lost him to the strong current . At around 8pm the pair, who are understood to have been camping nearby with their parents, were on . slippery rocks in an area known as Bluepool Corner, when suddenly a . 'huge wave' took the 15-year-old with it into the sea. Lewis dived in to find him and . managed to hold his hand as they were tossed around by the water, but a . strong tide and winds separated them and took them around half a mile . out to sea. Geraint Parry, principal of Sam's school the University Academy in Birkenhead, paid tribute. He said: 'Sam was an outgoing and popular young man who enjoyed life to the full. 'His gentle humour and easy banter won him many friends and his teachers described him as a 'model student'. Sam was affectionately known as 'Spud', a model student and a keen sports player . 'He was also an able sportsman, loved . playing football and hockey, and having just completed Year 10 he was . due to begin his final year where he looked set to achieve success. 'Sam's death has shocked our close . community and we will be doing all that we can to support his friends . and family, and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this sad . time.' Steve Jones was leading the rescue from the shore for the coastguard and told MailOnline what happened. 'They were fishing on the water's edge when the youngest boy . was swept into the sea by a huge wave,' he said . 'His brother then jumped in himself to save him. 'The tide was going out and there was also an offshore wind . that dragged them out to sea and they ended up around half a mile out. 'I know they were together for a while. The brothers were . holding hands hands at one point in the water but couldn't keep together and . were separated. 'Sadly the youngest boy died. His brother swallowed water . and had hyperthermia but he will be okay, although he will be very distressed.' Stunned friends last night began to pay tribute to the popular teenager on Facebook and Twitter. One of Sam’s closest friends, David Moore, said: 'Sam Capper was one of my true mates.

Tragedy: The 15-year-old was swept into the sea here at Bluepool Corner on the Gower at around 8pm last night . 'He was so funny and amazing. 'You will be missed, sleep tight.' Family friend Billy Newman wrote: 'RIP, Sam Capper. 'You will be missed very much. My heart goes out to you and your family. 'RIP little man.' And Wirral teenager Elisha Price added: 'RIP, Sam, I hope your brother pulls through in hospital. 'Keep looking down on him giving him the strength to pull through.' Two other boys were with the brothers when the tragic accident happened. 'The two . others there thought about doing the same thing as his brother but did the right thing and ran . for help,' Mr Jones said. 'Unfortunately because they were in the middle of nowhere it . took 10 minutes for them to find a young couple with a mobile phone who then . rang 999. 'Within 34 minutes we had them both out of the water. 'We are all very sad that this poor boy has died but at . least one life was saved.' Bluepool Corner is a secluded beauty . spot that can only be reached by foot. The actual cause of death has not . yet been confirmed, police said. 'We . responded to reports of two males in the sea at Llangennith, Swansea, . at around 8.20pm on Wednesday August 1,' a South Wales Police spokesman . said. Rescue: The boy was plucked from the water by a RAF helicopter like this one but sadly died later . 'They were taken by helicopter to Morriston hospital where one of the males, aged 15, was pronounced dead. 'The other male, aged 21, remains in hospital.' Swansea Coastguard said it had called out the Rhossili Coastguard rescue team, the Loughor independent rescue boat, Burry Port RNLI inshore lifeboat and the Tenby RNLI all-weather lifeboat and a rescue helicopter. One brother was picked up by Burry Port lifeboat and the other was winched from the water by the helicopter.

The farce over WikiLeaks fugitive Julian Assange may already have left taxpayers with a bill of £1million, it emerged last night. The staggering total is made up of legal, policing and court costs run up over two years as he fought extradition to Sweden over rape allegations. The 41-year-old Australian was granted asylum by Ecuador on Thursday and is holed up in the country’s embassy in Knightsbridge, central London. Scroll down for video . We're going in guv'nor: Police officers enter the Ecuadorian embassy in Knighstbridge this morning, with Mr Assange holed up inside . And back out again: The bobbies return empty handed as the prospect looms of an expensive stand-off lasting months - or even years . He took his case all the way to the Supreme Court in an effort to dodge justice, but it ruled he could be extradited. 'Tense and restive': Julian Assange has just a treadmill for exercise, a sunlamp and internet connection inside the Ecuadorian embassy . He entered the embassy while out on . bail and the total cost of his case is expected to hit millions after it . was announced he will now take it to the International Court of Justice . in the Hague. Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, said Britain was obliged under international law to allow his client safe passage to Ecuador. He said: ‘We will go before the . International Court of Justice to demand that Britain complies with its . obligations because there is a person who runs the risk of being . persecuted politically.’ A victory for Assange would put . ministers in the difficult position of facing the humiliation of letting . him leave or defying the court. In the meantime, Assange appeared set . on rubbing the Government’s nose in its continued failure to arrest him. Police have been ordered to beef up their presence outside the . Ecuadorian embassy tomorrow ahead of what diplomats described as a . ‘media stunt’. A source said: ‘We’re expecting [his lawyer] to appear with a TV screen so Assange can launch some sort of bizarre statement.’ Yesterday the extensive security . operation remained in place. Some 50 police officers are involved at any . one time and it is thought to be costing around £50,000 a day. Security . sources said Assange would be arrested and deported if he put ‘one toe’ outside the embassy. Police positioned inside the building . housing it – shared with the Colombian embassy – will seize Assange if . he crosses the threshold and gives up diplomatic protection. One Whitehall source said: ‘If he should leave the territory of the embassy he will be arrested.’ Police also have access to the common parts of the building which are not Ecuadorian territory. Guard: A policeman looks at a balcony, that could be used by Mr Assange when he addresses crowds on Sunday . Television cameras stand behind a barrier plastered with posters supporting the internet whistle blower whose activities infuriated the U.S. Another security official said: ‘If he puts one toe into the corridor police are under orders to take him.’ Diplomats who had to take back their . threat to ‘storm’ the embassy and withdraw its diplomatic status are . seeking support from allies at the UN, urging them to pressure the . Ecuadorians. Ecuador has also launched its own . diplomatic campaign, calling a meeting of the Organisation of American . States for emergency talks. Discussions between the country’s . female ambassador, Ana Alban Mora, and Foreign Office officials earlier . this week were described as ‘cordial and constructive’, however. Fiasco: A taxi driver falls for a hoax call from a prankster yesterday who ordered a cab to the airport for the Wikileaks rebel. Takeaway pizzas, and a number more cabs were also ordered . A diplomatic bag similar to the type that could be used to smuggle Mr Assange into south America. His would, of course, have Ecuadorian markings and not U.S. The saga began in late 2010 when . Sweden issued a demand for Assange to face questioning over allegations . of rape and sexual assault made by two WikiLeaks supporters, which he . denies. Since then he has spent more than a . full working week in court fighting against extradition there. Every . minute of a high-profile court case costs £100 in general courtroom . costs. In addition, the Crown Prosecution Service has been working on . behalf of the Swedish authorities and absorbing the cost as part of a . mutual aid agreement.

Lawyers for Assange’s alleged victims said their voices had been lost amid the furore. Claes Borgstrom, lawyer for the two . women, said: ‘Julian Assange himself is very clever to move focus from . what he has actually suspected of having done to something that is . completely different.’ Company: Ecuadorian Ambassador Ana Alban smiles from inside the embassy in London where Mr Assange is currently being housed .

Kensington strangler: Serial killer Antonio Rodriguez will serve three consecutive life sentences for the murders of three women in Philadelphia, U.S. in 2010 . A man dubbed the 'Kensington strangler' will serve three life sentences after being convicted of raping and killing three women. Antonio Rodriguez, 23, who has a history of mental illness, strangled three prostitutes during sex in what a judge described as 'a horrific case'. The spate of grisly murders gripped Kensington, Philadelphia, U.S. in late 2010. 'This is just a horrific case,' Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey Minehart said after finding Rodriguez guilty of three counts of first degree murder. 'You not only violated these young women while they were living, but you violated them when they were dead.' Rodriguez killed Elaine Goldberg, 21, Casey Mahoney, 27 and Nicole Piacentini, 35, during November and December 2010. The killer said in statements following his arrest in January 2011 that he had met his victims, who were working as prostitutes, while walking the streets of Kensington. He had sex with them in secluded areas where the murders took place. Leo Michael Keller, the stepfather of Nicole Piacentini - a mother of four - was quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer as saying: 'When these things occur, it just questions humanity. Why do people do these types of things? 'It's a terrible thing.' Joseph Goldberg, the father of 21-year-old victim Elaine Goldberg, said: 'It's just like a huge part of me has died. It's not fun to wake up anymore...it's a task to get through the day.' Casey Mahoney's aunt Mary Kanzenberg said: 'It is our hope that the defendant will spend the rest of his life tortured by the isolation he will be in.' Elaine Goldberg, 21 . Nicole Piacentini, 35 . Casey Mahoney, 27 . Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega said Rodriguez's actions were the embodiment of evil. 'He killed these young ladies not out of anger, but because of evilness, wickedness. 'With great pleasure, he killed them.' Defence attorney William Bowe had questioned the reliability of DNA evidence and a discrepancy over when Rodriguez was taken into custody to ask that he be acquitted of all charges. 'Embodiment of evil': Convicted killer Antonio Rodriguez stalked the streets of Kensington, Philadelphia, pictured above, to find his victims .
