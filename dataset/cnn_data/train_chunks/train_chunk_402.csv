"Daisy, my sister's miniature schnauzer, made quite an impression on me during an extended visit. I even found a schnauzer rescue group and submitted an online application, hoping for a feisty fur kid of my own. No one ever called. I remember being disappointed at the time, but regular outings with Daisy helped ease my bruised ego. Eventually, I crossed paths with a precocious pooch named Lulu who changed everything. Our escapades inspired my quest to help other frazzled, first-time pet owners. I also took solace in a hilarious book called ""What the Dog Did: Tales from a Formerly Reluctant Dog Owner,"" by Emily Yoffe. Stories about Sasha the beagle helped me realize that I wasn't alone in lamenting my Lulu's penchant for chewing shoes, rolls of toilet paper or brand-new dog beds. In Yoffe's recent Slate.com article, she writes about being rebuffed by a rescue organization, after suffering through a litany of probing questions. Eventually, her family gave up and purchased their next pet from a breeder. Yoffe's column reminded me of that fruitless schnauzer application all those years ago. Perhaps my own answers took me out of the running. ""People who rescue animals can be reluctant to believe anyone deserves the furry creatures,"" Yoffe says in the article. ""Applicants are sometimes subjected to an interrogation that would befit Michael Vick."" MNN: Cuddling dying pets can expose owners to infections . Why all the drama? Rescue organizations relieve overcrowded animal shelters by placing animals in foster homes and actively promoting them on sites like Petfinder.org. As rescued pets adjust to family life, volunteers gather information that will help them find a love match. If things don't work out, most rescue groups allow you to return the pet -- no questions asked -- which makes the vetting process even more important on the front end. But questions such as ""Do you plan to have children?"" or ""How much would you spend on a sick animal?"" can rub some well-intentioned pet lovers the wrong way. Representatives from three rescue groups offer a little insight on some of those probing pet questions. How much are you willing you spend on a pet? ""That's just our way of making sure they have no problem taking the dog to the vet if it's hurt or sick,"" says Janice Brooks, director of Rescued Unwanted Furry Friends Rescue (911ruff.org). Based in Fort Walton Beach, Florida., Brooks' nonprofit organization has struggled to place dogs after the Gulf oil spill. Rather than take in more pets from animal shelters, Brooks and her team have focused on finding homes for the remaining 34 pets in her care. Recent owner surrenders, due to military deployment or a battered Gulf Coast economy, make the adoption process even tougher. But her goal is to avoid making a bad match. ""They've been through enough already."" The issue of pet expenses also becomes a factor when people select high-maintenance breeds. Bulldogs are notoriously allergic to grains. These short-snouted dogs also tend to have breathing issues, placing them at the top of the ""do not fly"" list for most airlines. But the popular breed generates plenty of adoption applications for Georgia English Bulldog Rescue or GEBR. ""I turn away a lot of people who have unrealistic expectations,"" says Ruthann Phillips, director of GEBR. She notes that a typical vet visit for one of her bulldogs can top $200. Annual veterinary bills for poorly bred English bulldogs can easily cost 10 times that amount. MNN: Pet resources for a tough economy . In 2011, dog owners spent $248 on routine vet care and cat owners spent $219, according to a survey by the American Pet Products Association. Like people, pets also get sick from time to time, adding to that bill. Rescue groups look for applicants who will commit to routine vaccinations, along with preventatives to fight fleas and the threat of heartworm, a life-threatening illness transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Do you have a veterinarian? ""We contact [the vet] to make sure they bought heartworm preventatives, flea preventatives, that they kept the pet up to date on shots,"" Brooks says, noting that vets provide clues to a pet's care. ""When I called, [one applicant] hadn't taken dogs to the vet in years. I would hate to know [a dog] was hurt and they did not take them to the vet."" Her rescue will accept first-time pet owners, even without a veterinary referral. In those cases, Brooks provides a pet primer, filled with information about flea and heartworm preventatives, foods to avoid such as chocolate, and other key information. Do you plan on having children? Kids and pets can peacefully coexist, but some little ones have trouble resisting the temptation to pull ears or tails. My nephew's first steps were quickly followed by mad dashes around the house in hot pursuit of Daisy. My sister quickly had to introduce the word, ""gentle,"" during playtime when he tried to tap rather than pet the poor pooch. Most rescue groups also have stories of owners who surrendered pets because they couldn't handle the work involved with raising kids and pets. ""We would get owner surrenders from young people who got bulldogs as their first child -- then they had children -- and were unable to afford both,"" Phillips says. Brooks adds that the question helps them determine a good fit for the pet. ""We know which dogs do and do not like children,"" she says. ""I don't want a child to get hurt."" Do you own a home or rent? ""We received a form last week, an owner surrender, because the person didn't check with their landlord first,"" says Dianne DaLee, vice president of Atlanta Boxer Rescue (ABR). ""The landlord said you are not allowed to have dogs over 45 pounds, and the dog had to go."" ABR requires prospective clients to secure a letter from their landlord as part of the adoption process. Brooks also recommends that all family members visit prospective pets, and agree to the adoption. If living conditions change, it helps to have other members of the household who will take responsibility for the pet. MNN: 10 things you might not know about cats . Do you have a fenced backyard? ""When people go to work, let's say they have an 8 to 5 job, they have to leave early to get to the job, then they are late coming home. That's nine to 10 hours before the dog can go out,"" Brooks says. ""If you have a way for dog to go out, potty and come back in, there's generally no problem with the new home. The people are happy; the dogs are happy."" While DaLee admits that questions on adoption applications can resemble the Spanish Inquisition, honest answers help volunteers find the best fit. Some rescued dogs have never seen the inside of a house. Others require extensive training or veterinary care before they are ready to be adopted. Myles, a 7-month-old new addition to ABR, arrived with such severe mange that it had caused secondary skin infections on about 40% of his body. After receiving medical attention and a little love from his foster family, he is slowly beginning to heal and even play. ""These dogs come from rough backgrounds,"" DaLee says. ""We want them to have a permanent home, and not be turned back in to a rescue or hop from home to home.""","In 2011, dog owners spent $248 on routine vet care and cat owners spent $219 .

"Diana Nyad is making good progress in her latest attempt to swim to Florida from Cuba, her crew said Sunday. ""There's no stopping her now,"" the crew said on her blog. After jumping into the waters off Havana on Saturday afternoon -- a day earlier than originally planned -- Nyad had swum nearly 28 statute miles as of Sunday evening, putting in 50 strokes a minute, her blog reported. The full distance to Key West, Florida, is 103 miles, a trip expected to take Nyad 60 hours if the 62-year-old is successful in her attempt -- her fourth. ""I feel I have a lot more energy but I'm conserving,"" she said, according to a message posted on her official Twitter feed. Nyad was reported to be ""comfortable"" and ""confident"" after a difficult first night in the water. Nyad back in water for Cuba-Florida swim attempt . She was stung by jellyfish on her lips, forehead, hands, and neck.  Some stings were from box jellyfish, her blog said. ""Cheered by her crew as she swam toward the side of her escort boat, Voyager, for a feed this morning, she gave the thumbs up"" and asked how the crew was doing, according to her blog.  ""Today is more like swimming,"" Nyad said in a quote on the blog.  ""I don't know what you would call last night -- probably surviving."" An ""unfriendly"" one-foot chop of waves made her swim tougher overnight, the blog said, but at ""present the current is no longer against her."" Girl, 14, crosses Lake Ontario . She began the swim a day early because the water seemed to be ""fantastic,"" Nyad said at a news conference before beginning the swim.  Her Xtreme Dream team ""Has been brainstorming and thinking, 'We've got to get out there,'"" she said. Nyad's first attempt to cross the Straits of Florida was in 1978, when rocky seas left her battered, delirious and less than halfway toward her goal. She returned to the effort twice last year.  She was done in once by an 11-hour asthma attack and was later thwarted by box jellyfish stings. Nyad insisted she was ready to try it again now, and acknowledged Friday, ""I'm feeling tremendous inner pressure that this has got to be it, this has got to be the last time."" Diana Nyad making fourth attempt at Cuba-to-Florida swim . She's in the water without a shark cage, relying on electronic shark repellent and a team of divers to keep them away. In the 1970s, Nyad won multiple swimming marathons and was one of the first women to encircle the island of Manhattan.  She holds the world's record for longest ocean swim -- 102.5 miles from the island of Bimini in the Bahamas to Jupiter, Florida. Nyad says she was 8 years old when she first dreamed about the possibility of swimming across the Straits of Florida.  At the time, she was in Cuba on a trip from her home in Florida in the 1950s, before Fidel Castro led a Communist takeover in Cuba and its relations with the United States soured. ""I used to stand on the beach and I said to my mother, 'I wonder if anybody could swim over there,"" Nyad recalled saying, while pointing to the Keys. In her 60s, she says, she still feels ""vital (and) powerful"" -- and definitely ""not old."" A successful swim ideally will inspire people her age and older not to let their age hinder them, Nyad said. ""When I walk up on that shore in Florida, I want millions of those AARP sisters and brothers to look at me and say, 'I'm going to go write that novel I thought it was too late to do. I'm going to go work in Africa on that farm that those people need help at. I'm going to adopt a child. It's not too late, I can still live my dreams,'"" she said.

"A former boxer was arrested Wednesday in the 1987 murder of his manager after investigators developed a break in the case by using DNA evidence, Los Angeles police said. A fugitive task force from the FBI joined by local police arrested Exum Speight, 50, in Los Angeles suburb of San Fernando, authorities said. He has been charged in a warrant with one count of murder in the March 29, 1987, death of boxing manager Douglas Stumler, Los Angeles police said. In 1996, Speight fought Wladimir Klitschko, the current heavyweight champion of the world, police said. Speight's attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. Los Angeles' cold case detectives developed a break in the case after they screened potential forensic leads under a grant from National Institute of Justice's ""Solving Cold Cases with DNA"" program, authorities said. ""DNA evidence did play a key factor in this case getting solved,"" the police said in a statement. Stumler was killed in his apartment in the west Los Angeles area and was discovered by a friend who checked on him after Stumler failed to report to his full-time job at the Los Angeles County Housing Authority, police said. Stumler held a side job as a boxing manager and was managing Speight as one of his boxers for about two years, police said. Stumler, a native of New Albany, Indiana, moved to Los Angeles after graduating from the University of Indiana about six years before his death, police said. Speight is scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday. Possible lead unearthed in Oakland County child killer case .

"A massive northern California wildfire that's threatening Yosemite National Park and San Francisco's key water and power sources grew Monday, becoming the 13th largest in state history, state fire authorities said. The Rim Fire, which has devoured 160,980 acres, has scorched an area about the size of the city of Chicago while more than 3,600 firefighters try to rein it in. Susan Loesch and Curtis Evans just started settling into their second home in California's Sierra foothills a few months ago. Now, they're worried it could go up in smoke as the massive wildfire spreads. ""This is kind of a little paradise up here for us. ... To think this would all be gone would be devastating,"" Evans told CNN on Sunday. Cradling their Chihuahua, Cuervo, they prepared to leave the area Sunday. ""It's scary,"" Loesch said. ""You worry about the firefighters being on the line. ... It's overwhelming."" The wildfire, which was 20% contained Monday night, was spreading primarily to the east and threatened to grow amid extremely dry conditions and hot weather. Part of the fire continued to spread Monday toward a key part of San Francisco's water supply: the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, which lies within Yosemite and is just east of the flames. The fire also could threaten the area's hydroelectric generators, which provide much of San Francisco's electricity. Because of the approaching flames, officials shut down the generators, and the city -- more than 120 miles to the west -- temporarily is getting power from elsewhere. ""There's a lot of concern, and there's a lot of work to be done,"" U.S. Forest Service spokesman Lee Bentley said. Northwest of the reservoir, rocky terrain could stop the fire's growth there, Bentley said. As many as 20 helicopters and air tankers were aiding firefighting efforts. A top priority is stopping the fire from spreading further in Yosemite National Park. Yosemite fire: Blaze spreads to national park . ""The park is a national treasure,"" said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Vickie Wright, ""so no matter what it takes, we're going to do everything in our power to protect that park."" While the Rim Fire has consumed at least 12,000 acres in the northwest section of the park, so far it has had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the famous cliffs and waterfalls in the park. About 4,500 structures, many of them vacation homes, were under threat, according to InciWeb, a federal website that collects information from agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. The fire so far has cost more than $20 million, Bentley said. Wildfire threatens 90-year-old cabin . The inferno threatened the Yosemite gateway communities of Groveland and Pine Mountain Lake just outside the Stanislaus National Forest. ""Business is slow, very slow,"" said Corinna Loh, owner of the Iron Door Saloon in Groveland. Her normal season is Memorial Day to Labor Day. ""This is time we manage to save up money to make it through the winter, so it's really scary for all of us,"" she said, sitting among empty tables. The Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office, meanwhile, issued evacuation advisories for the town of Tuolumne and nearby Ponderosa Hill, InciWeb said. It was not clear how many residents were covered by the evacuation advisory. The fire has destroyed 11 homes and 12 outbuildings, as well as a Yosemite campground owned by the city of Berkeley, officials said. Authorities say the Rim Fire started on August 17. The cause is under investigation. Fire, what fire? The park typically has 15,000 visitors on a busy summer weekend. August sees an influx of visitors from other countries, a few of whom have called to check on conditions. Still, there's little indication so far it's keeping many people away. Ranger programs went on as normal over the weekend and campgrounds were full. ""If somebody cancels, there are 10 people that will take their spot,"" said Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman. Yosemite, with hundreds of campground sites and lodging units, had nearly 4 million visitors last year, the National Park Service said.

"This was no ordinary plane ride. No longer grounded for battery problems, United's Dreamliner 787 Flight 1 gained takeoff speed down a Houston runway Monday, en route to Chicago O'Hare. After months of concern about the 787's future, the excitement and tension was palpable aboard the first domestic commercial flight since January 16. In Seats 32 J, K, and L, Charles Marine, his wife Amira and 6-year-old son Dominic were going home after visiting the Lone Star State. Dominic, wearing a red T-shirt and headphones, chewed gum with a serious look on his face as the plane raced toward the end of the runway.  Amira had a pillow on her lap, her hands folded as she faced forward. At one point, her husband placed his hand on hers. The plane, carrying 219 passengers including many reporters and executives from Boeing and United, began to lift into the air. Outside the Dreamliner's oversized windows, it was clear the plane's wings were bending upward. Dreamliner interactive: The Boeing 787 layout . Watching the wings of an airliner bend during takeoff might be a little bit disturbing for most passengers. But the wings of this plane are made mostly of carbon reinforced plastic. They're supposed to bend. Then, Dreamliner's wheels magically left the Earth. That triggered passenger applause that rang throughout the aircraft. The 787 was back in domestic service after being grounded because of fears of onboard lithium-ion battery fires. Two incidents on Japanese 787s in January prompted the FAA to ground all six U.S. Dreamliners, which are all operated by United. Engineers designed a fix of the system which involved insulating the batteries and putting them in a ventilated armor-plated box to protect the rest of the plane. Dreamliner returns: Five things to know . 'It's a relaunch!' Dreamliner ""was a fairly expensive piece of sculpture to have on the ground,"" joked United CEO Jeff Smisek during a pre-flight ceremony. The average list price for a 787 is currently about $207 million. His counterpart at manufacturer Boeing apologized. ""We're very sorry about the delay caused by the technology workaround,"" said Boeing CEO Jim McNerney. ""Safety means everything to us."" Both men were passengers on Flight 1. In Seat 21J, Michael Reynolds, 64, was headed home after his oldest granddaughter's high school graduation ceremony. He had no idea he was booked on arguably the most-watched airliner in America, touted by Boeing as the ""airplane of the future."" ""It was a surprise to see the media circus,"" he said. Charles Marine also was in the dark about the flight until he arrived at the gate. Was he concerned about the battery problems? ""I guess there's a little bit of something in the back of my mind,"" he said. But to have all these CEOs on the plane,"" he said he felt safe. Aviation enthusiasts call it Dreamliner 2.0. Others call it Reboot: 787. ""It's a relaunch!"" said a United flight attendant wearing the name tag,  Alejandro. ""That's what they told us to call it!"" Up in the cockpit, Capt. Niels Olufsen clocked it at about Mach .85 -- or 85% of the speed of sound. The plane beat about 10 minutes off other airliners by the time it hit Chicago traffic. The slick new cockpit display allows pilots to more easily see maps, speed and altitude data. ""It's easier to fly because we have better displays,"" said Capt. Bill Blocker, another pilot on Flight 1. ""It lands nice, it flies nice, it's real responsive, it's actually one of the easier planes I've ever flown."" It also soars higher than other airliners. Flight 1 maxed out at 41,000 feet -- which actually is 2,000 feet below its limit. A typical airliner altitude is around 30,000 feet up. But Dreamliner's most important trick is to save on fuel expense. Surprisingly, it takes less fuel to fly high. ""That's just how jet engines work,"" said Capt. Michael Barksdale, another United pilot who attended the pre-flight ceremony. All airlines love to save fuel. That's good for business -- and the environment. And it's why Dreamliner is seen as the ""airliner of the future."" Thrill of flight . For this aviation enthusiast, the thrill of flying this airplane for the first time involved the bendy, plastic wings as they lifted the plane into the air on take off. At first, it doesn't compute -- it looks so strange -- but then you realize this ain't your daddy's aluminum aircraft. Its cutting edge carbon fiber technology is taking aviation to a new level, where special materials can make magic happen. Dreamliner's cabin pressure is touted as a big relief for passengers who suffer from air sickness. The cabin pressure makes it feel like the equivalent of being at 6,000 feet above sea level, compared with typical airliners which are pressured at 8,000 feet. I didn't notice any difference at all, but I don't suffer from air sickness. Most of us passengers weren't discerning enough to notice the rarefied air, but the airliner's larger windows, complete with ""shades"" made of gel that dims in response to electricity, were easier to spot and appreciate. Now about the seats: They're a comfy 17.3 inches across, which fit me fine, especially after enduring a torturous chair on a commuter plane the previous day. The plane's seats are arranged in three rows of three chairs across, with two aisles. In first class, passengers stretch out on 22-inch wide lay-flat seats in the 2-by-2-by-2 configuration. And what about Dreamliner's other goodies? -- Specially designed cabin lighting to match the time of day . -- Cathedral-like cabin ceilings so high they would be impossible for most people to touch . -- Computers that sense imminent turbulence and command parts of the wing to make appropriate adjustments, smoothing out the ride . A bit of unstable air rocked the plane early in the flight, but it was difficult to know how the plane's anti-turbulence system affected the ride. Airliner of the future? The battery problems have been addressed, but the real proof of a successful fix will be in incident-free flights across the globe. With that kind of smooth flying, is the door still open for Dreamliner to realize its promise as the game-changing airliner of the future? Can global aviation titans Boeing and United put the 787's troubled battery system behind them? Two battery overheating incidents on 787s sparked fears of possible inflight fires, prompting an announcement three months ago yanking all 50 Dreamliners out of service worldwide. Some experts dismissed the battery problems as hiccups, glitches or teething pains that all new airliners experience. Glitch or not -- it was the first FAA grounding of an entire airliner model in more than 30 years. Supporters hailed the move as an abundance of caution. Two weeks into the grounding, Japanese carrier ANA said it had lost $15 million. In April, Boeing wouldn't reveal how much the grounding was costing them, but it was ""minimal."" For many of the thousands of employees at Boeing and United who saw their futures tied to this plane, the grounding order was more than a little unnerving. Of course, passengers were nervous too. Grounding an airliner opens the door to damaging its reputation for safety, say experts. The previous FAA grounding in 1979 followed the terrible crash of the now-defunct DC-10 wide-body airliner. American Airlines Flight 191 crashed on takeoff from O'Hare and killed 273 people. Authorities grounded the DC-10 for about a month until it could be determined that maintenance issues were to blame for the crash. The DC-10 suffered an image problem after that, said Capt. Kevin Hiatt, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an independent aviation safety think tank, but that perception faded and the DC-10 went on to be relatively successful. The FAA's abundance of caution shouldn't be allowed to damage the Dreamliner's image, say experts, who point out that no one has been hurt in any of the Dreamliner incidents. ""It's a safe airliner to get back on and fly,"" said Hiatt. Travelers, he said, should be very confident. Under strict oversight, the FAA delegates certain certification activities to qualified experts, Boeing says on its website.  The battery fix included a team of Boeing battery engineers and experts from outside the company. FlyersRights.org President Paul Hudson wants an independent analysis of Boeing's battery fix. He said federal authorities are ""simply taking Boeing's word for it"" that the problem has been resolved and by delegating certification authority. ""We think they made a mistake."" ""There's never been any proof that self-certification ever resulted in a problem in an aircraft,"" said John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, the nation's top aviation investigation agency. Hiatt is also comfortable with the process as it pertains to Dreamliner. But his group supports the idea that the FAA self-certification system should be reviewed, to bolster its safety. Dreamliner's days of being the next big thing may be numbered. Snapping at Boeing's heels is its arch rival Airbus, which is expected to start test flying its A350 XWB later this year. In the wake of Boeing's lithium-ion battery challenges, Airbus decided not to go with the same technology in the new plane -- opting instead for traditional -- and heavier -- nickel-cadmium batteries. Airbus rolls out sleek, new A350 XWB . Shortly after it was grounded, United said flyers would ""flock back"" to the game changing aircraft after the battery problems were fixed. For United and domestic travelers, the game started all over again on Monday. We'll see how much things change. And we'll keep you posted.","First domestic commercial Dreamliner flight since grounding was completed on Monday .

"Food banks across the country kicked into high gear for the holiday season this week in an effort to feed America's hungry. But a few instead homed in on an often overlooked casualty of hard times -- the family pet. ""It's the forgotten pets that go by the wayside,"" said Ann King, founder of an Atlanta-based nonprofit group called Save Our Pets Food Bank. Appalled by tales of pet owners compelled to hand over their cats and dogs to shelters, King formed her organization in 2008 in an effort to provide cash-strapped owners a way to keep their canine and feline friends. Each year, between 3 million and 4 million cats and dogs in shelters are euthanized, according to The Humane Society of the United States, a Washington-based animal advocacy group. ""I've had people say to me, 'I'm down to my last half bag (of pet food) and I don't know what to do,'"" King said. ""People sometimes just cry because they need help."" But King, also the pet food bank's executive director, said that unlike traditional food banks, her group doesn't typically benefit from a resource boost around the holidays. ""Most people don't think to give to us and funding is a big problem,"" she said. ""A lot of the homeless shelters also don't allow pets. So a lot people often just drive up to the local animal control centers and push their dogs out,"" unable to feed them, she added. Some people, out of work or under-employed, are forced to live in their cars but still refuse to say goodbye to their animal companions, she noted. ""They don't want to turn their pets over to shelters, because many of the shelters are full and (their pets) will be put to sleep,"" King said. ""People don't realize that pets, they're family too."" One such family member is a 12-year-old German shepherd named Giorgio -- a favorite of Nadine Turner's late husband, who died of prostate cancer more than a decade ago. ""He loved that dog,"" said Turner, 57, who became homeless earlier this year after moving to Atlanta in search of work. ""He's the last link that I have to my husband. ""Whatever I do, I have to do my best to keep him alive."" Turner, a former business owner and insurance broker from Oakland, California, said she lost her business in 2009. Bunking with friends, she was ultimately forced to camp out on a park bench with her dog near a Kroger food market in downtown Atlanta. ""No shelter would take me and that dog,"" she said. She eventually turned to King's organization, which paid a week's motel bills, plus Giorgio's food and medicine. ""I now have a job lined up with another Insurance company,"" as well a prospective apartment for rent, noted Turner. But she still must find a way to pay a $350 deposit. ""If I can't, me and Giorgio will be back in front of that Kroger's."" Turner's story is not unusual, noted King, whose group currently works with about 500 other food banks nationwide. She also partners with corporations such Del Monte and Mars, as well as the Halo Pet Foundation, headed by comedian and talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres. Since 2008, King's organization has swelled to more than 30 volunteers. And through corporate and private donors, it's shelled out more than a million pounds of pet food, trucking and mailing the donations to thousands of down-on-their-luck families. Nationwide networks, such as Rescue Bank -- with which King is affiliated -- have helped to connect the efforts of like-minded organizations. ""Rescue Bank is doing for pets what the food bank network has successfully done for people in this country for more than 40 years,"" said Debra Fair, vice president at Mars Petcare US.  ""This partnership is the perfect way to give much-needed support to the shelter and rescue communities and change the lives of homeless pets everywhere.""","Ann King is the founder of an Atlanta-based nonprofit group called Save Our Pets Food Bank .

"Ballistic tests show bullets that killed a suburban Washington woman last month are similar to those in two other unsolved killings, police in Virginia said Thursday. ""We are looking at these as if they are linked, but until we have evidence that points to only one suspect, we investigate all possibilities,"" Alexandria Police Chief Earl Cook said at a news conference. The slayings have alarmed the community located across the Potomac River from the nation's capital, raising concerns a serial killer may be responsible. Authorities Thursday renewed their warnings to residents to be ""on guard,"" after announcing their findings from the forensic examinations. The new evidence shows bullets recovered in the killing of music teacher Ruthanne Lodato on February 6 have ""the same general rifling class and characteristics and are similar in design to bullets submitted in two other homicides in the city,'' Cook said. Police have said a gunman knocked on Lodato's door late that morning and began shooting. The 59-year-old woman died, and her mother's caretaker was seriously wounded. The survivor helped provide a sketch of the suspect. The previous victims were also prominent in the area. Nancy Dunning, once married to Alexandria's sheriff, was killed in December 2003; and Ron Kirby, director of transportation planning at the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, was gunned down last November. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the FBI are assisting local police in the investigation, including sending a profiler. Investigators are also reviewing shootings across the nation for any similarities.","Bullets that killed a music teacher are similar to those in two other slayings, police say .

"Russia's tactics in Ukraine are difficult to pin down: The Kremlin categorically denies Russian troops are fighting alongside rebels there, or that the sophisticated weaponry being used against Ukrainian government forces is supplied by Moscow. In fact, there's mounting evidence of both. NATO has released compelling satellite imagery -- dismissed by Moscow -- purporting to show Russian forces crossing the Ukrainian border. Last week, the Ukrainian military even captured 10 Russian paratroopers inside Ukraine. The Kremlin said the troops had accidentally crossed from Russia while patrolling the long, porous border that separates the 2 former Soviet states. But while questions about Russia's tactics remain, its strategy has become more clear: The Kremlin appears to have decided to prevent Ukraine turning West and leaving what Russia regards as its sphere of influence. That means denying Ukraine membership of Western institutions like the European Union, and NATO. What's more, the Kremlin appears determined to achieve its goal regardless of the cost. International sanctions imposed on Russia so far have damaged the country's economy, sending the Ruble to all-time lows against the US dollar, but have had little impact on Kremlin policy. President Vladimir Putin continues his support of the rebels in Ukraine, even increasing it, according to Western officials. And he continues to enjoy soaring popularity, with approval ratings of well over 85%, according to opinion polls. How to stop Putin and prevent a descent into all-out war, then, is the central question with which Western officials are now grappling. There's talk of further ""costs and consequences"" -- the words of President Obama -- but there's division on what further sanctions can achieve. Taking the World Cup away from Russia, chosen to host the next event in 2018, is being discussed and may send a powerful symbolic message of isolation to Moscow. But few expect it would force the Kremlin to change course. READ MORE: Six questions about the crisis in Ukraine . Further economic sanctions would be double-edged, and may work no better than similar previous measures. NATO, the Western military alliance, is meeting this week in Wales and will examine what its response to Russia should be. Ahead of the meeting there's talk of increased military support for Ukraine, and that may yet be delivered; but direct confrontation with a nuclear-armed Russia is regarded by member states, including the EU, as a non-starter. It's simply too risky. President Putin himself summed it up in a speech to a pro-Kremlin youth camp outside Moscow last week, voicing what many of his Western counterparts may well be thinking. ""It's best not to mess with Russia,"" he said. ""Let me remind you, we are a nuclear superpower."" That just leaves diplomacy, so often the last and best option. The good news is that the Russian and Ukrainian presidents met last week for the first time since June. The bad news is that there was only an awkward handshake at the summit in Belarus, and a refusal by either leader to compromise. Russian wants a ceasefire to freeze the conflict, and ultimately a federal constitution in Ukraine that would grant Russian language official status and Russian-speaking areas of the country greater autonomy. Ukraine rejects this, fearing it would mean losing effective control of its Eastern provinces for good. That deadlock will simply have to be broken if this Ukraine crisis is going to end without further bloodshed or territorial losses. EU officials say it's still not too late for Russia to end the crisis without losing face. But with Moscow so clearly digging in its heels, it may be the government in Kiev and its Western backers who, despite the bluster, will be looking to do a face-saving deal.

"Cesar Millan has been showcasing his talents as ""The Dog Whisperer"" since 2004, teaching dog owners how to train their energetic and oftentimes misbehaving canines. Millan gained celebrity status after helping stars such as Oprah Winfrey with their precious pooches, but on his Nat Geo Wild series ""The Dog Whisperer,"" he works with everyday people. Recently in Atlanta, Millan shared his tips for adopting a shelter dog with Sara and Casey Giessen, a married couple who recently decided they are ready to adopt a dog. Millan strongly supports adopting pets, but he warns that taking in a shelter dog based on pity isn't in the best interest of the dog.  Many people choose a dog based on emotion, but Millan recommends a different approach. ""I always suggest to people to be logical with the adoption because you get to understand compatibility and what energy are you bringing home,"" he said.  ""It's hard because most of the time people do impulse adoptions, but unfortunately those dogs are brought back more often than kept at home."" He said compatibility starts with understanding a dog's body language, beginning with the eyes. ""It's the softness of the eye contact that can tell you a lot [because] they can tell you sadness, as much as it can tell you, 'I'm open for a relationship.' Or they can tell you, 'I don't want to be with you,'"" he explained.  ""Through the eye contact you can know exactly how they feel about your presence."" Millan accompanied the Giessens as they checked out the homeless dogs at DeKalb County Animal Control in Atlanta.  Casey Giessen recounted how Millan helped explain to the couple how they should go about choosing their future pet. ""There were pictures on the cages of the dogs and he would cover the bottom of the face and he said, 'Just look at the eyes,'"" Casey Giessen said.  ""You could tell immediately [from the eyes] that this dog was sad, extra hyper, or calm and sweet."" Millan said many future pet owners often mistake a high-powered tail wag as happiness. ""That doesn't mean the dog is happy, that means the dog is excited!"" he explained. If you are considering adopting a dog, Millan said you must first assess your own energy level, then look for a dog that matches it. When a dog's energy level is higher than the owner's energy level, it can lead to problems. ""That's when you see people, when they go for a walk, they're being pulled by their dog, or when they open the door, just to answer the doorbell, the dog gets to the door first,"" he explained. Next, he said future dog owners need to consider how they will set boundaries and limitations for their pet. The Giessens, who described their energy level as medium, found a small lab mix at the DeKalb shelter that they liked.  After observing them together, Millan said he believed she was a compatible dog for the couple.  The couple later noticed the dog shedding quite a bit, so, because Sarah has allergies, they decided to continue their search using the advice Millan has shared. That, according to Millan was the right decision. ""My goal was to teach them a little bit more than what they knew,"" Millan said.  ""And what they adopt today was knowledge, maybe not a dog yet, but when they adopt a dog, it will be the right dog for them because they will do it with knowledge."" Millan said after you have adopted a shelter dog, the first thing you need to do before bringing your new pet home is take it for a long, one- to two-hour walk. ""It's like his vacation. It's almost like you're really welcoming him by removing physical energy,"" Millan said.  ""Then you bring him home. Immediately, before you give affection, you tell a dog where he's going to sleep or stay. You begin practicing separation so you don't have separation anxiety in the future."" Millan said the hardest thing for a dog to learn is how to be away from its family. ""We go to work, kids go to school, at one point he will be by himself,"" he explained. ""So, it's best to introduce him to how his life is going to look like in the future from day one. So you don't catch him by surprise."" Understanding dog behavior is key to creating a lasting relationship with a dog, Millan said. ""Follow through with exercise and discipline,"" he said.  ""Everybody wants to pet a dog, but not everybody walks the dog and is consistent with rules, boundaries and limitations. We don't have a problem with breed, with pit bulls, we don't have a problem with aggression, we have a problem with education."" Several weeks after their shelter visit , the Giessens saw a dog available on Facebook. They were drawn to his cute looks and his big ears, but they reminded themselves of Millan's tips. ""We kept saying to each other, we can't get him just because he's cute,"" Sara Giessen said. They found the dog at Georgia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which has a ""spend the night"" program. They were allowed to bring the dog home for a night, which sealed the deal. ""We were really surprised because at the shelter he was really hyperactive,"" Casey said. ""We got him home and he was really chill."" The Giessens credit Millan's advice for leading them to the right dog, which they named ""Beans.""","Cesar Millan is known as the ""dog whisperer"" for his ability to train troubled dogs .

"""Read my lips."" ""Mission accomplished."" ""Definition of 'Is'"" Every modern president has got one -- an inelegant statement, a broken promise, or an outright steaming lie, distilled to a three-second sound bite, that follows them into history. It can be part of a campaign slogan, a policy address or legal testimony. It can be delivered at a party convention, as part of a stump speech, from an aircraft carrier or during a deposition. It can be well-intentioned, misinformed, only untrue after the fact. And the facts can be entirely debatable. But there seems to be a lie or two that follows presidents into the history books. Here is a look at some recent  memorable ones: . 1. 'If you like your health insurance, you can keep it' He's got some time in office left, but Barack Obama's signature gaffe line probably is going to be: ""If you like your health insurance, you can keep it"" It was a key line in selling the Affordable Care Act, which narrowly passed back in 2010. But he has said it since then, too. What he said was true for most Americans. They get their health insurance through their employer or the government with Medicare. But as open enrollment began this month for the fewer than 20% of Americans Obamacare was designed to help, it became clear there is a subset of people who like their health plans and will in fact lose their health plans. These are the subset of Americans who buy their insurance individually and, because those plans don't cover everything Obamacare now says must be covered, will have to get a new health care plan. RELATED: The hidden truth behind early Obamacare numbers: It's not what it seems . Granted, it might be a better health care plan. It might cover more services, like hospital stays, maternity, and mental health. But it also might be more expensive. Obama tweaked the promise after the fact during an appearance in Massachusetts on Wednesday. But it's not exactly going to fit on a bumper sticker any more: . ""Now, if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law and you really liked that plan, you're able to keep it,"" Obama said this week. ""That's what I said when I was running for office. That was part of the promise we made. But ever since the law was passed, if insurers decided to downgrade or cancel these substandard plans, what we said under the law is you've got to replace them with quality, comprehensive coverage  -- because that, too, was a central premise of the Affordable Care Act from the very beginning."" ""And today, that promise means that every plan in the marketplace covers a core set of minimum benefits, like maternity care, and preventive care, and mental health care, and prescription drug benefits, and hospitalization,"" Obama explained. ""And they can't use allergies or pregnancy or a sports injury or the fact that you're a woman to charge you more. They can't do that anymore. They can't do that anymore."" 2. 'Read my lips. No new taxes' George H.W. Bush's was the most devastating. ""Read my lips,"" he declared at the 1988 Republican National Convention. ""No new taxes!"" It was a campaign pledge. And he broke it, big time. Bush didn't want to break the pledge, but in the face of a recession, and to avoid $100 billion in automatic, across-the-board spending cuts, he acquiesced and allowed a tax hike on the wealthy. It was disastrous for Bush. It created a rift in the GOP and directly led to a spirited primary challenge two years later by Pat Buchanan. Bush ended up winning the primary, but losing re-election in a three-way race against Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. 3. Mission Accomplished . George W. Bush never said, ""Mission Accomplished,"" but the banner placed behind him did when he landed on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in a Navy jet and declared that ""major combat operations in Iraq have ended."" They hadn't. In fact they were just getting started. And Bush would have to stake his legacy on a subsequent surge of American troops in Iraq. Bush won re-election in 2004, but the war cost America a great deal in blood and treasure. Fatigue with Iraq contributed greatly to Republicans' losing control of Capitol Hill in 2006. 4. '...Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium...' Some presidents have more than one. The younger Bush will also be remembered for his decision to use public unity following the 9/11 attacks to mount a war in Iraq, and the 16 words he used to justify the action. The case Bush made in his 2003 State of the Union address helped lead the United States into Iraq. He said, ""The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa."" It wasn't true. But that didn't become clear until later after a high-profile scandal involving the leaking of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity by Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff. But the point of the 16 words, more importantly, is that the intelligence used to convince the country that combat operations were necessary to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction was inherently flawed. 5. 'Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.' And not to pile on Bush '43', but in the days just after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast and left much of New Orleans under water, the president came under intense heat for what was seen as a lackluster response by the federal government. On September 2, 2005, just three days after Katrina destroyed the levees and flooded much of New Orleans' Ninth Ward, Bush heaped unusual praise on then-FEMA director Michael Brown during a briefing at the Mobile Regional Airport. The soundbite, ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job,"" would haunt the president and go on to define a perception that Bush was out of touch during one of the worst tragedies in American history. Brown later resigned. 6. 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky...' Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr wasn't originally appointed to investigate Bill Clinton's Oval Office sex life. But somehow that's what it turned into. And without getting too far into the sordid details, the President found himself giving a videotaped deposition in a case regarding sexual harassment charges. The whole definition of sexual relations and the word ""is"" became a thing, the President faced impeachment and was nearly thrown out of office. He survived, but his legacy and his agenda were tarnished. And the list goes on. Ronald Reagan had to admit he didn't know about the Iran-Contra affair.  Jimmy Carter talked to the nation about a ""crisis of confidence"" and was panned for giving a ""malaise"" speech. And Gerald Ford's contention in a debate with Carter that ""There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe"" made him look oblivious to the Soviet Union's political and military control of the region. There are some rules that emerge. If the moment has to do with the economy and it occurs in the first term, there's a good chance the president won't make it to a second term. If it has to do with foreign affairs, it might be just a blip on their legacy. The good news for Obama is that he's been through his last election. The bad news is this demonstrably false new line has everything to do with his signature health law. As it carries on, how Americans react to the implementation of Obamacare could have real consequences on whether his successor is a president who wants to make the law better or gut it.","Many presidents have uttered phrases they later regretted .

"(CNN)As if scripted by Hollywood, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's death on New Year's Day came just hours after his son, Andrew, was sworn in to a second term in the same office.  It was a storybook ending to a larger than life career and personality that raised enduring questions about whether Cuomo's style of big-hearted, big-state liberalism can win the White House. Mario Cuomo was famous for the idealism he expressed in soaring oratory, but he had a prickly practical side as well. Cuomo, the political infighter, was famously combative: He frequently picked fights with the press and had a contentious relationship with the state legislature that included comparing them to clapping monkeys in one address. In 1977, Cuomo famously ran three races for New York mayor against Ed Koch in a single year, a bitter string of campaigns that included a scurrilous flier suggesting Koch was gay (Koch denied this until his death; Cuomo denied any knowledge of the flier). Cuomo lost all three contests, but bounced back to defeat Koch in the 1982 race for governor. That's when Cuomo began to tantalize his fellow Democrats, many of whom wanted him to lead a liberal counterattack on the conservative Republican philosophy embodied by President Ronald Reagan. An electrifying speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention sent Cuomo to the front ranks of Democratic candidates -- and in 1991, a plane famously idled at a local airport, waiting for a go-ahead to rush paperwork to New Hampshire that would have enrolled him in the 1992 presidential primary. In the end, after extended deliberations that earned him the nickname ""Hamlet on the Hudson,"" Cuomo opted not to run for president, and in 1993 he turned down an all-but-engraved invitation by President Clinton to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court. The consensus among New York's political class is that Cuomo avoided the national stage due to personal doubts and hesitations; As one observer put it, ""Cuomo simply did not trust enough people to build the kind of staff needed to run an effective national campaign."" But the question remains: Would America have been ready to elect an unabashed liberal? And is the country ready to do so now? At a time when income inequality has far surpassed even the startling differences of the 1980s, liberalism shows signs of revival. After 20 years of electing Republican mayors, New York City voters in 2013 chose Bill de Blasio, whose promise to close the gap between rich and poor was embodied in a line -- a ""tale of two cities"" -- taken directly from Cuomo's 1984 speech. Cuomo's son, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, used his inaugural speech to focus on national issues: He included talk of raising the minimum wage and boasts about being the first big state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage and implement tough restrictions on gun ownership. Andrew Cuomo said his father, on what turned out to be his deathbed, had reviewed the speech.  ""He said it was a good speech,"" Andrew said. A hint, perhaps, of things to come.","Errol Louis: Mario Cuomo's death a reminder of when a strong liberal mulled presidential run .
He says Cuomo's son,  N.Y.'s governor, also eyes presidency. Can liberalism make comeback?"
"The exact number of exonerated American prisoners is unknown. But data gathered by university law schools indicates it's more than 2,000. Fascinating details surrounding some of these exonerations set them apart from the rest. Here are five recent exonerations that made headlines. 1. Michael Morton . The subject of a CNN film, Michael Morton wasn't home when his wife, Christine, was beaten to death in front of their 3-year-old son at their Austin, Texas-area home in 1986. But a prosecutor said the evidence suggested otherwise. The problem was, the jury was prevented from hearing all the evidence in the case. Wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, a team of loyal supporters and DNA evidence helped Morton win his freedom in 2011. Last month, Morton's former prosecutor pleaded no contest to a court order to show cause regarding evidence that was not used in the trial. Read more about Michael Morton's story . 2. Brian Banks and the incredible twist . At age 17, fearing a potentially long sentence, college football hopeful Brian Banks followed the advice of his attorney and pleaded no contest to assaulting a Long Beach, California, high school classmate in 2002. Banks maintained his innocence throughout nearly six years of imprisonment, subsequent probation and registration as a sex offender. But in 2011, the case took an incredible twist when the alleged victim sent Banks a Facebook friend request. According to the California Innocence Project, the woman later admitted that Banks had not kidnapped or raped her during a consensual encounter at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where Banks was a middle linebacker with a scholarship offer from the University of Southern California. Read more about Banks' story . 3. Douglas Prade and the bite marks . In 1997, former Akron, Ohio, police captain Douglas Prade was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife, Margo Prade, a popular doctor. Her gunshot-riddled body was found in her vehicle in her office parking lot. No murder weapon was found and prosecutors produced no witnesses to the killing. The main evidence against Prade was a bite mark on the victim's arm and lab coat that a prosecution expert matched to Prade's teeth. DNA tests conducted at the time were inconclusive. With help from the University of Cincinnati's Innocence Project, Prade appealed the conviction. In 2010, Prade won an Ohio Supreme Court ruling that allowed retesting of DNA evidence using newer methods. When the results came back, none of the DNA evidence could be matched to Prade. Read more about Prade's case . 4. Clarence Harrison and the wristwatch . If police had never heard about a wristwatch that Clarence Harrison had for sale, perhaps he never would have been wrongly convicted of rape. He never would have lost 17 years serving time in a Georgia prison. In 1986 a woman was raped and her wristwatch was stolen, according to the Innocence Project. Neighbors told police that Harrison lived near the victim and that he had a wristwatch for sale. Police searched Harrison's home and didn't find the watch. But the victim identified Harrison in a photo lineup as her attacker. Blood tests pointed to Harrison as the possible attacker. But the testing was incorrect, the Innocence Project later said. It wasn't until 2004 that DNA testing proved Harrison could not have committed the crime. Harrison was freed. More about Harrison . 5. James Bain, longest serving exoneree . Of the hundreds of U.S. prisoners exonerated by DNA tests, none has served more time behind bars than James Bain, according to the Innocence Project. Now free, Bain will never regain the 35 years he spent in Florida's prison system. In 1974, a 9-year-old boy was taken from his bedroom and raped on a baseball field in Lake Wales, Florida. The boy later told police his attacker had bushy sideburns and a mustache. After being shown five photos of potential suspects, the victim picked out a photo of Bain, according to a police report. Bain was 19 when he was convicted on charges of kidnapping, burglary and strong-arm rape. He received a life sentence. In 2001, Florida passed a statute allowing cases to be reopened for DNA testing. Four times Bain submitted handwritten motions seeking such testing. Each time he was denied. After an appeals court ruled he was entitled to a hearing, Bain's fifth motion was successful. Finally, after DNA testing proved negative, Bain was set free in 2009. He was 54 years old. ""I'm not angry,"" Bain told reporters.

"After piling up trillions of dollars of war debt during the last decade, America seemed to be on the brink of a new era -- ready to shut off the Iraq-Afghanistan funding faucet, bring its troops home and enjoy a peace dividend. But the respite looks like it will be brief.  The new security threats around the world are leading to renewed calls for military engagement: maybe not boots on the ground but air strikes, drones and weapons and training for shadowy opposition groups. With Iraq descending into chaos and ISIS beheading Americans, the public is alarmed not only at the prospect of getting dragged back into the fray, but also wondering if the economy can withstand any more. Of course, in purely financial terms, the U.S. can easily pay for whatever it takes.  Patrolling the no-fly zones over Iraq during the 1990s after the first Gulf War cost around $12 billion a year. Training the opposition and protecting civilians in Syria, combined with a weighty air campaign to take on both ISIS and the Assad regime, would cost some $20-22 billion per year, according to an estimate by Ken Pollack from the Washington-based Brookings Institution. These are small numbers compared to the nearly $200 billion the U.S. has been shelling out each year for the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.  And the U.S is still a rich country; interest rates are low and borrowing is cheap. Iraq, Afghan legacy . Despite all of this, the cost of re-engaging in conflict will be heavy. The country is still digging itself out from the financial hole created by the extraordinarily expensive Iraq and Afghan wars. In addition to the trillions appropriated for war spending, the regular Pentagon budget grew by $1.3 trillion in constant dollars since 2001 to the highest levels in real terms since World War II.  This ""culture of endless money,"" as former Defense Secretary Robert Gates called it, was notoriously wasteful, with accounting systems so flawed it was impossible to track where all the money was being spent. Withdrawal from Iraq and the expected departure from Afghanistan was supposedly a prelude to belt-tightening at the Pentagon. Congress enacted measures designed to cut military spending by some $540 billion over the next decade. Thanks in part to the budget ""sequester"" of 2011, the Pentagon announced deep cuts in almost all areas, including shrinking the size of the army from 520,000 to 440,000 troops, paring back military pay raises and benefits, buying fewer weapons and attempting to clean up its finances. Reform efforts on hold . However, the sharp deterioration in the global security situation means that reform efforts are now being quietly shelved. Even before the latest setbacks in Iraq there was little appetite in the military to carry on with the unaccustomed austerity.  Military circles have been warning darkly about the ""hollow force"" -- the idea that cutbacks would mean lower readiness and sub-par forces. Respected Pentagon figures such as former Under Secretary for Policy Michèle Flournoy are warning that future budget cuts will harm the U.S. military's ability to carry out its missions. Any talk of improving the national balance sheet through deeper military cutbacks has all but disappeared. For the nation as a whole, this means the loss of a potential peace dividend windfall of the kind the U.S. enjoyed after the end of the Cold War, which helped boost domestic prosperity during the Clinton years. Instead, military spending looks sure to rebound, prolonging the shortage of money needed to fix roads, rebuild bridges and repair schools. Desperately needed Pentagon reforms are likely to be put on hold, as Congress and top defense officials continue to focus on foreign military engagements. A dozen years of war have left American national finances in need of serious repair. The U.S. already borrowed some $2 trillion to pay for the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, a major contributor to the growth in the national debt from $6.4 trillion in 2003 to $17.7 trillion today. The war also contributed to a sharp rise in oil prices, which increased from $25 barrel in 2003 to a peak of $140 in 2008, significantly constraining U.S. flexibility to respond to the financial crisis, (which is by no means over).  And the country hasn't yet paid for one of the biggest costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts: medical care and disability compensation for the 2.5 million veterans who served there.  Already more than 900,000 returning service members have been awarded disability benefits for the rest of their lives, which will cost an additional trillion dollars in the coming decades, according to the Veterans Benefit Administration. Despite two failed wars it seems the country hasn't learned the lessons about the huge cost of military adventures and the limits to what military intervention alone can do to solve complex foreign policy challenges. In 2003, the U.S. ignored the question of how it would pay for the Iraq war. The Bush administration was so confident of a short campaign that it fired its top economist, Lawrence Lindsey, for suggesting the conflict might be expensive. This time around, America is starting off in a much weaker financial position, with no strategy to pay for our existing war debts. If it is to embark on another round of military engagements, the president needs to be up front with the American people about what it will cost -- and how they are going to pay for it.","New security threats are leading to renewed calls for U.S. military engagement .

"Skywatchers will be setting their alarm clocks for the early morning hours Thursday when the annual Quadrantid meteor shower peaks. This year's show in the sky may not produce as many highlights for some viewers because of light from the moon, NASA said in a statement. Meteor watchers can expect to see 60 to 200 meteors an hour streak across the sky, NASA said. Bill Cooke, the head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, said by e-mail that the shooting stars would be visible after about 11 p.m. in each time zone in the United States, with the best viewing time from 3 a.m. until dawn. The Quadrantids were first noted in 1825 and got their name from the constellation of Quadrans Muralis, which is no longer considered a constellation by astronomers, according to NASA. The material that is burning up in Earth's atmosphere during the Quadrantids likely comes from a comet that broke into fragments centuries ago, NASA says. ""After hundreds of years orbiting the sun, they will enter our atmosphere at 90,000 mph, burning up 50 miles above Earth's surface,"" NASA said. The space agency said observers at latitudes north of 51 degrees south should be able to see the meteor shower. NASA and Ustream will have a webcast from Wednesday through Friday with one view of the meteor shower. The camera is mounted in Huntsville, Alabama, at the Marshall Space Flight Center.","NASA says best time to watch is between 3 a.m. and dawn .
The Quadrantid meteor shower will peak early Thursday morning .
The Quadrantids enter the atmosphere each January, burning up at 90,000 mph .

"Fear is something that consumes all of us at one time or another. What matters is whether you let your fear control you or parts of your decision-making? And if so, is fear something we can improve upon? Before I was selected to be a part of Fit Nation, I was afraid of flying. Let me rephrase that -- I was scared to death of flying. What could possibly go wrong? Many things ran through my head. A plane crash. Oxygen deprivation. A panic attack. Another fear I had was swimming in large bodies of water. I knew how to swim; I grew up with a pool at my house. I was very comfortable swimming in a pool because I could see the bottom. You can't see the bottom of the ocean when you swim in it. What could possibly go wrong? A shark attack. Oxygen deprivation. A panic attack. I came to realize that I was missing out on things because of my fears. I would only vacation in places I could drive to. In fact, last October, my partner Joy and I drove 14 hours to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for a long weekend. We could have gotten a sweet rate on round-trip airfare and had more time at the beach, but I elected to drive instead. I was beyond excited when I was selected for Fit Nation in December. But fear quickly took over when I realized that not only did Fit Nation involve swimming in the ocean but also two trips to California (somewhere beyond even my driving desire). I was scared. Yet I wanted to be part of Fit Nation so badly that I knew I would have to meet both of these fears head on. In January, I was scheduled to fly to Atlanta for kick-off weekend. As the days got closer, I grew more anxious. People began to tell me stories about their first flying experience; some had flown as children, unaccompanied, to visit family. Another friend told me she traveled often for her job; she flew more than 140 times last year. I began to wonder what could possibly go wrong. Seeing another part of the country? Visiting people I hadn't seen in years? Finishing a triathlon? I came to realize that I was looking at the worst possible scenario instead of the best-case scenario. I decided that I had to take a chance. Fortunately for me, my first flight was a short one. I kept telling myself that millions of people fly every day and nothing happens -- except that they get to their desired destinations and go about their business. I have now flown four different times, including cross-country twice. And I have found that I actually enjoy flying. During our midway training trip in California, we started our swim training in a lap pool. I could see the bottom; I was in control; no problem. Then came our first training session in the ocean. I was nervous -- sweaty palms and all, as I listened to our instructions. But as my coach explained dolphin diving (a technique used by swimmers to get under a wave) I began to feel a sense of confidence. It was almost as if I knew what I had to do, and there wasn't anything that was going to stop me. Was my fear of the ocean, or of the unknown? People who have swum less than me had completed this challenge; what was holding me back? One of the lifeguards set a buoy at 150 yards. My teammate and I swam out to it without any problems. I remember treading water, talking to him, thinking: ""I just swam 150 yards out into the ocean. This isn't bad."" Over the next few days, I completed four different swims in the Pacific Ocean, including a mock triathlon distance of 400 yards. Can your fears go away? I feel completely different about flying and swimming in the ocean than I did a year ago. I actually enjoy flying now and look forward to heading back to sunny California in September. Although something can be said for long car trips with your family, I think back to the hours that could have been spent relaxing and enjoying vacation instead of being behind the wheel. I also look forward to swimming once again in the Pacific Ocean. I wouldn't say I'm a risk-taker, but I think I am more willing to take a chance on things now. One of my favorite quotes I say to my athletes is, ""If you do what you always do, you get what you always get."" Don't let your fears stand in your way of ""getting"" something more! You have more to lose than pounds . Why I gave up soda .","Mike Wilber was afraid of flying and of swimming in the ocean .

"Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 likely flew into the southern Indian Ocean on autopilot with an unresponsive crew, Australian authorities said Thursday, divulging new details about what they believe happened during the missing plane's final hours. The information emerged as officials announced a southward shift, as expected, in the underwater search for the Boeing 777, which disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board. Searchers have found no trace of the jetliner or its passengers, making the case probably the biggest mystery in aviation history and leaving the families of those on board bereft of answers. The Australian officials said they believe the plane was on autopilot throughout its journey over the Indian Ocean until it ran out of fuel. They cited the straight track on which the aircraft flew, according to electronic ""handshakes"" it periodically exchanged with satellites. ""It is highly, highly likely that the aircraft was on autopilot, otherwise it could not have followed the orderly path that has been identified through the satellite sightings,"" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss told reporters in Canberra. Unresponsive crew? In a report explaining the change in search area, Australian authorities suggested that Flight 370's crew may have been in an ""unresponsive"" state, possibly caused by a lack of oxygen. That scenario ""appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of MH370's flight,"" the report said, citing previous air accidents in which crews had been rendered unresponsive by a lack of oxygen, also known as hypoxia. But it cautioned that the assumption was ""made for the purposes of defining a search area and there is no suggestion that the investigation authority will make similar assumptions."" The Australian officials declined to talk about the causes behind Flight 370's errant flight path, saying those are questions for the Malaysian authorities in charge of the overall investigation. And they said they weren't sure exactly when the autopilot had been turned on. 'Most likely place' Their disclosure that a computer rather than a human was most likely steering the plane during its final hours adds a little more detail to the largely obscured picture of what took place that March night. But the key questions of why the passenger jet flew dramatically off its intended route -- from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing -- and where exactly it ended up remain unanswered. The next phase of the underwater search aims to resolve at least one of those issues. Truss said an international team of experts had chosen the 60,000-square-kilometer zone, an area roughly the size of West Virginia, after going over all the available data. ""This site is the best available and most likely place where the aircraft is resting,"" he said. He warned, though, that the operation to comb the sea floor in the area, which has never been fully mapped, would be ""very challenging and complex."" ""We could be fortunate and find it in the first hour, or the first day,"" he said. ""But it could take another twelve months."" Biggest search in history . The hunt for the plane has already become ""biggest search operation in history, covering 4.5 million square kilometers of ocean surface,"" Truss said. During the early phase of the search, aircraft and ships scoured vast stretches of the surface of the southern Indian Ocean but found no debris from Flight 370. Pings initially thought to be from the missing plane's flight recorders led to a concentrated underwater search that turned up nothing. Last week, a group of independent experts -- using satellite data publicly released in May -- said it thought the missing aircraft was hundreds of miles southwest of the previous underwater search site. Doubts among families . ""It is encouraging that the Australian leadership has taken a very methodical and rigorous approach to redefining the search area, but is it still different than some of the other outside experts had defined,"" said Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was on board the missing plane. She said she couldn't reconcile the differences between the analyses. ""We don't trust that the officials are being forthright with the information,"" she said. The next underwater search will be broadly in an area where planes and vessels had already looked for debris on the surface of the water, Truss said. It's roughly 1,800 kilometers off the coast of Western Australia. Two ships have already started mapping the ocean floor of the area, a process that will take about three months. The underwater search, which will rely on the ships' maps, is expected to begin in August. It will be led by a private contractor that Australian authorities will appoint. Malaysia will contribute equipment to the search effort, including vessels and towed sonar systems, Truss said.

"Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. soldier held captive for five years by militants before his release a month ago, has ventured several times off an Army base in Texas as part of the effort to get him used to everyday life in America, a military spokeswoman said. His release on May 31 in exchange for five Taliban being held by the U.S. military has rankled some, including former members of his unit, who said he was a deserter who endangered colleagues searching for him. Yet while investigating circumstances surrounding his departure, the military has also said it's focused on making sure Bergdahl gets better mentally and physically, so he can gradually readjust to normal life. Since being freed, Bergdahl has been carefully monitored at a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, and his home since June 13, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston. He recently transitioned from inpatient care at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas to outpatient care, the Army said on June 22. Still, Bergdahl has hardly left the care of military health professionals. Members of his reintegration team escort him whenever he leaves base and interacts with the public, the Army spokeswoman said. His stops have included a library, a supermarket and several stores of his choosing. Bergdahl has also eaten at fast-food and sit-down restaurants. The Army sergeant is encouraged to pick the places, but because he's not from San Antonio, he is offered some advice. ""Sometimes they sit at the table with him,"" the Army spokeswoman said of those on Bergdahl's reintegration team who accompany him. ""... Other times, they hang in the background."" During his trips off-base, Bergdahl sometimes wears civilian clothing and others times dresses in his military uniform. In some instances while he has been in uniform, members of the public have recognized him and shaken his hand, according to the Army spokeswoman. His reintegration phase will end sometime in the next several weeks, an Army official said. He will then be assigned to an Army unit, according to the official, though details of his next stop have not been disclosed. Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. But there was no definitive conclusion Bergdahl was a deserter because that would require knowing his intent, something officials couldn't learn without talking to him, a U.S. military official told CNN last month. Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl is leading the Army's formal Bergdahl investigation, which will review previous findings. The two-star general could ask to re-interview anyone who can shed light on the case; talking to Bergdahl himself would likely be the last step in this investigation, one official said. As of the middle of last week, the soldier hadn't been interviewed by investigators nor did he have a lawyer, one official said. Military officials have talked to Bergdahl about the days and years after his capture as part of the reintegration process. ""We have no reason to believe that he engaged in any misconduct during that period of time,"" one official said late last month, referring to Bergdahl's time in captivity. No lawyer yet for Bergdahl even though probe underway . Who was swapped for Bergdahl?

"President Obama slipped into the role of comedian-in-chief Saturday night and took jabs at journalists, lawmakers, celebrities and -- most pointedly -- his own administration's botched rollout of HealthCare.gov. Remarks that would have otherwise put him in hot water drew applause at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner from an audience comprising some of the most famous faces in politics, entertainment and sports. The dinner is known in Washington circles as ""nerd prom."" ""Of course, we rolled out HealthCare.gov,"" Obama said of his tough year in 2013. ""That could have gone better."" ""In 2008, my slogan was 'Yes we can.' In 2013, my slogan was control-alt-delete,"" Obama said. A poster for Walt Disney's animated hit ""Frozen"" flashed onto the large video screens in the ballroom, to which the president quipped that the launch of the online enrollment portal of Obamacare had been turned into one of the year's biggest movies. After tickling funny bones with 20 minutes worth of jokes, Obama returned to the troubled rollout. Sebilius self-depricates . The president said he'd prepared a separate, short video thanking the White House Correspondents' Association for all their hard work as the organization celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2014. When the video choked and froze, Obama called out for help. ""Does anybody know how to fix this?"" Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who was bitterly criticized over the HealthCare.gov botch, rushed up to join Obama onstage. ""I got this. I see it all the time,"" Sebelius said, as she appeared to set a small laptop down on the podium. Sebelius punched in a few keystrokes in dramatic fashion, and Obama's video began to play as originally intended. Comedian and actor Joel McHale, who spoke after Obama as the evening's entertainment, also targeted the once-troubled Obamacare site. ""The launch of HealthCare.gov was a disaster. It was so bad,"" McHale said, speaking directly to the President. ""I don't even have an analogy because the website is now the thing people use to describe other bad things. ""They say things like, 'I shouldn't have eaten that sushi, because I was up all night HealthCare.gov-ing.'"" The president and McHale also used fodder from current headlines for many of their best moments of the night. Here are some of the highlights. Christie's bridge troubles . After taking a jab at drawn out legislative battles with Washington lawmaker Ted Cruz, Obama joked that ""gridlock has gotten so bad in this town, you have to wonder: What'd we do to piss off Chris Christie so bad?"" ""Finally, a politician who is willing to stand up to America's commuters,"" McHale said of Christie, who chuckled along in the audience. Shirtless Putin . Obama sought to turn recent conservative criticism of his foreign policy on its head by pointing out past compliments Putin has received from Pat Buchanan and Rudy Giuliani. In a dig at conservative pundits, Obama said, ""Mike Huckabee and Sean Hannity keep talking about Putin's bare chest -- which is kind of weird. Look it up. They talk about it a lot."" McHale used the crisis in Ukraine to give Obama some foreign policy advice. ""You have to show a guy like that you're just as crazy as he is. He invades Crimea, you invade Cancun,"" the comedian told the President. Dousing the news media . Both men used the occasion to declare open season on the media, including CNN and its recent extensive coverage of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Obama told the audience he was a little jet-lagged from his recent trip to Asia which included a stop in Malaysia. ""The lengths we have to go to, to get CNN coverage these days,"" the President said, adding, ""I think they're still searching for their table."" McHale was no kinder. After remarking that the White House Correspondents' Association celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, McHale joked, ""100 years ago, CNN was only searching for the Wright brothers' plane."" Obama also took a shot at MSNBC's ratings in the large, full ballroom. ""MSNBC is here. They're a little overwhelmed. They've never seen an audience this big before."" As for Fox News, the President joked that the cable outlet was a front for the Koch brothers, a pair of billionaire industrialists known for their monetary contributions to conservative groups and causes. ""I'm just kidding,"" Obama added, ""Let's face it, Fox. You'll miss me when I'm gone. It'll be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya."" Racial tightrope walk . Obama played on skin color while taking a stab at House Speaker John Boehner, who has antagonized Obama on many issues in the last few years and who has his own host of problems with the conservative members of the House Republican Caucus. ""These days the House Republicans actually give John Boehner a harder time than they give me -- which means orange really is the new black,"" Obama said making a simultaneous reference to the popular Netflix series and to Boehner's legendary tan. McHale walked the tightrope on race in a quip that is apt to draw some criticism when the sun comes up Sunday. The comedian is the host of ""The Soup"" on the E! Entertainment channel. ""E! is also home to the Kardashians, who believe it or not, are Republicans,"" McHale said, ""And I know that because they're always trying to screw black people."" The joke seemed to draw more smarting moans from the audience than laughs. Some serious stuff . Although the night is typically a light-hearted affair full of jokes, food, and posing for photos, discussion of serious news intruded on the red carpet. News legend Barbara Walters spoke to CNN about her exclusive interview with V. Stiviano, the woman at the center of the racial scandal that has embroiled L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling. ""I think she wanted to do it,"" Walters told CNN when asked how she landed a sit-down with Stiviano, ""I think she wanted to be heard. I think she feels there have been a lot of bad things said about her and this was her chance to show that she was intelligent."" The annual event, which has attracted a substantial Hollywood contingent since Bill Clinton was President in the early 1990s, is taking place this year at a time when politically themed shows -- ABC's ""Scandal,"" HBO's ""Veep"" and Netflix's ""House of Cards"" -- are prevalent in popular culture. CNN Political Commentator Ben Ferguson summed up how the annual event seemed to upend pop culture's normal pecking order. ""This is the only place where Wolf Blitzer can actually be the hot ticket for a Hollywood star. . .  This is like revenge of every guy who ever went and studied hard in college,"" Ferguson said. ""In what world does this happen?"" As to whether partisanship gets stirred up, S.E. Cupp of CNN's ""Crossfire"" said, ""Actually, tonight we've decided to put politics aside, laugh at our own expense, rib each other, and just have a good night."" ""That's what this is all about,"" CNN Political Analyst John Avlon said of the rare truce between the hosts on the left and the right of program. ""There's so much humor in politics but you wouldn't know it because people don't laugh at it,"" he said, ""so it's a good night for that."" ""This is Hollywood for ugly people,"" Avlon added, using a familiar description Washingtonians often use to describe their city. Also spotted on the red carpet by CNN before the dinner began: ""Scandal's"" Tony Goldwyn, Scott Foley, Joe Morton, Bellamy Young and Dan Bucatinsky; Sens. Charles Schumer, D-New York, and John McCain, R-Arizona; Attorney General Eric Holder; Cynthia Nixon; Patrick Stewart; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar; Washington ""fixer"" Judy Smith; Tim Tebow; Frida Pinto; IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde; Katie Couric; Richard Marx and the Winklevoss twins. Also in attendance were CNN's Jim Acosta, Michelle Kosinski, Dana Bash and Brianna Keilar. The annual event is a fundraiser for ""scholarships for aspiring journalists and awards recognizing excellence in the (journalism) profession,"" according to the website of the White House Correspondents' Association, the organization that sponsors the dinner. The WHCA ""works to maintain independent news media coverage of the president, advocating for access, handling logistics for pools of reporters who stay close to the president and those who travel with him, and providing scholarships to journalism students,"" the website says. The annual dinner began in 1920.","Joel McHale makes off-color Kardashian joke .

"Dowding (v.): A disturbing, drug-induced experience brought on by the overconsumption of marijuana edibles. Usage: ""Aww man, I ate all those cookies and now I'm dowding, hard."" OK, so ""dowding"" may not be a real word -- yet -- but its namesake, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, knows a thing or two about a bad trip. She went to Colorado earlier this year and famously freaked out after eating too much marijuana-infused chocolate. ""I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me,"" she wrote of the experience. Or, as Dr. Gonzo might have explained, ""You took too much, man. You took too much, too much."" Related: NYT's Maureen Dowd inspires effort to educate Coloradans about edibles . Now, thanks to new rules coming on line early next year, marijuana newbies may have an easier time avoiding Dowd's fate. Starting in February, all recreational marijuana edibles have to come in single-serving sizes or sections. And some of Colorado's edible makers are already cranking out the personal-sized goodies. 10,000 personal-sized goodies, that is, for each pound of marijuana they produce. At Sweet Grass Kitchen here recently, executive chef Lauren Finesilver was making a seasonal favorite, pumpkin pie. The single-serving pies, like the chocolate chip cookies, brownies and Snickerdoodles, are made with butter infused with marijuana, or cannabutter. (Cannabis + butter. Get it?) Related: Pumpkin pot pie . For her batch of pie crusts, Finesilver used butter simmered in about a half pound of weed and then strained. Butter is the medium of choice because it tastes good and is easy to digest, explained owner Julie Berliner. And all her single-serving baked goods contain 10mg of THC, about equivalent of smoking a joint, Berliner said. But, it's a different kind of high. ""It's more of a body high, when you smoke it's more psychoactive,"" she explained. But eat too much and you could soon find yourself dowding. And that's where the smaller sizes come in handy. ""Breaking our products into single servings makes it intuitive for someone to eat one serving and know that if they are going to have more, they actually have to take another bite,"" she said. ""They don't have to try to do the math and cut a cookie or a truffle up into several pieces."" And that should help keep nubes like Maureen Dowd from going to pieces.","New rules will make producers sell marijuana edibles in single-serving sizes in Colorado .

"When the two bombs went off at the Boston Marathon, I was reminded right away of another April day torn apart by violence. April 19, 1995, began as a calm, clear day in my hometown of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I was a young college student at the time, aspiring to be a journalist. I was driving to work  when I heard the news. Just then six Oklahoma State Toopers cars screamed past me, racing towards downtown. I went numb. This was my home. Things like this didn't happen here. In the days after the bombing, I contacted my family and friends to make sure they were safe. I also sought out survivors like Jennifer Robinson, who was living in the Regency Tower, which was a few short blocks away from the target of the bombing, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. She was just getting up for the day when the blast rocked the entire area, shattering windows and spreading debris. ""It scared me to death. I have no idea if everyone got out of my apartment building,"" she told me. The blast left her homeless and without a car. I spoke with Robinson again a day after the attack in Boston, and she said the marathon bombing brought back memories of the Oklahoma bombing. Other fellow Oklahomans that I knew felt the same way, including journalist Clytie Bunyan, who was in the post office across the street from the Murrah building when the bomb detonated. ""It's safe to say that [the] explosions in Boston don't sit well with people here,"" Bunyan said. ""People here have moved on with their lives, but naturally we remember our pain when things like this happen. And April is still a difficult month for some."" We felt a deep sense of loss and grief and came together in solidarity and support. People stepped forward and offered to help. Like Maj. Chris Fields of the Oklahoma City Fire Department, who had been on the scene for just 20 minutes when police officer John Avery found 1-year-old Baylee Almon in the rubble and handed her to Fields. Almon was one of the 19 children who were lost that day and the images of her little body carefully cradled in Fields' arms became an enduring symbol for many. Eighteen years later, Fields watched some of the coverage from Boston at his fire station in Oklahoma City and says the images struck a familiar cord. ""9/11 was a different scale, but this being right in a downtown area and you know, this hit a lot closer to home than 9/11 did,"" Fields said. When he saw interviews with the first responders in Boston, he noticed that they answered questions the way he did that day. ""The images they saw were what I saw,"" he said. Oklahomans have never been the kind to dwell on the past, but we won't forget the 168 people who died in the blast on April 19 and those who bravely survived. That day does not define us, even if it has become a part of our story. Through the years, we have moved on. We are not victims. We are survivors, and we have thrived. Fields reflects that healing in the wake of a terror attack like Oklahoma City or Boston takes a lot of time. ""It took a while,"" he said. ""I've done some counseling. It will never be just another day, but now I don't dread it like I used to. It's not something you forget, and it's going to be with them for a long time. If you think you might need help, talk to somebody about that. That was something I did wrong. My heart goes out to them."" He adds that the definition of ""normal"" changed for Oklahomans after the attack. Maybe Bostonians would feel the same way. But despite what we've gone through, we are resilient, strong, and we won't let the actions of the perpetrators get to us.","Marcy Heinz: Boston Marathon bombing brought back memories of an April day in 1995 .

"(CNN)Millions of people have now seen the video. Eric Garner, standing on a sidewalk, asks the NYPD officers surrounding him, ""What did I do? What did I do?"" Garner, 43, raises both hands in the air and tells the officers not to touch him. Moments later, he's on the ground while a plain-clothes officer places him in an apparent choke hold. Garner gasps, ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe."" His words are muffled as his face is pressed into the pavement. By the end of the video, Garner is lifeless on the Staten Island sidewalk. The video went viral. Garner's death sparked protests across the country, thrusting into the spotlight the issue of police brutality on unarmed citizens. Citizens who, in increasing numbers, have taken to arming themselves with their own kind of weapon -- their cell phones. ""The police out here [are] crazy.  Nobody trusts them. So I decided to pull out my camera every time they come over here,"" said Ramsey Orta, who filmed the July 17 incident on his cell phone. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that acts of police force have not increased dramatically in recent years. Their Police Public Contact Survey found that in 2008, only 1.4% of those who reported contact with police had force used or threatened against them, with no statistically significant increase since 2002. What has changed is the prevalence of cell phones equipped with cameras. Cell phone videos of alleged police misconduct have proliferated online, flooding social media websites and provoking questions about law enforcement behavior. Luis Paulino's August 2012 beating by NYPD officers was captured on video and posted online. The video shows officers throwing Paulino to the ground. Several officers punch him repeatedly. According to Paulino, the officers started in on him after he saw them violently beating another young black man on the sidewalk. In the background, an unidentified male can be heard encouraging people to record what was happening and yelling, ""He didn't do nothing!"" For Paulino, the video proved to be vindicating. He was initially charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and obstructing a government official, but all charges were dropped. Without the video, ""there wouldn't have been anything but my word against 15 police officers,"" Paulino told journalist Soledad O'Brien. Paulino has filed a lawsuit against the city. The NYPD will not comment on the case, citing the legal proceedings. ""When you are in public spaces, where you have a right to be, you can photograph anything that is in plain view,"" said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union. Stanley's research focuses on technology-related privacy and civil liberties issues. The ACLU says that photographing things that are plainly visible from public spaces is a ""constitutional right"" and that this includes ""federal buildings, transportation facilities, and police and other government officials carrying out their duties."" Law enforcement officials also do not have the right to confiscate any video or photographs being taken, nor can they ask to view it without a warrant. ""If you are not interfering in any real way with legitimate police operations, they don't have the right to interfere in any way,"" Stanley said. Still, even with the perceived ubiquity of cell phone videos showing alleged acts of police misconduct, it seems that some errant officers aren't deterred by the cameras. Stanley said he believes authorities are simply still adjusting to the availability of new technology and the knowledge that they may be recorded at any time. ""For police officers, it can take a while to sink in [that they may be filmed].  As police officers do take in that new reality, we may see a revolution in terms of a drastic reduction in brutality.  We may not, but it's too early to tell,"" he said. Paul Callan, a CNN contributor and former prosecutor, said he believes that drastic reduction has already begun. ""I believe that the existence of cell phone video and social media postings has substantially reduced police brutality over the long run.  Although the intensity of news coverage of cases such as [George] Zimmerman and Michael Brown makes it feel like there is more police brutality, my sense of the situation as a lawyer who is in court several times a week is that the number of cases is diminishing,"" Callan said. Some police departments are embracing camera technology and are even utilizing it to strengthen transparency and accountability between their officers and the community.  Police departments in Rialto, California, and Mesa, Arizona, have implemented body-camera programs for their officers. The initiative seems to be working.  A 2014 study by the U.S. Department of Justice cites both departments, noting an 88% reduction in citizen complaints and a 60% reduction in officer use-of-force incidents after one year of camera deployment in Rialto. In Mesa, there were 40% fewer complaints for officers with cameras and 75% fewer use-of-force complaints overall. On September 4, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton announced that the police department would be testing two types of body cameras that would allow officers to record audio and video during their patrols. ""The NYPD is committed to embracing new and emerging technology in order to continue to keep New York City safe,"" Bratton said. ""Having patrol officers wear body cameras during this pilot demonstrates our commitment to transparency while it will also allow us to review its effectiveness with the intention of expanding the program."" The statement came less than a week after it was announced that officers in Ferguson, Missouri, had adopted the use of body cameras after the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teen who was fatally shot by an officer. In New York, cameras will be distributed to officers patrolling in precincts that reported the highest number of ""Stop, Question, and Frisk"" encounters in 2012. The policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they consider suspicious in an effort to deter crime -- has been widely criticized for unfairly targeting young, male minorities. Police-community relations in such precincts, with predominantly black and Latino residents, have been tenuous. Police department figures showed that nearly nine out of 10 people ""stopped and frisked"" in 2011 were African-American or Hispanic,  though New York  Mayor Bill de Blasio has said 90% of those stopped were innocent. In mid-November, the NYPD said the body-camera program is still in the planning stages. In the four months since Garner's death, the New York Medical Examiner's Officer ruled it a homicide.  Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, the NYPD said. In a statement, Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch called Pantaleo's reassignment ""a completely unwarranted, knee-jerk reaction for political reasons."" He said the move ""effectively pre-judges this case and denies the officer the very benefit of a doubt that has long been part of the social contract that allows police officers to face the risks of this difficult and complex job."" CNN's attempts to reach Pantaleo for comment were unsuccessful. A second police officer was placed on desk duty.  The NYPD also announced new mandatory training for officers on the proper use of force when engaging a suspect. Garner, a grandfather with six children, had a lengthy criminal history, including more than 30 arrests, and had previously been arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes in May. Police said they initially approached him on July 17 because they believed he was selling cigarettes illegally again. The case is now in the hands of Manhattan's district attorney. Citing the legal proceedings, Bratton declined to comment further on the case. In early October, Bratton spoke to a conference of NYPD officers, publicly stating that there were ""a few"" officers in the department who ""just don't get it."" ""They're not the right fit for the NYPD in 2014.  My intention going forward is to ensure that we will aggressively seek to get those out of the department who should not be here.  The brutal, the corrupt, the racist, the incompetent,"" Bratton said. Bratton told Soledad O'Brien that policing is ""a balancing act."" ""How do you have the appropriate level of policing to reduce crime, and prevent it, to reduce disorder and prevent it, but do it in a way that the law-abiding in that community don't feel they need to be fearful of the police?"" It's a balance that Paulino wonders if the NYPD will ever achieve. It has been two years since the incident, but Paulino, a former college football player, still goes to physical therapy every week to rehabilitate his injured shoulders. ""Every time I'm asked about the incident, I close my eyes and I can see myself there again.  I can see myself on the floor getting punched, getting kneed and asking why?"" Paulino said. ""Every day I wake up and I've got aches and pains in both my arms.  I'll never be the same.""","Death of Eric Garner, 43, was captured on cell phone video .

"Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN)The world's fourth-most populated country, Indonesia has about 250 million people. Any of them might have boarded AirAsia Flight QZ8501, never to come home. Seven crew members and 155 passengers were aboard -- almost one-third from the same Christian denomination. There was no single reason that members of Mawar Sharon, a Protestant faith with about 45,000 members around Indonesia, got on the AirAsia Airbus plane Sunday, beyond a common desire to get to Singapore in time for New Year's Eve. They weren't heading to one event. They didn't all necessarily know one another, having attended services at different churches mostly around Surabaya, the Indonesian city where the commercial airliner took off. Still, their religion tied them together. And pastor Lianggone Tejo Bunarto says he hopes that those shared beliefs help their loved ones cope now, as the search for more crash victims continues in the Java Sea. As Bunarto says, ""We're putting trust in God's hands."" Pastor: 'Put our trust' in God's will . About 50 people with relatives on QZ8501 spent part of Friday afternoon inside a special church for police officers in Surabaya. It wasn't a Mawar Sharon church; it was chosen because it's near the hospital where recovered bodies are being identified. But it served the same purpose: to allow the grieving to congregate, to reflect and to voice their beliefs. So they did, holding their hands high at times, holding each other's hands in prayers at others. They sang, the anguish in their faces starkly evident. Afterward, church members preferred not to talk to reporters. But Bunarto, who is a pastor to some of those on Flight QZ8501, did. He acknowledges the struggles these Mawar Sharon members, not to mention scores of other families, are facing. They may not understand why the plane went down. They may have trouble waiting for definitive word that their loved ones have been recovered, if that ever happens. And, despite their fervent faith, they might not grasp God's role in all of it. Bunarto says, ""Some things that happen in our lives, sometimes we just don't understand what God really intends."" That doesn't mean they lose faith. According to the pastor, ""We just put our trust -- everything, completely -- in his will. Because he's going to bring everything (that is) the best in our life."" CNN's Gary Tuchman reported from Surabaya, as did CNN's Dominique Van Heerden. Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","Pastor: 46 members of the Mawar Sharon denomination were on AirAsia Flight QZ8501 .

"In Syria's cyberwar, the regime's supporters have deployed a new weapon against opposition activists -- computer viruses that spy on them, according to an IT specialist from a Syrian opposition group and a former international aid worker whose computer was infected. A U.S.-based antivirus software maker, which analyzed one of the viruses at CNN's request, said that it was recently written for a specific cyberespionage campaign and that it passes information it robs from computers to a server at a government-owned telecommunications company in Syria. Supporters of dictator Bashar al-Assad first steal the identities of opposition activists, then impersonate them in online chats, said software engineer Dlshad Othman. They gain the trust of other users, pass out Trojan horse viruses and encourage people to open them. Once on the victim's computer, the malware sends information out to third parties. Inside Syria: Hope, supplies run low in bunker . Othman is an IT security ""go-to-guy"" for opposition activists. He resides outside of Syria for his own safety. Since December, he has heard from dozens of opposition members who say their computers were infected. Two of them recently passed actual viruses to Othman and a colleague with whom he works. They checked them out. ""We have two malwares -- first one is really complex,"" Othman said via Skype chat. ""It can hide itself more."" The U.S. analysis of one of the viruses -- the simpler one -- would appear to corroborate the time of its launch around the start of the year. The virus has two parts, said Vikram Thakur, principal security response manager at Symantec Corporation, known to consumers for its Norton antivirus software. He said one of them points to December 6 and the other to January 16. Thakur has dubbed the simpler virus ""backdoor.breut."" It was the more complex virus that the former aid worker unwittingly downloaded during a chat. Since she travels to Syria, she has requested that CNN not name her for security reasons and instead refer to her as ""Susan."" In one Syrian town, full-throated cries of defiance . To get a picture of the humanitarian needs on the ground in Syria, ""Susan"" contacted opposition members via the Internet. In January, she received a call via Skype from someone she believed was a regime opponent. It was an imposter and a regime supporter, she claims. ""They called me actually and pretended that it's him -- this activist that I didn't know, because I'd been talking to him only two times and only in writing."" Days later, other opposition members told Susan and Othman that the activist she thought she had spoken with was in detention. Activists accuse government forces of coercing him to reveal his user name and identity and of then going online to impersonate him. Othman says additional activists, who say they were detained and released, tell of being forced to turn over their passwords to Syrian authorities. CNN cannot independently confirm the accusations, because the Syrian government strictly limits international media coverage within its borders. Calls for Syrian government comment to a spokeswoman for al-Assad on Friday were not answered or did not go through. Friday is the weekly special day of prayer in the Muslim world. The man chatting with Susan via Skype passed her a file. She recalled what he said to her to coax her to open it: ""This makes sure that when you're talking to me, it's really me talking to you and not somebody else."" New York Times reporter dies in Syria . She clicked on the file. ""It actually didn't do anything,"" she said in a baffled tone. ""I didn't notice any change at all."" No graphics launched; no pop-up opened to announce to the user that the virus was being downloaded. The link appeared to be dead or defected, said Othman. The second virus, backdoor.breut, which was e-mailed to him by an activist inside Syria for analysis, launched the same way. ""Download, open, then nothing,"" Othman said. It contains a fake Facebook logo and was passed off in a chat room as a Facebook security update, he said. At CNN's request, Othman forwarded that virus to an IT security expert in California for an independent analysis. Othman removed the more complex malware on Susan's computer but made an image of the infected hard drive beforehand. At more than 250 GB, it would have to be sent on an external hard drive by regular post -- snail mail -- for any independent scrutiny. The U.S. expert confirmed the invisible nature of the backdoor.breut Trojan horse download. Thousand stage public protests on Friday . ""Nothing would actually show up,"" said Thakur. ""The only thing that the Trojan actually does -- it copies itself into one of the temporary locations, but that would not be visible to the regular user."" The malware launches when the user reboots the computer. The Syrian cyberactivist and the California IT security manager pointed out that the lack of fanfare during download helps to conceal the viruses from their victims. ""Most of them will say 'it's a damaged file,' and they will forget about it,"" Othman said. Susan did just that. She was not aware she had been hacked until she lost her Facebook and e-mail accounts a few days after clicking on the file. ""I didn't click on any kind of new link or something, so they must have known about the password,"" she said, referring to the loss of her Facebook account. She handed over her laptop to Othman and his colleague, who told her that the Trojan horse had logged her key strokes, taken screen shots, rummaged through her folders. It hid the IP address it sent its information to, Othman said. Othman found a screen shot the Trojan horse took of Susan's online banking home page.  He told her to change all her passwords, Susan said. ""You don't want your money to be stolen by some of the Syrian security guys,"" she quipped. The other virus -- backdoor.breut -- sends the information it pillages from infected computers to the IP address: 216.6.0.28 and does not hide this. ""We checked the IP address that our engineer referenced and can confirm that it belongs to the STE (Syrian Telecommunications Establishment),"" a Symantec representative wrote to CNN. The STE is the government telecommunications company. This does not necessarily mean that someone at STE is doing the hacking, Thakur stresses. ""Whether it's a home user behind that or it's actually a company or an organization, which has been allocated that IP address, we just have no insight from where we sit."" But the Syrian government has access to all activity through that server ""absolutely without any doubt,"" Thakur said. Anyone not wanting the government to see what they are up to would not use that server. Skilled Syrian opposition activists avoid government telecom servers when online. The simple virus, backdoor.breut, acts like a bull in a china shop, Symantec's Thakur said. ""It did not look like it was written by any sophisticated hacker,"" he said after examining it. ""It was just kind of put together -- slapstick functionality."" Simple malware is readily available for download on underground forums in the Internet. Hackers can repurpose it and hand it out.  Othman believed the second software to be such an off-the-shelf product because of its amateurish construction, but the California expert disagrees. ""It's not something that somebody just went out there, copied code from an Internet website and just pasted it in. It was definitely coded for its current purpose."" The name ""backdoor.breut"" derives from the virus' behavior. ""We sort of took the word 'brute' just because of what it was actually doing and kind of changed a couple of characters to b-r-e-u-t,"" Thakur said. ""Brute -- meaning that it is using brute force -- it's just going in smash-and-grab -- I'm going to try to get anything that I can and get the hell out of there."" Backdoor.breut attempts to give the hacker remote control of the victim's computer, according to the analysis. It steals passwords and system information, downloads new programs, guides internal processes, logs keystrokes and takes shots with the webcam. It also turns off antivirus notification, but that does not completely conceal it from detection. ""Some of the good software can detect it in the same day,"" Thakur said. The nature of its use may make backdoor.breut and other new Syrian malware hard to defend against. Antivirus makers need to know the virus to be able to assign it a signature and make the file detectible to block the download, according to Thakur. The more widely a new virus spreads around the world, the more likely it is to land on an antivirus maker's radar. The smaller the region the virus is located in, the less likely virus vigilantes are to notice and combat it. ""Looking at this Trojan and the telemetry that we've gathered the last five or six days since we did the analysis, this is not targeting people across the complete globe. So, it could be days before some antiviruses actually create signatures for the file,"" Thakur said. More complex antivirus software can detect malware that does not yet have a signature, because of how it behaves after infecting the computer, Thakur said. If the antivirus does not have this 'behavior' component, it may not defend against a new virus ""for a substantial amount of time."" On a Facebook page named ""Cyber Arabs,"" Othman warns activists of the danger of downloading the virus and reminds users to keep their antivirus software updated. Download.com, CNET's software download website, offers antivirus software, some of which includes a ""behavior"" component and is free of charge. But that is still no guarantee for not contracting a new Syrian cyberbug, ""Susan"" reminds. ""It was up-to-date,"" she said. ""The problem is that they sent me a ... file, and I was totally stupid -- like, it's an EXE file -- and I opened it.""","U.S. antivirus experts say a virus is sending information to a server in Syria .

"(CNN)One year ago this month, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau released a video announcing a new, reprehensible front in its bloody attempt at forced Islamism: his fighters will begin abducting girls and selling them. The kidnappings, he said, were retaliation for Nigerian security forces nabbing the wives and children of group members. And for 12 months, the radical militant group has done just that -- with Nigerians treating the sporadic kidnappings with disgust but resignation. But that's changed now. ""When this first happened ... what I was hearing from my friends and from other people was like, 'Why do I care?  Nigeria is done. Nigeria is going to disintegrate,'"" said Emeka Daniel, whose father was kidnapped in Nigeria in an unrelated incident. ""I refused to believe that,"" he said. ""We can't let this be the new normal."" Here are six reasons why the Boko Haram abductions, the repugnant message its leader released this week, and Nigeria's inadequate response should matter to the rest of the world. Terrorism isn't isolated . Just imagine if 276 girls had been kidnapped in the United States. The response would be mass outrage and a forceful demand for a response. As borders become more irrelevant for terrorists, the whole world needs to take notice of the likes of Boko Haram. ""We need to take ownership as if this happened in Chicago or this happened in Washington, D.C.,"" said Nicole Lee, outgoing president of the TransAfrica Forum.  ""We need to be talking about this. ... We need to make sure our own government is helping in any way that we can."" What the Boko Haram has set out to do in Africa's most populous nation is as heinous as the havoc the Taliban is wreaking. ""They actually originated as a group called the Nigerian Taliban, which kind of explains where they're coming from,"" said CNN's national security analyst Peter Bergen. ""They are aiming to impose Taliban-style rule on much of Nigeria, particularly in the north where they are based."" The group's name itself means ""Western education is sinful"" in the local Hausa language. Its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law. The group especially opposes the education of women. Under its version of Sharia law, women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands, not at school learning to read and write. Then consider its ties to al Qaeda. How closely related Boko Haram is to al Qaeda is hard to define, but the United States says it has links. ""Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which is the North African al Qaeda affiliate, has given money to Boko Haram in the past,"" Bergen said. ""There is reporting suggesting that Osama bin Laden was in communication with the leadership of this group."" Daniel put it succinctly. ""People are thinking, this doesn't affect my country, but I'm telling them terrorists ... didn't just wake up one morning and decide to become terrorists,"" he said. ""These guys, it takes years for them to decide to go out there and commit these atrocities.  So as the world, we have to come together and try to find a solution to this problem."" The United States is so concerned about anti-Western terrorism in Nigeria that the State Department released a warning last week to Americans traveling within and to Nigeria that ""groups associated with terrorism"" may be planning an attack in Lagos, the country's commercial center, Bergen said. The inhumane treatment of children concerns us all . The terrorists raided the girls' school in the middle of the night, posing as soldiers. After a gunfight with security guards, they stormed the students' dormitory and herded the girls into vehicles. As they made their escape, the militants burned down nearby buildings in the northern town of Chibok. The girls disappeared into the night. Even worse are fears of what will happen to the girls next. The new video from the purported leader of Boko Haram detailed this chilling plan: . ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah,"" said a man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau in the video first obtained by Agence France-Presse. If the claim proves true, the 276 teen girls could become child brides or sex slaves. Rights groups have said Boko Haram has kidnapped girls as young as 12. And the abductions are only getting worse. In the first two months of this year alone, Boko Haram kidnapped at least 25 girls and women, according to Human Rights Watch. In November, the militant group abducted dozens of Christian girls and women, most of whom were later rescued by the military deep in a forest in Maiduguri. At the time of their rescue, some were pregnant or had children, and others had been forcibly converted to Islam and married off to their kidnappers. The parents' hands are tied . Any parent can only imagine the horror of a child getting kidnapped. Now multiply that by 276 and add the fear of a volatile terrorist group. Families of some of the kidnapped girls are petrified of speaking to the media for fear of retribution against their daughters. ""Many of the parents feel if there is even (any) kind of movement from their end, they could see the children killed,"" CNN's Nigeria-based correspondent Vladimir Duthiers said. ""The parents told us, over the course of the last three weeks, they themselves have risked their own lives trying to go in armed with machetes, sticks and rocks to do the job they say the Nigerian military is unwilling to do."" It's the price they pay for daring to send their girls to school despite threats from Boko Haram. The kidnapped girls were from Borno state, where 72% of primary-age children have never attended school, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria. Daniel said he knows what the parents are going through. His father was abducted in Nigeria four years ago while returning home from work. ""You can't sleep. You can't eat."" To this day, Daniel said, he can still hear the cries of his family members. ""So I really feel for these mothers that lost their daughters. It's -- I can't -- you can't really begin to understand what they are going through until you're in that situation."" Daniel's father was shot and almost died. He was released only after the family paid a ransom. What happens in Nigeria has deeper repercussions . Nigeria boasts Africa's largest economy. But internal problems can have a ripple effect far and wide. Nigerian militant activity has already spilled over to neighbors such as Cameroon, whose government has warned that clerics have been recruiting members in mosques in the country, said Orji Uzor Kalu, a former governor of Nigeria's Abia State. ""In this era of accelerating globalization, it appears Boko Haram hopes to align itself with extremist forces in Niger, Mali and potentially in the Middle East, which raises the specter of coordination on the stockpiling of munitions, intelligence gathering and future assaults,"" Kalu said. The Nigerian response has been feeble . Two days after the kidnappings, the Nigerian military said all but eight of the girls were free. That turned out to be untrue, prompting the father of one of the abducted girls to say the government had gone from using ""blatant propaganda"" to telling ""blatant lie."" For three weeks, President Goodluck Jonathan said nothing. He has yet to visit the region. And when he did begin speaking about the abductions, he criticized the parents for not cooperating with the police, for not sharing information. ""It's been awful, frankly,"" said Richard Downie of the Nigerian government's response. Downie is the deputy director and fellow for the African program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""These girls were taken in the middle of last month and really it was not until last night that we had the first lengthy comments from the president, which lends credence to this allegation that the government is not sufficiently invested in this crisis,"" Downie said Monday. Add to that the comments Jonathan's wife reportedly made. ""Patience Jonathan, who is the first lady, called some of the mothers to her, to meet with her, and she basically told them that they really need to be quiet and they were really bringing shame and embarrassment to Nigeria,"" said Lee, from the TransAfrica Forum. ""That's certainly a problem."" This can't be business as usual . With a World Economic Forum set to begin Wednesday in the capital city of Abuja, the Nigerian government is under mounting pressure to find and save the girls. The U.S. government is offering to help, but said Nigeria must take the lead in finding the students. Officials told CNN the Obama administration is sharing intelligence with Nigerian authorities and could provide other assistance, but there is no plan to send U.S. troops. A group of U.S. senators from both parties has introduced a resolution calling for the United States to help the Nigerian government improve school security and go after Boko Haram. The resolution stops short of calling for sending American troops. Instead, it urges ""timely civilian assistance"" from the United States and allied African nations to help rescue the abducted students. Rights groups are therefore heartened at the groundswell of support, with the globally trending hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. Crowds from Los Angeles to London rallied over the weekend. ""I think one of the most beautiful things that has happened is people are taking the hashtag, putting them in front of them and saying, 'Bring back our girls,'"" Lee said. ""I think people are doing that. It's catching fire."" CNN's Erin Burnett, Janelle Griffin, Martin Savidge, Barbara Starr,  Faith Karimi, Tom Cohen, Bill Weir and Aminu Abubakar contributed to this report.","The girls were kidnapped from school more than 3 weeks ago .

"It is estimated that around one in four couples around the world have trouble conceiving. For a small proportion of them, In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is a technology that can restore the dream of parenthood. IVF is the fertilization of an egg by sperm outside the body, where it is cultivated in a lab environment, and if an embryo results it is implanted into the mother's womb. Now the chances of IVF treatment being successful are being boosted by a machine called the Embryoscope. A record number of babies are being born through IVF -- with over 60,000 IVF babies born in the United States alone in 2012. But since the inception of IVF in the 1970s, monitoring embryos has been a difficulty. In order to examine them, the embryologist must remove them from the safe environment of the incubator and expose them to environmental hazards such as temperature changes and contaminants. Embryos are removed and examined just once a day, which limits the information available to embryologists, as well as the chances of picking the embryo with the best chance of delivering a viable pregnancy. Embryo development . But these longstanding issues are being addressed by the Embryoscope. The device combines an incubator that maintains perfect conditions, with a tiny camera that takes photos every 10-15 minutes -- creating a time-lapse video of the embryo's development. This removes the need to expose the embryo to the outside atmosphere, and provides embryologists with far greater information with which to make decisions. ""I think this is the most exciting breakthrough since IVF started,"" says Dr. Simon Fishel, managing director of the UK's CARE Fertility, responsible for the first Embryoscope baby born in the UK, in 2012 (as well as the first ever IVF baby back in 1978). ""The information that we are gathering with the Embryoscope with the time-lapse is far superior,"" he says. ""We have much, much more information on which to base the crucial decision as to which embryo is the one to transfer back to the patient."" Embryos that show early abnormalities can be immediately ruled out, and learning algorithms have been created that recognize positive or negative patterns at key development points thereafter -- meaning patients can be implanted with embryos that have an optimal chance of success. ""We have a predictive scale (for evaluating) the likelihood of an embryo to give the best chance of a live birth,"" says Fishel. ""It's a complex procedure and it uses very complex technology and some mathematics. But using this whole process, it really changes the way the embryologists work in the lab. And I think it's changing the face of how we do IVF, in fact."" Improving the odds . The extra information is particularly beneficial for patients with the lowest chances of pregnancy -- such as older women, or those with reduced egg counts. CARE estimates its use of the Embryoscope and algorithms broadly increases the chance of a pregnancy by around 20%. ""The images also allow you a higher level of assurance to pick an embryo with the highest chance of being genetically normal,"" says Dr. Jason Barritt, lab director at the ART Reproductive Center, in California. The technology can also provide insights into early-stage development beyond the need to conceive. A recent Spanish study conducted with an Embryoscope showed differences in growth patterns between male and female embryos, which could potentially allow gender to be more rapidly determined. Use of the Embryoscope has spread to IVF facilities around the world, but some barriers remain: the vast amount of extra data requires greater resources for analysis, and the technology itself is expensive. But much of IVF is about trying to beat the odds, and as technology progresses, so do the chances of parenthood for couples who can't conceive naturally.","Embryoscope gives time-lapse images of IVF embryos .

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Saturday urged Egypt's first democratically elected leader to ""assert the full authority of the presidency."" After her meeting with President Mohamed Morsy -- the first such visit by a U.S. Cabinet official --- Clinton stressed that it was up to Egypt's people to shape the country's political future. But she also noted that the United States would work ""to support the military's return to a purely national security role."" ""The United States supports the full transition to civilian rule, with all that it entails,"" she said. Clinton's visit came as Egypt is in the throes of domestic political chaos, with Morsy in a tug of war with the military leadership in Cairo. The Islamist president doesn't have his own Cabinet in place, and there is no parliament. ""This is a time marked by historic firsts, but also great uncertainty. Egyptians are in the midst of complex negotiations about almost every facet of the transition,"" Clinton said. As photographers snapped pictures of their meeting, Morsy told Clinton, ""We are very, very keen to meet you and happy that you are here."" The tone of the meeting was cordial and constructive, with much back and forth, according to a senior State Department official who described the talks on condition of anonymity. Clinton laid out U.S. ideas for supporting Egypt's fragile economy and the two discussed regional security issues, the official said. Clinton commended Morsy's public commitment to national unity and pluralism. Clinton made it clear the United States will stand up for universal human rights, the official said. For his part, Morsy underscored the expectations of Egyptians for a complete democratic transition and stressed his commitment to dialogue with all stakeholders, according to the official. Earlier this week, Clinton sent a message to Egypt's leaders to talk to one another and settle their differences for the good of the people, saying both the president and the military needed to work together to avoid derailing Egypt's democratic transition. Clinton met Saturday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Kamel Amr and told reporters President Barack Obama wants to relieve up to $1 billion in Egyptian debt and help foster innovation, growth and job creation. The United States is ready to make available $250 million in loan guarantees to Egyptian businesses, Clinton said. On Sunday, Clinton is scheduled to meet with Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of Egypt's military council. Tantawi, a 76-year-old career infantry officer, fought in Egypt's 1956, 1967 and 1973 wars with Israel. Egypt's military is the foundation of the modern state, having overthrown the country's monarchy in 1952. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which assumed legislative powers after it dissolved parliament, continues to wield that power even after Morsy's swearing-in. It will retain those powers until a new parliament is sworn in near the end of the year. In the presidential election, Morsy edged out Ahmed Shafik -- the last prime minister to serve under former President Hosni Mubarak -- winning nearly 52% of the votes cast. He resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party shortly after the results were announced in an apparent effort to send a message that he will represent all Egyptians. But the country's political uncertainty has continued since he took office June 30. Clinton aides said the secretary of state wanted to visit Cairo early after Morsy's swearing-in to show that the Obama administration wants to help the new government improve Egypt's economy. During her visit, the secretary was expected to discuss equality for the country's Coptic Christians, who have faced persecution in the past. She was scheduled to meet with Christian leaders from across Egypt on Sunday to discuss their concerns. Is Clinton visit the push Cairo needs? The peace treaty with Israel and the situation in the Sinai on the border between the two countries will also be high on the agenda. Both the United States and Israel have been concerned about recent cross-border attacks into Israel that have heightened tensions between both countries. The area has seen an explosive mix of trafficking of weapons and people across the border from Sudan, coupled with a variety of terrorist groups moving increasingly freely in the area. Does the U.S. matter any more in Egypt and Israel? On the same day of Clinton's visit,  Egyptian state media reported that security services in North Sinai were intensifying efforts to get a kidnapped American couple and their tour guide released. Bedouin kidnappers want authorities to release a relative who is in detention in Alexandria on drug charges, said Gen. Ahmed Bakr, head of security in the North Sinai. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased since a popular uprising ousted Mubarak last year. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo said it was ""in close touch with Egyptian authorities, who are doing everything they can to bring about safe release of the American tourists."" Clinton's meeting with Morsy kicks off what is expected to be a steady stream of high-level U.S. officials to visit Cairo in coming months, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta within the next few weeks and culminating with a possible meeting with President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the U.N.

"Washington (CNN)The Obama administration's top aide in charge of promoting Obamacare enrollment is leaving the White House, possibly with eyes on helping another Democrat win the job in 2016. Marlon Marshall, an aide to Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, is leaving the White House to rejoin 270 Strategies, a Democratic consulting firm he helped found. ""I am thrilled today to announce I will be returning to the management team of 270 Strategies,"" Marshall, who served as deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, said in a statement. ""I want to thank the President for the opportunity to serve and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett for being an amazing boss and mentor."" Word of Marshall's departure from the White House had been rumored for months, both inside and outside 270 Strategies. Buzzfeed reported in December that he was thought to rejoin the consulting firm and the Washington Post broke the story Friday morning. The now former White House aide is close with Roby Mook, an operative who many Democrats see as the frontrunner for Clinton's 2016 campaign manager job. Mook and Marshall worked together on Clinton and Obama's 2008 campaigns and share a small group of confidants and friends. If Mook is tapped for the top campaign job, Marshall is expected to get a top position, too. The Mook-Marshall oddly played out last year when emails for a group of people - the self-proclaimed ""Mook Mafia"" -- were leaked to ABC. In them, Marshall -- who refers to himself as ""Reverend"" - congratulated friends working on campaigns for ""crushing it mafia style."" ""F U Republicans. Mafia till I die,"" Marshall wrote in one email obtained by ABC. ""If you have just a few minutes, hop on that activate and punish those voters!"" Marshall said he was returning to 270 Strategies because of the group's commitment to ""doing big things and having a meaningful impact on the issues and communities we care about."" ""It was our deep-seated belief that grassroots organizing is a necessary component to making change in those communities,"" Marshall said. ""Today, the 270 mission is stronger than ever, and I could not be more excited to rejoin the team.""","Marlon Marshall is leaving the White House and could be in line for a possible Clinton campaign job .

"Dramatic surveillance camera video shows a Skywest pilot running to a jet that, once set in motion, clips an airport building in last July's bizarre incident involving pilot Brian J. Hedglin, who stole the plane while being sought on suspicion that he had killed his former girlfriend. Hedglin, 40, set the empty regional jet in motion on the tarmac of the closed airport, and then killed himself with a gunshot to the head, officials concluded. But investigators were not able to answer several questions that have confounded people since the July 18 incident, including whether Hedglin intended to take off in the plane, and if so, what he intended to do with it. ""The answer to that is 'We'll never know,'"" said St. George, Utah, city spokesman Marc Mortensen. Police reports released in recent days, however, leave open the possibility that Hedglin intended to take off in the aircraft. But he may have been foiled when a safety clip on the landing gear was damaged, leaving him unable to steer the plane on the ground. The plane rolled a short distance, its wing clipping the terminal building, before crashing through a fence and ramming into a half-dozen cars. Evidence indicates that while the plane was in motion, Hedglin left the cockpit, entered the cabin and shot himself in the head. Authorities in St. George, Utah, released the surveillance video this week. Had Hedglin gotten the plane aloft at St. George Municipal Airport, the regional jet -- a CRJ 200 -- contained enough fuel to fly for about 50 minutes, according to the police report. A cockpit voice recorder did not provide much information to investigators, the police reports say. The recorder contains only the voices of pilots who flew a previous flight, and sounds of ""some rustling in the cockpit and heaving breathing that is assumed to be Brian Hedglin."" ""What his ultimate motive is is really unclear,"" Mortensen said. ""I'm not going to speculate, but obviously he was intending to take the plane off or he was trying to cause as much damage as possible."" Hedglin had been a pilot with the airline since 2005. Police who were among the first at the crash site described a bizarre and confusing scene. The plane was tilted forward, its nose gear collapsed. The engines were still screaming and several cars were wedged under and around the wings. The plane's doors were shut and there was no indication that anyone was on the aircraft. When a firefighter told police that someone was on the plane, officers entered with guns drawn and found Hedglin, wearing a green jump suit, lying in the aisle with a gun near his feet. Police soon learned the identity of the man, and found out that he was a suspect in his former girlfriend's murder and that he had military experience -- two factors that prompted them to send a bomb squad on a thorough search of the plane. No bomb was found. Hedglin's former girlfriend, Christina Cornejo, 39, had been found dead the previous Friday in Colorado Springs. Both Hedglin and Cornejo had served in the Colorado Army National Guard, officials said. Cornejo was found at Hedglin's residence, but authorities don't know whether she went there voluntarily or was abducted, Colorado Springs Police spokeswoman Barbara A. Miller told CNN at the time.  A coroner said Cornejo died of multiple stab wounds. Hedglin was immediately identified as a suspect. ""Detectives went so far as to contact SkyWest and have them deactivate Mr. Hedglin's access cards in the event he showed up there,"" police said. Hedglin's motorcycle was found outside the St. George airport, and authorities say they believe he used a rug to climb over the airport's barbed wire fence. The FBI declined any update on the investigation. ""Although the FBI responded to the incident in St. George this past summer, at this point we are not making any further comments on the matter,"" said spokeswoman Debbie Bertram.","Skywest pilot Brian J.

"Ibadan, Nigeria (CNN)Along the Niger Delta, an abundance of vivid purple flowers are blooming gently on the surface of the water, adding a touch of color to the inland waterways. But that's where the beauty ends because these striking flowers are water hyacinths -- an aquatic weed wreaking havoc in local communities and ruining water supplies. Not only does this fast-growing water pest curtail access to waterways and cause problems for local fishermen, it also depletes nutrients from the water, which in turn reduces fish populations. But where many see an invasive aquatic nuisance, Nigerian entrepreneur Achenyo Idachaba identified a business opportunity. Setting up shop in Ibadan, a city in the south-west region of Nigeria, she began harvesting the water hyacinth and transforming the waste product into intricately handcrafted everyday items. ""What we do is take an environmental problem and turn it into a win-win solution,"" Idachaba explains. The 46-year-old entrepreneur has always had a passion for sustainable development. Over the years she has consulted on various environmental projects relating to waste recovery. But turning these watery weeds into a tangible, bespoke craft was the first idea to really catch her entrepreneurial eye. Splitting her time between Nigeria and the United States -- where she was born -- she finally returned from the diaspora in 2009 and three years later founded MitiMeth. In 2013, the company was awarded a grant from the Federal Government of Nigeria allowing the small startup to grow and take seven full-time staff on board as well as provide work opportunities to local artisans during busy periods. Making each craft depends on the climate and having enough hands to work. The weeds are harvested from a myriad of local water channels and laid out in the sun to dry out, which can take anywhere from four days to two weeks in the rainy season. Once dry, they are then processed into the rope required to weave products together. In addition to creating beautiful woven handicrafts, Idachaba wanted to offer local communities skills and potential business ideas. Along with the MitiMeth team, she has branched out into eight communities, mainly in the Niger Delta, training and educating residents on how to take this watery menace and transform it into rope for weaving products. ""We help them to see the invasive weed through a different lens in terms of this could actually become a source of livelihood,"" she says. ""We go in and train them on how to harvest the material from the waterways, we tell them how they are supposed to dry it and then we teach them how to weave the water hyacinth. We also demonstrate the type of products that they could make. ""After we assist them with basic training, the rest is left up to their own creativity and we see them use the skills they have acquired to turn them into products that we've never even mentioned."" So far, Idachaba has been marketing her products online to a largely Nigerian customer base while also selling through third party retail outlets in Lagos. But the businesswoman wants to take her startup further in 2015. ""We want to see ourselves as the number one maker of eco-friendly handicrafts -- that are telling this very unique story about how we have transformed Nigeria's problem of water hyacinth into a beneficial solution."" She adds: ""And to build on that (to) become one of the major non-oil sector exporters of products from Nigeria.""","Achenyo Idachaba returned to Nigeria in 2009 hoping to start a business .

"From Gaza City to Tel Aviv, rockets kept flying, people kept dying and fear and anger on both sides kept growing. For all the bloodshed thus far -- including at least 30 killed in Gaza since Wednesday, according to a Palestinian government website, and Israel reporting three deaths in Kiryat Malachi -- there has been little indication the situation will calm any time soon. In fact, fears are rising that the opposite will hold true. Israel's Cabinet on Friday approved the activation of up to 75,000 reservists, prime minister's spokesman Mark Regev said. Also, the Israel Defense Forces reported earlier in the day that it is ""mobilizing forces"" in preparation for a ""possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip."" Q&A: Gaza strikes could be beginning of ground attack . The violence ""seems that it's beyond control,"" said Daniel Ben Simon, a Knesset member not aligned with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition. The violence continued Saturday morning, with several loud explosions from apparent Israeli strikes rattling Gaza City. The Cabinet headquarters for Hamas, the same building where Egypt's prime minister met with Hamas' officials the previous day, was among the sites destroyed, according to Hamas TV. From northern Gaza, Mohammed Sulaiman said he could hear bombs intermittently falling from Israeli warplanes as well as, from the other side, rockets periodically whistling toward Israel. ""The situation is totally dangerous here, and it is not safe to be out in the street,"" Sulaiman said. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces, which has accused Hamas of turning Gaza into ""a frontal base for Iran,"" said 97 rockets launched from Gaza had hit Israel since midweek, while another 99 were intercepted by a missile defense system. The former category included rockets that landed near Israel's two most populous cities Friday. No damage was reported, but Israelis consider the attacks on its major population centers to be an escalation, said Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren. Two struck an open area south of Jerusalem, with Hamas militants confirming they had fired rockets toward that city. iReporter captures wailing sirens warning of rockets in Jerusalem . Alarms went off, too, in Tel Aviv, prompting people to scurry off beaches and into safe locales, witnesses said. From a seaside restaurant, Elian Karen said the rocket went into the ocean about 10 to 15 meters deep, caused water to rise briefly before black smoke began rising from the water. Within 10 minutes, people were back on the beach -- sitting, eating, playing and seemingly determined not to let the conflict disrupt their lives. Photos: Deadly attacks in Gaza, Israel . ""Everyone is on the beach right now, very normal (and) no stress,"" Karen said Friday. ""We want to have a normal life and enjoy life."" Rejecting the idea of a temporary cease-fire Israel had requested because of the Egyptian prime minister's Gaza visit,  the militant group al-Qassam -- the military arm of Hamas -- reported on its Twitter feed that it had fired a Grad missile  Friday on the southern Israeli city of Beer Sheva. Israeli: 'How would you feel if your children were constantly scared?' In Ashkelon, about 17 kilometers (10 miles) north of Gaza, local officials said rocket strikes had increased dramatically in recent days. Such attacks are nothing new for residents accustomed to hunkering down in bunker rooms, but the emptiness of the town's marina and streets suggested the uptick had left people on edge. ""It is really frightening,"" Shiraz Wieselhof said. ""I cannot sleep at night."" This violent back-and-forth comes after the Israeli military's start Wednesday of an operation it calls Pillar of Defense, which it launched to target those behind the high number of rockets fired at Israel over the past year. Israel: 'All options on the table in Gaza' Israeli authorities said the military campaign has hit more than 600 targets for what it calls terror activity and stifled rocket launches out of Gaza, a claim denied by al-Qassam. Photos from Friday showed fiery rubble of where Hamas' Interior Ministry building once stood. Hamas field commander Ahmad Abu Galala was killed Friday, according to Hamas officials, and Israel's military reported that fellow senior Hamas operative Kahlid Shahyer was also targeted. Watch: Senior Hamas member on strikes in Gaza . But despite what Oren describes as great pains by Israel not to hurt innocents -- including warning Gaza residents in phone calls and leaflets -- scores of civilian casualties have been reported. In Gaza City, for example, a neighbor at al-Shifa Hospital held the body Friday of 4-year-old Mahmoud Sadalah, who his father described as ""very sweet"" and intelligent. The boy is among eight children killed in the recent violence, medical sources in Gaza said. Fear, mourning, celebration in Gaza City . At least 101 children and 96 women have been injured in Israeli strikes, a figure that does not include carnage from new attacks late Friday night, said Dr. Mufeed Mkhallalati, the Palestinian health minister. ""As a doctor, as a human, I am crying,"" a doctor at al-Shifa Hospital said. ""I can't do anything for him, because I know he's died. ... And you can't imagine if it's your baby, how do you feel he's a terrorist? Why?"" Egypt vows 'not to leave Gaza alone' With its attacks, Israel is denying Palestinians their rights and efforts to establish an independent state, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Friday. ""This is an aggression against all Palestinian people,"" he said. He cited the deaths of two babies as a result of Israeli airstrikes. One was the 11-month-old son of a BBC journalist in Gaza, BBC Foreign Editor Jon Williams said. Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil got a firsthand look Friday at destruction while on a tour with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh. His rhetoric toward Israel was diplomatic, though his voice was halting as he struggled to get his words out after seeing a dead year-old boy. ""No one can remain still and watch this tragedy unfold in this fashion,"" Kandil said. ""This is impossible. The whole world must intervene, and Israel must abide by the agreements and stop the aggression."" Watch: Egypt condemns Gaza violence . The armed conflict is likely to further erode Israel's fragile relationship with Egypt, which recalled its ambassador to Israel on Wednesday in protest over the ongoing strikes. It also delivered a formal protest to the Israeli government. ""Egypt will not leave Gaza alone, and what is happening there is a blatant aggression against humanity,"" said Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy. His Cabinet chief noted, however, that Egypt's peace treaty with Israel is safe. ""But respecting a peace treaty does not mean to stay idle or indifferent to what is going on along our borders,"" said Mohamed Refa'a al-Tahtawi, who promised ""medical, logistical and humanitarian"" support for Palestinians.

"(CNN)Strange though it might seem, there are people who love inflight meals. Stranger still, there are people who love inflight meals so much they want to eat them at home. That's the premise behind a new venture that's begun making deliveries of airline-style dinners to addresses in Germany. ""Some of our customers called us and said we love to eat fresh food, but we don't want to have convenience food,"" says Max Thinius of online produce retailer Allyouneed.com. To answer their call, in August the company teamed with LSG Sky Chefs, the catering arm of German airline Lufthansa to launch Air Food One. Still in an eight-week trial period that Thinius describes as its ""pre-pre-pilot stage,"" the service currently makes once-weekly deliveries in Germany's Dusseldorf and Cologne regions of meals inspired by Lufthansa's business class menus. Menus include steak filets, chicken in pepper sauce and fried cod and retail at about $13. There are also vegetarian options. Thinius says the meals appeal to working parents with kids to feed and to busy business travelers who perhaps don't want to go cold turkey after several days of tucking into delicious airplane food. Menu testing . Air Food One's meals are better than the inflight equivalent, he insists, because they're delivered fresh for customers to heat up themselves instead of being precooked and packed into the metal crates used by commercial aviation caterers. There's also the advantage of being able to eat them with real metal cutlery and -- depending on the customer's domestic setup -- without being repeatedly jostled by the person in the next seat. ""They're astonishingly OK,"" says Thinius. ""I didn't think one could do such stuff that you heat and eat it, but it works. ""It's not as good as if you cook yourself -- unless you can't cook properly -- but it's OK."" The pilot service appears to be going well so far, he adds, but it's still too early to tell if it'll be rolled out further afield. ""If it will be successful we will of course expand, if it's not, we won't. There's a lot of things we have to test, not just if the meals are liked by the customers, but also the logistics."" So for the time being, the rest of us will have to suffer the inconvenience of long-haul travel if we're hungry for inflight flavors. Or we could just settle for a sandwich.

"(CNN) -- European leaders are under pressure from the U.S. to step up the EU sanctions against Russia, following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The U.S. announced expanded sanctions targeting two banks, two energy companies, Ukraine separatists and defense companies last week, before the plane, carrying 298 civilians including 80 children, was shot down above a rebel-controlled area in Ukraine. EU leaders also said they intended to increase sanctions. But in the past the EU has been reluctant to impose U.S.-style sanctions on key sectors of Russian economy.

"Top lawmakers agreed to $1.1 trillion government funding bill late Tuesday, just two days before federal agencies are due to run out of money. The negotiating breakthrough likely means the government will stay open as usual, avoiding a potential shutdown. The release of the bill was held up until late Tuesday night as negotiators haggled over a series of controversial policy provisions. ""This bill fulfills our constitutional duty to fund the government, preventing damage from shutdown politics that are bad for the economy, cost jobs and hurt middle class families,"" said Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat, and Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers, a Republican, in a joint statement. ""While not everyone got everything they wanted, such compromises must be made in a divided government,"" they said. RELATED: Lawmakers hustle to make last-minute spending agreement . The measure bars the District of Columbia from using any money to implement a law the city recently passed to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Many Democrats on Capitol Hill maintain that Washington city leaders should be able to carry out a policy voters supported, but Congress has authority over the city's finances. One of the provisions will allow for increased political donations, specifically the amount donors can give to national parties to help fund conventions, building funds and legal proceedings, such as recounts. Rather just giving the current cap of $32,400, donors would be able to give up to $97,200 for each of those actions -- for a total of $324,000 annually, according to Adam Smith, communications director for Public Campaign, a nonpartisan group that supports campaign finance reform. The talks also yielded a compromise on a school lunch program championed by first lady Michelle Obama. The spending bill includes a measure that gives local school districts some flexibility on how they enforce nutrition standards for whole grain items on menus. Some Democrats are already expressing opposition to a provision that repeals what they view as a key financial regulation that was part of a package of reforms for Wall Street banks. The spending bill does away with a rule that prevented banks from using funds backed by taxpayers to trade derivatives, which they argue contributed to the financial collapse in 2008. Republicans fought to include a series of provisions to bar the Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing some environmental regulations, but many of those were not included in the final bill. The resolution of many of these policy issues is critical to the bill's prospects for passing the House and Senate. With a sizeable bloc of House conservatives vowing to oppose the bill because they don't think it goes far enough to block the President's executive actions on immigration, GOP leaders are relying on Democrats to help pass the bill. The top Democrat on the House Appropriations panel, Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, said, ""I strongly oppose several policy riders included in this final agreement, but I am pleased Democrats were able to eliminate many of the most damaging provisions."" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi was non-committal on whether she would back the bill, but released a statement saying she would discuss it with fellow Democrats, adding that she is ""hopeful."" The House is expected to vote on Thursday. Separately, House GOP leaders are crafting a bill that extends current funding levels for a just couple of days. The House is expected to approve that measure as a backup plan to avoid a shutdown -- in case the Senate is unable to approve the broader spending bill before the deadline at midnight on Thursday. The deal also includes emergency funding to combat the spread of Ebola both in the United States and overseas and provides additional money the Obama administration requested to fight the terror group ISIS by supporting the training and equipping of Syrian rebel groups.","Lawmakers agree to a $1.1 trillion spending package to keep the most of the government funded through 2015 .

"Washington (CNN)John Hinckley won't face charges in the death of former President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, James Brady -- whose death last summer was ruled a homicide, even though it happened more than three decades after Brady was shot by Hinckley. U.S. Attorney Ron Machen's office announced the decision Friday, citing two legal barriers it couldn't overcome in attempting to press new charges stemming from Hinckley's 1981 attempt to assassinate Reagan, during which Brady was shot in the head, outside the Washington Hilton Hotel. Hinckley faced charges related to Brady's shooting during his 1982 trial, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity. ""Because the jury conclusively made this finding, the government would be precluded now from arguing that Hinckley was sane at the time he shot Mr. Brady,"" Machen's office said. The District of Columbia also had a ""year-and-a-day"" rule in effect at the time, which prohibited homicide charges if the victim died outside of that time span. ""The Brady Family respects the decision of the U.S. Attorney's office for the District of Columbia not to move forward with prosecution,"" Brady's family said in a statement Friday. ""We deeply appreciate the extraordinary outpouring of love and support since the Bear's passing. We miss him greatly."" Brady was shot in the head in the Reagan assassination attempt. He survived, but was left with slurred speech and partial paralysis.

"Rome (CNN)A crewless, powerless ship that drifted in the Mediterranean with hundreds of migrants aboard has been towed to an Italian port. Francesco Perrotti, the harbormaster in Corigliano Calabro, said 360 migrants were found on the cargo ship Ezadeen -- 74 under 18 years of age and four pregnant. The Red Cross arrived to greet the migrants leaving the ship. All of them appeared to be in good health and nobody was hospitalized or quarantined, he said. The migrants were being sent to reception facilities. Authorities responded late Thursday to a distress call from the Ezadeen, Italy's coast guard said. It's the second rescue of a crewless vessel off Italy's coast, in what appears to be a worrying new tactic by people traffickers who either abandon the ship or mix with the passengers. Overnight, the Ezadeen was at a standstill 58 miles (93 kilometers) off the city of Crotone in the Ionian Sea, the coast guard said, where rescuers were trying to restart the boat's engines. The Icelandic coast guard said its vessel Tyr towed the stranded ship to shore. The Tyr was unable to dock at a nearer port because of the ship's limited maneuverability, the coast guard said. The Tyr was doing surveillance for Frontex, the European Union border management agency, when it was called in to help. Six Italian and four Icelandic coast guard crew members boarded the Ezadee, the Italian coast guard said. As well as taking control of the ship, they brought food and water for its passengers . UN: 3,000 died in 2014 trying to get to Europe . The Italian air force and coast guard said that weather conditions had made the rescue operation very challenging, with coast guard crew members having to be taken by helicopter to the ship, which is flying the flag of Sierra Leone. The alarm was raised when migrants launched an SOS, said Floriana Segreto, a spokeswoman for the Italian coast guard. Since last September, she told CNN, there have been 15 similar cargo ships carrying mainly migrants from Syria who are wealthier and can pay more than others who are forced to travel on smaller, rickety boats. She cited the International Organization for Migration as saying the price for each passenger was about 6,000 euros ($7,260), with a reduction if there are more than 250 passengers on board. Such cargo ships leave from a Greek or Turkish port with the migrants already on board, she said. They are old merchant ships that ""should not be navigating in the Mediterranean Sea,"" she said, and still have a flag, as in the case of the Ezadeen, or carry a fake flag. They sail in Turkish or Greek waters without rousing suspicion and appear to be normal merchant ships, Segreto said. However, once in Italian ""save and rescue"" operational waters, they launch a mayday via satellite phone to a humanitarian association or directly to the Italian coast guard, she said. The smugglers then either abandon ship or mix in with the migrants. Only when all passengers are questioned on shore do investigators have a chance to identify the smugglers, Segreto said. 'Multimillion-dollar business' Frontex spokeswoman Ewa Moncure drew a parallel between what happened on the Ezadeen and on the Blue Sky M, a freighter that was also apparently abandoned this week by its crew with almost 800 people aboard, most believed to be migrants from war-torn Syria. It docked safely in the southern port of Gallipoli on Wednesday after the Italian coast guard seized control. In each case, human traffickers appear to have employed the same method of using large, decommissioned cargo ships that have been ""brought back from the dead,"" Moncure said. It's a ""multimillion-dollar business"" for those operating such ships, she said. Moncure estimates that each passenger paid $3,000 to travel on the Ezadeen. While their work is focused on border control, Frontex vessels -- provided by EU member states -- are obliged to help in search-and-rescue situations, Moncure said. With ever-increasing numbers of migrants from such countries as Syria and Eritrea putting their lives in the hands of unscrupulous traffickers, their efforts are sorely needed. Faced with a crisis off its shores, Italy launched Operation Mare Nostrum (""Our Sea"") to try to find and rescue stranded migrants. It has now scaled back the project, which cost Italians 9 million euros ($10.9 million) a month from November 2013 to the end of 2014. In October, the European Union announced that Frontex would launch its own operation, dubbed Triton, in the central Mediterranean to help fill the gap. EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, said the new Frontex operation would ""show concrete solidarity to Italy, by reinforcing its border surveillance and supporting its humanitarian efforts."" But, she said, ""It is clear that the Triton operation cannot and will not replace Mare Nostrum."" Ships equipped with cells, quarantine areas . While Operation Mare Nostrum is over in name, Italian naval assets are still carrying out rescues in cooperation with Frontex vessels, which call them in to help. The San Giorgio, a navy ship that was converted to rescue migrants under Mare Nostrum and which was the primary rescue vehicle, is still active in such missions and was used last week to rescue those on board the burning Greek ferry, Norman Atlantic. It is equipped with an infirmary, jail cells for smugglers, quarantine sections for potential Ebola patients, and sleeping quarters for the migrants. CNN went out last month on a Frontex patrol on the San Mino, a Japanese fishing vessel converted into a Spanish coast guard ship. Jose Maria Duenas, commander of the San Mino, said that the crew do see themselves as search and rescue. ""We are not turning migrants back, we are rescuing them,"" he said. Report: 40,000 migrant deaths since 2000 . Dangerous sea routes . Amid continued migrant deaths at sea, rights group Amnesty International warned last month that Triton was ""vastly reduced in scale and area covered"" compared with Mare Nostrum and called on EU nations to step up their efforts. ""People are still taking these dangerous sea routes to get to Europe. If the EU is serious about preventing the Mediterranean from becoming a cemetery, it must be prepared to deploy search-and-rescue operations all along the routes that desperate refugees and migrants are taking,"" said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's director for Europe and Central Asia. A spokeswoman for the EU Commission said Friday that it was closely following the Ezadeen situation. ""The rescues of the Blue Sky M two days ago and of the Ezadeen show that smugglers are finding new ways to enter EU territory,"" she said. ""To prevent such events and to protect the lives of migrants, fighting smuggling will continue to be a priority under the Commission's agenda for comprehensive migration in 2015."" More than 207,000 people crossed the Mediterranean for Europe illegally in 2014, the High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.N. refugee agency, said last month -- almost three times the previous high of about 70,000 in 2011. That's 60% of roughly 348,000 boat migrants worldwide last year. ""Europe, facing conflicts to its south (Libya), east (Ukraine) and south-east (Syria/Iraq) is seeing the largest number of sea arrivals,"" the UNHCR said. More than 3,400 of those seeking to reach Europe last year died, many of them drowning after being trafficked in unseaworthy vessels from the shores of the Middle East and North Africa across the Mediterranean. Journalists Barbie Latza Nadeau and Livia Borghese reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Sweelin Ong and Sara Delgrossi contributed to this report.","About 360 migrants were found on the crewless ship, the harbormaster says .

"Good people, not to mention good tippers, do exist. Christina Summitt knows that for sure now after what happened Saturday night. The paw-print tattoo on Summitt's wrist often leads to conversations with strangers about her love of animals; she's a volunteer with a pit bull rescue group and spends lots of time finding homes for animals of all kinds. While tending bar at the Holiday Inn in Clinton, New Jersey, Summitt got to chatting with a friendly couple before the night got busy. The man asked her if she had dogs of her own; she confided that her ""baby,"" a Great Dane-black Labrador mix named Tucker, was at the veterinary hospital after having emergency surgery hours earlier after he swallowed a hard plastic ball. She was worried about him. The man said something about surgery being expensive. She confided the estimate was around $2,700, but she would do whatever she had to do for the dog, whom she adopted in 2011. Summitt, 37, works three jobs -- full-time as a chef at the hotel, Saturdays as a bartender, and as a food prep worker two days a week at a deli in her town. Her husband works full-time and Summitt has three stepchildren. The couple ordered drinks and dinner at the bar. When it was time to close out their $80 tab, the man filled out the receipt with a tip -- for $1,000. Summitt said she started shaking and crying. She showed the bill to her sister, who tends bar with her, to make sure she was seeing three zeros after the 1. ""I went back over and said 'Sir, I cannot accept this, what is this for, why would you do this?'"" she said. He told her to put it toward Tucker's medical costs. ""I just stood there in shock. I walked around and hugged this couple. They said, 'We'll be praying for Tucker.'"" Hotel manager Michelle Satanik told CNN she followed up with her comptroller and also tracked down the customer this week to verify that the gesture was legitimate. CNN has attempted to contact the generous tipper through Summitt, who kept his name anonymous for his privacy. ""Apparently this man does this quite frequently. Just a really nice guy and humanitarian,"" Satanik said. ""I have never ever seen a $1,000 tip like that."" Summitt shared the story on Facebook and CNN iReport with a photo of the credit card slip and a picture of Tucker being held by her 16-year-old stepson before they left the dog at the hospital for surgery. A Facebook page she follows called ""Why Bartenders and Servers Hate People"" reposted the story on Easter Sunday with this caption: ""This is a place for us to vent but every so often, especially on holidays, we have to be thankful for the amazing customers that are out there."" Summitt says she's since gotten messages of support from all over the world. ""I would also love nothing more than to publicly thank this couple in front of the world. I've never seen a random act give so many people so much hope,"" she wrote. Tucker is recovering at home.","A customer left Christina Summitt a $1,000 tip .

"(CNN)A woman claims in a federal court filing this week that she was forced to have sex with several men -- including Britain's Prince Andrew -- while a teenager, an allegation the Duke of York's camp firmly denies. A royal family spokesman in London labeled the accusation against Prince Andrew ""categorically untrue."" The woman made the allegation in a civil motion filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. Both are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the U.S. government to take a fresh look at its case involving self-made billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation. The investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in 2007 and began serving an 18-month sentence in 2008, said The New York Times. According to The Times and the Washington Post, Epstein was the subject of a federal investigation but a deal allowed him to plead guilty to the lesser state charge and avoid a potential federal case. The four women allege their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated because the U.S. ""government secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement"" with Epstein. According to the new court filing, the women contend they were not properly informed by the government about the ongoing status of a possible federal prosecution. It also claims Epstein used ""powerful political and social connections to secure a favorable plea deal."" Tuesday's filing claims the two new alleged victims were sexually abused and exploited by Epstein, one beginning when she was 15 and the other when she was 16. One of them, referred to as Jane Doe #3 in the document, claims that an accomplice who Epstein ""used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities"" approached her in 1999. That alleged female accomplice allegedly ""regularly participated in Epstein's sexual exploitation of minors"" and assisted Epstein as he made Jane Doe #3 into a ""sex slave"" from 1999 to 2002, the filing says. The court filing makes claims against others allegedly involved ""in Epstein's sexual abuse ring,"" saying, ""Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to politically-connected and financially-powerful people."" Prince Andrew was one of those named, with the filing claiming that Jane Doe #3 ""was forced to have sexual relations with him when she was a minor"" in London, New York and on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. A palace spokesman, who is not named per custom, pointed out Friday that Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, is not a direct party to the ""ongoing civil proceedings in the United States."" Andrew is a son of Queen Elizabeth II and a brother of Prince Charles, the next in line for the British throne. ""As such we would not comment on the detail,"" the palace spokesman said. ""However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue."" Also accused in the court filing this week of sexually abusing Jane Doe #3 was noted law professor Alan Dershowitz. ""Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,"" the filing states. Dershowitz issued an adamant denial, saying the case ""is all about money."" ""The entire story is completely made up,"" Dershowitz said in the statement. ""I have challenged her lawyers for her to repeat these statements in public so that I can sue them for defamation and I have challenged her to file criminal charges against me, because the filing of false criminal charges, which this one is,  is a serious crime,"" he added. A lawyer for Epstein also dismissed the allegations. ""These are stale, rehashed allegations that lawyers are now attempting to repackage and spice up by adding the names of prominent people,"" said Epstein's attorney, Jack Goldberger. ""The allegations, which are outlandish on their face and discredited by the evidence, were made in a civil case in which Mr. Epstein is not a party."" An attorney for the alleged victims, Brad Edwards, said  that he was ""not able to comment beyond our pleadings at this point nor respond to any denials or threats by anyone."" Through Edwards' office, Jane Doe #3 issued a statement saying she is ""looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse. It appears that I am now being unjustly victimized again."" CNN's Phil Gast, Mayra Cuevas and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to two state felonies related to prostitution .

"(CNN)Carnegie Mellon University has one of the top computer science schools in the country. Except maybe not on Monday. That's when the school's admissions office mistakenly sent out acceptance emails to 800 rejected applicants for the university's master's program in computer science.

""You are one of the select few, less than 9% of the more than 1200 applicants ... Welcome to Carnegie Mellon!"" Hours later, the euphoria was quashed by another email saying the acceptance letters were sent by mistake. Carnegie Mellon issued a statement apologizing for the fiasco. ""This error was the result of serious mistakes in our process for generating acceptance letters,"" the university's School of Computer Science said. ""We understand the disappointment created by this mistake, and deeply apologize to the applicants for this miscommunication. We are currently reviewing our notification process to help ensure this does not happen in the future."" Carnegie Mellon's admissions officers forgot one obvious basic rule of email etiquette: Confirm that you've selected the correct recipient. ""It's easy to select the wrong name, which can be embarrassing to you and to the person who receives the email by mistake,"" said career coach Barbara Pachter, author of ""The Essentials of Business Etiquette,"" in an interview with Business Insider. Carnegie Mellon isn't the first university to electronically screw up its admission process. In 2014, Johns Hopkins University mistakenly informed hundreds of early admissions applicants that they had been accepted, according to the Los Angeles Times.

"Arthur Lampitt wouldn't consider himself a car aficionado, but his car was a part of him: He lived with a turn signal stuck lever in his arm for 51 years. He was driving his tan Thunderbird to work one morning in July 1963 when he crashed, an accident so bad that the local radio station reported it as a fatality, he said. Lampitt, 75, of Granite City, Illinois, recalls the accident as a series of unfortunate incidents. It had been raining, and the road was slick with oil. Lampitt had tried to have his tires replaced the day before but couldn't get an appointment. To top it off, one curve along his route was prone to puddling -- and that's where calamity struck. ""After I hit the puddles, I hydroplaned, and I saw the semi truck coming, so I gunned it so I wouldn't hit the semi truck, so that I would make it to the far side of the road, but I didn't make it that far, and I had a head-on collision with the truck,"" Lampitt said. He survived the collision with a broken hip and four or five broken ribs. He says he lay in traction for 10 days before surgeons could operate. ""They wanted me to get past the shock and to make sure I would live. Every time I would breathe, you could hear the click-click of my ribs,"" Lampitt said. ""I had a lot of broken glass that hit me, but I never knew there was anything in my arm."" Lampitt says that 35 years after the crash, he went through a metal detector at a courthouse wearing a short-sleeved shirt. ""My bare arm set the detector off, and it raised the question of what was in my arm,"" Lampitt said. ""I got an X-ray, and it indicated there might have been some kind of tool left in there at the time of the accident. But I thought it was peculiar that (doctors) thought it was a tool but didn't know what kind of tool, and they told me if it's not bothering you, leave it alone."" So he did, for another 16 years. Six weeks ago, the lever started to push its way out of his skin. ""I happened to need to move a couple of concrete blocks, and I picked one of them up with my left hand and moved it 20 feet or so and set it down and carried another one, and that was enough to jolt it loose, and it started protruding through my arm."" His surgeon ""suggested it might be a piece of the automobile. And so I dug up pictures, and we got a picture of the undamaged car with the steering column, and it showed what the turn signal looked like. And it compared to what I remember the rod in my arm looking like on the X-ray, and I compared it to the pictures of the accident where there was nothing there, and I concluded that's what it was. ""The doctor said I probably had a reflex reaction in the accident where I lifted my hands to save my eyes, and that's how (the lever) went into my arm."" The outpatient operation to remove the lever took about 45 minutes on December 31. Lampitt thinks he will give the piece to his doctor. ""My original plan was to make it a keychain, but it has been so corroded having been in my body for 51 years, so I may give it back to the doctor. He expressed interest in it, and I thought I would let him add it to his collection,"" Lampitt said.","A crash in 1963 broke several of driver Aurthur Lampitt's bones .

"Washington (CNN)At least three conservative critics of House Speaker John Boehner, say they'll be voting for somebody else when lawmakers return to Washington next week to officially open the new GOP-dominated Congress, previewing some of the conservative opposition that will greet the Ohio Republican. Rep. Ted Yoho was the latest to publicly announce his decision not to support Boehner for his current position, making the news on his social media accounts Saturday night. On Friday, Rep. Jim Bridenstine pointed to Boehner's moves in December to advance a measure favored by President Barack Obama to fund the government for the next 10 months. ""Speaker Boehner went too far when he teamed with Obama to advance this legislation. He relinquished the power of the purse, and with it he lost my vote,"" Bridenstine said in a statement. Rep. Thomas Massie said Saturday he too would not support Boehner and said he opposed the way Boehner steered legislation the House floor, in some instances without a full 72 hours for lawmakers to read enormous bills. ""During my first two years as a congressman I discovered a significant source of the dysfunction.  I watched the House Leadership,"" said Massie in a statement. Massie and Bridenstine are unlikely to be the only Republican to vote against Boehner for speaker. In a local radio interview first noted nationally by BuzzFeed, Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) said he'd been talking with 16 to 18 conservatives about identifying an alternative candidate for speaker and rallying around that person. RELATED: Scalise brings back Boehner's familiar right flank hangover . A freshman Alabama Republican, Gary Palmer, said in October that he'd told Boehner personally that he wouldn't be voting for him for speaker. ""I told him that if the first thing that I did when I got up there is violate my word to the voters, and break that trust, not only would I lose that confidence, but, immediately in the back of his head, he would be wondering at what point would I break my word to him,"" Palmer told The Birmingham News. Dropping a few of his own party's votes in the speaker's race isn't new for Boehner. When the last Congress kicked off in 2013, there were nine Republicans -- including Bridenstine -- who voted against Boehner, and three others who didn't vote for a candidate for speaker. Most of them had complained that Boehner isn't enough of a hard-liner. Indeed, in Bridenstine's note Friday, he said ""our Constitution is under assault"" because Republicans haven't fought strongly enough against Obama's moves to curb some deportations, restrict environmentally-harmful emissions, shift prisoners out of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility and strike a deal to ease relations with Cuba. The wake of November's massive midterm victories for Republicans, Bridenstine said, was the best opportunity Republicans had to use their funding authority to rein Obama in. ""It seemed Democrats were melting down, Republicans were unified, and all we had to do was buy enough time to get our Republican reinforcements to Washington in January,"" he said. The position that Boehner should be ousted has backing from Republican voters. Sixty percent said they'd pick someone new over Boehner for speaker, according to a survey commissioned by The People's Poll, conducted by Caddell Associates and released this week. Still, it's not clear that there are enough Republicans willing to reject Boehner to throw the vote for speaker into a second round. The GOP holds 247 seats in the House, and Boehner will need a simple majority of 218 to be elected speaker. That means he can afford to lose 29 votes from Republicans -- assuming no Democrats support him. If 30 or more Republicans do oppose Boehner, that would mean another round of voting, with conservatives hoping Boehner would drop out of the running and Boehner's allies likely heaping immense pressure on the hold-outs. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report .","Rep. Ted Yoho is the latest GOP House member to say he won't back John Boehner for speaker .
Other conservatives are expected to oppose Boehner, too -- just as they did in the 2013 speaker's election .

"(CNN)Harvesting papayas is Lemeul Mantey's livelihood. He's determined to get the best out of his trees, which grow in the farming community of Nsawam, west of the Ghanaian capital of Accra. To get the juiciest fruit, careful planning and preparation is vital. ""If you want to kill the weeds, you put on your knapsack sprayer, put in water and chemicals, take your protective clothes and then spray,"" Mantey explains. ""You kill all the weeds, that's the practice."" Ghana may not produce as many papayas (also known as pawpaw) as Nigeria, but the country was formerly a big exporter of the brightly colored commodity. These days, it is pineapple which is key for Ghanaian growers, who exported close to 46,000 tonnes in 2011. Business survival . With labor and input costs increasing for those in the agricultural sector, farmers in the country face enormous pressure to sustain their business. As over 53% of Ghana's total workforce was employed in agriculture in 2013, surviving these harsh conditions is essential for the West African nation. And survival means thinking smart and being business savvy. ""Agribusiness for me denotes the collective business activities that are performed from farm to the dining table,"" explains Malindube Kombase, regional director of Mobile Business Clinic. ""These involve input supply, the production of food and the actual delivery of food to the end user."" The group Kombase runs is devoted to helping farmers and other agricultural workers grow their operations by offering training in good business practices. ""Most agribusiness entrepreneurs are not running their companies as businesses, but rather as lifestyle companies,"" Kombase says. ""Without much vision, without enough corporate governance structures, without proper record keeping systems."" Creative collaboration . The biggest problem Kombase sees with agribusinesses is that key decisions are made by the owners without involving their workers. He considers this management structure as a threat to both the growth and the survival of some agribusinesses. Through its three-month training workshop, Mobile Business Clinic seeks to improve the skills of CEOs, who in turn will have ""better access to appropriate resources for growth."" The benefits of working in a collaborative way are stressed to the participants who at the end of the program form clubs to share ideas and support each other. ""Most [participants] are well experienced and have a lot of skills and experience that would be useful for their colleagues,"" Kombase says. ""These clubs form a repository of skills, knowledge and experience that young entrepreneurs, especially in the agribusiness sector, can rely on to start their businesses and turn it around."" Another potential benefit that could emerge from this collaborative approach is diversifying output. ""Farmers are not looking for hand-outs,"" says Michael Abu Sakara Foster, agribusiness executive for Sacco Farms.""[We can] really raise the contribution of agriculture to the GDP, and in fact, diversify the kind of crops that we depend on and also make the economy more robust."" Expanding operations . As well as gaining knowledge from the workshop, some farmers also come away with increased confidence. ""It's very expensive raising chickens in Ghana,"" explains Anthony Korkuvi, who runs an egg business with his wife in Nsawam. ""Chicks are very expensive, then the feed is also very expensive, and then. at times, diseases also disturb us -- especially if you don't give them the right vaccinations."" Having recently completed the training, Korkuvi is now beginning to think big. His plans include expanding beyond Nsawam, and to possibly even Accra. Such a move would require external capital investment. ""There is enough funding available for agribusiness entrepreneurs but most investors would want to see some structures in the businesses in order to have enough confidence to put their money in,"" argues Kombase. ""If there are no corporate governance structures, the investor would not be interested."" Pig farmer Nii Daniel, who also produces chicken and papaya, has seen the benefits of learning business skills. ""I have acquired a lot of insight into my marketing strategy and administration,"" Daniel explains. ""Now I can be able to prepare my own accounts. I have also gotten [to know] that I have to involve the workers, the attendants in my vision, my program. Because I have to let them know the program we have for the farm -- they should also be part of it."" Part of this collaborative approach is involving his neighbor, cattle man Malik Abdul. Now, when Daniel has a problem Abdul is ready to help and he too has changed his way of thinking. With a solid business foundation, and the help of some good neighbors, these farmers are confident they will reap the rewards. ""If you can't get inspired by these guys, you won't be inspired by anything in your entire life,"" says Kombase. ""We need ... to make sure that they grow their businesses, make a few dollars, but contribute a lot to the food security, not just in Ghana, but in Africa.""

"A body found off a central Massachusetts highway has been positively identified as that of Jeremiah Oliver, a 5-year-old boy who was missing for months before police were alerted. Worcester County District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr.'s announcement on Saturday wasn't surprising: One day before, Early had said the body wrapped in a blanket and stuffed inside a bag matched the height and weight of Jeremiah. Still, how he got there and even how he died is still unknown. The district attorney did not detail a cause of death Saturday, explaining the child's autopsy is not yet complete. The case raised questions about the state's role as it relates to Jeremiah's care, with Massachusetts Department of Children and Families Commissioner Olga Roche admitting that there had been ""a serious failure."" ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Jeremiah Oliver"" Roche said Saturday.  ""DCF continues to focus on caring for Jeremiah's siblings to ensure they are receiving the support they need during this very difficult time."" In March, Jeremiah's mother, 28-year-old Elsa Oliver, and her boyfriend, 22-year-old Alberto Sierra, were indicted by a grand jury on charges related to Jeremiah's disappearance as well as on charges of child abuse. Calls to the attorneys for both were not immediately returned Friday. The district attorney's office did not speculate Saturday on whether they might face additional charges now that Jeremiah has been confirmed dead. The last documentation of state authorities' interaction with Jeremiah was in May 2013, according to Department of Children and Families spokesman Alec Loftus. In June, Loftus said, the social worker was told that Jeremiah had moved to Florida to live with his grandmother but did not follow up or verify that. The last visit to the home was in November, when the social worker left behind a business card indicating it would be the Department of Children and Families' final visit, according to Loftus. On December 2, Jeremiah's 8-year-old sister told counselors at her elementary school that her mother's boyfriend, Sierra, had abused her, according to a police affidavit. After those statements, the girl and another brother were taken into protective custody, according to the affidavit. It was in December that authorities realized that the boy was missing. Roche fired the social worker and supervisor assigned to his case because they did not conduct the required in-person, monthly checks on the family, according to a statement released that month.","The body of Jeremiah Oliver, 5, was in a blanket inside a duffel bag, tossed by a highway .

"The NSA has become too big and too powerful.  What was supposed to be a single agency with a dual mission -- protecting the security of U.S. communications and eavesdropping on the communications of our enemies -- has become unbalanced in the post-Cold War, all-terrorism-all-the-time era. Putting the U.S. Cyber Command, the military's cyberwar wing, in the same location and under the same commander, expanded the NSA's power.  The result is an agency that prioritizes intelligence gathering over security, and that's increasingly putting us all at risk.  It's time we thought about breaking up the National Security Agency. Broadly speaking, three types of NSA surveillance programs were exposed by the documents released by Edward Snowden.  And while the media tends to lump them together, understanding their differences is critical to understanding how to divide up the NSA's missions. The first is targeted surveillance. This is best illustrated by the work of the NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) group, including its catalog of hardware and software ""implants"" designed to be surreptitiously installed onto the enemy's computers.  This sort of thing represents the best of the NSA and is exactly what we want it to do.  That the United States has these capabilities, as scary as they might be, is cause for gratification. The second is bulk surveillance, the NSA's collection of everything it can obtain on every communications channel to which it can get access. This includes things such as the NSA's bulk collection of call records, location data, e-mail messages and text messages. This is where the NSA overreaches: collecting data on innocent Americans either incidentally or deliberately, and data on foreign citizens indiscriminately.  It doesn't make us any safer, and it is liable to be abused. Even the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, acknowledged that the collection and storage of data was kept a secret for too long. The third is the deliberate sabotaging of security.  The primary example we have of this is the NSA's BULLRUN program, which tries to ""insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks and endpoint communication devices.""  This is the worst of the NSA's excesses, because it destroys our trust in the Internet, weakens the security all of us rely on and makes us more vulnerable to attackers worldwide. That's the three: good, bad, very bad.  Reorganizing the U.S. intelligence apparatus so it concentrates on our enemies requires breaking up the NSA along those functions. First, TAO and its targeted surveillance mission should be moved under the control of U.S. Cyber Command, and Cyber Command should be completely separated from the NSA.  Actively attacking enemy networks is an offensive military operation, and should be part of an offensive military unit. Whatever rules of engagement Cyber Command operates under should apply equally to active operations such as sabotaging the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility in Iran and hacking a Belgian telephone company.  If we're going to attack the infrastructure of a foreign nation, let it be a clear military operation. Second, all surveillance of Americans should be moved to the FBI. The FBI is charged with counterterrorism in the United States, and it needs to play that role.  Any operations focused against U.S. citizens need to be subject to U.S. law, and the FBI is the best place to apply that law.  That the NSA can, in the view of many, do an end-run around congressional oversight, legal due process and domestic laws is an affront to our Constitution and a danger to our society.  The NSA's mission should be focused outside the United States -- for real, not just for show. And third, the remainder of the NSA needs to be rebalanced so COMSEC (communications security) has priority over SIGINT (signals intelligence).  Instead of working to deliberately weaken security for everyone, the NSA should work to improve security for everyone. Computer and network security is hard, and we need the NSA's expertise to secure our social networks, business systems, computers, phones and critical infrastructure. Just recall the recent incidents of hacked accounts -- from Target to Kickstarter.  What once seemed occasional now seems routine. Any NSA work to secure our networks and infrastructure can be done openly -- no secrecy required. This is a radical solution, but the NSA's many harms require radical thinking.  It's not far off from what the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, charged with evaluating the NSA's current programs, recommended.  Its 24th recommendation was to put the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command under different generals, and the 29th recommendation was to put encryption ahead of exploitation. I have no illusions that anything like this will happen anytime soon, but it might be the only way to tame the enormous beast that the NSA has become.","Director of national intelligence said U.S. should have acknowledged surveillance .

"(CNN)""Sleeping in our caves is a mystical experience,"" says Umberto Paolucci. ""You'll find your spirit and the real essence of life. Even if you're looking for neither."" As the co-owner of Grotte della Civita, a luxury resort dug into a precipice of primeval stones that seemingly rise from nowhere at Matera in Italy's deepest south, Paolucci knows a thing or two about journeys of discovery and redemption. Once a refuge for monks, nuns and hermits fleeing persecution in the Middle Ages, the caves slowly fell into oblivion. For centuries, Matera's 156 rock crypts and maze of grottoes, known as Sassi, were home to ""troglodyte"" outcasts living in inhuman conditions. When inhabitants were driven out in the 1950s, the caves became a haven for prostitutes and junkies. That was before Paolucci stepped in to help oversee their rebirth as a tourism destination. ""When we entered there were illegal dump sites, prostitutes' mattresses, drug addicts' syringes and mistreated pit bulls,"" says Paolucci. Several of Matera's cave dwellings and crypts have been restored as a ""spiritual hotel."" It's a destination that offers an attractive blend of isolation and luxury for anyone looking for some stress busting or soul searching. ""They're enchanted, magical, but real at the same time,"" Paolucci adds. Matera is now a UNESCO World Heritage site, and picked as the 2019 European Capital of Culture. Modern day pilgrims . At the entrance to Sassi, the same crumbling fresco of the Madonna and Child that once greeted monks and hermits (and, legend says, even Templar Knights) greets modern pilgrims. Grotte della Civita (Via Civita 28, Matera; +39 0835 332744) features 18 soberly restyled grotto rooms clustered around a cave crypt that serves as restaurant, cocktail and lounge area. Friars' cells have been turned into deluxe suites. The reception is part of a Benedictine monastery. Below the hotel are two of the city's most ancient and stunning frescoed rock churches: Our Lady of Virtues and St. Nicholas of the Greek, a shooting location for Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ."" It's no ordinary location. When I step inside my 80-square-meter suite, made up of three adjacent grottoes, I'm struck by an unexpected wave of spirituality even as I'm worshiping the accommodation's more earthly pleasures. The suite has a private terrace in the deep gorge of the Murgia Park, cut by a dark river and overlooked by holes carved into the mountain on the other side. Inside there are heated stone floors, arches, vaults and a high ceiling. Niches formerly used for votive paintings, sacred statuettes and incense now hold flickering candles and electric spotlights. A round floor brazier, a cloister bench and an old wooden chest laden with a fruit bowl, ceramic cups, plates and silver cutlery are the sole furniture. I feel like a privileged hermit. ""Real luxury is the fulfillment of one's most intimate and true need,"" says Paolucci. 'Primitive spirituality' ""Paradoxically, only a high-end resort gives the possibility to experience the primitive spirituality of such places."" The other grottoes, including a 160-square-meter deluxe suite for four, feature iron crosses and wooden planks covered with thin mattresses that favor asceticism over comfort. ""To hermit monks these grottoes were places of adoration,"" says Angela Galgano of Un Giro nel Sole tour group. According to resort manager Michele Centonze, there are plans to expand in 2015 with another restyled crypt, 14 new cave dwellings, a relaxation area, library, spa and canteen. Until then, guests wanting to restore soul and body have to settle for a massage (with perfumed oils, burning braziers and new age music) inside their grotto. Evening drinks are served inside the cave church beneath walls that are a puzzle of black holes and candlelit niches. I sit on a tree trunk below two impressive naves leading to an altar, sipping a glass of red Aglianico wine in front of a crackling fire. The rectangular tables are former convent doors, there are church benches, an illuminated confessional booth doubling as a walk-in closet and underground cisterns full of coins. It feels like a ritual or ceremony is taking place. For those seeking the true hermit vibe, the crypt can be booked for an exclusive solo meal with a menu featuring Matera gourmet dishes such as Pezzente sausages and huge sun-dried and fried Cusco chili peppers. Back in my room, it's pitch dark. I search for the matches and light the candles. From the window, Matera looks like a nativity scene. With no television, radio, minibar or magazines, it does feel like I'm leading a monastic life. 'Nuns' thighs' Inspired by my convent-style surroundings, I'm up at 7:30 a.m. the following day. Crossing the rugged rock floor, I open the door to a thick fog covering the chasm below. It feels like I'm in a scene from Umberto Eco's medieval whodunit ""The Name of the Rose."" Breakfast in the cave church is a sensory event soundtracked by a Chopin nocturne playing on a sleek Bang & Olufsen sound system. Simple food is served beneath the altar: tomato pizza, aubergine and potato pie, house-made bread, yogurt, jam, honey and a mozzarella braid surrounded by slices of kiwi and persimmon. There are also plums known as ""nuns' thighs"" due to their unusual shape. Harrison Rubenstein from New York is another early riser. ""This is such a break from daily life. Utterly regenerating,"" he tells me. His thoughts are reflected in comments in the guest book that describe Matera as an ""escape from the world,"" an ""ancestral experience"" offering ""peace and happiness,"" or simply ""Nirvana.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The state of Georgia, stricken by months of drought, confirmed Friday that it will sue the Army Corps of Engineers. A view of the East Point Reservoir in Lithia Springs, Georgia, in 2006 ... Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue had said  Wednesday the state would seek an injunction forcing the Corps to stem the flow of water from Lake Lanier, Atlanta's primary water source. The Corps administers the lake, which supplies most of the water to Georgia's capital and feeds the Chattahoochee River, which winds through three states. Rainfall in the area is about 15 inches below normal for the year. Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin said, ""This is dire, severe, extreme drought."" In the city of Atlanta and surrounding counties, outdoor watering is banned except for a few commercial uses. The state is looking into which businesses would be forced to cut back water use if the drought worsens. The Army Corps of Engineers says there is about a three-month supply of water left in Lake Lanier, which is 15 feet below its capacity. The corps -- under an agreement reached in the 1980s with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state and downstream users -- releases 5,000 feet of water per second from the dam between the man-made lake and the river. The figure was based on a Florida hydroelectric power plant's needs, as well as concern for endangered species in the river, including mussels and sturgeon. But officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials told CNN that no one knows exactly what flow is needed to keep the mussels or the sturgeon alive. Perdue calls the current water flow policy a ""nonsensical action."" ""We shouldn't have to fight this out in court,"" Franklin said Thursday. ""We don't want to hurt [the cities and businesses] downstream but we'd like to see some middle ground and hope people would join with us."" Watch Franklin describe how bad the problem might become » . But even if an agreement is reached soon, the mayor said her city, which has doubled in population since 1980, needs to do a better job of conserving water. Franklin also admitted that the Atlanta area did little to add to storage facilities during years of recent explosive growth, but says the city has now purchased a stone quarry to be developed into a new reservoir. Atlanta is spending $4 billion to fix the city's water infrastructure. According to Franklin, 14 percent of the city's pipes, many of which date back to the 1890s, leak. Though the mayor says the percentage of leaky pipes has dropped each of the last six years. But the remaining repairs will take four to five years and won't address the current crisis. Atlanta may soon have to resort to drastic action like some other Southeastern towns have already taken. In Siler City, North Carolina, residents and businesses have been ordered to cut water use by 50 percent or face penalties. Many restaurants and schools are serving meals on paper plates so they don't have to wash dishes. Two poultry plants have cut production by one day a week to curtail water use and are also trucking water in for other uses. The town of Orme, Tennessee, also trucks in water, three times a week -- for everybody. ""We are high and dry,"" Mayor Tony Ream said. Meanwhile, Franklin has enacted her own personal measures. ""I've cut the time in the shower,"" she said. ""I don't wait for the water to get hot. I kinda shiver for a few minutes. ""I put a bucket in it and I use that collected water to water the two flowers I would like to save."" E-mail to a friend .

"Michael Bay publicly blew off the critics who excoriated Transformers: Age of Extinction, and he's laughing all the way to the bank. Not only did the fourth film in the franchise win the domestic box-office for the second week in a row, but it has already surpassed Avatar to become the biggest box-office hit in Chinese history. After only 10 days in Chinese theaters, Age of Extinction has grossed more than $221 million—$46 million more than it has made in the U.S.—and it likely passed James Cameron's 2009 3-D adventure on Monday. EW: Critical Mass - Come for the Transformers, stay for the critics' zingers . The phenomenal success in China is no accident. Paramount and Bay paid special attention to the second-biggest and rapidly growing movie market after their last film, Dark of the Moon, grossed $165 million there. (In total, Dark of the Moon earned 69 percent of its total $1.1 billion haul abroad.) Giant Transformers exhibit opens in Macau . To gain greater access to Chinese theaters for Extinction, Paramount partnered with a China production company, cast Chinese actors Li Bingbing and Han Geng, shot scenes in China and Hong Kong—where the film premiered—and even sponsored a TV reality-show competition that awarded four small roles. The courtship paid off, with Transformers winning a prime release date in the Chinese marketplace, with few other big American movies opening against it or soon after it. EW: 'Transformers 4' sets up reality TV competition to cast extras and curry favor in China . According to the Los Angeles Times, the red-hot Chinese box office is up another 22 percent this year and is on pace to eclipse the U.S. market by 2018. In many of the dismal reviews of the film, critics sniffed at the moment where the action shifts to Mark Wahlberg's struggling inventor and the screen reads, ""Texas, USA."" As if there's another Texas. But Michael Bay didn't put that detail there for geographically-challenged Americans; it's there for the foreign audience he really made this movie for.

"Vanquished at the polls in a primary upset, Rep. Eric Cantor said on Wednesday that he would step down as House majority leader, triggering a scramble among conservatives to replace him. Cantor's loss to a college professor and political novice on Tuesday in the Richmond-area campaign energized tea party supporters in a midterm year and obliterated his ambition to lead the House. Critics and analysts said he neglected his base at home in Virginia and paid the price. Cantor called the stunning loss a ""personal setback"" at a news conference and appealed for party unity before announcing his decision to vacate the No. 2 job in the GOP hierarchy on July 31. Behind closed doors, however, he addressed fellow Republicans at an emotional meeting where some colleagues were said to have cried and John Boehner reaffirmed his intention to remain speaker. Boehner called Cantor, 51, a ""good friend"" and a ""good leader"" for Republicans. 5 aftershocks from Cantor's stunning upset loss . The heavily favored Cantor lost to college professor and political novice Dave Brat, who ran a spartan effort in Virginia with tea party support. He said negative ads aired by Cantor actually wound up hurting the incumbent because it raised awareness of a race most believed the challenger had no chance to win. He characterized Cantor as more interested in leadership than in the needs of his constituents. Turnout was low, and Cantor lost by 10 points. ""Eric Cantor lost this race as much as Dave Brat won it. He simply violated rule No. 1 of politics: go home,"" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. ""This is Eric Cantor's fault. He was in Washington on primary day, not back in his district."" But Cantor disputed that analysis. ""I was in my district every week, so there's a balance between holding a leadership position and serving constituents at home but never was there a day did I not put the constituents of the 7th district of Virginia first,"" he said. Opinion: Goodbye, GOP; the tea party has won . Musical chairs . The election by secret ballot for Cantor's GOP position is next Thursday, and conservatives are already demanding someone from a red state be selected to represent their views at the leadership table. Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas told reporters he's planning to run for Cantor's post. Current House GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy of California also is expected to do so and would be considered the frontrunner, but Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, the top woman on the leadership team, will stay put. Cantor gave his full-throated support to McCarthy should he run. Cantor said he ""would make an outstanding majority leader."" If he wins, then it would open up the No. 3 spot for someone else. So far Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois plans to run for the whip job if it's available, but would face at least one challenger, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana. More names could emerge. 7 reasons Cantor lost . Harder to get something done . GOP strategist John Feehery, formerly a top Republican congressional aide, said Cantor's defeat throws the GOP conference into chaos and will make it harder to get anything done. The immediate fallout focused on immigration, one issue that clearly illustrates divisions between establishment Republicans and arch-conservatives. Brat pushed the hard-line conservative position on undocumented workers in his anti-establishment campaign, slamming Cantor's support for proposals on issues around legal status. Cantor made a final defense. ""My position on immigration has not changed. It didn't change from before the election, during the election, or the way it is today. You know, I have always said the system is broken, it needs reforms. I think it is much more desirable and frankly doable if we did it one step at a time, working towards where we have common ground and believe things in common,"" he said.

"A well-known medical marijuana researcher at the University of Arizona says a study she's been planning for four years has cost her her job. Dr. Sue Sisley, a clinical assistant professor in the college of medicine, has been with the university for nearly eight years in several capacities. She has been planning a pioneering study on marijuana's effect on veterans with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. ""I was on the forefront of the most controversial research happening at the university,"" said Sisley, the study's principal investigator, said. ""And they did not like the optics of veterans smoking and vaporizing marijuana on their campus, even in the context of a rigorous, FDA-approved, randomized controlled trial."" That trial was designed to look at the safety and efficacy of using marijuana to treat veterans who suffer from PTSD and aren't responding to other approved treatments. Seventy veterans were to participate in the randomized, triple-blind study, in which five different potencies would be used; some would be placebos and others would contain doses of up to 12% tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive ingredient in pot. For decades, studies to determine the medical benefits of cannabis have been few and far between because the Drug Enforcement Agency classifies it as a Schedule I drug -- the most dangerous class of drugs. That puts it in the same category as heroin, LSD and ecstasy. Schedule I drugs are defined by the agency as ""drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" Last year, a search of the U.S. National Library of Medicine revealed 2,000 recent papers on marijuana. But the majority explored the harm of marijuana; only 6% investigated the benefits. It's yet another reason, Sisley says, that this research is important for veterans all over the world. ""All the countries that have vets suffering with PTSD are looking for new treatment options, so the eyes of the world have been on this study for years now and have propelled it forward."" Sisley, a psychiatrist, has been working with vets with PTSD for 15 years. She claims that even with the various government approvals of the study, dating back three years, it was all contingent on the university providing a study location -- something she says they failed to do. Then last month Sisley says she received notice that her three contracts would not be renewed and she feels politics is behind the move. Sisley said: ""They won't give us a reason and they certainly don't want to admit it's political."" She also said her job evaluations and performance have been excellent, adding: ""Job performance is not the issue here. It's about the university being fearful of the word 'marijuana' and not wanting their brand aligned with this research."" But now the university is talking about it. While they will not discuss Sisley specifically, Chris Sigurdson, a university spokesman, told CNN Thursday that several employees, who were not involved in marijuana research, also received non-renewal notices. In a statement they say, ""The University of Arizona does not comment on personnel issues. In regard to marijuana research, in general, in 2013, the UA championed state legislation to ensure that universities could perform medical marijuana research on campus ... The UA has not received political pressure to terminate any employee as has been suggested in some media and other reports."" In fact, Sigurdson says, the university is committed to the study and has reached out to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), which is funding the study. ""We have been in contact with MAPS, assured them that we want to continue the research and will forward the candidate for the principal investigator."" But MAPS is standing by Sisley: . ""We told them that we are glad they are interested in the research, but we haven't agreed to do it with them,"" said Rick Doblin, founder and executive director of MAPS. ""Our goal is still to get Dr. Sisley back her job and we will continue to support her in that. That's our preference."" Right now, they are still working with her. ""We'll be supporting her and her lawyers' efforts to submit an appeal for her reinstatement at the university,"" Brad Burge, MAPS' communications and marketing director, added. ""We expect to receive that proposal for the principal investigator candidate from the University of Arizona, but we are going to continue focusing on Dr. Sisley's appeal to the university."" In the meantime, Sisley, who hopes to get her job back, has hired a lawyer. Politics dealt the research a blow in April. State Sen. Kimberly Yee, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, singlehandedly blocked a bill that would allow the use of surplus state funds toward the study -- and others on the beneficial effects of medical marijuana -- by refusing to allow a hearing for the House-passed bill. Yee would not discuss Sisley's dismissal but said in a statement to CNN: ""This $9 million of state money could otherwise be used for much needed K-12 education programs and drug abuse prevention. There was significant opposition from the Arizona county prosecutors and veteran-led drug prevention groups. I could not in good faith hear the bill in committee when it came to the Senate."" Sisley says veterans deserve this research and she will not give up. ""We will somehow persevere and find a home for this work. So if it's not at U of A it will be somewhere. We are negotiating with several other universities."" On Wednesday, Will Humble, the director of Arizona's Department of Health Services,  wrote on his official ""director's blog"" that he authorized ""the use of marijuana (under AMMA) for patients that are currently undergoing conventional treatment for a diagnosis of PTSD."" However, he says, marijuana could only be used for palliative care of PTSD symptoms, not for the treatment of the disorder. Frieling: Pot is legal and sky hasn't fallen .

"In January, Facebook unveiled Graph Search, a more robust search tool that's being slowly rolled out to users. It uses the mountains of data the site collects to expand what a query on the site can find. Planning a trip and want a list of college friends who have moved to London? No problem. Co-workers who also like ""Game of Thrones?"" Check. How about Facebook photos from National Parks? You got it. And, to take it to a somewhat different place, how about single friends of friends who live in the same city you do? Also doable. Facebook is taking its time. Only a few hundred thousand of the site's hundreds of millions of users have gotten access so far, and the company is tweaking the test version of the feature as it goes. Tom Stocky, product manager for search at Facebook, visited CNN headquarters recently and shared thoughts on the social-media giant's biggest product launch in some time. The following interview has been edited for style and brevity: . CNN: How's the rollout process been so far, and what early customer feedback have you received? Stocky: We're still rolling out very slowly. It's still in beta. Even though hundreds of thousand of people have it now, and that sounds like a big number, Facebook overall features over a billion users so still a small percentage of the user base. However, it's enough where we're starting to get feedback, and the reception so far has been pretty positive. People seem to find it most useful around people and photos queries. Places are the thing they are starting to like as well. And the things we continue hearing in terms of where we need to improve is, we have to do a much better job understanding everything that people type into the search box. Users phrase queries in many different ways and than we initially anticipated and we have to invest in that. For example, the number of different of ways refer to friends. We had to build the product to recognize ""buddies,"" ""pals,"" ""besties"" and all of the other variations of the word ""friend."" How is a Facebook Graph Search different from a Google Web search? It's different in a lot of ways. One obvious way is users are only searching on related results in Facebook with Graph Search as opposed to a Web search where you're searching across all indexed documents on the Web. I think people come to a Web search engine with a different set of expectations -- what they want and expect to do, versus their experience on Facebook, which tends to be socially oriented. Also, with a Web search engine, users are accustomed to typing in a set of keywords and receiving documents from the Web that most closely match -- but with Graph Search, users type in a very specific query using simple phrases to yield relevant results. For example, if users type ""show me my friends who like 'Star Wars,' "" or ""show me my college friends who live in New York,"" Graph Search isn't searching based on those keywords but rather displaying the answers to those specific queries. Review: Facebook's Graph Search is promising but incomplete . What are the most common search trends so far, and how do you expect that to evolve over time? People and photos, by far. Users tend to search and explore their friends, primarily.  My friends who like a certain thing or participate in a specific activity. Show me my friends who like ""Star Wars"" and ""The Godfather"" because I want to have a trilogy party or show me my friends who like running and live in San Francisco. Also seeing more and more people use Graph Search for dating purposes because friends of friends tend to be a good source of potential dates. People queries have mostly been around exploring their friends and a little bit on the periphery of their friends' circles. And there's photos. This is the first time users can look over all of the Facebook photos your friends have shared. Show me the photos of my friends taken before 1995 or show me the photos of my friends in France. A third behavior around using Graph Search for places is also increasing. Users can explore new travel sites, restaurants, etc., through likes and activities of their friends and/or locals. Facebook highlights privacy protection for minors on Graph Search . How could Facebook Graph Search be used for job recruiting or career placement opportunities? As we've discussed, much of the power of Graph Search tool is through the ability to access information of friends of friends because that tends to be very rich data. With career networking, often times the essential edge is via friends of current employees of the desired career opportunity. Graph Search gets you there. Recruiters can also cross-reference applicants with connected friends already working at the company ideal for reference checks or to assist with follow up contact. Graph Search users are also able to query by job title and additional background for a smarter recruiting strategy. Up until now, most people haven't thought of ways to use Facebook professionally, but now there's plenty of reason to do that if recruiters begin to better leverage Graph Search. This should motivate more users to fill out their profile information (employment history, current city, schools) so they can be more easily discovered this way. Internet security is often a sensitive and important issue with new products and services offered on the public Internet. What privacy measures have been accounted for within Facebook Graph Search? We understand people care deeply about how they appear in search. This is an area we've spent quite a bit of time and effort on to ensure that we have an experience that matches people's expectations. The worst thing that can happen around privacy is when people are surprised. This is something we've tried very had to bring to people's attention -- to understand what is searchable about them on Facebook and how they can control it. We offer the Activity Log tool available through the Facebook Timeline feature for easy view and management of what and how users are sharing content and on terms they feel comfortable.","Facebook Graph Search making site's search more robust .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona jury on Monday convicted anti-illegal immigration activist Shawna Forde of murder in the killing of a Latino man and his 9-year-old daughter during a 2009 vigilante raid she led on their home. The Pima County jury convicted Forde on eight counts, including two counts of murder for the shooting deaths of Raul Flores and his daughter, Brisenia, and the attempted murder of the child's mother, Gina Gonzales, at the family's rural Arivaca home on May 30, 2009. The child and her father were American-born U.S. citizens. The jury also convicted Forde on two counts of aggravated assault, and one count each of burglary, armed robbery and aggravated robbery. The jury is scheduled to return Tuesday for the penalty phase of the trial. Forde's alleged accomplices, Albert Robert Gaxiola and Jason Eugene Bush, are scheduled to go on trial later this year. During the trial, prosecutors portrayed Forde as the ringleader of the hit squad, and said she had planned the raid and the murders to steal weapons, money and drugs to finance a new anti-illegal immigration outfit. The trio picked the Flores home, prosecutors said, because of a claim made by Gaxiola they would find drugs there. While Flores had a history of drug-related offenses, none were found in the house. Posing as border patrol and law enforcement officers, Forde, Gaxiola and Bush, whom prosecutors identified as the gunman, showed up at the Flores home after midnight, several hours after the family had returned from a shopping trip in Tucson to buy shoes for their daughter for summer camp. Brisenia Flores was sleeping on the couch with her puppy when the killers demanded to be let into the home. They accused Flores of harboring illegal aliens and said the house was surrounded by agents. Once inside, the gunman shot Flores in the chest and Gonzales in the leg. Later Brisenia was shot as she pleaded for her life. Jewelry taken from the Flores home was later found in Forde's possession. Text messages discovered on her phone also implicated her in the crime. Forde once belonged to the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps before she was removed for what former fellow members described as unstable behavior, according to news reports. Forde then formed a splinter group, Minutemen American Defense. She led protests against illegal immigration and patrolled the Arizona-Mexico border armed with weapons. Bush was the group's national director of operations, according to reports.","Anti-illegal immigration vigilante Shawna Forde is convicted of murder .

"Racist taunts against Italy's first black minister, Cecile Kyenge, took another ugly turn over the weekend when someone hurled bananas at her during a rally. Kyenge's appointment as Italy's minister of integration three months ago isn't sitting well with right-wing radicals whose racial slurs and antics have overshadowed her tenure. The banana incident is just the latest. It took place Friday in Cervia, where Kyenge was speaking to supporters. A man popped up out of the crowd and launched two bananas toward the podium, Kyenge spokesman Cosimo Torlo said. The bananas fell short of the stage, landing between the first and second row of spectators. Giancarlo Mazzuca, chief editor of the daily newspaper Il Giorno, was sitting two chairs away from Kyenge. ""I was able to verify which levels can be reached by human stupidity,"" he wrote in a column. Police haven't found the person who hurled the bananas. There will be increased security around the minister, Torlo said. Kyenge shrugged off the episode -- as she has with the other incidents. In a Twitter post, she called it a sad waste of food when so many people are dying of hunger. Kyenge, who was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, moved to Italy in the 1980s to study medicine. She became an Italian citizen and is an ophthalmologist in Modena. While her ascent to a top government position reflects the success of immigrants, it also has stoked nativism. Ominous mannequins . Just before Kyenge arrived for Friday's rally, a group smeared blood-red paint and anti-immigrant messages onto mannequins. ""Immigration kills,"" read signs attached to the dummies. The far-right political group Forza Nuova (""New Force"") claimed responsibility for the mannequins. The scene was also littered with fliers that said Italy's future growth depends on ""protecting the Italian identity,"" according to the ANSA news agency. Insults from other politicians . Two weeks ago, Italian Sen. Roberto Calderoli likened Kyenge to an orangutan. Calderoli, a member of the anti-immigration Northern League party, made the remarks at a political rally. ""I love animals -- bears and wolves, as everyone knows -- but when I see the pictures of Kyenge, I cannot but think of, even if I'm not saying she is one, the features of an orangutan,"" he was quoted as saying. After his comments were published, Calderoli said ""if I've offended her, I apologize."" ""It was a joke, a comment in a joking way. There was nothing particularly against her,"" he said. ""It was just my impression. ... It is all very well that she be a minister but in her own country. Given that this government needs to govern Italy, I hope that it is done by Italians."" Kyenge responded diplomatically, saying Calderoli ""does not need to ask forgiveness to me, but he should rather reflect on the political and institutional role that he carries. It is on this that he needs to make a profound reflection also to then apologize."" She added, ""Also, he must go beyond putting everything on a personal level. I think the time has come for us to study the problem of communication."" Death threats . Kyenge has also received death threats before visiting an area where the Northern League is powerful.

"(CNN)Really good people. That's how Judy Law of Oxford, North Carolina, described her neighbors Jerome Faulkner, 73, and his wife, Dora, 62. The couple were found dead Thursday by West Virginia authorities, their bodies hidden under a mattress in a red Chevrolet truck after two police officers were shot and wounded at the scene. ""They kept to themselves, but when someone needed them, they were there,"" Law said of the Faulkners. ""I can't even begin to understand why something like this happened."" The first sign of something amiss came Thursday morning, when Law woke to sirens and fire trucks congregating about 500 feet up the road at the Faulkners' home in Oxford. Granville County Fire Marshal Doug Logan said the blaze was set intentionally, destroying the house. Video showed that it left little more than the home's front steps, its foundation and some scorched framing. The county's sheriff, Brindell B. Wilkins Jr., told CNN affiliate WRAL that the Faulkners had been at home when two men came in, set their house ablaze and took off with the couple in their pickup truck. They'd be found dead hours later. ""(Jerome Faulkner) and his wife were good, fine people,"" said Logan. ""They were the kind of people that would give you the shirts off their back. ""Why would anyone want to do this to them?"" West Virginia police shot at during traffic stop . More than 200 miles to the northwest, two police officers from the town of Lewisburg, West Virginia, pulled over a white Chevrolet SUV with North Carolina plates after learning it had been reported stolen. As the officers were conducting the traffic stop on Interstate 64, a red Chevrolet truck pulled up alongside them, West Virginia State Police Lt. Michael Baylous said. The driver of the truck then ""pulled a handgun and shot at both officers,"" he said. Group: Ambush attacks on officers increase . The drivers of both Chevrolets fled. The man behind the wheel of the red truck ""went over the hillside and was eventually taken into custody,"" while the other motorist ""drove behind a guardrail on the interstate and hid for a short amount of time,"" Baylous said. ""Eventually, he walked up to the interstate and turned himself in to law enforcement without incident,"" the State Police lieutenant added. One of the suspects, 21-year-old Eric Campbell, was in the South Regional Jail in Beaver, West Virginia, on Friday, corrections Officer Jonathan Keller said. He is being held on two counts of malicious assault and two counts of attempted homicide, all charges related to the police shootout. His father, Edward Campbell, is now in a West Virginia hospital but will face the same charges, according to Baylous. He said the pair are from Alvin, Texas, a Houston suburb some 1,200 miles from where they were found. ""We believe if the West Virginia police had not have stopped them that this crime spree would have continued on,"" said Wilkins, the Granville County sheriff. ""And it's no telling from the investigation at this point what we're going to find."" Neighbor of victims: 'It's senseless' The West Virginia police officers who the father and son pair allegedly shot and wounded were taken to Greenbrier Valley Medical Center in nearby Ronceverte. Lewisburg Mayor John Manchester said Friday morning that the officers are both doing fine after undergoing minor surgeries. ""I'm thankful that the officers will make a full recovery,"" the mayor said. ""Officers put themselves in dangerous situations every day. You never know what will be following you out the door."" While the Campbells were arrested in the shooting of those two officers, it was not immediately clear what charges the father and son will face in connection with Jerome and Dora Faulkner. Their deaths have already shaken people in Oxford, a tight-knit town of about 8,000 people 30 miles northeast of Durham. Jerome Faulkner was chief of the Cornwall Volunteer Fire Department in Oxford before retiring. One of his two sons, with the Raleigh Fire Department, followed him into the field, according to Logan. Law, for one, is having trouble understanding how something so bad could happen to such good people. ""It's senseless,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- To project elections, CNN and its election experts use scientific statistical procedures to make estimates of the final vote count in each race. CNN will broadcast a projected winner only after an extensive review of data from a number of sources. CNN editorial policy strictly prohibits reporting winners or characterizing the outcome of a statewide contest in any state before all the polls are scheduled to close in every precinct in that state. CNN will receive information from the following sources: . The Associated Press: The Associated Press will provide vote totals for each race. The AP will be gathering numbers via stringers based in each county or other jurisdiction where votes are tabulated. Edison Media Research: To assist CNN in collecting and evaluating this information, CNN, the other television networks and The Associated Press have employed Edison Media Research (EMR). In previous elections, this firm has assisted CNN in projecting winners in state and national races. EMR will conduct exit polls, which ask voters their opinion on a variety of relevant issues, determine how they voted, and ask a number of demographic questions to allow analysis of voting patterns by group. Using exit poll results, scientifically selected representative precincts, vote results from The AP, and a number of sophisticated analysis techniques, EMR also recommends projections of a winner for each race it covers. Collecting data . The process of projecting races begins by creating a sample of precincts. The precincts are selected by random chance, like a lottery, and every precinct in the state has an equal chance to be in the sample. They are not bellwether precincts or ""key"" precincts. Each one does not mirror the vote in a state but the sample collectively does. The first indication of the vote comes from the exit polls conducted by EMR. On the day of the election, EMR interviewers stand outside of precincts in a given state. They count the people coming out after they have voted and are instructed to interview every third person or every fifth person, for example, throughout the voting day. The rate of selection depends on the number of voters expected at the polling place that day. They do this from the time the polling place opens until shortly before it closes. The interviewers give each selected voter a questionnaire, which takes only a minute or two to complete. It asks about issues that are important, and background characteristics of the voter, and it also asks for whom they voted in the most important races. During the day, the interviewer phones the information from the questionnaires to a computer center. Next, vote totals come in from many of the same sample precincts as the exit polls after the voting has finished in those precincts. These are actual votes that are counted after the polls have closed. Election officials post the results so anyone at the precinct can know them. The third set of vote returns come from the vote tallies done by local officials. The local figures become more complete as more precincts report vote returns. The county or township vote is put into statistical models, and EMR makes estimates and projections using those models. In addition, CNN will be monitoring the Web sites of the Secretaries of State offices to help analyze the outcome of early voting and absentee voting. Projections . The projections for CNN will be made from the CNN Election Analysis Center at the Time Warner Center. An independent team of political analysts and statistical experts will analyze the data that will lead to the final decisions on projections. CNN will decide when and how to make a projection for a race depending on how close the race is. In races that do not appear to be very close, projections may be made at poll closing time based entirely on exit poll results, which are the only information available when the polls close about how people voted. The races projected from exit polls alone are races with comfortable margins between the top two candidates. Projections from exit polls also take into account the consistency between exit poll results and pre-election polls. In the case of close races, CNN will wait for actual votes to be tabulated and reported. EMR may make projection recommendations to its clients, but CNN will make all final calls for broadcast. Shortly after poll closing time, CNN may make projections using models that combine exit polls and actual votes. This happens in closer races. For extremely close races, CNN will rely on actual votes collected at the local level. These are the races that cannot be projected when the polls close from exit polls or even from actual votes collected at the sample precincts mentioned earlier. The projection for these races will be based on a statistical model that uses the actual votes. If it is too close for this model to provide a reliable projection, CNN will wait for election officials to tally all or almost all the entire vote. What a projection call means . CNN analysts will make all projections for CNN broadcasts. When CNN's analysts project a winner in a race, whether it is based upon data from EMR or from the CNN computations, it means that when all the votes are counted, CNN projects that the candidate will win the race. A projection is as close to statistical certainty as possible, but that does not mean that a mistake cannot happen; rather, it means that every precaution has been taken to see that a mistake is not made. CNN will not ""declare"" someone a winner because that declaration is up to election officials. CNN will make projections based on our best estimate of how CNN expects an election to turn out. When a lot of vote returns have been tallied, a race may be referred as ""too close to call"" by CNN anchors and analysts. ""Too close to call"" means the final result will be very close and that the CNN analysts may not know who won. For the races that are the closest, the CNN Election Analysis Desk will keep CNN viewers up to date on the state-by-state rules regarding automatic recounts and will report immediately on any official candidate challenge regarding the results or voting irregularities.","CNN receives data from The Associated Press, Edison Media Research .

"Like many small inns in Japan, the riverside Kamigoten Ryokan has been run by the same family for multiple generations. But few can lay claim to a stretch like this. The Ryujin family has been operating this historic Wakayama inn in the Ryujin village in mountainous Kii Peninsula since 1658, when it was constructed for an ancient samurai ruler as a holiday retreat. Twenty-nine generations later, the Ryujin family remains in charge. There's a key reason this beautiful property is still going strong after more than 350 years: beautifying baths. High quality H2O . In hot spring-mad Japan, this ryokan has earned a reputation for its indoor and outdoor bathing pools, the water for which, pumped in from nearby onsens, is high in sodium bicarbonate. Devotees refer to this type of onsen water as ""bijin-no-yu"" -- or beauty bath -- and say it also helps with cuts, burns and chronic skin disease. Cue the skepticism. But as I can attest, there's no denying the waters leave a silky, soft film on the skin post dip, so perhaps there's something to those claims. Do they reverse the ravages laid upon us by the cruel hands of time? Inconclusive. However, when most anti-aging promises come out of a jar or a needle, Kamigoten (or ""Royal Palace"") has the closest thing you'll find to a fountain of youth. Guests have two options --  a gorgeous private outdoor landscaped open-air rock bath overlooking the Hikigawa River or the enclosed shared wooden baths -- one for men, one for women. A remarkable history . Kamigoten is a two-story property that was registered as a ""tangible Japanese cultural asset"" in 1999. Chieko Ryujin, the current owner, says this means they're allowed to modernize the property to ensure it remains pleasing for visitors (i.e. improve the sound proofing on the walls) but the overall structure of the building must not be touched. With its dark brown wood floors and staircases, Shoji rice paper screens and Japanese antiques throughout, it's exactly the type of ryokan travelers looking for that quintessential Edo-era experience will love. Meals -- another excellent feature of the ryokan -- are included in the room rates. Guests are served traditional multi-course kaiseki dinners and breakfast in their rooms. Every dish is made from locally grown produce sourced from the neighboring mountains, some cooked in the onsen mineral waters. Fish is caught from the nearby river. All the rooms, which start from ¥16,200 ($159) per person, are traditional Japanese-style suites with futons that the staff lay out in the evening. The elevated Onarino-ma (room built for the ruler) is where the feudal lord, Yorinobu Tokugawa, used to stay and is the top suite in the building. A town of samurai descendants . There's an interesting back-story to the Ryujin hot spring village. Ryujin was founded by Kobo Daishi (774-835), the man credited with introducing the Shingon school of Buddhism to Japan. Legend has it he had a dream about a water god, who told him the location of the Ryujin hot spring. When Kobo visited the site that appeared in his dream, he enshrined a statue of Yakushi Nyorai, the medicine Buddha. Later, a monk named Myozan came to the village and claimed his skin disease was miraculously cured after bathing in the onsen waters. To show his thanks, he rebuilt the hut where the Buddha was enshrined and named it Onsen-ji Temple. A few hundred years on, during the first battle of the Genpei War outside Kyoto in 1180, famed Japanese poet-cum-warrior Minamoto no Yorimasa was defeated and his troops fled into the Kii mountains. They settled in the Ryujin area and renamed themselves in honor of the village. The owners of Kamigoten are descendants of these fighters. As Japan moved into the Edo period (1600-1868), Ryujin became a popular retreat for top samurai warriors, who were drawn to its thermal waters. It was during this time that Kamigoten Ryokan was built. Getting there . Many travelers visit Ryujin village as an overnight stop on their journey between Wakayama's sacred Koyasan and Kumano areas, which are linked by the beautiful Ryujin-Koya Skyline highway. There's a daily bus that runs all year round from Kii-Tanabe station to Ryujin. The travel time is 90 minutes, tickets ¥1,700 ($16.70). Seasonal buses run from Koyasan, with visitors needing to transfer at Gomadanzan to the Ryujin Bus. Central Koyasan (Senjuin-bashi bus stop) to Gomadanzan is ¥1,690, the Gomadanzan to Ryujin Onsen is ¥1,140. There's more info on bus timetable number 7. Travelers can also book a taxi from Koyasan to Ryujin for ¥16,500 (taxi holds 1-4 people) or ¥19,800 (jumbo taxi for 5-9 people). Travel time is one hour.","Kamigoten Ryokan has been run by the same family since 1658 .

"Washington (CNN)Even when then-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo wasn't running for president in 1992, his presence loomed large over every Democrat in the race. Just ask Bill Clinton. ""For more than two months after I announced, the campaign was shadowed by the specter that there might be yet another candidate,"" Clinton wrote about Cuomo possibly entering the 1992 race in his 2004 memoir. ""Many people thought the nomination was his for the asking, and for a good while I thought he would ask."" Cuomo, who died Thursday at the age of 82, shared a complicated, yet mutually beneficial, relationship with Bill Clinton for much of his life. Though the two sparred early in their careers, they developed a professional relationship that benefited both political families, two of the largest names in both New York state politics and the modern day Democratic party. Bill and Hillary Clinton, in a statement early Friday morning, remembered their ""friend"" Cuomo as ""a sterling orator and a passionate public servant"" whose life ""was the very embodiment of the American dream."" RELATED: Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo dies at 82; we've 'lost a giant' Back in the early 90s, Cuomo was widely seen as Democrats' best chance to unseat incumbent President George H.W. Bush. Clinton, obviously, saw things differently, leading to a very clear rift between the two leaders. Both served as governors in the 80s (Cuomo in New York and Clinton in Arkansas), but that is where most political similarities ended. Cuomo was far more liberal and publicly took shots at Clinton's welfare reform proposals and his connection with the moderate Democratic Leadership Council. The curtness was not one sided, though. When Gennifer Flowers, on a private call with Clinton, said she would not be surprised if Cuomo ""didn't have some Mafioso major connections,"" Clinton simply responded, ""Well, he acts like one."" The Arkansas governor would go on to apologize for the remark. ""I fumed in private and said some things about Mario I regret,"" Clinton wrote in his memoir. ""I think I was so stung by his criticism because I had always admired him."" But Clinton also owed Cuomo. When the New York governor opted not to run for president in 1992, Clinton's pathway opened up. ""On the day Mario Cuomo decided not to run for President, the sigh of relief we Clintonites let out was audible from Little Rock all the way to Albany,"" said Paul Begala after Cuomo's death. At the time he dropped out, polls showed Cuomo up more than 20 points on other Democrats, including Clinton. According to Sandy Berger, a longtime Clinton confidant, Clinton wasn't daunted, though. ""Clinton was disappointed because he was absolutely convinced that he would have beaten Cuomo in the primaries,"" Berger said in an oral history interview for the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. ""He wasn't afraid of Cuomo coming in. He wanted Cuomo to come in. He thought he could beat Cuomo."" RELATED: Obama on death of Mario Cuomo: He was a 'determined champion of progressive values' The Clinton-Cuomo relationship never grew into personal closeness, but it did heal from its early 90s low point. Before the New York primary in 1992, Cuomo said Clinton would make a ""superb president."" And during the Democratic National Convention in New York that year, Cuomo heralded Clinton, telling the adoring audience that ""It's time for someone smart enough to know; strong enough to do; sure enough to lead."" Cuomo even served as a surrogate for Clinton during debates against Bush. Cuomo was a semi-regular presence in the White House, too. After Bill Clinton asked Hillary Clinton to lead his White House's controversial healthcare push, Cuomo jokingly asked, ""What did you do to make your husband so mad at you,"" according to the first lady's memoir. The relationship improved so much that Clinton, according to his aides at the time, came within minutes of nominating Cuomo to the Supreme Court in 1993. ""We tried to get Cuomo to accept the Supreme Court,"" Bernard Nussbaum, the then-White House counsel, told the Miller Center. ""He wouldn't return calls for two or three days. Finally, he did call and told the President he was too busy in Albany. He had some budget — it was crazy, but he turned it down."" Clinton, during a speech in 2012, said Cuomo was ""the first man in the history of this country to turn down a position on the Supreme Court, and it's because he was dedicated to New York."" The complicated nature of the Clinton-Cuomo relationship has not been restricted to the patriarchs of both families, either. Hillary Clinton is widely seen as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2016, but Mario Cuomo's son Andrew, who won a second term as New York's governor in 2014, is considered one Democrat that could challenge the former first lady. RELATED: Cuomo calls for 'respect' between police, community . Bill Clinton arguably gave Andrew Cuomo his biggest political break when the president appointed him Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1997. Hillary Clinton endorsed Cuomo's 2014 campaign, calling the governor ""the right leader at the right time with the right plan"" who ""has worked tirelessly, he has given it his all to make a difference in Albany — no small feat."" And though Cuomo didn't endorse Clinton's possible run -- because she is not yet a candidate -- the governor was effusive in his praise of the former secretary of state. ""Whatever she does, she's gonna be an overwhelming success,"" he told the audience in New York. ""I hope she does something really, really, really big.""

"If you thought the Red Wedding was rough, ""Game of Thrones"" promises more blood and brutality when it returns to HBO for its fourth season on Sunday night (April 6). The season picks up in the aftermath of the devastating wedding reception from hell, which proved, in case it was still unclear to anyone, that in the world crafted by novelist George R.R. Martin in his ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" fantasy series, no one is ever safe. Unlike some series, this season does not take long to heat up. In King's Landing, brutal King Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) is due to be married in an elaborate affair that will bring together a slew of characters, some old and some new, to -- er -- celebrate. So, yes. A wedding in Westeros. What could possibly go wrong? For one, siblings-with-benefits Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and Cersei (Lena Headey) are back together for the first time since Jaime was captured, and partially butchered, in season three, with all the awkwardness that entails. We've already seen that Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) ends up in major trouble (what else is new?) and that new character Oberyn Martell (Pedro Pascal) -- will be attending the joyous occasion with less-than-love in his heart for the Lannisters. As for our other main players: . Daenerys (Emilia Clarke), with an army of freed slaves at her back and a trio of increasingly formidable dragons to keep in line, confronts the promise, and pitfalls, of her ascent to true power. After narrowly missing a longed-for reunion with her family, Arya (Maisie Williams) and The Hound (Rory McCann) face what comes next. As bits of her back story come together, Arya will become arguably season four's first true scene stealer. At The Wall, the coming war between the wildlings and the Night's Watch simmers to a boil, with Jon Snow (Kit Harington)  caught awkwardly in the middle. Look for this conflict to spur some of the epic battle scenes the series, and Martin's novels, are known for. And what of the White Walkers? Elsewhere, Stannis (Stephen Dillane) is down but not out after his defeat on the Blackwater and turns increasingly to the creepy ""Red Priestess"" Melisandre (Carice van Houten) for answers. Bran, with Hodor and friends, continues his mystical trip north to seek what his ""green dreams"" really mean. And, for those of us who can stand to look, we'll see the continuing travails of poor, tortured Theon Greyjoy. In September, I hosted a pair of panels at DragonCon with cast members from the show. James Cosmo (Lord Commander Mormont), Burn Gorman (Karl, the Night's Watchman whose actions lead to chaos at Craster's Keep) and Natalia Tena (wildling Osha) talked about what it means to be a part of the massively popular series. Below are some excerpts from those panels: (Editor's Note: Contains spoilers for season three of the show.) On what has made the show beloved by so many fans: . Cosmo: If I knew that, I'd be a really rich man. I have worked on lots of historical stuff, but I think ""Game of Thrones"" ticks so many boxes for so many people. And its production values are so high, continuously. It's just set a new standard for that sort of television. As far as identifying what it is, I think these shows come along once in a lifetime that people just embrace and it becomes something really special. The books that George Martin had written were so well-loved by so many people, and (show runners) David Benioff and Dan Weiss brought that to the screen so beautifully. Tena: I think it's because it's got that ""Lord of the Rings"" magic, with just a hunk of sex and death thrown at it. And I think that's something we all have a link to and it's also how I imagine the medieval world to be -- brutish and short and sexual. Cosmo: When you said that it was ""Lord of the Rings"" with great sex and violence thrown at it -- well, the sex bit missed me. I am the only guy there who's got this crew of guys and we're all celibate. On the intense fan reactions to the show: . Tena: When you're working you don't think about what something means. You're just thinking about playing a moment, and a truth. I can see now that it means a lot to so many people and that's humbling. But in the moment you're just trying to do the best job you can. Cosmo: When we were doing it, I had no concept about how huge it was going to become. I don't know if anyone did. But from reading the part of Mormont, I just loved the character. He was the one who stood out to me as a man of such innate dignity. It was just a joy to play. On memorable moments from the set: . Tena: We skinned a rabbit. ... (A forest ranger) just plunked a rabbit in front of me and Ellie (Kendrick, who plays Meera Reed) and he showed us how to do it. And, it was fine. But when we did it on the day, after skinning 40 rabbits and pulling their heads off ... all of it congealed. It was a hot day and by the end of the day, I had flies all over my hands. I did go a bit mad. I had, like, three showers. Everyone thinks fish smell and you don't really think about meat. Meat, by the end of the day, is horrible. I felt like Lady Macbeth. I was, like, ""Out, damn spot!"" Pulling their heads off as well -- that was pretty interesting. We ran out of rabbits, so sometimes we had to kind of plunk bits of the bodies back together. It was a special day. Gorman: I wanted to talk about pig s***, if that's all right. That's what I noticed most in Ireland. It's like this really glamorous show and I turn up and it's like, literally, 3-feet depth of pig mess everywhere. I couldn't believe it. I only had a week there and I was like, ""I'm done."" On how he learned his character would die . Cosmo: I'm a dedicated fly fisherman. I fish quite a lot up in Oregon for steelhead. And my fishing buddy who's a few years older than me, Bo -- he hasn't read many books in his life. But when I said I'm doing this thing, ""Game of Thrones,"" he said, ""Oh, man. I'm going to get these books."" We'd be standing up to our waist, trying to catch steelhead in the river ... and he'd say, ""Well, I got to Chapter 23 last night. You're still there, kid."" And then it came to book three and he says, ""I can't see you anywhere, man. He's not talking about you."" So that was my conduit to learning where my career was going -- this old guy standing next to me while we were fishing. On the show's Emmy Award-winning costumes . Cosmo: As you get helped into the leggings and the big leather chest piece and then the cloak, you can feel the sort of gravitas of the character coming. Even the way you walk is informed by these things that drag along behind you; you're almost pulling your cloak behind you. Costuming is a hugely important part of building the character and I wouldn't have it any other way. It does help, although at times it can be a bit annoying and cumbersome. It must have been about 50-60 pounds when it was on. As you see, I'm a lightweight kind of guy (his agency says he is 6-foot-1 and weighs about 240 pounds). But I know when I was wearing all the costume and I was about to get on my horse, he looked really, really unhappy. Tena: With every single character you play, your costume is your outward appearance to the world. ... That immediately determines how the world, and you yourself, see you.","""Game of Thrones"" returns to HBO on April 6 for its fourth season .

"(CNN)The police chief in an upscale community outside Atlanta said he was sleeping when he moved a gun in the bed and accidentally shot his wife in the back, according to a 911 tape released Friday. ""Who shot her?"" the 911 operator asked William McCollom, the police chief in Peachtree City, Georgia. ""Me,"" McCollom replied. ""How did you shoot her?"" ""The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, put it to the side, and it went off,"" McCollom said. ""Is she awake?"" ""No, everybody was sleeping,"" McCollom said. ""No, is she awake now?"" ""Yes,"" he said. Later in the call, the operator asked McCollom, ""Were you asleep also when this happened?"" ""Yes,"" he said. Wife in critical condition . Margaret McCollom, 58, was listed in critical condition Friday at Atlanta Medical Center, according to the hospital. William McCollom, 57, has not been charged with a crime, but he has been put on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. McCollom started out the 911 call by describing the problem: ""Gunshot wound, accidental, need medical ASAP."" He made the call to 911 about 4 a.m. Thursday. He didn't mention he was the top law enforcement officer in the town of 35,000 people until the 1:50 mark in the six-minute recording. The 911 operator asked where the gun was located. At first McCollom said he didn't know, then said, ""I'm the chief of police. The gun is on the dresser."" ""You're the chief of police in Peachtree City?"" the operator asked. ""Yeah, unfortunately, yes,"" McCollom said. 'Come on, guys, get here' In a statement released Friday, the GBI said: ""Chief McCollom has been cooperating with GBI agents working the investigation.  Ms. McCollom will be interviewed when her medical condition improves. When the GBI completes the investigation, it will be turned over to Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard."" At one point in the recording, the operator asked, ""Is that her crying?"" A woman's moans can be heard in the background. ""Yes, she's having trouble breathing,"" McCollom said. At another point, McCollom addresses his wife, ""Are you having trouble breathing, dear?"" ""Come on, guys, get here,"" he says while waiting for the police and ambulance. ""Oh my god, how did this happen?"" When the police arrive, McCollom can be heard telling them the gun is on the dresser. The 911 operator ended the call. Authorities aren't revealing many details, but said in a Thursday press conference that McCollom shot his wife with his service Glock 9mm. McCollom told the 911 operator he had shot his wife twice, but the GBI said investigators determined she'd only been shot once. Peachtree City known for golf carts . McCollom was named the police chief in October after being interim chief for three months, reported CNN affiliate WSB. Peachtree City posted this statement on the city website: . ""City Manager Jim Pennington said, 'This morning, I met with every department manager, and the city of Peachtree City, including the Peachtree City Police Department, is continuing with normal operations.' Peachtree City Mayor Vanessa Fleisch said, 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Maggie and the McCollom family right now, as we wait for the state investigation to proceed.'

In his own eyes at least, this President remains unstained by that failure. Shame remains unknown to this unnecessarily confident man. Now, Obama not only tells us he is shocked to find that the crisis he has ignored is still there, he also insists, ""I will not tolerate it."" If you can't fix the problem, of course, fix the politics. ""No-Drama Obama"" often pretends to share our anger to defuse it. His performance art, however, has grown obvious and condescending. When he throws vacant words like candy to the masses, he only fuels our anger. Still, as satisfying as it might be, we shouldn't assign blame entirely to our commander in chief. For decades, Democrats, Republicans and even veterans -- including Gen. Eric Shinseki, a man of unquestionable commitment and proven leadership skills -- have tried to reform the VA's endless bureaucracy. At best, some have transformed the terrible to the merely awful. At worst, they have all failed wretchedly. Perhaps the problem is neither a lack of will or brains, nor a shortage of effort or good intentions. Perhaps they have not reformed the VA because it cannot be reformed. Even the most devoted instructor can't teach a hammerlike old bureaucracy to be anything but the dull, blunt instrument it is. When the modern VA arose, as veterans came home from World War II, health care was simpler. We were a decade from pacemakers, two from hip replacements and balloon catheters, three from the miracle of an MRI. Medicare had not been imagined, much less genomic testing, treatments for traumatic brain injuries and cures for half of all cancer patients. Since then, caring for human health, like everything else in our lives, has become infinitely more complex. Today, our health care needs are intimate, intricate and intensely personal. Imagine, however, that your health care was managed and delivered by a machine, an old factorylike mechanism composed, not of cogs and gears and smokestacks, but of bureaucrats, regulations and mountainous paper work. Today's Veterans Administration, with 300,000 employees, is exactly such an industrial-age contraption. It's the second largest bureaucracy in our federal government. The VA is a glorified assembly line that excels at enforcing standardization, not delivering compassion, innovation, or personalized service. It is built to dispense soul-crushing conformity. Confronted with providing services that require originality, adaptation and sensitivity, the VA is lost. On what form does a bureaucracy measure compassion, originality, or the respect a veteran has earned? And the worse the VA bureaucracy performs, the angrier all of us become -- and we demand even more regulatory government action. The leviathan that is the VA grows larger as bloat is piled upon excess. In a wonderful new book, ""The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State,"" authors John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge note that enlarging the bureaucratic inadequacies of the modern industrial state are unlikely to improve it. Instead, they found that fixing our government's bloated bureaucracy with even ""more state"" inevitably leads to failure on an apocalyptic level: ""Ninety-four percent of federal IT projects over the past ten years have failed -- more than half were delayed or over budget and 41.4 percent failed completely.""  They note that, ""The Pentagon spent over $3 billion on two health-care systems that never worked properly."" The VA is government-run health care, financed by government, and delivered through government-run hospitals. Liberal collectors of old social antiquities like Paul Krugman cannot let go of it. Krugman confesses, ""Yes, this is 'socialized medicine.' ... But it works, and suggests what it will take to solve the troubles of U.S. health care more broadly."" Document: VA audit report released . Can the fix for the most outdated health care system in America really be more of the same? The breach between what we fund and what veterans get from the VA is getting larger. The gap between our good intentions and the help those in need actually receive is growing broader. It is time for something fresh. Our old federal government's inability to do what it promises is one reason it is less popular than King George III during the American Revolution and Congress, on a good day, has a favorability rating of approximately 9%. Instead of blaming Obama, I'd urge Republicans and Democrats to propose real change:  Transform our old, closed bureaucratic VA system to an open health care system. It's time veterans who don't want to travel five hours or wait for months were allowed equal access to all the health care available to the rest of us. The most critical decisions about a veteran's health shouldn't be made the old way: top-down, politically and artificially, by a pulseless bureaucracy that reports to Washington. Those decisions should be made naturally and bottom-up, closer to life, in the sacred space between doctors and those who have offered the highest possible sacrifice to our nation.

"One of Hallmark's ornaments for the holiday season is snowballing into some controversy following the replacement of the word ""gay"" while quoting ""Deck the Halls."" The red ""Holiday Sweater"" ornament is decorated with the lyric, ""Don we now our fun apparel."" The traditional line from the famous Christmas song is ""Don we now our gay apparel."" The change caused one Facebook user to comment on Hallmark's official page, ""It's OK to be GAY!! Fix your dumb ornament!"" ""You can be sure that myself and many others won't be buying your cards anymore,"" another Facebook user complained. Hallmark defended the change in lyrics. ""When the lyrics to 'Deck the Halls' were translated from Gaelic and published in English back in the 1800's, the word 'gay' meant festive or merry,"" according to a statement released Wednesday. ""Today it has multiple meanings, which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation."" The Hallmark statement went on to explain that the ornament was created in the spirit of ""fun."" ""The trend of wearing festively decorated Christmas sweaters to parties is all about fun, and this ornament is intended to play into that,"" the statement said. ""So the planning team decided to say what we meant: fun."" It added: ""That's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it."" The ornament is for sale on the company's website as part of the Keepsake collection for the price of $12.95.

"Before sitting down with ""Princeton mom"" Susan Patton, I was fairly certain there was nothing I would find redeeming about her or her new book, ""Marry Smart,"" with its message that women should spend 75% of their time in college looking for a man. After all, her letter to the ""Daily Princetonian"" last year, which went viral, outraged many women, myself included, with its message that a woman should find a husband on campus before she graduates. What? Haven't we come a long way, baby, from the days when a woman's only focus was marriage and motherhood? After my hourlong conversation and polite give and take with Patton, a 59-year-old human resources consultant and executive coach, I found myself still not agreeing with much of what she thinks but understanding the reasoning behind her efforts to get the conversation going. I remember seeing a magazine piece shortly after I graduated college in the late 1980s that pictured a 40-something business woman with a title something along the lines of ""I Forgot to Have Kids."" Dating checklists: practical or nitpicky? That image, and the harsh reality at that time for many highly successful professional women, stayed with me for years. I continued my career as a fairly hard-driving news reporter, but in the back of my mind, I knew that I wanted children and didn't want to wake up one day regretting that I never made motherhood a priority. In a small but highly controversial way, Patton may be doing something similar for young women in college who want to get married and have kids someday. ""Honey, keep this in mind. You cannot wait forever to get married and have children,"" she tells them, citing declining fertility rates for women in their 30s. While I understand Patton's desire to have young women feel more comfortable admitting whether they want motherhood in addition to (or in the absence of) a career, I wondered if her delivery, and her words, are doing more to set modern women back. Single woman seeking part-time lover? Patton, who is divorced and whose sons followed her to Princeton (one is still an undergraduate), didn't mince words during our conversation. An edited version of our talk is below: . Kelly: Do you consider yourself a feminist? Patton: Of course, I am fully supportive of equal rights and equal opportunity for women, and I recognize that I am one of the earliest beneficiaries of the good works of the women's movement. ... However, feminism has taken a turn to the dark side. Feminists have become antagonistic. They've become bullying of women who aspire to traditional roles, women who want anything for themselves different from what the feminists, the very strident feminists' doctrine, is directing them towards. Kelly: Forget the feminist label. Many modern women like myself believe in empowering women to make the choices they want to make, and that many women would choose a career and marriage and motherhood, too. Are people without kids happier? Patton: In my experience, I certainly agree that modern women today do want marriage and motherhood. The problem is they're afraid to say so because of the vitriol, because of this antagonist feminist doctrine that would have them believe that marriage and motherhood is somehow not cool. ... It's so retro. It's so backwards. It's so 1950s. Kelly: I don't know if people would say it's so retro. ... You want to be empowered to have the career choices you want to have as well as be a mother and be in a relationship if you want marriage and family, too. Patton: If you delay starting a family and finding a husband until your mid-30s, a few things happen. One, from the perspective of your fertility, you're out of luck or maybe you're out of luck. ... The other component of this, so you're 35, who are you going to be looking at to marry? I'm going to say most women who are 35 are going to be looking for a man around the same age, or maybe a year or two older. So let's take the man of 36. He's quite happy to actually be with a woman 10 years younger. Kelly: You say women should spend 75% of their time in college looking for a man versus 25% on their career. How is that not setting women back professionally in terms of their future careers that you admit are important? Patton: I don't think it hurts them at all because you can make up lost time at work. Work a little harder, it's OK. You can make up that lost time if you are focused on your personal happiness, which I guarantee you will outlast your professional happiness. Your career is going to come to an end eventually. Kelly: Had I married any of my boyfriends in college, I'd be divorced. Patton: I've heard this argument before, that in your early 20s, you don't know who you are going to evolve into by the time you're 30. If you wait until you're 30 to get married, you don't know who you are going to evolve into by the time that you 're 40, but I can guarantee you it'll be somebody very different than you were when you were 30. ... I think the smartest thing that a young woman or a young man can do is find a life partner who shares your values, who shares your love of learning, who shares your intellectual curiosity, who will applaud you, who will encourage you, and who you can grow with and evolve with through the decades. Kelly: I'm lucky. I got married at 36. Patton: Right under the wire. Kelly: You talk about ""Marrying Smart"" and spending more time in college to find that right person, but you have to believe it's also very important for women, at the same time, to be fulfilled and find what they want because their marriage could end; 50% of marriages end in divorce. Patton: I'm saying by all means develop your career, develop your professional self because that's critically important. ... Women have to know that they are responsible for their own safety. They're responsible for their own happiness. I am not saying a man is going to make you happy. I'm not saying that a marriage will make you happy. I hope it does, but don't expect that. Don't expect to only be happy because of your marriage. Happiness comes from within clearly, and obviously nobody knows better than a divorced person how happy a marriage can make you (or) not. Kelly: I cracked up when I read what you wrote: ""Be aware of marrying a dumb guy for good sex. The sex won't improve, and he'll never get smarter."" Patton: There are two barnyard analogies that I cite regularly. The first is men will not buy the cow if the milk is free, and that's the truth. If you give men sex without commitment, you have eliminated the incentive for them to commit. ... An equally important barnyard analogy has to do with just what you're talking about: the bad guys, the crazy boys, just the men you know you shouldn't spend time with. I'm telling women avoid wasting time with the pigs for the sake of a little sausage. Kelly: Can't stop laughing. Patton: It's absolutely true. I understand that women have needs, but not with that. Kelly: You basically say if you require major (cosmetic) bodywork, get it done in high school. That's pretty outrageous. We want to encourage our girls to love themselves. The last thing we want to do is push them to have plastic surgery. Patton: I would never have plastic surgery, and I wouldn't recommend it for anybody except if you have a tragic flaw, something that enters the room before you do such that you are hounded by it, such that it so impacts your self-image. Kelly: How do your sons feel about your newfound celebrity and your views? Patton: There's not a thing that I've said that they haven't heard me say for decades. They are delighted that I found another platform by which to share my views with a broader audience, and they are absolutely delighted that I am having so much fun doing it. Kelly: You have to have a pretty thick skin, I think, to put yourself out there with a very controversial position and not feel the blowback. Patton: It doesn't bother me at all because I am so completely confident in what I'm saying. ... There was nothing in this for me other than my absolute conviction that this is a message that our young women need because all they're hearing is you have to focus on work, work, work. Kelly: Do you feel misunderstood by many women who are criticizing you and who say you are setting women back? Patton: Well, they clearly haven't read what I've written. They've controverted what I've said for their own purposes, or they're so caught up in trying to look politically correct that they've gone in a different direction from where I'm writing. I'm not criticizing anybody. I'm not suggesting that you not pursue a career. I'm just saying if you know this is what you want, plan for it because it doesn't just happen. Kelly: Many people think you are evil. Patton: I'm not the one that's evil. I'm trying to encourage a conversation. I'm trying to bring to the fore a dialogue that's been suppressed. It's the feminists that are looking to continue to suppress the conversation. That's evil.

"The Supreme Court gave limited approval on Monday to public prayers at a New York town's board meetings, citing the country's history of religious acknowledgment in the legislature. The 5-4 ruling came in yet another contentious case over the intersection of faith and the civic arena. It was confined to the specific circumstances and offered few bright-line rules on how other communities should offer civic prayers without violating the Constitution. Two local women sued officials in Greece, New York, objecting to invocations at monthly public sessions on government property. The invocations, according to the plaintiffs, have been overwhelmingly Christian in nature over the years. ""The town of Greece does not violate the First Amendment by opening its meetings with prayer that comports with our tradition,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy said, ""and does not coerce participation by nonadherents."" Just moments before the opinion was announced from the bench, the high court began its public session as it has for decades: with the marshal invoking a traditional statement that ends, ""God save the United States and this honorable court."" The several hundred people in attendance, along with the justices, stood for the brief ceremony. The conservative majority offered varying interpretations of when such ""ceremonial"" prayers would be permissible. Kennedy, along with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, focused on the specifics of the Greece case and did not offer a broad expansion of legislative prayer. Fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia went further, suggesting that even any ""subtle pressure"" that local citizens might feel would not be enough to ban such prayers. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said, ""When the citizens of this country approach their government, they do so only as Americans, not as members of one faith or another. And that means that even in a partly legislative body, they should not confront government-sponsored worship that divides them along religious lines."" 'It's just not appropriate' The town of about 94,000 residents outside Rochester began allowing prayers to start its meetings in 1999, after years of having a ""moment of silence."" Co-plaintiffs Linda Stephens and Susan Galloway challenged the revised policy, saying officials repeatedly ignored their requests to modify or eliminate the practice, or at least make it more inclusive. ""It's very divisive when you bring government into religion,"" Stephens told CNN from her home. ""I don't believe in God, and Susan is Jewish, so to hear these ministers talk about Jesus and even have some of them who personally question our motives, it's just not appropriate."" The town government counters that after concerns from the two women and others, it sought diverse voices, including a Wiccan priestess, to offer invocations. Officials say they do not review the content of the remarks, nor censor any language. ""The faith of the prayer giver does not matter at all,"" said John Auberger, Greece's board supervisor, who began the practice shortly after taking office. ""We accept anyone who wants to come in and volunteer to give the prayer to open up our town meetings."" A federal appeals court in New York found the board's policy to be a violation of the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which forbids any government ""endorsement"" of religion. Those judges said it had the effect of ""affiliating the town with Christianity."" Congress and state legislatures regularly open their sessions with a prayer. The question in part before the court is whether local government bodies are different, in that there might be more active involvement with local residents, who may want to personally petition the town in zoning, tax and other matters. Kagan suggested the court's ruling could lead to sectarian prayers at such government venues as trials, polling places, and naturalization ceremonies. But Alito expressed concern ""some readers will take these hypotheticals as a warning that this is where today's decision leads -- to a country in which religious minorities are denied the equal benefits of citizenship."" ""Nothing could be further from the truth,"" added Alito. ""All that the court does today is to allow a town to follow a practice that we have previously held is permissible for Congress and state legislatures."" Widely varying interpretations . Nearly 120 members of Congress, mostly Republicans, along with 18 state attorneys general, filed supporting legal briefs backing the city. The Obama administration did the same. The high court has generally taken a case-by-case approach on determining just when the state intrudes unconstitutionally into religion, while generally allowing faith to be acknowledged in a limited basis in a public forum. ""In God We Trust"" remains on currency; the Pledge of Allegiance and oaths of office mention a creator; and menorah and crèche displays are permitted in local parks. But the justices, in their widely varying interpretations of this case, acknowledged the tricky line they must walk -- politically, socially, legally-- when deciding Establishment Clause appeals. It was Kennedy's views that ultimately controlled. ""By inviting ministers to serve as chaplain for the month, and welcoming them to the front of the room alongside civic leaders, the town is acknowledging the central place that religion, and religious institutions, hold in the lives of those present,"" he said. ""Indeed, some congregations are not simply spiritual homes for town residents but also the provider of social services for citizens regardless of their beliefs."" The Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented the town in court, agreed. ""The Supreme Court has again affirmed that Americans are free to pray,"" said the group's senior counsel David Cortman. ""In America, we tolerate a diversity of opinions and beliefs; we don't silence people or try to separate what they say from what they believe."" But the ACLU said it was disappointed. ""Official religious favoritism should be off-limits under the Constitution,"" said the group's Daniel Mach. ""Town-sponsored sectarian prayer violates the basic rule requiring the government to stay neutral on matters of faith."" The case of Town of Greece, NY v. Galloway (12-696).

"(CNN)I grew up near the same tree-moss-draped area of Louisiana where U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise met with followers of David Duke, the Klu Klux Klan leader who in the '90s ran for governor and senator in my beloved state. All my values were forged in Louisiana. Values like family, faith, community and the desire to help others. I understand the so-called conservative values that Congressman Scalise championed, including a deep animosity to taxes. Still, his decision to seek the support of voters aligned with a white supremacist shows extremely poor judgment. He already knew where he was on the political spectrum. As Stephanie Grace, a columnist and reporter for the New Orleans' Times Picyaune and now for the Advocate, says, he once told her he was ""like David Duke without the baggage"" -- that is, without the neo-Nazi views. Scalise was 36 at the time of the controversial meeting he is now trying to explain. He says he didn't know anything about the group he was speaking to.  But Kenny Knight, the man who invited Scalise to speak, was known to Scalise as Duke's campaign manager. Knight says he told Scalise they wouldn't talk about race or the Jews.  That should have been a tip-off. Knight says he didn't invite Scalise to address the convention of white supremacists. Instead, he asked Scalise to talk to a neighborhood group, the Jefferson Heights Civic Association, composed mostly of elderly citizens. But Scalise admitted last week that he talked before the European-American Unity Rights Organization,  which the Southern Poverty Law Center considers a hate group.   It advocates white supremacy and wants everybody who isn't like its members to leave the country. Scalise said in an interview last week with NOLA.com that at that stage of his political career, he spoke before any group who asked him.  He added he even addressed the League of Women Voters which ""is a pretty liberal group.""  That's the group composed of Republicans and Democrats who provide identical questions to each candidate and publish their answers without edits so voters can be informed in a nonpartisan manner. A number of Republican Party leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner, came to Scalise's defense. Boehner said Scalise ""made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong.""  There's a tacit acknowledgment in these defenses that Scalise knew who he was addressing. It seems there's a concerted effort to make this a non-scandal. Rep. Cedric Richmond, the lone Louisiana Democrat, defended Scalise as ""not having a racist bone in his body."" I believe that.  But it makes Scalise's appearance much, much worse. So many politicians are so eager to push their particular ideology -- or simply score points -- that they don't consider the larger context.  Was Scalise's anti-tax message so important that it blinded him to the larger value of dignity and equality? Did Scalise consider who he was representing?  It's a delicate line for politicians.  An appearance is an implicit endorsement of acceptable politics. (You don't have to talk about race or Jews).  Our politicians must be held accountable.  Our universal values, such as ""All men are created equal,"" should not be violated in the name of seeking votes. Millions of fallen soldiers who lie in graveyards here and overseas gave their lives defending the principle that every person is individually endowed by God with human rights, and that it's the duty of the government to secure these rights.  Is it alright to dismiss an appearance before a hate group as simply an error in judgment? Peter Wehner is a former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush, and was an adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. ""The party of Lincoln shouldn't have as its #3 a keynoter at a white supremacist convention,"" he said on Twitter. There is a broader issue here than Scalise and his appearance before a hate group.  How much better if our politicians took account of themselves first, rather than acting from a perspective of privilege that they can seek votes where they wish without consequences. We still have a ways to travel in the 21st century.","Donna Brazile: Rep. Scalise explains meeting with hate group as mistaken political appearance .

"In recent weeks, Google Glass has been distributed to its first group of beta testers outside Google and in the real world. As the pool of new smart-glass wearers grows, they are feeling out the etiquette of using the new technology. In more jaded settings, people wearing Glass are casually ignored; their recent life choice to wear a piece of computing hardware wrapped around the front of their faces doesn't register as unusual. The reactions increase, though, the farther away they go from the safety zones of the Google campus, Silicon Valley and, last week, the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco, where the Google I/O Developers conference was being held. The first reaction from strangers is usually excitement. When the doors opened on a crowded hotel elevator, Google I/O attendee Juan Pablo Risso heard a cry of ""He has Google Glass! Come in! Come in!"" Risso declined and took the next lift down, only to find the excited guests waiting for him in the lobby, ready with questions. Google Maps to get big, personal redesign . Because it is still so new and somewhat rare, Google Glass is an excellent conversation starter. When not being accosted by curious strangers, wearers can use the eyewear to break the ice. A friend of Risso's had luck wearing his to a bar and meeting new people. After the regular barrage of questions (How does it work? Are you using it now?) many strangers ask to try on the $1,500 piece of hardware. The answer is typically no, and some owners will cite Google's terms prohibiting the lending of Google Glass as an excuse. Sometimes, the conversations are behind the wearer's back, and they're not always ""Oohs"" and ""Ahhs."" Glass owners reported hearing people whisper after they passed by. But snickers and sneering are common with any new, really expensive technology. The cost of the devices makes them an easy target; wearing them is still interpreted as a geeky status symbol. ""I think there's definitely a Glass and Glass-not thing, especially in San Francisco. There's a cachet to it,"" said Greg Roberts, founder of dSky9, a company developing a Google Glass app for remembering people and places. Google says you'll know when Glass is sketchy . After the initial shock of seeing Glass in the wild wears off, there are the new and awkward aspects of conversation with someone wearing the tiny screen. When having a casual chat with someone wearing Glass, it can take effort to not stare directly at the shiny gadget instead of into the person's eyes. The finger gesture that people use to dismiss the notifications can be distracting, as can the flash of light on the Glass itself. ""There's definitely an interesting occurrence when the screen lights up with a notification,"" Roberts said. ""I've asked people, 'did you just take a picture?' "" It's difficult for the other person to actually see what's on the screen, but the first question has, in fact, become one of paranoia. Google+: One Google tool to bind them all . Risso dismisses privacy worries, pointing out that his battery would die after just three minutes of video recording anyway. Roberts says people should be a more concerned about government surveillance cameras, which he considers less obvious than a person standing in front of you saying, ""OK, Glass, take a picture."" Just to be polite, some Glass wearers have started pushing the devices up onto their heads like sunglasses when having conversations. After the shock and paranoia subside, there is the annoyance. Can a person really be engaged in a conversation if there are e-mails in the corner of their eye? Advocates for the technology argue that having a screen within eye's reach could actually improve manners in the digital age. People are already habitually checking smartphones that beep and flash regularly with notifications. Instead of reaching for a phone, which can absorb a person's full attention, Glass brings the notifications directly into the line of sight. The camera feature could help fix the problem of people experiencing big moments, such as concerts or a child's birthday party, through their smartphone screens. Instead of taking out a phone, they can keep their eyes on the scene and take a picture at the same time. ""You're just living your life; you're not living through a viewfinder,"" Risso said.","Early Google Glass wearers are figuring out the etiquette of a face-mounted screen .
Many owners are constantly fielding excited or paranoid questions from strangers .
The flickering screen and constant head-touching can be distracting during conversations .

"Reports that Syrian warplanes carried out a cross-border attack on Iraqi towns this week is further evidence of the blurring between the two countries' borders as they face an offensive by Islamic extremists. At least 57 Iraqi civilians were killed and more than 120 others were wounded by what local officials say were Syrian warplanes that struck several border areas of Anbar province Tuesday. These border cities are among those under the control of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, which seeks to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses portions of Iraq in Syria. MAPS: How to understand the crisis . Reports of the Syrian incursion into Iraq is a reminder that the civil war in Syria and the unrest in Iraq are not isolated, but linked in ways that threaten the security of both. Sabah Karkhout, head of Iraq's Anbar provincial council, told CNN that Tuesday's air attacks struck markets and fuel stations in areas such as Rutba, al-Walid and Al-Qaim. ""Unfortunately, (the) Syrian regime carried out barbarian attacks against civilians in Anbar province,"" he said Wednesday. Karkhout said he was certain the warplanes were Syrian because they bore the image of the Syrian flag. ""Also, the planes flew directly from Syrian airspace and went back to Syria,"" he said. Local officials said residents used scopes and other equipment to see details on the warplanes. Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, denied reports that Syrian warplanes struck inside Iraq's border towns. ""We know our airspace. We have not recorded or registered infiltration of our air space from foreign jets, and all the warplanes and helicopters flying over Iraq airspace are Iraqis,"" he told CNN. The head of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, told reporters Wednesday that the warplanes that bombed the Iraqi cities were not Iraqi jets, but he did not have information beyond that. Syrian state media called the reports of a cross-border incursion ""completely baseless"" allegations made by ""malicious media outlets,"" citing a ""Syrian media source."" CNN is seeking a response from the Syrian government in Damascus. Iraq's border region has been targeted by Syria in the past -- as the Syrian conflict escalated in 2012, there was at least one instance where rockets fired from Syria landed in Al-Qaim. Iraq's Foreign Ministry said at the time that it was ready to respond in the event of additional attacks from Syria, but the Iraqi government was noticeably quiet after Tuesday's incursion. The claims come as Iraqi forces continue fighting radical Sunni militants from ISIS. Inside Syria, the government, for the most part, appears to have avoided directly targeting ISIS, even though the group's positions are well known. Only in the last week did the Syrian regime intensify strikes on Raqqa, a city in Syria's interior that is considered ISIS's headquarters. Warplanes carried out seven raids on Raqqa on Wednesday, killing at least 12 people, including a woman and child, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Whether the strikes signify a concerted effort by Syria to intensify its fight against ISIS is yet to be seen. It is also unclear whether the Syrian strikes in Iraq were a unilateral action or were coordinated with the Iraqi government. Al-Maliki slams Sunnis . The sectarian rift in Iraq may have widened Wednesday when Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki blamed his political rivals for ""coordinating"" the crisis. Al-Maliki, a Shiite, accused Sunnis of collaborating with militants and slammed the call to have a national salvation government that would remove him from power. ""Iraq is facing a cross-border terrorist attack that is supported by some neighboring countries,"" al-Maliki said in a televised speech. He appealed to his Shia constituency by saying he is adhering to the wishes of Shiite religious leader Ali Sistani, who called for volunteers to support the Iraqi army and government. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry downplayed al-Maliki's rejection of a salvation government, saying it wasn't something the United States had talked to him about specifically. To the contrary, he said al-Maliki, is committed to the electoral process and creation of a new government that the United States has supported. ""And he committed to moving forward with the constitutional processes of government formation, and that is precisely what the United States was encouraging,"" Kerry said. ""He also called on all Iraqis to put aside their differences, to unite in their efforts against terrorism."" Meanwhile, a U.S. official told CNN that Iran is flying surveillance drones over Iraq. It's not known from where they are being launched. Iran is believed to be providing small arms and ammunition to Iraq, as well as providing intelligence to al-Maliki's government, the official said. Is Baghdad ready for an ISIS attack? Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Baghdad, the eerie emptiness of a major highway raises questions about whether the capital would be prepared for a militant invasion. The Iraqi military insists it's ready to beat back ISIS if the fighters reach Baghdad. A post-battle video purportedly shows army forces celebrating a victory over ISIS just west of Baghdad. The bodies of two militants are draped over the hood of a Humvee. ""Look at those ISIS! We killed them!"" one man says in the video. But the opponents are formidable. ISIS fighters have captured cities and towns across Iraq in its effort to create an Islamic state. And the highway from Baghdad to Abu Ghraib in Anbar province showed few signs of readiness for ISIS. No tanks or big guns could be seen, CNN's Nic Robertson said. What used to be a thriving roadside marketplace now looks like a deserted wasteland. It's unclear what lies farther down the highway, but images on the Internet suggest a dire situation. Photos posted by ISIS show two soldiers sitting cross-legged on the ground, guns pointed at their heads. At least six civilians were killed and 21 wounded Wednesday when an Iraqi military helicopter fired two rockets on a mosque and nearby house in central Ana, in Anbar province, according to police and health officials. Most of the injured were children, who were attending a course on the Quran inside the targeted mosque, the officials said. At least 12 people were killed and 46 others were wounded when  a suicide bomber exploded in a popular coffee shop in Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad, followed by several mortar rounds attacked several locations nearby. At least four people were killed and 11 others were wounded when a car bomb exploded in an outdoor market in Rahimawa in northern Kirkuk, police officials in Kirkuk told CNN. Who has what? Maj. Gen Atta said security forces had regained control of two key border crossings after briefly losing them to the militants. Atta said Iraqi forces, aided by Sunni tribes, retook al-Walid, which connects Iraq with Syria. He also said Iraqi forces regained the Trebil border crossing between Iraq and Jordan. He also said that all towns between Samarra and Baghdad, 80 miles (129 kilometers) to the south, are in the hands of Iraqi security forces. But large swaths of Iraq, particularly in the north and west, have fallen from government control to the hands of ISIS. U.S. officials say they think ISIS now has as many as 10,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria. But  is unknown, officials say, exactly how many are in Iraq because it's not clear how many go back and forth across the Syrian border and how many loyalists have joined ISIS as it has taken over various towns. The spread of ISIS . Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said he fears the strength of radical militants could spill further across borders. ""We've been saying for a while that the rise and spread of extremism and the politics of exclusivity will threaten the security of the entire region,"" Judeh told CNN's Becky Anderson. ""The root cause of ethnic and sectarian division, the root cause of instability and the rise and spread of terrorism and extremism has to be addressed."" MAPS: How to understand the crisis .

"MALAYA VISHERA, Russia (Reuters) -- Russia launched a terrorism investigation on Tuesday after a bomb derailed an express train traveling from Moscow to St Petersburg, overturning carriages and injuring dozens of passengers. Rescuers work at the site of train derailment near the Malaya Vishera village caused by an apparent explosion. ""The train accident was caused by a homemade explosive device,"" Sergei Bednichenko, chief prosecutor for Russia's North West district, told Channel One television. ""A criminal case has been opened under article 205, clause 3, that is terrorism."" The head of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), Nikolai Patrushev, linked the bombing to an insurgency in the south of the country around Chechnya, where Moscow has been fighting a long rebellion against its rule. Officials briefed Russian President Vladimir Putin on the investigation into the train bombing and he asked to be informed of any developments, a Kremlin spokeswoman said. The derailed train was an overnight service travelling on one of the country's busiest rail routes. It is heavily used by businesspeople and foreign tourists. Sixty passengers and train crew were injured in the derailment, and 38 of them were admitted to hospital, a spokeswoman for rail operator Russian Railways said. About 250 people were on board in all. The incident happened late on Monday near the village of Malaya Vishera in the Novgorod region, about 500 km (300 miles) north of Moscow and 170 km from St Petersburg. The bomb was planted on a bridge over a road and left a crater about 2 meters (6 ft) across, eyewitnesses said. The train came off the tracks just after crossing the bridge, a Reuters photographer at the scene said. Russia's Interfax news agency quoted an FSB official as saying the bomb contained 2 kg (4.4 lb) of explosive material. Patrushev said the train bomb was part of a pattern of violence that also included a spate of attacks on security forces and officials in the North Caucasus region around Chechnya. ""We have been able to significantly reduce the ... number of terrorist attacks,"" Interfax news agency quoted Patrushev as saying. ""Nevertheless, the threat of extremism and terrorism has not been removed once and for all."" The Reuters photographer at the crash scene said nearly all the carriages and the locomotive had left the tracks, and at least three carriages were tipped onto their side. ""We heard two explosions, then the train put on the brakes suddenly,"" one conductor on board the train, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters. ""The train shook. A panic started,"" he said. ""We smashed out the glass and helped the passengers out ... The worst damage was in the restaurant car. That is where most of the casualties were."" Rebel fighters linked to Chechnya have used bombs to target passenger trains in the past. In 2003, an explosion tore through a morning commuter train outside Yessentuki, north-west of Chechnya, killing 46 people. In 2005, a passenger train heading from Chechnya to Moscow was derailed about 150 km from the Russian capital. Eight people were treated in hospital. Chechnya's separatist rebels have been weakened by the killing of many of their field commanders. They have not carried out any major attacks outside the North Caucasus for at least a year. But insurgent groups from neighbouring Russian regions -- most of them Islamist militants -- have been increasingly active, ambushing police patrols and bombing army bases. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda's north African wing has threatened to kill a French hostage unless four of its members are released within 20 days. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) made its demand in a statement dated Sunday, said the Washington-based Intelcenter, which monitors Islamist Web sites. The Frenchman, Pierre Camatte, was kidnapped from a hotel in Mali in November. The group wants the government of Mali to free four prisoners in exchange for Camatte's release. ""Let France and Mali be forewarned that we give 20 days to fulfill our just demand or the two governments shall be fully responsible for the life of the French hostage,"" the statement said. Camatte was abducted four days before the group kidnapped three Spanish aid workers from neighboring Mauritania. The Spaniards were still alive as of late December, according to the Spanish government. It has said that it is working toward their release, but has not revealed specifics. In June, AQIM executed a British man after the British government did not give in to its demand to release Abu Qatada, a Jordanian considered to be al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe. In its message on Sunday, the group referred to the execution, saying, ""We also call upon the French public opinion and the hostage's family to pressure (French Prime Minister Nicolas) Sarkozy's government to prevent the repetition of Golden (Gordon) Brown's folly against his British citizen."" The group began life as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, with aspirations to overthrow the Algerian government. About 2004, it joined forces with al Qaeda and extended its reach across North and West Africa, carrying out a spate of kidnappings and deadly attacks.","Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) made its demand in a statement .

"(CNN)The city of Cleveland has transferred the investigation into the fatal shooting of a 12-year-old boy by a Cleveland police officer to the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department, the city announced Friday. Cleveland Police Officer Timothy Loehmann fatally shot Tamir Rice in November in a city park. Police said the boy was reaching for an air pistol in his waistband that the officer thought was a real gun. The lawyers for the youth's family said they they are ""cautiously optimistic"" about the change. ""The Rice family hopes that this investigation yields information about why Cleveland Police failed to conduct a background check with the Independence Police Department before hiring Officer Timothy Loehmann."" said lawyers Benjamin Crump, Walter  Madison and Daryl Parks. ""We are further hopeful that this independent investigation will shed some light on why the police car nearly drove on top of Tamir Rice, and why he was shot less than two seconds after officers converged."" Cleveland Mayor Frank G. Jackson said in a statement: ""This decision to turn the investigation over was made to ensure that transparency and an extra layer of separation and impartiality were established. I believe that the best way to ensure accountability in a use of force investigation is to have it completed by an outside agency."" No charges have been filed. The investigation will be conducted by Chief Clifford Pinkney of the sheriff's office, which will present information to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office for determination of possible charges. The Tamir Rice shooting was one one of several police shootings of African-American males in 2014 that sparked a series of anti-police demonstrations across the United States.

"The U.S. State Department said Thursday it had heard enough from Defense Distributed, the non-profit group at the center of a 3-D gun printing controversy. The department sent a three-page cease and desist letter dated Wednesday to Cody Wilson, the organization's 25-year-old founder and self-described anarchist, demanding that the group remove instructions for printing a handgun with a 3-D printer from its website. Earlier this week Wilson posted a video online showing a single shot being fired from ""The Liberator,"" a plastic handgun that, with the exception of a metal firing pin and a piece of metal included to comply with the Undetectable Firearms Act, was assembled entirely from parts made with a 3-D printer. On the Defense Distributed website, a one-line banner read, ""DEFCAD files are being removed from public access at the request of the US Department of Defense Trade Controls."" The site had been scrubbed of the documents by Thursday afternoon. Wilson later tweeted ""#DEFCAD is going dark at the request of the SOS Department of Defense Trade Controls. Some shapes are more dangerous than others."" At issue was whether Wilson had violated International Traffic in Arms Regulations by posting files on his website allowing users to download and print firearms with 3-D printing technology. ""Defense Distributed may have released ITAR-controlled technical data without the required authorization from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, a violation,"" the State Department's letter to Wilson said. Opinion: 3-D printed guns are a boon for criminals . Regulations that the government alleges Wilson violated would require approval for the design, development, production, manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance or modification of firearms including blueprints, drawings and plans, or just about every aspect required to print a gun using a 3-D printer. The letter also said that Defense Distributed likely didn't get the proper approval to release the technical data it had posted online. Wilson says he founded Defense Distributed as a non-profit and posted the documents in the public domain. ""I have never had to consult them, so I hadn't,"" Wilson told CNN by phone. A State Department spokesperson who declined to be named confirmed that the department had been in contact with Defense Distributed but would not comment further on that particular case. Regulating the export of defense items is a national security issue, the spokesperson said. Wilson, a law student at the University of Texas in Austin, has made no secret of his disdain for the U.S. government in particular and all governments in general. (Defense Distributed makes and sells components with names like ""The Cuomo"" and ""The Pelosi,"" to tweak politicians who support gun control). Wilson told CNN he had complied with the State Department's requests but acknowledges his next step will be to find an attorney who can help him fight for what he believes is a battle about the future of the Internet and the future of information control itself. ""For me, it's important as a symbolic political statement,"" he told CNN Monday. ""And that statement is something like, 'No, the future we imagine is one of personalized manufacture and access to objects. It doesn't matter what the decision is on the Hill ... in this future, people will be able to make guns for themselves.' But for federal authorities trying to put a stop to 3-D gun files, sharing it might already be too little, too late. The files have been posted on international servers outside the reach of the U.S. government's authority, and Wilson notes, ""(The files) have been downloaded from our website more than 1 million times."" Since Monday, politicians nationwide have moved swiftly to attack Wilson's 3-D guns. Lawmakers in California, the District of Columbia, as well as a handful on Capitol Hill said they intend to fight block 3-D gun printing technology.","State Department demands that group remove 3-D gun printing instructions from its site .

"(CNN)With crews from around the world aiding in the search, 30 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of AirAsia Flight QZ8501, Indonesian officials said Friday. What appears to be a piece of the fuselage was found, Singapore's Defense Ministry said. It resembles a window panel. Finding the fuselage and the plane's ""black boxes"" are a priority, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said Friday.  There are 59 teams of divers involved, the agency's chief Bambang Sulistyo said, according to the state-run Antara news agency. The USS Sampson, the U.S. Navy ship that is helping with the search, recovered some of the bodies, the U.S. Seventh Fleet said Friday. Indonesian authorities have identified four of the recovered bodies so far. The first victim they identified, an Indonesian woman named Hayati Lutfiah Hamid, was buried Thursday. Many family members are waiting in Surabaya for news about their loved ones. But with 162 people on the plane when it took off from Surabaya, Indonesia, crews have a long way to go. Who was on the plane . AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said he was traveling Friday to Surabaya to bring the body of flight attendant Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi home. ""I cannot describe how I feel.  There are no words,"" he said on Twitter. The other two people identified are Grayson Herbert Linaksita and Kevin Alexander Soetjipto, Indonesian authorities said. Search efforts are concentrated in a zone covering 1,575 square nautical miles (5,400 square kilometers) that officials believe is the ""most probable area"" to find the remains of the aircraft. But on Friday, waves in the Java Sea as high as four meters (13 feet) were making it hard for divers search underwater. The weather is ""the biggest obstacle,"" said Bambang Hermanu, chief of police in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province, where much of the search operation is based. Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak . Here's more key information about where things stand on Flight QZ8501: . The flight . What we know: The aircraft took off early Sunday from Surabaya, bound for Singapore. Roughly 35 minutes into the flight, the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather. Minutes later, the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar. What we don't know: What happened on board after contact with the plane was lost. No distress call was received. Indonesian aviation authorities have suggested that the plane ascended despite permission being denied because of traffic. Some experts have speculated that the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. Analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position, or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines. Until the main wreckage of the plane is found, along with the flight recorders, experts have little evidence to support their theories. How can a modern airliner vanish? The search . What we know: Search teams found debris and some bodies 100 to 200 kilometers (about 60 to 120 miles) from the aircraft's last known location over the Java Sea, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said. What we don't know: The exact location of the body of the aircraft. An Indonesian search official told CNN on Wednesday that he thought sonar equipment had detected wreckage from Flight 8501 at the bottom of the Java Sea. But the country's search and rescue chief said the plane hadn't been found yet. Bad weather has hindered the search operation. The ones who missed the flight . The investigation . What we know: The key to understanding what happened may be in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, commonly known as black boxes. The black boxes, which are actually orange, are in the tail of Airbus 320-200s. If recovered, they will be taken to a lab in Jakarta, Indonesia, to be analyzed, said Tatang Kurniadi, head of Indonesia's National Committee for Transportation Safety. The batteries powering the ""pingers"" that send acoustic signals have only about 24 days of power left, officials said. What we don't know: Where the plane's remains might have been taken by the elements. Investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage. ""The more bits I can put into my mosaic, the better my picture will be,"" aviation safety expert Michael Barr said. ""The better the picture, the better I can come up with an understanding of what happened."" But the conditions at sea make that work much more difficult than on land. ""In the water, you are working with currents and winds, and so the pieces won't be where they had the initial impact,"" he said. What happens next? The plane and the pilots . What we know: The 6-year-old Airbus A320-200, operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate, had accumulated around 23,000 flight hours in about 13,600 flights, according to Airbus. The plane's last scheduled maintenance was on November 16. Flight 8501's veteran captain, Iriyanto, 53, had 20,537 flying hours, 6,100 of them with AirAsia on the Airbus A320, the airline said. The first officer, Remi Emmanuel Plesel, 46, had 2,275 flying hours, a reasonable amount for his position. What we don't know: Whether technical problems, human error or other issues were involved in the crash. According to information from the Aviation Safety Network accident database, there have been 54 incidents involving the A320. ""In the A320 family, accidents and incidents range from fan-cowl detachment, landing gear collapse, bird strikes, right through to hull losses through pilot error,"" said Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group. ""Most aircraft have teething problems, and in most cases, these are eradicated. Very rarely, these issues cause disasters -- largely because of a culmination of factors that lead to the event,"" Ray said. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Tim Schwarz, Paula Hancocks and David Molko contributed to this report. Journalist Yosef Riadi and translator Edi Pangerapan also contributed.","Thirty bodies have been recovered, 4 identified .

"At least 11 people were killed and six others were injured in Cameroon when Boko Haram militants opened fire on a bus late Thursday, local time, residents said. The attack took place in Waza, a region bordering northeast Nigeria. The Islamist group, which dominates swaths of Nigeria's largely ungoverned north, has increasingly conducted attacks outside of Nigeria, targeting Cameroonian military forces and civilians. At least 23 people were killed in an assault by the militant group in the Mozogo district in Cameroon's Far North Region, said Mijiyawa Bakary, a regional governor. In May of last year, the group kidnapped 10 Chinese construction workers in Waza and killed another worker. The hostages were freed in October.","The attack took place near the border with Nigeria .

"(CNN)The New York Police Department faced a newly pressing question in recent weeks: What constitutes an online ""threat""? Police reviewed hundreds of online postings--and made several arrests--over alleged anti-cop threats made in the wake of the killing of two officers last month. It used to be a lot easier to define threats.  It's not that our dialogue has evolved much.  It hasn't.  Art and music have always spoken about violence in the most graphic terms, whether it's in rap lyrics or Guns N' Roses songs.   Kids have consumed violent art and speech since long before Hansel and Gretel baked a witch in an oven, or Beowulf hacked his way through Southern Scandinavia. The difference today is the delivery system: the Internet and social media. Suppose, after the recent NYPD threats, I posted that I planned to ""swarm on any m... in a blue uniform,"" meaning specifically the ""punk police."" Suppose I promise that ""when I finish, it is going to be a bloodbath of cops dyin.'"" Scary right?  If I tweeted that today, I might expect police at my door.  In 1988, though, there was no Twitter ... or e-mail ... or ""online,"" come to think of it, when the rap group NWA came out with its (famous) ""F*** Tha Police,"" containing those very lyrics.  People then were offended, of course.  But songs on an album just don't seem to contain the same direct threat potential of social media today. There was something very nonspecific about threatening language contained on a commercially mass-produced cassette tape. And when a megastar like Axl Rose sang in 1988 that he had to kill a woman for complaining too much, and bury her in his backyard,  millions heard those lyrics.  That's a much bigger audience than the 13 followers reading some guy's rabid musings on Twitter. So, threatening speech online is not about how viral or far-reaching it is. Our society is not as interested in protecting social media rants as it is in protecting artists because—whether the courts say it or not—we really don't feel as good about protecting dummies.  We will vigorously protect the free speech of legitimate artists, even if we find their work repulsive. Instinctively, however, we draw the line at people whose only creative accomplishments consist of, say, a bitter child custody dispute and access to a Wi-Fi signal.  It seems that if some shmendrik wants to rant on the Internet, he should be able to point to a scintilla of an actual music career to defend his or her language by claiming it is like ""lyrics."" That analysis dovetails nicely with the issues before the Supreme Court in a case called Elonis v. United States.  In Elonis, an ""aspiring rapper"" used violent language on Facebook to rant about his wife, an elementary school and an FBI agent. Under the First Amendment, the court must decide whether a ""threat"" requires proof of the defendant's actual intent to threaten, or if it is enough to show that a ""reasonable person"" would regard the statement as threatening.  If the court ultimately requires proof of actual intent, that test would be a higher burden, and more favorable to defendants.  But even under the ""reasonable person"" standard favored by prosecutors, the hearer of the words must understand them as a threat. Maybe this is why social media has more threat potential, and it's not because it can reach many persons: Social media is more threatening for its potential to reach one specific person—but be overheard by many others.  Maybe that's the key. In that sense, social media threats are less like a musical performance, and more like a menacing phone call placed on speakerphone for others to hear, or a call surreptitiously recorded by your Russian girlfriend (as with Mel Gibson). Social media postings are (generally) not for profit, and they are authored by the speaker alone.  In that sense they feel more like the unfiltered statements of present intent. As protective as we should be of free speech in art, maybe it's time to draw the line at social media.  Then again, I'm biased in a way that perhaps the justices are not.  I'm on social media, and the tweets directed at me from time to time are, let's say, pretty threatening and too profane to reprint here. Maybe the justices would be less inclined to equate the lyrics of Eminem (as Justice John Roberts recently did)  with the poetic musings of frighteningly abusive tweeters if they had more personal experience with social media. The NYPD confronts a similar problem.  How is it to know the difference between a true threat, the work of an artist, or some troll sounding off online? The Supreme Court may contain the brightest minds of our time, but compared with your average 14-year-old, they are Luddites.  I've never seen a hashtag in a Supreme Court opinion, and I seriously doubt the justices spend a lot of time on Instagram.  Tasked as they are with defining threats on social media, will their reasoned opinion reflect a current understanding of how people communicate—or threaten—online? Even if they do, by then the kids will be onto the next thing anyway .","Danny Cevallos: Arrests over tweets threatening NYPD raise issue of when speech is threat .
He says Supreme Court to weigh in soon. Maybe it's time to draw threat line at social media ."
"(CNN)To scuba divers and tourists, Belize's famous ""Blue Hole"" underwater cave is a wonder, one of the ""10 most amazing places on Earth,"" according to the Discovery Channel. To scientists, it's something more: evidence of the drought that is suspected to have led to the demise of the Mayan civilization. New research reinforces that theory, Rice University Earth scientist Andre Droxler told LiveScience. The team drilled cores from the Blue Hole sinkhole and a nearby lagoon. They found that the ratio of titanium to aluminum changed in the ninth and 10th centuries, a period when the Mayan civilization in the Yucatan Peninsula went into decline. More titanium means that heavier rains were affecting the region, since the runoff from the area's volcanic rock is rich in the element. But from about A.D. 800 to 1000, the ratio between the two elements was much smaller, indicating that there was much less rainfall. ""When you have major droughts, you start to get famines and unrest,"" Droxler said. The Mayan civilization, noted for its advances in astronomy and agriculture (not to mention that calendar system that some believed prophesied world devastation on December 21, 2012), dominated the Yucatan in the first half of the first millennium A.D. But by 900, most of the civilization's cities, located in present-day Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and southern Mexico, had been abandoned. The question of why this happened has tantalized scientists and historians for decades. The drought theory isn't new, but the findings of Droxler and his colleagues buttress other studies. In 2012, samples from a 2,000-year-old stalagmite also showed that drought had afflicted the region in the latter half of the first millennium A.D. ""The main finding was that a prolonged drought contributed to the collapse of Classic Mayan civilization,"" environmental archaeologist Douglas Kennett told LiveScience two years ago. Droxler and his colleagues published their findings in Scientific Reports.","Investigation of Belize's ""Blue Hole"" indicates drought did in Mayan civilization .

"You wonder what a visitor from outer space -- or a visitor from the future -- would make of it. It's a scene we take for granted -- six days a week, it has been a routine part of life in every city, town and village in the United States. A man or a woman, carrying a satchel, walks from house to house, from apartment building to apartment building.  No one has summoned the person with the satchel; he or she is expected to show up each day without being asked. It's the postal carrier.  And because the presence of the postal carrier has for so long been such a familiar sight, perhaps only that visitor from outer space or from the future would be startled by what he was observing: . The sight of other people also outdoors, all over town, communicating instantly with each other at the touch of a button, smiling and looking down at the little screens in their palms -- grinning at the through-the-air responses they're receiving from friends, tapping at the screens to reply anew.  Words flying from person to person, nonstop, on the go. As, meanwhile, on those same sidewalks, the men and women with the satchels weave their way through the people with the screens, on their appointed rounds to deliver words by hand. The visitor from space, or from a future century, might think this scene -- mailbag luggers walking amid screen tappers -- is like witnessing ox carts amid hovercraft. As might an efficiency expert, or a business consultant. Which summarizes the continuing headache faced by officials in charge of the United States Postal Service.  The price of a first-class stamp is going up again in the new year: On January 26, it will increase by three cents, to 49 cents per letter.  Federal regulators last week approved the rise on an allegedly temporary basis -- the higher rate is supposed to last for no more than two years -- but no one really expects it to go back down. The Postal Service reports that it lost $5 billion in the last fiscal year -- and this is being presented as good news.  The year before, it lost almost $16 billion.  But there are fewer and fewer envelopes in those satchels, so each stamp will come with a higher price tag; the billions of dollars the Postal Service is required to pay each year to pre-fund health care for future retirees is a burden heavier than anything that would fit into a mail sack. Yet there are reasons to hope that the Postal Service finds a way to stay around for a very long time. The Postal Service, like UPS, FedEx and other private delivery companies, is a stand-alone  business.  It is expected to sustain itself; it does not depend on tax money. But, unlike UPS and FedEx, the Postal Service must go to Congress to get explicit approval for the rates it charges, and for many of the rules under which it operates.  This is why it costs the same amount to send a letter across the country as it does to send a letter to the next town.  This is why mail service is universal -- why those carriers are required to show up each day at virtually every address in the United States. Forty-nine cents may seem like a lot to mail a first-class letter.  But if the Postal Service were to collapse under financial pressures and competition from digital means of communication  -- if the Postal Service had to throw in the towel -- do you really think that UPS or FedEx or some other courier service would take your envelope across the country for 49 cents? Over the Christmas holiday, the failures by UPS and FedEx to get packages to some customers on time were  prominent in the news.  As efficient as UPS and FedEx usually are, the existence and ubiquity of the Postal Service has a lot to do with what keeps them on their toes.  Their business model is: We cost more than the Postal Service, but because of that you can count on us to be reliable and accountable to you.  If the Postal Service were to go away -- if that check on the other carriers, that extra impetus for them to excel, were to be removed -- what would the impact be on customers and businesses?  Could or would the other carriers pick up the slack, at a price that didn't dismay people? One hopeful sign for the Postal Service has come from an unlikely source: Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.  Amazon has announced that it will be delivering its packages on Sundays -- and that to deliver those packages it has arranged to use employees of the Postal Service.  The Postal Service has said that it is glad to have the business.  It without question can use the revenue. Can daily delivery of mail continue forever in a digital world?  It's difficult to imagine how.  In Canada, the postal service has informed citizens that, over the next five years, it will stop all door-to-door delivery of letters and concentrate on delivering packages.  Most Canadians are already asked to pick up letters at community mailbox clusters in neighborhoods or apartment buildings; soon, everyone will.  It's the future. Universal, inexpensive mail delivery in the United States has been one of the miracles of the nation's long story; if someone were assigned to build a system like it from scratch today -- carriers reporting to every U.S. address, six days a week, to drop off mail and see if there is any mail to go out, all for pocket change -- that person would have to concede: It can't be done. But it was done, and, for now, it's still here.  For those who, in the digital era,  casually say that they'd be just as happy if the Postal Service were to simply disappear: . Be careful what you wish for.","Bob Greene: Delivering letters seems from another time in age of text messages, e-mails .

"Washington (CNN) -- Huge inflatable plugs -- now being developed by the federal government to protect subway tunnels from terrorist attacks -- likely could have saved some of New York's subway tunnels from storm-related flooding, according to plug developers, some of whom are wistful that development wasn't completed in time for Hurricane Sandy. The Department of Homeland Security successfully tested a plug in January, using the 16-foot diameter prototype to hold back pressurized water at a test tunnel in Morgantown, West Virginia. Another test to demonstrate the plug's reliability is scheduled for next week. But project managers said only one current-generation plug has been manufactured, and they say they are two years away from marketing them to the nation's transit and highway authorities. Get the latest updates on Sandy on CNN.com's live blog . ""If we would have had these things installed in the right places (in New York), they could have made a terrific difference,"" said Greg Holter of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. ""The problem is we don't have a stock of things that we could put in place. It's not like we have a bunch of these sitting in a warehouse,"" Holter said. ""It's a little frustrating really that we weren't at a better stage at this thing."" ""We've proved that these plugs can hold back water,"" said Dave Cadogan of ILC Dover, the plug's manufacturer. ""I wish we had moved a little bit faster as a team and had gotten this development done."" How giant tunnels protect Tokyo from flood threat . Ever Barbero, a West Virginia University professor who helped develop the idea, says he thought of the plug immediately when he saw a news report that New York was closing the Holland Tunnel in advance of the storm. ""I said to my wife, 'It's a pity that every tunnel doesn't have two of these plugs',"" he said. When he heard reports that tunnels had flooded, he said, ""The first thing that came to us is maybe we have work cut out for the next 20 years. I think now everybody will say, 'I should have plugged this tunnel.' "" Engineers: Dangling crane tied securely to NYC building . But DHS project manager John Fortune, while bullish on the plug, says the plug is not ready for prime time. ""This is an experimental prototype. This is something that is probably two years away or so"" from real-world applications,"" Fortune said. ""It would be like asking Apple, 'Why can't I have an iPhone 6 now?' Because it's somewhere in the lab now. It's not ready to go."" The plug -- simple in theory, but sophisticated in design -- inflates like a balloon to fit the contours of a tunnel, and can reduce leakage to amounts manageable by pumps. Placed on either end of some of the tunnels under New York's East River, the plugs could have prevented flooding, team members told CNN. But plugs would not have prevented water from infiltrating porous underground subway stations and other infrastructure, they said. Katrina, Joplin survivors offer advice to Sandy victims . In all, seven New York subway tunnels and two commuter train tunnels flooded during Monday's record flooding. Some of the tunnels were flooded from track to ceiling and ""it is still too early to say how long it will take to restore the system to full service,"" the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which operates the rail systems, said Wednesday. The Department of Homeland Security began the ""Resilient Tunnel Project"" in 2007, focusing on the threat of terrorist gas attacks and fires in transit tunnels. But almost from the start, developers believed the technology could serve a dual purpose, protecting tunnels from floods during natural disasters. Sandy's impact: State by state . DHS teamed with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, West Virginia University and ILC Dover, a private Delaware company, on the project. An early scaled-down plug, consisting of a single layer, was effective at preventing smoke or gas penetration. But when the team used a stronger, single-layer plug in a full-scale inflation test, the fabric failed, sending the team ""back to the drawing board,"" Fortune said. The current plug consists of three layers, including a tough outer layer that consists of thick webbing made of Vectran, a liquid-crystal polymer fiber. The plugs must be fitted to individual tunnels. ""When you look at these things, you get the idea of a kid's balloon,"" Halter said. But ""they are not at all stretchable. They are specifically made to fit a tunnel of a specific dimension. They are tailor made. Their ability to expand or contract is less than 1%."" Victims fall to Mother Nature's wrath . The plugs can be inflated in about three minutes. But once inflated, they are pressurized with either air or water. The existing test plug is roughly 32 feet by 16 feet and holds 35,000 gallons of water. ILC Dover, which also manufactures spacesuits for NASA, believes the product is ready for the marketplace. ""I'd say the technology is ready for implementation now,"" Cadogan said. ""What we're doing now is in essence confidence testing, multiple deployments, just making sure."" If New York had had plugs, ""I think they could have stopped a fair amount of incursion of water in the transit system,"" he said. Team members say the plugs are cheaper than the leading alternative -- floodgates. The prototype plug cost about $400,000, and costs could go down if the plugs are manufactured in quantities. ""This would be a cheap solution,"" said Barbero, the West Virginia professor. Transportation security officials initially were skeptical that a fabric device would hold back floodwaters, said DHS project manager Fortune. But that skepticism is fading, he said. Developers said this week's disaster in New York will likely increase interest in the Resilient Tunnel Project. Experts warn of superstorm era to come . ""While we don't want to ride the back of a disaster, it's certainly our hope that people will look at this technology,"" Holter said. ""This may be the worst storm ever recorded in the last 100 years, but that's no reason that we won't have another storm that will cause as much damage."" Should DHS have expedited development of the plug? That's a hard question to answer, said terrorism expert Brian Jenkins, director of the National Transportation Security Center at the Mineta Transportation Institute in San Jose, California. While officials can envision a wild spectrum of vulnerabilities, they have finite resources to address them, he said. ""There are lots of solutions that become obvious following a disaster of some type,"" Jenkins said. ""To a certain extent, security is almost always reactive, because it's hard to justify the costs of deploying technology for things that have not occurred. And once they do occur, it's almost impossible to resist spending the money on the technology to prevent a reoccurrence. ""That's the axiom. It's a sad one, but that's the reality.""

"AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Lady Bird Johnson, who was first lady during the 1960s and in her later years became an advocate for beautifying public landscapes, died Wednesday, family spokesman Tom Johnson said. She was 94. Lady Bird Johnson's real name was Claudia. She was the widow of Lyndon Baines Johnson, sworn in as the nation's 36th president on November 22, 1963, just hours after President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Lady Bird Johnson was briefly hospitalized last month with a low-grade fever. She was released and returned to her Austin home on June 28. After suffering a stroke in 2002 that limited her ability to speak, she communicated chiefly by writing. Upon news of her death, Texas Gov. Rick Perry ordered flags in the state to be flown at half-staff. ""Lady Bird Johnson embodied all that is beautiful and good about the great state of Texas,"" Perry said. ""She inspired generations of Americans with her graceful strength, unwavering commitment to family and keen sense of social justice."" The former first lady was born Claudia Alta Taylor in 1912 in Karnack, Texas, a small town near the Louisiana line. She got her unusual nickname while still a toddler from her nurse, who proclaimed the child was as ""purty as a lady bird."" Lady Bird attended St. Mary's Episcopal School for Girls, a junior college near Dallas and then transferred to the University of Texas at Austin. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1933, then stayed an extra year to earn a journalism degree. She hoped to become a newspaper reporter, but those plans changed after she met a 26-year-old congressional aide named Lyndon Baines Johnson.  Watch  the former first lady's life in restrospect » . They married in 1934 after a whirlwind courtship and soon moved to Washington. Early on, Lady Bird Johnson proved herself to be the quintessential political wife. In 1937 she used part of an inheritance to fund her husband's first bid for public office and campaigned with him to win a congressional seat. She used more of her mother's money and Johnson's connections to purchase a faltering Austin radio station in 1942 for $17,500. She turned it around and later used the station as a base for a multimillion-dollar communications company based in Austin. After three failed pregnancies, she gave birth to the Johnsons' first daughter, Lynda Bird, in 1944, followed by Luci Baines three years later. Lyndon Johnson rose quickly in politics, becoming the youngest Senate majority leader. In 1960, Johnson set his sights on the presidency but lost the Democratic nomination to Kennedy. A day later, he agreed to become Kennedy's running mate. Lady Bird Johnson traveled more than 35,000 miles during that campaign. After one of the closest presidential elections in U.S. history, Johnson was sworn in as vice president on January 20, 1961. With Kennedy's assassination, Johnson became the 36th president. As the Johnsons moved into the White House, Lady Bird Johnson ""went around and went to all of the staff that was remaining in their jobs, told them how happy she was to have them there,"" said Leticia Baldridge, Jacqueline Kennedy's former social secretary. ""She needed their help. She needed their support. And, of course, they all just immediately turned from supporting the Kennedys to supporting the Johnsons. That's what the staff does in the White House."" In the landslide election of 1964, Lyndon Johnson won victories in the Northeast, West and Southwest. Of the eight Southern states that many had expected to vote for Republican Barry Goldwater, six went for LBJ -- in part, it was said, because of the first lady's efforts. During her husband's one term as president, Lady Bird Johnson worked tirelessly for the beautification of America, promoting the Highway Beautification Act, which sought to limit billboards. She was also a strong advocate for the Head Start program. Lyndon Johnson died in 1973. In 1982, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center outside of Austin. The center was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in 1998. Its mission is the research and preservation of native plants throughout the United States.

"Becky Hauf had always been told her little town of Pilger, Nebraska, would never see a tornado. Too close to the Elkhorn River, the folklore went. Instead, Pilger got two. At the same time. The rare twin tornadoes that spun through on Monday night wiped out the town's business district, obliterated its fire station and ground 40 or 50 homes into rubble, Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger said. As much as three-fourths of the town of 350 is gone, Unger said. Two people died during the storm -- one a 5-year-old. The second death -- a traffic accident -- was probably weather-related, Unger said. Faith Regional Health Services in Norfolk said 16 people were critically injured in the storms. In southern Wisconsin, a line of thunderstorms that spawned twisters rolled through late Monday and early Tuesday. The town of Madison was hit hard. Mayor Paul Soglin said about 25 homes were damaged by the storm, which caused about $10 million in damages, reported CNN affiliate WKOW. The National Weather Service said it appeared a tornado touched down and lifted several times in the Mineral Point and Verona areas. At least 19 homes in Verona, near Madison, were damaged so badly they were uninhabitable,  WKOW reported. The weather service said two tornadoes touched down in Plateville. No deaths were reported. In Nebraska, severe weather also caused damage in the towns of Wisner, Stanton and Pender. All four communities are within about 40 miles (64 kilometers) of one another, about an hour and a half northwest of Omaha. See damage from Nebraska tornadoes . The National Weather Service also received unconfirmed tornado reports from Iowa, North Dakota and in Wisconsin, where emergency workers were searching homes in Madison and Verona after possible wind damage there, according to police.

Hauf and other employees of the Farmers Co-op in Pilger rode out the storm in the convenience store's cooler. ""It seemed like forever, but I guess it was only a couple minutes, and it was coming down on top of us,"" Hauf told CNN's ""New Day. ""But the coolers held together wonderfully."" When she emerged, the first thing she noticed was the condition of the stock in the store where she'd worked for 20 years.

"(CNN) -- The dream of a white Christmas was turning into a nightmare for some as forecasters predicted a heavy snowstorm would continue on Friday across parts of the central United States. In Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where snowfall totals reached about 14 inches, crews were out in full force Friday trying to clear roads, move abandoned cars and rescue motorists, CNN affiliate KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City reported. Officials told KOCO some motorists were still trapped Friday and likely spent the night in their vehicles, though hundreds were rescued and taken to shelters. Forecasters predicted more snow for areas already covered by heavy snowfall Thursday. The National Weather Service said widespread blizzard conditions would continue in North Dakota through Saturday afternoon, with snowfall totals reaching about 14 inches. Interstate 94 was ordered closed at 4 p.m.  from the Iowa border to the Canadian border due to zero visibility, drifting snow and severe wind gusts, according to a statement from the North Dakota Department of Transportation. The National Weather Service in Bismarck, North Dakota, urged all drivers to stay off the roads, saying they will be ""difficult if not impossible"" to travel on. Blizzard warnings were issued Friday for several counties in Minnesota until 6 p.m., according to the weather service. Winter storm warnings were also issued for parts of Iowa and north central Wisconsin. In north central Kansas, 2 to 6 inches of snow was expected to fall and 6 to 12 inches could pile up across parts of northeast and east central Kansas. Throughout Minnesota, an additional 1 to 3 inches of snow was expected Friday night, and in the north shore area of Lake Superior, 3 to 6 inches could fall, the weather service said. Snowfall accumulation in Duluth, Minnesota, and Proctor, Minnesota, will reach about 2 feet, the National Weather Service reported.

Low visibility and dangerous roads were hallmarks of the storm on Thursday. Oklahoma Gov. Brad Henry ordered every state highway, interstate and turnpike closed Thursday night, hours after declaring a statewide emergency because of the major winter storm. At least five people were killed in Oklahoma during the storm on Thursday, CNN affiliate KWTV in Oklahoma City reported. Three people were killed on state roads when they were struck by cars: A Marlow man who was helping another stranded motorist; a Lawton man who was struck after exiting his vehicle, which had crashed; and a Seminole man who was struck after his car stalled. KWTV also reported a 79-year-old woman was found dead on her porch Friday morning in Midwest City. Officials told KWTV she may have died from exposure. Treacherous conditions Thursday also caused nearly 50 vehicles to collide in a chain-reaction accident Thursday in Midwest City, KOCO reported. The weather at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, where 13 inches of snow fell on Thursday, forced it to close. It re-opened Friday with one operational runway, according to KWTV.

"Washington (CNN)Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's death leaves American liberalism with one fewer voice, but his former colleagues say his words and deeds as governor of New York will echo long after his passing. New York Rep. Nita Lowey, who worked with him as assistant secretary of state before she was elected to Congress, said part of his power was how he couched the liberal ideal of government as a helping hand for the needy in relatable terms. ""What was so important to my development was his absolute conviction that people wanted a hand up, not a handout,"" Lowey said. New York Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf said much of his appeal and legacy — and why he remains a rarity in politics today — is that he was unapologetic in his ideals and beliefs. ""He didn't need any spin doctors. He didn't need to be told what to do. If he had something on his mind he said it, he told you exactly how he felt, and he didn't regret any of it,"" Sheinkopf said. RELATED: Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo dies at 82; we've 'lost a giant' Still, his allies admit that his soaring oratory was at times constrained by the earth-bound realities of a difficult economy and partisan opposition in the statehouse. Former New York Democratic Assemblyman Paul Tokasz said that he was often met with disappointment by teachers' unions and other constituencies in the state with a budget that might have been balanced but didn't do enough for them. ""There were some difficult conditions in the late 80s, early 90s, in terms of fiscal conditions of the state and I think he realized that,"" Tokasz said. ""It's never easy satisfying all of your constituencies."" He remembered that in the early 90s during a year when the governor had promised a certain level of funding for education that he ultimately couldn't deliver on because of the state's financial difficulties, Cuomo admitted during his subsequent state of the state address that ""he was disappointed in himself because as an executive he had failed."" Many of his accomplishments were ""prosaic,"" said Harold Holzer, one of his spokesmen. Cuomo passed the nation's first mandatory seatbelt law, vetoed the death penalty for the dozen years he was in office and supported an assault weapons ban. RELATED: Cuomo and Clinton: A complicated, but mutually beneficial, relationship . At a time when crime was rampant in New York City in particular, Cuomo built more jails in New York than any other governor in the state's history, hardly an accomplishment many liberals would tout but one his contemporaries hailed as fruitful and necessary. Cuomo also named the 90s the ""decade of the child"" and worked to encourage more investment in early childhood education, though many of his efforts on that front didn't bear fruit until he was out of office. Holzer said, however, the little things mattered to the governor. ""The seatbelt law and requiring deposits on bottles seem prosaic, but he liked the nitty-gritty things,"" Holzer said. But the disappointments of his tenure might be overshadowed by his use of a lofty rhetorical talent to defend and promote his unapologetically liberal beliefs. Cuomo's value as an ""eloquent voice for the voiceless,"" Holzer said, was ""difficult to discount,"" at a time when many of the liberal beliefs he espoused were taking a pummeling in the public sphere by Republicans, led by then-President Ronald Reagan. RELATED: Obama on death of Mario Cuomo: He was a 'determined champion of progressive values' ""His impact was reminding people of conscience that there were issues left to be addressed,"" he said, remembering his 1984 Democratic National Convention speech -- and landmark public event . It was a voice that ""brought morality into the public sphere and kept it there,"" Sheinkopf said, by issuing a fiery and convincing speech defending legal abortion, despite his deep Catholic beliefs, in an address to Notre Dame University. ""It took tremendous courage as a Catholic to stand up at Notre Dame and take on his church on abortion,"" Sheinkopf said. It was a voice that brought the parties to the table for a measured and substantial discussion on the issues, many of his contemporaries said. Rep. Charlie Rangel remembers that ""those of us in the legislature always have problems with the executive,"" but that Cuomo was still effective. ""What we're talking about here, though, is a man that had the intellect and ability to work with Democrats and Republicans and get the ball moving forward,"" Rangel said. When Cuomo campaigned in Tokasz's conservative upstate New York-district, where it was ""much more conservative,"" he said, Cuomo would still take up the debate on less popular issues. ""The governor was very good at articulating his position and using substantial arguments to support his position,"" he said. His death leaves one clear inheritor of his legacy, both ""literally and figuratively,"" Lowey said — Andrew Cuomo, his son who was sworn in to a second term as governor shortly before the elder Cuomo passed away. ""Andrew Cuomo, as governor, because of his pragmatism has been extraordinarily successful in actually putting in policies to implement Mario's vision,"" Lowey said. In some ways President Barack Obama, also known for his oratorical skills, is another inheritor of his legacy — but like Cuomo, Obama faced the same constraints of governing at a time of recession and austerity, in the face of an often unwilling and intractable legislature. RELATED: New York area Republicans praise liberal icon Cuomo . In others, the resurgence of the liberal left may have its roots in Cuomo's tenure as governor. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's unabashed commitment to liberal ideals against a skeptical city echoes in many ways the governor's commitment to criminal justice reform, civil rights and other . And Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another rising liberal star, may echo Cuomo in her fiery speeches on Wall Street and the middle class. But in many ways the conditions that created Cuomo, and made him such a valuable figure in liberal politics, have passed. Even then, Cuomo was aware that words can only go so far, and that Americans' patience for the careful phrasing and nuanced argument he was so apt at delivering had already begun to wear thin. ""I've learned that the only way to communicate successfully"" as a governor, he told a group of reporters during an exit interview with reporters, ""is simplicity and reiteration. Constant reiteration of simple ideas."" And he acknowledged, ""I have also decided I'm not capable of doing it."" Rangel said that today's often toxic atmosphere of partisanship makes it difficult for anyone to have the sort of conversation with the public that Cuomo revered and did so well. ""I don't think anyone could get out of the billions and trillions of dollars that have been poured in for [the parties] to negatively attack each other,"" he said. ""But if there's anyone that could do it, it would've been Mario Cuomo."" People we lost: 2014 .","Gov. Mario Cuomo's most lasting legacy remains his ""eloquent voice for the voiceless""

Shiomura had taken the stage to urge the Tokyo Metropolitan government to increase efforts to support women. Citing recent regulations that require mothers to fold up their strollers when boarding a train, she outlined struggles Japanese women face when dealing with pregnancy and raising a child due to lack of public support. She also addressed the issue of infertility. However, she was interrupted by a male member of the ruling LDP who shouted, ""You should get married!"" Shiomura smiled weakly and continued amid male laughter. A second outburst, ""Can't you even bear a child?"" followed as tears welled up in her eyes and her voice began to break. When she sat down after her speech, she was seen drying her eyes with a handkerchief. Later, she posted on Facebook that  the outbursts were like ""a punch in the gut"" and called on the hecklers to come forward. Backlash ensued, with television pundits debating the incident and women lawmakers demanding the names of those responsible be released. Sexism in common in the nation's workplace, and there have been concerns that Japan's fertility rate will continue to drop as more women choose careers instead of marriage and children. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has attempted to fill a gender gap in the workplace through ""Womenomics,"" but men still hold the majority of positions of authority and  command greater salaries. Men in Japan earn 30% more than their female counterparts, according to statistics cited by Abe during an editorial last year announcing the launch of ""Womenomics."" Statistics from the National Personnel Authority show just 3% of women are managers in Japan's central government, a number  the Prime Minister has said is too low. The goal is to increase that number to 30% by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Abe has said.","Male colleagues heckled  assemblywoman Ayaka Shiomura .

You eat your breakfast with a HAPIspoon, which monitors your food intake to ensure you don't eat too quickly. 7:30am: After breakfast, you go up to the bathroom to brush your teeth with a smart toothbrush, which assesses your brushing habits. Smart dental tools such as the Beam Brush send the results of your brushing directly to your smartphone. Tomorrow, you tell yourself, you will spend a few more minutes on your teeth and do a slightly better job. Sonny Vu, CEO of Misfit Wearables, says he is a committed Beam user, and that using a smart toothbrush ""helps me keep my dental premiums down."" 7:40am: You open your wardrobe to decide what to wear. You go past your Diffus UV dress, which measures how much sunlight you are exposed to, but as today is a cloudy day you aren't really worried about getting burnt. You also pass over your shark-proof wetsuit, which you wore on a recent holiday to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Finally, you settle on your Sensoree mood sweater, which, as you slip it over your head, emits a clear blue light to indicate that you are feeling calm and relaxed. In moments of stress the lights shifts to a vibrant mauve; when you are feeling angry it glows bright red. According to its creators, the mood sweater uses the same technology behind a classic lie detector test. Its sensors read your excitement levels and translate the data into a spectrum of colors.

The Hovding is worn as a collar and only expands into a full helmet if you have an accident. Syuzi Pakhchyan, a Fashion Technologist and wearable technology expert, says that ""the beauty of the Hovding is that the technology is invisible. It simply disappears in the pleats of the decorative fabric shell, protecting the wearer by allowing the technology to get out of the way."" 9am to 1pm: Throughout the day you connect to your Dekko-powered augmented reality device, which overlays your vision with a broad range of information and entertainment. While many of the products the US software company is proposing are currently still fairly conceptual, Dekko hopes to find ways to integrate an extra layer of visual information into every part of daily life. Dekko is one of the companies supplying software to Google Glass, the wearable computer that gives users information through a spectacle-like visual display. Matt Miesnieks, CEO of Dekko, says that he believes ""the power of wearables comes from connecting our senses to sensors."" Miesnieks says that in the future, software such as Dekko may allow people to ""'see inside' buildings as we walk past them. Connecting online services and the real-time data about people and locations to our sense of sight ... We'll be able to look at something and get a search result back telling us all about it (who's in there right now? Is there inventory in-stock? What's the history of the place?)."" 1pm: During your lunch break you go for a run wearing your latest high-tech sportswear. Designs such as miCoach training shirts, developed by US sportswear brand Adidas, track your performance and feed your results instantly to your smartphone. Qaizar Hassonjee, vice president of innovation at Adidas Wearable Sports Electronics, says: ""in the near future, I see this combination of apparel and smartphones working together seamlessly and making wearable tech ubiquitous and part of our daily lives."" Michael Durwin, a user experience consultant and Google Glass tester says that fitness has a large role to play in wearable technologies. ""If I were an exercising type -- which I'm definitely not -- I'd use something like Nike+ to track my running in the morning. Or if I really wanted to monitor my health I'd wear a FitBit Flex throughout the day, checking it around 6pm to see if I've burned off enough calories to justify a slice of cheesecake."" 6pm: After finishing up at work, you get back on your bike and ride home. Before you begin your ride, you tap on your Misfit Shine necklace. Before you start your ride, it displays 8 out of 12 dots, indicating that you are 65% of the way through your daily activity goal. After you arrive home you tap it again, and it shows 12 full dots -- you have reached your exercise target for the day. 6:30pm: When you arrive home, you quickly clean up your house with your Foki vacuum shoes, which gather dust as you walk. 7pm: You finish cleaning, jump in the shower and then change into your outfit for the evening. Tonight is not quite the right night for your Intimacy dress that goes transparent when you get excited. Instead you opt for your CuteCircuit K-Dress, which is powered by hundreds of LED lights embroidered onto a layer of fabric. Pakhchyan notes that ""with illuminated fashion, there is a fine line between gimmick and innovation, (but) Cute Circuit's K-dress is sophisticated yet playful."" Before you head out the door, you decide to switch off all your other wearable devices. Tonight is just about you, your partner and the night... Oh yeah, and a couple of hundred brightly flashing LED lights.","Two major conferences in the U.S. discuss the future of wearable technology .

"(CNN) -- It has been dubbed Russia's Las Vegas. A place where Vladimir Putin's government rolled the dice in a grand project to help the world rethink the way it does business. More than $50 billion has been spent in reshaping Sochi for the Winter Olympics, in the process bringing traffic gridlock, a decline in tourism and environmental destruction. If it's been tough for the locals, it has arguably been just as hard for the ex-pats who came to the Black Sea resort looking for a new life and are left wondering just what the legacy of this month's Games holds for them. One British businessman, who came to Russia in 1996, believes a huge opportunity has been missed by the authorities. ""What the Russians don't understand is the price of what they have. The natural resources here, the forests, the rivers -- there's so much untouched nature here it's just incredible,"" says James Larkin. ""You can walk in the mountains for several days and you won't see any houses, any roads, there's no way to get there except for walking. There's not really many places in the world left for that. That is a huge tourist attraction in itself."" Larkin started a ""banya"" spa retreat in the Krasnaya Polyana mountain region above the coastal city, but has spent the last year working in Moscow due to the chaos brought about by Sochi's reconstruction. ""The last few years it's been pretty bad, they've been digging up the roads, lots of traffic jams. The locals, who are tourists who'd come from Sochi, they've stopped coming completely. ""The prices have shot up ... economically it's made the whole thing very difficult."" For American businessman Bruce Talley, however, the influx of the thousands of people needed to turn Sochi into an Olympic venue has been a massive boon. Talley, who worked in investment banking before spotting opportunities for property investment in Russia, has found a niche helping Olympic officials, broadcasters and sponsors to navigate Russian bureaucracy. ""It's amazing. I lived in California for a long time and I watched the growth and development there, and of course southern California is a much bigger area ... In a concentrated region like this, I've never witnessed anything like the changes here,"" he told CNN. ""There have been a lot of people who have relocated here working for various bodies. We've done relocation for some of those companies, helping them find apartments all the way up to providing services, financial management and contracts."" In between these two perspectives lies Bastien Simonneau, who with his chef father runs a French seafood restaurant overlooking the harbor, a bakery and a catering business. ""I think after the Olympics it will be good because we will have good hotels, roads, a nice airport -- it will be very quick for people to come from Moscow to enjoy the snow,"" the 31-year-old told CNN. ""Right now, of course, you don't get tourists."" That was late last year, when Sochi's workforce was still battling towards its deadline of being ready for the February 7 opening ceremony. Since then, security has been stepped up even further after several terrorist alerts, resulting in a clampdown on traffic into the city. Sochi, which has a subtropical climate, has traditionally been the hub of the ""Russian Riviera"" -- a narrow 2 km belt of coast that stretches 145 km. It's a popular summer retreat for Russians, but there is some doubt as to how many foreign tourists will make the long trip for the Olympics despite the much-improved air and rail links. ""Before we were thinking yes, but right now we don't know,"" Simonneau says. ""The authorities, their priority is terrorists, to control everybody, so I don't know if we are going to have a lot of foreigners. You need to have documents for everything. We have a lot of questions about how it will work, but they don't answer us."" But there is no doubting the tourism potential of the massively-revamped Krasnaya Polyana mountain cluster, which Simonneau recalls had just one ski lift (""I think they bought it secondhand from Yugoslavia"") at the time of his first visit several months after Sochi was awarded the Games back in 2007. ""I really enjoyed the quality of snow but it took 40-45 minutes to get to the top of the mountain,"" he says. ""They only had one road. There was nothing in Krasnaya, a small village and nothing much, only Russian tourists."" Now there are three high-end resorts, much to the delight of Russia's ski-loving president Vladimir Putin, who has taken a hands-on approach in ensuring his grand project goes to plan. However, locals in Akshtyr village outside Sochi have complained about the effects all the building has had on their environment. Alexander Koropov told CNN a train line built 20 yards from his fruit farm has left the produce rotting on the vine due to pollution at the construction sites. ""Every 10 minutes, he says, the high-speed train whizzes past his house, and it drives him crazy,"" reports CNN's Ivan Watson, who says other residents told him the government had failed to fulfill promises to provide centralized plumbing and heating. ""Alexander says this was a beautiful place before the Olympics. You can't imagine how many trees were destroyed here to build this."" Sochi's organizers, however, say they have undertaken extensive replanting programs to replace hundreds of thousands of trees in affected areas in the city and surrounding regions. Areas for endangered plant and animal species have been created, according to the Sochi 2014 Environmental Strategy . The Mzymta river basin is also being restored, with millions of fish released into the waters, and Sochi's aim is a ""Zero Waste"" Games that have ""minimal impact on the climate"" in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, said the official policy statement. Larkin, though, despairs at the impact of development on what was previously a relatively unspoiled mountain region. ""Most of the Russians, especially the politicians, don't get it. For a bad copy of what you've got in Switzerland, made in a couple of years, you're not going to impress people,"" he says. President Putin's plan to enhance Russia's reputation as a major international player may have sacrificed some of the sprawling country's natural beauty but, some say, it is revitalizing a region that had fallen into neglect following the Soviet era. ""The Olympic torch is going to burn where I used to live,"" says Rima Seferyan, one of thousands of Sochi residents who had to relocate. ""I'm very happy with my new house."" Bruce Talley -- the American fixer -- is excited about the business opportunities that lie ahead for the city, which will host Russia's first Formula One race in October and will provide one of the venues for soccer's 2018 World Cup. ""Sochi is kind of being reborn,"" says the 54-year-old, who publishes what he says is the only English-language information source in the city. ""They will be having lots of events for a long time here. ""We had the economic forum going on, one of the few largest business forums in Russia -- there's one in St. Petersburg and one in Sochi each year. Tens of thousands of people come here to make contacts."" Russia, as Bastien Simonneau also acknowledges, is not an easy place to do business. Through his ventures, the restaurant owner says they have been helped by its people's love of French culture. ""The biggest challenge is to find someone you trust. The second thing is to find and train the staff,"" he says, adding that most of his workers come from other parts of the country. Spa owner Larkin says it might be even harder now for foreigners to set up business in Sochi. ""It's a question of the initial cost of it -- the price of land and construction materials has gone through the roof, it's more expensive than in Moscow,"" says the 58-year-old. ""The second problem is finding people. They have made all the foreigners move out, mainly people from countries like Tajikistan who've been doing work there. ""They've had to leave so it's more expensive to find people who can sink piles or lay bricks or things like that. Then you have all the other problems of getting your suppliers."" Despite the difficulties the Olympics have brought him, Larkin hopes international visitors will come to Sochi and experience life in Russia -- though they may have to escape the confines of the Olympic area to do so. ""I'm English but Russia is my home, I'm very fond of this country and the people here. They've got a lot of good things to offer,"" he says. ""The people are nice -- they're a bit harsh at first, a bit hostile but, inside, most of the Russians have a very warm heart and are quick to make friends with you. ""I've had situations where you've had a small car crash with somebody, they're shouting, swearing and getting angry -- after about 10 minutes they're inviting you home for dinner.""","Russia's first Winter Olympics has brought both opportunities and disruption .

"Iraqi Kurdish President Massoud Barzani is willing to participate in the formation of a new government in Baghdad, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday. On Monday, Barzani told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he would press the issue of Kurdish independence with Kerry when the U.S. official visited Irbil, saying, ""The Kurdish people should seize the opportunity now."" Kurds have complained that Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government has marginalized them, a feeling shared by Iraq's Sunni Arab minority. In his interview with CNN, Kerry said Iraqi leaders he has spoken with have ""realized they cannot continue with this sectarian division"" -- a realization that would presumably include a greater role for Kurds in governance. ""Words are cheap. I'm not taking anything I hear to the bank and saying, 'Wow, it's going to be solved,' "" he said. ""But I'm hearing things that indicate to me that if they follow through on the things they're saying, there's a capacity to have a new government that could be a unity government, that could reflect a greater capacity for success."" Iraq government claims gains in anti-militant fight . The United States has sent military advisers to counsel Iraqi commanders on how best to take the fight to militants trying to create an Islamic state in Syria and Iraq. U.S. officials also have promised what Kerry said Monday would be ""sustained"" and ""intense"" aid. President Barack Obama is also weighing military intervention short of combat troops. But forming a new Iraqi government is a crucial precursor to further U.S. intervention to stop the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, Kerry said. ""The key is, if you don't have a viable government, that is a unity government that is not going to repeat the mistakes of the last few years, whatever we might choose to do would be extraordinarily hampered,"" he said. Kerry said failing to come up with a new political structure would make it ""very difficult to be successful"" with a military intervention. Still, he noted, the President maintains the right to engage in such activity, with or without a political solution, if he decides that doing so is in the United States' interest. ""He reserves the right to use force if he has to,"" said Kerry, ""if it's going to accomplish a goal."" He denied that Obama's decision not to launch airstrikes against Syria -- where ISIS has gained much of its strength -- or delays in making a decision about what to do in Iraq have made the crisis worse. ""... You've got to have a holistic, comprehensive approach, and the President is trying to figure out, as we are, I am, whether or not Iraq is prepared to be part of that,"" he said. In the interview, Kerry defended Obama's decision not to go forward with military strikes in Syria. ""The reason that the decision to strike Syria didn't happen was because we ultimately came up with a better solution after the President made his decision to strike,"" Kerry said, referring to an agreement that required Bashar al-Assad's regime to give up its chemical weapons stockpile. On Monday, the organization tasked with monitoring the weapons removal said the Syrian government had turned over all of its declared chemical weapons. ""That's a very significant accomplishment,"" said Kerry. Political Chatter: The new Iraq debate .

"""What's more important, food or satellites?"" This isn't a question our smiling North Korean official was exactly prepared for. Suddenly, he wasn't smiling any more; a moment so carefully choreographed was in unscripted territory. ""Please will you answer the question,"" I persist. ""Isn't it more important to feed your people?"" The news briefing was over; our official turned and was ushered out of the room. This had been the day the notoriously secretive country was pulling back the veil on its planned rocket launch they say will put a small satellite into orbit. Defiant North Korea displays rocket . North Korea insists this is a peaceful launch, the satellite for scientific research. The United States and its allies are more dubious. To much of the world this country, still technically at war, is taking yet another step towards perfecting a long range missile that could strike American cities. ""I'm very disturbed by these claims,"" the head of the launch site says. Can you deny it is a missile? I ask. ""Look for yourself,"" he replies. ""Does it look like a missile to you? This is why we invited you here."" True, North Korea has taken an historic step. This is unprecedented access, bringing media from around the world to a highly sensitive site that had been hidden from view. As I step from our train, the launch pad and rocket are clearly visible nestled against a hill in the distance. Up close, we get the grand tour. Not only taken to the base of the rocket itself, but to the control center and the small satellite North Korea maintains will be fired into orbit. This is not the first time this reclusive nation has carried out such tests. There was a failed launch in 2006 and another slightly more successful in 2009. Still, analysts say along with its nuclear program, Pyongyang has continued refining its missile technology. A successful launch this time, warn international observers, would show that North Korea could deliver an object anywhere on the planet. After the death of the so-called Dear Leader, Kim Jong il, last December there were brief flickers of hope his son and successor Kim Jong Un, still under 30, may begin to reform the country. U.S envoys sat down with North Korean officials in Beijing in February and promptly announced a new food aid deal. But this launch has scuttled any optimism. Analysis: Solving the Pyongyang problem . As we make the five hour train journey to the launch site at Tongchang-ri, we get a rare glimpse through the window of a country long dubbed ""the hermit kingdom."" It is a barren landscape. People move slowly here. There is little sign of livestock, the odd cow, some goats, barely even a dog. In the distance figures can be seen chipping at the harsh ground in a land that doesn't offer up enough to keep the people fed. It takes no imagination to grasp the impact of decades of suffering on these people. Forged in war, they have endured devastating famine and the iron grip of now three generations of Kim family rule. This is what brings me to my original question. How can a country that has to go to the international community for food aid afford to spend so much on satellites, missiles or nukes? I won't get the answer to that here today. But to understand is to look to the soul of the country and its hardline military. In North Korea the army comes first. This regime's legitimacy doesn't rest on feeding people, its survival rests on an aura of invincibility; convincing its people it can repel any invader. Kim Jong Un's fate rests on the power of his arsenal, and like his father and grandfather before him, no price is too high.","North Korea says it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite this month .

"(CNN)Donna Douglas, who played voluptuous tomboy daughter Elly May Clampett on the 1960s TV series ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" has died. She was 81. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, TV station WAFB, a CNN affiliate, reported that Douglas died Friday morning. Douglas lived in Zachary, Louisiana. Her assistant, Jeffrey Dalrymple, confirmed her passing to CNN. Douglas spent nine years as Elly May, one of the main characters of the hugely popular ""Beverly Hillbillies."" The series concerned a poor Ozark family who stumbled upon an oil fortune and then moved to the Southern California bastion of wealth, where their rural ways often clashed with the local swells -- particularly Margaret Drysdale, the wife of the man who ran the bank where the Clampetts kept their money. The other characters were Elly May's subtly wise father, Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen); her feisty grandmother Daisy (Irene Ryan); and her cousin Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.), forever chasing women and fame. In some ways, Douglas -- who was born Dorothy Smith -- was a natural for the role. She was from a small town, Pride, Louisiana, and was a genuine tomboy. Her official website says she spent her childhood ""climbing trees, swinging on vines (and) playing football, basketball, and softball with her older brother and all her boy cousins."" She also loved animals, a character trait she indulged on the show. A beauty queen, she moved to New York in the late '50s and attracted attention as a model and for her appearances as Perry Como's ""Letters Girl."" She had some small roles in films and bigger ones on TV series, including a memorable ""Twilight Zone"" episode, ""Eye of the Beholder."" But it was ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" that made her a star. At its peak in the early '60s, the show was the most popular on television, drawing stratospheric ratings seldom equaled by episodic television, despite criticism from reviewers who disliked its broad humor. In fact, a number of 1964 episodes still rank among the most-watched TV shows (non-Super Bowl division) of all time. However, Douglas found it hard to break away from Elly May. Her only starring movie role was in ""Frankie and Johnny,"" a 1966 Elvis Presley vehicle. She and the King did become friendly, bonding over a shared interest in spiritual subjects, according to a website dedicated to Presley's female co-stars. Douglas worked sporadically after ""Hillbillies"" was canceled in 1971, with the Internet Movie Database listing roles in ""Night Gallery,"" ""Love, American Style"" and ""Adam-12,"" among others. But she mainly devoted herself to singing and personal appearances. However, she never regretted her claim to fame. ""Today the role of Elly May has been a beautiful opportunity, a wonderful little door opener for me to share my heart with others, whether speaking in churches, ladies conferences, youth groups, schools, conventions, and various civic organizations, or one on one,"" her website bio said. ""Amazing what God can do with a life, if given the opportunity!"" Douglas was married twice and is survived by a son, Danny Bourgeois. People we lost: 2014 .

"In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to well-placed leaks that have been showing up in various publications. The latest is a report from Bloomberg that says Apple already has a team of 100 employees working on a wearable device. The clues, and resulting flurry of speculation, are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. Apple dream-product rumors have mostly focused on an elusive Apple TV over the past year. But Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be way more than just a fancy timepiece. It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. An Apple watch could work with an ecosystem of third-party wearable sensors and products that tie into one powerful, small hub. If executed correctly, an Apple watch could spawn a lucrative industry of compatible products, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications. ""It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can tap into,"" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that alert the watch when you've eaten too much. Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of slick smart watches available, but most act as accessories, connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth. For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates. Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely. ""We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple's the real one, that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,"" said Munster. Apple isn't alone in seeing the potential for this type of technology. Google is working on its own wearable platform, Google Glasses. The two will face off when they are finally available, each sporting its own unique take on what kind of user interface people will use (voice control and a small touchscreen or augmented reality). And they will, of course, have their own ecosystems of accessories and apps. Traditional watches have dropped in popularity in recent years. Smartphones prominently display the time and are already in our back pockets, so it can seem redundant to also strap a small clock to our wrists. But when you start packing more power, sensors and connection options like Bluetooth into a watch, it ceases to be a watch and becomes a small wearable computer. An Apple watch could leap frog the current crop of smart watches by creating a platform, not another accessory. According to Munster, the three tasks people use their smartphones for are, in order, texting, Internet and phone calls. Two out of three of those tasks would be a natural fit for a small device, while the need to surf and play games would ensure the smartphone doesn't become obsolete.","An Apple watch could pass existing smart watches with more computing, sensor power .

"Those looking for greater happiness and satisfaction in life should head to northern Europe, but steer clear of Egypt and countries worst hit by the eurozone crisis, according to the 2013 World Happiness Report released Monday by Columbia University's Earth Institute. Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden are the world's happiest countries, according to the survey of 156 countries.  Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Benin and Togo -- all nations in Sub-Saharan Africa -- are the least satisfied with their lives, the report said. The United States came in at number 17 in the world in terms of overall happiness, but it still lags behind Canada (6), Australia (10), Israel (11) the United Arab Emirates (14) and Mexico (16), according to the Earth Institute. The report ranks the United Kingdom as the 22nd happiest country in the world. Other major nations included Germany (26), Japan (43), Russia (68) and China (93). Life's ups and downs . The global survey was conducted between 2010 and 2012 and follows the Earth Institute's first rankings released last year. While ""the world has become a slightly happier and more generous place over the past five years,"" economic and political upheavals have resulted in greatly reduced levels of well being for some nations, the report said. Rankings for Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain fell dramatically because of the impact of the eurozone crisis, while Egypt, Myanmar and Saudi Arabia registered large falls in the wake of recent political and civil turmoil. Egypt had the greatest fall in happiness levels. On a scale of 1 to 10 -- with 10 rated as happiest -- Egypt averaged 4.3 in 2012, compared to 5.4 in 2007. ""We expect, and find, that these losses are far greater than would follow simply from lower incomes,"" the report said, noting that the greatest single factor reducing happiness levels in these countries was a reduction in people's perceived ""freedom to make key life choices."" Angola, Zimbabwe and Albania experienced the largest increases across all the countries surveyed. ""On a regional basis, by far the largest gains in life evaluations in terms of the prevalence and size of the increases have been in Latin America and the Caribbean, and in Sub-Saharan Africa"", the report said. Reduced levels of corruption also contributed to the rise. Governments seeking to improve the happiness of their populations should spend a higher proportion of their health budgets on mental illness, which is the single biggest ""determinant of misery"" in countries assessed, the study authors said. ""People can be unhappy for many reasons -- from poverty to unemployment to family breakdown to physical illness,"" the report said. ""But in any particular society, chronic mental illness is a highly influential cause of misery. ""If we want a happier world, we need a completely new deal on mental health."" Gross National Happiness . The 2013 World Happiness Report comes on the back of a growing global movement calling for governments and policy makers to reduce their emphasis on achieving economic growth and focus on policies that can improve people's overall well-being. An idea first proposed in 1972 by Bhutan's former King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the concept of ""happiness economics"" has now gained traction in many countries across the world, including the UK, Germany and South Korea. The UN first encouraged member countries to measure and use the happiness of their people to guide public policies in July 2011. ""It is important to balance economic measures of societal progress with measures of subjective well-being to ensure that economic progress leads to broad improvements across life domains, not just greater economic capacity,"" the report said.","Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden are the world's happiest countries .

"Chances are you're reading this while leaning over a table or slumped back in a chair. Your head is tilted forward; your shoulders are curved. If you're on a mobile device, your arms are bent by your side and your back hunch is even more profound. Am I right? The position you're in is probably causing you pain, whether you're aware of it yet or not. Don't worry, physical therapists have a diagnosis for the headaches, neck cricks and achy shoulders. They call it ""Text Neck."" ""Text Neck is not just a texting problem,"" says Dr. Dean Fishman. ""Text neck is a gaming problem. Text neck is an e-mailing problem."" Fishman originally coined the term in 2008 while examining a 17-year-old patient. The teen came in complaining of headaches and neck pain. As Fishman was trying to explain to the patient's mother exactly what the problem was, he glanced over and saw her posture. The teen was sitting in a chair, hunched over her smartphone, texting away. ""I knew I had something,"" Fishman says. The average human head weighs 10 pounds in a neutral position -- when your ears are over your shoulders. For every inch you tilt your head forward, the pressure on your spine doubles. So if you're looking at a smartphone in your lap, your neck is holding up what feels like 20 or 30 pounds. Sleeping with your smartphone? All that extra pressure puts a strain on your spine and can pull it out of alignment. Dr. Tom DiAngelis, president of the American Physical Therapy Association's Private Practice Section, compares it to bending your finger back all the way and holding it there for an hour. ""As you stretch the tissue for a long period of time, it gets sore, it gets inflamed,"" DiAngelis says. ""The real question ... is 'What are the long term effects going to be?' "" Staying in what experts call the ""forward head posture"" can lead to muscle strain, disc herniations and pinched nerves. Over time, it can even flatten or reverse the natural curve of your neck. As your mother used to say: Be careful or it might stay like that. Dr. Michelle Collie, director of Performance Physical Therapy in Rhode Island, says she started seeing patients with head, neck and back pain caused by mobile devices six or seven years ago. Recently she says Text Neck has increased dramatically, especially among her younger patients. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 8- to 18-year-olds spend an average of seven and a half hours using ""entertainment media"" every day. But it's not just kids. The average amount of data used on a smartphone tripled from 2010 to 2011, according to Cisco's Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update. And each tablet generates 3.4 times more traffic than the average smartphone. Not only does forward head posture cause nerve pain, Collie says it can also create metabolic problems. Try to take a deep breath in a slumped position. Now sit up straight and try again. Experts say slouching can reduce the capacity of your lungs by as much as 30%. A lack of oxygenated blood flowing through the body can potentially lead to vascular disease. And gastrointestinal problems can be caused by pressure placed on the organs in a bad posture. So what's an iPad-cradling, smartphone-texting, laptop-loving guy or gal to do? First, Collie says, is to be aware of your body. Keep your feet flat on the floor, roll your shoulders back and keep your ears directly over them so your head isn't tilted forward. Use a docking station and wrist guards to support the weight of a mobile device. Buy a headset. Fishman's Text Neck Institute created a mobile app to help you remember to avoid forward head posture. When your Android phone (the app is not yet available on iTunes) is held at a safe viewing angle, a green light shines in the top left corner. When you're at risk for Text Neck, a red light appears. Optional vibrations or beeps can be added as a warning. Most important, the physical therapists agree, is taking frequent breaks while using any mobile device or desktop computer. About every 20 minutes, stand up, roll your shoulders and neck or go for a short walk to improve blood flow. When you return, check out more stories in Our Mobile Society series.

"(CNN)You can't get a new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus until Friday, but iOS 8, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, went live on Wednesday. The free download is available to anyone with an iPhone 4S, 5, 5C or 5S. IOS 8 isn't the radical upgrade that iOS 7 was, but it has a handful of new features that you're bound to enjoy. Here's a look at a few of our favorites. (Is there another feature you're looking forward to using? Let us know in the comments.) Device Continuity . When Apple's Mac operating system, OS X Yosemite, is released, probably in late October, it will pair with iOS 8 for the tightest integration ever between devices. Users will be able to do things like answer phone calls on their laptop, receive texts on a desktop computer and move a document in progress from an iPhone to an iPad to a computer with a single swipe. iOS 8: How to get it, and whether you should . That feature, called Handoff, works with apps including Mail, Safari, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Maps, Messages, Reminders, Calendar and Contacts. Widgets . Until now, Apple has kept strict controls on how apps -- other than its own -- appear on the iPhone and iPad. Basically, they get a tiny, uniformly sized box for each app, and that's that. But in iOS 8, it has given developers the ability to create widgets for the devices. Now, they'll be able to create simple, standalone tools for things like checking the weather or monitoring data usage. But the function, which has long been available on Android devices, will be limited to the ""Today"" screen under the device's Notification Center. Keyboard changes . Apple says iOS 8 brings the biggest changes to the system's keyboard since the iPhone was introduced. For one, Apple will begin allowing third-party typing apps, so tools like Swype, the finger-dragging system popular on Android, will be coming soon. The system's native typing system will get some tweaks too, largely in the form of QuickType, a Google-style predictive text system. The system will predict the next word you want to type based on what you've written in the past and let you add the entire word with a single tap. Its predictions will change based on the people you're communicating with and the format you're using (say, email vs. text). What's that song? Siri is now integrated with Shazam, an app that recognizes music and other media playing around it. iOS 8 users will be able to simply ask Siri ""what song is playing?"" and get everyone's favorite digital assistant's best guess. Family Sharing . Apple wants you to have one big happy iPhone and iPad-using family. In the new system, up to six people will be able to share purchases from iTunes, iBook and the App Store without having to share a single account. Family Sharing also automatically creates a family photo album, letting anyone on the plan share to it. There's a shared family calendar so anyone (OK, let's face it, so Mom ...) can keep everyone abreast of plans and an ""ask to buy"" function that automatically pings parents, letting them give or withhold permission when a child tries to buy something from Apple.

"In the weeks before every Valentine's Day, Rosie Maizuss wields enormous power, like a modern-day Cupid able to influence millions of romances -- depending on whether she detects just the slightest thing amiss. Maizuss is a federal inspector lording over the arrival of millions of roses and other flowers from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, intended for delivery to couples in the United States. Her job is monumental: she and other U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspectors are now in one of their two busiest season of year -- Mother's Day is the other one -- at the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego. In the span of six weeks, she and her crew will have sniffed, touched, reviewed and inspected shipments of cut stem flowers whose final count is expected to total more 19 million by Valentine's Day on Friday. ""We know that we are going to have an influx of fresh flowers, but we have a special operation to focus on more inspection"" during the holiday madness, Maizuss said. As dizzying as that number is, the U.S.-Mexico border crossing at Otay Mesa, California, is hardly the nation's busiest port for Valentine floral inspections. That title goes to Miami, where during last year's Valentine season, officials processed a whopping 738.2 million cut flower stems shipped in from Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and elsewhere. Otay Mesa ranked No. 3 among the nation's busiest ports in processing Valentine flowers last year and No. 6 for finding plant pests in shipments. A total of 59 little critters were found last year. For anyone who enjoys expressions of the heart, the Otay Mesa crossing is a snapshot -- or a metaphor for Cupid's arrow in flight? -- of how the delivery of Valentine Day's roses can be a long and difficult journey. It's not unlike, well, true love itself. What makes Maizuss' job so important is that she must keep the bad flowers from possibly causing catastrophic damage to American soil. To do so, she and her colleagues ensure the flowers are free of disease, insects and microscopic pests that, if they found their way on U.S. land, could wipe out swaths of American agricultural and floral industries. ""What we do is we take a random sample out of each variety of flowers, and we do our inspection in either in an edit bay inside, or out on the dock,"" Maizuss explained at the border crossing, where motorist traffic is routinely backed up for an hour or more. ""What we are looking for is any variety of pest,"" she added. ""The ones that are reportable are the ones we already have here in the States, and the ones that are actionable are the ones that we actually don't want in the States at all, because they are invasive, because they are a big problem for the U.S. ""Cut flowers is a huge industry, and it's very important we protect it all the time,"" said Maizuss, who's chief agriculture specialist. Last year, inspectors found a total of 1,715 pests in Valentine flowers at all ports of entry, federal figures shows. The most common insects intercepted were aphids, thrips, moths, miner flies and mites. Such vigilance can mean headaches for the truckers who waited in standstill traffic at the busy U.S.-Mexico border -- only to be forced to turn around if they don't pass Maizuss' inspection. ""I remember a few times they had sent me back,"" trucker Samuel Serrano said. That meant he had to return to Maneadero, Mexico, near Ensenada, where he unloaded the flowers and had them fumigated to kill the bugs, he said. He eventually passed U.S. inspection on a subsequent trip across the border, he said. It's a necessary protection that Mexican truckers such as Jesus Sanchez Lopez understand -- though they feel the deadline pressure from U.S. markets to deliver the roses, dianthus, sunflowers and larkspur by February 14. ""When our flowers are not clean, they send us back to Mexico, and we have to clean them, take them down from the truck, and then come back,"" said Sanchez, who has endured such failure to pass inspection several times. Some rejections have resulted in a total loss for that shipment, he said. Sanchez also delivers flowers from Ensenada, located about 70 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. ""When that happens we lose money, time, and it's a huge problem because we have to go back and can't deliver the flowers,"" he added. ""You really don't know until you get here and they tell you that some of your flowers are infested."" Despite such setbacks, the demand for love remains insatiable, the truckers say. ""The last two weeks have been very busy because of the celebration of Valentine's Day,"" Serrano said.","Rosie Maizuss and crew review 19 million Valentine flowers at U.S.-Mexico border .

"Talk about an overwhelming response. The much-anticipated launch of a new collaborative line between Italian designer Missoni and Target caused the retailer's website to crash several times Tuesday. ""Target.com is seeing greater item demand than we do on a typical Black Friday, and the excitement for this limited-time designer collection is unprecedented,"" the store said in a statement. ""We are slowly bringing the site back online to ensure we can provide a positive shopping experience to our guests."" By Wednesday, the site was back up and running, but many of the colorful, zigzag designs were out of stock. Between 7:47 and 8 a.m. ET Tuesday, the Target.com homepage was completely down with a connection timeout error, according to AlertSite, a Web performance monitoring business. For most of Tuesday afternoon and evening, the homepage displayed a courtesy page of the Target dog letting visitors know the site was overloaded. ""We are suddenly extremely popular,"" the page said. The fervor wasn't only online. At stores nationwide, customers eager to grab up the colorful zigzag designs began lining up hours before opening. Stores reported selling out of stock within hours as shoppers grabbed up clothing and housewares at deeply discounted prices. A full-priced knit scarf by the iconic Italian designer runs from $175 to $200 at department stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. The Missoni for Target collection includes knit dresses and sweaters between $40 and $60. On the pricier side, a women's bike costs $399.99 and a 28-inch piece of roller luggage, $199.99 . The reaction comes amid considerable  buzz leading up to the public debut of the collaboration. A private launch event September 7 in New York's Times Square was described in media reports as a ""madhouse"" with celebs such as Emma Roberts, Camilla Belle and Rachel Zoe in attendance. Actress Jessica Alba tweeted that she ""dreamt about the Missoni 4 Target bike last night"" and that she hoped her husband was ""going to get it 4 me?!?"" Singer Jessica Simpson retweeted Alba, saying that she wanted the bike, too: ""So cute!"" Target has collaborated with other designers before, from Isaac Mizrahi to Jean Paul Gaultier, but none to this effect. The collection was scheduled to be available from Tuesday through October 22 at Target stores and Target.com. It was unclear how Tuesday's activity would affect future sales.","Target.com up and running after periodic outages Tuesday amid launch of Missoni line .

"The Chicago Board of Education voted Wednesday to close 50 schools, a controversial move that drew sharp criticism from the city's teachers union. The vote comes two months after officials announced plans to shutter the schools. The closures ""will consolidate underutilized schools and programs to provide students with the quality, 21st century education they need to succeed in the classroom,"" Chicago Public Schools said in a statement Wednesday. The Chicago Teachers Union opposed the closures, which it said would disproportionately affect African-American students. ""Today is a day of mourning for the children of Chicago. Their education has been hijacked by an unrepresentative, unelected corporate school board, acting at the behest of a mayor who has no vision for improving the education of our children,"" said Karen Lewis, the union's president. ""Closing schools is not an education plan. It is a scorched earth policy."" In a written statement, Lewis said district officials had manufactured ""the underutilization crisis,"" and that shuttering the schools will not save a significant amount of money. The union also had warned that the move would expose students to gang violence and turf wars, an apparent reference to neighborhood loyalties. The union went on strike last year. The city's nearly 30,000 teachers walked out on September 10, objecting to a longer school day, evaluations tied to student performance and job losses from school closings. With school districts across the country dealing with financial shortfalls and pressures to make reforms, the strike quickly gained national attention. It pitted the teachers union against Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who spoke in support of the school closings in March. ""This decision has been delayed for a decade, and it's our children and our city that have paid the price for inaction,"" he said. ""Consolidating schools is the best way to make sure all of our city's students get the resources they need to succeed in the classroom."" CPS currently has 403,000 students, with seats for more than 511,000, and close to 140 of its 681 schools are more than half empty, according to the district.","Union leader: ""Closing schools is not an education plan.

"Indonesia has long fought a losing battle against commuters who stubbornly ride on train roofs to beat the rush hour. But railway officials say they have found the perfect deterrent, concrete balls, suspended on chains from a steel frame, just 25 cm or 10 inches, above any passing train. Dubbed ""Goal Balls"", they are about 10 cm or 4 inches in diameter and are painted silver. Twenty four, a dozen on each side, are suspended from a frame that looks like a soccer goal. The first one was installed early this week, a few hundred yards from a train station, just outside Jakarta. Anyone riding on the roof will find it hard to dodge the balls. Mateta Rizahulhaq, a spokesman for the state-owned railway company PT Kereta Api, told CNN no one has dared an attempt it. ""From our field reports so far, there have been no roof riders on that line since we installed them,"" Rizahulhaq said. Over the years, officials have tried and failed to stop commuters from climbing atop carriages. ""Policing passengers has been going on in various ways for so long. Starting with oil on the roof, using barbed wire, spraying dyed water, dogs, advice from religious leaders. None of these were effective,"" explained Rizahulhaq. Some critics say this latest tactic seemed too extreme. ""It's not that we do not have humanity, but from the time someone gets up on the top of the train, they just do not value their life anymore,"" Rizahulhaq added. Almost half a million commuters depend on the railway system to travel within the greater Jakarta area. Trains are packed, especially during the rush hours. Many passengers choose to climb to the top of overcrowded carriages. There are some -- train surfers -- who get on for a free ride or just for the thrill of it. Officials say these thrill rides cause one or two deaths per month. They hope the new measure will prevent any more fatal accidents. If the concrete balls prove to be effective, more will be installed in other areas of the capital, officials said. The government predicts that by 2018, the number of train passengers in Jakarta will increase to over a million. Everyone here agrees that what this growing metropolis needs is an improved and expanded railway system that gives passengers no excuse to get on train rooftops.","The concrete balls are suspended just above the passing trains .

"""Thar he blows!"" In a scene straight out of Moby Dick, a rare white whale is back and putting on a show for his fans off the eastern coast of Australia this week. First spotted on Tuesday, the albino humpback has been nicknamed ""Migaloo"" by researchers who track his movements. On Thursday he was seen swimming along Sydney's coast on his annual migration. This is the third year in a row he's been spotted. Albino whales are rare and Migaloo is one of only a small handful of documented all-white humpback adults, according to Oskar Peterson, who runs a website that tracks sightings of white whales around the globe. ""We have photos of a junior Migaloo from a few years ago, but we haven't seen him since so we don't know if he survived the South Ocean,"" said Peterson. ""But there is a 100% white whale we've seen photographic proof of in Norway, so Migaloo isn't quite as unique as we once thought."" Migaloo was first seen in 1991 when he was a juvenile and researchers believe he is now in his 20s. He doesn't show up every year, but his journey is part of the humpbacks' annual migration from the Antarctic to their breeding grounds along the Great Barrier Reef. ""The helicopter crews are all out photographing him today,"" said Oskar Peterson. ""He's giving us all quite a parade this year."" Migaloo passed by Cronulla in Sydney's south on Thursday afternoon and would soon be seen by whale watchers at Bondi Beach, Peterson said. Spotters of the whale are sharing sightings, photos and video at his Twitter account, Migaloo1. Male humpbacks can travel up to 140 kilometers (87 miles) a day during their migration, according to experts. Researchers warn fans to steer clear -- at least 500 meters away at all times -- to ensure the whale's survival. Too much noise and chasing can disturb him and cause him to use precious energy he needs for migration. But whale watchers may be able to enjoy Migaloo for decades. Humpback whales are believed to survive as long as 90 years in the wild. Rare goblin shark wasn't the only thing that surfaced . What devoured this great white shark?

"London (CNN) -- The European Union is spending more than $167 million to soothe the pain being felt by fruit and vegetable farmers hit by Russian food sanctions. The move comes as the trade war between the West and Russia intensifies, and looks likely to hit Europe's growth figures. Fears over the impact of chilling relations has already undermined Europe's fragile recovery. Around $2.7 billion worth of fruit and vegetables were shipped from the EU to Russia in 2013, the bloc's single biggest export to the market. The package announced by the EU Monday will support producers of fruit and vegetables that are already in season and can't be easily stored. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a tit for tat move against Western sanctions, banned imported European cheese, American chicken and Norwegian seafood from the country's dinner tables. The move was in response to countries imposing economic sanctions against Russia in the aftermath of the flight MH17 disaster. The Kremlin banned most agriculture products from the U.S., the European Union, Norway, Canada and Australia. Europe's food exports to Russia were worth $15.8 billion in 2013, making up around 10% of the bloc's agriculture exports, according to EU data. European countries sold $1.6 billion worth of pork and $1.3 billion worth of cheese and curd to Russia. The U.S. shipped $1.3 billion worth of food to Russia, with chicken and other poultry making up a quarter of the total value, around $310 million. The ban of foreign food is more than just an inconvenience for Russians who like imported food. Russia is the world's fifth largest agricultural importer and remains dependent on food supply from abroad -- its agricultural trade deficit extended to $26 billion in 2013, according to data from the European Commission. With billions worth of food disappearing from the market, prices are likely to go up and experts forecast increased Russian inflation, which is already running at 7.5%. Russians will still be able to enjoy European wines and spirits, as well as bread, pasta and cereals. These have escaped the embargo -- even though their ban would hurt Europe economically. In 2013, EU countries sold nearly $1 billion worth of spirits and $733 million worth of wine to Russia. Explore CNN's infographic above to see what items are likely to disappear from Russian menu.

"In suspense, a nation listened to the Ukrainian President's inaugural speech Saturday, hoping for answers to the question: Will there be peace? ""I don't want war. I don't want revenge,"" Petro Poroshenko said after taking the oath of office. But then his talk turned tough. He promised to meet anyone challenging Ukraine's territorial integrity with military might. Alluding to a Biblical verse he said, ""Who comes with the sword will fall from the sword."" The statement was met with enthusiastic applause. The country will build the means to do so, Poroshenko said, and re-arming the Ukrainian army must be a priority. ""No one will protect us, if we do not learn to protect ourselves."" He called for separatists in Ukraine's east who have taken up arms against the government to lay them down and offered amnesty to those who ""do not have blood on their hands."" Poroshenko also called for corridors to open to allow fighters who have joined pro-Russia separatist forces from outside the country to leave Ukraine. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin ordered border guards to stop the illegal crossings of people from Ukraine by beefing up security, the state-run ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Meanwhile, in Donetsk on Saturday, an assistant to Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Republic, was killed in an attack in broad daylight, a CNN crew at the scene said. Attackers shot at the car that Maksim Petruhin was in, and when he exited the vehicle, he was shot and killed. It was the most brazen attack in Donetsk since the unrest began. Heading West . Poroshenko, one of the world's richest men and an experienced politician, took the oath of office in the country's parliament Saturday. He was presented with the symbols of high office -- a presidential badge, a seal and a mace -- before taking to the podium for his inaugural address. His opening remarks left little doubt over the tenor of his speech, as he praised the activists of the Maidan, whose rebellion in the center of Kiev led to the ouster of his predecessor in office, Viktor Yanukovych. The pro-Russia former President sparked rage from Ukrainians who wanted the country to join the European Union  when he nixed an agreement with the EU in favor of closer ties to Moscow. Ensuing street battles resulted in the deaths of dozens. Poroshenko condemned the former pro-Russia government as a ""dictatorship."" ""The people stood up,"" he said, declaring his country's new direction toward the West. Before at least four European Presidents and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, the man who became a billionaire as a chocolate maker vowed to quickly continue Ukraine's move toward the EU, calling Ukraine's path to Europe ""irreversible."" Ukraine's natural place is with Europe, he said, adding that he's prepared to sign an economic partnership agreement with the European Union as soon as its officials approve it. The agreement is just one step toward Ukraine becoming a member of the European Union. Poroshenko received a standing ovation for the remark. Ukrainians have reason to look forward to a brighter future, he said. ""We are being supported by the whole world."" Armed conflict . But the new President inherits a country with a burgeoning armed conflict in its east. Violence there is taking lives daily, and government troops and rebel fighters are beefing up their might. The names of the cities Donetsk and Luhansk have transformed into monikers for flashpoints of tension between Russia and the West as the government in Kiev breaks its ties with Moscow to embrace Europe and the United States. But ethnic Russian separatists in the east and south yearn to stay with Moscow. The Kremlin, holding fast to centuries-old ties, is said to be helping them dig in their heels after annexing the region of Crimea, which before 1954 was part of Russia. Poroshenko addressed the move directly. The territorial integrity of Ukraine is not up for discussion, he said, and he has taken an oath to uphold it. ""I will stand by this oath no matter what,"" he said. He promised to visit Luhansk and Donetsk and maintain respect for the Russian language, commonly spoken in Ukraine's east and south. The government will be decentralized, giving those regions more say in their own affairs, he said. ""New powers will be allocated to regional powers,"" Poroshenko said. But there will be no federalization, as many separatists have demanded. Some analysts believe such a move would help cement Russia's influence in their regions. Ukraine will be one unified country, the President said. Meeting Putin . Security prospects have seemed elusive, but on Friday, a ray of hope pierced the ominous clouds between Moscow and Kiev during D-Day celebrations in France, where Putin came together with Western leaders to honor common sacrifices made to defeat fascism in World War II. Putin came face-to-face with Poroshenko. Afterward, Poroshenko announced that negotiations between the two sides would begin Sunday, his second day in office. But in his address on Saturday, he spoke of the meeting with Putin in more assertive language. ""Yesterday I made a firm statement about it to the Russian leadership in Normandy,"" he said. ""Crimea was, is and will be Ukrainian soil."" Poroshenko sets out Ukraine's European destiny, warns adversaries . 'It's hell down there': Inside the battle for eastern Ukraine .

"A California family's nanny nightmare may be nearing an end. More than three weeks ago the Bracamonte family fired Diane Stretton, 64, but she refused to leave their home. Police told the family they couldn't force Stretton out of their Upland, California, home without an eviction notice. A judge even ruled in Stretton's favor, deciding the Bracamonte's did not terminate Stretton's employment in a legal manner. The family said Stretton then threatened to sue them if they tried to force her out. Now Stretton has offered to move out, according to ABC News, but under her conditions. Stretton called the family's attorney late Saturday night ""and said she could be out by July 4,"" Marcella Bracamonte said on ""Good Morning America"" Sunday. But Bracamonte said that won't work for her family because they plan to be out of town. So it's still unclear at this point if, in fact, the nanny will leave of her own free will or whether the family will have to continue through with the eviction process, now underway, before they can call their home their own again. ""This is now by court, by law, this is her domain, "" Ralph Bracamonte told ABC News. The family's saga started in March when Marcella Bracamonte hired Stretton as a nanny, who was expected to help out with household chores. The family ran a background check on the woman before hiring her, too. Bracamonte fired her on June 6. ""She quit working about a month before I ever fired her. She would just stay in her room,"" said Marcella Bracamonte. CNN discovered that Stretton is on the California's Vexatious Litigant List, a list of people who continually bring legal action, regardless of merit, against others with the sole intention of harassment. CNN found dozens of lawsuits filed by Stretton in California over the years.","Media report says nanny offered to leave by July 4 .

"House Republican leadership is standing by Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 3-ranking House Republican, in the wake of a firestorm of criticism surrounding his 2002 speech to a white supremacist group. Scalise's position as House majority whip has been thrown into doubt by the revelation, and the congressman had been calling members to gauge the level of support he had from his party, according to a senior House Republican source. But House Speaker John Boehner, in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon, said Scalise has his ""full confidence"" as whip. ""More than a decade ago, Representative Scalise made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate.  Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I know Steve to be a man of high integrity and good character.  He has my full confidence as our Whip, and he will continue to do great and important work for all Americans,"" he said. His message came shortly before a similar message of support from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The controversy surrounding Scalise's address to a group founded by former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke had become a major distraction for Boehner and his leadership team since the story drew national attention on Monday. The fallout: What you need to know . In a statement issued Tuesday, Scalise said he spoke to the group while he was barnstorming the district to build support for a piece of legislation — and that speaking to them was a ""mistake I regret."" ""One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn. It was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold,"" he said in the statement. ""I am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain,"" he added, and decried the group's ""hateful bigotry."" The statement did not address how much Scalise knew about the group at the time of the speech. Duke himself has said he doesn't know Scalise. Duke's former campaign manager, who said he organized the event, also said the congressman likely wasn't aware of the controversial history of his group. However, a Roll Call report from 1999 suggests Scalise knew Duke well, and was critical of his beliefs. At that time, both were considered potential contenders in a House special election, and Scalise panned him in comments to the paper. ""The novelty of David Duke has worn off,"" Scalise said. ""The voters in this district are smart enough to realize that they need to get behind someone who not only believes in the issues they care about, but also can get elected. Duke has proven that he can't get elected, and that's the first and most important thing."" In a coordinated move Tuesday,  Boehner and McCarthy issued statements supporting Scalise within minutes of Scalise's new statement. There was frustration, according to the aides, that Scalise's initial statement, in which he blamed sloppy staff work for his appearance before the group in 2002, made it appear he wasn't taking full responsibility for the incident and moving to get it passed him. It is unclear at this point how much blowback Scalise will get from rank-and-file Republicans, and that might now be fully visible until lawmakers return to work next week after digesting the unfolding situation. While the only public expressions from Republicans to this point have been supportive, the aides predicted Scalise still needs to work hard in the days ahead to maintain the confidence of his colleagues. Critics of Scalise have been bipartisan, but so have his defenders. He's received strong support from Louisiana politicians, with African-American Rep. Cedric Richmond — the state's only Democratic House member — defending him from charges of racism. ""I don't think Steve Scalise has a racist bone in his body,"" Richmond told the New Orleans Times-Picayune. ""Steve and I have worked on issues that benefit poor people, black people, white people, Jewish people. I know his character."" But national Democrats have pounced on the episode, and as Boehner remained silent on the issue for most of Tuesday, ramped pressure on House Republican leadership to weigh in . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said the news of Scalise's speech is ""deeply troubling"" for a GOP leader, but also declared that ""actions [of the House GOP caucus] speak louder than whatever"" Scalise said during the forum. ""Just this year, House Republicans have refused to restore the Voting Rights Act or pass comprehensive immigration reform, and leading Republican members are now actively supporting in the federal courts efforts by another known extremist group, the American Center for Law and Justice, which is seeking to overturn the President's immigration executive actions,"" he said in a statement. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee issued a scathing statement charging Scalise ""chose to cheerlead for a group of KKK members and neo-Nazis at a white supremacist rally"" and slamming House leadership for their silence on the development. ""While David Duke defends Scalise, Speaker Boehner and Leader [Kevin] McCarthy are refusing to condemn Scalise's choice of allies,"" said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee National Press Secretary Josh Schwerin. Schwerin said the incident made it ""clear their leadership has a history of embracing anti-Semitic, racist hate groups."" According to an agenda for the event and notes attendees posted afterward, Scalise appeared at the National/International EURO Workshop on Civil Rights, a white nationalist organization founded by David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The appearance was first reported on Sunday on CenLamar.com, a Louisiana politics blog run by Lamar White Jr. But Scalise vehemently disavowed the group's beliefs in his interview with the Times-Picayune, and said he ""spoke to any group that called"" — comparing it, as an example, to the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group known for helping to register new voters. ""When you look at the kind of things they stand for, I detest these kinds of views. As a Catholic, I think some of the things they profess target people like me. At lot of their views run contradictory to the way I run my life,"" Scalise added. Scalise also suggested the appearance was in part due to staffing issues. ""I had one person that was working for me. When someone called and asked me to speak, I would go. I was, in no way, affiliated with that group or the other groups I was talking to."" CNN has learned that the staffer at the time was Cameron Henry, who currently holds Scalise's former state House seat. Henry rushed CNN off the phone Monday night and declined to discuss the situation, but did not deny his work for the congressman. Henry's brother, Charles Henry, is Scalise's current chief of staff. Neither responded to requests for comment on Tuesday. The controversy comes just days before Republicans take full control of Congress with House Majority Whip Scalise poised to play a key role in shepherding through conservatives' legislative priorities. But even conservatives have expressed frustration with Scalise, who they believe hasn't stood strong on their priorities — pointing most recently to his vote for the government funding measure that drew heavy opposition from conservatives because it didn't address President Obama's immigration executive action. Some, however, expressed support for him Tuesday. Rob Maness, the former Louisiana Senate candidate backed by the Tea Party, has been named as a potential primary challenger to Scalise but backed him in a statement to CNN. ""As Congressman Scalise has already conceded - attending this event was a mistake.  I think we are all currently taking him at his word that this was an isolated incident that happened some 12 years ago,"" Maness said. He added that if that's true, ""this is clearly an orchestrated attack designed to distract"" from the real issues, including ""fighting back against President Obama's executive amnesty, correcting a weak and feckless Foreign Policy and stopping the massive expansion of government growth and spending."" More broadly, however, the establishment silence has infuriated conservatives still smarting over their loss in the Mississippi Senate race, when their chosen candidate, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, was narrowly defeated by Sen. Thad Cochran after establishment Republicans lodged racially-charged attacks against him. McDaniel came under heavy fire from establishment Republicans for being billed as a headliner for a rally alongside a white nationalist, though he never ultimately attended the rally. In an email to CNN, McDaniel said that ""of course there is a double standard for the GOP establishment."" He noted that former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour ""has a long history of despicable comments, some of them overtly racist,"" pointing to a Politico article outlining some of the more salacious. ""And yet, he receives a free pass from establishment politicians because of his perceived influence.  All the while, others are forever tarnished for less serious deeds,"" McDaniel said. He added: ""The establishment wings of both parties are more hypocritical than fair, seeking to crush anyone -- friend and foe alike -- who would threaten their hold on power."" Politicians in Scalise's home state of Louisiana rallied to his defense on Monday, however, saying they don't believe he agrees with the white supremacist group's ideology. ""I know Congressman Scalise to be a good man who is fair-minded and kindhearted. I'm confident he absolutely rejects racism in all its forms,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a statement. But Scalise's alleged appearance at the event drew a harsh rebuke from Erick Erickson, the conservative RedState.com blogger and former Louisiana resident who asked of the congressman: ""How do you not know? How do you not investigate?"" ""How the hell does somebody show up at a David Duke organized event in 2002 and claim ignorance?"" Erickson wrote in a post Monday. He said Trent Lott -- the former Senate majority leader who was driven from his post after praising Strom Thurmond's 1948 segregationist presidential campaign -- lost his gig ""for something less than this"" in 2001. And he pointed to Republicans who hit Mississippi Senate candidate Chris McDaniel in 2014 for attending events hosted by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and for making plans to attend a rally where he was billed along with a white nationalist.","House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders say they'll stand by Steve Scalise .

"Reggie Hilaire was a rookie cop on September 11, 2001. He worked at ground zero for 11 days beside his colleagues -- many of them, including Hilaire, not wearing a mask. He was later assigned to a landfill in Staten Island, where debris from the World Trade Center was dumped. For about 60 days between 2001 and 2002, the New York police officer was surrounded by dust. In 2005, Hilaire was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He underwent surgery and radiation. Just months later his doctor told him he also had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that multiplies the body's plasma cells to dangerous levels. It's a cancer that usually strikes much later in life. Hilaire was 34. More than 1,100 people who worked or lived near the World Trade Center on 9/11 have been diagnosed with cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A few months ago Hilaire received a letter from the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, officially offering him medical insurance under the World Trade Center Health Program. About 1,140 people have been certified to receive cancer treatment under the WTC Health Program, a representative told CNN. These are the first numbers released since the program was expanded a year ago. In September 2012, federal health authorities added 58 types of cancer to the list of covered illnesses for people who were exposed to toxins at the site of the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Dr. John Howard, administrator of the WTC Health Program, had said the year before that cancer treatments would not be covered by the compensation fund. At the time, he said there was inadequate ""published scientific and medical findings"" to link 9/11 exposures to cancer. 9/11 responders wait for compensation for illnesses . Others argued that hundreds of chemical compounds, among them known carcinogens, were present in the dust surrounding ground zero. Potential cancer-causing agents such as asbestos that coated the World Trade Center buildings' lower columns, and benzene, a component of jet fuel that caused uncontrollable fires when planes barreled into the twin towers, have long been a cancer concern for researchers. Scientists were also worried about the high volume of particulates and gases inhaled by responders, survivors and people who lived in the area. Yet some officials were worried about making the connection between 9/11 and cancer too soon. When the proposal to add cancer coverage was made, experts estimated the cost would total between $14.5 million and $33 million. And while someone's cancer may have been caused by his or her work at ground zero, it might also have been a coincidence -- they may have gotten cancer anyway. A long lag time makes it particularly difficult to study the link. Cancer doesn't develop quickly after breathing in something toxic, the way asthma might. Instead, leukemia can take five to six years to develop, and solid tumors can take 10 to 20 years. Compensation comes too late for one man . In the end, it was a study of firefighters that helped persuade the government to include cancer in the WTC Health Program. Researchers found firefighters who worked at ground zero were 19% more likely to develop cancer than firefighters who did not. According to the 2011 study, published in The Lancet medical journal, the increase occurred during the first seven years after 9/11. There were subtle increases seen in a few cancers in particular, including gastro-esophageal cancers and blood cancers such as multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. One theory about how the cancers may have developed so soon among responders is that the unique characteristics of ground zero dust, and the sheer number of chemicals contained in it, may have accelerated disease. The WTC Health Program will act as a backup insurance for Hilaire, whose primary insurance through the city has been taking care of his medical expenses. Doctors aren't treating his multiple myeloma now; it's asymptomatic, so they're simply watching it. But when it does start to cause problems -- and it will, his doctors say -- they'll begin a treatment program. For Hilaire, receiving the WTC Health Program welcome letter was more about recognition than assistance. ""They looked over my medical records ... determined cause and effect,"" he said. ""After years saying, 'We don't know, we're not sure,' they finally said, 'Yeah, you got it from there.' "" And Hilaire knows the program will be a big help to those who don't have good health insurance -- folks who lived or worked in the area who have since been diagnosed. He said he thinks the number of people who have, or who will get, cancer related to 9/11 is a lot higher than 1,140, something only time will tell. The WTC Health Program was created as a result of the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. The Zadroga Act, passed by Congress in December 2010, is designed to provide medical services and compensation for responders who were exposed to toxins while working at ground zero. President Barack Obama signed the $4.2 billion legislation in January 2011. The law is named after a New York police officer who died of a respiratory disease attributed to working amid the toxic chemicals at the attack site. First responders, volunteers, survivors of the attacks and residents near the 9/11 site who meet specific qualifications are eligible for coverage, according to the CDC. The program has also been recently expanded to include responders from the Pentagon attack and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed. People are still enrolling from those locations so the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health does not have an accurate count of how many people were affected, a representative told CNN.

"Authorities investigating this week's deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood said Friday that an altercation between Spc. Ivan Lopez and his fellow soldiers, rather than a medical condition, may have led to Lopez opening fire. ""The immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area,"" Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commanding general, told reporters. Some of the soldiers involved in the altercation were victims in the shooting, according to Chris Grey, spokesman for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, who appeared with Milley at a news conference on the sprawling post. Officials would not release further details about the argument, saying the investigation was still ongoing into what caused the 34-year-old to set out on a shooting spree that left three soldiers dead and 16 wounded before he killed himself. But the sister of one of the soldiers injured in the attack said that prior to the shooting Lopez stopped by the base's personnel office to pick up a form requesting leave -- or military permission to be away for a time. Armetra Otis, sister of Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, said on CNN's ""The Lead"" that her brother ""was at work and a guy came in and asked for a leave form."" The soldier was told he would have to come back later, Otis said, . ""And apparently I guess he didn't want to hear that, so he came back and just opened fire, "" Otis said. ""He shot the first guy he saw and killed him and then turned the gun on my brother and he was shot four times,"" she said. Sgt. Westbrook was released from a hospital Friday, his sister said. Both Milley and Grey said they did not know if the leave issue in itself led to the altercation. ""At this time, we have not established a concrete motive,"" Grey said. Investigators have not uncovered any history of criminal convictions or previous criminal activity by Lopez, nor have they found any links to terrorism. On Thursday Milley said investigators believed a medical history that indicates an unstable psychiatric or psychological condition may be a ""fundamental causal factor,"" in the shooting. But on Friday he said investigators ""do not believe"" that his ""underlying medical conditions ... are the direct precipitating factor"" The shooting blindsided victims, said Dr. Matthew Davis, medical director of trauma services at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple. ""It was a shocking episode. It felt very surreal,"" he said after speaking to victims. ""It was a very unexpected thing in the middle of a working day."" Governor, senator visit . Texas Gov. Rick Perry and the state's junior U.S. senator visited with some of the wounded Friday. Speaking to reporters at Fort Hood afterward, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz hailed the bravery of wounded survivors. He recalled the story of one soldier, shot in the abdomen, who called 911 and ""stepped forward"" to save others. Acknowledging the post has seen two mass shootings since 2009, Perry said there were no easy answers to what happened Wednesday, but that soldiers there will ""recover from this latest tragedy."" ""We'll learn lessons about what occurred here and minimize the chances of this ever happening again,"" Perry said. Perry and Cruz declined to answer questions about whether soldiers should be able to carry concealed weapons on base. Right now, Perry said, the focus should be on those who were wounded or killed Wednesday. The conditions of three victims, who were previously listed as critical, have been upgraded to fair, Scott & White Memorial Hospital posted on Twitter on Friday morning. Five have been discharged from the hospital. Of the four remaining Friday morning, one was expected to go home later in the day, the hospital said. Milley announced Friday afternoon that the three soldiers killed will be remembered in a memorial service at the post next Wednesday, exactly one week after the attack. The rampage . The shooting started about 4 p.m. Wednesday when Lopez walked into an administration building at the base and opened fire with his .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol. He then got into a car, fired from the vehicle, got out of the car, walked into another nearby administration building and fired again. One of the locations was the medical brigade, the other the transportation battalion. Lopez was assigned to the 13th Sustainment Command, which deals with logistics. In his work, he had regular dealings with the transportation battalion. But authorities have ""no indication at this time"" that Lopez was targeting specific soldiers when he opened fire on the Army post, Milley said. The base, which has more than 45,000 soldiers and nearly 9,000 civilian employees, went on lockdown after the shooting began. A short time later, a military police officer came face to face with Lopez. Both he and she drew their weapons, Milley said. Lopez put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, ending his life. At Lopez's apartment, his wife was watching news reports about the spree, worrying about her husband, from whom she had not heard all afternoon, said neighbor Xanderia Morris, who tried to console her. But Lopez's wife had no idea that he was the shooter until a local TV station identified the dead gunman. His widow became ""hysterical"" when she heard the news, Morris said. Officers picked up Lopez's widow at their apartment near the base in Killeen, and she was cooperating with law enforcement, an FBI official told CNN. Depression, anxiety . Lopez hailed from Puerto Rico, where he served in the National Guard from 1999 until 2010 before moving to the U.S. Army. He had two deployments as an infantryman, including a four-month stint in Iraq in 2011 as a truck driver, Milley said. Before coming to Fort Hood in February, Lopez served at Fort Bliss in Texas. He, his wife and their daughter moved into an apartment a little more than a week before the shooting. They appeared to be a normal couple, smiling ""whenever they'd see someone,"" Morris said. But behind Lopez's smile lay a history of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, Milley told reporters. The soldier was receiving treatment and taking antidepressants, he said. Army records don't show him as having been wounded in Iraq, but Lopez reported that he had suffered a traumatic brain injury, Milley said. The shooter ""had a clean record"" behaviorally, Army Secretary John McHugh said. And he gave no sign during a psychiatric exam last month that he was likely to become violent. Lopez had also been prescribed the sedative Ambien, McHugh said. Investigators who searched his home have found no significant physical evidence, such as a suicide note, to indicate motive, a law enforcement official told CNN on Friday on the condition of anonymity. The official also said that Lopez purchased a ""large amount"" of ammunition when he bought a .45-caliber gun on March 1, and continued to buy more ammunition throughout March. U.S. law enforcement officials previously said Lopez bought his gun at Guns Galore, a store in Killeen. The casualties . All those killed in the shooting were military personnel, Milley said. Sgt. Timothy Owens was one them, his family said in a prepared statement. ""He was a very outgoing person and enjoyed Taekwondo,"" the statement said. ""He loved his job in the Army and was going to make it a career."" Owens, 37, was a counselor in the Army and had served in Iraq. His mother, Mary Muntean, told CNN affiliate WICS-TV in Springfield, Illinois: ""He was a good person. Why would they shoot a good person that was helping them?"" Owens loved the military and planned to make it his career, his mother told the station. ""He didn't answer the phone so I left a message on his phone: 'Son, call me so I know if you're OK or not.' Well, never got no call from him. I thought: 'Oh God, please don't let it be,'"" his mother said. Also killed was Staff Sgt. Carlos A. Lazaney-Rodriguez of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, according to his aunt, Benny Rodriguez. Lazaney-Rodriguez, 38, planned to retire from the military soon after serving 20 years, Aguadilla Mayor Carlos Mendez told CNN en Español's Mayra Cuevas. ""It was a very close-knit family,"" Mendez said ""Excellent, decent, very good people. I know his family and his parents. They are good people."" Sgt. 1st Class Danny Ferguson also was killed, his fiancée, Kristen Haley, told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV in Tampa, Florida. Ferguson died trying to hold a door shut to stop the shooter, Haley, also a soldier, told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV in Tampa, Florida. ""He held that door shut because it wouldn't lock. It seems the doors would be bullet proof, but apparently they're not,"" Haley told the station. ""If he wasn't the one standing there holding those doors closed, that shooter would have been able to get through and shoot everyone else."" Haley said Ferguson was a native of Mulberry, Florida, and an outstanding athlete at Mulberry High, where he graduated in 1993. The small town is about 30 miles east of Tampa. One or two wounded victims may face long-term disabilities, but doctors are working to prevent this, said Davis, the Scott & White Memorial Hospital medical director of trauma services. Not again . When he first heard about the shooting, Davis says one thought ran through his mind: ""How can this possibly happen again?"" Less than five years ago, the hospital where Davis works treated casualties after Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 32 more in a November 2009 shooting  at Fort Hood. Hasan was convicted of 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder, and a military jury recommended in August that he be put to death. The former military psychiatrist told a court he was on a terrorist mission to protect leading members of the Taliban.","An ""escalating argument"" may have led to shooting, officials say .

"New York (CNN) -- It is fear that drives Dale Henderson down into the subways, lugging his large case. ""I caught some fear from some other musicians that classical music is dying and in 100 years there will be no more classical music. I can't believe that's true. I mean, it scares me to my soul if it were true."" So he sits with his cello on a New York subway platform and plays Bach as a sort of CPR to keep his style of music alive. Henderson has played cello since the age of 5, making his professional debut at age 13 with the Buffalo Philharmonic and earning a degree from the New England Conservatory of Music. When he first moved to New York in 2008, he played for tip money that he needed to survive. He now supports himself by teaching cello and playing at recitals and solo performances. Henderson stopped accepting tips in 2009 and began focusing on Bach Solo Cello Suites. His website says he chose them because their ""power and beauty unfailingly inspire great appreciation, joy and deep emotion in those who hear them."" ""From the first time I ever started Bach in the Subways, I had a sense of conviction of the value of what I'm doing,"" he said. ""I think that Bach in the Subways is providing something meaningful to the people who hear it."" Some commuters immerse themselves in the harmonic sounds as they pull out their cameras to record the experience, and others just stare, as if they are captivated by the ambience. Postcards propped on his silver music stand read, ""I do not take donations."" ""I don't collect donations while I play, because on the most simple level, it pollutes the experience for myself and everyone listening,"" he said. ""I think the most obvious answer to the question why am I doing this without collecting money on my own time is that I love it,"" he said. ""The interest is growing, so I think it's working."" Some listeners take a postcard from the music stand to learn more about Henderson and his music. ""The most memorable, satisfying moments happen when there's a group of people listening to me and connecting with the music, and it creates this other space -- this other realm that we can all come together in. And that's an incredible thing ... that's the magic of music.""","Dale Henderson gives cello concerts in New York subway stations .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Protesters threw bricks and bottles Friday at police outside a mosque in London after about 1,000 people showed up to counter a planned a right-wing demonstration there, police said. Police arrest a protestor in Harrow, London, after fighting broke out at a planned right-wing demonstration. One person was arrested ""to prevent a breach of the peace,"" police said in a statement. The right-wing demonstration's organizer, Stop Islamisation of Europe (SIOE), said on its Web site one of the demonstration's planners had been arrested. Seven other people were arrested during the melee for possession of ""offensive weapons"" -- including bottles of bleach, a hammer and a chisel, police said. Police said incidents at the scene began when the crowd -- believed to be either members of an anti-fascism group or there to provide support to the Harrow Central Mosque -- went after three youths, ""caught up with them, and assaulted them,"" police said. ""Police had to intervene to prevent the crowd from continuing with their attack."" It was not immediately known if the youths were affiliated with any political group. Police said they had identified and stopped a number of people believed to be heading to the right-wing protest prior to the demonstration's start time, preventing them from reaching the area. It was not immediately known how many, if any, of the group's supporters had successfully arrived outside the mosque. ""One person was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace as police believed if the SIOE demonstration started it would have resulted in serious disorder,"" police said. The group said on its Web site that the demonstration had been called off and that Stephen Gash, listed as one of the group's contacts, had been arrested ""to prevent a breach of the peace."" ""If you are on your way to the demo, don't go, it's being called off right now,"" the post read. ""The police can't handle the muslim counter demonstrators [sic]."" The group describes itself on its Web site as an alliance of people ""with the single aim of preventing Islam becoming a dominant political force in Europe.""

"Tahiti were handed a harsh introduction to the Confederations Cup as African champions Nigeria inflicted a 6-1 defeat on the minnows Monday. But the team from the South Pacific at least had the consolation of scoring a memorable first goal in a senior FIFA competition to the delight of the crowd in the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte. Trailing 3-0 in the 54th minute, a corner was met by Jonathan Tehau, who headed home emphatically. It was no more than Tahiti deserved for a spirited display and they celebrated in trademark style by forming a circle and pretending to use canoe paddles. But 15 minutes later, Tehau, one of three brothers in the squad, then undid his heroics by turning Nigeria's fourth past his own goalkeeper. Nnamdi Oduamadi went on to complete his hat-trick for the Super Eagles and Uwa Echiejile grabbed his second to complete the rout, but even at the final whistle all the plaudits were for Tahiti and they went of a lap of honor. The tiny nation of less than 200,000 people had qualified for the Confederations Cup by winning the Oceania Nations Cup, beating the might of New Caledonia in the final after favorites New Zealand had exited at the semifinal stage. Boasting only one full time professional, few had given them much of a chance against Nigeria, who have a population of over 160 million and have a clutch of players from leading European clubs. Tahiti coach Eddy Etaeta and his players showed visible signs of emotion as their national anthem was played -- each of them with flowers around their neck -- a national custom. Nigeria had arrived late on Sunday for the competition, reportedly as a result of a dispute of bonus payments, and despite the scoreline, would have left coach Stephen Keshi with some concerns. Tahiti immediately took the game to them, but Nigeria went ahead after just five minutes due to a huge slice of fortune as Echiejile's shot took a big deflection off Nicolas Vallar before finding its way into the net. Oduamadi scored two more before halftime, but at the other end Tahiti also had opportunities. Tehau's goal was undoubtedly the highlight but the 138th ranked team in the world will have their work cut out with further Group B fixtures against world champions Spain and Copa America winners Uruguay. Etaeta told the official FIFA website that his team's first appearance on the international stage had been a dream come true. ""I was deeply moved, almost crying. We watch World Cups on TV. Today we were actors. Tahiti was watching. Our president sent us a message and suspended a cabinet meeting for it."" Spain won their opener against Uruguay 2-1 Sunday and play Tahiti Thursday in the Maracana Stadium in Rio. Uruguay and Nigeria also meet then in a match likely to decide second spot in the group. Keshi knows they will need to improve on their display in the opener. ""It was a little bit difficult to up our game,"" he told AFP. ""When you know you're playing against, with all due respect, the Tahiti  team, you think everything's easy. They showed us that they can play football.  Congratulations to them."" Brazil, Mexico, Japan and Italy make up Group A of a tournament which is contested every four years by the winners of FIFA's six confederations, plus the hosts and the reigning World Cup champions.","Nigeria beat Tahiti 6-1 in Group B opener at Confederations Cup .

"Six-year-old Jayden David violently shakes on the ground, his blue eyes vacant and then filled with searing pain.  The video shows an unvarnished look at a seizure, something Jayden once experienced routinely. Not anymore, says his father, thanks to medical marijuana. Before he started taking a liquid, nonpsychoactive form of marijuana, Jayden couldn't walk, eat solid food or take a bath. He has Dravet's syndrome, a rare and catastrophic form of childhood epilepsy. It has triggered seizures so frequent that 44 times he has been rushed to the hospital in an ambulance, his distraught father by his side. Jayden's doctors prescribed 22 anti-seizure pills a day, which controlled the seizures but left him immobilized due to the side effects. ""He's in pain and suffering and crying,"" said Jayden's father, Jason David. ""You can't help him no matter what. What are you supposed to do? You have to do whatever it takes to save their life."" Last year, he had enough. Delirious with fatigue and emotional pain, Jason David called his mother to say he wanted to put a gun to his head, just to end the heartbreak of seeing his son suffer. His mother convinced him to not give up. David turned to something he had seen on television: medical marijuana. On June 4, 2011, David gave his son marijuana.  For the first time since Jayden was 4 months old, the boy went through an entire day without a seizure. ""Instead of medical marijuana, this is miracle marijuana,"" said David, holding up a jam jar full of liquefied and cooled cannabis. Jayden is not just walking, he's running. He plays at a park, climbing up and down the steps of the jungle gym. He swims at his local pool, splashing in the water with his father and other children. He loves to go to Fuddruckers to dig into his favorite food, a cheeseburger with mushrooms. His father has begun to wean him off the powerful pharmaceutical pills, which he believes have kept his son from developing properly. Children and medical marijuana . The liquid, nonpsychoactive form of marijuana that Jayden takes ensures the boy doesn't get ""high."" In a laboratory, the marijuana is distilled down to mostly cannabidiols, which advocates say is the potent medicinal value of the drug. Harborside Health Center, a medical marijuana clinic in Oakland, California, helped create the original tincture Jayden took. The center still analyzes and tests the marijuana before David administers it to his son. Harborside says it helps a number of child patients, including Jayden, whose parents legally obtain the marijuana. ""Parents don't want to bring their children to something controversial like cannabis,"" says Harborside's executive director, Steven DeAngelo. ""They do it reluctantly, and they do it because they're at their wit's end."" Eighteen states have legalized marijuana for medicinal uses or limited personal use. California, which has the nation's largest number of registered users, does not keep demographic data on its registrants. But Colorado has 45 registered users under age 18, Oregon reports 56 child users and Montana has 55. DeAngelo says children with severe autism, epilepsy, ADHD and cancer can be helped by medicinal marijuana. But those sick children, says DeAngelo, often face barriers to accessing marijuana. ""What I worry about are the thousands and thousands of children like Jayden who are suffering unnecessarily, who I know we could help,"" he says. ""The only thing separating them from help are outdated rules that need to be changed."" Those rules are at the federal level, where marijuana remains illegal. Highs and lows of using marijuana . Dr. Seth Ammerman, a pediatrician and specialist in adolescent substance addiction, acknowledges anecdotal reports like Jayden's remarkable turnaround. But he warns that a parent is ""flying by the seat of his or her pants"" when it comes to treating  children with marijuana. ""I do think there's potential for these cannabinoids to be medically relevant, but at this time we don't know the risks,"" says Ammerman. Because marijuana is illegal at the federal level, the government hasn't conducted any thorough research on the possible medicinal benefits. Ammerman is in favor of federal testing, but without it, he says marijuana is too risky to administer to children. ""We don't know if these treatments are going to work for every given child, or every given adolescent. There may well be serious side effects."" David says he'd pit his son's progress on medical marijuana against any pharmaceutical drug that currently treats Dravet's syndrome. What drives him, he says, is the hope that his boy will one day say, ""I love you,"" something David says a thousand times a day to his son. While we're present, Jayden says something close to ""I love you."" His father's face lights up. ""That's all I want to hear,"" says David. He hugs his son.

"Stephen Colbert plays a dangerous game. He walks a tightrope every night, and it's amazing that he doesn't fall on a regular basis. He tells jokes about race, gender, class and people love him or hate him. Does everyone get a joke? No. But of course he does say, in persona, amazingly offensive things sometimes. Last week things went south, and Twitter exploded in calls to #CancelColbert. The offense? A 140-character long foot-in-the-mouth that came from the Twitter feed @ColbertReport. The tweet was a joke that played off of a show segment that mocked an attempt by the owner of the Washington Redskins to make peace with the Native American community without having to change the team's name. ""I'm willing to show the #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever."" Race, meet satire.  But it didn't work. The controversial tweet, it turns out, was not written by Colbert himself, or from anyone on his show. But it was a Comedy Central account that presumably had license from the show's producers to publicize and magnify Colbert's voice. But instead of repudiating the tweet, Colbert on Monday night made further jokes about how the incident almost silenced ""my message of core conservative principles mixed with youth-friendly product placement."" Following the lead of Asian-American activist Suey Park, some have been demanding that ""The Colbert Report"" be canceled. These words perpetuate hateful stereotypes and bring up a history of very public repression and personal shame. To use them now is to call forth that history. And in calling it forth, these words create more racism. Defenders say he's a ""satirist"" in the best Swiftian mold. He has a license to say such things, for he speaks in the name of truth and justice. They're saying that the tweet wasn't from him (even though they were his words). And they're saying that these words were perhaps taken out of context. Colbert's responses on Monday night were uninspiring. The whole show was devoted to it, but it was the cold opening that people will remember: Colbert imagined a dystopian post-Report world. Think hell ... er Manhattan ... freezing over, before prominent Chinese-American actor B.D. Wong saves the day by explaining to him that it's all been a bad dream! This is still ""The Colbert Report."" #CancelColbert has failed. I wasn't disappointed because I think the show should be canceled. It shouldn't. But I was hoping for something more sincere, perhaps even an apology or a sit-down with Ms. Park to let her issues be aired. (On the show, he made no mention of whether he tried to invite her to appear). Instead, he invited Twitter co-founder Biz Stone for a mock apology to Colbert himself, and -- offering a tepid ""I never want this to happen again""-- shut down the Twitter account, @colbertreport. Many of Colbert's defenders have been asking why Park and her followers should get to decide what Colbert can and cannot say? Who cares what they think? Colbert should care what they think. Park and her followers represent a point of view that Colbert takes himself to be speaking for, liberals, racial minorities, the underprivileged. As a privileged white male, Colbert (just like the character he plays) gets his license to use what would otherwise be outrageous language because of his associations to those communities themselves. Colbert, his defenders will say, is a liberal with a history of fighting for the underprivileged. True. But white satirization of racial politics is conditioned on the blessing of the underprivileged themselves. This is why Colbert, in persona, sometimes cites the existence of a ""black friend"" and why Jon Stewart regularly discusses issues of race with his ""Senior Black Correspondent."" They know that it is precisely the underprivileged themselves that get to determine what should be done with the words that have been used to repress and embarrass them. Colbert, out of persona, should know that. Without an apology, what we have here is a case of a white liberal comedian trying to have his cake and eat it too. He's saying: ""I have license to say hateful things because everyone knows I don't mean them or because I have an Asian friend."" But the way he should show he doesn't mean them is by being sensitive to how his saying them affects others. If Park and the broader community are offended, he can't hide behind his liberalism. Liberalism is a license that comes with responsibilities that Colbert ought to abide by. ""The Colbert Report"" was never in any danger of being canceled over this. But whether or not he ever recognizes it, Colbert owes Park, as well as the broader Asian community, an apology. At the very least he should consider dropping the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong character.","A controversial tweet from @colbertreport raised a firestorm over racial satire .

"It's normally the domain of loose change and missing remotes, but after what one couple discovered in the sofa, you might think twice about sticking your hands down below the cushions. A Long Island couple found a 3-foot python underneath a couch cushion Monday, according to the Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The apartment, located in Holbrook, had recently been vacated and the couple was moving in, SPCA spokesman Roy Gross said. He was not certain when the previous tenant left it, but the snake appeared healthy and was not dehydrated. ""You can imagine how shocking it was,"" he said of the unexpected housewarming gift. ""You're not expecting to find a snake there."" SPCA officials took the snake, which they determined to be a ball python. A ball python is a nonvenomous python species found in Africa that can grow up to 3-5 feet long. ""They are generally a very docile snake,"" Gross said.

"Video propaganda showing the White House and Congress being blown up. Talk of hitting U.S. bases in the Pacific. The renunciation of a 60-year-old armistice that has kept the tenuous peace on the Korean Peninsula. It seems barely a day passes without another North Korean threat, and coming after the December launch of a long-range rocket and a third nuclear test in February, the florid declarations from Pyongyang have gotten the attention of the United States and its allies. More: North Korea touts its human rights credentials . So why now, and how nervous should you be? Here are five things to consider. It's an inside game ... Numerous analysts on both sides of the Pacific attribute the aggressive posture is part of an attempt by North Korea's young leader Kim Jong Un to consolidate his power in the reclusive communist state founded by his grandfather. ""First and foremost, it's for his domestic audience,"" said Jasper Kim, founder of the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group in Seoul, South Korea. ""Because without the support of the military, he won't be around for much longer. And so he has to bolster his support with the brass."" That's a tough sell for North Korea, ""where age matters,"" he added. Kim is believed to be 29. More: Kim Jong Un's life . Peter Hayes, director of the San Francisco-based Nautilus Institute, says there's also a debate going on inside the North Korean leadership about the country's future as a nuclear state. One side wants ""to be a nuclear-armed state that is able to behave like the recognized, legal nuclear weapons states and play their game and turn the tables on them,"" Hayes said. ""That is, in my view, what is going on in the test and the rocket firing,"" he said. ""The other policy current is associated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the international faction of the Korean Worker's Party, which is to negotiate our way out of this mess."" A recent statement from the foreign ministry declared that North Korea would not give up its nuclear ""sacred sword"" as long as the United States remains hostile -- a conditional statement that signals Pyongyang may be willing to give up the bomb under the right circumstances, Hayes said. Analysis: What's Kim Jong Un up to? ... But the talk is bigger this time . ""They say a lot of these kind of things, so there's a tendency to treat it as the kind of stream of crazy you get from North Korea,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, East Asia director at the California-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. ""But this is not normal. It is more vitriolic."" A recent statement by a top North Korean general specifically talked of hitting Washington with a nuclear weapon in the event of war. ""That's a pretty direct threat,"" Lewis said. More: Timeline of North Korea's threats . The North Korean rhetoric ramped up after the February 12 nuclear test and the U.N. sanctions that followed. Meanwhile, Victor Cha, director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University and former director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that North Korea has carried out some sort of military provocation within 14 weeks of every South Korean presidential inauguration since 1992. South Korean President Park Geun-hye took office on February 25, ""so start the clock,"" he said. ""What is not normal is that the backdrop for this is about a year of very unpredictable behavior by a new leadership, and a sequence of provocations that is more concentrated over a period of time than we have seen in the last 20 years,"" he said. ""So in that context, although to the average listener these threats may seem like it's just the North Koreans firing their mouths off again, for those of us that look at this more closely this is a little bit different -- and more concerning."" Their nukes aren't useful ... yet . Most observers say Pyongyang is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile. While its scientists managed to lob a small satellite into space in December, putting a working device atop a missile, launching it and hitting a target with it is vastly more complicated, Hayes said. More: Nuclear weapons: Who has what . But Lewis, who also runs the Arms Control Wonk blog, said the North Koreans may have tried to ""skip a step"" with its early bomb tests and build one small enough to fit on a missile. That might explain why its first two were relatively unsuccessful. ""I think it's plausible to think that they have a warhead design in which they are confident that's under 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) -- still not as small as you need to put on a missile and launch it to the U.S., but closer than they were a couple of years ago,"" he said. And while Washington hasn't come out and said it, Lewis said the March 15 announcement that the Pentagon will deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast may signal that the North Koreans have deployed a long-range missile they put on display at a parade in 2012. Lewis said the announcement was ""mostly for show,"" but could reflect real U.S. concerns about those missiles. ""If you're going to spend $1 billion to deploy interceptors, they ought to come right out and say it,"" he said. But nukes aren't everything . North Korea also has plenty of conventional military firepower, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles, as well as thousands of cannons, rocket launchers and tanks massed across the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South. Seoul is within range of many of those weapons, and the North has threatened before to turn the southern capital into a ""sea of fire."" A North Korean bombardment could kill tens of thousands of people in Seoul before South Korean and U.S. retaliation could smash those guns, Hayes said. But that would essentially launch a new Korean War -- one he said would end badly for the long-impoverished North. ""They have less than 30 days of fuel and no ability to refuel,"" he said. ""They've got to fight a very short war before they're just walking to where they're going to fight."" Pyongyang keeps its forces massed on the DMZ ""precisely because they're weak,"" he said. There are other avenues. When computers at South Korean banks and broadcasters began to crash on Wednesday, suspicion initially fell on the North. South Korea has accused the North of similar hacking attacks before, including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that also targeted banks and media organizations. Adam Segal, a cybersecurity expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, said the hacking is consistent with previous North Korean actions. Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . So now what? For years, Pyongyang has made deals to curtail its nuclear and missile work in exchange for economic aid. Those deals have fallen apart when the North went on to conduct other tests. The six-party talks among the North, its Asian neighbors and the United States fizzled in 2007, and the North's first attempt at a satellite launch scotched a previous U.S. plan to trade hundreds of thousands of tons of food for a halt to weapons work. ""I think the problem right now is that you cannot engage them directly after they have done a series of ballistic missile and nuclear tests, and we are going into a period of sanctions now through the U.N. Security Council resolution,"" Cha said. ""They don't want to give up their nuclear weapons. They want to be able to have their cake and eat it, too. And U.S. policy for the past quarter-century has been these things are all on the table if you are willing to give up your nuclear weapons,"" he said. ""And so this is the problem. This is the dilemma right now."" Meanwhile, the United States is going ahead with joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises amid the North Korean threats, adding a special little twist -- overflights by massive B-52 bombers. It's a move reminiscent of the worst days of the Cold War, and one Hayes called ""tactically smart but strategically stupid."" ""The North Koreans will have noted it for what it is -- an affirmation of the fact that we're playing the nuclear game with North Korea, and that's the last thing we want to do,"" he said. ""I think our posture is either to persuade ourselves that we're hanging tough, which is a domestic game in Washington, or to reassure our allies and dissuade South Korea from going it alone with nuclear weapons."" But both Hayes and Lewis said there's little to lose by continuing to engage the North. ""We do what we can on defense, and if the North Koreans want to bargain or haggle, I'm prepared to do that,"" Lewis said. READ MORE: 5 ways North Korea is getting stranger .

"Some 1,348 people have been executed by the state since 1976, when the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume after a four-year moratorium. Twenty-eight were given lethal injection this year, three over the past several days. While the annual number of executions and death sentences continue to drop nationwide, it remains a legally and socially acceptable form of justice for aggravated murder in 32 states. But a new book reveals how the high court four decades ago was on the verge of eliminating the death penalty permanently. Evan Mandery's ""A Wild Justice: The Death and Resurrection of Capital Punishment in America"" (Norton) is a stunning insider's look at the legal and social forces dividing the justices during turbulent times. For two centuries death by hanging, firing squad, gas chamber, electrocution, and toxic chemicals (among nearly a dozen methods) was completely ingrained in the American political fabric. But Mandery chronicles one justice's quiet, improbable crusade to change the legal landscape beginning in the early 1960s, in the process conflicting the court like few issues before or since. Money and politics court's first big case this term . His narrative crests with Furman v. Georgia (1972), when the court struck down that state's capital laws, and effectively putting executions on hold. The 5-4 decision produced nine separate opinions,  and no controlling precedent. It was a collection of 60,000 words (the longest in the court's history) that gave only temporary optimism to death penalty opponents. Church and state, executive power on Supreme Court docket . States then made changes to their laws, and the court four years later (on the eve of the nation's Bicentennial), reversed itself in stunning fashion. CNN spoke recently to Mandery, a former capital defense lawyer, and now a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. CNN:  Your story begins with Justice Arthur Goldberg, who wanted the Supreme Court to test whether capital punishment itself was fundamentally unconstitutional. Mandery: ""It just shows how utterly remarkable what Goldberg did. He said: I want to revisit this issue. In 1963, it was so widely accepted that the death penalty was unconstitutional that the defendants in other cases didn't challenge its constitutionality. He made the argument on their behalf. There are no Goldbergs anymore. It's hard to imagine a justice today saying 'I want to raise this up to national agenda.' The court is so often in the business of following change rather than leading it."" CNN:  One of the key characters in your book is the prominent criminal appellate attorney and legal scholar Alan Dershowitz. He was Goldberg's law clerk at the time and helped formulate the legal reasoning. Mandery: ""I hope people understand what an extraordinary, revolutionary, and subversive idea that Goldberg and his partner Dershowitz advanced in 1963. Whatever your views on the death penalty and the Supreme Court, everyone acknowledges as a subject of discussion that the Constitution is an evolving document and that the death penalty is constitutionally problematic, if not unconstitutional. In 1963, when they started, nobody did. It was revolutionary."" CNN:  What was the political fallout from Goldberg's prodding? Mandery:  ""After Goldberg publishes his dissent (on the court's initial refusal to hear a death penalty constitutional appeal), the legal people at the NAACP sensed something was afoot, and they begin constructing a campaign to try to bring executions in the U.S. to a halt. The NAACP legal defense team, for a 10-year period, got courts to stop executions, not by winning a broad decision at the federal level, but buy winning dozens of local cases, raising legal arguments in individual cases. It's an astonishing accomplishment, whatever your views of capital punishment."" CNN:  So by 1972, the Supreme Court was ready to fully tackle the constitutional questions. It ultimately struck down capital punishment — effectively voiding laws in 40 states -- but why were the justices unable to agree on the reasoning? Mandery:  ""There is one particular quirk about this history that acted as a barrier to a consensus view coalescing. At the beginning of the 1971 term when Furman was decided, (Chief Justice) Warren Burger said he wanted the case to be conducted in complete secrecy. And he wanted each justice to write his own opinion. And consequently the justices operated in almost complete isolation throughout the term, which had some very bizarre results. It was one of the contributing factors to the splintering of this 5-4 decision with nine opinions. ""It's almost impossible to discuss the case because there is no majority opinion. (Liberal Justices) Brennan, Marshall, and Douglas wrote opinions that really seemed to be against the death penalty in all cases. Douglas' decision was premised basically on the issue of racism, Brennan's on human dignity, Marshall on a host of consideration including inequality. (Justice's) Stewart and White's opinions are the most closely aligned. Stewart said the problem with the death penalty is its randomness among murderers, White says the problem with the death penalty is that it isn't applied frequently enough to achieve deterrence. Even the four dissenters couldn't agree."" Test your knowledge of the Supreme Court . CNN:  You write Potter Stewart (appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower) and Byron White (appointed by President John Kennedy) were the key players here. Mandery:  ""There's a lot of evidence that Stewart made a deal with White because he emerged (in June 1972) with a changed position on capital punishment. Where he had previously been against it in all cases, White was now taking the position that his problem with the death penalty was its application. He told his clerks at the beginning of the term that he wanted to write a ""short snapper"" saying that the death penalty treated people as a means to an end, and was therefore unconstitutional. And there are hints in some of Stewart's earlier opinions that he was, in fact, morally opposed to capital punishment. But that is not the position that he ultimately articulated in his concurrence in Furman."" CNN:  But by 1976, that all unraveled. What happened? Mandery:  ""Grand political theories of judicial behavior don't explain very much. These are socially situated actors who have different views at different times and are responding to their perceptions of their own constituencies. They're not elected but they feel that they are answering to people. It's a very messy history."" CNN:  Is there something about the death penalty itself that makes the court's jurisprudence so problematic-- the finality, the questions of life and death. Mandery:  ""There is something different about the death penalty. It's not surprising during this four-year interim period that each of these justices -- with the exception of (conservative William) Rehnquist, who doesn't seem troubled at all by this -- each has their antenna up. It's not like a tax case. But I don't think it's categorically different than Roe (abortion rights) or the civil rights cases. I just think we don't know all the behind-the-scenes stories because these are very hard to write. But I got incredibly lucky. I had a moment in history when the archives were available to me, as were many of the key players that I interviewed. All agreed there was definitely at the time tremendous frustration with how Chief Justice Burger was managing the cases. His colleagues had little respect for him. ""So by 1976, 37 states had passed new death penalty laws and they tried to remove arbitrariness in its application-- based on what the court has mandated -- or at least made a good faith effort to attempt to do this. One of the great stories in my book is that Powell, Stewart, and (Justice John Paul) Stevens met at a local restaurant called the Monocle, and there agreed that the mandatory death penalty for murder was reprehensible, but that they would also uphold the 'guided discretions' statutes (through the use of what are called 'aggravating' or 'mitigating' factors either favoring or blocking its use). That was their Solomonic compromise. The 1976 compromise was that similar capital cases should be treated alike. But also that no mandatory death penalty for certain crimes means individual cases must be treated individually. It's a fundamental contradiction that has made death penalty law in the U.S. for the past 40 years at a minimum confusing and problematic, at a maximum completely inconsistent and incomprehensible."" CNN:  Is the current court ready to tackle the issue again? Mandery:  ""It certainly seems that it merits another day in court after 40 years. There are a lot of reasons to think that (moderate-conservative) Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote is up for grabs and his mind is open on this question. So I don't think the outcome of a case would be predetermined one way or another."" CNN:  What has the court said on mandatory DNA testing and re-testing for all capital inmates? Mandery:  ""Imagine what a difference it would make if the Supreme Court said that states were required to have DNA exoneration projects as part of their death penalty systems. In other words, if they guaranteed somebody that type of post-conviction appeal. They've removed themselves utterly from the process of trying to make the system better. Everybody agrees that the conviction and execution of an innocent person is morally intolerable and yet the Supreme Court hasn't gotten involved in the business of what's required, how much due process is required, how much extra due process is required, to protect against the execution of an innocent.""","Supreme Court struck down capital punishment in 1972, but executions resumed four years later .

"(CNN) -- Aziz Ansari's never pulls punches in his stand-up, but there is a joke in his new comedy special that really pushes the envelope (forget worrying about a spoiler; we couldn't tell it here if we wanted to). Let's just say it involves child molestation, and the audience loves it. The ""Parks and Recreation"" star said he doesn't worry about getting caught on the wrong side of the politically correct crew as has happened to some comedians. ""I think you have to take that all case by case to see if it makes sense,"" he said. His new special, ""Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive,"" will debut on November 1 on Netflix. The comic is known for being innovative in getting his comedy to fans and said the online streaming service made sense to him. ""I think people now just like to watch stuff, whatever they want and watching whenever,"" he said during a conference call about his new project. ""I've done every kind of method, like releasing my stuff for $5."" One clip from the special that has been making the rounds on YouTube features Ansari poking fun at the institution of marriage and family, life events a few of the 30-year-old's friends are experiencing now. ""I write stand-up about whatever is kind of going on in my life, whatever is in my head,"" he said. ""And I ended up writing the special mostly about that."" Ansari prowls the stage at the Merriam Theater in Philadelphia, where the special was filmed, dressed in a suit with a flower on his lapel. His jokes cover a lot of ground, from the aforementioned pedophilia to marriage equality. On the controversy surrounding the Chick-fil-A boycott, he said it was a bit of a conundrum: ""Obviously I'm very pro gay marriage, but I'm also very pro delicious chicken sandwich."" Ansari also takes on those in his generation and how different they are from those of past generations, who, to Ansari, seem more elegant. ""If those generations could be a font, they would be Times New Roman,"" he said. ""I look at my generation, we're f***ing Comic Sans! You can't take us seriously, we're Comic Sans!"" Yes, he's getting older, but Ansari said he doesn't miss being in his 20s, other than ""being able to say you're in your 20s."" Ansari, who started doing standup while a student at New York University, said today's aspiring comics should focus on their material. ""(Young comedians) are like, 'Oh, I got to start making videos and I got to maintain a Twitter thread on this site,'"" he said. ""I think that is probably doing more harm than good, because all I really cared about was being really good at stand-up."" And while he is aware that his TV show, ""Parks and Recreation,"" has some rabid fans, he said he thinks his stand-up fans aren't necessarily there because he's on the NBC comedy. ""Whenever I do stand-up, I feel like those are people that know my stand-up,"" he said. ""There might be some overlap with 'Parks' fans, but when I did my first theater tour, if I mentioned my cousin Harris or something, everyone would respond, so I think that means that they've seen the stand-up. I don't feel there are many people that are seeing 'Parks' and then they're like, 'Oh, let me spend X amount of dollars to see this guy do stand-up. Maybe he's funny.'

"A judge has scheduled a new hearing for a U.S. Marine and Afghanistan war veteran who's been held in a Mexican prison for nearly two months, a judicial source said. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi's next day in court is scheduled for June 4, a Mexican government judicial source told CNN. The judge started and then quickly suspended a hearing Wednesday after Tahmooressi fired his attorneys, the source said. But the Marine's mother, Jill Tahmooressi, said the next hearing is still weeks away as it will take time for the new attorney to be briefed. Sgt. Tahmooressi is accused of illegally entering Mexico with three weapons. His family maintains that he legally owned the weapons and accidentally crossed the border. It is illegal to bring guns into Mexico. Jill Tahmooressi told CNN Wednesday that her son had made an innocent mistake. ""He is relieved that he'll be able to go before the judge and explain precisely how he made that accidental wrong turn and ended up in the dilemma that he's in right now,"" she said. The case has draw attention from several U.S. lawmakers and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who told CNN Wednesday that he spoke with Mexican authorities about it last week. ""We are working on determining whether or not certain evidence that has been presented is meeting the standard that's necessary to be able to hold that young Marine, and we're trying to find out exactly what the fact pattern is, but we are working on that,"" he told Chris Cuomo on CNN's ""New Day."" 911 call: 'I crossed the border by accident' ""I'm at the border of Mexico right now. And my problem is, I, I crossed the border by accident and I have three guns in my truck and they're trying to take my guns from me,"" the Marine told a 911 dispatcher in March. In a recording of the call released by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, the Marine appears unsure of whether he crossed the border and exasperated that Mexican authorities are trying to take his weapons. ""There's nothing I can help you with then, sir,"" the 911 dispatcher says after learning he's in Mexico. ""I do apologize. You're not on American soil anymore."" Tahmooressi asks if authorities have a right to take his guns. The dispatcher tells him he should have seen large warning signs on the freeway saying it's illegal to enter Mexico with guns. ""There are warning signs that do say that as you're driving down the freeway, before you enter Mexico,"" she says. ""Yeah, I was hoping there would be a turnaround point,"" he says, ""but there never was."" Mom: Marine had been preparing to start fresh . The Marine's mom said he accidentally crossed into Mexico with three personal firearms -- all bought legally in the U.S. The 25-year-old had intended to drive to meet friends in San Ysidro, California, on March 31. He was moving from Florida to California in the hope of getting a job and continuing treatment he had just begun for post traumatic stress related to his two combat tours, she said. With all his possessions in his truck, Tahmooressi accidentally drove across the border, she said. When he realized his mistake, his mother said, he dialed 911 and asked the operator to help him. No help came, Jill Tahmooressi said. Her son first encountered Mexican customs agents, she said, and he believed they understood that he'd made an innocent error. They seemed to be getting an escort car to help him, she said. But officers with the Mexican military interfered, she told ""New Day,"" and her son was arrested. Now he's in isolation -- being held away from the general population in a Mexican federal prison -- and is constantly watched by a guard, she said. Letter to lawmakers . The Marine has tried to appeal to U.S. lawmakers. ""I accidentally drove into Mexico with 3 guns ... a rifle (AR-15), a .45 cal pistol and a 12 gauge pump shotgun with no intensions (sic) on being in Mexico or being involved in any criminal activities,"" Andrew Tahmooressi wrote in a statement of innocence to Hunter, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. ""I have rights to all 3 weapons,"" he wrote. ""They are under my name. ... Please help me."" Hunter is among several lawmakers who have petitioned for Tahmooressi's release. ""Mexico's Attorney General is in a position to deal with Andrew's case and ensure its quick resolution. ... It is necessary that the AG intervene and expedite proceedings at the very least. And so far there's been no validation from Mexico that Andrew didn't make a directional mistake at the border,"" Hunter said in a statement this month.","Marine's mother: The next  hearing for Sgt.

"A Sudanese woman has been freed from prison a month after being sentenced to die by hanging for refusing to renounce her Christian faith. ""I am a Christian,"" Meriam Yehya Ibrahim told the judge at her sentencing hearing in May, ""and I will remain a Christian."" An appeals court in Sudan ruled that a lower court's judgment against the 27-year-old was faulty, her lawyer, Mohaned Mustafa El-Nour, said Monday.  He declined to elaborate. An international controversy erupted over Ibraham's conviction in May by a Sudanese court on charges of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith, and adultery.  Ibrahim was eight months pregnant when was sentenced to suffer 100 lashes and then be hanged. ""I'm so frustrated. I don't know what to do,"" her husband, Daniel Wani told CNN in May. ""I'm just praying.""  Wani, uses a wheelchair and ""totally depends on her for all details of his life,"" Ibrahim's lawyer said. Ibrahim was reunited with her husband after getting out of custody, her lawyer said Monday. Ibrahim gave birth to a girl in a prison last month, two weeks after she was sentenced.  She was in the women's prison with her 20-month-old son, but Sudanese officials said the toddler was free to leave at any time, according to her lawyer. The criminal complaint filed by a brother, a Muslim, said her family was shocked to find out Ibrahim had married a Christian, U.S. citizen Daniel Wani, after she was missing for several years, according to her lawyer.  A Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is not considered legal in Sudan, thus the adultery charge. The apostasy charge came because Ibrahim proclaimed herself to be Christian, not Muslim.  Her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, was abandoned by her Sudanese Muslim father when Ibrahim was just 6 and she was raised as a Christian, she said. Sudanese Parliament speaker Fatih Izz Al-Deen defended the conviction last month, insisting that claims that Ibrahim was raised as non-Muslim are untrue.  She was raised in an Islamic environment, Al-Deen said. The lower court had warned Ibrahim to renounce her Christianity by May 15, but she held firm to her beliefs while her lawyer appealed the conviction and sentence. Her sentence had drawn international condemnation from rights groups and foreign embassies in Khartoum, including those of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

"Scores of copies of Anne Frank's diary and other books covering the Holocaust held by public libraries across Tokyo have been vandalized, local government officials said Friday. Pages have been torn out of at least 167 books -- most of them versions of ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl"" -- said authorities in the Suginami and Nakano wards of Tokyo. The diary, which has been read by millions of people around the world, is a Jewish girl's account of hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam during World War II. Local media in Japan have reported that the recent spate of vandalism of the book in Tokyo is more widespread than the just Suginami and Nakano. Damage to at least 265 copies of Anne Frank's diary has been discovered at 31 libraries since January, the Kyodo news agency reported. The reports have stoked concern beyond Japan. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Los Angeles-based Jewish human rights organization, expressed ""shock"" at the news. ""The geographic scope of these incidents strongly suggest an organized effort to denigrate the memory of the most famous of the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis in the World War II Holocaust,"" Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the center, said in a statement. Anne and her family spent 25 months hiding in cramped quarters in Amsterdam, living in fear of discovery by the Nazis. They were betrayed, arrested and deported in August 1944. Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp just weeks before it was liberated in 1945. Cooper said the Simon Wiesenthal Center is ""calling on Japanese authorities to step up efforts to identify and deal with the perpetrators of this hate campaign."" The Japanese government said Friday that the police will fully investigate the matter, according to Kyodo. ""We cannot accept it,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a news conference. ""It's extremely regrettable and shameful."" Authorities in Suginami ward said pages had been torn from at least 119 books about Anne Frank, including her diary, in 11 public libraries. The first case of damage in the ward was reported February 6. In Nakano ward, authorities said 54 books from 5 libraries were found to have ripped pages. Most of the books are about Anne Frank, the ward said, but others are about the Auschwitz concentration camp. Both wards said that so far they had been unable to identify the cause of the vandalism.","Libraries in Tokyo report vandalism targeting copies of famous Holocaust account .

"(CNN) -- With 25 million people in its path, Super Typhoon Haiyan -- one of the strongest storms recorded on the planet -- smashed into the Philippines on Friday morning. As the storm plowed across the cluster of islands in the heart of the country, casualties were reported, more than 100,000 people took shelter in evacuation centers and hundreds of flights were canceled. The storm brought tremendously powerful winds roaring ashore as it made landfall in the province of Eastern Visayas, disrupting communications with a major city in its path. With sustained winds of 315 kph (195 mph) and gusts as strong as 380 kph (235 mph), Haiyan was probably the strongest tropical cyclone to hit land anywhere in the world in recorded history. It will take further analysis after the storm passes to establish whether it is a record. As the monster storm spun toward the Philippines on Thursday, President Benigno S. Aquino III warned the nation that it faced a ""calamity."" Category 5 strength . Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, appeared to retain much of its terrifying force as it moved west over the country, with sustained winds of 295 kph, gusts as strong as 360 kph. Haiyan's wind strength makes it equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane. Video footage from on the ground in the Philippines showed howling winds bending palm trees and whipping debris down deserted streets. Gov. Roger Mercado of Southern Leyte, a province in Eastern Visayas, said Friday morning that ""all roads"" were impassable because of fallen trees. He said it was too soon to gauge the level of devastation caused by Haiyan. ""We don't know the extent of the damage,"" Mercaod said. ""We are trying to estimate this. We are prepared, but this is really a wallop."" The typhoon was forecast to churn across the central Philippines during Friday and part of Saturday before exiting into the South China Sea. The storm is expected to weaken slightly as it moves across land, but forecasters predict that it will maintain super typhoon intensity throughout its passage over the islands. A super typhoon has surface winds that sustain speeds of more than 240 kph for at least a minute, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Haiyan is so large in diameter that clouds from it are affecting two-thirds of the country, which stretches more than 1,850 kilometers (1,150 miles). Tropical-storm-force winds are extending 240 kilometers from the typhoon's center. iReport: Heavy rains as Philippines braces for typhoon . 'Very real danger' The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said Friday that one person had been confirmed dead as a result of the storm in the eastern province of Surigao del Sur. Authorities in Cebu said they were unable to establish whether a woman who was hit by a falling coconut tree in the north of the province was dead or injured. Neil Sanchez, a provincial disaster management official, said authorities had lost contact with the town where the incident happened. On Thursday morning, a day before the storm arrived, a 1-year-old child and another person died after they were hit by debris from a tornado in the southern province of Cotabato, authorities said. It was unclear whether the tornado was related to the approaching typhoon. Ahead of the typhoon's arrival, thousands of people had been relocated away from particularly vulnerable areas in Tacloban City, which is situated in a coastal area of the region that bore the initial brunt of the storm. Communications with Tacloban, which has a population of around 200,000, were disrupted after the typhoon struck. Video aired by CNN affiliate ABS-CBN showed streets in the city flooded with water and debris. In a speech Thursday, Aquino warned residents of the ""calamity our countrymen will face in these coming days."" ""Let me repeat myself: This is a very real danger, and we can mitigate and lessen its effects if we use the information available to prepare,"" he said. Authorities have aircraft ready to respond, and officials have placed relief supplies in the areas that are expected to get hit, Aquino said. ""The effects of this storm can be eased through solidarity,"" he said. Earthquake survivors vulnerable . Authorities have warned dozens of provinces across the country to be prepared for possible flash floods and landslides. About 125,000 people nationwide were moved to evacuation centers . Some of the most vulnerable people are those living in temporary shelters on the central Philippine island of Bohol. Last month, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit the island, which lies close to the typhoon's predicted path. The quake killed at least 222 people, injured nearly 1,000 and displaced about 350,000, according to authorities. ""This has been a quake hit area, for the past three weeks people are still experiencing aftershocks,"" said Aaron Aspi, a communications specialist in Bohol for the charity World Vision. ""and at the same time these rains are giving them a really hard time."" ""Most of them are advised to evacuate to sturdy structures,"" he said. ""But there are a few thousand displaced families in quake hit areas that are still staying in makeshift tents and now that the super typhoon is here it is really heart breaking to see them struggling."" Aspi said many peoples' tents are drenched but they still too afraid to relocate to enclosed structures because of the aftershocks. Beach resort threatened . Another island in the storm's likely trajectory is the popular beach resort of Boracay. Some tourists there were cutting their vacations short to get away from the possible danger. Ross Evans, an aviation professional from Florida, said there was ""a definite urgency and panic"" among the long lines of holidaymakers waiting for boats to get off Boracay on Thursday. Speaking by phone before his flight to Manila took off, he said he felt ""horrible"" for those who may end up stuck in the storm's path. Evans said he and his travel companions, who are leaving the Philippines two days earlier than planned, ""feel very fortunate to have the ability to make arrangements to be safe."" Situated near an area of the Pacific Ocean where tropical cyclones form, the Philippines regularly suffers severe storm damage. An average of 20 typhoons hit the archipelagic nation every year, and several of those cause serious damage. In December, Typhoon Bopha wreaked widespread devastation on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. The storm, the most powerful to hit the country that year, is estimated to have killed as many as 1,900 people. CNN's Aliza Kassim, Karen Smith, Elwyn Lopez, Judy Kwon, Taylor Ward, Brandon Miller, Ivan Cabrera and Mari Ramos contributed to this report.","NEW: ""This is really a wallop,"" says the governor of a typhoon-hit province .

"(CNN)Doctors in Macon, Georgia, told Janea Cox that her daughter, Haleigh, might not live another three months. That was the middle of March, when Haleigh's brain was being short-circuited by hundreds of seizures a day, overrunning the array of five potent drugs meant to control them. Worse, the drugs were damaging Haleigh's organs. ""She was maxed out,"" Cox said. ""She'd quit breathing several times a day, and the doctors blamed it on the seizure medications."" Cox had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help, but it wasn't available in central Georgia. So a week after hearing the ominous diagnosis, she and Haleigh packed up and moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. There, Haleigh began a regimen of cannabis oil: four times a day and once at night. By summer, she was down to just a handful of seizures a day. In less than three months, doctors were able to wean her off Depakote, a powerful medication that had been damaging her liver. Haleigh had never been able to walk or talk. But freed from seizures in Colorado, ""She said 'Mama' for the first time,"" Cox said.  ""She's playing with puzzles; she's walking. She's almost being a normal child."" Despite all the good news, Cox is living in limbo. Her husband, a paramedic, couldn't afford to leave his job and pension; he still lives and works in Forsyth, Georgia. The family is relying on charity to keep their Colorado apartment for the next few months; beyond that, the future is uncertain. A bill being introduced Monday in the U.S. House of Representatives could be Cox's ticket home. The three-page bill would amend the Controlled Substances Act -- the federal law that criminalizes marijuana -- to exempt plants with an extremely low percentage of THC, the chemical that makes users high. Gupta: Why I changed my mind on weed . If passed, it would be the first time that federal law allows any medical marijuana use. ""No one should face a choice of having their child suffer or moving to Colorado and splitting up their family,"" said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pennsylvania, the bill's sponsor. ""We live in America, and if there's something that would make my child better, and they can't get it because of the government, that's not right."" The bill will land in a Congress that may be open to change. Across the country, highly sympathetic patients and a nonintoxicating product have proved a popular mix. This year alone, 11 states have passed legislation loosening regulation of cannabis strains with high cannabidiol and/or minimal THC content. In this atmosphere, Perry says that once members and their staffs are brought up to speed, he expects the bill to attract ""overwhelming"" support. ""It wouldn't be surprising if we see broad support for this proposal,"" agreed Mason Tvert, communications director at the Marijuana Policy Project, which advocates for marijuana and medical marijuana legalization. ""If this bill gets support, it will demonstrate that there is recognition of marijuana's medical benefits."" Dubbed the Charlotte's Web Medical Hemp Act of 2014, the bill is named after Charlotte Figi, a young Colorado girl whose parents have campaigned nationwide for easier access to medical marijuana after successfully controlling their daughter's seizures with cannabis oil. Since her story became known, a growing number of parents have flocked to Colorado, hoping for similar success. The Charlotte's Web cannabis strain, developed by the Realm of Caring nonprofit organization in Colorado Springs, is in high demand, in part because of the attention it's received in the media. Many families wait months for a batch to be grown and processed into cannabis oil. Perry's bill, however, would apply to any cannabis strain with a THC content of less than 0.3%. Charlotte's Web and similar strains not only have minimal THC, they have high levels of cannabidiol, another chemical. A growing body of anecdotal evidence suggests that cannabidiol can effectively control seizures, though there are no published studies to support its use. It's easy to find critics who say parents should follow a more traditional route. ""There is no evidence for marijuana as a treatment for seizures,"" Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, a physician, claimed during a congressional hearing last month. ""We hear anecdotal stories, and that's how myths come about."" Fleming and others point out that a pharmaceutical version of cannabidiol oil, called Epidiolex, is being tested in clinical trials. But many children aren't able to get into the trials. Haleigh Cox is disqualified because she has type-1 diabetes. Others aren't willing to wait several months to be enrolled. ""With Epidiolex, there just aren't enough seats at the table,"" said Mark Knecht, a father from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, whose story helped inspire Perry's bill. His daughter Anna, 11, has epilepsy and suffers anywhere from a handful of seizures a day to more than 100, despite her four anti-convulsant medications. Knecht, the chief financial officer of a large Christian medical nonprofit, says Anna has been evaluated at several top hospitals but couldn't land a spot in the Epidiolex trial. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books allowing medical marijuana for a variety of conditions. But even as states rewrite their regulations, federal law remains the same: Marijuana is illegal to grow, sell or use for any purpose. Under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is listed on Schedule 1, meaning it has ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" To backers of reform, the Catch-22 is familiar: Marijuana is restricted in large part because there is little research to support medical uses; research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions. A series of memos from the Justice Department has said that arresting individual medical marijuana users is not a priority, and a 2013 memo added that federal prosecutors should not target large commercial operations except on a case-by-case basis. But most observers say that shipping or transporting the drug across state lines ups the ante. ""For families like us, the biggest issue is the federal issue. You can't take it across state lines,"" Knecht explained. His family still lives in Mechanicsburg. But after seeing CNN's medical marijuana documentary last year, Anna and her mother, Deb, established residency in Colorado, where they obtained a medical marijuana card that let them place an order for a batch cannabis oil, in hopes it will control Anna's seizures. If Perry's bill becomes law, Knecht says, ""Realm of Caring could just put it in a FedEx package."" The Food and Drug Administration is conducting a review of scientific evidence to determine whether marijuana warrants looser treatment, but a spokeswoman says there's no set date to complete the analysis. A review in 2011 ended with the Drug Enforcement Administration leaving marijuana's status unaltered. But certain actions in Congress give Perry and his supporters hope. This month, the House passed a bill allowing banks to handle cash proceeds from dispensaries and other legal marijuana businesses. The most recent Farm Bill allows industrial hemp -- a strain of cannabis without THC -- to be grown for academic or research purposes. That didn't stop the Drug Enforcement Administration from seizing a shipment of hemp seeds bound for the University of Kentucky this spring. In response, the Senate Appropriations Committee, with support from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,  passed an amendment blocking DEA funds for anti-hemp enforcement. In May, the House passed a measure blocking money for DEA raids on marijuana dispensaries that are legal under state law. And just last week, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky took it a step further, introducing an amendment to the Jobs Bill that would forbid federal prosecution of doctors and patients whose actions are legal under state medical marijuana laws. ""If states allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana, and people are in good faith prescribing medical marijuana, we want to make sure it's OK and that the federal government doesn't come in and prosecute somebody,"" said Brian Darling, Paul's communications director. The amendment seems likely to die amidst wrangling over the Jobs Bill, but Darling says his boss plans to move forward on a standalone measure. Too many people have been sentenced to long prison terms for possession of marijuana, Darling says. ""The War on Drugs has gone overboard."" Knecht doesn't want to uproot his family to move to Colorado. But he says his hand may be forced. ""We're taking this situation one day at a time."" That's where Janea Cox was a few months ago. She hadn't heard about Perry's bill until she got a call from a reporter but says she understands where the Pennsylvania families are coming from. She's angry at home-state lawmakers who failed to push through Georgia's cannabidiol oil bill this spring. ""I lived in Georgia for 17 years,"" she said, ""but here in Colorado, I met my child for the first time, at the age of 5.""

"Two names and two families at the heart of a tragedy. Al-Samani al-Hadi is one of three brothers, and what he calls their ""private family business"" has captured the attention of the world. ""Firstly I want to say, I am the brother of the convicted woman Abrar al-Hadi"", he tells CNN in his first sit-down interview since the woman he claims is his sister -- known as Mariam Yahya Ibrahim in media reports -- was sentenced to death by a court in Sudan for abandoning the Muslim faith. The woman, 27, was raised as a Christian by her mother and is married to a Christian man. But because her father -- who deserted the family when the woman was a child -- was Muslim, the courts consider her to be the same and asked her to recant her faith. She refused, and is now languishing in Omdurman Women's Prison, just outside Khartoum. ""Her name isn't Mariam, her name is Abrar al-Hadi. I am al-Samani al-Hadi Mohamed Abdullah, her full -- older -- brother,"" al-Hadi, speaking to CNN from an Islamic Center in Omdurman, tells us as he rattles off dates and details in an attempt to prove this is the sister he grew up with. He says she started primary school in 1992, and middle school eight years later. He even remembers the score she got on a critical exam -- ""she got a 73.7 percent,"" according to al-Hadi. Al-Hadi says his mother and brothers attended their sister's university graduation ceremony in Khartoum. Nothing, he says, seemed amiss. Then, he says, she met her husband Daniel and his sister. He claims Daniel -- whom he called ""the Priest"" -- fed his sister ""potions"" to convert her to Christianity. Daniel Wani and his wife tell a very different story. They say they were introduced through his sister in 2009 and married in 2011. Mariam, as Wani calls his wife, was a committed Christian -- attending church with a frequency that far outstripped his own. Wani says he never saw the man claiming to be his brother-in-law until the trial began. When I put this to Al-Samani al-Hadi, he tells me: ""Then she is lying to both the Christians and the Muslims."" ""She went missing in Ramadan [July] last year for 45 days. That's when we went to the police. When she was picked up we found her face was different, the way she looked at us was different. She was bewitched. ""When she stood in front of the court she said her name was Mariam Yahya. We were shocked."" The case dragged on for seven months, during which time they brought fingerprint and identity documentation, photocopies of which have since been disseminated to local reporters. The documents -- which the court ruled to be genuine -- purport to show that the fingerprints recorded for the national identity card issued in the name of ""Abrar"" at the Sudanese government registry offices were an exact match to those the court took from Mariam. Wani told CNN that even if his wife is released, he fears for his family's safety from al-Hadi and his brothers. Wani is a U.S. citizen and is attempting to secure asylum there for his wife, along with citizenship for his two children. That process, he says, is being delayed by U.S. demands for paternity testing of the children. When asked by reporters earlier in the week if this was true, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, ""Genetic testing is a useful tool for verifying a biological relationship."" Mariam -- or Abrar -- is currently hoping her that the courts will believe the story of her life as she tells it, according to her husband. She insists that she was brought up by a Christian mother and has never practiced Islam. And in spite of visits by religious scholars and Sudanese government officials pressuring her to recant, it's a story she's sticking to. I found myself returning to the same question time and again in this interview -- is al-Hadi really prepared to see the woman he claims is his sister killed? ""It's one of two; if she repents and returns to our Islamic faith and to the embrace of our family then we are her family and she is ours. We are prepared to hold her dearer than the apples of our eyes. But if she refuses she should be executed."" Even as all eyes are on Sudan's Court of Appeal, for al-Hadi there is no turning back. ""Why would I indulge my humanity, my emotions and incur the wrath of my Lord? That's not how it works for us."" READ MORE: Husband of jailed woman fears for family's lives .

"The Israeli embassy and Jewish community in Japan are donating 300 Anne Frank-related books to public libraries in Tokyo after hundreds of copies of the girl's diary and other publications about the Holocaust were vandalized across the city. Damage to at least 308 books has been discovered at 38 libraries since January, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. Most of them were versions of ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl."" The book, which has been read by millions of people around the world, is a Jewish girl's account of hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam during World War II. ""The reaction in Israel was of surprise, because our relations with Japan and Japanese people are so warm ... but I think everyone understands that it's a single act that doesn't represent Japanese people,"" said the embassy's deputy chief of mission, Peleg Lewi Thursday as he presented the first of the books to the mayor of Suginami ward, where much of the vandalism occurred. Sympathy and goodwill . The embassy decided to replace the damaged books after receiving an outpouring of sympathy and goodwill from the government and people of Japan -- including ""a thousand"" calls, mails and e-mails apologizing for the incident, a press officer at the embassy, Ronen Mezini told CNN. ""We are thankful for the thousands of positive and encouraging messages we've received from the Japanese people,"" Lewi said. ""The diaries of Anne Frank represent a message of tolerance between people, and awareness to the holocaust,"" he added. Frank and her family spent 25 months hiding in cramped quarters in the Dutch city, living in fear of discovery by the occupying Nazis. But in August 1944, they were betrayed, arrested and eventually sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Frank and her sister Margot were then transferred to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they died during a typhus epidemic just weeks before it was liberated in 1945. Their mother, Edith, died at Auschwitz, leaving their father, Otto, as the only surviving member of the family. Raise awareness . In Suginami, pages were torn from at least 119 books about Frank, including her diary, in 11 public libraries, according to authorities. The first case of damage in the ward was reported on February 6. Suginami's mayor said Thursday he hoped the situation would help to raise awareness of the Holocaust among Japanese people. ""Through this incident, I believe that people also learned about the horrid facts of history and of racism, and with this knowledge, I hope that our people were given an opportunity to reflect on the preciousness of peace,"" said Mayor Roy Tanaka.

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid apologized Saturday for making racially insensitive remarks about Barack Obama during the presidential campaign. Journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann reported the remarks in their new book, ""Game Change,"" which is scheduled to be in bookstores Tuesday. The authors quote Reid as saying privately that Obama, as a black candidate, could be successful thanks, in part, to his ""light-skinned"" appearance and speaking patterns ""with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one."" ""He [Reid] was wowed by Obama's oratorical gifts and believed that the country was ready to embrace a black presidential candidate, especially one such as Obama -- a 'light-skinned' African American 'with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one,' "" Halperin and Heilemann say. ""Reid was convinced, in fact, that Obama's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for the Democratic nomination,"" they write. In a statement to CNN, Reid said, ""I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words."" ""I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African Americans for my improper comments. ""I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama's legislative agenda,"" the senator from Nevada said. Reid pointed to his efforts to integrate the Las Vegas Strip and the gaming industry, among other legislation favored by African-American voters. ""I have worked hard to advance issues important to the African American community."" The senator called Obama Saturday afternoon to apologize for the racially insensitive remarks. ""Harry Reid called me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today,"" Obama said in a statement. ""I accepted Harry's apology without question because I've known him for years, I've seen the passionate leadership he's shown on issues of social justice and I know what's in his heart. As far as I am concerned, the book is closed."" Reid, who waited to formally endorse Obama until after the tough presidential primary battle ended in 2008, is facing an uphill re-election fight this year in his home state. An aide to the senator told CNN that Reid offered apologies to several prominent African-Americans, including House Democrats Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and Barbara Lee of California; the Rev. Al Sharpton; CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile; NAACP chairman Julian Bond; and the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Wade Henderson.

"Rockets from Gaza hit Israel early Friday morning, breaching a cease-fire that had held for more than two days, the Israeli military said. ""Moments ago, 2 rockets fired from Gaza hit southern Israel. Terrorists have violated the cease-fire,"" the Israel Defense Forces wrote on Twitter. It wasn't immediately clear how Israel would respond. The IDF pulled its ground forces out of Gaza on Tuesday but said they were maintaining ""defensive positions"" around the territory. ""I suspect the Israelis are going to wait to see if it was just these two rockets,"" said CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""These could be isolated rockets."" But if more rockets are fired from Gaza, ""the Israelis will strike back,"" Blitzer said. The two rockets landed near Eshkol in southern Israel but didn't cause any damage or casualties, the Israeli military said. It wasn't immediately clear who in Gaza, where multiple militant factions are active, launched them. Hamas, which holds power in Gaza, denies firing the rockets, said Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for the group. The allegations ""are based on Israeli reports aimed at confusing the situation,"" the Gaza-based spokesman said. Talks in Cairo . Earlier, negotiators in Cairo had been scrambling to extend the Gaza cease-fire, which was set to expire at 8 a.m. Friday (1 a.m. ET). A Hamas official had told supporters in Gaza City that the group was ready to resume fighting if it didn't win key concessions in the talks. ""We are ready to return to the battle if the Palestinian demands are not met in Cairo,"" Hamas spokesman Mosher al-Masry told a crowd of supporters waving the group's green flags. A spokesman for Hamas' military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, was even more pointed. ""We demand from the negotiating team to pull out from negotiations if the enemy continues to be stubborn; we are ready for a long war,"" Abu Obaida said on Hamas-run Al-Aqsa television. ""We demand that the negotiating team not extend negotiations without the agreement on a seaport,"" he said, demanding that the blockade against Gaza be lifted, and all the crossings into Egypt and Israel be opened. ""We will not accept anything less,"" the spokesman said. ""We will make the tanks of the enemy a toy in the hands of the children of Gaza."" As the spokesman suggested, Hamas wants Israel to end border restrictions that limit the flow of people and goods into and out of Gaza. Israel wants Hamas to give up its weapons. Israel is willing to extend the truce unconditionally, Dore Gold, a senior foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told CNN on Thursday. Earlier, in a heated interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day,"" Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said if the cease-fire was to hold, Israel must show signs of willingness to reach a broader deal before the truce expires. ""There is no decision to undermine the talks, there is no decision to go back to fight,"" he said. ""But we have to evaluate what the Israelis are doing, what the Israelis are saying."" Officials from Israel and the Palestinian side -- including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Palestine Liberation Organization -- are communicating through Egyptian intermediaries in an effort to reach agreement on extending the truce. Hoping for a breakthrough . A Palestinian official said Thursday morning that there had been progress in the talks so far but declined to give any details. ""I am not sure how or when it will come, but we hope for a breakthrough,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. The warring sides are far apart. Israel says Hamas must disarm as part of any larger deal that might lead to the end of border restrictions and greater economic freedom for Gaza residents. Hamas, meanwhile, says the blockade must end before a lasting peace deal can be reached. Israel must also stop activities in response to the kidnapping of three Israeli teens who were later found dead and facilitate reconstruction of the territory's devastated infrastructure, Hamdan told CNN. ""We can't talk about future while the Israelis are putting a pistol to our heads or a knife to our necks,"" he said. Gold told ""New Day"" that the border restrictions and Gaza's economic and redevelopment needs can't be separated because they are ""intimately linked."" ""If you want cement for building homes or schools, you've got to make sure the cement goes there and not rebuilding attack tunnels that go into Israel,"" he said. He also said Hamas' demands for a Mediterranean Sea port raise serious security concerns for Israel. ""We're of course concerned if something like that occurs, that the Iranians or others will bring missile boats into the Mediterranean and to that Gaza port,"" Gold said. ""So it's not so simple as to say, 'Give them a port.' "" Latest death toll . On Thursday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health issued new casualty numbers for the conflict -- 1,888 deaths, including 446 children, and 9,804 injured. It's unclear how many of the Palestinian dead were militants. The United Nations has estimated that at least 70% of the dead were civilians. The Israel Defense Forces believes it killed about 900 militants -- roughly half of the dead. Israeli officials have said 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel died. Additionally, about 65,000 Gaza residents lost their homes to the fighting, according to U.N. estimates. Palestinian-American: 'Living in occupation felt normal' Israeli regret over civilian deaths . Israel has come under growing international criticism over the number of civilian casualties, notably from the United Nations, which accused the Israeli military of shelling its shelters. In Jerusalem on Wednesday, Netanyahu said Israel ""deeply regrets"" civilian deaths, accusing Hamas of placing rockets and other military targets in crowded population centers. ""The responsibility for this tragedy belongs with Hamas,"" Netanyahu said. Apparent evidence of the Israeli argument came with the release of video from France 24 and India's NDTV that appears to show at least one rocket launcher located in a residential area. CNN reporters were blocked from reaching the area. Maen Areikat, the PLO ambassador to the United States, sought to play down the significance of the launcher. ""We don't know the circumstances of this particular rocket launcher,"" he told CNN. ""And if there has been incidents in which fighters from Palestinian factions fired at Israel from civilian populated centers, I think they were isolated centers. But to portray that this was the rule and not the exception is not a fair representation of what is happening in Gaza."" Hamdan went further, calling allegations of rocket fire from civilian areas nothing more than ""Israeli lies."" ""We challenge anyone to prove there were any rockets launched from civilian areas,"" he said. In fact, he said, Israel intentionally bombed civilians to punish Palestinians after strikes on rocket sites in open areas failed to achieve results. ""Israel is murdering innocent people on purpose,"" he said. CNN exclusive: Inside the mind of Hamas' political leader . Nobel laureate Wiesel: Hamas must stop using children as human shields .

"(CNN) -- Tyra Banks has gone from supermodel to super businesswoman. Tyra Banks shows off her real hair during an appearance on ""Larry King Live."" With her successful TV talk show, ""The Tyra Show,"" as well as her duties as host/creator and executive producer of ""America's Next Top Model, it would seem that Banks has scant room left on her plate. But she recently launched an online magazine called ""TYRA: Beauty Inside and Out."" Banks talked to CNN's Larry King about her career aspirations, the ""F"" word and the story behind her ""real hair."" The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: Are you looking to be Oprah? Is that it? Tyra Banks: Am I looking to be Oprah? Oh, Lord, if I tried, I would fail. King: But you're approaching it -- magazines, shows, specials. ... Banks: She is like the -- the Godmama, you know? There will never be another. There never has been and never will be another. But looking to be her -- no. I mean, I -- I started as a model, so there's a path that's quite different. King: The last time you were on you were dealing with the ""F"" word, meaning fat. You were fighting back. There [was] a nonflattering tabloid photo of you -- remember? In the swimsuit? Banks: Yes. King: You lost weight since then. Banks: Yes. King: Do you still feel an image pressure? Do you think -- you think like a fat person? Banks: I don't actually. You know, when I -- when I told the world to kiss my fat -- I can say ""ass"" right? King: Yes, you can. Banks: Yes. When I told the world to kiss my fat ass, I remained that size for two years. I maintained it with my ice cream and my salad with ranch and dressing and croutons and bacon bits. Like I -- I didn't look at myself even on television and think that I was too big or -- I don't know. I didn't -- it didn't connect. But since I have lost a lot of weight, and it started with the -- a weight loss challenge, actually at the top of this year. So I'm two years after ""kiss my fat ass."" King: When you look in the mirror, are you happy with the way you look? Banks: I've -- OK, I might be doing a little TMI -- do you know what TMI is? Too much information?  Watch Banks discuss her body image » . King: Well, give it to me anyway. Banks: I always feel great when I don't have clothes on. So at home, by myself, walking past ... King: Oh, we're glad you mean that now. Banks: Just too much information. But I always feel good that way. King: So you don't look at yourself nude and say, ""Oh, I don't like this."" You like it? Banks: No, unless the lighting is bad in the dressing room. But, no. I always feel good. But sometimes certain clothes, when I put them on and they don't fit the way that I would like them to, that's when I tend to get self-conscious. King: All right. You kicked off season five of your talk show by revealing your real hair. Banks: Let's talk about my hair right now. I know it's been a big mystery. And I was like it was an unsolved mystery, and I felt like I needed to solve this mystery. Like I've worn weaves and wigs and pieces and clip-ons and clip-outs and clip-downs and around since I was 17, 18, and I wanted to show the real me. I wanted to show the raw me, and I just got out of the shower -- beat the face first of course, you all -- and then came out of here -- on this stage, and this is me, you all. This is me. King: How did that feel? Banks: Oh my God, it felt so liberating. It felt so liberating. I have worn fake hair since I was 17 years old. King: This -- is this real? Banks: Yes. This is me. You want to feel my scalp? King: Yes. Banks: Yes? It's a little kinky in the scalp. That's like real black girl hair. But -- go -- go in there. Yes. That's -- yes. It's kinky. Exactly. My natural hair texture is very kinky. You felt my real hair texture. This is straightened. This part is straightened. This part is not, inside. But, I mean, hair for black women, we spend $9 billion a year on hair products -- black women do. So growing up as a young girl and seeing images in the media where they're saying that a certain type of hair is beautiful and yours isn't is very difficult for a black woman -- for black women and it's a -- it's a long, political thing that we can do a whole show about.

"(CNN)A hitchhiking feline in Florida has a 50-year-old truck owner to thank for her unusual rescue. Errand Frazier of Vero Beach wasn't quite sure what to do at first when he heard purring coming from his Chevy pickup, parked outside his house in late May. He couldn't see anything and wasn't sure exactly where it was, or even what type of animal was in there. So, he left an open can of cat food under one of the tires and set up a camera to try to get to the bottom of it. When he came back the next morning, the food was gone, but there was nothing on the video, he said. Thinking he had lost his mind, he went on an impromptu fishing trip to clear his head. When he got to the canal, the purring started again. Taking matters into his own hands, he reached for his toolbox, took out some sheet metal cutters and cut back the metal on the side of the truck bed. As he peeled it back, he spotted a kitten. ""I seen this little rascal peeking at me,"" Frazier recalled. ""I said, 'What in the world? You hitched a ride!'"" Frazier hadn't thought anything of slicing into his truck. He and his wife, Cindy, have a dog and two cats, and care deeply about animals. In the past, Frazier said, he has rescued stray kittens and brought them to the local Humane Society. Frazier could see that the cat was under the bed of his truck, lodged in the frame, and he couldn't get to it. Unsure what to do, he sought advice from the Humane Society of Vero Beach and Indian River County. Driving slowly, avoiding any bumps in the road, he reached the society's animal shelter and approached a staff member. ""I said, 'Ma'am, there's a kitten that hitchhiked from my home and I can't get it,"""" Frazier said. ""She said, 'Man, you did a job on your truck.'"" It was a team rescue. Humane Society staff member Tonya Martinez got under Frazier's truck to try to move the kitten forward, while staff member Maria Valencia put on gloves to catch the kitty and animal care supervisor Robyn Krajewski stood ready with a special carrier, said Janet Winikoff, director of education at the local Humane Society, who posted the story on CNN iReport. The shelter, which estimates the kitten was about 8 weeks old, named her Megan. A week after the rescue, the shelter invited Frazier for a reunion. The kitten purred in his arms. He took it as a sign. ""It was almost telling me, 'Thank you for saving my life,'"" he said. The cat has since been adopted by a family with two teenage girls, adoption counselor Sue Kelly said. After Winikoff shared the story of the rescue on the shelter's Facebook page this week, several people offered to help pay for the cost to repair Frazier's vehicle. On Friday, the Humane Society set up a special ""kitty truck fund"" to help Frazier. Winikoff said they didn't yet have an estimate for the repairs and any extra money would go into a special emergency fund in Frazier's name to help other animals in similar situations. Frazier's wife, Cindy, said they were touched by the outpouring of support. The truck is their only vehicle. She said it didn't cross their mind to look into repairing it because she knew they couldn't afford it. Both have disabilities; Errand Frazier has macular degeneration, but still has the ability to drive during the day. On Friday, the couple said they weren't worried about the truck and hoped people would just donate to the humane society to help other animals. ""We really never expected all of this, to be honest, but God does blessings every day,"" Cindy Frazier said. ""That's the reason that little kitten just showed up here -- because God knew we would do whatever we needed to do to make sure that kitten was safe.""

"A spokesman for eBay said Sunday that the company has removed items described as Holocaust memorabilia from its online auction site. The removal comes after an investigation by Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper, which reported that a uniform and a pair of shoes purportedly belonging to concentration camp victims and yellow Star of David armbands were among items offered on the site. ""We are very sorry that these items have been listed on eBay and we are removing them,"" eBay spokesman Steve Heywood said. ""We don't allow listings of this nature, and dedicate thousands of staff to policing our site and use the latest technology to detect items that shouldn't be for sale. We very much regret that we didn't live up to our own standards. We have made a donation to charity to reflect our concern."" Recounting the nightmares of the Holocaust . The Mail reported later Sunday that 30 items had been removed from eBay, and that the company had pledged to give 25,000 pounds ($40,000) to charity. The newspaper said its investigation had uncovered a number of Holcaust-related items for sale on the site, including a uniform that purportedly belonged to a Polish baker who died in Auschwitz, on sale for 11,200 pounds ($17,900). Seller Viktor Kempf described himself to The Mail as a historian. ""I have had criticism in the past and I find it upsetting,"" he said, according to the newspaper. ""I don't want people to think I'm just doing it for the money. These periods in history are horrific, nobody should ever forget them."" EBay's offensive material policy lists a series of restrictions and guidelines tied to Nazi-related items, but the policy allows some ""historical items"" to be sold, such as currency and stamps showing Nazi postmarks. The site generally makes 10% of the final sale price of item, in addition to possible listing fees. ""It is outrageous, disgusting and disrespectful that eBay sought to profit from the sale of artifacts related to the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews,"" Robert Singer, CEO of the World Jewish Congress, said in a written statement.

"His name hints of an unconventional origin and his next journey reveals his desire in doing things ""differently"": . So differently that Joseph Michael Liu Kai-Tsu Roqueni, 32, plans to run barefoot from Canada to Argentina in 18 months. The ""Chexican"" -- as he describes himself because of his Chinese, Mexican and Canadian roots -- departed Montreal on July 2 and will cross 14 countries all the way down to Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, known as the southernmost city in the world. Kai-Tsu's strategy is to run about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) or two-and-a-half hours -- whichever comes first -- twice a day. He will run barefoot because ""no one has else done it,"" it's cheaper and he won't have to carry lots of pairs of running shoes with him. Overall, Joseph's feet will cover 19,000 kilometers (about 11,806 miles) of roads, a distance nearly 7,000 kilometers (4,349 miles) greater than the Earth's diameter. Kai-Tsu's also plans to raise funds for an organization to promote education of each country that he runs across. For now, he has picked an organization in Canada and Mexico. His inspiration: Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara's motorcycle journey across South America and the case of a Uruguayan rugby team stranded in the mountains for over two months after their plane crashed in the Chilean Andes. But his ""true guru"" is the Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner, who has climbed all 14 ""eight-thousanders"" peaks (mountains over 8,000 meters or 26,000 feet above sea level) without oxygen. ""I thought my friends didn't believe me"" Kai-Tsu has just graduated from Concordia University in Montreal where he obtained an Industrial Engineering degree. He was part of the university's cross-country running club. However, not even his running teammates, he says, believed he was going to start the adventure. ""They tell me I'm crazy and I thought my friends didn't believe me,"" he told CNNMéxico.com days before starting his adventure. His family supports him, though his dad remains ""concerned,"" even though Kai-Tsu has done his best to reassure him. Kai-Tsu compares the skeptics of his journey to those who doubted Christopher Columbus' plan to sail across the Atlantic. ""It is like telling Columbus: 'You are crazy, the Earth is flat and your boat will drop off' -- he would never have sailed and discovered that the Earth is round."" Why did he ""hang up the sneakers?"" Kai-Tsu has been training for over a year. To prepare himself -- ""because the mechanics are different,"" -- he says, he has run barefoot on almost all the surfaces he will find along the road and during all his training sessions, he wore the backpack he will carry with him through the journey. Before he started training, he read about the Tarahumara tribe, the history of human exploration and the minimalistic running trend, that according to Mexican marathon runner German Silva, could be ""a response in our society where there's so much of everything."" Kai-Tsu's barefoot training has been gradual and so far, the longest distance he has run is 20 kilometers (a little over 12 miles,), with four of those (2.48 miles) in the snow. According to Silva, the most harmful surfaces for the human feet are pavement or running tracks, and for this reason Kai-Tsu will try to avoid paved roads. He is carrying only four pairs of sandals whose soles are designed specially for running and he plans to wear them when his feet become sensitive. Kai-Tsu hasn't followed a specific diet since he will eat ""what I can find"" along the way. He will try to consume chia seeds, a food source that ""contains 21% protein, a level markedly greater than other nutritional grains such as wheat, corn, rice, oats, barley, and amaranth,"" according to the European Food Safety Authority. His sponsors will also provide him with granola bars and vegetable supplements. ""No one will follow me."" He picked this journey because he wants to be different from other adventurers such as Jesper Olsen, who has also run around the world. The difference: he has worn his running shoes and a support team escorted him along his treks. Unlike Olsen, ""no one will follow me,"" Kai-Tsu said. His route has been based on the seasons so he doesn't run during winter. He knows where he will be every day, so in December he plans to be in Central America, but he refrains from giving more dates and places because he doesn't know what could happen along the way. He is aware of the risks, from robberies to encounters with wild animals. He is only carrying a first aid kit and an emergency button to be rescued by helicopter if needed, and although Kai-Tsu tries not to think about it, he says that if something does happen to him, he will go back to Canada to be treated and then he'll resume his journey. ""I will not give up easily,"" he insisted.

"(CNN)  -- The Brazilian military said late Friday it is calling off the search for bodies of passengers and crew from the Air France plane that crashed into the Atlantic earlier this month. Wreckage from Flight 447 spotted by search teams in the Atlantic last week. It was unlikely that any more bodies would be found, the military said. So far, search teams have found 51 of the 228 people who died when Air France Flight 447 plunged into the sea June 1, according to the military. They have also found more than 600 parts and structural components of the plane, along with luggage, the military said. The bodies were handed to Brazilian authorities for identification while the debris and luggage were given to French aviation investigators, the military said. In the 26 days of the search operation, the Brazilian air force used 12 planes along with aircraft from France, the United States and Spain, the military said. The Brazilian navy used 11 ships. Ships remain in the search area hundreds of miles northeast of Brazil in an effort to find the flight data recorders, the Brazilian military said. Last week investigators said they were running out of time to find the recorders which could prove crucial to working out what caused the disaster. Officials remain in the dark about what caused the airliner to plunge into the sea off the coast of Brazil. The wreckage is believed to be about 15,000 feet (4,500 meters) deep, amid underwater mountains and mixed in with tons of sea trash. A French submarine and other vessels are searching for black boxes by attempting to trace their locator beacons, which send out acoustic pulses, or ""pings,"" to searchers. The U.S. Navy has contributed two high-tech acoustic devices -- known as towed pinger locators -- which have been attached to French tug boats and can search to a maximum depth of 20,000ft (6,100 meters). The firm which makes the recorders, Honeywell Aerospace, has told CNN it has a 100 percent recovery record from air accidents. Honeywell said it was hard to estimate how much battery life the locator beacon on the recorders had, as it depended on the conditions, but it is typically around 30 days. One recorder taped radio transmissions and sounds in the cockpit, such as the pilot's voices and engine noises. Sounds of interest could be engine noise, stall warnings, landing gear extension and retraction, and other clicks and pops. From these sounds engine revs per minute, system failures, speed and the time at which certain events occurred could often be determined, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. CNN's Claudia Dominguez in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Brazilian military: Unlikely that any more bodies would be found .

"A judge in Saudi Arabia has recommended that imprisoned blogger Raif Badawi go before a high court on a charge of apostasy, which would carry the death penalty upon conviction, according to Badawi's wife. Ensaf Haidar initially told CNN on Wednesday that her husband had been sentenced to death. She later clarified to CNN that a judge has recommended he be tried for denouncing Islam, or apostasy. Apostasy carries the death penalty in Saudi Arabia, according to Amnesty International. In July, a Jeddah criminal court found Badawi, who has been in prison since June 2012, guilty of insulting Islam through his Free Saudi Liberals website and in television comments. Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes. His lawyer appealed the decision. Badawi's legal troubles started shortly after he started the Free Saudi Liberals website in 2008. He was detained for one day and questioned about the site. Some clerics even branded him an unbeliever and apostate. Human rights groups accuse Saudi authorities of targeting activists through the courts and travel bans. Amnesty International has said Badawi's ""is clear case of intimidation against him and others who seek to engage in open debates about the issues that Saudi Arabians face in their daily lives.""

"A crowd estimated at more than 10,000 people marched silently on a bitterly cold day through downtown Istanbul Thursday to commemorate the five year anniversary of the murder of an ethnic Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. They walked carrying a sea of black signs declaring ""We are all Hrant, we are all Armenian,"" written in Turkish and Armenian. Police, who put the crowd estimate at 10,000 or more, blocked off traffic as the crowds moved towards the offices of the Armenian language Agos newspaper. On January 19, 2007, Dink, the newspaper's editor in chief, was gunned down in broad daylight on the sidewalk outside the newspaper's offices. Dink, in the opinion of observers, had been an eloquent spokesman for Turkey's tiny minority of Armenians. A 17-year-old Turkish ultra nationalist soccer player was caught with the murder weapon and later convicted of the killing. But on Tuesday an Istanbul court attracted condemnation from members of the Dink family as well as human rights groups when 19 suspected accomplices in the murder where all acquitted of charges of being members of  a terrorist organization that plotted the assassination. ""The verdict was not only a travesty of justice, it shows our justice system is simply political and does not work,"" said newspaper columnist Asli Aydintasbas, as she marched along with her mother and thousands of others up Istanbul's Cumhuriyet Caddesi, the broad boulevard where Dink was shot dead. ""So many journalists are in jail charged with terrorism only because of their writing,"" Aydintasbas added, ""whereas the actual guys who killed a journalist and who had clear connections with state officials... they're not charged with terrorism. Some are even let go."" According to the Turkish Journalists Union there are currently more than 90 media workers behind bars, many of them facing charges of alleged membership in terrorist organizations and coup plots to overthrow the government. A Parliament member from Turkey's ruling party added to the chorus of criticism Thursday in a newspaper column describing the trial as a ""disgrace."" ""Apart from offending our civic conscience and eroding our limited trust in justice in this country, Tuesday's verdict is also an insult to this nation's intelligence,"" wrote lawmaker Suat Kiniklioglu in the English-language Today's Zaman.  ""Despite the clear evidence that confirms links with state officials both before and after Hrant's murder, it is clear that the deep state wants this link to be covered up."" ""Deep state"" is the term many Turks use to refer to alleged criminal networks within security forces and the government bureaucracy. Many members of the crowd of thousands carrying portraits of Dink on Thursday chanted ""fascist state."" Before his murder Dink was on trial for ""insulting Turkishness"" because he referred to the World War I-era massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenian as genocide. The Turkish government vehemently rejects using that term to refer to that bloody chapter of history. But while attracting the anger of Turkish ultra-nationalists, Dink was also outspoken in his defense of freedom of speech.  Three months before his murder, Dink gave an interview to U.S. National Public Radio, in which he argued against a proposed law in France to make the denial of the Armenian genocide a crime. ""Those who use this Armenian issue as a political tool are massacring my people over and over again,"" Dink said. In that October 2006 interview, Dink also warned that he had received multiple death threats. According to a prosecutor's indictment, within days of Dink's shooting, the chief murder suspect Ogun Samast, was caught by police in possession of the murder weapon and the white knit hat that he was filmed wearing by a security camera, positioned on the street where Dink was killed. After he was detained, several Turkish police officers filmed themselves treating Samast like a hero.  A video that was later widely re-broadcast on Turkish television networks showed the officers posing alongside Samast, after positioning him prominently in front of a Turkish flag.","Hrant Dink was gunned down outside his newspaper in 2007 .

"A prosecuting attorney greeted the jury in the George Zimmerman trial Monday with a quote full of expletives, while his adversary decided it was appropriate to tell jurors a knock-knock joke. And that was just the beginning of opening statements in Zimmerman's long-anticipated murder trial. In a case that has ignited national debate about gun laws and race relations, Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, is accused of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012 in Sanford, Florida. Prosecutor John Guy's first words to the six-woman jury may have raised a few eyebrows. ""Good morning. 'F*****g punks, these a******s all get away,'"" Guy quoted Zimmerman. ""These were the words in this grown man's mouth as he followed this boy that he didn't know. Those were his words, not mine."" Zimmerman, Guy said, ""got out of his car with a pistol and two flashlights to follow Trayvon Benjamin Martin, who was walking home from a 7-Eleven, armed"" with a fruit drink and a bag of candy. Eventually the two became entangled on the ground in a fight. A witness has said Martin was on top of Zimmerman, Guy said. ""The defendant claims that while Trayvon Martin was on top of him, he said, 'you are going to die tonight,'"" said Guy. ""Nobody heard that."" Guy told jurors that no witnesses saw what happened the night of the shooting from beginning to end. Witnesses only saw ""slices"" of what happened, he said. ""We are confident that at the end of this trial you will know in your head, in your heart, in your stomach that George Zimmerman did not shoot Trayvon Martin because he had to,"" Guy said. ""He shot him for the worst of all reasons, because he wanted to."" Fast facts: Trayvon Martin shooting . In the first day of testimony, jurors heard witnesses recount Martin's trip to the convenience store, Zimmerman's call complaining about a suspicious person walking through his neighborhood before Martin's killing, and a call from the previous August, in which Zimmerman reported an alleged burglary to police. Proceedings ended for the day when defense attorney Mark O'Mara objected to the earlier call, which prosecutors argued was necessary to explain Zimmerman's remark about burglars who ""get away."" The Martin family sat watching the proceedings behind State Attorney Angela Corey. Before witness testimony began, Judge Debra Nelson denied a defense request that Martin's father, Tracy Martin, leave the courtroom. Tracy Martin is a potential witness, and potential witnesses can be forced to sit outside of the courtroom to keep their testimony from being tainted by other witnesses. But the next-of-kin of victims are allowed to remain in court even if they're expected to testify. O'Mara also accused Tracy Martin of using an obscenity toward a friend of Zimmerman's while holding the door for him during a hearing two weeks ago. The friend, Timothy Tucholski, testified that he hadn't wanted to make an issue of it before. ""I wasn't planning on coming up here. I don't want to be sitting here,"" he said. But Nelson denied the request, and Martin remained in court -- but Zimmerman's parents were covered by the rule regarding potential witnesses and had to sit outside, as did Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Martin's parents. At one point, Martin's father began crying as Guy detailed how officers tried to save his son's life. Zimmerman has mostly stared straight ahead without any signs of emotion. Following Guy's statement, defense attorney Don West came forward to woo the jury. As he began, he told a knock-knock joke. But it failed to win a laugh. ""Knock knock. Who's there? George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman who? Good, you're on the jury,"" he said. Later, West apologized. ""No more bad jokes, I promise that,"" he told jurors. ""I was convinced it was the delivery."" West quickly got on with the business of making his case: that Zimmerman was forced to act in self-defense to save his own life. ""The evidence will show this is a sad case; no monsters here. ... George Zimmerman is not guilty of murder. He shot Trayvon Martin after he was viciously attacked."" With the help of PowerPoint visuals, West spent hours hammering home his argument. He broke down Zimmerman's 911 call in which he first reported seeing Martin and told about following him. ""Little did George Zimmerman know at the time in less than 10 minutes from him first seeing Travyon Martin that he, George Zimmerman, would be suckered punched in the face, have his head pounded on concrete and wind up shooting and tragically killing Trayvon Martin,"" West told jurors. West also deconstructed a 911 call a neighbor made, in which it is possible to hear screams and a shot in the background that West said was the sound of the fatal bullet. As the dramatic recording audio filled the courtroom, Zimmerman showed no emotion. Martin's mother left the courtroom. ""At the moment this actually became physical was that Trayvon Martin -- I will use my words -- that Trayvon Martin decided to confront George Zimmerman,"" West said. ""That instead of going home. He had plenty of time. This is, what, 60 or 70 yards. Plenty of time. He could've gone back and forth four or five times."" West quoted a witness named John Good who described the fight. ""He called it a 'ground and pound' by Martin, who he said was on top of Zimmerman, beating him."" ""He saw enough that this was serious,"" West said. Zimmerman cried out for help, looked at Good and said, ""help me."" But the beating continued while Good went inside his home to call 911, West said. There was a shot. Shortly afterward, according to West, Zimmerman said Martin ""was beating me up, and I shot him."" West also disputed the prosecution's claim that Martin was unarmed. ""Travyon Martin armed himself with the concrete sidewalk and used it to smash George Zimmerman's head,"" said West. ""No different than if he picked up a brick or smashed his head against a wall. That is a deadly weapon."" West showed jurors photos taken of Zimmerman after the fight. ""What you can really see in these pictures that you will have in evidence are the lumps,"" West said. ""The big knots on each side of his head. Consistent with having his head slammed into concrete."" All-female jury to try Zimmerman . Among the first prosecution witnessed called was the 911 dispatcher who took Zimmerman's call before the shooting. Seat Noffke testified that he was trained to give general commands instead of direct orders to people. When Zimmerman said he was following Martin, Noffke told him, ""Okay we don't need you to do that."" Noffke told the prosecutor he's liable for any direct orders he gives someone. On cross-examination, defense attorney O'Mara pointed out that Noffke asked Zimmerman, ""Which way is he running?"" ""If you tell somebody twice to let you know if the person that they're concerned about is doing anything else -- do you think they're going to keep their eye on them?"" asked O'Mara. ""I can't answer that,"" said Noffke. ""You did tell him twice to let you know if that guy did anything else,"" said O'Mara. ""Yes sir,"" said Noffke. Noffke went on to say he only wanted a location of the suspect for officers and that he never told Zimmerman to follow or keep his eye on Martin. Shortly before court got under way, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, spoke to reporters, asking people to ""pray for me and my family because I don't want any other mother to experience what I'm going through now."" Judge: No state expert testimony on 911 calls . Martin was black, and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. In a CNN poll released Monday morning, 62% of respondents say the charges against Zimmerman are probably or definitely true.","Defense lawyer apologizes for telling joke during opening statements .

"(CNN) -- Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said Saturday he will give in to a rebel demand that he impose Islamic law, or sharia, in an effort to halt fighting between Somali forces and Islamic insurgents. President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed  says sharia law in Somalia will not be strict. However, Ahmed told a news conference he won't agree to a strict interpretation of the law, which forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television. The president, speaking at his palace in the capital, Mogadishu, said local elders and religious leaders, acting as liaisons with the militants, brought him a message saying the rebels wanted a truce in the two-year-old fighting. He also asked African peacekeepers to stand down. Ahmed, who was elected January 31, said he would ask the AU contingent to leave once there is a solid political solution to the conflict. More than 40,000 Somalis have returned to abandoned neighborhoods in Mogadishu over the past six weeks, despite some of the heaviest fighting in months, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday. They are part of the more than a million residents who have been displaced by fighting in Somalia, including 100,000 who fled to neighboring countries last year alone, according to the United Nations. Ethiopian troops entered the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopians ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year. Ethiopia's action had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. But various Islamist groups -- including al-Shabab, which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government.

"The U.S. Army has appointed a two-star general to investigate how and why Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl left his base in Afghanistan, resulting in his capture, a senior defense official said Saturday. Bergdahl spent five years in captivity until his release May 31, in exchange for five Taliban figures being held at a U.S. military detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Bergdahl, 28, returned to the United States -- specifically to an Army medical facility in San Antonio, Texas -- early Friday. The investigating officer looking into the circumstances surrounding how Bergdahl went missing is expected to begin working on the case next week, though that doesn't necessarily signal anything about when the sergeant will undergo formal questioning. The senior defense official declined to name the general who will investigate until there is a formal announcement. Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official recently told CNN. Bergdahl arrived in San Antonio from a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, where he'd been recuperating since his release May 31 in exchange for five Taliban figures held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Officials have described Bergdahl's condition as stable. With Qatar as the broker, the United States struck a deal with the Taliban to free Bergdahl. The Obama administration didn't tell Congress of the releases. Under law, the White House has to give a 30-day notice to Capitol Hill before any terrorists are transferred from Guantanamo. Believing that his health was deteriorating, the administration said it acted quickly to save his life. U.S. special operations forces recovered Bergdahl without incident on May 31 at a helicopter pickup point in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan.","Source: A two-star general has been appointed to investigate Bowe Bergdahl's disappearance .

"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times? Good grief, no one should ever be fooled three times. But that's exactly what will happen to the Senate Intelligence Committee -- and the American people -- unless President Barack Obama puts a leash on an unchecked CIA.  He now must stop it from taking any more steps to try to hide its record of torture, secret prisons and the kidnapping program known as extraordinary rendition. Under the leadership of Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the committee conducted a five-year investigation into the CIA's use of torture between 2001 and 2006. Senators and their staff members reviewed more than 3 million pages of CIA documents, resulting in a report of more than 6,000 pages. The committee voted Thursday to submit its report on torture to the executive branch for a declassification review and then public release. One of the very few conclusions of the report that will be made public is that the CIA repeatedly misled Congress, the White House and the Justice Department on the facts of the torture program. An entire section of the report is dedicated to CIA falsehoods, presumably including lies to the very committee charged with overseeing the CIA. Fool the Senate once, shame on the CIA. After nearly four years of investigating, the committee voted in December 2012 to adopt the report but delayed any vote on declassifying it until the CIA -- the agency that the committee had just concluded had lied to Congress and carried out all of the illegal conduct in the report -- had 60 days to review the report. Well, 60 days turned into more than six months as the CIA reportedly found almost no factual errors in the report but nonetheless wrote a couple hundred pages reportedly asserting the efficacy of the program and attacking the report's methodology. The agency, however, wasn't done. It then ran a whisper campaign among reporters to disparage the Senate report. The CIA campaign to hide the truth didn't just stop with foot dragging or writing counter-reports. It reportedly went as far as spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee staff's use of computers dedicated for their exclusive use. Feinstein has characterized the reported incidents as possibly violating the constitutional separation of powers principle, the Fourth Amendment, a criminal computer fraud statute and an executive order banning the CIA from spying domestically. The CIA must be held responsible for any laws broken, but it is certainly reasonable  to ask why the Senate Intelligence Committee or the White House ever let the agency get its controlling hands on the report in the first place. Fool the Senate twice, shame on the Senate. With the committee poised to vote to submit the torture report for a declassification review and then public release, it is worth asking: Will the Senate risk getting fooled by the CIA a third time? CIA Director John Brennan has promised to play nice, saying that if sent the Senate torture report yet again, the CIA would ""carry out the review expeditiously."" Yes, let's again entrust the report to the agency that broke the law on torture and was so brazen that until this month, its acting CIA general counsel was a lawyer named 1,600 times in the torture report. Only a fool would be fooled three times. Feinstein should insist -- and Obama should agree -- that the White House itself conduct the declassification review. Furthermore, only White House officials who had no role in any of the banned practices described in the report should be involved in the review, and the CIA should be consulted only as needed -- with only CIA officials untainted by torture looped in. By law, the president has authority to declassify information, and he surely has the authority to decide the process for declassifying this landmark report. The CIA should never have had a torture program, never should have lied about what it was doing and never should have been given broad authority to review the Senate oversight report. Obama cannot now hand the agency a black-out pen to continue to hide the horrors it inflicted around the globe and the harm it caused to our American values. It's time for someone other than the CIA to decide what all Americans can know about its wrongs. Fooled twice, yes. Let's not be fooled again.

"Kevin Clash, the puppeteer who provides the voice of Elmo on ""Sesame Street,"" resigned Tuesday after a man filed a lawsuit accusing him of conducting an underage sexual relationship. The lawsuit was filed in a New York court Tuesday, a week after another accuser recanted his claim that Clash, now 52, engaged him in underage sex. ""I am resigning from Sesame Workshop with a very heavy heart,"" Clash said in a written statement Tuesday. ""I have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization. Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately."" The Sesame Workshop also issued a statement announcing his resignation. ""This is a sad day for Sesame Street,"" it said. When heroes disappoint our kids . In the lawsuit, Cecil Singleton alleged that Clash ""persuaded, induced, coerced or enticed"" him to meet for sexual encounters when he was 15 years old. ""Kevin Clash preyed on vulnerable teenage boys, like Cecil Singleton, to satisfy his depraved sexual interests,"" attorney Jeff Herman said. ""By coming forward now, Cecil hopes to spare the lives of others like him and to begin his own healing process."" The suit seeks $5 million in damages from Clash, alleging that Singleton ""suffered severe injuries, including but not limited to mental, psychological and emotional trauma."" The earlier accuser -- who never filed a lawsuit  -- issued a statement through a lawyer last week saying he ""wants it to be known that his sexual relationship with Mr. Clash was an adult consensual relationship."" The man, now 23, had told Sesame Workshop in June that he started a relationship with Clash as a teenager, according to the workshop, which announced that a thorough investigation found ""the allegation of underage conduct to be unsubstantiated."" When the first accusation emerged, Clash acknowledged a relationship between ""two consenting adults"" but said the man otherwise was making a ""false and defamatory allegation."" ""I am a gay man,"" Clash said in a statement. ""I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter."" From the archives: Surprising stories behind 20 Muppet characters . The lawsuit alleged that Singleton, then 15, began communicating with Clash when he called a gay chat line seeking friends in 2003. ""During these telephone calls, Kevin Clash persuaded, induced, coerced or enticed Cecil Singleton to meet him for sexual encounters,"" the complaint said. Clash ""groomed Cecil and gained his trust by, among other things, taking him to nice dinners and giving him money,"" the suit said. The two met ""on numerous occasions over a period of years"" and engaged in sexual activity, the suit said. Clash is the high-pitched voice of the iconic furry red Elmo, whom he's been playing since 1984, winning Emmy Awards along the way. He was the third Muppeteer to take on the role. Clash also was Sesame Street's senior Muppet coordinator and Muppet captain, the ""Sesame Street"" website says. A documentary, ""Being Elmo,"" focused on his story.

"An Argentinian court Thursday found two former dictators guilty of stealing dozens of babies during the country's dirty war. Jorge Rafael Videla, who ruled as a dictator between 1976 to 1981, was sentenced to 50 years in prison. Gen. Reynaldo Benito Bignone, who ruled the country from June 1982 until the nation's return to democracy in December 1983, was sentenced to 15 years in prison. They were the two most high-profile defendants found guilty Thursday of systematically stealing babies from political prisoners and giving them new identities. Baby-stealing trial in Argentina . ""It was the worst, the most perverse of the dictatorship, I think, what they did with us,"" said Francisco Madariaga Quintela, 35, one of the stolen babies who was reunited with his father in 2010. ""It was a torture prolonged through time, for the grandmothers searching, for family members, everyone."" Observers packed the courtroom Thursday and cheered when a judge read the verdict for Videla. Afterward, outside the courthouse, family members of the disappeared told CNN affiliate Canal 7 that they were satisfied with the verdict. ""It was what we were asking for. We never asked for revenge. We never hated. We never asked for anything more than justice, and we have been fighting for 36 years,"" one father said. The dictators and their officers were on trial for being the ""presumed authors of the crimes of theft, retention and hiding of minors, as well as replacing their identities,"" according to a statement from the country's judiciary. Specifically, they were tried for the stealing of 34 babies from their parents, the court said. During the trial, Videla said children may have been kidnapped, but he said that there was no order or systematic plan. Videla, who was among the coup leaders who overthrew then-President Isabel Martinez de Peron in March 1976, was previously convicted in 2010 of human rights abuses during his rule and is currently serving a life sentence in prison. Former dictator sentenced to life . Bignone was sentenced in 2009 to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people. The accusations stem from the country's ""Dirty War"" from 1976 to 1983. During those years of military dictatorship, up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers. Mariana Zaffaroni Islas, who was reunited with her family in 1993, told Argentina's state-run Telam news agency that the verdict was significant for all Argentinians. ""For any citizen who lives in a country where actions like this do not remain unpunished with the passage of time, it represents a guarantee that justice is done,"" she said.","The crimes were ""the most perverse of the dictatorship,"" one victim says .

"Pangkalan Bun, Indonesia (CNN)A 10-minute warning sounds and everyone jumps into action. More bodies are on the way. Red Cross and hospital workers run to the front of the hospital in Pangkalan Bun, not even certain how many victims are coming. Sirens then announce the arrival of the remains of two innocent souls lost on AirAsia Flight QZ8501. Unfortunately, this little town in Indonesia's central Kalimantan Province has become the focal point for the recovery of bodies and debris from the airliner, which failed to complete its journey from Surabaya, the country's second-biggest city, to Singapore on Sunday. Orange body bags are loaded onto gurneys and rushed to a separate, private wing of the hospital. The unmistakeable smell of death lingers long after the victims have passed. Their bodies are then cleaned and treated with chemicals to preserve them. It must be a gruesome and heartbreaking job. Identification . This is where the initial identification effort begins. Hospital staff assess gender, height, identifying marks and any clothing. But as time passes, the most obvious test -- facial recognition -- becomes increasingly difficult. ""Because they have been in the water some days, the bodies are bloated, but otherwise intact,"" says Suyuti Syamsul, director at the Sultan Imanuddin Hospital. He's been at the hospital 24 hours a day, he tells CNN, to ensure the bodies are afforded the respect they deserve. This hospital is not equipped for a tragedy on this scale. They usually have three morticians. They now have 40 staff and 20 volunteers focused on treating the bodies. The facility's other patients look on at the growing tragedy that has unfolded in this small town. Temporary caskets are being hastily made, some literally around the corner from where the bodies are being prepared. Respect . Syamsul says they will have 162 coffins, one for each victim of the doomed flight. He says they are paying the victims every respect possible. Representatives of six different religions pray over the bodies before they leave. The victim's religion may not be known, but customs must still be observed. ""Their time on earth is over,"" says Pastor Sirdjon Palace. ""So many of our prayers are for the family. We ask God to receive their bodies and give the families strength."" A further six bodies arrived at Sultan Imanuddin hospital throughout Friday. Suyuti says 14 bodies have now come through the hospital so far. As the victims' remains are transported out by ambulance to be flown to Surabaya -- for formal identification by distraught families -- the hospital team takes a breath but just for a moment. The search, to the south of Pangkalan Bun, is slow going, hampered by rough seas, which complicate the job done by divers. With only ten victims recovered from the Java sea so far, there remain many more that will come through these gates, to be tended to by the small but dedicated group of workers here. On standby 24 hours a day, just waiting for the next ten-minute warning.","Red Cross and hospital workers in Pangkalan Bun, Indonesia receive bodies from downed airliner .

"Ten states are being granted waivers to free them from some requirements of the No Child Left Behind education reform law, with President Barack Obama explaining Thursday that the move aims to ""combine greater freedom with greater accountability."" Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Tennessee are the first of what could be many more states that will no longer have to meet 2014 targets set by the law. In exchange for that flexibility, those states ""have agreed to raise standards, improve accountability, and undertake essential reforms to improve teacher effectiveness,"" the White House said in a statement Thursday morning. Obama elaborated on the rationale for the decision later in the day, speaking at a White House event attended by teachers and school superintendents. He stressed that his administration remains committed to the overarching goals of raising standards and closing the achievement gap in the nation's public schools. At the same time, ""We determined we need a different approach"" than what was prescribed by the landmark legislation. ""We've offered every state the same deal: We've said, if you're willing to set higher, more honest standards then we're going to give you the flexibility to meet those standards,"" Obama said. Each of those states granted waivers Thursday offered different approaches. Massachusetts, for instance, set a goal to slash its number of underperfoming students by half within six years; Colorado is setting up a comprehensive online database of assessment measures, among other steps; and New Jersey is developing an ""early warning"" system in an effort to prevent students from dropping out of school. New Mexico also requested such flexibility from the No Child Left Behind law, and the Obama administration is working closely with that state. Another 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia also have indicated plans to seek such flexibility, according to the White House. ""This is good news for our kids, it's good news for our country,"" the president said of the waivers, adding that one approach may work well in one part of the country while another may better suit another place. ""If we're serious about seeing our children reach their full potential, the best ideas aren't just going to come from here in Washington."" John Kline, R-Minnesota, and Duncan Hunter, R-California, sent a joint letter last summer to Education Secretary Arne Duncan calling the then prospect of allowing waivers a ""cause for concern."" ""Issuing new demands in exchange for relief could result in greater regulations and confusion for schools and less transparency for parents,"" the two House Education and the Workforce Committee members wrote. ""Additionally, the proposal raises questions about the department's legal authority to grant constitutional waivers in exchange for reforms not authorized by Congress."" And last month, Kline again criticized Obama for having ""the audacity to circumvent the people's elected representatives by granting No Child Left Behind waivers with special strings attached,"" according to a press release from his office. Still, the decision was cheered by leaders from several states -- many of them led by Republican governors -- who successfully obtained waivers, as well as the country's largest teacher's union. Florida Education Commissioner Gerard Robinson, for instance, said the change was needed, because having federal accountability measures ""overlaying"" state ones was ""confusing."" Georgia State School Superintendent John Barge described the waiver for his state as ""wonderful news for Georgia's students, educators and parents. No longer will we be bound by the narrow definitions of success found in No Child Left Behind."" And Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who was President George W. Bush's director of the Office of Management and Budget when the law was passed, described No Child Left Behind as ""an important step forward, but it needed additional flexibility that Congress hasn't yet provided."" ""The waiver will make for a fairer system and one that focuses on what matters most: getting the whole system to perform better in terms of student learning,"" he said in a statement. The president of the National Education Association, which represents 3.2 million teachers and administrators and has endorsed Obama's re-election bid, lauded those states granted waivers who ""have committed to working with teachers, parents and other community stakeholders to implement changes designed to better support students."" At the same time, union President Dennis Van Roekel described the waivers as a temporary move as he pushed for passage of more ""comprehensive"" reform. Bush signed No Child Left Behind into law in 2001. One of the bipartisan bill's sponsors was the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts. The law included a focus on measuring student outcomes, largely based on standardized test results. Some supporters say it has helped close an achievement gap between disadvantaged students and others. But the law is a source of controversy, with opponents arguing it is turning classrooms into test preparation centers, taking time away from subjects that aren't tested, and potentially contributing to cheating scandals. Secretary Duncan says the law drives down standards, weakens accountability, causes narrowing of the curriculum and labels too many schools as failing, the White House said in its news release. ""Moreover, the law mandates unworkable remedies at the federal level instead of allowing local educators to make spending decisions,"" it said. The law has been in need of reauthorization since 2007, and the president has been critical of the lack of congressional action on the matter in recent years. Last September, the Obama administration announced that states could apply for waivers from some provisions of the law if they meet other federal mandates. To get the waivers, states had to adopt and have a plan to implement ""college and career-ready standards,"" the White House said.  ""They must also create comprehensive systems of teacher and principal development, evaluation and support that include factors beyond test scores, such as principal observation, peer review, student work, or parent and student feedback."" Based on standards set by the existing law, more schools were listed as failing last year than in any previous year since the law's passage. About 48% of schools did not make what's called ""adequate yearly progress"" in 2011, up from 39% in 2010, according to the nonprofit Center on Education Policy. In his remarks Thursday, Obama expressed confidence that the academic performance of the nation's students would improve using a more flexible approach -- though he also emphasized that any change won't be instantaneous. ""This is not a one-year project, this isn't a two-year project,"" he said. ""This is going to take some time, but we can get it done.""","A GOP lawmaker has said the waivers wrongly ""circumvent"" Congress .

"Shortly before she and her family went into hiding, Anne Frank gave some of her toys to a friend for safekeeping -- a tin of marbles, a tea set and a book.

The world learned the harrowing tale in Anne's own words, written in her now widely read diary. Now, some 70 years later, Frank's colorful marbles have been rediscovered and will go on display for the first time at a World War II exhibition in Rotterdam. ""Anne gave these to her friend for safe-keeping,"" Teresien da Silva, head of collections at the Anne Frank House museum, told CNN. ""She kept them for when Anne returned, but Anne did not return."" Kept in a box . Frank's account of hiding in Amsterdam during World War II, published posthumously in English as ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl,"" has moved millions of readers across the decades. The young girl, with her parents and sister Margot, had moved into a concealed apartment on July 6, 1942 -- the ""Secret Annexe"" on the Prinsengracht Canal. Only a small circle of helpers knew of their whereabouts, and the family lived in fear of being discovered. They were betrayed, arrested and deported in August 1944. Frank died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen just weeks before the Nazi concentration camp was liberated in 1945. Kupers had kept the belongings, only finding them decades later when moving just over a year ago. ""She discovered she had the marbles somewhere at home in the attic,"" da Silva said. ""She immediately contacted us. ... We were thrilled that the marbles survived and had been kept. She decided to give everything to the Anne Frank House -- the book, the tea set and the marbles."" Treasured marbles . The Anne Frank House Museum has already displayed the book, which Frank received for her 13th birthday, as well as the tea set, da Silva said. ""But we decided to present the marbles for the first time in Rotterdam,"" she said. The marbles, alongside 99 other objects, make up the exhibition The Second World War in 100 Objects, which opens to the public this week. Dutch king Willem-Alexander will open the exhibition Tuesday. Da Silva said Frank was one of many Jewish children who gave away their toys before going into hiding or being deported. ""For children during that time, marbles were a treasure. They worked very hard to win them,"" she said. While the marbles are old, she said, they are in good condition.

"A New Zealand police charge of ""attempting to procure murder"" against AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd has been dropped, his lawyer said. Rudd, the 60-year-old drummer for the legendary hard rock band, had been accused of trying to have two men killed. But the Crown Solicitor decided there wasn't enough evidence to justify it, attorney Paul Mabey said in a statement. ""The charge alleging an attempt to procure murder should never have been laid. The Crown Solicitor's opinion was not sought. The charge is now withdrawn, within 24 hours of Mr. Rudd's first appearance in court,"" Mabey said. ""Mr. Rudd has suffered unnecessary and extremely damaging publicity as a result of widespread and sensational reporting of a very serious allegation, which on any basis was never justified."" Rudd still faces other charges, including threatening to kill, Mabey said. ""Mr. Rudd will defend the charge of threatening to kill. Charges relating to personal possession of drugs are minor,"" he said. Police searched Rudd's waterfront home in Tauranga on Thursday morning, TVNZ reported. The Australian-born drummer moved to New Zealand in 1983, after being sacked by the group. He rejoined the band years later. AC/DC is one of the world's biggest-selling musical acts, and in 2003 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's latest album, ""Rock or Bust,"" is scheduled for release December 2. In a statement Thursday, the band said Rudd's absence wouldn't affect the album's release or a tour scheduled for next year. ""We've only become aware of Phil's arrest as the news was breaking,"" the statement said. ""We have no further comment.""

"It's happened to most of us.  We suddenly wake up and find ourselves disoriented, wondering where we are, and possibly mistaking a light in the distance for something completely different. Usually it's no big deal -- you shake it off, wake up and move on. If you happen to be pilot on a trans-Atlantic flight, the consequences can be much more serious -- like mistaking the planet Venus for another plane and sending the plane you're piloting into a dive that slammed passengers into the ceiling and back to the floor. A report released Monday by Canada's Transportation Safety Board describes what happened on January 14, 2011. The first officer on Air Canada flight 878 from Toronto to Zurich, Switzerland, was tired and needed a nap. The ""controlled rest"" is legal and an accepted procedure in order to improve on-the-job performance and alertness. With the captain's permission, the first officer drifted off for a few Zs. While the nap is supposed to last no more than 40 minutes, the first officer slept for 75 minutes and woke up feeling unwell, the report states. By that time, the captain had turned on the seat belt sign for some expected turbulence. There was also a U.S. Air Force C-17 nearing the Air Canada 767. The first officer saw a bright object ahead of the plane -- the planet Venus -- and mistook it for the approaching C-17.  The captain corrected him and said the C-17 was straight ahead and 1,000 feet below. At that point, the captain of the Air Canada jet and the C-17 pilots flashed their planes' landing lights at each other to acknowledge their position. But the first officer, still believing that the object in the sky above him was the cargo plane, initiated a dive to avoid the perceived imminent collision -- sending the jetliner toward the Air Force plane. The captain saw what was happening and immediately pulled back on the control column in a frantic attempt to increase altitude.  As quickly as that, the C-17 passed underneath the Air Canada jumbo jet with 103 people on board. Within seconds, the plane had gone from its assigned altitude of 35,000 feet down to 34,600 feet and back up to 35,400 feet before finally recovering back to its 35,000 feet cruising altitude. It sent passengers who were not wearing their seat belts flying. ""I was sleeping and I was literally and violently thrown out of my seat and was slammed into the ceiling,"" passenger Louisa Pickering told the CBC.  ""I hit the top of the ceiling and fell back to the ground."" Many of the passengers thought the plane had hit something. ""It didn't feel like turbulence,"" she said.  ""It was very sudden -- it felt like it was one violent bump."" The sudden drop was a shock for unsuspecting passengers. ""Some people were working on their laptops and had their seatbelts on,"" passenger Ashlyn O'Mara said in a CBC interview.  ""Their laptops went flying, completely gone, glasses went missing."" ""People were screaming,"" she added. Fourteen passengers and two flight attendants were injured. ""I do remember them asking for a doctor -- if there was a doctor,"" Pickering said.  ""There was a pregnant woman on the flight and she had some injuries."" The flight continued to Zurich, where the injured passengers and crew were treated. The report says the incident points out a couple of inherent risks. First, ""North American-based pilots flying eastbound at night towards Europe are at increased risk of fatigue-related performance"" issues. It also gives credence to the warning you often hear -- but might ignore -- that passengers should wear their safety belts at all times when seated.","The report says the first officer became disoriented after a nap .

"Some of the biggest names in publishing and many of the most eagerly anticipated titles of the year are hitting bookstore shelves just in time for the holiday shopping season. So if you're searching for a gift for a loved one or just looking for a good book to curl up with on the couch, here are four novels out this week for anyone looking for a page load of thrills. Michael Connelly, ""The Black Box""Michael Connelly has been a favorite among crime fiction fans for two decades. His books have sold 45 million copies worldwide, and he's won every award given to mystery writers. This year, he celebrates a major milestone: the publication of his 25th novel in 20 years. ""The Black Box"" features Connelly's best known character, LAPD Detective Harry Bosch, back on the case. This time out, Bosch is tracking down a killer in a 20-year-old unsolved murder. The victim is a young female photojournalist shot during the infamous 1992 Los Angeles riots. At first, Bosch has little to go on beyond a shell casing from the missing murder weapon. But the determined detective continues to dig, searching for the so-called black box of the title, the one piece of evidence that brings the crime into focus and pulls the case together. Connelly's plot is packed with procedural detail but moves quickly, taking several unexpected turns along the way. And while he's grown older, Bosch hasn't slowed down; he continues to grow more interesting and reveal new levels of depth behind his badge. With the case coming to a climax, Bosch is forced to battle the bureaucracy of the LAPD as well as the bad guys, but readers won't be disappointed as Connelly proves again that neither he nor Bosch has lost his touch. Read an excerpt from ""The Black Box"" Eliot Pattison, ""Mandarin Gate""At first glance, Inspector Shan Tao Yun of Eliot Pattison's latest, ""Mandarin Gate,"" couldn't be more different from Harry Bosch. He's a former police inspector from Beijing who lost his job, his family and his freedom after pursuing a case that implicated high-ranking members of China's communist regime. As punishment, Shan was sentenced to years of hard labor in a Tibetan work camp. Now, in Pattison's seventh novel featuring Shan, the former inspector has been unofficially released but is still unable to return to his former home. A man without a country and no official identity, he's forced to take shelter with a group of outlawed Buddhist monks in the remote mountains. Working a menial job as a ditch inspector, he stumbles across a gruesome crime scene: Three people, including a Tibetan nun, have been murdered at an old Buddhist temple. Like Harry Bosch, Shan is a man of passion and principle; the murders reignite old instincts, and Shan begins a dangerous search for the truth. His investigation quickly uncovers what could be a coverup by Chinese authorities, and Shan knows that solving the case could land him right back in prison. The Edgar award-winning Pattison portrays the oppression of the Tibetan people with dramatic delicacy and rich insight. While ""Mandarin Gate"" is set in a locale farther away than most readers will ever dare venture, this mystery brings the plight of Tibet into sharp focus, weaving the region's cultural, social and political conflict into a compelling narrative. Read an excerpt from ""Mandarin Gate"" ""City of Dark Magic"" by Magnus FlyteThe genre-bending ""City of Dark Magic"" is difficult to describe, and that's a good thing. An entertaining mix of magic, mystery and romance, it's one of the most original novels released this year. Musicologist and Beethoven expert Sarah Weston receives an unexpected invitation to travel to Prague, where she spends the summer working for a wealthy family, researching and cataloging the world-famous composer's manuscripts at their private museum. Soon after she arrives, strange things start to happen. Weston discovers that her academic mentor may have been murdered, and she uncovers a mystery that reaches all the way back to the 16th century. To reveal much more would spoil the fun, but author Magnus Flyte, a pseudonym for authors Meg Howrey and Christina Lynch, has taken the ""kitchen sink"" approach to the plot. The authors packed their debut novel with page after page of unexpected twists. There's an ex-CIA agent, a handsome prince, a Cold War-era plot, time travel, hell portals and a 400-year-old dwarf with an attitude. Prague, with its rich, mysterious history, is the perfect backdrop for the story. Fans of classical music will appreciate the trivia-like detail on Beethoven and the search for his ""Immortal Beloved."" This all may sound a bit scattered, but Weston is an appealing heroine, and the over-the-top story doesn't take itself too seriously. Howrey and Lynch say they wrote the book via e-mail, alternating chapters, and it certainly reads like they had a good time putting it together, even leaving the door open for a sequel. Read an excerpt from ""City of Dark Magic"" ""Cold Days"" by Jim ButcherThere's much more magic in Jim Butcher's newest, ""Cold Days."" This is his 14th novel featuring the immensely popular Harry Dresden, Chicago's only professional wizard and private investigator. Equal parts Sam Spade and Gandalf the Grey, Harry is dead at the beginning of the book -- mostly, anyway. Wait, what? Fans needn't worry. Although Harry was murdered in the last installment of the best-selling series, he is brought back to life by a powerful being called Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness. Now, Harry is no longer a mere mortal; he has become the Winter Knight, with a slew of newfound powers. The catch? Harry is indebted to Mab, eternally. Her word is his command, literally, and what she has planned for him makes death look like a holiday. While the story could be classified as pure fantasy, written from Harry's wisecracking point of view, the book is thrilling fun and, like ""City of Dark Magic,"" not too self-important. For readers searching for something different, ""Cold Days"" will cast a spell over many who might not typically opt for a fantasy title.

"Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that he found it ""frustrating"" that the Justice Department hasn't been able to carry out criminal prosecutions of executives whose risky banking practices blamed for the global financial crisis. As Holder wraps up nearly six years at the helm of the Justice Department, the attorney general has drawn criticism for his department's record on white collar crime. Holder frustrated no person went on trial for financial crisis . Some critics say the department failed by not bringing charges as a deterrent against shoddy practices on Wall Street. Some fault him for instead extracting billion dollar settlements from the world's biggest banks. Holder has defended the department's record saying the settlements are one way to prod shareholder to hold management more accountable. Still, in an exclusive interview with CNN on Monday, Holder acknowledged that the lack of criminal prosecutions of executives ""is something that is frustrating."" ""The American people should understand we looked at those matters, tried to come up with ways in which we could hold people and institutions accountable,"" Holder told CNN. ""We have prosecuted certain institutions.  We have gotten record amounts of money in and we've used that money for appropriate remedial measures so that people can stay in their houses, have their mortgages reduced. So a lot of good has come from our efforts in that regard."" Holder noted that he has called for Congress to change federal law to encourage white collar whistleblowers from inside Wall Street to help the Justice Department bring cases. Holder 'cautiously optimistic' on legal pot . There are, he said, ""a number of measures that I think Congress might change so that the prosecution of these kinds of cases is not as difficult as they are."" Here are other things we learned from the interview: . 1. There are ""about a dozen"" American jihadists in Syria and Iraq. That, at least, is ""our estimate now,"" Holder said. He said the government has ""dozens of investigations that are underway about other people who have either gone or are planning to go."" ""So this is something that is a priority for us on -- at the Justice Department and at the FBI, working in conjunction with our U.S. attorneys, where we're trying to engage in preventive activities as well,"" he said. 2. He won't write a book critical of Obama while the president's in office. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta criticized Obama's decision-making ability, especially in entanglements such as Syria, in a recently-published book. Holder said Panetta's comments were ""unfortunate"" -- and that he should have waited. ""Frankly, I don't think it's something that a former cabinet member should do while the president he served is still in office,"" Holder said. ""That's not something that I would even consider doing."" 3. He's disappointed that gun control measures haven't become law. Holder said he takes it ""personally as a failure"" that Congress didn't react to shootings like the one in Newtown, Connecticut, by changing U.S. gun laws. ""The inability to pass reasonable gun safety laws after the Newtown massacre is something that weighs heavily on my mind,"" Holder said. 4. But he counts gay rights and voting rights efforts as important successes. He listed knocking down the ""final vestiges of discrimination"" on those issues among the first of ""a whole variety of things that I'm really proud of the people of this Justice Department and the way they've done them over the past six years."" Also on that list: Criminal justice reforms; record settlements with financial institutions; and ""the work we've done in the national security sphere."" 5. Holder is watching Missouri before making a decision on charges in the Michael Brown shooting. He said if Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Brown in Ferguson, isn't indicted, he'd first want to see whether Missouri's efforts were ""adequate."" ""I think what we'll have to do, as we always do in a civil rights investigation from a federal perspective, is look at what the state has done and then make a determination as to whether or not the state investigation was adequate,"" Holder said.","Holder sat down for an interview with CNN Monday .

"The grim search for missing hikers and bodies buried under snow continued Saturday against the dramatic backdrop of Nepal's Himalayas, as officials confirmed that at least 39 people had died in an exceptionally heavy snowfall. Rescue crews combed the high-altitude paths and passes of the popular Annapurna region, as well as the neighboring Manang district for trekkers missing for nearly a week. Nine stranded Israeli tourists were rescued Thursday, as well as three Canadians and four Indians who were pulled to safety, according to the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal. The group said it deployed helicopters to rescue hikers stranded by snow, floodwaters and avalanches unleashed along the popular Himalayan trekking trails by heavy snow Tuesday. Regional administrator Dinesh Kumar Thapaliya told CNN that 14 trekkers were now known to have died near the iconic 5,416-meter (17,770-foot) Thorung La Pass in Mustang district, the highest point of the popular 21-day Annapurna Circuit trek. The bodies include those of Israelis, Nepalis and Poles, he said. Even as the total death toll climbed from the 17 reported Wednesday, Thapaliya warned that there are chances of finding more people dead or lost around the pass. A Nepal army team made it up to 16,000 feet on Thursday -- still short of the pass -- on the side of the mountain where the 14 bodies were found. 'This is the dangerous part' Friday's search efforts were concentrated on the other side of the pass, which falls in Manang district, ""This is the dangerous part,"" Thapaliya said. There has been no contact with the remote area even by phone, he said. One Israeli was rescued from near the pass Thursday. Three trekkers have been confirmed as missing, two of them Indian and one Japanese. The pass is not the only area to see deaths due to the unseasonably heavy snow. The bodies of another five trekkers, four Canadians and an Indian, were found in Manang district, Thapaliya said. Three Nepali farmers also were killed. Farther west, five mountaineers -- two Slovaks and three Nepalis -- lost their lives in an avalanche Tuesday night near Nepal's seventh highest peak, Mount Dhaulagiri, officials said. Altogether, 326 people have now been rescued as of Saturday, more than half of them from Manang district, said Baburam Bhandari, chief district officer of  Nepal's Mustang district. 'Trekking is adventurous' This is already one of the deadliest such tragedies in the history of Nepal, a nation of about 26 million known worldwide for its spectacular mountain ranges, including Mount Everest. Annapurna is far and away the most popular of its trekking areas, with some 90,000 trekking there in 2013, according to Narendra Lama, tourism officer of Annapurna Area Conservation Project. ""There have been incidents of trekkers being killed in snowstorms, landslides and avalanches in the past but not as many as this year,"" Lama said. ""But I do not think that this disaster will have a big impact since it is a natural disaster and not about a security situation,"" he said. ""Trekking is adventurous in nature after all."" October is the best month of the year to do the Annapurna Circuit trek, meaning more visitors than usual may have been in the area when unusually heavy snow caused by Cyclone Hudhud in eastern India came down Monday and Tuesday. Last year, about 20,000 foreign trekkers crossed the Thorung La Pass, almost 6,000 of them in October, according to Annapurna Conservation Area statistics. Many remote Nepali communities rely on foreign trekkers and mountaineers for income and employment, meaning a drop in visitors could hit local people hard. Survivor recalls how ice tumbled down in Mount Everest avalanche . The deaths come only six months after tragedy last struck Nepal, on the slopes of Mount Everest. Then, a bruising avalanche of ice swept 16 Sherpas to their deaths. After the accident, which came right before the peak season in May, many Sherpas refused to climb and at least six companies that lead Everest expeditions called off their 2014 climbs.","39 bodies have now been found, regional administrator says .

"Jury selection in the trial of James Holmes, the suspect in the 2012 Colorado movie theater shooting, won't begin until January, a judge ruled Monday. The delay gives Holmes' defense team more time to review a court-ordered sanity examination and prepare for the trial. His attorneys had asked for a longer delay in the trial, Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. said in his order. But the judge said he ""refuses to unnecessarily delay this case."" Jury selection will begin January 20, and attorneys should be prepared to make opening statements on June 3, Samour said. It could take up to four months to pick a jury in the death penalty trial, he said. Holmes is accused of opening fire inside a packed movie theater in Aurora during a midnight showing of the Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in July 2012, killing 12 people. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the 166 charges he faces in the rampage. The trial has been delayed several times. It was originally set to begin in August 2013. Holmes' attorneys argued in a motion filed last year that their client ""suffers from severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life."" Last month, the parents of a woman killed in the shooting filed a lawsuit accusing online retailers who allegedly sold Holmes ammunition, body armor, tear gas and other equipment of negligence.","A judge rules that jury selection will begin on January 20 .

"(CNN)But we have to pick ONE pet . And pick it out soon. You know mother told us . To get back by noon! If that cadence sounds familiar, but you can't place the words, don't be alarmed. That phrase is from a new -- that's right, new -- Dr. Seuss book scheduled to be released in July. More than 20 years after his death in 1991, a box filled with text and sketches will come to life in the latest creation by Theodor Seuss Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss: ""What Pet Should I Get?"" The story ""captures the excitement of a classic childhood moment -- choosing a pet,"" publisher Random House Children's Books said in a release. Geisel's widow, Audrey Geisel, found the manuscripts and illustrations in their La Jolla, California, home soon after her husband died. She set the materials aside, only to rediscover them in 2013 while cleaning out his office. ""While undeniably special, it is not surprising to me that we found this because Ted always worked on multiple projects and started new things all the time,"" Audrey Geisel said in the release. The publisher said it expects to release two additional books from the materials that were found. Cathy Goldsmith, Dr. Seuss' former art director, said she believes Geisel wrote ""What Pet Should I Get?"" between 1958 and 1962. ""The brother and sister in the book are the same as those in his bestselling Beginner Book 'One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish,' which was published in 1960,"" Goldsmith said. According to the release, Goldsmith is the last Random House publishing executive to have worked directly with Geisel while he was alive. ""My connection to Ted remains as vital as it was when we worked closely together years ago -- I know he is looking down, watching over the process, and I feel a tremendous responsibility to do everything just as he would have done himself,"" she said. Audrey Geisel said the timing of the new release is extra special for her. ""It is especially heartwarming for me as this year also marks twenty-five years since the publication of the last book of Ted's career, Oh, the Places You'll Go!"" she said.","A new Dr. Seuss book will be released on July 28 .

"(CNN)A sweet treat has turned potentially deadly for dozens of people in multiple states. At least seven people have died after eating caramel apples that may have been infected with Listeria monocytogenes. Some 32 people have become infected with the deadly bacterium in 11 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those people who got sick 31 were hospitalized and seven deaths have been reported. A press release from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that ""listeriosis contributed to at least three of these deaths."" The Public Health Agency of Canada has also identified two cases of listeriosis in Canada and the samples show the same DNA fingerprints as the American cases. Listeria What you need to know . Of the people who have gotten sick, 10 were pregnant. Pregnant women are 10 times more likely to get listeriosis after eating infected food. Of the rest of the cases, three were children who were otherwise healthy, the CDC said. Symptoms of listeriosis infection include muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, fever and convulsions. Typically, symptoms begin three to 70 days after eating the tainted food. To date 23 of the 26 people who were interviewed about their illnesses remembered eating commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples before they got sick. Most of the people who got sick with this outbreak saw the doctor in late October and November. Investigators are still trying to determine all the contributing factors in the case.  To date caramel apple brands named in interviews include Happy Apple, Carnival and Merb's Candies.  Investigators are also looking at other companies for the source of the contamination. In the meantime, the CDC is warning consumers who may have bought caramel apples with toppings like nuts, chocolate or sprinkles not to eat them, at least not until investigators figure out the source of the contamination. Three companies -- Happy Apple Company of Washington, Missouri; California Snack Foods, of El Monte, California; and Merb's Candies of St. Louis, Missouri -- have issued voluntary recalls of their caramel apples. The companies have used apples from Bidart Bros. The FDA traced the distribution of the apples eaten by eight people who got sick in the outbreak.  Bidart Bros. is the only apple grower that supplied both Happy Apple Company and Merb's Candies. On December 22, Bidart Bros. recalled Granny Smith apples it sold in 2014 to caramel apple companies. Lab results for Listeria monocytogenes done in a joint inspection of the firm by the FDA and the California Department of Public Health turned up positive. Lab tests are ongoing. On January 6, Bidart Bros. expanded its voluntary recall to include Gala apples shipped from the company's Shafter, California, packing facility in 2014. There are about 1,600 cases of listeriosis reported in the United States every year.

"(CNN)Unique? Suni was much more than that. He was vital to the survival of his kind. So, on Friday, after rangers found the northern white rhino lifeless in his hut on a Kenyan wildlife conservancy, a short countdown to extinction began. Suni was one of only seven northern whites left in the world, all of which live in captivity. There are none known to be left in the wild. More importantly, Suni was one of only two breeding males left, said the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in a statement. Now the conservationists have but one male and two females that can breed. And that doesn't happen often. When Suni mated with female Najin in April 2012, it was her first time in ten years. A month passed before they mated again. So far, no offspring. Rhinos on a plane: Life-saving mission across borders . But Ol Pejeta conservationists say they will persevere ""in the hope that our efforts will one day result in the successful birth of a northern white rhino calf."" If not, the end is nigh for the northern white rhino, which is a subspecies. There is a related subspecies call the southern white rhino. It, too, was nearly extinct, but conservation efforts have raise its numbers to 20,000, the World Wildlife Fund said. Suni was 34 years old when he died, and Ol Pejeta felt obliged to say that he wasn't poached for his horns. That's what got most of the thousands of his ancestors, which once roamed northern African savannahs, the WWF said. Ol Pejeta called that ""a sorry testament to the greed of the human race.""

"It was late at night when the priest raised the alarm. Heavy rain was falling on Gobindghat, a town in the foothills of the Himalayas where Sikh pilgrims stop on their way to a holy site farther into the mountains. A monsoon deluge had swept in earlier and heavier than usual in this part of northern India, bringing a risk of floods. But before residents and pilgrims in the town could heed the priest's warning, water had engulfed the town. ""Some people climbed upwards, some ran here and there,"" said Gurjit Singh, who had traveled to Gobindghat with his 12-year-old son. ""It was chaos."" Barrages of water, mud and rocks have hit scores of towns and villages in the Indian state of Uttarakhand in the past week, inundating homes, shrines, roads and vehicles. Uttarakhand's chief minister, Vijay Bahuguna, has described the disaster as a ""Himalayan tsunami."" Dotted with temples and often referred to as ""the Land of Gods,"" Uttarakhand attracts large numbers of pilgrims from around India to its mountainous reaches. Those travelers, many of them far from home and short on belongings, are now caught up in the destruction. Thousands of rescue workers are trying to reach more than 50,000 people cut off by the waters. Bahuguna told CNN's sister network CNN-IBN on Friday night that the death toll was 556 but  could rise. The bodies ""were either buried or floating in slush,"" he said. It will take 15 days to complete evacuations in the province, he added. Other parts of northern India, including New Delhi, have also been hit by flooding, but Uttarakhand has suffered the worst of the devastation. The rains over the region have eased in the past few days, aiding in the rescue of about 30,000 people, Bahuguna said. 'A second life' ""There was nothing but death in front of us,"" Singh said Thursday after getting out of a crowded car ferrying people to dry, flat land. ""Now that we've got out, we feel like we've got a second life."" His son, Rana Udesh Pratap, said the trek to safety was long. ""I held my father's hand and walked and walked and walked on a narrow path,"" he said. The two had made a pilgrimage to Uttarakhand  from the nearby state of Punjab to visit the Sikh Hemkunt Sahib shrine. Others were still struggling with what they had endured. A man named Kailash told CNN-IBN that he, his wife and 4-year-old son didn't know how they were going to get back to their home in Jodhpur, hundreds of kilometers to the southwest. ""We don't have a penny, how will we reach home?"" he asked, explaining that his family had gone hungry for three days before they were evacuated to a hospital in the town of Rudrapyrayag. They had been in Kedarnath, a centuries-old Hindu holy town at the heart of the destruction. Pictures show the town's temple surrounded by mud and rocks. Kailash recalled what he and his family endured before they were flown out. ""We had to walk over dead bodies,"" he said. ""Nothing is left there, everything is finished. We can't even find our relatives."" A search for the missing . Others were searching for relatives amid the chaos. A Facebook page for rescue and relief in Uttarakhand was peppered with pleas for help in finding people. ""It is with great hope that I am writing to you to alleviate the distress of my family,"" wrote Shantalu Srivastava in a post seeking information about his brother, sister-in-law and two nieces. Srivastava said that the family had traveled to Kedarnath from Lucknow, in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh, and that he had last heard from them Sunday. The national government has dispatched the army to help with rescue efforts and promised 10 billion rupees ($170 million) in disaster relief funds to the Uttarakhand government. Some observers are saying the disaster was man-made. Devinder Sharma, an environmentalist, blamed industrial activity in India's Himalayan region.

"CNN is doing something terrifying and awesome this week: The network is asking you to be my boss. You have the power to vote on the stories I'll do over the next year as part of a new social-justice project called Change the List. Polls close at 2 p.m. ET Monday. You can find the ballot, with 20 topics to choose from, at CNN.com/Change. I'll do the top five. I say it's terrifying because you have me in a state of near-constant panic as I wait to hear which stories I'll be doing (at one point on Friday morning, the fifth and sixth place stories were tied) and awesome because this is a great experiment in journalism as democracy, in letting the voices of the people be heard. The response has been mostly wonderful. As of Friday morning, 28,000 ballots had been submitted. Melinda Gates, Rotary International and Change.org all tweeted about it. The New York Observer praised the aspirations of the project and said it represents a ""very different kind of journalism than the 'infotainment' that the CNN's brand, fairly or not, is known for."" (I'll take that as a compliment, although you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who would label Arwa Damon's work in Syria, Erin Burnett's reports from Iran or Christiane Amanpour's anything ""infotainment."") And many of you wrote to me personally to say that you appreciated the fact that CNN was listening to your points of view. ""I just wanted to drop a line and say thank you for actually listening and trying."" ""Thank you for your invitation to participate."" ""Thanks for even asking."" ""To say you have made my day hugely understates the case."" The feedback isn't all sunshine and unicorns, of course. Some of you have tweeted me that this is ""not journalism"" because the story-selection is crowdsourced. Others called it a gimmick or a marketing ploy. And, on the other end of the who-controls-the-news spectrum, some of you said that it was draconian and old-school of me to present 20 ideas to choose from -- rather than asking you for the story ideas in the first place. Many of you have e-mailed me with smart, specific story concepts that you hope will be considered for a sixth Change the List story, which will be chosen by a small group of CNN editors. Perhaps the whole thing could have been crowdsourced. It's too late for that. But I did want to air the smart suggestions you shared with me. I collected them on a public Google Doc and have listed them below. Among the most popular write-in ideas: overpopulation, climate change and child abuse in the United States. The first two surprised me. If you look at polls, Americans don't seem to care much for environment and resource issues. In a February survey from the Pew Research Center, only 34% of Americans said climate change was ""something that is essential for the White House and Congress to tackle this year."" This informal feedback suggests that many of you are passionate about these issues. ""You missed some huge ones that mainstream media is neglecting,"" one person wrote in an e-mail. ""Climate change is continuing without much attention. Resource depletion: peak oil (end of cheap oil), aquifer depletion, fishery depletion, etc."" And another: ""At the core of resource, environmental, gender and health issues is human population, a subject most cannot manage to accept."" I could go on, but instead I'll hand over the floor to you. Here are 97 topics you suggested I cover as part of Change the List. They're in no particular order, other than which e-mails and tweets I read first. Have more ideas? Tweet me: @jdsutter. Or e-mail ctl@cnn.com. The wild-card sixth story could come from this list but ultimately will be chosen by CNN's editors. Although I could never cover all these topics alone, I thought it would be helpful to make them public. Maybe someone else will take up the torch. The United Nations has a similar project, for instance, that aims to crowdsource the ""world we want."" Meanwhile, there's still plenty of time to vote for the five stories I will cover as part of Change the List. Winners will be announced Tuesday. Thanks so much for participating.

"Ambergris Caye, in Belize, has held on to the title of world's No. 1 island for the second year running in awards by the travel review site TripAdvisor. The island is acclaimed not only for its beaches but for its coral reef -- the second largest in the world -- limestone caves, and tracts of tropical rainforest dotted with waterfalls. Islands in Polynesia (Bora Bora), Greece (Naxos) and Thailand (Ko Tao), as well as Marco Island, off Florida, were other winners in the top 10 global list. Perhaps less obvious postcard-rack material, the Scottish island of Harris and Lewis ranked no. 5 worldwide and top among European islands. Alastair Lockett, from the Hebridean island's tourist board, was not at all surprised by the accolade. With its ""pure white sand"" and ""turquoise water,"" Harris and Lewis -- which ranked nowhere in last year's top 10 -- actually ""looks Caribbean,"" he told CNN. Its ""accessible remoteness"" and ""sense of space"" were what drew people to the island, he said. Best U.S. islands .

"More than 50 million people worldwide currently are refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced within their own countries, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday, in a new report released to mark World Refugee Day. That figure is more than the entire population of Spain, South Africa or South Korea, or more than double the population of Australia. The 51.2 million registered for 2013 is also 6 million more than the 45.2 million reported in 2012, according to the UNHCR's annual Global Trends report -- a big jump in the wrong direction. The huge increase was driven mainly by the war in Syria, which at the end of last year had created 2.5 million refugees and displaced another 6.5 million people within Syria, the report said. Major internal displacement was also seen last year in Africa, in the Central African Republic and South Sudan, where conflicts have taken on an increasingly ethnic nature. ""We are seeing here the immense costs of not ending wars, of failing to resolve or prevent conflict,"" said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres. While humanitarian organizations can provide some relief, he said, ""political solutions are vitally needed. Without this, the alarming levels of conflict and the mass suffering that is reflected in these figures will continue."" The latest conflict in Iraq, where Sunni extremist fighters are advancing southward toward Baghdad, doesn't figure in the report since it covers 2013. But more than 1 million people have been displaced by fighting in Iraq so far this year -- half of them in the past couple of weeks. That's about one in 30 people nationwide who have fled their homes. The soaring number of refugees means more demand on the world's wealthier donor countries to provide aid and on those nations on the front lines to shelter and absorb the refugees. Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq have all taken in large numbers of refugees from Syria since its 3-year-old civil war began. Speaking in Geneva, Switzerland, on Friday, Guterres warned that if the current conflict in Iraq worsens, prompting citizens to flee the country, the region will come under even greater strain. ""Looking at the region, one asks ourselves, how can refugees from Iraq be received in the context of all the other situations that exist around Iraq?"" he said. ""So, I hope that this outflow will never come because the capacity of the region to deal with it is practically nonexistent."" According to the report, the total number of refugees registered with the UNHCR and its sister organization, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine, in 2013 totaled 16.7 million. The largest populations were from Afghanistan, Syria and Somalia -- together accounting for more than half of the global refugee total, the UNHCR said. By region, Asia and the Pacific had the largest refugee population overall at 3.5 million people, the report said.  Sub-Saharan Africa had 2.9 million, while the Middle East and North Africa had 2.6 million. Another 1.1 million people submitted applications for asylum last year, according to the report, the majority of them in developed countries, with Germany a favorite. Asylum seekers from Syria lodged the most applications, some 64,000, followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo and Myanmar. More than 25,000 asylum applications were filed by children who were on their own or separated from their parents, in what the UNHCR said was a record number. There were relatively few refugee returns in 2013, the report said, totaling fewer than 415,000. Opinion: Deterring and denying asylum seekers in Australia .

"On the ninth floor of Kunming's No. 1 People's Hospital, overflowing patient beds crammed the narrow corridor Sunday afternoon as anxious family members sat by their loved ones. Like many others around him, Dong Wenxian sported a bandage around his head and appeared motionless in bed. ""He's sleeping -- though his condition isn't stable yet,"" his daughter Dong Huixian told CNN. ""There's still metal in his skull -- but he's already the lucky one."" The elder Dong is one of more than 140 people injured in a deadly attack Saturday night when ten knife-wielding assailants stormed the Kunming Railway Station in southwestern China, seemingly hacking at anyone in sight and killing at least 29 people. The U.S. State Department has condemned the attack, calling it a ""horrific, senseless act of violence"" in a statement. Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to ""severely punish the terrorists in accordance with the law."" Authorities said police shot four perpetrators dead on the scene and captured a wounded female suspect. They have also linked the rampage to separatists from the country's far western Xinjiang region, where tensions between Han Chinese and the largely Muslim Uyghurs have sometimes turned violent. READ MORE: Understanding China's restive far west . Dong, a 50-year-old street vendor from the countryside, was trying to buy a train ticket home to visit his sick mother when he was hacked. ""His whole face was covered in blood,"" his wife described the sight greeting the family at the hospital, which has received most of the people injured in the attack. ""We're now waiting for him to go through surgery,"" said Huixian, the 17-year-old daughter. ""But those with even more severe injuries need to be operated on first."" ""Those Xinjiang people are just horrible and I hate their guts,"" she added. A spate of violent incidents has rocked restive Xinjiang in recent months. Only two weeks ago, police announced the death of 11 terrorists in a foiled attack in Aksu Prefecture. Last October, a jeep carrying a Uyghur family plowed into crowds in front of Tiananmen Gate in central Beijing, killing two tourists and injuring 40. Authorities have responded by intensifying their crackdown on suspected Islamic separatists, including the arrest last month of prominent Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti. The killings in Kunming -- a city of more than six million residents, known for its mild weather and leisurely pace -- shocked the nation and occurred at a particularly sensitive time as Chinese lawmakers are set to start their annual session Wednesday to hear the first government work report under President Xi's leadership. Far away from Beijing but a short drive from Dong's hospital is a small, nameless street in front of the massive Kunming Railway Station. Lined with supermarkets, restaurants and a post office, it was again bustling with passengers hauling luggage Sunday afternoon, the blood stains in the area already washed away. Uniformed police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops patrolling the station's sprawling ground regularly passed the street on foot and in cars. Food sellers on the sidewalk exchanged details they had seen or heard about the carnage. READ MORE: China's train station killings described as a terrorist attack . Chang Changwei's mobile phone shop was open but his mind kept wandering back to the night before when screaming crowds from the station suddenly ran toward his street. ""So many people were trying to find a place to hide,"" the 27-year-old shop owner recalled to CNN. ""The restaurant next to me and I let everyone in."" ""I asked my wife and mother to bring my son inside,"" he continued. ""Then I grabbed some metal pipes for myself and a few others, and said, we have to stick together to take them down."" The attackers never came this way, but his mother's recollection of the scene was more harrowing. ""I saw four people die nearby,"" said 58-year-old Hu Xuerong. ""One person was lying face down in the blood with a knife still stuck in his back."" GALLERY: Kunming terror attack, in photographs . The most heartbreaking moment for Hu came later, however. Her 3-year-old grandson, after witnessing the horror, told her he was too scared to sleep. Across Chinese cyberspace, stories of the perpetrators not sparing children or the elderly during their killing spree have spread quickly and stirred the strongest emotions. In social media, some users' attempts to reflect on the root causes -- including waves of Han migration into Xinjiang and the treatment of Uyghurs in their native land -- to the latest terror were quickly drowned out by the overwhelming sound of fury. Chang, the shop owner, admitted he'd never given much thought to Xinjiang separatists. After the attack Saturday night, however, he's not sure what can be done to stop them for one simple reason. ""When they started hacking at people, they were already prepared to die,"" he said. ""They are not afraid to die.""","Families of victims are struggling to make sense of the terror attack in Kunming .

"Curbing China's appetite for wild game is just the beginning of the war against illegal poaching, say conservationists. Last week, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) clarified the country's laws on the illegal wildlife trade. Anyone who eats endangered species, or buys them for other purposes, is punishable by up to 10 years in jail, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Cheryl Lo, a spokesperson for the World Wide Fund for Nature who is based in Hong Kong, told CNN she is ""very happy"" that the announcement comes with a long list of protected species. ""The law has always been there, but the interpretation has cleared up the ambiguity. Now it is clear that consumers have to bear responsibility. But we still have to watch if they will actually enforce and execute on the legislation,"" she said. China has 420 animals on a list of officially protected endangered species. It includes the giant panda and golden monkey. Many species on the list are illegally traded for their meat, organs or body fluids, considered delicacies and prized for their supposed medicinal properties. Indigenous to China, the endangered pangolin can be found on restaurant menus selling for as much as RMB 2,000 ($324) a dish. The cuora trifasciata, more commonly known as ""golden coin turtle,"" is traditionally used in making a medicinal jelly. Nowadays, both wild and farmed turtles are very expensive and less commonly used in mass-marketed medicinal turtle jellies. The high cost involved in feasting on endangered species means the meals are a status symbol. Now, those hungry for a taste of the wild will have to think twice before taking a bite. Rhino horn more valuable than gold . In a 2013 report, the International Fund for Animal Welfare found that the illegal wildlife trade ranks fourth in the world as the most lucrative criminal activity internationally, behind narcotics, counterfeiting and human trafficking. And prices for animal items continue to rise. Ivory costs up to $1,000 per pound, while rhino horn is more valuable than gold or platinum, according to the report. ""We have lobbied against the selling of shark fin in Hong Kong for a long time with no results,"" said Lo. ""Last year, mainland China announced a ban on sharks fin at official banquets and Hong Kong also banned shark fin, bluefin tuna and black moss (at official functions). ""Then China decided to destroy confiscated ivory and Hong Kong will follow next month. So I do see a trend of stepping up efforts to protect species in the region."" Hong Kong will burn 28 tonnes of seized ivory on May 15, the largest stockpile to ever be destroyed. But Lo points out that consumers and retailers on the black market are only one part of the puzzle. ""We need to see a lot of effort from many different angles in order to protect endangered species and recover the dwindling populations. ""Population decline can be due to threats to their habitat through urban encroachment, conflicts with agricultural producers, climate change, as well as poaching,"" says the activist.","Illegal wildlife trade fourth most lucrative in the world, behind human trafficking .

"Rapper Tone Loc pleaded no contest Monday to domestic violence and other charges, about three and a half months after a fight with the mother of his child, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced. Tone Loc, whose real name is Anthony Smith, entered the plea in open court of single counts of corporal injury to a spouse, cohabitant or child's parent and possession of an assault weapon, the office said in a press release. The weapon -- a Colt AR-15 Sporter -- was found by investigators, but was not used in the domestic assault. There was no negotiated settlement, according to the district attorney. After the rapper addressed the court, Burbank Superior Court Judge Patrick Hegarty sentenced him to one day in county jail, three years of probation, 52 weeks of anger management counseling and 30 days of community service. He was arrested in June, following what Burbank Police Sgt. Tracy Sanchez then described as ""a physical altercation with the mother of his child."" The entertainer then spent less than three hours in custody before posting a $50,000 bond, according to Sanchez. The 45-year-old rapper rose to stardom in 1988 with his hit singles ""Wild Thing"" and ""Funky Cold Medina."" His deep, raspy voice made him famous not just in the music world, but also helped him as he scored acting roles on television and doing voice work. He has been cast in several sitcoms and reality TV shows, according to the Internet Movie Database.","Performer sentenced to one day in jail after entering plea .

"New York is famous for its singular residents: Loudmouthed taxi drivers. Hirsute Brooklyn hipsters. Upper East Side patrons of the arts. Now, the city is welcoming an unlikely new breed of denizen: a newly discovered species of frog. A team of scientists has identified the unique critter, dubbed the Atlantic Coast leopard frog, in the marshes of Staten Island -- beside New York Harbor and not far from the Statue of Liberty. The frog's habitat stretches from Connecticut to North Carolina, but it's the discovery of an exotic animal species in one of the world's most densely populated urban areas that has scientists buzzing. ""It is incredible and exciting that a new species of frog could be hiding in plain sight in New York City,"" said Joanna Burger, a biology professor at Rutgers University and a co-author of a research paper about the frog, published this week in the scientific journal PLOS One. The finding confirms research done more than 75 years ago by Carl Kauffeld, former director of the Staten Island Zoo, who wrote many books about amphibians and was considered an authority on the subject. Kauffeld published a paper in 1937 in which he claimed to have discovered the new frog species, but his research was dismissed for lack of evidence. Kauffeld died in 1974 at age 63. His cause was taken up six years ago by Rutgers doctoral candidate Jeremy Feinberg, lead author of the new paper. Feinberg and other researchers said they were able to employ modern technology to examine the genetics and mating calls of leopard frogs and determine that the amphibians in the wetlands of Staten Island were in fact distinct from two closely related other species inhabiting the northeast U.S. ""We had the benefits of genetic testing and bioacoustic analysis that simply weren't available to Kauffeld to prove that even though this frog might look like the two other leopard frogs in the area, it was actually a third and completely separate species,"" Feinberg said. In giving the scientific name Rana kauffeldi to the new frog, Feinberg and a team of seven other researchers chose to honor Kauffeld and his work. ""After some discussion, we agreed that it just seemed right to name the species after Carl Kauffeld,"" Feinberg said.  ""We wanted to acknowledge his work and give credit where we believe it was due, even though it was nearly 80 years after the fact."" Despite its trademark urban canyons of steel, glass and concrete, New York actually is home to a wide variety of animal life. The 843 acres of Central Park, for example, contain raccoons and opossums, many types of migratory birds and a rare species of centipede. And, of course, lots and lots of pigeons. No word on whether the Staten Island frog ever swims across the harbor to Manhattan for a little sightseeing. But given the public fascination with the Bronx Zoo cobra that briefly escaped its enclosure in 2011, it may be only a matter of time before the new frog gets its own Twitter account.","A new frog species is discovered in New York, of all places .

"Too often, it's tempting to view sports through rose-tinted glasses. We believe that coaches always have the best interests of our young people at heart and that everything they do on the side of that court, field, pool or track is for the long-term, holistic benefit of young people. We even rationalize that coach-player interaction and athlete management behavior that makes us wince and avert our gaze  somehow makes our children -- and even society -- stronger and our future elite athlete role models more humble and worthy. Sadly, ""it's character-building"" is the rallying cry for dysfunction and another damaged generation.  Even when we believe that a young person's sports experience is on the wrong track, we convince ourselves it can't have that much of an impact.  I wish that were true, but medieval coaches, like the recently fired Mike Rice at Rutgers University, are a detriment to society, not just sport. Opinion: Wrong move to fire bullying coach . As a former basketball player at college and in the NBA, I know this coaching style firsthand. Frankly, you can't print the way I was treated in some sporting environments.  At a major U.S. university,  I had an assistant coach who would engineer drills to maximize the chance of fighting or conflict and who frequently called his players ""p**sy"" and ""queer."" In the pros, players were humiliated every day with the crude epithets of sports, demeaned, belittled and challenged physically by coaches without the ability to actually take up their challenge. It was demoralizing, but at least we were well compensated for being treated like dirt. What saved me is that I didn't start playing sports until I was 17, so I was spared much of the trauma of what I see happening to kids today. I'm not soft, and I'm certainly not politically correct.  Indeed, I make sure that membership in my sports and community center in the UK is challenging: physically demanding and psychologically testing but emotionally warm. A place where high value is placed on building and nurturing positive relationships while still expecting the very highest standards in sport, study and life from our participants. Watch: John Amaechi on coaches who bully . I saw the video of Rice's coaching ""techniques"" and felt momentarily vindicated -- before waves of nausea born of watching the repeated verbal, physical, emotional and psychological abuse overwhelmed that momentary hubris. I take a lot of stick, mostly from men and from around the world, who think that Rice's behavior might be a bit extreme but that coaching is somehow not beholden to the usual educational norms. In classrooms and other educational settings, this behavior would never be tolerated and indeed would mean expulsion from an entire profession, not just from a job. We have allowed a parallel universe to develop where sports coaching is concerned.  We don't generally tolerate granting underqualified but well-meaning teachers unfettered access to vulnerable people. But in sports, someone giving up some time for free and winning some games --  while being entirely unqualified to be around young people --  is vaunted. I watch amateur sports most weeks and always ask parents who see coaches screaming and spitting, shouting and grabbing their children whether they would tolerate that as ""character-building"" if it were a French or math teacher doing the same thing.  Invariably, their faces change, and you see the immediate outrage. The truth is, they would never countenance that treatment if it happened in the classroom. Without the shield of sports gear and sweat, the damage to their children becomes clear. I am aware that in the U.S. and Great Britain, coaches are usually volunteers, and volunteers are well-meaning.  But I will say very strongly that I don't care. Being well-meaning and full of good will is not sufficient. Abusive coaches  are the products of emotionally illiterate and physically and psychologically violent, coercive and under-informed coaching environments. Although many family and educational factors can mold a man like Rice, you can be certain his experience in youth sports has played a major role in honing his understanding of acceptable behavior in sports as an adult. Radically improving coaching's  tone and style and respecting an athlete's psychological welfare are so important because bad coaching can unleash monsters on society, each generation meting out abuse learned at the hands of  the one before. Men like Rutgers' Rice are not rare, they are simply rarely caught on tape, rarely exposed and rarely challenged.  A recent UK study (PDF) suggests that 75% of young people experience psychologically harmful treatment in sport. This is the gravity of our collective responsibility and the burden of the role of coach.  As coaches and educators, we participate in the creation of indelible memories for young people. Coaches cannot afford to be just good at winning. The violence and unpredictability of  authoritarian and aggressive coaching  infects all those it touches. Think of the number of young men who have experienced Rice's wrath over his career. That kind of poison infects and potentially manifests in all but the most resilient of them. Coaches need to stop bullying and start mentoring,  educating and inspiring young people. It's for the benefit of our young people now but also for them, and others, when they grow up and gain power of their own.","Rutgers coach Mike Rice fired after video shows him kicking and bullying players .

"Boko Haram fighters late Thursday took over at least three towns in northeast Nigeria, including Chibok, the scene of the April kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls by the militant group, residents and a lawmaker said Friday. ""Boko Haram has taken over Chibok and we have all fled,"" said Enoch Mark, a Christian priest in the town whose daughter and niece are among the kidnapped girls. ""They are now in control of the town, having overpowered the soldiers and the vigilantes."" The militant Islamist group also raided the towns of Hong and Gombi in Adamawa state, 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) from Yola, the state capital. Local hunters and vigilantes had pushed them out of Mubi, which lies near Nigeria's border with Cameroon and is the commercial hub of the state. Boko Haram seized Mubi two weeks ago and renamed the town ""Madinatul Islam"" (""City of Islam"" in Arabic). The militants began administering strict Sharia punishments, including public floggings and amputations. With the invasion of the towns, the militants inched closer to Yola, where thousands of residents from areas seized by Boko Haram are taking refuge. ""Boko Haram are all over the town firing heavy guns as they patrol the streets,"" said Gombi resident Dahiru Sahabi. ""They have burned down the police station, the local government secretariat and the market‎ after overpowering the police."" Residents moved indoors or fled into the bush to escape the insurgents, said resident Rabi Tanimu‎. ""We are all indoors and all we hear is sounds of heavy guns and explosives,"" she said. In Chibok, the town's vigilantes, who help provide security, were quickly overwhelmed by the firepower of the militants. One resident described Chibok as ""a ghost town"" as most residents fled the violence. The insurgents had earlier raided the town of Hong, where they burned down a police station and hoisted their black flag outside the home of a retired military general, said fleeing residents. Before attacking Hong, the ‎militants, riding in vans and on motorcycles, sacked a military checkpoint at nearby Marabar P‎ella village, where they converged after their ouster from Mubi and Maiha, said Hong resident Luka Buba. Chibado Bobi, chief of staff in the Adamawa governor's office‎, confirmed that vigilantes and hunters had recaptured Mubi. ""The state government enlisted the help of the vigilantes and hunters to combat Boko Haram and it is paying off,"" Bobi said.‎ . A resident of Mubi said Boko Haram militants fled the town in droves after the arrival of some 200 vigilantes and hunters, who were armed with homemade guns, spears, clubs, bows and arrows and machetes. The resident, who asked not to be named for personal safety, said hunters captured the ousted occupiers' leader ""outside the military barracks, which the militants (had) converted into their base."" Vigilantes reportedly reclaimed another town, Maiha, from Boko Haram on Wednesday after a fierce battle in which dozens of militants were killed. The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The fate of the schoolgirls abducted from Chibok remains unknown despite an announcement in October that Nigerian officials had reached a ceasefire deal with the group that included the girls' release. But weeks later, the girls are still missing and the group's leader has denied ever making such a deal. Also Friday, a suicide bomber killed six people, including three police officers, and injured five others when he blew up his car at a gas station in northern Nigeria's largest city of Kano, police said. The bomber, who police suspected to be a Boko Haram ‎terrorist, detonated the explosives concealed in his car as he lined up for fuel, Kano State Police Commissioner Adenrele Shinaba told reporters at the scene.","Suicide bomber kills six people in Kano; Boko Haram suspected .

"The Andy Warhol classic painting ""Double Elvis (Ferus Type)"" sold Wednesday at Sotheby's in New York for more than $37 million, the auction house said. With commission, the sale price of $33 million totaled $37,042,500, short of the $50 million that Sotheby's had predicted it might fetch. The piece (silkscreen ink and spray paint on canvas) shows Elvis Presley in a gunslinger pose. First exhibited in 1963 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, the work ""epitomizes the artist's obsessions with fame, stardom, and the public image,"" Sotheby's said in a release. ""Warhol's signature style, coupled with the instantly recognizable faces of his subjects, creates a blurred boundary between artist and sitter."" Warhol made 22 versions of the ""Double Elvis,"" nine of which are held in museums. The painting brings together two iconic figures in American culture, said Catharina Manchanda, curator of modern and contemporary art at the Seattle Art Museum, which has a ""Double Elvis"" on display. ""It's Warhol at his very best. He gives you the celebrity playing a role within cinematic culture and asking us as viewer to confront that head-on,"" Manchanda said. ""It's Elvis with the gun drawn. It's a confrontational moment."" The work is among the most famous of Warhol's paintings of celebrities, which included Elizabeth Taylor, Jacqueline Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. Also Roy Lichtenstein's ""Sleeping Girl"" was sold Wednesday for $44.9 million. That was an auction record for a Lichtenstein piece, Sotheby's said. Observers say the market for contemporary and modern art has been set ablaze in recent months. A version of Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" brought an auction record of $119 million at Sotheby's on May 2, and a Mark Rothko painting ""Orange, Red, Yellow"" sold Tuesday at Christie's for nearly $87 million. Art dealers say the stratospheric rise in art prices is being propelled by wealthy investors from abroad. Wednesday night's winning bid for the Warhol painting came in over the phone; the buyer's name was not divulged. Still, the buy set no records. The top price for a Warhol painting is $71,720,000. As for Warhol, who famously said, ""Making money is art and working is art, and good business is the best art,"" the prices his works are commanding would have been thrilling, Manchanda said. ""He would be amazed and excited to see what's happening,"" she added. Alas, Warhol died in 1987 after undergoing routine gallbladder surgery at what was then known as New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, three blocks south of Sotheby's on New York's Upper East Side. He was 58.","New: Lichtenstein's ""Sleeping Girl"" sells for $44.9 million .

After three seasons on Fox in the mid-'00s -- including one in which it won the Emmy for best comedy series -- ""Arrested's"" fourth season premiered on Netflix on May 26, 2013. Since then, there's also been discussion of an ""Arrested Development"" movie, but nothing has come of it so far. Sarandos said he agreed with criticism that the cast didn't appear together enough during the fourth season, and organizing cast members' schedules is key to the success of a fifth season. He also told USA Today about other plans, including ""Marco Polo,"" a series due later this year; a sitcom starring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, ""Grace and Frankie,"" coming in 2015; and the Wachowskis' show about telepaths, ""Sense8.""

"(CNN) -- Suspected al Qaeda operatives attacked soldiers at a security checkpoint in the eastern Yemeni province of Marib on Thursday, leaving three militants and three soldiers dead, according to the Interior Ministry. Three other soldiers were wounded in the attack, believed to be coordinated by members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the ministry said. Separately, security forces in southern Taiz province captured two militants, including Khalid Saeed Batarfi, a senior al Qaeda leader in Abyan province, according to a statement from the Yemeni Embassy in Washington. Batarfi oversees al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's local media network and is responsible for conducting several terrorist attacks in Abyan and Hadramout, the statement said. Meanwhile, Yemen has been wracked by weeks of unrest, with thousands protesting the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. In addition, the country has struggled with a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. High unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing young population steeped in poverty. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. Saleh has promised not to run for president in the next round of elections.","Possible al Qaeda operatives attack security checkpoint .

"Beijing may have to wait another 16 years before it will have safe, clean air, according to a report from the capital's environmental authority earlier this week. But it's hardly alone in its air pollution woes. The World Health Organization has said that roughly half of the world's urban population is exposed to pollution at least 2.5 times higher than it recommends. Air pollution is now the single largest environmental health risk, with an estimated 7 million deaths globally in 2012 caused by air pollution, according to a report from the health agency in March. Most of the worst polluted cities are in Asia. While it may take years to fix this global problem, innovative minds in the Asia region have come up with creative solutions for living with air pollution. Face mask couture . Can face masks become fashionable? Beijing-based designer and body painter Nina Griffee hopes so. She has created a line of womenswear that incorporates air filters made by Vogmask. The dramatic designs in basic black with fuschia highlights will debut at the Hong Kong Fashion Week for Spring/Summer between July 7 and 10. Some of the looks are reminiscent of burqas, covering the entire head and face, with just the eyes of the wearer exposed -- but it will sure keep the body protected from air particles. DIY purifier . Thomas Talhelm started worrying about the air inside his Beijing home during ""airpocalypse"" in 2013 when Beijing's air quality index skyrocketed to a terrifying 755 -- a 500 reading is considered hazardous for health, meaning people should avoid outdoor activity. The Fulbright scholar couldn't afford the luxury of an expensive air purifier. ""It got me thinking, why are these air purifiers so expensive? How do they work?"" Talhelm said. ""Filters are actually very simple -- an HEPA filter is all you need to get over 99 percent of the PM 2.5,"" he said, referring to particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers that can penetrate deep into lungs, leading to fatal diseases. With three of his friends, Talhelm created Smart Air, an air purifier consisting of a basic household fan with an HEPA filter attached to it. It works as efficiently as the big brands selling for thousands of dollars, removing more than 90 percent of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM 2.5) in your room, according to Talhelm's research. Smart Air has sold over 3,000 basic air purifiers so far and has doubled their staff. Talhelm said the group is currently touring China, holding DIY workshops to show how easy it is to build your own purifier for RMB 200 (about $30). Clean air forecasts . A blue sky may be rare in Beijing, but when it appears, the city becomes a beautiful place to live in. ""I wanted to make sure to get out and do something on those days because if I did that, it would really help me cope with the treachery of the smog,"" said Dustin Grzesik. The former Beijing resident created Banshirne, a free Android app that forecasts the next clean air day based on weather patterns. Grzesik, who is now based in San Francisco, created the app by observing Beijing's weather reports, air quality reports and the US embassy's Air Quality Index Twitter feed. Kaiwen map, a site where people can report environmental conditions in their area, and the Beijing Air Quality Forecast blog are two sites Grzesik finds helpful for analysing China's air quality. On average, a blue sky appeared once a week or once every two weeks in Beijing, according to Grzesik, a geologist by training. Invisible mask . Infipure's ""nose mask"" claims to cut 99% of PM 2.5 without the bulkiness of a surgical face mask. The disposable filters, made from non-toxic, latex-free materials, are inserted into your nostrils and aim to be undetectable. ""In a meeting or conference, it's generally not that great with a full face mask on. Also, in the summer, it gets hot and stuffy,"" said Infipure co-founder Francis Law who saw a market for discreet air filtering masks. ""People care about their health, but don't want all the downsides that come with a traditional face mask,"" he explained. Infipure has been criticized for not disclosing the materials used in their filters, but Law has said that it is a ""trade secret."" Master battery . Stanford professor Cui Yi and his team have developed a high-energy battery that could potentially increase an electric car's mileage by three times without being recharged. The nanotube lithium-ion battery is said to outlast current conventional batteries. After 1,000 charging cycles, the battery still retains over half its energy capacity. Yi's invention can help bolster the appeal of electric cars since cheaper, high-energy batteries are needed to compete against traditional vehicles. Anti-smog kung fu . School children in northern Hebei province are using kung fu to combat air pollution. Students at the Guangming Road Primary School in Shijiazhuang, one of China's smoggiest cities, have been taught 23 moves by deputy dean Wei Huanqiang, who says the practice is effective against air pollution. During heavily polluted days, the exercises, which combine elements of aerobics and acupuncture, could be done indoors when outdoor activity is suspended. The two-minute routine was designed by Wei himself and critics doubt that it has any real impact against the harmful effects of air pollution, although most agree that it is good for kids to exercise. Plant backpack . Taiwanese artist Chiu Chih has designed a survival kit for an apocalyptic world. Dubbed ""Voyage on the Planet,"" a potted plant is housed inside a clear backpack hooked up to two tubes to funnel fresh air into a face mask. It's a bold, abstract take on an oxygen tank. The piece questions the planet's unknown future and environmental depletion. Breathing bike . British artist Matt Hope admits his breathing bike looks ""ridiculous."" ""It was more of an ironic commentary about living in China and people's personal attempts at dealing with it,"" Hope said about his one-off creation that produces clean air while he rides. Hope attached a small generator to the bike's back wheel and as he pedals, electricity is produced to power his homemade filtration system. The air is pulled through a perforated trash bin where dust particles get positively charged and stick to a metal trumpet within the bin. Clean air is then sent through a tube and received in Hope's fighter-pilot mask. ""Earth has a breathable atmosphere, that's why we're here. Being attached to air filtering devices, it defies the point of being alive,"" Hope said, adding that Beijing has a sci-fi feel to it, referring to the copious amount of people who wear face masks outside. Smog vacuum . Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde recently signed an agreement with Beijing officials to jumpstart his smog project -- an electromagnetic field generated by copper coils that will suck pollutants from the sky to the ground like a vacuum, making way for clean air. The project, to be trialed in a Beijing park, has yet to be determined. ""If there's an incentive, things will move fast,"" Roosegaarde said, adding he hopes to start the pilot project next year. A byproduct of this project is the ""smog ring"" -- a piece of jewelry made from smog particulates to be launched later this year. ""The pollution we suck up, the small particles, we don't throw them away. We put them under pressure for a couple of weeks and they crystallize, creating the notion of a diamond,"" Roosegaarde explains. The designer hopes to make 100,000 pieces that will be sold at high-end prices to finance more smog projects. ""By creating a place where you can feel the difference, where you can see the difference, people get an incentive to work together to say, hey, what should we do to make a whole city clean like this?"" Roosegaarde said.","Beijing residents have invented ways to make life bearable under the smog .

"Umm Khattab is an online foodie. She posts pictures of Vietnamese grilled chicken and other recipes on the Web, peppering her conversations, like many young women her age, with emojis and lols. Then there's the photo of the AK-47 next to the Quran that she posted online, calling for British Prime Minister David Cameron's head on a spike. Welcome to the online world of the women of ISIS. Umm Khattab, as she identifies herself online, is one of scores of women that have joined the terror group that has declared an independent Islamic state across huge swathes of Iraq and Syria in recent months. The Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) estimates that as many as 15% of ISIS' foreign recruits are women -- possibly up to 200 women from at least 14 different countries. It's not the first time for women in a jihadist conflict. But it is the first time they have been recruited in such large numbers. ""The classic 'mujahadiyah' is in a supportive role -- as a wife, mother, doing the house tasks for her jihadi male,"" says Veryan Khan of TRAC. ""They have same goals and ambitions as the men once they get there. Now granted, their roles may be much more limited to a 1950's housewife role."" That has been the experience of Aqsa Mahmood, once a shy Glasgow schoolgirl, now married to an ISIS fighter in Syria. She left her family in November 2013 and headed to Syria with nothing more than her university backpack. She is believed to write a blog under the name Umm Layth that reads as a how-to manual for any female ISIS recruit. Top tips: Before you travel, get your shots, pack sturdy boots and a warm coat. But also, pack plenty of hijabs and niqabs -- full body veils -- because they are not readily available in the self-declared caliphate. ""The Syrians (sic) view of Hijab is a complete joke,"" she writes in the blog. ""The abayas are skin tight and their niqaab starts from their forehead and ends at their nostrils."" But her ambitions to take on a frontline role appear to have been thwarted by ISIS' strict rules for women. ""I will be straight up and blunt with you all, there is absolutely nothing for sisters to participate in Qitaal,"" she writes, using the Arabic word for fighting or killing. ""We have plenty brothers (sic) who don't even get selected on operations. The brothers get upset and start crying since they want to participate. So, what does that make you think? For the sisters its completely impossible for the now. InshaaAllah in the future (sic)."" In February, however, ISIS formed Al-Khansaa, a female battalion with about 60 members, all of them believed to between under the age of 25. They now have their own media channel with propaganda videos promoting their work. The battalion has two roles: Manning checkpoints and inspecting all women that pass, and enforcing ISIS' strict morality code for women in the caliphate. There are reports of the women conducting inspections of schools and markets, and flogging women who are not fully veiled in the niqab. ""We are seeing two notable trends that we need to pay attention to: one is women actively participating, or rather being right behind, the front lines. Second, their statements that they want to participate even more,"" says Khan of TRAC. ""This is obviously rapidly changing as we speak. They're being trained in weaponry, how to clean the weapon, how to fire the weapon. And granted these are just basic bootcamp skills, but they have the means to defend themselves."" Despites the seemingly trivial exchange of recipes and designs, there is little doubt that these women are staunch advocates of the values and beliefs of ISIS and regularly call on other ""sisters"" from around the world to make the ""hijrah,"" or journey, to Syria.","Experts say women have flocked to join ISIS, which has seized swathes of Iraq and Syria .

"Finding the most famous chimpanzees in the world is a task that would test the most intrepid of explorers. Reaching the picturesque hinterland of Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania is just the start. A two-hour boat ride across the vast waters of Lake Tanganyika follows. Finally, we disembark and begin to trek through the dense forests of Gombe for a further hour before the chimps in question are finally glimpsed. Peering through branches towards the canopies, we spy a mother and her two young boys feasting on palm nuts. It was close to this spot in 1960 that the Jane Goodall, the British primatologist widely regarded as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, began her near 55-year study of one specially selected chimp family. Goodall, now 80 years old, would sit for hours and observe the complex social structures and interactions of her subjects. The research of that one family and the subsequent generations it has spawned continues to this day, providing ever more fascinating insights into the behavior of the closest living relatives of human beings. The magic of Gombe . ""The magic of Gombe is two factors,"" said Emily Boehm, a PhD candidate at the Jane Goodall Institute Research Center, here to study the chimps. ""It's the opportunity to be here with a well-habituated group of chimpanzees, to come into the forest every day with knowledgeable field assistants. It's (also) the long term data, because Jane Goodall started this study in the early 60s."" ""We have this incredible opportunity to know the chimps here now, and also their mothers and fathers and their grandmothers and all this incredible information that we have on them."" Researchers like Emily come from all over the world to study the chimps at Gombe. There are an estimated 100 chimpanzees there today, broken up into three different communities. The group Goodall studied has the most, with around 60 members. Meat eaters . Even after 50-plus years, researchers are still surprised by what they learn. Before the program began, chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but Goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat. This is a trait we observe as we watch a group of chimps  track Colobus monkeys swinging in the trees above them. We also see another industrious bunch fashion tools to try dislodge termites from beneath a mound. According to senior researcher at the Jane Goodall Foundation, Dr Anthony Collins, activities like these display a high level of intelligence. ""They're so much like humans. There are so many similarities in what they do, the relationships they have to each other, just all kinds of ways, there are subtle communications between them,"" Collins said. He points to the example of how chimps will look to reconcile and embrace one another after a fight or confrontation. ""They have reassurance and forgiveness of things which go wrong,"" he said. Human threat . Despite the behavioral and genetic similarities, however, the chimps proximity to rural human settlements can often be problematic and detrimental to their own well-being. ""In some places that they live, there are lions, leopards, pythons. But on the whole, probably their main enemy is something like me, humans,"" Collins continued. ""(Some) people hunt chimps for eating, some places they get bits of chimps for cures, even witchcraft, and for a while there was a trade in baby chimps for their medical research and things like circuses and zoos."" In the dense forest and woodlands of Gombe, chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior. But that's not always the case in other sectors of the Tanzanian bush where large swathes of land have been transformed for agricultural purposes. This has resulted in a huge number of trees being cut down that would otherwise offer shelter for communities of chimpanzees. Sadly, the best habitats for chimps are often also the best habitat for the likes of nomadic herders. Sustainable farming . Recognizing these problems, the Jane Goodall Institute is working to teach the local population about sustainable farming so the forest is preserved. Through the Gombe-Masito Program, they aim to show villagers that sustainable agricultural techniques can bring both more income and a more vibrant habitat for all species. Preventing deforestation also has the knock on effect of ensuring sediments from the forest continue to run into Lake Tanganyika, maintaining the finely balanced ecosystem beneath the water and the trade of the fisherman in lakeside communities as a result. These deep environmental connections are enough to convince some that chimpanzees are key to the future of rural Tanzania. ""In my opinion, chimps are important for the country's economic growth,"" said Aristides Aloice Kashula, a Gombe-Masito Program forest officer. ""They can be used as a national symbol for tourist attraction into this area of Tanzania, generating income which should later be used for sustainable development of the communities."" ""They are also important in that their habitat, if well conserved, can act as good vegetation covering for the forest."" ""But also again, chimps are a global species, so they have to be kept for generations and generation to come."" That's a sentiment that Jane Goodall herself would be sure to endorse.","Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania home to a very special group of chimpanzees .

"Russia has thrown out the United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. State Department said, claiming that the aid agency has undermined Russia's sovereignty. ""We have recently received a decision of the Russian Government to end USAID activities there,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said this week.  ""The United States is extremely proud of what USAID has accomplished in Russia over the last 20 years, and we will work with our partners and staff to responsibly end or transition those programs."" At APEC Russia and the U.S. look east . Senior Russian officials have said that some of the agency's programs, such as some human rights groups and election monitoring, have undermined Russia's sovereignty, according to the state news agency RIA Novosti. Nuland, speaking at a State Department briefing Wednesday, countered with: . The issue of protecting Russia's sovereignty came up several times during the run-up to Russia's presidential election this year. On election night in Moscow in March, Vladimir Putin punctuated his victory speech with a jab at foreign influence when he said: ""We showed that no one can impose anything on us -- no one, nothing! We showed that our people can distinguish between the desire for renewal and political provocation that has but one goal: to destroy Russia's statehood and usurp power."" In December, he blamed U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for giving a ""signal"" to Russians protesting his rule to turn out for street demonstrations. Pakistan orders foreign aid workers to leave . Nuland, speaking at a State Department briefing Wednesday, argued that U.S. officials ""completely reject the notion that our support for civil society, democracy, human rights, in any way interferes with elections whether in Russia or anywhere else in the world."" ""It is regrettable that the Russian people are not going to be able to benefit from the support that the American people are sending their way in this areas of health (and) environment,"" Nuland added. ""We will continue to work with those Russians in civil society who want to work with us. We do that in many parts of the world where we dont have AID missions, and we are looking now at precisely how we'll work this through, but we are committed to stay on the side of those who want to see a more democratic, more just Russia,"" she said.","The State Department says itis ""extremely proud"" of the work USAID did in Russia .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Despite an epic rift in Turkish-Israeli relations, Turkey's top general announced his troops are relying on new unmanned aerial drones recently purchased from Israel to battle Kurdish rebels. At an international military conference on Monday, the commander of Turkey's armed forces, Gen. Ilker Basbug, said that within the last 10 days, his troops had begun employing Israeli-made ""Heron"" drones on surveillance missions over Turkey's mountainous eastern border with Iraq. Basbug spoke after a weekend of bloody clashes with Kurdish rebels left at least 12 Turkish soldiers stationed in this border region dead. The fact that Turkey still depends on Israel for high-tech defense technology could complicate the Turkish government's threats to punish Israel for a botched Israeli commando raid in which eight Turks and a dual-national Turkish-American were shot dead aboard a Turkish ship carrying aid to Gaza. Israel plans to ease blockade . After the May 31 incident, Turkey's prime minister ominously warned ""nothing would ever be the same again,"" between the two once-close Middle Eastern allies. Recep Tayyip Erdogan has demanded that Israel apologize for what he has repeatedly labeled an act of ""state terrorism"" and ""piracy"" in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey withdrew its ambassador from Tel Aviv, Israel, in protest and cancelled joint military exercises with Israel. But Ankara has been careful not to sever ties with the Israeli defense industry. The long-simmering conflict with rebels from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has flared once again in recent months, making Turkey more dependent on Israeli military technology. ""This is another paradoxical situation ... Turkey has been reluctant to freeze defense industry ties with Israel,"" said Lale Kemal, a journalist who writes a column on military affairs for the Turkish newspaper Zaman. ""You need equipment to fight against asymmetric warfare. These are attack helicopters, surveillance systems such as UAV's [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles], intelligence systems and satellites ... and Turkey doesn't produce any of these systems."" When asked on Monday whether Israeli technicians and engineers had to cut short training on the new drones due to the recent rift in relations, Basbug insisted Turkish operators were adequately prepared to pilot the Herons. ""Now our own personnel, our air force, is using the Heron systems that we bought,"" Basbug said. ""They got the training, it is over. We are capable, we have started using them."" Basbug added that the Israeli-made drones are being sent into Iraqi airspace, in coordination with the U.S. military, to gather intelligence on PKK rebels who have long operated out of remote mountain camps on the Iraqi side of the border. According to the Turkish military, at least 55 of its soldiers have been killed in clashes with PKK fighters since the beginning of March. Over the last week, Turkish warplanes have carried out several air raids against suspected rebel targets in northern Iraq. On March 16, the Turkish military said hundreds of Turkish troops made an incursion several kilometers into Iraqi territory in ""hot pursuit"" of PKK militants.","Turkish troops employing Israel-made aerial drones against Kurdish  rebels .

"Rutgers University fired head basketball coach Mike Rice on Wednesday after ESPN broadcast a video showing him physically and verbally abusing players. The video, which ESPN said features excerpts of practice sessions shot between 2010 and 2012, initially had earned Rice a three-game suspension, a $75,000 fine and a ticket to anger management classes. ""You f**king fairy ... you're a f**king fa**ot,"" Rice appears to say during one session depicted on the video, which also shows him shoving and throwing basketballs at players. Under pressure from incensed state officials to take stronger action, Athletic Director Tim Pernetti said Wednesday that he had made a mistake in favoring suspension. ""I am responsible for the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice,"" Pernetti said in a written statement. ""Dismissal and corrective action were debated in December and I thought it was in the best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong. Moving forward, I will work to regain the trust of the Rutgers community."" Opinion: Rutgers coach and sports' bully culture . Gov. Chris Christie, who a spokesman had said was ""deeply disturbed"" by the video, said Wednesday he supports Rice's firing. ""This was a regrettable episode for the university, but I completely support the decision to remove Coach Rice. It was the right and necessary action to take in light of the conduct displayed on the videotape,"" he said. Rutgers President Robert L. Barchi said he had agreed last year with an outside investigator's recommendation that Rice be suspended, fined and sent to anger management classes. Barchi, who apparently did not review the video at the time, said he concluded Tuesday after viewing it that it showed a ""chronic and pervasive pattern of disturbing behavior."" ""I have now reached the conclusion that Coach Rice cannot continue to serve effectively in a position that demands the highest levels of leadership, responsibility and public accountability,"" Barchi said. ""He cannot continue to coach at Rutgers University."" Rice said Wednesday after he was fired that ""there's no explanation for what's on those videos because there's no excuse for it,"" according to CNN affiliate WABC. ""I can't say anything right now except I'm sorry, and there will never be a time where I'm going to use any of that as an excuse or will there be any excuse,"" he said, according to the station. ""I've let so many people down, my players, my administration, Rutgers University, the fans, my family -- who's sitting in their house, just huddled around because of the fact that their father was an embarrassment to them."" Coach is seen and heard abusing team . 'Total shock' ESPN got the video from former NBA player Eric Murdock, the team's former player development director. He told the network the school fired him for blowing the whistle on Rice. The school says he was let go for ""insubordinate conduct"" unrelated to the video, according to ESPN. In the video, Rice is shown several times throwing basketballs at flinching players, shoving one in the back, kicking at another. He frequently berates players in the clips. ""To see your coach physically putting his hands on players, physically kicking players, firing balls at players from point-blank range, the verbal abuse, the belittling, I was in total shock that this guy wasn't fired, immediately on the spot,"" Murdock told ESPN. But Frank Mitchell, who played at Rutgers under Rice, told CNN what's in the video wasn't the norm at practices. ""From time to time, there's some instances of throwing balls or physically making contact with players, but it only occurred from time to time, it wasn't an everyday type thing,"" he told CNN. ""Obviously, the video shows it happened, but they were isolated incidents. They weren't back to back."" What we can learn from Rutgers' former coach . 'Not acceptable' Efforts by CNN to reach Rice and Pernetti on Wednesday were unsuccessful. But Pernetti previously told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey that Rice's conduct was ""unacceptable and is not to the Rutgers standard."" ""That's why we handed out the significant amount of suspension that we did and all the things that came along with that,"" he said. ""I think it will affect Mike Rice wherever he goes,"" Pernetti told the station Tuesday. ""It certainly affects his tenure. We're trying to do everything we can to support him. But we also had to penalize him within the process too because there are certain words that are said and actions that are taken that are not acceptable no matter who you are and where you work and certainly not Rutgers."" Students interviewed Wednesday were pleased by Rice's firing. The abuse ""should have never happened,"" junior Ariana Blake told CNN. ""That guy should have been gone the first month. It just doesn't look good for Rutgers."" ""I'm surprised he kept his job for what, it's like five months after the video was released,"" junior Vincent Spatola said. On Twitter, the decision to fire Rice also seemed widely regarded as too little, too late. ""I always find it really admirable when someone can do the right thing when everyone is looking,"" Twitter user @adamcox wrote. ""My question is why wasn't he dismissed last year,"" wrote @TheQueez. Similar incident . The video recalled the 2000 sacking of legendary Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight in the aftermath of a videotaped incident in which he put his hand to the throat of a player. While it was another incident that finally led to Knight's firing, it was the videotaped 1997 incident that prompted strict limits on the coach's frequent physical and verbal outbursts and set the stage for Indiana to let him go. It also sparked discussion about how far coaches should go to motivate players, what message such behavior sends to young athletes and how widespread such behavior is in locker rooms and practice facilities. ""Homophobic slurs? The sensitivity of people these days is amazing,"" one commenter wrote on CNN.com. But the majority of commenters appeared to be aligned against the coach. Many called Rice a bully. ""If you did this to your OWN child the state would take them from you!"" another commenter wrote. ""What I think is stark here is how we can be surprised, at this point, by this,"" former NBA player John Amaechi said on CNN's ""Starting Point"" Wednesday. ""You can walk on any sideline almost anywhere in America or Britain, on any given weekend, and see similar behaviors."" Amaechi, a former NBA player who acknowledged he was gay in a 2007 book, called such conduct abusive, and said Rice should be fired. ""There is no context in the universe where that kind of behavior is acceptable. It's physical and verbal abuse. It's psychological and emotional abuse,"" he said. ""He should not be allowed near anybody. I mean forget sports, there is no context where his management style is appropriate."" But, he said, such demeaning language is not uncommon in sports. Nor is a coach like Rice rare, Amaechi said. ""He's just rarely exposed,"" he said. Rice had just ended his third year as the Scarlet Knights' coach with a record of 44-51, and was under contract through the 2014-2015 season. He came to Rutgers from Robert Morris University, where he had a 73-31 record, taking the team to the NCAA basketball tournament twice. Rice's official school bio -- which has since been taken down -- lauded the academic success of his players and credited him for working extensively with cancer and children's charities. The biography also noted ""a relentless style that has become his trademark."" His 2012 salary was $655,470.55, including $300,000 in base pay, according to News 12 New Jersey, which cited public records.","Students say the coach's firing was overdue .

"Esther Mbabazi wheels her bag towards the airstairs of the Boeing 737 sitting quietly on the tarmac at Kigali International Airport. Today she'll be flying from Rwanda's capital city to Juba in South Sudan. A short hop south with a flying time of around 1 hour and 20 minutes. But for Mbabazi, 26, it isn't about the destination. As Rwanda's first female pilot, it's about the journey and her highest priority is to get passengers safely to their terminus. ""Growing up I wanted to be a pilot when I was four,"" says Mbabazi, who became a pilot for Rwanda's national airline carrier, RwandAir, at 24. ""I'd never been inside a cockpit but I used to see a plane in the sky and I imagined that thing must be flown by someone. ""I had to go for it. Even though it looked like a long shot, it was my only shot -- that's how I saw it so I went for it, and here I am."" Dream big . During her childhood, Esther's family would move on a regular basis due to her father's work as a pastor. But her desire to take to the skies never wavered, even after her father passed away in a plane crash in the Democratic Republic of Congo, when the passenger aircraft he was traveling on overshot the runway and hit some terrain. Read this: The woman saving Uganda's lost children . ""From day one, he was always my biggest supporter or fan,"" recalls Mbabazi, who lost her father before turning 10.""[But] an accident is an accident. Like I said, if someone gets hit by a car, you don't stop driving. ""You can't live life being scared an in fear of anything. If something is bound to happen, you can't stop it."" Going all in . Thus, Mbabazi continued to work toward her goal of becoming a pilot and achieving what no other woman in her country had done before. Once she completed high school, she packed her things and bought a one-way ticket to attend pilot school in Uganda. ""When I went it was a one-way decision,"" she says. ""If they bounce me, I'll just pack my things and come back -- so that was the way I joined pilot school, and it was a long journey."" More from African Voices . A year later, Mbabazi began training with Rwandair in Miami and her exploration of the aviation world began. ""My greatest memories are flying to different cities,"" she says. ""Being in the sky gives you a whole other view -- you get to see what they call a bird's eye view of everything."" Sexism in the skies? Now, the young pilot has become a pioneer in a male-dominated industry in Rwanda, and yet she knows she is constantly being closely watched because of her gender. ""No one ever says, 'Oh it's a male crew aircraft that crashed,' even though it's been many of the sort,"" she says. ""But you know, if there's a woman on board and something happens, you know, definitely you're going to be mentioned."" Mbabazi recalls a previous incident where a passenger realized that the pilot for his flight was a woman shortly after arriving at the gate and refused to get on the flight. ""The cabin crew said we'll gladly leave you behind. You've already paid the ticket, so if your reason is that basic and shallow, it's not because of safety reasons. It's just because you don't want to fly with a woman, we'll gladly leave you behind."" Mbabazi refuses to let her critics win and is determined to continue being a role model for others. She hopes that her achievements can provide inspiration to other women who might not think they can attain their dreams jobs. ""Time has changed,"" she says. ""Women are out there working, technology has changed, and everyone has the brains to do something, now it's not about how much bicep or how much energy you have.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Organization of the Islamic Conference on Friday added its voice to the growing criticism of a film released by a Dutch lawmaker, which features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary general of the Jeddah, Saudi Arabia-based OIC, released a statement condemning ""in the strongest terms the release of the film 'Fitna' by Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders."" The organization added that the film defamed and denigrated ""the Holy Quran, causing insult to the sentiments of more than 1.3 billion Muslims in the world. ""The film was a deliberate act of discrimination against Muslims"" that aimed to ""provoke unrest and intolerance,"" the organization said. The OIC has 57 member states over four continents and claims on its Web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations. In its statement, it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the Dutch government to prosecute the author of the documentary under Dutch law. The 15-minute film, posted Thursday on a London-based Web site, has also drawn condemnation from the European Union and others. The European Union said the film inflames hatred, and Iran's Foreign Ministry called the movie ""anti-Islamic and insulting."" The foreign ministry called on the EU, the Netherlands, and Britain to take action to put an end to its showing, the official IRNA news agency reported. The Danish Union of Journalists said it was suing Wilders for using a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed drawn by one of its members, newspaper political cartoonist Kurt Westergaard. It said Wilders used the picture -- which shows Mohammed with a turban shaped like a bomb -- without permission. The film, titled ""Fitna,"" opens with Westergaard's controversial caricature, followed by translated portions of Islam's holy book, the Quran. The passages are interspersed with graphic images of the September 11 terrorist attacks juxtaposed with audio from 911 calls made by the victims trapped inside the World Trade Center in New York and other video clips. The video includes disturbing images of other terror attacks; bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional full-body attire; and footage, with subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians. The film concludes with scrolling messages reading in part: ""The government insists that you respect Islam, but Islam has no respect for you"" and ""In 1945, Nazism was defeated in Europe. In 1989, communism was defeated in Europe. Now the Islamic ideology has to be defeated."" Wilders, the filmmaker, is a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom. He has been outspoken in his criticism of Islam and called the religion a threat to the world. ""It's not a provocation, but the harsh reality and a political conclusion,"" Wilders said of the film Thursday. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad-Ali Hosseini on Friday condemned Wilders and the UK-based Web site hosting the film, LiveLeak.com, for showing the ""provocative and anti-Islamic movie."" ""He said such a 'dirty act' of the Dutch lawmaker and of a British institute at the end of the Islamic Unity Week reveals continued enmity and deep hostility of such western nationals against Islam and Muslims,"" IRNA reported. ""Warning against consequences of such 'provocative' acts, Hosseini asked the Dutch and British governments as well as (the) European Union to step in the case as soon as possible and prevent and put an end to showing of such (an) 'insulting, anti-Islamic and anti-cultural' film,"" IRNA wrote. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the film, calling it ""offensively anti-Islamic"" while urging calm. ""There is no justification for hate speech or incitement to violence,"" he said in a statement. ""The right of free expression is not at stake here."" Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said Thursday that the film equates Islam with violence. ""We reject this interpretation,"" Balkenende said in a statement. ""The vast majority of Muslims reject extremism and violence. In fact, the victims are often also Muslims."" Slovenia, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said Friday that it supports the Dutch government's position and believes the film does nothing to promote dialogue among religions. ""Mutual tolerance and respect are universal values we should uphold. We believe that acts, such as the above-mentioned film, serve no other purpose than inflaming hatred."" The U.S. government warned the film could spark protests and riots. The title of the film, ""Fitna,"" translates in Arabic to ""strife"" or ""conflict"" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. LiveLeak issued a statement Thursday saying there was no legal reason not to allow Wilders to post the film. It said the site's policy is to remain unbiased and allow freedom of speech. Some in the Muslim community rejected the film as nothing more than dangerous anti-Islamic propaganda. ""This film is a direct attempt to incite violence from Muslims and help fan the flames of Islamophobia,"" Arsalan Iftikhar, a contributor to Washington-based Islamica Magazine, told CNN on Thursday. ""Any reasonable person can see this is meant to spit in the face of Muslims and insult our religion."" Iftikhar said he doubted the film would spark the same type of violence that followed the publication of the caricature of Mohammed, but he called on Muslim leaders to react peacefully. Westergaard's caricature was one of a dozen printed in a Danish newspaper in late 2005. Violent protests erupted early the next year after other European newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech. Some Muslims believe the Quran forbids showing an image of the prophet.

"(CNN) -- Dr. Abdulmonem Hresha knows first hand how Moammar Gadhafi's regime works. He says the seeds of his opposition were sown when he was age 10. He and classmates were taken to witness the public execution of a political opponent of Gadhafi. ""They hung him up in front of thousands of small kids,"" Hresha said. ""He did that to scare people."" Hresha, who taught physics at Tripoli University, later fled to Canada. The prominent member of the Muslim Brotherhood now lives in London, and anticipates the group could become an important player in a post-Gadhafi environment. As in Egypt and Tunisia, the Brotherhood in Libya has been energized by the sudden upheaval sweeping the Arab world. It says it has no organizational links with the Brotherhood elsewhere, but shares the philosophy of the pan-Arab Islamist movement founded in Egypt in the 1920s. Largely drawn from the devout educated middle classes and university campuses in Tripoli and Benghazi, the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood was founded in the mid-1950s. Islamist opposition to the Libyan regime gathered force in the late 1980s, as part of a wider Islamic awakening or ""Sahwa"" in the region and in reaction to what many saw as an attempt by Gadhafi to hijack and interpret Islam for his own purposes. While jihadists launched a brief but unsuccessful campaign to overthrow Gadhafi in the 1990s, the Brotherhood focused much of its efforts on clandestine preaching and social welfare efforts in Libya.0 . In 1998, Gadhafi's security services launched a crackdown against the group that saw more than 200 members imprisoned and hundreds more forced into exile, including Hresha. Despite years of repression, Hresha claims the Brotherhood still has thousands of members scattered across Libya, with chapters in almost every single town, including Sirte, Gadhafi's birthplace on the coast west of Tripoli. In 2006, its leaders were released after reconciling with the Libyan regime. But now the Brotherhood is siding with the rebellion. In February, as protests in Libya began, Yusuf al Qaradawi -- an Egyptian preacher in Qatar widely viewed as the Muslim Brotherhood's chief spiritual guide -- issued a fatwa or religious ruling obliging any Libyan soldier who had the opportunity to do so to assassinate the leader. Al-Amin Bilhaj, a leading figure in the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood and the President of the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) recently traveled to Benghazi, the headquarters of the rebel movement, according to Hresha. Other Brotherhood exiles have returned to help treat the wounded in hospitals, according to Kemal el Helbawy, the Egyptian founder of the British association. There is little or no overt presence of the Brotherhood in Benghazi, according to CNN's Arwa Damon, who has been there for most of the month. But in the longer term, in a country where the political space has been dominated by Gadhafi for more than 40 years, the Brotherhood's organization and nationwide presence may afford it an advantage. The West has nothing to fear from the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya, according to Hresha. Like their counterparts in Egypt, they would embrace multiparty democracy. ""I've lived for many years in Canada and the UK, and that's exactly the political system that we want,"" Hresha said. Hresha says that if his organization forms a political party, it would seek to legislate according to Koranic principles, which would include, for example, a continued ban on the sale of alcohol. ""Why shouldn't we be able to press our point of view -- we are humans too,"" he said. Hresha said the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood welcomes airstrikes in Libya, a startling turnaround for a movement that previously supported jihad by Iraqis against U.S. forces occupying Iraq. ""I salute and am very grateful to the Americans, French and British governments for stopping the killing,"" he said. ""I will never forget this."" Hresha said he hopes a post-Gadhafi Libya will be a close friend to the West. A more prominent role for the Brotherhood in Libya could dent support for al Qaeda and other jihadist groups, especially in eastern provinces that have witnessed significant radicalization in recent years. But Libya's deeply tribal structures -- unlike Egypt and Tunisia -- may complicate its efforts to build a national base. And hardline ""Salafi"" preachers have gained influence in neglected towns like Derna -- on the coast near the border with Egypt. ""Conservative imams (in Derna),"" a U.S. diplomat wrote in 2008, ""deliberately sought to eliminate the few social activities on offer for young people to monopolize the social and cultural environment."" But in the end, the reach of the Brotherhood may be most limited by the emergence of secular forces at the forefront of the rebel movement. The Interim National Council in Benghazi -- a 30-member opposition leadership -- is mostly made up of lawyers, doctors, intellectuals and former political prisoners with a secular bent. In a statement Monday, the Council stated the ultimate goal of the revolution was ""to build a constitutional democratic civil state based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and the guarantee of equal rights and opportunities for all its citizens including ... equal opportunities between men and women and the promotion of women empowerment."" Guma el-Gamaty, a Libyan academic based in the UK who has emerged as a key liaison between the Libyan opposition overseas and the Benghazi Council said no Muslim Brotherhood leaders had yet been appointed to the Council, and played down their influence. Hresha, the long-time Brotherhood member, expects that to change. ""We've been working secretly till this moment,"" he said.","The Brotherhood in Libya is energized by the sudden upheaval sweeping the Arab world .
It says it has no organizational links with the Brotherhood elsewhere .
It is largely drawn from educated middle classes in Tripoli and Benghazi ."
"(CNN) -- The United States breached international law by executing a Mexican national without having granted him consular access, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said Friday. Navi Pillay, in a statement, said she deeply regrets the execution of Humberto Leal Garcia, after a 5-4 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court denied him a stay of execution Thursday night. ""The execution of Mr. Leal Garcia places the U.S. in breach of international law,"" said Pillay, who is on an official mission in Mexico. ""What the state of Texas has done in this case is imputable in law to the U.S. and engages the United States' international responsibility."" Pillay said Leal was not granted consular access, which -- as a foreign national -- was his right under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The denial of access raises concerns about whether Leal got a fair trial, Pillay said. Leal, who was convicted for the 1994 rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl, was executed Thursday evening by lethal injection in Texas. Federal officials, including the Obama administration, had tried to persuade Texas Gov. Rick Perry to delay the execution. ""The secretary herself is quite disappointed in the outcome in this case,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Neuland about Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""The U.S. government sought a stay of Leal's execution in order to give the Congress time to act on the Consular Notification Compliance Act, which would have provided Leal the judicial review required by international law."" Neuland said the case underscores the importance of the act's passage. ""If we don't protect the rights of non-Americans in the United States, we seriously risk reciprocal lack of access to our own citizens overseas,"" she said. ""I am sorry for everything I have done,"" Leal said at the Huntsville facility before he was executed. ""I have hurt a lot of people. Let this be final and be done. I take the full blame for this."" Leal then shouted ""Viva Mexico,"" followed by ""I'm ready warden, let's get the show on the road."" Mexico condemned the execution, saying it violated an International Court of Justice ruling ordering the United States to review capital convictions of Mexican nationals. The U.S. Supreme Court earlier denied a stay of execution by 5-4, despite pleas from the Obama administration and the Mexican government to delay the execution. In an unsigned opinion by the majority, the court refused to delay the execution until Congress could pass pending legislation giving federal courts the authority to hear similar claims from foreign inmates. ""We decline to follow the United States' suggestion of granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on hypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any prospect of success,"" said the majority. In their dissent, the four justices, led by Stephen Breyer, urged that Leal's execution be delayed. ""It is difficult to see how the state's interest in the immediate execution of an individual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago can outweigh the considerations that support additional delay, perhaps only until the end of the summer,"" said Breyer, who was supported by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Sandra Babcock, lead appellate attorney, said, ""It is shameful that Mr. Leal will pay the price for our inaction. The need for congressional action to restore our reputation and protect our citizens is more urgent than ever."" ""This case was not just about one Mexican national on death row in Texas,"" Babcock said in a statement. ""The execution of Mr. Leal violates the United States' treaty commitments, threatens the nation's foreign policy interests, and undermines the safety of all Americans abroad."" The state's Board of Pardons and Parole ruled that Leal did not deserve to have his death sentence commuted to life in prison without parole. The victim's mother, Rachel Terry, had called for the execution to go ahead as planned. ""A technicality doesn't give anyone a right to come to this country and rape, torture and murder anyone, in this case my daughter,"" she told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio. ""It's been difficult for myself and her family members,"" she added. ""She certainly was taken away from us at a very young age. We just want closure."" Leal's lawyers argued the consulate access violation was more than a technicality. Babcock told CNN that Mexican officials would have ensured Leal would have had the most competent trial defense possible had they been able to speak with him immediately after he was arrested. ""I think in most of these cases it was not a deliberate thing,"" Babcock said. ""Local police lack training"" on the Vienna Convention, she added, referring to the international agreement that mandates consular access. Leal's backers say he had learning disabilities and brain damage and had been sexually abused by his parish priest. They say those factors should have been considered at his sentencing. The Mexican government had filed a supporting appeal with the high court in Washington, asking the justices to block Leal's execution. And on Friday, the Obama administration asked Texas to delay the execution. ""This case implicates United States foreign policy interests of the highest order,"" including protecting U.S. citizens abroad and promoting good relations with other countries, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said. Congress has also weighed in. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill in June to grant federal courts the power to review such appeals. ""This case is not an isolated instance; the issue of consular notification remains a serious diplomatic and legal concern,"" Leahy said Thursday. In Texas, Perry's office countered that a federal appeals court had already given Leal the judicial scrutiny the Obama administration and the United Nations were seeking. ""If you commit the most heinous of crimes in Texas, you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws,"" Katherine Cesinger, spokeswoman for the governor, told CNN. ""Congress has had the opportunity to consider and pass legislation for the federal courts' review of such cases since 2008, and has not done so each time a bill was filed."" Ted Cruz, the state's former solicitor general who argued the 2008 Supreme Court case for Texas, said Leal waited too long to raise these issues. ""The question is not should a foreign national have the right to contact their consulate,"" Cruz told CNN. ""The question is, years later, after they have been tried, after they have been convicted, after it has been clear like Humberto Leal that they are a vicious child rapist and murderer, should you come in and set aside that conviction. You can't come back years later and try and set aside your trial with some additional claim you wish you had raised."" Cruz is running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican candidate.","The U.N.

"(CNN) -- Should Ulysses S. Grant, the legendary Union general and 18th president of the United States, be bumped from his 96-year stint on the $50 bill? Yes, according to one North Carolina Republican. Rep. Patrick McHenry announced that he will introduce a measure that would replace Grant's face with Ronald Reagan's, just in time for the 40th president's 100th birthday next February. ""President Reagan was a modern day statesman, whose presidency transformed our nation's political and economic thinking,"" McHenry said in a statement. ""Through both his domestic and international policies he renewed America's self confidence, defeated the Soviets and taught us that each generation must provide opportunity for the next."" McHenry says it's only logical for Reagan to replace Grant on the $50 bill because several historians have ranked Reagan as a much better president than Grant. McHenry specifically cites a 2005 Wall Street Journal survey of scholars who placed Reagan at No. 6 and Grant at No. 29. ""Every generation needs its own heroes,"" McHenry also said. ""One decade into the 21st century, it's time to honor the last great president of the 20th and give President Reagan a place beside Presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy."" Franklin Roosevelt's face currently appears on the dime while John F. Kennedy's image is on the half-dollar. But not so fast, says Dr. John Marszalek, the executive director and managing editor of the Ulysses S. Grant Association. Calling him a ""beacon"" of the 19th century, Marszalek said Grant deserves to keep his prominent spot on America's currency. ""His work in battling against inflation and getting the currency on stable footing opened the way for the economy boom of the late 19th century, Marszalek told CNN. ""I don't know why he wouldn't be included, except people forget. It's been a long time."" Marszalek also named a host of other Grant accomplishments, including efforts to promote the rights of freed slaves and native Americans, as well as his post-presidency, two-year tour of the world during which he negotiated the settlement of a dispute between Japan and China. But the Grant administration was also beset by major scandals -- close to a dozen in all -- which is a primary reason that Grant had difficulty working with Congress and why many modern historians continue to rank the 18th president relatively low. Still, Marszalek says Grant's death in 1885 was a ""national phenomenon"" and is ""still the biggest funeral any American has had to this day."" Grant supporters can rest easy for now, though -- the future of the legislation is highly in doubt. It would first have to clear the House Financial Services Committee where at least one Democrat is already expressing his opposition to the move. ""History has made its verdict,"" Rep. Brad Sherman of California told CNN. ""Reagan's policies are controversial. Grant was in favor of winning the Civil War and keeping the Union together. The currency is not a place to score cheap political points."" It's not the first time Republican lawmakers have sought to immortalize Reagan's image on American currency. In 2004, Rep. Mark Souder introduced legislation to put Reagan on the dime in place of Roosevelt. Souder dropped the move after Nancy Reagan publicly opposed the measure. In the years since Reagan's death, GOP lawmakers have also considered, though abandoned, legislation placing Reagan on the $10 bill, in place of Alexander Hamilton, and on the $20 bill, in place of Andrew Jackson.","Congressman says he will introduce a measure to put Reagan's face on the $50 bill .

"A prominent Philadelphia businessman and philanthropist was among seven people killed Saturday when their private plane crashed on takeoff in Massachusetts. Lewis Katz had purchased the parent company of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Philadelphia Daily News and CNN affiliate philly.com just days before the crash. He was 72. ""It is with an incomprehensible amount of grief and the heaviest of hearts that my sister and I announce the loss of our beloved dad,"" Drew Katz said in a statement Sunday. ""My father was my best friend. He taught me everything. He never forgot where and how he grew up, and he worked tirelessly to support his community in countless ways that were seen and unseen."" Katz was formerly the principal owner of the NBA's New Jersey Nets and the NHL's New Jersey Devils. He was a shareholder of the Nets, the New York Yankees and the YES Network at the time of his death. ""The New York Yankees are deeply saddened by the tragic passing of Lewis Katz "" managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner said in a statement. ""Lewis was a minority owner of the Yankees and a valued, long-time friend and colleague to so many of us within the organization. He will forever be remembered."" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called Lewis -- who took the Nets to the franchise's first ever visit to the NBA finals in 2002-2003 -- ""a trusted friend and valued member of the NBA family."" ""All of us at the NBA were extremely saddened to learn of the tragic, sudden death of former Nets owner Lewis Katz. He was a visionary businessman who touched the lives of so many with his tireless pursuit of innovation and enterprise, as well as his deep commitment to his family, friends and community."" Silver said in a statement Sunday. Katz, who was an attorney in addition to his business ventures, was also a prolific philanthropist. His alma mater, Temple University, announced that it would rename the medical school in his honor after a $25 million gift in 2013. Two buildings at Pennsylvania State University -- where Katz went to law school -- also bear his name. Katz was also active in his native Camden, New Jersey, where he founded two charter schools and supported a number of charities as well as youth, educational, religious and civic causes. Katz flew to Massachusetts earlier Saturday to attend a fund-raising event at the Boston-area home of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.  She said she had dinner with him Saturday evening before he left for his flight back to Atlantic City, New Jersey. ""He was a force of nature,"" Goodwin said of her friend of 20 years in a statement. ""So deep was his commitment to education reform that he flew to Concord to support my son Michael's Concord River institute. Afterward we all went to dinner, where we talked at length about our shared passions for sports and journalism, politics and history. But the last thing he said to me upon leaving for the plane was that most of all what we shared was our love and pride for our children. I have lost a great friend, his family has lost a great father and grandfather, and the country has lost a great man."" Luke Schiada, an air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said the Gulfstream IV with two pilots, one flight attendant and four passengers attempted to take off at 9:40 p.m. Saturday from Hanscom Field, about 20 miles northwest of Boston. Only the plane never got airborne, according to Schiada: It  crashed through a chain-link fence and went down an embankment before winding up in a gully approximately 2,000 feet from the end of the paved runway surface.  He said a ""significant post-crash fire"" consumed much of the plane. The NTSB announced Monday that the plane's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder had been recovered. Middlesex County District Attorney Marian Ryan identified the plane's pilot as 52-year-old James McDowell of Georgetown, Delaware, the co-pilot as 45-year-old Michael De Vries of Marlton, New Jersey; and the flight attendant as Teresa Benhoff, 48, of Easton, Maryland. The three passengers traveling with Katz were also identified by Ryan's office Monday as New Jersey residents Susan Asbell, 68, Marcella Dalsey, 59, and Anne Leeds, 74.  All three were his close associates, according to philly.com. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell told CNN that Katz had invited him to the event and that he would have been on the doomed flight had it not been for a previous commitment.  ""You feel a loss like this on so many different areas,"" he said. ""We lost one of our best civic leaders (and) our greatest philanthropist."" Rendell also said that he lost his close friend.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Suraya Pakzad still receives death threats for teaching women how to read and write in Taliban-controlled parts of Afghanistan. Suraya Pakzad tells CNN any deal between the U.S. and Taliban moderates should consider women's concerns. ""[When] I go to the office I don't use the same way ... every day,"" she told CNN's Carol Costello. ""I cannot share my schedule even with my friends, with my staff and even sometimes I'm not secure talking on phone."" Pakzad is one of several Afghan women's rights advocates who are in the U.S. capital this week to address a move the Obama administration is considering: reaching out to Taliban moderates in an effort to bring peace to Afghanistan. She took part in a hearing on Capitol Hill -- sponsored by Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, and Richard Lugar, R-Indiana -- titled ""Women Shaping Afghanistan's Future."" Last weekend, President Obama told The New York Times that he is willing to talk to some members of the Taliban. Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday that he agreed with a recent assessment by Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke that only about 5 percent of the Taliban is ""incorrigible, not susceptible to anything other than being defeated."" ""It is worth engaging and determining whether or not there are those [in the Taliban] who are willing to participate in a secure and stable Afghan state,"" he said. But Pakzad wants U.S. lawmakers to put women's rights at the forefront of any deal with Taliban moderates. She warned that the negotiations described by Obama and Biden could threaten the hard-won gains in women's rights in Afghanistan over the past seven years. ""It makes me scared and everybody has the fear that one day [the Taliban] will be back again,"" Pakzad said.  Watch Pakzad describe what females face in Afghanistan » . Pakzad, a mother of six, founded a secret organization in 1988 to provide Afghan women with shelter from domestic violence and to teach them to read. The Taliban advocate a strict interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, that denies women basic rights, including an education. When the Taliban were driven from power in 2001, Pakzad's Voice of Women Organization emerged from secrecy to expand its efforts to give women rights in the home, schools, the workplace, and the legislature. She was recognized for her efforts last year when she was awarded the 2008 International Women of Courage Award. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will bestow the honor on eight other women on Wednesday, including Wazhma Frogh, an Afghan woman who heads Global Rights, which fights against domestic violence, marital and child rape, and sexual abuse in Afghanistan. By one measure, Pakzad and other women's rights groups have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams: The government in Kabul says 2 million girls now attend school in Afghanistan. But even now, women are still targets of domestic violence, and Afghan girls have been attacked for attending school. During her confirmation hearings, Clinton condemned one brutal attack in which men on motorcycles threw acid on two schoolgirls in November. ""This is not culture,"" Clinton said. ""This is not custom. This is criminal."" Pakzad expresses hope that Clinton and other members of the Obama administration will raise those concerns when moving forward with any policy of negotiating with the Taliban. She said she hopes that one day, Afghan women will secure the same rights that American women have achieved. ""My hope for my daughters, for the next generation ... is that they should enjoy their freedom,"" she said. ""[I] hope they have a country free of inequality, free of violence against women, and hopefully they will get that opportunity.""

"A U.S. airstrike has killed the head of intelligence and security for the Al-Shabaab terrorist organization in Somalia, Tahlil Abdishakur, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Unmanned aircraft fired Hellfire missiles at a vehicle carrying him near Saakow, in southern Somalia, the Pentagon said in a statement. ""His death will significantly impact Al-Shabaab's ability to conduct attacks against the government of the Federal Republic of Somalia, the Somali people, and U.S. allies and interests in the region,"" the statement said. The United States designated Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organization in 2008. It has blamed the group for deadly bombings and other attacks that have killed scores of people. A U.S. strike killed Ahmed Godane, co-founder of Al-Shabaab, a few months ago, the Pentagon has said.","Unmanned aircraft fired missiles at a vehicle carrying the terrorist leader, the Pentagon said .
The strike targeted the head of intelligence and security for Al-Shabaab .
The U.S. designated Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organization in 2008 ."
"Ahmed Godane, the leader of the Somali militant group Al-Shabaab, was killed this week in a U.S. military operation, the Pentagon said Friday. ""The U.S. military undertook operations against Godane on Sept. 1, which led to his death. Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to Al-Shabaab,""  said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby. On Monday, U.S. military conducted a strike in the African country targeting Godane, who had pledged allegiance to al Qaeda. He headed Al-Shabaab as it terrorized East Africa, killing Somali officials, aid workers and others in a spate of suicide bombings. Godane allegedly was behind 2013's deadly siege of a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall. Before this week's strike, the U.S. military was tipped off to what Kirby called ""actionable intelligence ... strong enough"" to suggest Godane's whereabouts. In response, U.S. commandos flew -- aided by drones -- into an area south of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, around 6:20 p.m. (11:20 a.m. ET) Monday. Abdikadir Mohamed Nur Sidii, governor of Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, characterized the attack near the port city of Barawe as so ferocious ""it jolted the entire region."" Sidii said, ""I never heard such a huge and deafening blast as the result of the airstrike."" Earlier this week, Kirby didn't elaborate on how much firepower was involved, beyond the use of Hellfire and laser-guided missiles. Somali intelligence officials counted at least four such missiles. After the attack, an Al-Shababb Twitter account said one person was killed but asserted it wasn't Godane. ""'Ahmed Abdi Godane' is alive and doing fine,"" the tweet said, calling itself an ""official mujahedin account"" in the Islamic land of Somalia. At the time, CNN was unable to verify the authenticity of that claim on Twitter. The man behind Al-Shabaab . Godane, who was also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, became the leader of Al-Shabaab in 2008. Traditionally, Al-Shabaab focused on bringing Islamic rule to Somalia, attracting dozens of ethnic Somalis -- and a few Westerners -- from the United States and Europe. But last year Godane seemed to be refocusing the group on terrorist attacks beyond Somalia -- against East African states supporting the Somali government, especially Uganda and Kenya, and against Western interests in East Africa. The September 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Kenya's capital was Al-Shabaab's most audacious, but the massacre that left 67 people dead wasn't the group's first strike outside Somalia. In 2010, Al-Shabaab carried out suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, in which more than 70 people were killed. Still, the Westgate siege demonstrated Godane's desire to align his group more closely with al Qaeda. In a taped message afterward, he noted the attack took place ""just 10 days after the anniversary date of the blessed 9/11 operations."" Under Godane, Al-Shabaab became a formal ally of al Qaeda. The move led to dissent in the group, which Godane dealt with ruthlessly, using his control of Al-Shabaab's intelligence wing. The American jihadist Omar Hammami was reportedly killed in September 2013 after criticizing Godane's leadership and his treatment of foreign fighters. Godane was said to be 37 years old, and was originally from Somaliland in northern Somalia. He was slim to the point of wispy, as seen in the few photographs of him, and preferred recording audio messages to appearing in public. A former Somali prime minister, Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, once described Godane as the cleverest of Al-Shabaab's leaders. The U.S. government's Rewards for Justice program listed him under another alias, Ahmed Abdi Aw-Mohamed, and offered up to $7 million last year for information leading to his location.","Ahmed Godane was the leader of Somali militant group Al-Shabaab .

"(CNN) -- In a second Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address delivered on behalf of Tea Party activists Tuesday night, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann asserted that ""Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that tells us which light bulbs to buy, and which may put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill."" Fact Check: Will 16,500 Internal Revenue Service agents police the health care bill? The number seems to have originated in a GOP committee report last spring, based on a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office that between $5 billion and $10 billion would be required to administer the health care bill. Working backward from the higher CBO number, the Republicans asserted that the money would be spent on 16,500 new IRS employees, including ""additional auditors, agents and other employees ..."" But IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman testified to Congress in March 2010 that the IRS would not audit taxpayers to make sure they have bought health insurance. Instead, he said IRS employees would be focused on making sure the public knew about tax incentives in the legislation. Shulman conceded that some new employees would be required to support the agency's work on the health care bill. But he said during an appearance at the National Press Club in April that he didn't know yet how many. The most recent data from the IRS, from 2009, shows that the service has 93,337 employees, of whom 14,264 are revenue agents and an additional 2,725 are special agents. That's a current total of 16,989 agents to handle all investigations and taxpayer audits conducted by the IRS. And Bachmann went further than asserting that 16,500 employees would be hired -- she said 16,500 IRS agents may be ""in charge of policing"" the health care bill. But the health care bill specifically says that taxpayers who do not buy insurance ""shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure."" And 16,500 agents would require the IRS to almost double its force of agents or divert nearly all its current agents from their existing audit and investigative duties. Either seems far-fetched, given the provisions of the health care bill that prohibit criminal prosecution or penalty of taxpayers who do not meet its provisions. Bottom line: . Congresswoman Bachmann's assertion is, at best, misleading. CNN's Richard Griffiths and Katie Glaeser contributed to this report.","Bachmann says an army of IRS agents will be used to enforce the health care law .

"The high-stakes fight over implementing parts of the troubled health care reform law will move to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months, in a dispute involving coverage for contraceptives and religious liberty. The justices agreed on Tuesday to review provisions in the Affordable Care Act requiring employers of a certain size to offer insurance coverage for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay. At issue is whether private companies can refuse to do so on the claim it violates their religious beliefs. Oral arguments will likely be held in March with a ruling by late June. Nearly 50 pending lawsuits have been filed in federal court from various corporations challenging the birth control coverage benefits in the ""Obamacare"" law championed by President Barack Obama, which has come in for fierce political criticism over its rocky public introduction. The high court last year narrowly upheld the key funding provision of the health care law, a blockbuster ruling affirming that most Americans would be required to purchase insurance or pay a financial penalty -- the so-called ""individual mandate."" The constitutional debate now shifts to the separate employer mandates and whether corporations themselves enjoy the same First Amendment rights as individuals. Three federal appeals courts around the country have struck down the contraception coverage rule, while two other appeals courts have upheld it. That ""circuit split"" made a Supreme Court review more likely. The Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases involving for-profit corporations. Among the plaintiffs is Hobby Lobby, Inc. a nationwide chain of about 500 arts and crafts stores. Hobby Lobby finds way around $1.3-million-a-day Obamacare hit - for now . David Green and his family are the owners and say their Christian beliefs clash with parts of the law's mandates for comprehensive coverage. They say some of the drugs that would be provided prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman's womb, which the Greens equate to abortion. The privately held company does not object to funding other forms of contraception -- such as condoms and diaphragms -- for their roughly 13,000 employees, which Hobby Lobby says represent a variety of faiths. Companies that refuse to provide the coverage could be fined up to $1.3 million daily. Kyle Duncan, general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and lead lawyer for Hobby Lobby, called the Supreme Court decision to hear the case a ""major step"" for the Greens and their business, and ""an important fight for Americans' religious liberty."" Opinion: Religious liberty is for people, not corporations . The White House said on Tuesday that it believes a requirement on contraceptives is ""lawful and essential to women's health."" The White House added that it is ""confident the Supreme Court will agree."" The Obama administration has defended the law and federal officials say they have already created rules exempting certain nonprofits and religiously affiliated organizations from the contraceptives requirements. In those cases, women would receive coverage from another company at no cost. The Supreme Court was asked to take up the issue by a private Christian university in Virginia but the court, without explanation, decided not to hear that appeal. The law's supporters say it does not require individual company owners to personally provide coverage they might object, but instead places that responsibility on the corporate entity. A key issue for the justices will be interpreting the 1993 federal law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Can companies, churches, and universities be included, or do the protections apply only to ""persons?"" The botched rollout of HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website, has become a political flashpoint along with other issues that Republicans say proves the law is unworkable.

But listen to him tell his story, take a look around his space, and you might agree that there's no more accurate way of representing the world than with holography.

His laser lighting has been used at the original Studio 54, on CBS, in print advertising for Macy's and Revlon, on Broadway, for book and magazine covers, and a number of music videos, including a starring role in one by ""Flock of Seagulls"" which landed him the first on-air credit in a video on MTV.

"Before Saturday's police shooting of an African-American teenager, Ferguson, Missouri, was known as one of hundreds of municipalities designated by a national nonprofit as a ""Playful City USA,"" a place where children are supposed to have access to more opportunities to play in their communities. But the shooting death of Michael Brown, a college-bound 18-year-old, by a police officer has brought national attention to the mostly black community for another reason. Witnesses and residents say the young man was unarmed. Police say he tried to take an officer's gun. Authorities, citing threats and safety issues, have refused to identify the officer. Protests have turned violent. Tensions remain high after isolated looting incidents and dozens of arrests in the St. Louis suburb of 22,400. To locals and longtime observers, the tension has been brewing since the 1970s, when Ferguson underwent a racial transformation. Once predominantly white, the city became overwhelmingly black as white families moved out during the racial integration of public schools.   At the same time, many African-American families started to move to Ferguson from St. Louis and surrounding communities. ""This whole situation has been boiling for a while,"" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who lives five miles from Ferguson. ""It's not just the death of Michael Brown but the way it's been handled by the local government and the response to the community's outrage that forced this to boil over."" A white man's response to Ferguson . On Thursday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon acknowledged long-simmering tensions between the community and police. ""This feels a little like an old wound that has been hit again,"" he said. ""The key to this is ... ultimately getting to some of these deeper problems. These are deep and existing problems not only in Missouri but in America. This has clearly touched a nerve, and that nerve is not merely from this horrific incident that happened just a few short days ago."" Advocates for effective policing contend that law enforcement should reflect the diversity of the community it polices. When that is out of balance, however, an incident such as the Brown shooting can cause tensions to boil over. What's happening in Ferguson today is a perfect example, said Beryl Satter, a history professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey. ""This is what happens when you have massive racial change in a community and the power structure remains in the hands of whites and the police force acts as this sort of mediating force between the white power structure and what is now a black community and has very little empathy or knowledge about that community."" Racial disparity . Two-thirds of Ferguson's population is black, and yet the mayor is white, and so are five of the six city council members. The police chief is also white. There are only three African-Americans on the 53-person police force. ""This all gets back to segregation,"" Satter said. ""The school boards, the police force, the juvenile courts remain the same. The population changes before the power structure changes. ... It happened across the country when there was very rapid resegregation of a town, a neighborhood or a city."" Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson admitted Wednesday that diversity on the force was a ""constant struggle"" but said race relations were a top priority for his department. He also said the officer who shot Brown was assaulted before opening fire on the young man. According to a 2013 report released by the Missouri attorney general, African-Americans are not under-represented in crime statistics.  They accounted for 93% of arrests after traffic stops, 92% of searches and 86% of traffic stops. The St. Louis area has always been one of the most racially segregated regions in the country, according to Satter and other experts. It was in St. Louis that a federal judge in 1847 returned Dred Scott to slavery in a decision upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that African-Americans were not American citizens and could not sue in federal court. Deadly race riots erupted in East St. Louis in the early 1900s. The looting and angry protests that followed Brown's death, Satter said, are part of the ""historical lineage of violence and segregation."" While all the facts surrounding the Brown shooting have yet to come out, Satter said, the disconnect between the community and law enforcement can have lasting effects. ""It's just a terrible spiral of oppression,"" she said. ""The reaction of rioting in response to police brutality is classic. It's so personal. Other kinds of oppression that black people face, say in the school or other places, it's not on your body. It's not as personally invasive. But police brutality hurts in a sharper, more profound and immediate way. People can relate to what happened to this boy."" Racial profiling training . Jackson told CNN this week that he was working to improve the diversity of the force. Racial profiling, he said, was ""strictly forbidden."" ""We actually have mandatory racial profiling training that we have to take to be certified,"" he said. ""Racial profiling is against our policies. It actually benefits nothing."" David Klinger, a criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a former Los Angeles police officer, said that a more diverse police force doesn't always translate into better police relations with a community. ""If the cops are not treating the citizens appropriately, is it a question of the cops not doing their job right because they're not trained well or they're knuckleheads or they hold racial animus?"" he said. ""Who knows? But if you bore down and it turns out that there's racial animus, then you have a real big problem on top of the lack of professionalism, because that's a flashpoint in our society. We have a rough history in America regarding race relations. And the police, unfortunately, have been on the wrong side of that."" Dan Isom, retired chief of police in St. Louis and a criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the diversity of the police rank and file and command definitely affects community relations. ""When you look across the nation, it's not uncommon for police departments to have a racial makeup that is not consistent with the community,"" he said. ""You don't have a political or community push for improvement until something like the Michael Brown shooting happens."" According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,  about a quarter of police officers across the nation were ethnic minorities in 2007, compared with a sixth of officers in 1987. Isom hopes the tragedy leads to change. ""There are so many questions to be asked beyond just the shooting,"" Isom said. ""Certainly, the police department's makeup, the relationship with the community. Hopefully, this brings a bigger conversation: Why does this happen in the African-American community? What are the deeper issues we have to resolve between communities and police?"" Other factors about Ferguson need to be considered, observers said. According to the 2010 census, community residents are mostly young; the average age is 31. Median household income is $37,000: about $10,000 less than Missouri as a whole. About one-fifth of Ferguson residents live in poverty. African-Americans are much worse off economically than whites, with a 25% poverty rate that's more than twice that of whites, according to the most recent government estimates from two years ago. Their median income is only about 60% that of their white counterparts. ""Ferguson's black community is a very transient community, living in rental housing,"" said French, the St. Louis alderman. ""Not many people register to vote, and even less participate in elections. ... People are living day to day out there, and part of their daily existence is negative encounters with the police. They want to be heard. They want their frustration to be recognized."" Complete coverage on Michael Brown's shooting .

"Phallic good luck charms, wooden buildings, an amber gladiator amulet, even documents -- all these are among a huge trove of Roman artifacts preserved by a lost river in London's financial district, archaeologists said Wednesday. The find has given an extraordinary glimpse into the bustling everyday life of Londinium, as the Roman city was known, the Museum of London Archaeology said. In the course of six months, the team has removed 3,500 metric tons of soil by hand and revealed some 10,000 finds covering the entire period of the Roman occupation of Britain, from around 40 AD to the early 5th century. Among them are leather objects and wooden walls standing to shoulder height, as well as timber plank floors. These materials rarely survive the tests of time, leading archaeologists to dub the site the ""Pompeii of the north,"" the Museum of London Archaeology said. Among the finds is a mysterious leather object depicting a gladiator fighting mythical creatures that may have once adorned a chariot, it said. ""The site is a wonderful slice through the first four centuries of London's existence,"" said Sophie Jackson of the Museum of London Archaeology. ""The waterlogged conditions left by the Walbrook Stream have given us layer upon layer of Roman timber buildings, fences and yards, all beautifully preserved and containing amazing personal items, clothes and even documents -- all of which will transform our understanding of the people of Roman London."" London rail excavation unearths suspected 'plague pit' The dig is taking place in Bloomberg Place, a three-acre site in the heart of the Roman city of London and home to the Temple of Mithras, built in the 3rd century. The temple was discovered during building work in 1954 but excavations for the construction of Bloomberg's new European headquarters have revealed new remains. These include a previously unexcavated section of the temple, as well as rubbish and ritual deposits from the Walbrook, including Roman coins. Among the haul is what the museum says is the largest group of fist and phallus good luck charms ever recovered from one site. A hoard of pewter, coins and cow skulls thrown into a Roman well as part of a ritual have also been unearthed, as well as the remains of a complex Roman drainage system used to carry waste from industrial buildings into the Walbrook, one of London's lost rivers, covered over and redirected by centuries of development. Experts will also examine nearly 700 boxes of pottery pieces, as well as more than 100 fragments of Roman writing tablets recovered from the site. The current excavations started with the dismantling of a 1960s reconstruction of the Temple of Mithras, a popular visitor attraction when it opened. At the peak of the dig, more than 60 archaeologists were working at the site. When work on the new Bloomberg headquarters is completed, the reconstructed Temple of Mithras and finds from the current excavation will be put on public display there.

"(CNN)I obey the speed limit, use turn signals, and don't cruise around with broken tail lights. I don't have substance-abuse problems, unless you count Diet Dr. Pepper. I live in a safe neighborhood, and no one in my family has a criminal record. I like to think all of that is why I spend virtually no time worrying about the police. Yet there's another big reason: I'm white. The way most white people see the police, and the way most black people see them, is separated by a gap so wide it may as well be a canyon. That gulf has been cast into sharp relief by events in Ferguson, Missouri, where a grand jury declined to indict white police officer Darren Wilson in the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. That sparked protests around the country, as did a decision in New York not to indict a white police officer in the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who police confronted while investigating allegations that he was selling cigarettes illegally. Those cases collectively have come to stand as a kind of national Rorschach inkblot test, with people looking at the same events and reaching different conclusions. Some people adopted the phrase ""black lives matter"" to protest police treatment of minorities, while others countered with ""police lives matter,"" and -- maybe in search of a more universal middle ground -- ""all lives matter."" People immortalized Garner's last words -- ""I can't breathe"" -- on T-shirts and protest signs and social media posts. Those on the other side of the national divide fired back with slogans such as ""I can breathe"" and ""Breathe Easy, Obey the Law,"" arguing that if you just obey the law, you will avoid encounters with the police altogether. One of our latest CNN/ORC polls put numbers on the gap in public opinion. Asked ""How many police officers in the area where you live ... are prejudiced against blacks?"" 17% of whites said ""most or some,"" but more than twice as many non-whites -- 42% -- felt that way. ""Does the U.S. criminal justice system treat whites and blacks equally?"" Whites: 50% said yes, compared to 21% of non-whites. True, plenty of blacks and whites buck those trends, and no racial group can be treated as a monolith in these matters, but leanings -- writ large -- remain. Those opinions may grow out of the fact that police tend to arrest blacks at rates disproportionate to their share in the general population. FBI figures, for example, show that blacks made up 28% of all people arrested in 2013; they make up about 13% of the U.S.  population. But plenty of people have long suggested those numbers are deceiving; that police pursue black suspects more vigorously because they are predisposed to believe blacks are guilty, and those suspects are often less educated and not as financially prepared to defend themselves. The result, they argue, is a self-fulfilling prophecy: a larger percentage of blacks are arrested and convicted because police spend more time chasing them down. Accordingly, when an unarmed teen gets shot and killed by a cop in Missouri, or a man in New York dies after being choked by an officer, some people see evidence of police targeting and brutalizing minorities. Still, facts often fit into this debate like broken Legos, if at all. In both Ferguson and New York, police supporters point out that the men who died were being approached about possible criminal behavior and did not do what the officers asked of them. That's a formula for trouble, they say, regardless of race. Want more complications? Consider this: About a quarter of the nation's officers come from minority groups, and they too are making those arrests that so disturb some people in minority communities. That suggests this friction may be partially about black and white, but also tied to a pro-police mentality that sees blue first. And by the way, there are still plenty of places like Ferguson where the overwhelming prevalence of white officers in a largely black community creates a feeling of apartheid for some minority residents. It all plays out in so many heated ways. Protestors flood the streets and some observers see overdue demands for change, while others see pointless rabble-rousing and destruction. In New York, officers turned their backs on Mayor Bill DeBlasio on the grounds that he supported protesters outraged by the grand jury decision not to indict a police officer in Garner's death. Anger at the mayor deepened after two New York police officers were killed in ambush by a man who had posted on Instagram: ""I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today. They Take 1 Of Ours, Let's Take 2 of Theirs."" Some see well-founded, fair objections, while others see brazen disrespect. On it goes, each action honestly generated from within a worldview, and yet seen in a wildly different way by those who use another lens. The divergent views were captured neatly after a Facebook post from Mike Rowe, who stars in the CNN series ""Somebody's Gotta Do It."" Someone asked what he thought of the protests in California triggered by events in Ferguson. He said those protests made him 90 minutes late for a holiday dinner in Alameda, California, where the deaths of Brown and Garner dominated conversation. ""My conservative friends were focused on the fact that both men died while resisting arrest, and were therefore responsible for their own demise. They wanted to discuss the killings in light of the incredible risk that all police officers agree to assume,"" Rowe wrote. ""My liberal friends were focused on the fact that both men were unarmed, and were therefore victims of excessive force. They wanted to discuss the killings in the context of historical trends that suggest bias plays a recurring role in the way cops treat minorities."" He said it was clear by dessert that both sides wanted law and order. ""But the conservatives were convinced that order is only possible when citizens treat cops with respect. Liberals, on the other hand, were arguing that order can only occur when cops treat everyone the same,"" he wrote. ""And round and round we went."" More than 115,000 people offered a range of views in their comments on Rowe's Facebook post. Nearly 65,000 people shared the post, with each spawning more comments from more people with more views. When these events happen, people always say ""At least we're talking about the problems. That's a start."" I'm not so sure. I've covered versions of this debate for close to 40 years now, and it hasn't changed much. Some are so convinced of police bigotry, they will not stomach the slightest allowance that maybe officers are taking on a hard, dangerous job in which judgment calls can be fairly made and still wind up fatally wrong. Some others are so certain that this is all just so much liberal whining, that they cannot tolerate even a reasonable review of police conduct, suggesting that it constitutes an erosion of respect and support for people they consider de facto heroes. I suspect if any real progress is to be made in this national discussion, it will have to be started by people who don't fully buy into either camp. And the discussion probably can't include poisoning phrases like ""black underclass"" or ""white privilege,"" because those are conversation stoppers -- not starters. The man who helped me get my first job in television was an excellent investigative journalist named Norman Lumpkin. He made his reputation as a rare African-American TV reporter in Montgomery, Alabama, grappling with inept public officials, scheming businessmen, and, yes, shady cops. He was my friend and mentor. One day Norman called me aside to criticize a story I'd just done on divorces, noting that I had not included any black families. I took offense. ""This isn't a story about race,"" I said. ""It's always about race,"" Norman said. ""Well, I don't judge people that way."" ""We all do."" I've thought of that clash many times, especially since Norman passed away, and I've concluded I was right to try to ignore race in a story that was about human values we all share. He was equally right to say race has a way of creeping into places where it doesn't belong; like divorces, politics, and police work. And we were collectively right in trying to actually talk about our differences, instead of accusing each other and lapsing into hardened silence. Neither of us was being racist. We were trying, as friends do, to help each other understand. But then, Norman and I already knew we could trust each other. And in too many places, police and the people they are sworn to protect, are not so sure of that.","Whites and blacks tend to have different views of race and police .

"Hajar Hamdan lives with her mother, sister and her sister's two children in the concrete jungle of Deheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem in the West Bank. Yet Hamdan is growing enough vegetables on her roof to feed her family and pass the surplus on to her neighbors. Hamdan's family is one of 15 in Deheishe to have a greenhouse on their roof as part of a project which is now being extended to other Palestinian refugee camps. Money is tight with no wage-earners in the household, so Hamdan is grateful for the money she saves on vegetables. ""It saves a lot of money and it's great to practice being a farmer,"" said Hamdan. ""It makes me happy working inside our greenhouse. ""We grow tomatoes, cucumbers, green beans, aubergines and zucchini. My neighbors often come round asking if we have any to spare, which makes me very popular. ""And it tastes so much better because there are no chemicals."" The rooftop greenhouse project was launched in April by Karama, an NGO based in Deheishe that works with women and children. Deheishe, established in 1949 on 0.3 square kilometers, is home to 13,000 people, a third of whom are unemployed, according to the United Nations Reliefs and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees. Luay Abdul Ghafar, the greenhouse project manager, said: ""We have no green spaces and a bad economic situation. Most people are from families with a farming background who no longer have contact with the land. ""The idea of the project is to help people in their economic life and at the same time renew their contact with the land."" He said the first season had been a success, with most families growing enough vegetables to feed themselves with some leftover for neighbors. Ghafar said goods imported to the West Bank go through Israel and are sold at Israeli prices, which means fruit and vegetables are expensive for most Palestinians, who have much lower incomes. He estimated that many save a quarter of their overall monthly budget by growing their own fruit and vegetables. The first greenhouses were paid for through a donation made by a Palestinian American woman. A further set paid for by the United Nations have been erected in nearby Aida refugee camp. Now Karama is talking to larger NGOs about expanding the project further afield. ""We are going to have 65 greenhouses soon ... we would like to keep giving them to as many families as we can,"" said Ghafar. At least 18% of West Bank residents live below the poverty line, according to the CIA World Factbook. He said the scheme was administered by women, to help them achieve a better status in their families and communities. Families were chosen to take part according to their need, having enough sun on their roofs and being willing and keen on agriculture, said Ghafar. ""We are thinking about making a collective association so people can sell the vegetables they have leftover at a cheap price to benefit other people as well,"" he added. Ghafar said some people were initially skeptical about the greenhouses because some had previously tried to grow vegetables directly on their roofs, but the soil had destroyed their homes. ""Our challenge was to convince people to understand the greenhouses and that the soil wouldn't be directly on their roofs,"" he said. Hamdan said she was one of those initially skeptical, but had no doubts once she saw the difference it made to her life. ""In the beginning I didn't think it would work,"" she said. ""But once I tried it I saw it was a good idea and would encourage anyone to have a greenhouse.""","Palestinians have farming history but no land to grow produce, says NGO .

"If the Curiosity rover had been sent to Mars in ancient times, it might have found itself sinking in a stream. The 2,000-pound super-rover, which made its now-legendary landing on Mars on August 6, has come across stones in conglomerate rock suggesting that water must have flowed there in the past. One such rock outcrop is called Hottah, after Hottah Lake in Canada's Northwest Territories. It looks like someone took a jackhammer and lifted up a sidewalk, said John Grotzinger, lead scientist for the Curiosity mission, at a press conference Thursday. The consensus is that ""this is a rock that was formed in the presence of water,"" Grotzinger said. ""We can characterize that water as being a vigorous flow."" In and around this bedrock, Curiosity has come across rounded gravels. The rocks appear to have been subjected to a sediment transport process, carried by either water or wind, said scientist Rebecca Williams of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona. The gravels seem too large to have been transported by wind, meaning it's likely that this is a stream bed. A second rock outcrop, called Link, holds similar evidence. Scientists used data from Curiosity and the orbiters at Mars to enhance their understanding of the area. The water flowing in these rock formations was probably somewhere between ankle and hip deep, said Curiosity science co-investigator William Dietrich of the University of California, Berkeley. What we've done on Mars, and what's next . Scientists believe the water and sediment flowed down the crater into an alluvial fan -- a geological formation created by material that water transports. At least intermittently, this fan appears to have extended down to the area where the rover landed. It's hard to say how long ago this water flowed -- an estimate would be ""thousands to millions of years,"" Dietrich said. Previously, scientists have used data from past Mars missions to speculate about channels on the planet, and whether water could have flowed in them. This is the first direct observation of streambed material, Dietrich said. There are no plate tectonics on Mars, meaning the planet does not have moving plates underneath the surface that cause quakes. So why does this Hottah rock formation look the way it does? Grotzinger hypothesizes that ""Somewhere near this outcrop, a small impact occurred and lifted the beds up and rotated them,"" he said. Read more about space and science on CNN's Light Years . The rover did not employ any of its chemistry tools to examine the area; rather, scientists made their judgments about the rocks based on photos. Curiosity is now three-quarters of the way between Hottah and Glenelg, its next official stop. Glenelg was chosen as a target because it has three types of terrain, including layered bedrock, making it a potentially interesting place for Curiosity to try out its drill. An unsolved mystery is whether life could have been supported on Mars. Water is a necessary ingredient, but an energy source and carbon are also essential. Curiosity can detect organic molecules and tear them apart to deliver details about them back to Earth, but they would still not be definitive evidence that life existed. Such molecules can come from nonliving sources, and Curiosity doesn't have the technology to make that distinction. That will have to wait for another mission. This rover's ultimate destination is Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mountain with layers of sediment that will provide more opportunities to search for organic molecules. Curiosity recently tested out its contact instruments on a rock called Jake Matijevic. It used its Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) instrument to touch the rock, and the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) to take close-up photos. Another instrument, ChemCam, shot laser pulses at the rock and finished its testing on Monday. The $2.6 billion mission is slated to last for two years, but previous rovers have far outlasted their estimated lifetimes. The Spirit rover operated from 2004 to 2010, and the Opportunity rover has been chugging along since 2004. These twin rovers had initial mission periods of only 90 days.

"An autopsy report, made public six months after Miriam Carey was shot dead after leading Washington police on a car chase from the White House to the Capitol, revealed that the 34-year-old woman was struck by five bullets from behind. Attorney Eric Sanders, who is representing members of Carey's family in a wrongful death lawsuit against the government, said the autopsy proves the shooting was unjustified. Lt. Kimberly Schneider, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Capitol Police, one of the agencies involved in the incident, said the department would not comment on the pending litigation and while an investigation is ongoing. Schneider said the officers involved are on administrative leave. Sanders released the report on the six-month anniversary of the shooting, which captured national attention as the chase unfolded on cable networks and in the following hours when it was revealed the suspect was an unarmed dental hygienist from Connecticut with a 1-year-old in the backseat. Chase began at the White House . On October 3, Carey approached a White House checkpoint and was approached by Secret Service officers. She made a three-point turn, striking an officer who was trying to move a barricade into her path, before driving away, according to an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant. Police said the car sped down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol, where security vehicles stopped it at Garfield Circle. Carey put the car in reverse, hit a police car and drove away as officers fired at her. Dramatic video footage by a videographer for Alhurra TV, a Middle Eastern news outlet financed by the U.S. government, showed the black vehicle then speeding around a nearby traffic circle with a police car in close pursuit and then heading away. The car crashed into more security barriers a few blocks later, witnesses said. More shots were fired after the vehicle stopped, and the woman was hit several times, said Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier. The child was unharmed. One shot hit her in the head . The office of the District of Columbia medical examiner said in the autopsy that one round struck Carey in the left side of the back of her head, and she was also hit three times in the back and once in her left arm. The report didn't determine in what sequence Carey was hit. Toxicology tests determined Carey didn't have alcohol or drugs in her blood. Her family has questioned since the day of the incident whether shooting Carey was the only way to end the chase, which went through the heart of the nation's capital. Sanders said on Tuesday that Carey's family members still feel police should have considered other options. The autopsy only ""confirms what we said. It was unjustified."" The family is suing the Department of Justice, the Secret Service and U.S. Capitol Police for $75 million. The lawsuit says Carey was unfamiliar with the area and mistakenly drove past the first guard post. When she tried to make a U-turn and drive away, a uniformed Secret Service officer threw a bicycle rack at her car, the lawsuit claims. Carey panicked when she was stopped near the traffic circle and surrounded by officers with their weapons drawn, the suit alleges. The family contends in the document there was no legal justification for officers to shoot her and doing so went against their training. Carey had passport, foreign currency in her car . Police likely feared terrorism . Law enforcement analysts said in the days after the shooting that officers were right to shoot. ""You don't know if she has a bomb,"" CNN's Mike Brooks said in October. ""You don't know if it's a terrorist attack. The officers just don't know."" He dismissed suggestions that police could have defused the situation simply by shooting out the car's tires. ""If you are using deadly force, you are there to try to incapacitate the driver of that car -- of that weapon,"" he said. ""If they did shoot the tires out, the car can keep moving."" Maki Haberfeld, chairwoman of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, added that police would have had no way of knowing whether Carey posed a threat as she got out of the car, and therefore the shooting was justified. ""We live in times of heightened alert as far as terrorist activities are concerned,"" she said. ""The fact that she was not displaying a gun doesn't mean anything, because bombers don't necessarily display anything. They have the explosives around their waist, usually. ""It's a matter of a split-second decision that the police officer needs to take before someone explodes himself. It's all about the larger context. They just push the button, or it could be activated from a remote location."" Sister: Carey diagnosed with postpartum depression . There were also questions about Carey's mental state. A few months after her daughter was born, Miriam Carey was diagnosed with postpartum depression with psychosis, her sister told CNN's ""AC360"" in October. Postpartum psychosis can cause delusions and paranoia, according to medical experts. ""There wasn't a pattern. It was something that occurred suddenly,"" Amy Carey-Jones said. ""She seemed overwhelmed. There was a lot of stress. ""There were not moments of her walking around with delusions. That was not what was going on."" She said her sister had been making progress with the help of counseling and medications. Carey-Jones said her sister relayed to her that doctors told her she didn't need the medication anymore. ""They tapered her off the medications, and she said she felt fine,"" Carey-Jones said. She declined to discuss what medication Miriam Carey had taken. 'My sister didn't deserve this'","In October, Miriam Carey was chased by authorities after an incident at a White House gate .

"Responsibilities come along with a camera: when to use it or when to set it aside. Our human nature is to gawk, and the camera often creates a layer of added unreality, shielding at least our full attention from all that is in front of us. A freelance photographer for The New York Post recently took a heart-stopping photo of a subway train bearing down on a man who had fallen on the tracks. Instead of trying to pull the man to safety, the photographer took photos. One landed on the cover the The Post. The public outcry -- against the photographer, the paper and the bystanders who also did nothing to save the man -- was swift and severe. Back in the day when mobile phones did not come with a built-in camera, uproars made us duck and cringe. You'd suck in your breath and hope that trouble might sweep by without touching. Nowadays, if you are an ordinary citizen or even a special officer who is off duty, I hope you will find a quick, compassionate, humane response to everything in life. My purpose here is not to address the issue of journalists who are merely on duty, looking for spot news or prowling for features. My argument is not about instinct and reflex, which probably gripped the subway photographer, R. Umar Abbasi. He told reporters he ""had no idea"" what he was shooting. ""I'm not even sure it was registering with me what was happening. I just started running. I had my camera up -- it wasn't even set to the right settings -- and I just kept shooting and flashing, hoping the train driver would see something and be able to stop."" Opinion: Why the outrage over photo in subway death? Whatever Abbasi's motives may have been or still be, it is the habit of many photojournalists to shoot a lot and to keep shooting at all costs, especially in the heat of a dramatic moment.  It's the reality of the job. In the movies, every photojournalist starts off as an aloof, confused, emotionally stunted voyeur. Think of Jimmy Stewart in ""Rear Window,"" Dennis Hopper in ""Apocalypse Now"" or the photographers portrayed in ""Blood Diamond,"" ""Delirious"" and ""City of God."" Screenwriters always demand that they lay their cameras down and, only in that way, attain clarity, take action and remake events for the sake of a noble, happy ending. Bearing witness is never enough, in this characterization. It's a popular conclusion, seemingly the only one that we are fed, but it is not in the best interests of society.  Indeed, the National Press Photographers Association feels so conflicted about our role that it now goes beyond giving out awards simply for the best pictures of the year. It now has another plaque for the photojournalist who stops taking pictures, choosing instead to save a stranger's life or limb. I've been an investigative journalist and photographer for over 40 years, half of that in the field and half of it on the assignment desk. I am frequently called upon to judge the work of my peers. The journalist's job is to be invisible and, in that way, to see on behalf of everyone else. We perform our most vital role when the stakes are high, even to the level of life and death. Our duty is to test the tough question, the one at the very heart of a given story, the one immediately at hand. Say a photojournalist and an editor want to do a story about medicine and public policy. They might reflect on a couple of these questions and attempt to show them in a journalistic investigation: How often do schizophrenic patients stop taking their meds, becoming a danger to themselves and others? Does trouble sometimes show up like clockwork and for the same combination of reasons? Might a schizophrenic patient with a history of violence pick fights and hurt people? Is it time for an intervention? Nothing could be more compelling for the public and policymakers to examine, and photographs could be the best way to illuminate the problem. If the system needs fixing and our role as journalists is to witness things when they break down, we can't go around preventing or fixing the breakdowns before they even happen. We have to simply watch and wait and see how bad things get. We must see for ourselves. Stories of this quality are not psychologically easy for the journalist to undertake, or for the public to digest.  They must be presented in a dignified manner, with the fullest possible context.  If editors try to be quick and lurid in their display, both subjects and audience will only feel insulted. Back in 1977, in Rhodesia, I watched the brutal interrogation and torture of a man over a three-day period. The officer in charge later learned that the prisoner had died as a result. Up until that point, the government and the army had insisted that there was nothing to the rumors of such treatment, that if there were problems, they weren't significant. Only by waiting and watching patiently, I found out that there was more to the story. Much more. In 2005, I sat on a panel at Columbia University that reviewed the best journalism of the year. One unforgettable news photograph -- out of a portfolio of 20 -- showed Iraqi insurgents pulling a man out of a car in midday traffic and shooting him in the head. When we awarded that eyewitness account with a Pulitzer Prize, a chorus of criticism was heaped on the decision. The photo was too disturbing, so they said. How did the photographer just happen to be there? Couldn't he have stopped it? Wasn't he just as bad as the bad guys? No. He was doing his job. He was performing one of the most crushing duties that society can assign, all in the name of today's honesty, tomorrow's decisions about it and history's fullest account. Entering this profession is not easy, and not everyone has the internal strength for it. But we dare not turn a blind eye. Someone's got to do it.","Photographer took picture of man in path of subway; public outcry ensued .

"(CNN)Everybody knows Southern California has a water problem. Andy Lipkis thinks he can help fix it. Lipkis, the founder of the California-based conservation group TreePeople, isn't planning to seed clouds or change Pacific weather patterns. He has a simpler solution: conservation combined with a little old-fashioned technology, like rain barrels, trees and permeable surfaces. ""People think we're crazy when I say we're working on building a new water supply that produces as much as half of L.A.'s water from local rainfall. They say, 'that's great, but it doesn't rain here,' "" he said. But even during 2013, one of the driest years in Los Angeles history, it rained 3.6 inches -- and that meant billions of gallons were washed away and wasted, he says. Lipkis' organization estimates that the city lost 28 billion gallons of water that year, or 6,500 gallons per L.A. resident. According to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the average single-family residential unit uses about 387 gallons per day, or about 130 per person. So that was about seven weeks' worth, gone. And that was a dry year. (Despite recent rains, 2014 was also fairly dry.) In an average year, Los Angeles receives close to 15 inches. What if more of that water could be harvested instead of washed out to the Pacific? Along with other organizations, including city and state entities, TreePeople is trying to do just that. Lipkis, who is fond of holding up a glass of water and announcing that he's drinking ""dinosaur pee,"" likes to emphasize that water resources are finite and that nature is water's best recycler. Several groups have combined on a project that captures rainwater in gutters and lets the overflow get sifted through permeable surfaces, allowing nature to cleanse the runoff. For the Sun Valley Watershed, a part of the San Fernando Valley that routinely floods, the groups retrofitted parts of the area with collection devices, trees and landscaping. For one project, Elmer Avenue, the result was enough water saved yearly to supply 30 households. The city, through its LA Stormwater agency and other departments, is now expanding such initiatives. And along the way it's become an unlikely model for conservation; Los Angeles now uses less water than it did in 1970, despite a surge in population. Other municipalities are following suit. Nearby Orange County has installed a Groundwater Replenishment System that relies on reverse osmosis and microfiltration. In parched Wichita Falls, Texas, authorities have turned to recycling wastewater. Even Seattle -- not known for its dryness -- has adopted a number of conservation practices, says Lipkis. Education and implementation are still a work in progress, he says. There are political and financial considerations at work, he observes, and getting everybody on the same page is a formidable challenge in its own right. But Lipkis believes the payoff is huge, including jobs to create the infrastructure and more long-term water for everyone. ""In the big picture, the state, the regional water boards, the county -- everybody is saying we need multiple approaches to solve the problem,"" he said. ""(But) the change is well under way. A lot of the fundamentals have been put in place."" And that's as refreshing as a tall glass of ... you know.","Los Angeles has become an unlikely model for water conservation .

"(CNN)A decades-old mystery that captivated Oklahoma has been solved after officials confirmed the identities of two groups of people -- some of them teens -- who went missing in 1969 and 1970. The first crack in the cold cases came when police in the tiny town of Sayre were testing sonar equipment in September 2013 in murky Foss Lake. They were stunned to discover a green 1952 Chevrolet and a blue 1969 Chevrolet Camaro. Human remains found in the Camaro matched the general descriptions of three teenagers -- Jimmy Allen Williams, 16, Leah Gail Johnson, 18, and Thomas Michael Rios, 18, all from Sayre, the state Medical Examiner's Office said. The other remains matched the genders and ages of three passengers in the green Chevrolet who went missing in 1969, the medical examiner said last year. John Alva Porter, then 69, was in that car with Cleburn Hammack, 42, and Nora Marie Duncan, 58. DNA test results this week prove that the bodies belonged to the missing, the state Medical Examiner's Office said, adding that they all died from drowning and their deaths were accidental. One night in 1970, another in 1969 . The three teenagers who disappeared went for a ride around their hometown in Williams' blue Camaro with a white top, according to the Doe Network, a volunteer organization that helps law enforcement solve cold cases. Only six days before the 16-year-old and his friends went missing, Williams had bought the used Camaro, a slick muscle car that teenage boys loved at that time, said Dayva Spitzer, publisher of The Sayre Record & Beckham County Democrat newspaper. Johnson was Native American and, Spitzer said, was related to legendary Indian chief Sitting Bull. Residents regarded Johnson as an Indian princess, she told CNN. Williams and his friends had planned to attend a football game the night they went missing, but they may have gone hunting instead, Spitzer said. Two rifles were found, rusted and corroded, in the Camaro. In the other car, Porter, Duncan and Hammack were last seen when their car was ""given a push"" to help get it started, according to a July 1969 newspaper article published in Oklahoma. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Michael Martinez and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","Human remains found in 2013 were tested for DNA .

"Asuogyaman, Ghana (CNN) -- Patricia Mawuli grew up in a mud shack in Ghana's bush country. As a young girl, she would wistfully watch the planes pass overhead, wishing one day to fly one herself. In 2007, at the age of 21, she decided to break into the boy's club that is Ghana's flight industry. She walked to Kpong Airfield and asked for job. ""I (told) her no, we don't employ women,"" recalls Jonathan Porter, the airfield's technical director. ""The whole concept of employing women in an environment where you're clearing trees and building airplanes didn't seem to me, in my experience, to fit in with the African context,"" he admits. Mawuli was persistent, however, and when she offered her services for free, he couldn't resist giving her a trial. He gave her a machete and told her to clear tree trunks. To his surprise, she flourished. ""She used her head, not just her muscles,"" he recalls. ""She thought about how she did things and took out the trees better than the men."" Not only did Porter give her the job, he taught her how to fly, and in 2009 she became the country's first female civilian pilot (as well as the first woman in West Africa certified to build and maintain Rotax engines). ""I said: 'I will do whatever it takes, I'll work hard, you don't have to pay me.' They told me: 'Don't worry. You are so different. You've got energy, you have potential. We will do whatever it takes.' This is when my whole flying career just started to boom,"" recalls Mawuli. Since then, Mawuli has been offered jobs from all over the world, but she's decided to stay put and help grow a generation of female pilots in Ghana. With Porter, she has launched an academy called AV-Tech, which aims to provide young Ghanaian girls with the skills, training and inspiration they need to make it on their own as pilots. ""There are a lot of young people (who), when they see me, (are given) hope. It motivates them to learn harder because they believe women actually have something ahead of them,"" she says. Some, like Catherine Shelton, have come from as far afield as the United States to learn from Mawuli. ""She's a very good instructor,"" says Shelton. ""She's taught me general airfield operations -- safety, security -- (and) a lot culturally. She's taught me the difference in the aviation industry here versus the U.S. versus Europe. ""And she keeps me smiling.""","Patricia Mawuli is Ghana's first female civilian pilot .

"Washington (CNN)Edward Brooke -- the first African-American to be popularly elected to the U.S. Senate -- passed away Saturday, according to family spokesman Ralph Neas and the Massachusetts Republican Party. Brooke was 95. Brooke served in the Senate from 1967-1979 and has often been heralded by both parties as a trailblazer. He is the only African-American to be elected to a second term and was the first black Republican elected to the Senate since Reconstruction. President Barack Obama hailed Brooke as someone who led ""an extraordinary life of public service."" ""As the first African-American elected as a state's Attorney General and first African-American U.S. Senator elected after reconstruction, Ed Brooke stood at the forefront of the battle for civil rights and economic fairness. During his time in elected office, he sought to build consensus and understanding across partisan lines, always working towards practical solutions to our nation's challenges,"" the President said in a statement Saturday night. Brooke grew up in a racially divided Washington, D.C. and after graduating college he served in the Army during World War II later receiving a Bronze Star. After his military service, he moved to Massachusetts and attended law school. Later he would enter politics -- first winning the position of Massachusetts attorney general in 1962. Four years later he ran for the Senate and won. ""Massachusetts has a history of sending giants to the United States Senate, great statesmen like Quincy Adams, Webster, Cabot Lodge, and Kennedy. We count Ed Brooke among them.  He carried the added honor and burden of being 'the first' and did so with distinction and grace.  I have lost a friend and mentor.  America has lost a superb example of selfless service.  Diane and I extend our deepest condolences to the Brooke family,"" Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, said in a statement Saturday. Leaders of both parties Saturday honored Brooke honoring his career and praising his lasting legacy. ""He was never partisan or wedded to party interests,"" civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Georgia)  recounted. ""He was a champion for whatever he believed was right.  He was instrumental in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and added an important open-housing requirement to the act.  He also crafted the Brooke Amendment a year later which capped the financial responsibility of public housing applicants to no more than 25 percent of a poor person's income."" ""America mourns the loss of a trailblazer who will always be remembered as a model of courage and honesty in office: Senator Edward W. Brooke. Senator Brooke's accomplishments remind us that anything is possible in our country. It's a proud legacy that paved the way for others. And it's a proud legacy that will live on into history,"" incoming Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. ""Massachusetts has a history of sending giants to the United States Senate, great statesmen like Quincy Adams, Webster, Cabot Lodge, and Kennedy. We count Ed Brooke among them. He carried the added honor and burden of being 'the first' and did so with distinction and grace. I have lost a friend and mentor. America has lost a superb example of selfless service."" Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, said in a statement Saturday. While in the Senate he played a key part in the passage of civil rights and low-income housing bills earning him the title ""Mr. Housing."" ""A decorated war hero, this Massachusetts Republican was a highly respected legislator responsible for shaping our nation's laws and ensuring equal rights for all men and women. The Massachusetts Republican Party is proud to have had Senator Brooke as one of our party's leaders,"" Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Kirsten Hughes said Saturday. He took some liberal positions while he served his two terms in the Senate and at times opposed three of President Richard Nixon's Supreme Court nominees. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, the only black Republican serving in the Senate, said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the news Saturday, on his Twitter account. ""Deeply saddened by the loss of Senator Edward Brooke. He was a true trailblazer; those of us who followed cannot thank him enough,"" Scott tweeted. The popular Brooke faced some controversy at the end of his Senate tenure after a probe of his personal finances following a divorce. ""It was just a divorce case,"" he told the Boston Globe in a 2000 interview. ""It was never about my work in the Senate. There was never a charge that I committed a crime, or even nearly committed a crime."" Brooke passed away early Saturday morning at his home in Florida of natural causes according to Neas.","Former Massachusetts Republican Sen. Edward Brooke died Saturday at the age of 95 .

"Six tanks at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in southeast Washington state are leaking radioactive waste, the governor said Friday, calling the news ""disturbing"" even as he insisted there are ""no immediate health risks."" ""News of six leaking tanks at Hanford raises serious questions about integrity of all single tanks,"" Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday afternoon on Twitter. Inslee said that he got the latest information about the site during a meeting in Washington with U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu. One week earlier, Chu called the governor to tell him that a single-shell tank in the same location was leaking liquids at a rate of 150 to 300 gallons per year. Believed to be the first to lose liquids since 2005, that tank was built in the 1940s and can hold roughly 447,000 gallons of sludge, according to the governor's office. ""(Chu) told me today that his department did not adequately analyze data it had that would have shown the other tanks that are leaking,"" Inslee said. The sprawling, 586-square mile Hanford site houses a total of 177 underground tanks full of radioactive sludge, of which 149 are single-shell tanks. On Friday, Inslee said there is ""still no current health risk"" tied to the leaks. He made similar comments a week earlier, saying ""it would be quite some time before these leaks could breach groundwater or the Columbia River."" At the same time, the governor stressed that the problem must be addressed. ""This certainly raises serious questions about the integrity of all 149 single-shell tanks with radioactive liquid and sludge at Hanford,"" he said Friday. Hard lessons for U.S. nuclear safety from Fukushima meltdown . Hanford became a focal point of U.S. nuclear efforts beginning in 1943, when aspects of the Manhattan Project were moved there. As local residents moved out, thousands of workers moved into the site where plutonium for use in atomic bombs was produced. Two bombs were dropped on Japan during the final days of World War II. The site -- about half the size of Rhode Island, in an area centered roughly 75 miles east of Yakima -- continued to buzz during the Cold War, with more plutonium production as well as the construction of several nuclear reactors. The last reactor shut down in 1987, though a mammoth cleanup effort remained to address what state and federal authorities deemed the most contaminated site in the Western Hemisphere. Those efforts were bolstered by about $2 billion in federal stimulus funds authorized in several years ago. But decades of more work remain, which is why Washington's governor said he feared that across-the-board budget cuts called the sequester -- which could take effect March 1, unless Congress passes and President Barack Obama signs an alternative -- could negatively affect activity at the site. ""We need to be sure the federal government maintains its commitment and legal obligation to the cleanup of Hanford,"" Inslee said. ""To see Hanford workers furloughed at the exact moment we have additional leakers out there is completely unacceptable.""","Last week, Washington's governor said 1 tank at the Hanford nuclear site was leaking .

"It's been a little over a year since President Barack Obama accused the Syrian government of crossing a ""red line,"" with the use of poison gas against civilians. This week, the last of the country's declared chemical weapons stockpiles are sailing to their eventual demise. On Wednesday,  600 metric tons of Syrian chemicals weapons were transferred from a Danish ship to the U.S. government container ship, the Cape Ray,  at an Italian port, Gioia Tauro. The Cape Ray is now set to sail into international waters, where the on-board process of neutralizing the chemicals will be carried out,  according to the OPCW, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which led the mission to remove and destroy the weapons . It will take 60 days to neutralize the chemicals safely and cleanly, the Pentagon said. The rest of the chemicals will be destroyed at plants in the United States and Europe, but no active weapons grade materials will enter either of those places. By the time they arrive, they will be broken down to industrial chemicals. The resulting hazardous waste will be further processed in Germany and Finland. The chemical weapons left Syria on the Danish ship Ark Futura just over a week ago, bound for Italy. A breakthrough . It was a major milestone when the weapons left the Syrian port of Latakia, said Ahmet Uzumcu, the chief of the OPCW. ""Never before has an entire arsenal of a category of weapons of mass destruction been removed from a country experiencing a state of internal armed conflict,"" he said. But inspectors can't say for sure that some undeclared weapons aren't still lurking somewhere in the country. Syria's civil war has dragged on since 2011, and in 2013 images surfaced of civilians who allegedly died from poison gas attacks. The nonpartisan Doctors Without Borders then reported that three hospitals near Damascus treated more than 3,000 patients suffering ""neurotoxic symptoms."" The United Nations firmed up the accusations after sending inspectors into the country. Violence continues . The White House has stepped up U.S. military support to rebels fighting the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, though it stopped short of putting weapons in their hands. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution requiring Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons arsenal, and al-Assad promised to adhere to the resolution. The following month, Syria began dismantling its chemical weapons program. The OPCW reported that Syrians were using torches and grinders to destroy or disable weapons such as missile warheads and aerial bombs. Despite the apparent end to a chapter in the history of Syria's chemical weapons, on the ground in Syria, trauma and bloodshed continue. U.S.: Signs point to Syria using chlorine gas in attacks .","600 metric tons of chemicals weapons are on a U.S. ship,  officials say .
