"Spain has been accused of ‘absurdity and hypocrisy’ after allowing three Russian navy ships to dock in its territories in north Africa. British MPs said Madrid’s decision to allow the vessels - including a heavily-armed destroyer - to take on fuel, food and other supplies offered ‘succour’ to Moscow. Incredibly, the vessels docked in Ceuta as tensions between Nato - of which Spain is a member - and Russia mounted over the crisis in Ukraine. Russia's destroyer Vice Admiral Kulakov (pictured) and two other vessels were allowed to dock in Spanish territory . It also highlighted Spanish double-standards over controlling territory in Morocco while sabre-rattling about British sovereignty over Gibraltar, a UK territory since 1713. Last night WED Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, a member of Parliament’s all-party group on Gibraltar, said: ‘How is the defence alliance supposed to work if members of Nato behave like this? ‘It is completely perverse and highlights the absurdity and short-sightedness of Spain’s position. We are supposed to be allies. ‘It is also blatantly hypocritical to allow Russian warships to use a territory which is not part of mainland Spain while complaining to the UK about us having Gibraltar. ‘Spain is going to achieve nothing by pursuing these shoddy and nonsensical policies.’ Spain has held Ceuta and Melilla, two ports of almost 100,000 people each and islands on the north African coast, for around 500 years ago. Two weeks ago, three Russian navy ships - the 6,900-tonne destroyer Vice Admiral Kulakov and tankers Duban and Sergey Osipov - docked at Ceuta, less than 50miles across the Mediterranean from Gibraltar. The vessels docked in Ceuta as tensions between Nato and Russia mounted over the crisis in Ukraine . The warship, which carries 350 troops, took on board 740 tons of diesel and 100 tons of water. Russian Navy ships have visited Ceuta six times since the beginning of the year. The El Pueblo De Ceuta newspaper reported ‘Together with the welcome and good treatment of its [Russian] personnel the visits have benefitted the city’s businesses.’ The latest visit raised eyebrows as diplomatic relations between the West and Moscow have cooled over the crisis engulfing Ukraine. It is completely perverse and highlights the absurdity and short-sightedness of Spain's position. We are supposed to be allies . - Andrew Rosindell MP . Armed pro-Kremlin separatists have taken over towns and cities in eastern Ukraine in protest at the toppling of Moscow-aligned president Viktor Yanukovych in February. It prompted Russia to annexe Crimea and send troops across the border into its former Soviet neighbour - a move condemned by the West. Nato has responded by increasing its military presence in the Baltics, to send a message to Vladimir Putin not to try and stir up unrest in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Three weeks ago, the Royal Navy sent Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon to track the Vice Admiral Kulakov as it approached British waters. In an echo of the Cold War, it scrambled to escort the vessel past the waters off Scotland. Even though the Russian ship did not enter UK territorial waters, the Portsmouth-based HMS Dragon is kept at high-readiness to respond to such events. Nato, including Spain and Britain, had formed a defence alliance against Russia as the Ukraine conflict continues . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the deployment of HMS Dragon was ‘pre-planned’ after the Navy was notified of the Russian’s route. Some military experts believe Russia is testing out UK defences. Davis Lewin, political director of the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, urged Nato to raise the issue of Russian naval vessels docking in Ceuta with Madrid. He said: ‘Nato has always sought cooperation with a responsible Russia to further post-Cold War stability in Europe and wider afield. ‘Given Vladimir Putin’s illegal aggression against the people of the Ukraine however, this cooperation must be subject to review. This should include arrangements between member countries and Russia such as Russian Warships docking in Ceuta. ‘NATO is designed to protect us from exactly this menace. Its posture at this time should sharply remind Mr Putin about the costs of aggression against democratic neighbours.’ The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Madrid did not respond to calls last night.","Three vessels docked in Ceuta, south of Spain, despite tensions .

"The BBC has revealed a record number of viewers now watch its programmes on the internet, fuelling fears thousands of households are legally dodging the licence fee. New figures show the corporation’s iPlayer website received 242million hits last month, up 38 per cent on last year. More than two million watched Top Gear online, while many others used the internet to stream sporting events, such as the Wimbledon tennis final. The BBC said its iPlayer website received 242million hits last month - up 38 per cent on last year . It is thought many viewers who use the iPlayer service do not own televisions, meaning they are not required to pay the £145.50 annual licence fee. A TV licence is required for viewing programmes online only when they are broadcast in their scheduled slots or streamed live, as in the case of Wimbledon. Although the BBC has so far refused calls to reveal how many households dodge the fee by using this online loophole, the statistics suggest the corporation’s funding model has become increasingly outmoded in the digital age. Almost all the BBC’s programmes are available on the internet catch-up service and can be viewed just a few minutes after finishing on television. Some programmes, such as a forthcoming Peter Kay sitcom, are even being made available on iPlayer first. It is thought many iPlayer users do not own TVs meaning they legally avoid the £145.50 annual licence fee . The idea is likely to be extended . after the BBC approved a 12-month trial which would allow up to 40 hours . of programming to be shown online before transmission on TV. It means licence fee payers without internet access are funding programmes they cannot watch.The figures were released as Hollywood . actor Kevin Spacey predicted that traditional TV channels will be killed . off in the next ten to 20 years as viewers turn to the internet to . watch their favourite shows. He said viewers of the future will choose . to ‘binge’ for days on end as entire series are made available online, . rather than commit to weeks of viewing as each episode is broadcast on . TV. Kevin Spacey predicted traditional TV channels will be killed off in the next ten to 20 years . Spacey, 54, said the success of his online-only series House of Cards was proof of the shift in viewing habits. He starred in and produced the political drama, which has been watched by more than 1.5million Britons this year via online distributor Netflix. Giving the annual MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh Television Festival last night, Spacey said viewers now want the freedom to watch what they want, whenever they want. ‘Clearly the success of the Netflix model – releasing the entire season  of House of Cards at once – has  proved one thing: The audience wants the control. They want freedom,’  he said. ‘If they want to binge – as they’ve been doing on House of Cards – then we should let them binge. Many people have stopped me on the street to say, “Thanks, you sucked three days out of my life”.’ The Oscar winner, who has starred in a string of successful films, became the artistic director of London’s Old Vic theatre in 2003. But instead of defending traditional mediums, he said film and TV would be completely replaced by online shows ‘in the next decade or two’. He said: ‘For kids growing up now there’s no difference watching Avatar on an iPad or watching YouTube on a TV and watching Game of Thrones on their computer. It’s all content. It’s all story.’ He added: ‘We all still crave shared experiences. But these days the water cooler moment where people gathered at work to talk about what they’d seen on TV the night before, has vanished. We no longer live in a world of appointment viewing.’","iPlayer received 242million hits last month - up 38 per cent on last year .

"Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli was taken off in a behind closed doors friendly with Wolves after a heated conversation with referee Chris Foy. The 24-year-old, who moved to Anfield from AC Milan in a £16million deal last month, appeared to be held back by Kolo Toure as Foy attempted to talk to him during the game at Melwood. Sportsmail understands the Italian was involved in a robust 50-50 challenge with a Wolves player. No altercation took place and Balotelli was substituted soon after.

Toure put his arm around his former Manchester City team-mate as Foy spoke to him about the incident. Balotelli was later pictured leaving the training ground. The ex-Inter Milan star had started the game with the likes of Adam Lallana, Jose Enrique and Lucas. The hosts ran out 1-0 winners against the Championship side, with Lallana scoring the goal. Balotelli made his debut for Brendan Rodgers' side in last Sunday's 3-0 win against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. He failed to score but impressed with his  movement in the box as the Reds returned to winning ways after a 3-1 defeat at Manchester City.

"A man in his late forties plunged to his death in front of horrified families at a packed Tate Modern yesterday after falling more than 100ft from a private members’ balcony. The visitor to the London art gallery fell from the terrace of a bar and restaurant area, as tourists picnicking by the Thames in the late afternoon sun watched in shock. Witnesses claimed the man, who was dressed in a suit and in his late forties, had jumped from the railings five floors above. Shocking: Mr Foreman plummeted to the ground from the London art gallery's private members' terrace five floors up . The exclusive ‘Members’ Room’ terrace is available only to members of the museum, who pay £60 a year to have access to private viewings of new exhibitions. It is a busy period for the gallery, with shows by hugely popular artists Damien Hirst and Edvard Munch taking place. Elodie Soetaert, 25, an account manager for We Are Social, said: 'We arrived just after and saw police and police tape everywhere. The body was covered in tarpaulin and the police had put screens up so we couldn’t see it. 'It was really shocking. Some people had been playing music and when they stopped it was silent. Bystanders: Day-trippers packing the area around the Thames were aghast at the incident . 'I’d gone for drinks with my friends and I’m happy I arrived after he had fallen because I wouldn’t have wanted to see that.' Another witness said the man was wearing a suit without a tie and had the top buttons of his shirt undone. He said: 'We heard a thud and people ran over and were standing around him. One man was sick. It was ages before an ambulance arrived.' One Tate employee, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was just finishing my shift when I heard what had happened. 'As I was walking out of the building I saw him on the ground. 'It was horrible. I didn't stop to look at any more. Everybody is so shocked. Nobody is even speaking about it today.' High season: Major exhibitions of work by Damien Hirst and Edvard Munch were taking place at the London gallery . A cyclist who saw a man plunge to his death returned to the gallery yesterday to leave a bunch of flowers at the spot where he died. The man, who would not give his name, said he did not know the victim, as he laid a bunch of pink lilies outside just after 4pm. Looking visibly upset, he said: 'I was on the balcony of the espresso bar when it happened, which is two floors below where he fell. 'I didn't see or hear anything beforehand I just saw him fall and hit the ground. 'It was awful. It was one of the most shocking things I've ever seen.' An office worker, who was on his way home, said: 'I saw two ambulances and a couple of police cars outside. Drama: Mr Foreman had been reported missing just a day before the tragic incident . 'It was only when I read the news today that I realised what had happened. It's so awful. I wondered if he had worked in the area and asked my colleagues but no one seemed to know anything about it.' Shocked onlookers took to the internet to describe the tragic incident. @CathHannahx wrote on Twitter: ‘Seeing the guy who had committed suicide and jumped off the Tate modern has been the most traumatic thing I have seen.’ Some onlookers at first thought it was 'a staged flash mob thing' and took photographs, tweeted @salmasaid. Another user, @afbsutherland, said: 'Weird day at Tate modern. Sehgal was amazing, the possible suicide outside was pretty awful. Hope it wasn't as bad as it looked.' A spokesman for the museum confirmed that a man fell to the ground from a balcony of the museum and said that police were investigating. She added: ‘An ambulance was called immediately but he was pronounced dead. ‘Our deepest sympathies go to his family.’ The Metropolitan Police could not confirm or deny whether the death was a suicide. Sudden death: Police stand guard outside the gallery after the afternoon tragedy . A spokesman said: 'Officers were called out at 5.55pm to the Tate Modern after reports of a man falling from a balcony. 'A man in his late 40s was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.08pm. 'Officers believe they known the identity of the man but await formal confirmation. The family have been informed. 'A post mortem exam is to take place and an inquest will be held. 'The death is being treated as non-suspicious.' This is not the first time the gallery has encountered tragedy. In 2007, lawyer Matthew Courtney, 27, plunged 80ft down a stairwell leading to the art gallery’s seventh floor restaurant in a tragic accident.

"His wife may be behind the nation's biggest healthy-eating campaign, but even the president is allowed one day off a year. President Barack Obama is celebrating Thanksgiving with a quiet family dinner at the White House - where he will be feasting on a choice of nine pies. The first family will have a . choice of huckleberry pie, pecan pie, chocolate cream pie, sweet potato . pie, peach pie, apple pie, pumpkin pie, banana cream pie or coconut cream pie, The Hill reported. The selection offers three more pies than last year. Savory dishes on the menu include turkey, honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing, oyster . stuffing, greens, macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, . green bean casserole and dinner rolls. Scroll down for video . Tucking in: President Obama (pictured in Nevada in 2008) will have a choice of nine pies at Thanksgiving dinner in the White House today. He will also enjoy turkey, ham and macaroni cheese . The gluttonous menu would seem at odds with Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move!' anti-obesity campaign, but she has previously conceded that exceptions can be made on special occasions. Some previous presidents have chosen to spend the holiday at Camp David, the secluded Maryland mountaintop retreat, but the Obamas have chosen to stay at the Executive Mansion. The guest list for the private dinner wasn't made public, so it was not clear who would be helping the president, first lady Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia with all of those pies. Ahead of the dinner, Obama called several members of the armed forces to thank them for their service to the country. Traditions: Obama makes a Thanksgiving Day phone call to a member of the U.S. military stationed overseas, from the Oval Office this morning. He called 10 service members to say thanks . The White House said he talked to 10 service members - two each from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard. The White House said the president wished them and their families 'a happy Thanksgiving'. The White House Thanksgiving menu includes turkey, honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing, oyster . stuffing, greens, macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, . green bean casserole and dinner rolls. For dessert, the family will have a . choice of huckleberry pie, pecan pie, chocolate cream pie, sweet potato . pie, peach pie, apple pie, pumpkin pie, banana cream pie or coconut cream pie, The Hill reported. (The selection offers three more pies than last year.) His White House photographer snapped an image of Obama on the phone in the Oval Office this morning, wearing a casual gray sweater and grinning widely. The family's feast came after a day of Thanksgiving traditions. Obama continued an annual family tradition on Wednesday by helping to pack bags of food and distribute them to the needy on Thanksgiving eve. Obama, Michelle, Malia and Sasha, and his mother-in-law, Marian Robinson, dropped in on the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB), one of the largest serving the Washington area. They placed bundles of sweet potatoes, onions, carrots and apples into reusable bags people held open as they walked by. They also handed out small white boxes stamped with the presidential seal that contain M&M's candy. Obama wished people a 'Happy Thanksgiving' while Malia shook their hands. It's the third straight Thanksgiving that Obama and his family have helped out at this particular food bank. Helping hand: On Wednesday, Obama, Michelle and their daughters Sasha and Malia helped distribute bags of food to needy children and seniors at the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington D.C. Making peace: He also pardoned the 2013 National Thanksgiving Turkey 'Popcorn' with Sasha and Malia . Earlier in the day, Obama spared two turkeys from the brine and the oven. Obama pardoned Popcorn, who shared the stage with the president on the North Portico of the White House on a cold, drizzly day. An alternate turkey, named Caramel, also received a pardon, though it did not have the benefit of a face-to-beak meeting with the president. The turkeys will be on display at George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens through January 6. Presidents have spared turkeys off and on as far back as the Lincoln era, according to the White House. The first official pardon was granted by President George HW Bush.","The Obamas are having a quiet family Thanksgiving at the White House with a traditional menu of turkey, ham, sweet potatoes and greens .

"The chance of couples divorcing in the early years of their marriage is at its lowest since the 1970s, figures reveal. The number who become victims of the ‘seven-year itch’ and end their marriage at that point has dropped by a fifth in the past 15 years alone. The fall in divorce among couples married for a decade or less is largely behind the overall increase in the stability of marriage, the figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest. Happily ever after: The chance of couples divorcing in the early years of their marriage has fallen to its lowest since the 1970s, new marriage breakdown figures have shown . Reasons: Men now mainly marry out of choice - rather than the family pressure which often used to push many into a wedding - and so are much less likely to stray or to neglect their wives, researchers believe . Analysts . say the popularity of living together has meant that men who eventually . decide to marry are much more committed to their wives and families . than their fathers were. They . now mainly marry out of choice – rather than as a result of the family . pressure that pushed many into marriage in the past. This means they . are much less likely to stray or to neglect their wives, researchers . believe. The figures also revealed that divorces are now less likely to be initiated by wives. The . first decade of marriage is the toughest for most couples, with . break-ups most likely in this period. The chances of staying together . rise sharply after the 10th anniversary. However, the latest figures show the divorce rate gradually dropping for couples in those most challenging first years together. The . chance of a couple who married in 2005 divorcing by 2012 is now 14 per . cent, down from  17 per cent for those who wed  in the late 1980s and . much of  the 1990s. Risk: Couples are most likely to break up in the first decade of their marriage, and their chances of staying together rise sharply after the 10th anniversary . The . seven-year-itch break-up rate, which rose fast after the liberalisation . of divorce laws in the early 1970s, was last at 14 per cent between 1978 . and 1981. A couple who . married in 2005 were around a fifth less likely to divorce by 2012 than . those whose weddings were in 1991, the peak year for divorce. However, . the ONS figures do not include marriages that take place abroad – for . example, on holidays – and some analysts calculate that if these were . taken into account, couples are now a quarter less likely to part within . seven years. The number of . wives petitioning for divorce has fallen by more than a third since the . early 1990s, according to the ONS. In 2012, women initiated 76,490 . divorces, down from more than 106,000 as recently as 2003. By contrast, . the number of divorces stemming from petitions by husbands has remained . at between 40,000 and 45,000 a year since 1980. Some . researchers believe the change has happened because women are much less . likely to  find themselves betrayed or abandoned by their husbands. Living together: Analysts say the popularity of cohabitation has meant that men in particular who do finally decide to marry are much more committed to their wives and families than their fathers were . Harry . Benson, of the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘As cohabitation has become . more and more accepted over the past 20 years, family pressure on men to . get married has reduced. ‘Couples . are no longer being told they must do the right  thing. As a result, . the couples who decide to marry are the  most committed.’ He . added: ‘The decision to buy into a marriage is very important for men. Men are more committed to their marriage and wives are happier. You can . see this in the rates at which wives and husbands are petitioning for . divorce. ‘There is a long-term decline in divorces started by wives, while the rate for husbands is absolutely flat.’ ONS . analysts also suggest that the increase in couples living together . before marriage in recent years may be a factor in declining divorce. ‘Cohabitation . is often a precursor to marriage and may act to filter out weaker . relationships from progressing to marriage,’ a report says. Couples . getting married when they are older may be also be a factor. ‘The age . at first marriage has been increasing, and previous research has shown . that those marrying at older ages have a lower risk of divorce,’  the . report says.","Those who end their marriage after seven years drops by a fifth in the past 15 years, according to the Office for National Statistics .

"A desperate mother has launched a social media campaign, in the fight to keep her son's foot from being amputated, after help was rejected. eight year old Joshua Turner has a rare disease AVM, called Arteriovenous Malformation which causes problems with blood flow in his foot . Eight year old Joshua Turner from Morphett Vale, in Adelaide's southern suburbs, suffers from a rare disease called Arteriovenous malformation, an abnormal connections between arteries and veins in his foot which causes significant blood flow problems. When doctors in Adelaide said they couldn't do anything for the youngster, the Turner family were forced to travel to Melbourne to see a specialist to seek treatment. Joshua's mum Kate Turner said it all started two years ago, after her son's fifth birthday, when he started to limp and complained of pain in his foot. 'I thought he had a broken bone.' she said. 'He was complaining of pain so he had an ultrasound, we knew something was wrong.' But when he had that ultrasound, it was found that he had a vascular malformation in his foot and was told he needed specialist treatment. 'He was referred to orthopedics SA, privately, they had no clue so they sent him to the women's and children's hospital,' said Ms Turner. 'Joshua had his first treatment in May, 2012, his first embolisation which went through the artery in the groin to the base of his foot.' 'They put an agent like glue in his foot to attempt to block up abnormal vessels but that was unsuccessful. They tried two more times and on the third attempt his toes went black.' A desperate mother has launched a social media campaign, in the fight to keep her son's foot from being amputated, after help was rejected. Joshua (pictured) after one of his operations he now needs another one to treated his foot . Dad Mike Turner (left), sister Jenna (middle left), Joshua (middle right) and mum Kate Turner (right) The Turners' are fighting to get financial assistance for Joshua to have treatment on his foot . Joshua's foot : The eight year old had a number of operations after being diagnosed with rare disease AVM but then it came back and he now needs another surgery to make sure his foot won't get amputated . Joshua contracted tissue nerosis but thankfully it was treated and repaired. 'The blackness pealed away and fell off and new skin grew,' she said, 'there was thought of amputation but his skin recovered, it was quite scarey.' In May 2013 they went to see doctors again to see if he could continue to be treated, but were told by they couldn't risk any more surgeries and if something had gone wrong, he would risk amputation. 'They said come back in 12 months, we will manage the pain.' Ms Turner said she was gobsmacked by their dismissal of his case and felt totally unsatisfied with the outcome, so she decided to do her own research and came across a radiologist in Melbourne she thought might be able to help. 'He was optimistic he could help,' she said. In September, Joshua was able to be seen by Melbourne doctor Anthony Pennington while he was at a vascular clinic and asked the family to hang around so other doctors could review his disease. 'We had an appointment with 12 doctors, all keen to have a look and they came to the conclusion that surgery was the best option and the best chance for him to save further nerve damage to his foot.' Footy Fan : Joshua recently got AFL tickets to go see the Hawks play Port Adelaide, a present to keep him upbeat (left) effects of AVM (right) 'He calls it his shark bite,' said mum Kate Turner (right) of Joshua's foot. Her son, 8, will need more surgery to treat his AVM and is asking the government to change it's decision for financial funding . The next month, a surgery was set up for Joshua, but three days beforehand the family hit a brick wall, when their health fund, Medibank private, refused to coff up to cover the surgery. 'They said it was a plastic surgery procedure,' said Ms Turner, 'I told them where to go and then we had to pay for Joshua's surgery which cost close to $5000.' 'He spent four weeks off school, six weeks in a backslab, ten weeks in crutches before he fully recovered and was walking again,' she said. 'He missed out on hell of a lot of school in the last two years, he stopped playing basketball, he had to modify activities, he loves kicking a footy but it is really difficult.' 'He can't put pressure on the ball of his foot, simple act of walking for a day is difficult. It's heartbreaking to watch.' 'He calls it his shark bite.' Due to his surgery, Joshua was required to have a follow up scan in Melbourne where his parents Kate and Mike were told the good news, the AVM was gone. All he needed was a follow up review in a years time. But the bad luck continued and his parents worse fears returned when they noticed Joshua developed similar systems in his foot in June, including limping again. The eight year old now needs again, to travel to Melbourne for surgery and will require three month follow up's to ensure his foot gets better. When the Turner's first discovered Joshua had a problem they took him to a GP and he was eventually referred to the Women's and Children's hospital in Adelaide (pictured) Joshua Turner, 8, (left) still need further treatment on his foot and must travel to Melbourne to see specialists. Mum Kate Turner (pictured right) has started an online petition to ask the government for financial assistance . But for the family, it's set to be a major financial struggle that will require thousands of dollars more for travel, accommodation, the surgery itself and the follow ups, because it can't be done in Adelaide. The SA Government, at first, rejected the Turner's access to the patient travel scheme, which means they won't be able to get a cent. 'I was totally shocked when they told me why. They're saying travelling to Melbourne for the only treatment that could save my son's foot is ""seeking a second opinion, said Ms Turner. SA health minister Jack Snelling (pictured) has said on ABC radio on Monday he will review Joshua's case and is confident the government will be able to help . 'It means they won't allow us into the patient transport access scheme, the only way we're going to be able to afford to get him to the hospital treatment every three months.' 'I just can't understand it. Amputating my eight year old son's foot is unacceptable to us.' 'It's a last resort. Specialists are saying they can save it, just the doctors in Adelaide don't offer the treatment.' 'It's as if they see saving my son's foot is a luxury,' she said. Ms Turner estimated the family had already spent about $10,000 on airfares, accommodations and surgery to fix Joshua's foot. She believes the costs to follow will be around $2500 to $3000 if not more, and could be ongoing if they have to continue to see a specialist in Melbourne. Desperate, she had no other options so decided to take her fight to social media and within a week had received 60,000 signatures for an online petition. 'Blown my mind how many people have signed and others struggling with similar circumstances,' she said. Joshua's foot pre-op, The eight year old has had to endure a number of surgeries because of his AVM . On Change.org they also included a letter written to SA premier Jay Weatherill pleading with him to reverse the government's decision for access to the scheme. While at first there wasn't much positives from the SA government on her case, Ms Turner received communication from SA health minister Jack Snelling on Monday morning. In a verbal agreement he said the government would review her case and possibly allow access to the patient travel scheme. 'I was a little reluctant because it was a verbal agreement, so I won't let it go until I get it in writing,' she said. The minister spoke on ABC's talk back radio and said he hopes it can all be resolved. 'I am very, very confident we’ll be able to ensure that she’s able to access PATS to travel to Melbourne to make sure her son gets appropriate treatment,' Mr Snelling said. 'It would seem … that Ms Turner’s son would be eligible for PATS, if not I’ll make sure that they are,' he told the ABC. *Difficulties with movement co-ordination . *Vertigo (dizziness) *Difficulty with speech . *Abnormal sensations . *Confusion . *Hallucinations . *Muscle weakness . *Paralysis . 'I’ll make sure that this gets fixed. I’ll contact Ms Turner today and make sure that this gets fixed,' he said. 'It's not only a financial burden on both my husband and I, I also work casually so to take the time off it's hard, I have to pay the household bills,' said Ms Turner. 'We want it fixed yesterday and if I could have his foot for him to have less pain, I would.'

"A curious smile playing on his face, the eyes and mouth are unmistakably human while the cheekbones and jutting brow say wild animal. Meet Karabo, probably our earliest ancestor and the ‘missing link’ between man and ape – ‘seen’ for the first time thanks to this incredible portrait. Created by paleo-artist John Gurche, it is based on the remarkably well-preserved skeleton of a boy aged around 13, found in a cave in South Africa. Link to our past: The portrait of Karabo is a 'forensic reconstruction' of the teenage male . Human-like: Skeletal hand of  the female found with Karabo (left). The skull of Australopithecus sediba (right) - the animal stood 4ft 4in and lived nearly two million years ago . Karabo – which means ‘the answer’ and is somewhat more catchy than his official name of Australopithecus sediba – stood 4ft 4in and lived nearly two million years ago. When he was discovered in 2008, the greatest shock for researchers was his human-like hand. Lee Berger, professor of evolutionary biology at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, said: ‘We’ve never seen that before. ‘It really is undeniable when you lay . it in your hand that it’s not a chimp. It looks like a hand capable of . making tools. He shares more with humans than anything else ever . discovered but is still so primitive and that’s exciting.’ Perfectly preserved: Karabo's skull was discovered in South Africa in 2008 . Just like us: Karabo and his species walked upright on two legs. Their small teeth may indicate they had found ways to process food using implements or even by cooking . The first bone fragment of Karabo was found by Professor Berger’s nine-year-old son near his father’s dig site. The . portrait was released as the skeleton – and the incomplete skeleton of a . woman in her 30s found with him, possibly his mother – went on display . at the Natural History Museum in London. Professor Berger said the picture was a ‘forensic reconstruction’ of how the boy would have looked, made possible because his skull was found intact. He said: ‘That is probably him. Normally with early human fossils, they are in such lousy condition, but here the anatomy is pretty much fixed. I think it’s the most accurate that’s ever been done. ‘It’s a more human-like nose than we have seen before, he’s just wrinkling it because he’s smiling, chimps can’t smile.’ The only guesswork involved the pattern of hair loss and the precise skin tone. But even these mysteries could soon be solved as Professor Berger’s team believe they have found on Karabo a sample of the protein keratin, which could lead to an analysis of his DNA. Karabo and his species walked upright on two legs. Their small teeth may indicate they had found ways to process food using implements or even by cooking. Studies in September hailed him as the best candidate for being a direct ancestor of homo erectus, the earliest modern human.","Paleo-artist bases painting on the well-preserved skeleton of a boy .

"TWO British couples saw their Spanish homes razed to the ground  after a near decade-long fight to save them. Regional government officials ended the struggle by the OAPs to save their dream retirement villas and sent in bulldozers to flatten them. British expats and more than a dozen local mayors protested by reading out a joint manifesto criticising the move before police cordoned off the area so the demolition workmen could go in. Homeowners Peter and Margaret Hegarty and Frank and Janet Doel have returned to the UK and were not present to see their £140,000 investments reduced to rubble. Scroll down for video . The dream retirement homes of Peter and Margaret Hegarty and Frank and Janet Doel were bulldozed after a decade long struggle to save them . Peter and Margaret Hegarty said their dream retirement home was 'snatched away' Retired car factory worker Mrs Hegarty, 71, originally from Glasgow but now living in Winchburgh, west Lothian, with her Northamptonshire-born husband said: 'We put more than 35 years' worth of savings into that house. 'I am disgusted at what's happened.' The couple bought their three-bedroom home in good faith in 2005 with the help of former steel worker Mr Hegarty's redundancy payment - believing it had been built legally - but were duped by the then-mayor Pedro Llamas and property developer Francisco Pedrosa. In 2012 a court found the former mayor guilty of falsifying documents and sentenced him to two years in jail, suspended because it was his first offence. He and the developer were ordered to pay compensation to the Hegartys, the Doels and two British couples whose neighbouring homes have already been demolished - but they declared themselves bankrupt and have yet to pay a penny. Graffiti exposing the injustice suffered by the Brits appeared overnight on the two properties near the pretty village of Cantoria, south east Spain, which were ransacked by vandals when the Hegartys and their neighbours moved out. Graffiti was scrawled on the properties before they were demolished saying 'punish the guilty, not the victims' The Brits' lawyer was told on Monday afternoon that the appeal to save the villas had been thrown out . One scrawl said in Spanish: 'Punish the guilty, not the victims.' Another, blaming the local Junta de Andalucia regional government for the fiasco, said in Spanish 'Junta culpable' - English for 'Junta, guilty.' The demolition followed the failure of an eleventh-hour appeal to save the properties on humanitarian grounds. The Brits' lawyer Alejandro Navarro was told on Monday afternoon the appeal had been thrown out. Mrs Hegarty said: 'We actually went out this morning because we didn't want to be sitting around thinking about it all. 'What's happened makes me so angry. We've had our dream retirement snatched away from us through no fault of our own and we've yet to see a penny in compensation. 'We live in hope we'll get some money back one day but I'm very doubtful it will ever happen.' The couples had bought their dream retirement homes in Cantoria in the south east of Spain . Maura Hillen, the chairman of campaign group AUAN which is fighting to reclassify thousands of illegally-built properties around southern Spain, was among the expats who witnessed the demolition. It was supposed to start at midday local time but began an hour late. AUAN says there is an estimated 300,000 illegally built homes in southern Spain, including some 5,000 around the Almanzora valley which includes the small village of Cantoria. She said: 'I came to record what was going on and show the world what the Junta de Andalucia is doing to foreign investors in the area. 'If this was my house being razed to the ground, I'd find it unbearable. 'The Hegartys and the Doels are going to be devastated when they see what's happened. Geraldo Vazquez-Legal advisor for AUAN inspects the Villas being demolished today . 'These couples have had nearly 10 years of stress, anguish and legal fees to deal with and they've received nothing by way of compensation. 'The state machinery has proved relentless against them when it should have been concerned with the people that have done wrong, not the victims.' The Junta de Andalucia promised there would be backing down in a statement released at the weekend. A spokesman said: 'The Cantoria houses will be demolished in compliance with a sentence passed by the Provincial Court. 'The Junta has no obligation to compensate the owners, since no right to compensation has been recognised. 'This right to compensation would be granted if the illegal buildings had had a licence which had later been declared void. 'This is not the case of the homes in Cantoria.' The British Embassy in Madrid estimates 4,000 Brits are fighting to save their homes in Spain. The first Brits to see their home demolished where Helen and Len Prior. Their villa in Vera, Almeria, was demolished in 2008 and they are still living in a garage while they await compensation. The Hegartys' neighbours in Cantoria, John and Jan Brooks, from Taunton, Somerset, had their property flattened last year. Their neighbours Clive and Gillian Davies also suffered the same fate.","Expats have fought a decade long battle to save retirement villas .

"Danish restaurant Noma, crowned the world’s best restaurant three years running in one poll, on Friday apologised after 63 guests fell ill with sickness and diarrhoea after visiting the haute cuisine establishment. According to the Danish health authorities, the guests fell ill during a five-day period in February and the outbreak could have come from a sick kitchen staff employee. Health inspectors criticised the restaurant for not alerting authorities soon enough and for not taking proper action after the employee was struck ill upon returning home after work.

"Symbols of fish and the sun, as well as intricate pattens of concentric circles and lines drawn by our ancestors, have been found etched into stones on a remote mountain in Mexico. Archeologists have discovered thousands of stunning stone-age carvings etched into rocks. They believe that they were made by our hunter-gatherer ancestors more than 6,000 years ago. The etchings are known as petroglyphs and are generally patterns made up of concentric circles and wavy lines, although there are also more representative images of deer tracks. A detail of one of 500 stones, which have been found by Mexican archeologists in Narigua, Coahuila state, Mexico . Archeologists said the characteristics of the carved stones vary depending on their location. Stones found in the main cluster in Narigua Sierra have etchings of strong points and concentric circles, although there are also wavy and broken lines. This image seems to show a fish in the foreground . Around 8,000 of the historic drawings were discovered and recorded in Narigua, a site in Northern Mexico. So far, 500 decorated stones have been found at the site, which measures two miles in radius and is the most important with so many of these 'petrograbados' in the Mexican state of Coahuila. Scientists think the carvings could have been made as part of hunting initiation rites or even represent the stars. They could give historians a clue of how . sophisticated stone age tribes were in the area and even an idea of the . kind of tools they used. The stones have around 8000 carved figures and probably have been made by hunter-collectors 6000 years ago . The pretroglyphs are scattered across the site and found on different parts of the mountain. Most of the rock art was found on the southern slope of the mountain, but there were also some found scattered at the foot of the north side. Gerardo Rivas, an archeologist at the . National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) said there is . evidence of stone age tribes having lived at the site. He . said that most of tribes lived in temporary settlements and that . archeologists have found stoves,  cooking pots and even arrowheads as . evidence. There is indication that the tribes were . making tools to survive and lived in huts made of perishable materials, . which were in some cases portable, he told Spanish language publication . Mimorelia. These ancient rocks were found in Narigua and cover an area of two square kilometres. INAH archeologists said that these petroglyphs are believed to come from pre-Hispanic hunter-gather groups that frequented the area . Archeologists have found evidence of camps in . two valleys that are separated by a small ridge, with the larger ones . located near Sierra de Narigua, where the largest group of carved rocks . was found. Mr Rivas said that the characteristics of the carved stones vary depending on their location. Stones . found in the main cluster in Narigua Sierra have etchings of strong . points and concentric circles, although there are also wavy and broken . lines. Stones with representations of deer tracks were found elsewhere. The archeologists also found relatively modern carvings of crosses probably made some time in the second half of the sixteenth century. The archeological study started in August last year and the Institute plans to allow tourists to visit the site where the rocks were found, which lies around 60 miles west of the Mexican city of Monterrey.","Mexican archeologists have found 500 carved rocks on a mountain that was inhabited by stone age tribes .

"An 8-year-old girl has recalled the painful and terrifying moment a dolphin lunged out of the water at a SeaWorld park and latched onto her hand, half pulling her back into the tank with it. Jillian Thomas of Alpharetta, Georgia said she was feeding the dolphins in Orlando, Florida and raised the paper carton she was holding 'when the dolphin saw that, it leaped at me and bit me, ate the carton.' 'It really, really hurt,' Jillian said in an interview on Monday with ABC's 'Good Morning America' where she showed her nearly healed injuries. Scroll down for videos . Recovering: Jillian Thomas, 8, smiles while recalling the then-terrifying moment a dolphin she was feeding at a Seaworld park lunged out of the water and bit her last month . Dolphin wounds: Jillian suffered three puncture wounds and a swollen left hand after the unexpected biting occurred . Seemingly safe: Jillian Thomas, 8, and her younger brother James were feeding the dolphins at Orlando SeaWorld last month when the incident occurred . Jillian suffered three puncture wounds to her hand. Her father Jamie Thomas, who was with her at the theme park when the dolphin lunged from its pool on November 21, described his reaction as: 'Instant fear.' 'I thought that, wow, I may have to lunge at the dolphin, and pull her or, get physically involved,' he recounted of all the thoughts swirling in his head. After pulling his daughter away from the pool, it was then a Sea World employee asked if they needed help. 'They asked if she wanted first aid, and I said ""she's bleeding"" so yes, we want first aid,' he recalled. Jillian held two dolphin stuffed animals as she recounted the ordeal, saying she hoped the dolphin didn't get sick from eating the paper carton. She's prayed for the animal at night. Close contact: Jillian's younger brother leans in close to feed one of the marine mammals . Unaware: Jillian turned away from the dolphin she was feeding fish scrap to but continuing to hold the now empty cardboard container within the dolphin's view . Painful moment: Jillian cringes as the dolphin bites down harder . Strong pull: The dolphin nearly drags Jillian into the water with it to her parents' horror . While dolphins are known for their playful behaviour and permanently painted smiles, they are also known for their sheer physical power and sharp teeth which have led to attacks on humans. Human feeding is linked behind many reported attacks though other incidents have been seen during moments of sexual aggression. Federal officials say dolphins are of little threat to people in captive swim programs - with in 1994 less than 1 out of 10,000 people injured - but those animals in the wild are far more spontaneous and unpredictable in their behaviour. Earlier this year in Louisiana a single wild dolphin was reported terrorizing residents in a waterside community in Slidell where it bit three people in June. In one incident a boater's hand was sliced open by the dolphin's teeth while he stuck his hand in the water to clean it. In another case a girl was dragged into the water by her ankle. Other reports described the dolphin as head butting and chasing acquaintances. Like many other incidents, officials in Louisiana said there were related reports of people feeding the dolphin and attempting to lure it out with food potentially leading to its association of all humans having food. 'Twice,' her mother said. The paper cartons are used to hold fish children and others feed the dolphins. Jillian's parents say park-goers may not realize the risk involved in feeding dolphins, which is why they posted video of the bite to YouTube, so parents can decide for themselves whether it is safe. Mr Thomas' daughter’s cuts are healing, he . said, but he and his wife are upset with the way SeaWorld employees . handled the incident, saying they trivialized the severity of it. SeaWorld officials said in a statement that the safety of their guests is paramount, and they are taking the situation seriously. 'Educators and animal care staff are always on-site at this area, monitoring all interactions and are committed to guest safety,' SeaWorld said in the statement. 'Educators and animal care staff were at the attraction when this happened and immediately connected with the family,' SeaWorld said. 'In addition, a member of our health services team was in the area at Dolphin Cove and quickly responded and treated the young girl.' ‘Thank God it didn’t pull her in the . water. It’s only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured . at this attraction,’ Thomas wrote in a message at the end of his video. This isn’t the first dolphin bite the park has seen. In . 2006, two adults pried open a dolphin's mouth to free a 7-year-old boy . from its grip, which left a bruise on the boy’s hand, according to . another Orlando Sentinel article. Setting an example: Appearing on Good Morning America on Monday, the girl's parents said they posted the video to show the dangers of hand feeding dolphins but don't plan to take legal action . Not the first time: SeaWorld has had trouble with its dolphins biting young visitors in the past . SeaWorld spokesperson Becca Bides at the time told the Sentinel that no changes were being planned for the attraction. Jullian’s mother, Amy Thomas, said she would have been more careful if she had known her daughter might get bitten. ‘I felt safe,’ she said. ‘Everyone . just imagines dolphins as smiling, non-biting animals with knobby teeth. You forget these are wild animals.’ The . Thomas family said they do not plan to take legal action against the . Orlando-based theme park, but said they would like Sea World to increase . the age limit for children feeding dolphins and remind parents that . dolphins aren’t always as friendly as they look.

"An Israeli arms company has revealed details of a laser defense system with 'Star Wars' style technology which can shoot missiles from the sky with a pulse of energy. State-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems said the futuristic military hardware called Iron Beam was almost ready for deployment. It works by firing a focused laser at targets which are heated so rapidly they disintegrate in an instant. Cutting edge: Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which currently makes surface-to-air missile systems, pictured, unveiled details of its High Energy Laser missile shield . The arms maker publicised specifications of its High . Energy Laser (HEL) at this week's Singapore Airshow, which is Asia's . largest aerospace and defense exhibition. 'It's exactly like what you see in Star Wars,' said company spokesman Amit Zimmer. 'You see the lasers go up so quickly like a flash and the target is finished.' The radical system is the culmination of five years to work involving solid-state lasers by 15 engineers, the company said. Iron Beam is designed to intercept close-range drones, rockets and mortars which might not remain in the air long enough for Israel's current Iron Dome missile defense system to intercept. Protection: Israel launches an Iron Dome defence missile in the southern Israeli city of Ashdod in response to a rocket launched from the nearby Palestinian Gaza Strip . Iron Dome batteries have shot down hundreds of rockets launched by Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip at Israeli cities. Countries are vying to weaponise laser technology. The U.S. Navy announced last year that it will attach a prototype of its Laser Weapons System (LaWS) to USS Ponce and send the amphibious transport docking ship to the Middle East in 2014. This will be the first time a laser weapon is used in active service. The blast of infrared energy it delivers can disable a small boat or even take down a drone from above as an impressive Navy video shows. Navy researchers told reporters that the laser gun, or a 'directed energy pulse weapon' as the military call it, destroyed its targets 100 percent of the time in testing. 'It operates much like a blowtorch... with an unlimited magazine,' a Navy official said. The solid-state laser prototype doesn't use up expensive ammunition so is cheap to operate. 'Its weapon round costs about $1 to shoot,' said Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, a Navy researcher. However, LaWS costs more to build in the first place - at around $32 million per unit. With no peace deal in sight and also . threatened by Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel wants to beef up that system . and develop further protection. Avnish . Patel, an expert in military sciences at the Royal United Services . Institute, said Iron Beam is potentially an effective addition to . Israel's defenses rather than a drastic change. 'Essentially, . its military and tactical utility will be particularly useful in . complementing the already proven Iron Dome system in tackling very short . range threats such as rockets and mortar fire and in close quarter . engagements,' he said. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems said test data show Iron Beam lasers are blasting away more than 90 percent of their targets. The new system can also be modified so that multiple lasers can be used . to hit a target, according to the company. But officials remain tight . lipped as to when and how the Iron Beam will be deployed. Zimmer, the company spokesman, said: 'It's very accurate and will help avoid collateral damage.' He added: 'When you use lasers, you have an unlimited magazine.' Besides Iron Beam and Iron Dome, . Israel is also developing the next phase of its Arrow system which can . intercept missiles in space and the upcoming David's Sling, which shoots . down short and mid-range ballistic missiles. But . some feel Israel, which gets significant funding from key ally the U.S. for missile defense capabilities, is going overboard. Fanar . Haddad, a research fellow from the Middle East Institute in Singapore, . said Israeli military superiority in the region was so firmly . established that Iron Beam was unlikely to change anything in the short . or medium term. Shield: The solid-state laser technology is designed to hit targets the current Iron Dome system, pictured, is unable to reach in time . Interception: An Israeli Iron Dome missile is launched near the city of Be'er Sheva, southern Israel, to intercept a rocket fired from Gaza . Reinforced: The Iron Beam system is designed to protect against objects which might not be picked up by the current Iron Dome defenses, pictured in this graphic . 'The development of another layer says more about Israeli paranoia,' he said. 'The possibility of a conventional attack against Israel is next to nil and there is hardly a need for five layers of missile defense systems.' Rafael Advanced Defense Systems would not comment on how much Iron Beam would cost or how much has been invested in it so far. 'It's very hard to say. We're still testing and it can be modified in many different ways,' Zimmer said. Other nations and private companies may be keen on using the laser based technology to protect against attacks. Israel has become one of the world's leading weapons exporters. Israeli arms companies often point out that they bring with them years of firsthand experience from conflicts with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, jihadi militants in Egypt's Sinai desert and Hezbollah guerrillas.","Laser shield can intercept drones, rockets, missiles and mortars .

"Blighted: Simon Ellis of Crowders . The Government is to be sued for more than £200,000 in damages by the country’s biggest grower of native trees over the delays in handling the outbreak of ash dieback disease. Robert Crowder, chairman and owner of Crowders Nurseries in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, has had to destroy 50,000 ash trees and is blaming three months of dithering and delay by  officials for his losses. He is furious that plant health officials who identified about 15 infected trees at his nursery in June issued an emergency order that prevented him from touching or removing the trees. It meant the disease spread like wildfire. Several hundred trees became infected before officials took any further action and on September 17 he was given just six weeks to destroy all 50,000 ash trees. Mr Crowder is also angry that the Government ignored warnings about the potential impact of the disease that the Horticultural Trades Association has been making since 2009. The Government has ruled out paying compensation for loss of diseased ash trees, but Mr Crowder, whose firm grows five million trees a year, is preparing to challenge this. He said: ‘We intend to take legal action. Officials have been slow to react to the potential danger of the disease.’ Officials turned up at the 200-year-old family firm in June. They had identified an infected tree in Leicester that had been supplied by Crowders and wanted to check other trees. Simon Ellis, marketing director at Crowders, said: ‘We were genuinely surprised. We could not understand where the disease came from. ‘We grow from English seed and occasionally if we have storm or flood damage we buy in extra stock from English suppliers. Threat: Ash trees across  the UK are endangered by dieback disease . Destroyed: The uprooted ash trees at the nursery . ‘It was only this summer we found out our supplier sent his young ash saplings to the Continent to grow and we bought 10,000 of them. Some went to Leicester for a park-and-ride scheme. ‘The usual advice when you get  disease in a tree is you lift it out of the ground and then you burn it. ‘They came at the end of June and found about 15 infected trees. But the officials did not know what to do. We waited and waited.’ On July 19 the firm received a notice. Mr Ellis said he expected this to be the order to destroy the trees. ‘But the notice stated the trees must not be pruned, lopped, trimmed or moved until further notice,’ he said. Horse-riders were urged to wash mud from their animals’ hooves to avoid spreading the disease. It was feared that their mounts could carry the fungus spores from one woodland to another. As the hunt season started this weekend, there were concerns that dogs from more than 200 packs of foxhounds, stag hounds and beagles  could move the spores across the countryside. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: ‘Everyone should be responsible.’ However, Defra said it would not impose any temporary bans on hunts. ‘Again we waited and were worried about the delays. Then on September 19 we got the destruction notice. By then several hundred trees were infected. ‘Then they decided we needed to get rid of all our ash trees, and there were 50,000 of them. We pulled them up and burnt them within two weeks, but we have lost at least £200,000. ‘We still can’t understand why they didn’t let us destroy the infected  trees in June. ‘The problem is that officials are  not experienced in recognising the disease or knowing what to look for.’ Crowders is one of 12 nurseries where the disease has been found in ash trees. But according to Mr Ellis it is the only nursery named in emails circulated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to other organisations involved in handling the outbreak. Mr Ellis said: ‘We are also going to sue for loss of reputation because we are aggrieved our company name is being repeatedly mentioned and linked to infected sites.’ A Defra spokesman said: ‘The 1967 Plant Health Act allows for an option of compensation for plant disease but there is no legal obligation. At a time when our trees face increasing threat from a range of diseases and when we are seeking to maintain tight controls on spending and reduce the deficit, it is our view  that resources are best spent on surveillance and other preventative disease-management activities.’ Two years ago I was in Kyoto, Japan. In the mountain woods around the city, about one-tenth of the trees had suddenly died within  six months, but not because anyone had failed to keep the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. Pines – much-loved historic trees in Japan – had been killed by a microscopic worm from America. Oaks, including a species closely related to English oak, had been slaughtered by a mysterious new fungus disease and the insect that conveys it. No one knew where it came from. What can I say about the new ash disease? I told you so. It fits a pattern that has been known, but not heeded, since my student days. I have been saying this for more than ten years in lectures and articles, and in my New Naturalist book Woodlands, published in 2006. The gravest threat to the world’s trees and forests is not people cutting down trees, nor climate change, nor even too many deer: it is globalisation of tree diseases. Most native plant diseases and pests have existed for millions  of years alongside their local host plants, which have come to terms with them, so they do only limited damage. This breaks down when people, usually inadvertently, bring them into contact with new host plants that are not adapted to them. Evolution does not provide an answer, because plants, especially trees, have long generation times. Fungi and worms can run rings round them in evolutionary terms. Plant diseases are being moved around the world and are subtracting tree after tree at random from lands that have no previous experience of them. I could quote 20 examples: European elm disease in America, the American vine pests and diseases that very nearly killed off wine-making in Europe, sweet-chestnut disease in Europe and America, etc. England has had alder disease, and the micro-caterpillar that turns horse-chestnut leaves brown, among others, but so far we been let off lightly, compared with Japan or Australia. Globalisation has gone into top gear in the past 40 years through the growth of international trade. Some of the responsibility lies with the tree-planting movement. Since 1973 (remember the Plant a Tree in 73 campaign?) planting ‘native’ trees has become institutional, with contracts to be bid for, work to be finished on time and budgets to be spent by the end of the financial year. An industry has arisen, geared to human administrators, which clashes with the behaviour of trees and their parasites. If English oak trees haven’t produced acorns this year, the contractor cannot wait until  next year but goes to a country where acorns are available. This stimulates a trade in living plants. Anyone importing a million container-grown hawthorns from Hungary – as if there were not enough hawthorns in Britain – inevitably imports 1,000 tons of Hungarian soil and whatever is in it. Planting imported trees, even if the original seed was ‘local’, carries a risk for existing trees. At a conference in Ireland in 2004, I remarked that the Irish had had enough experience of imported plant disease – the calamitous potato famine from 1845, caused by a fungus that fell off an American ship – to last them 1,000 years. The man from the Ministry got up and bleated that nothing could be done because this would restrict trade and the World Trade Organization would not allow it. Little seems to be definitely known about ash disease: nobody knows where the fungus came from, how it travels, how long it has been here, or even how many of the trees are killed. The fungus kills the shoots, and the tree produces a bunch of replacement shoots – but this can happen from other causes as well. Perfect health is not the normal state of trees. Ash disease is difficult to recognise, indeed probably impossible until next spring, now that most ash leaves have fallen. What is to be done? Probably nothing effective in the present state of ignorance. Talk of exterminating ash trees within 20 miles of an infection cannot be taken seriously given the vast numbers of trees and the practical difficulty of finding and destroying them – and the need to repeat the performance every time ash disease is detected, until there are no ash trees left. It seems that any of the world’s plant diseases is at liberty to enter Britain provided it does so via some other European Union country. By the time the problem has been detected and the bureaucracy has clanked into action, it is too late. Once a tree disease has become established in a country, it is almost unknown for it to be controlled, let alone exterminated.

"More than one in five Britons live in fear they will lose everything in a natural disaster - seen here in five stunning images of what could happen if the UK was hit by extreme forces of nature. A poll of 2,000 people for the UK Natural Disaster Report - put together by TV channel Yesterday - found that 21 per cent were worried their lives would be devastated by some form of natural disaster. The report, released to coincide with the premiere of Yesterday's show Perfect Storms: Disasters that change the World, asked the 2,000 people to rate the events they were 'most worried about'. More than one in five Britons live in fear they will lose everything in a natural disaster. The image shows how the Houses of Parliament might look if there was a catastrophic flood in London . The poll compiled a list of the top 10 natural disasters people worried about, with flooding coming top, with 52 per cent saying they were scared their homes could be wrecked by rising water. In second place was severe cold, with 38 per cent saying they were concerned about their loved ones perishing in freezing weather. In third place were earthquakes - which although rare in the UK, notched up 21 per cent of the vote. To accompany the poll, the channel released five images showing stunning 'disaster scenarios' which could occur in the UK, including the Houses of Parliament ravaged by a flood, and Edinburgh Castle hit by a tornado. Other images include the Angel of the North after an earthquake, Trafalgar Square frozen over, and a meteor shower hitting London Embankment. The Top 10 list was analysed by Dr Bruce Malamud, a professor of Natural and Environmental Hazards at King's College London, who assessed the risks using data from the Government's recent National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies (NRR report). Some 52 per cent of people say they are scared their homes could be wrecked by rising water if there was a flood. Image shows what Trafalgar Square might look like if Britain was suddenly plunged into an ice age . The poll revealed that 21 per cent of Britons are afraid that they could lose everything in an earthquake. However, earthquakes are not believed to pose a serious risk to the British public. Image shows how the Angel of the North could look following an earthquake . The NNR report states that the 'highest priority risks' are pandemic influenza, flooding, terrorist attacks and gas-rich volcanic eruptions from abroad, such as the 2010 eruption in Iceland which affected the UK. Other risks, categorised as 'newly assessed risks' include wildfires, infectious diseases, severe space weather such as radiation storms, severe weather and droughts. The poll for Yesterday found that 21 per cent of people believe they would be affected by a natural disaster in their lifetime - with just four per cent worried they would be affected by war or military action and 21 per cent also worried of total economic collapse in the UK. The government considers the 'highest priority risks' to the British public to be pandemic influenza, flooding, terrorist attacks and gas-rich volcanic eruptions from abroad. Image shows how London might look during a meteorite shower . Some 21 per cent of Britons believe that they will experience a natural disaster during their lifetime. Image shows how Edinburgh Castle might look during a tornado. There are an average of 30 tornadoes a year in the UK but they tend to be quite weak . Professor Malamud said: ‘In my opinion, public education about our environment is very important, so people have a good awareness of the threat posed by natural hazards. ‘Increasing population, climate change, movement of people from rural to urban areas and an ageing population are all contributing to the potential increased severity and frequency of natural disasters in certain places around the world.’ The show, Perfect Storms: Disasters That Change The World, will explore the biggest and most significant natural disasters of all time, especially those which have shaped the course of history. It will and air tonight at 9pm on Yesterday. 1.    Flooding - 52 per cent of Britons fear their house could be destroyed in a flood. Experts say that there is only a medium likelihood of it happening . 2.    Severe cold - 38 per cent of Britons are worried about severe cold. Experts say that severe cold is the most likely natural disaster to hit the UK . 3.    Earthquakes - 21 per cent of Britons worry about earthquakes. Experts say there is a very low likelihood of a damaging earthquake hitting the UK . 4.    Droughts - 21 per cent of Britons worry the UK could run out of water. The Government's NNR Report lists droughts as being of medium likelihood . 5.    Asteroid showers - 20 per cent of Britons worry about meteorite and asteroid showers. They are listed as being a very unlikely danger to the UK . 6.    Heat wave - 17 per cent of Britons fear the UK will be hit by a dangerous heat wave. Experts believe heat waves are a 'genuine concern' 7.    Tsunamis - 15 per cent of Britons worry that the UK could be hit by a killer wave. Experts say the risk of low . 8.    Landslides - 12 per cent of the UK population worry about landslides. They pose a localised threat, with a medium-high likelihood, but low impact . 9.    Tornadoes - 11 per cent of people worry about tornadoes.There are an average of 30 tornadoes in the UK each year but they tend to be weak . 10.  Volcanic eruptions - seven per cent of Britons worry about the impact of volcanoes. Experts say the danger rating of volcanic eruptions should be on the same level as flooding and drought. Volcanoes are listed as having a medium likelihood with a medium-high impact .","Poll for TV channel Yesterday revealed that one in five Britons live in fear they will lose everything in a natural disaster .

"The U.S. Navy’s standard-issue blue digitized camouflage fatigues are highly flammable and will burn ‘robustly until complete consumption,’ a report revealed last month. The findings show that the digital-print camo, which is made from 50 percent cotton and 50 percent nylon, will drip as it burns, causing potentially hazardous burn injuries. But the Navy’s top spokesman said that the government organization is aware of the report findings, and added that sailors had asked for a fade-resistant uniform that was also comfortable. Scroll down for videos . Danger zone? The Navy Type I blue and grey fatigues were found to by highly flammable and would drip and melt onto skin if ignited . Test zone: An impromptu test conducted on October 15 revealed that the new nylon-cotton uniform was highly flammable; according to the report, the material melts and drips as it burns . Safety first: Rear Adm. John Kirby, the chief of information at the Pentagon and spokesman for the Navy, said in a video published last month that the uniform was found to 'burn robustly until complete consumption' Rear Adm. John Kirby, the chief of information at the Pentagon and spokesman for the Navy, said in a video published last month that while the uniform was found to ‘burn robustly until complete consumption,’ it’s not shocking. ‘That is not a huge surprise because it’s a 50 percent nylon uniform,’ he said, but added that it wasn’t a requirement for the military-issue uniform to be at all flame resistant. The impromptu test was conducted on October 15 by the Navy Clothing Textile Research Facility, located in Natick, Massachusetts. In the test, a strip of the new nylon-cotton blend uniform was exposed to a flame for 12 seconds. The cloth immediately lit up in flames, and continued to burn after the fire source was removed, the report said. According to the report, the material melts and drips as it burns, contributing to an increased risk of burn injury. Adm. Kirby told the Virginian-Pilot that the camouflage, known as the Navy’s Type I NWU, was designed with sailors in mind. Blend: The digitized print is made from a 50/50 nylon-cotton blend that is wrinkle-resistant . Ashes: Compared to other Navy uniforms, the 12-inch strip of NWU I fabric was totally consumed when exposed to flame . He said that Navy workers wanted a uniform ‘that was comfortable, that didn’t require maintenance, and would stand up under a lot of washing.’ The admiral added that a nylon-cotton blend was a good way of getting the type of garment these sailors wanted that would also meet their needs. According to the Pilot, there is plenty of flame-retardant gear located throughout every Navy ship, meaning that the standard-issue uniforms need not be flame resistant. Fire: While serious fires aboard aircraft carriers and other Navy ships are uncommon, they do happen. In 1967, the U.S.S. Forrestal ignited after a series of explosions; 134 sailors were killed . Additionally, Adm. Kirby said in a statement that ‘the safety of our sailors, both afloat and ashore, remains a paramount concern. Nothing changes about that. And nothing changes about the wear of the NWU Type I aboard ship or installations.’ An editorial in the Navy Times estimated that it could cost as much as $20million to gradually phase-in a fire-retardant uniform, but noted that most sailors would ‘gladly pay an extra $50 per set to know that their uniforms will protect them if their ship ever catches fire.’ While serious fires aboard aircraft carriers and other Navy ships are uncommon, they do happen. In 1967, the U.S.S. Forrestal ignited after a series of explosions. In total, 134 sailors were killed.

"A full-size replica of the famous Great Sphinx of Giza will be dismantled in China after complaint from Egypt. The 30-metre-high, 60-metre-long structure in northern Hebei province has provoked outrage from Egypt's ministry of antiquities, which has voiced its displeasure to Unesco. A Chinese official has said the replica, which is made from steel bars and cement, will only be used as a temporary scene for shooting movies and television dramas.

"Enough planets exist in the Milky Way to ensure that there is at least one for each of the hundred million stars in the galaxy, NASA has revealed. Analysis of data from the Kepler space telescope shows that 17 billion planets in the galaxy are Earth-like in size. The findings are making scientists increasingly confident of finding a rocky planet the same size as Earth, with a similar orbit and situated in the 'habitable zone' of a solar system. Scroll down for video . This artist's illustration represents the variety of planets being detected by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It is now believed - 17 billion Earth-like planets could exist in the Milky Way . An artist's impression of Kepler-20e, one of the planets identified by the Kepler space telescope mission . 'The analysis of increasingly longer time periods of Kepler data uncovers smaller planets in longer period orbits -- orbital periods similar to Earth's,"" said Steve Howell, of NASA's Ames Research Center in  California. 'It is no longer a question of will we find a true Earth analogue, but a question of when.' One of the most exciting findings is that four planets have been identified which are less than twice the size of Earth and orbit in their sun's habitable zone, the region in the planetary system where liquid water might exist on the surface of a planet. Latest findings released by NASA show that since February last year there have been 461 potential new planets discovered. These bring the total number of potential planets that have been identified by the Kepler mission to 2,740 and they orbit 2,036 stars. A breakdown by size of potential planets identified by the Kepler mission. Among the most dramatic increases is in the number of Earth-sized and super Earth-sized planets. Discoveries of Earth-sized planets increased by 43 per cent while those of super Earths rose by 21 per cent. Caltech planetary astronomer John Johnson said: 'We are showing that there is about one planet per star, and that gives us a total of about a hundred billion planets throughout our galaxy. 'The vast majority of those planets are orbiting stars that are very much different from our sun.' Several of the planets being identified are in the same solar system, just as Earth is one of eight planets orbiting the Sun. 'The large number of multi-candidate systems being found by Kepler implies that a substantial fraction of exoplanets reside in flat multi-planet systems,"" said Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist at Ames. 'This is consistent with what we know about our own planetary neighborhood.' The Kepler space telescope was launched by NASA in 2009 with the intention of finding Earth-like planets. It pinpoints potential new planets by measuring the dimming of starlight as planets pass between stars and the telescope. Not all dimming is caused by planets and it is only once dimming has been observed three times that it is formally attributed to a potential planet. Further measurements and observations are required to confirm the identification. In the last year the number of confirmed planets pinpointed by Kepler has risen from 33 to 105.

Harvard-Smithsonian Center presented the latest Kepler findings at a . meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach, California, . on Monday. The Astrophysical Journal has accepted a paper detailing the research for publication. Christopher Burke, a scientist at the . SETI Institute which researches signs off extra-terrestrial . intelligence, said that 58 planets found so far are believed to be in . their host stars' habitable zones. That means that any water on them has a chance of being in liquid form because the region is close enough to the star to be warm enough for ice to melt but not so close that it all evaporates. Near death: A new photo of Eta Carinae system's largest star suffering a near-death experience before it goes supernova in the near future . Planets orbiting close to their suns are likely to be infernos while planets in distant orbits are likely to be icy, he said. Burke also analyzed the latest Kepler data. The Kepler Space Telescope launched on March 7, 2009, and has been active for 3 years, 10 months and 1 day as of January 8, 2013. The space observatory was named in honor of the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler. Kepler is part of NASA's Discovery Program which runs relatively low-cost scientific research missions. The observatory’s mission going forward is to find and document Earth-sized planets at greater distances. The more planets discovered with Earth-like orbits in their habitable zones, the greater the chances of extra-terrestrial life, scientists say.

"They were was built in 1928 by Western Union and AT&T to bring the telephone to Manhattan. Today, the skyscrapers, among New York's first, are still at the cutting edge of communication. It has been hailed as one of the world's best connected buildings, and is home to one of the biggest internet 'switch' points in the world, helping bring the internet to the US. Scroll down for video . Each room has biometric security, and is now home to glass rooms housing many of the world's most popular websites. The building at 60 Hudson is home to one of the biggest internet 'switch' points in the world, helping bring the internet to the US. When the Western Union and AT&T Long Lines buildings were built in the early 1930s, New York was already the largest city in the United States. As the largest city in the nation and the financial capital of the US, New York also had the most telephones of any city in the entire world. With that excess of telephones came a need for communication hubs to filter traffic—exactly what these two buildings came to provide. Between 1928 and 1932, Western Union and AT&T built two of the most advanced telecommunications buildings in the world at 60 Hudson Street and 32 Avenue of the Americas in Lower Manhattan. 'Nearly a century later, the Western Union building and AT&T Long Lines building remain among the world's finest Art Deco towers—and cornerstones of global communication,' said Blake Mitchell of Telx, the firm which operates the data center housed in the building. 'They remain the central switchboards of our telecom culture; home to 400 carriers serving 600+ data networks—among the most richly connected buildings in the world,' he said. Each building has incredibly strong foundations and rich connections throughout the city. It has been upgraded with biometric security, and is now home to glass rooms housing many of the world'' most popular websites. Western Union needed to communicate with AT&T’s network, which it used for its long-distance telegraphs.

'We here at Telx are proud of the rich history of these landmark buildings and that we are also part of their legacy as we continue to use them for their original intention: working day to day as communication hubs for customers all over the world,' Telx said. 'As the film notes, the Western Union and AT&T Long Lines buildings are not monuments to a vanished age; they’re contributing directly to the recycling life of the city.'

A British man was freed by Ukrainian secret services after being kidnapped and tortured while seeking a potential 'bride' through a dating agency in Odessa (pictured) The man, aged 58, was abducted by a 'criminal gang', believed to be Muslim, after arranging to meet a young woman . He was held in a cellar for three days while his relatives were contacted in Britain and told he would be killed if they did not pay £3,700 to save his life. 'The scared family made several Western Union transfers of several thousand dollars before finally deciding to contact the Ukrainian embassy in the UK, which then passed the information about the victim to the police,' said Volodymyr Shabliyenko, spokesman for the Interior Ministry. The address where he was held was stormed by police and secret service officers and the man released 'unharmed'. The kidnappers - believed to include three Muslim men and a Ukrainian woman - were arrested. The gang's leader was said to be 'a native of the United Arab Emirates who was in Ukraine illegally'. 'They tortured the man and threatened to kill him if his family failed to pay ransom,' stated a local report. It gave no details of his 'torture'. 'The group included four perpetrators, a Ukrainian woman, two Pakistanis and a native of North Caucasus,' said an SBU intelligence agency source. The kidnappers - believed to include three Muslim men and a Ukrainian woman - were arrested by Ukrainian security officers (stock image) 'The perpetrators tracked down well-off foreign tourists and operated according to a well-trodden scenario. 'Using dating and social-networking websites they lured a foreigner into a meeting where instead of the expected date he would get into the hands of his kidnappers.' The Britisn man - a frequent visitor to Ukraine - 'fell into the trap. 'Having replied to a Ukrainian Bride invitation, the Englishman found himself taken hostage. 'His ordeal lasted for several days in a dark basement - he was told to call his relatives and tell them about the $6,000 ransom for his release.' Shabliyenko said: 'The victim has an interest in architecture. He had visited Ukraine about 15 times as a tourist. 'He was particularly excited about the architecture of Odessa; this year alone he had visited the city twice to study local architectural monuments. 'The foreigner hired a flat, frequently strolled around the city and ended up in the sights of a criminal group led by a native of the United Arab Emirates who was staying in Ukraine illegally.' The detainees face jail if convicted of illegal imprisonment and conspiracy to commit robbery. 'The only fact we know about his family is that his relatives live in London,' said an Interior Ministry source. We do not think there was any Islamic or political motive here. They were just criminals who wanted money,' said the source. 'We know Martin John visited Ukraine more than a dozen of times in the past.'","A man named as Martin John, 58, was kidnapped by Muslims in Ukraine .

"Fearing a Russian invasion and occupation of Alaska, the U.S. government in the early Cold War years recruited and trained fishermen, bush pilots, trappers and other private citizens across Alaska for a covert network to feed wartime intelligence to the military, newly declassified Air Force and FBI documents show. Invasion of Alaska? Yes. It seemed like a real possibility in 1950. 'The military believes that it would be an airborne invasion involving bombing and the dropping of paratroopers,' one FBI memo said. The most likely targets were thought to be Nome, Fairbanks, Anchorage and Seward. Declassified: Fearing a Russian invasion and occupation of Alaska, the U.S. government in the early Cold War years recruited and trained fishermen, bush pilots, trappers and other private citizens across Alaska for a covert network to feed wartime intelligence to the military, newly declassified Air Force and FBI documents show . Feared the Russians: Hoover teamed up on the highly classified project, code-named Washtub, with the newly created Air Force Office of Special Investigations, headed by Hoover protege and former FBI official Joseph F. Carroll . So FBI director J. Edgar Hoover teamed up on a highly classified project, code-named 'Washtub,' with the newly created Air Force Office of Special Investigations, headed by Hoover protege and former FBI official Joseph F. Carroll. The secret plan was to have citizen-agents in key locations in Alaska ready to hide from the invaders of what was then only a U.S. territory. The citizen-agents would find their way to survival caches of food, cold-weather gear, message-coding material and radios. In hiding they would transmit word of enemy movements. Main players: This 1961 photo released by the Defense Intelligence Agency shows Air Force Lieut. Gen. Joseph Carroll upon his nomination to first director of the Defense Intelligence Agency . This was not civil defense of the sort that became common later in the Cold War as Americans built their own bomb shelters. This was an extraordinary enlistment of civilians as intelligence operatives on U.S. soil. This account of the 'Washtub' project is based on hundreds of pages of formerly secret documents. The heavily censored records were provided to The Associated Press by the Government Attic, a website that publishes government documents it obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The Russians never invaded, of course. So the covert cadre of 'stay-behind agents,' as they were known, was never activated to collect and report wartime information from backwoods bunkers. It was an assignment that federal officials acknowledged (to each other, if not to the new agents) was highly dangerous, given that the Soviet Union's military doctrine called for the elimination of local resistance in occupied territory. To compensate for expected casualties, a reserve pool of agents was to be held outside of Alaska and inserted by air later as short-term replacements. This assignment was seen as an easier sell to potential recruits because 'some agents might not be too enthusiastic about being left behind in enemy-occupied areas for an indefinite period of time,' one planning document noted dryly. 'Washtub' was not, however, a washout. It operated from 1951-59, according to Deborah Kidwell, official historian of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, or OSI. 'While war with the Soviet Union did not come to Alaska, OSI trained 89 SBA (stay-behind agents), and the survival caches served peacetime purposes for many years to come,' she wrote in an OSI magazine last year. With the benefit of hindsight, it would be easy to dismiss 'Washtub' as a harebrained scheme born of paranoia. In fact it reflected genuine worry about Soviet intentions and a sense of U.S. vulnerability in a turbulent post-World War II period. As the plan was being shaped in 1950, Soviet-backed North Korea invaded South Korea, triggering a war on the peninsula that some in the Pentagon saw as a deliberate move by Moscow to distract Washington before invading Europe. The previous summer the Soviets stunned the world by exploding their first atomic bomb. Also in 1949, the U.S. locked arms with Western Europe to form the NATO alliance, and Mao Zedong's revolutionaries declared victory in China, adding to American fear that communism was on the march. Washtub: This undated handout image obtained by The Associated Press shows an Air Force chart showing the organization, by function and lines of authority, of the Washtub project . Close: A map shows the jarring proximity of Russia to Alaska, the closest point of which is just 2.3 miles from country to country via the islands of Little and Big Diomede . 'Washtub' was known inside the government by several other codenames, including Corpuscle, Stigmatic and Catboat, according to an official Air Force history of the OSI, which called it one of OSI's 'most extensive and long-running Cold War projects.' The FBI had its own code word for the project: STAGE. 'Washtub' had two phases. The first and more urgent was the stay-behind agent program. The second was a parallel effort to create a standby pool of civilian operatives in Alaska trained to clandestinely arrange for the evacuation of downed military air crews in danger of being captured by Soviet forces. This 'evasion and escape' plan was coordinated with the CIA. Among those listed as a stay-behind agent was Dyton Abb Gilliland of Cooper Landing, a community on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage. A well-known bush pilot, Gilliland died in a plane crash on Montague Island in Prince William Sound in May 1955 at age 45. FBI records say he spent 12 days in Washington D.C., in June-July 1951 undergoing a range of specialized training, including in the use of parachutes. The agents also got extensive training in coding and decoding messages, but this apparently did not always go well. Learning these techniques was 'an almost impossible task for backwoodsmen to master in 15 hours of training,' one document said. Details in the document were blacked out. Many agent names in the OSI and FBI documents also were removed before being declassified. None of the indigenous population was included. The program founders believed that agents from the 'Eskimo, Indian and Aleut groups in the Territory should be avoided in view of their propensities to drink to excess and their fundamental indifference to constituted governments and political philosophies. It is pointed out that their prime concern is with survival and their allegiance would easily shift to any power in control.' Codenames: Washtub was known inside the government by several other codenames, including Corpuscle, Stigmatic and Catboat, according to an official Air Force history of the OSI, which called it one of OSI's 'most extensive and long-running Cold War projects.' The FBI had its own code word for the project: STAGE . Recruiters pitched patriotism and were to offer retainer fees of up to $3,000 a year (nearly $30,000 in 2014 dollars). That sum was to be doubled 'after an invasion has commenced,' according to one planning document. The records do not say how much was actually paid during the course of the program. At least some recruits were fingerprinted and all were secretly screened by the FBI for signs of disloyalty. The FBI linked one candidate, a resident of Stony River, to a list of names in a 1943 bureau file on 'Communist Party activities, Alaska' that tracked U.S. subscribers to a magazine called 'Soviet Russia Today.' Another candidate was flagged - falsely, it turned out - as a likely communist sympathizer based on an FBI informant's tip about membership in the 'Tom Paine Club, Communist Party, Spokane, Washington.' A September 6, 1951 memo in which FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover says it's time to pull the FBI out of Washtub and refers to Pearl Harbor . One was described in a May 1952 OSI memo to the FBI office in Anchorage as the postmaster in Kiana, Alaska; another was manager of a hotel in Valdez. One agent candidate worked for a tin-mining company at Lost River on the Seward Peninsula, one of the higher-priority areas for placing 'Washtub' stay-behind agents. The peninsula is named after Secretary of State William H. Seward, the primary negotiator in the 1867 purchase of the Alaska territory for $7.2 million from czarist Russia. The FBI tapped its local contacts, including federal judges, the head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage, an Anchorage physician and others for names of reliable Alaskans to be approached. 'Washtub' was crafted in painstaking detail. But just as the first trained agents were to be put in place in September 1951, Hoover pulled out, leaving it in OSI's hands, even though one month earlier his top lieutenants had advised him the FBI was 'in these programs neck deep,' with an 'obvious and inescapable' duty to proceed. Hoover worried that when the shooting in Alaska started the FBI would be 'left holding the bag.' 'If a crisis arose we would be in the midst of another `Pearl Harbor' and get part of the blame,' Hoover wrote in the margin of a Sept. 6, 1951, memo from an aide, to whom Hoover added one final order: 'Get out at once.' Three years later, Hoover was pulled back in, briefly. In October 1954, an envelope and a typewritten letter containing a coded message were turned over to the FBI by a woman in Anchorage. It had been misaddressed by the anonymous sender in Fairbanks. Espionage was suspected, triggering flurries of FBI internal memos. Hoover was informed that bureau code breakers were urgently trying to decipher the message. They never broke the code but eventually declared the crisis over. The mystery message, they determined, was not from an enemy spy. It was a 'practice message' sent errantly by one of the 'Washtub' agents.","J.

"Lord Ahmed of Rotherham thinks halal should be made available as an option . The Palace of Westminster has rejected demands to serve halal meat in its restaurants. Muslim MPs and peers have been told they cannot have meat slaughtered in line with Islamic tradition because the method – slitting an animal’s throat without first stunning it – is offensive to many of their non-Muslim colleagues. The stance has infuriated some parliamentarians who have eaten meat in the Palace’s 23 restaurants and cafes, having been assured that it was halal. Lord Ahmed of Rotherham said: ‘I did feel misled. I think a halal option should be made available.’ In 2010, the Mail on Sunday revealed schools, hospitals and restaurants were serving halal meat to unwitting customers. Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Somerfield and the Co-op all said they stocked meat slaughtered according to Islamic tradition without letting customers know. Fast-food chains including Domino’s Pizza, Pizza Hut, KFC, ­Nando’s and Subway are also using halal meat without ­telling customers, it was revealed. Members of the Church of England have complained that the spread of halal meat was 'effectively spreading Sharia law' across Britain. The Palace of Westminster has rejected demands to serve halal meat in its restaurants . However, a spokesman for the House of Lords and the House of Commons confirmed that it was not served in their restaurants. Alison . Ruoff, a member of the Church of England, said: ‘It’s a bit . hypocritical that the Houses of Parliament, which have allowed other . people to provide halal food, have ruled it out on their own premises.’ When the meat is slaughtered, Islamic verse is uttered before the animal has its throat slashed. At Halal slaughterhouses thousands of birds are killed every hour.

"When Cesc Fabregas followed Thierry Henry in leaving the captain's armband at Arsenal behind to join Barcelona, there were suggestions that the Gunners had become a feeder club. Poaching Arsene Wenger's biggest stars has become somewhat of a trait at the Nou Camp, with Gunners fans wary of speculation every summer linking a star man with a move to Catalonia. But has it been all bad? Barcelona have splashed a staggering £123million on Arsenal players, most recently signing Thomas Vermaelen - now out for up to five months - for £15m. When Cesc Fabregas left Arsenal to join Barcelona, there were suggestions the Gunners were a feeder club . But Alexis Sanchez has hit the ground running following his £30m move to the Premier League . Thomas Vermaelen cost Barcelona £15m but has yet to feature and could be out for up to five months . Cesc Fabregas £31m . Thomas Vermaelen £15m . Alex Song £15m . Aleksander Hleb £12m . Thierry Henry £16m . Gio van Bronckhorst £2m . Marc Overmars £25m . Emmanuel Petit £7m . Total: 123m . Couple that with the instant impact of Alexis Sanchez in north London following his move from the La Liga giants, and Arsenal look to be coming up trumps. In fact, Barca's transfer fees sent over to Arsenal cover almost a third of the cost of the Emirates Stadium, £390m. It all started in the summer of 2000, with Barca poaching full internationals Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit for a combined price of £32m. At 27 and 29, Wenger may have thought the duo's best years were behind them. That proved to be the case. Speedster Overmars played 97 times in four seasons but found regular starting opportunities limited, with the fans getting on his case too, while French midfielder Petit stayed for just one season before joining Chelsea. Barcelona's transfer fees to Arsenal almost make up a third of the cost of the Emirates Stadium . Mark Overmars left Arsenal for £25m but was never a star at Barcelona . Emmanuel Petit left at the same time as Overmars but only stayed for a year before joining Chelsea . Aleksander Hleb could never fit in during his time with the La Liga giants . Spanish publication Sport splash on Vermaelen . The timing of these sales by Wenger can usually be commended. Aleksander Hleb split opinion at the Emirates Stadium before struggling at Barca following an £12m move, as did Alex Song despite a fine final season. The Cameroonian midfielder, worth £15m two summers ago, is now rebuilding his shattered reputation back in the Premier League with West Ham. Henry, sold at 29, and Fabregas had similar difficulties fitting in around a team of superstars under Pep Guardiola. The midfielder, poached from the La Masia academy as a teen by Arsenal, has recently admitted he is 'enjoying his football again' with Chelsea having toiled at Barcelona. The £31m the Gunners received was considered to be short change at the time. Still, Arsenal's reputation of supplying Barca with some of their finest players was in tact. But now,  even the local press are condemning the board's actions in Spain. Daily publication Sport use Song as the poster boy when insisting Barca have 'wasted their money on Arsenal players'. Vermaelen's lengthy lay off has also added strength to these accusations. But it's the form of Sanchez that has seen a change in tide. Thierry Henry was sold at 29 for £16m, and never quite hit his top form again . Arsene Wenger chats to Fabregas on the training pitch before the midfielder's move to his hometown club . Arsenal are now competing with the very best, and have signed a genuine world class talent in Sanchez . The Chilean was frozen out at the Nou Camp. Not content with waiting around in the wings any longer, the 25-year-old seeked a move to the most competitive league in the world, and has hit the ground running despite his £30m price tag. Eight goals in 10 Premier League games, 13 strikes in all competitions, the quality Sanchez is bringing forward at present is head and shoulders above the rest of his team. There is a feeling around Arsenal that for the first time the club have purchased a genuine superstar, one of the best in the world. And it just so happens they brought him in from 'parent club' Barcelona.Who would have thought it?

"Mia Farrow has admitted that Frank Sinatra may be the father of her son, instead of Woody Allen. Rumours . about the parentage of her son Ronan, 25, have long dogged Mia Farrow, and she finally addressed . the issue in an interview saying the legendary crooner was 'possibly' his father. But on Wednesday, in reference to the claims, Ronan Farrow put in his two cents by tweeting: 'Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son.' It comes as . her adopted daughter Dylan spoke for the first time about how she is . tormented by 'crippling' fears over her alleged abuse at the hands of . Woody Allen in a new Vanity Fair article. Claim: Mia Farrow has admitted Frank Sinatra may be the father of her son Ronan, instead of Woody Allen . Dylan Farrow reveals that she refuses to ever say her famous adopted . father’s name and admitted: ‘I’m scared of him, his image.’ The . Oscar-winning director, now 77, has always vehemently denied his former . partner Mia Farrow’s claim that he sexually molested Dylan and no . charges were brought after the scandal made headlines around the world . 20 years ago. Elsewhere in . the interview, Farrow, now 68, said that . Sinatra was the great love of her life, and says, 'We never really split . up.' Relationship: Farrow fell for the legendary crooner Frank Sinatra and married him in 1966 when she was 21 and he was 50 . Earlier bonds: Woody Allen and Mia Farrow walk as Mia carries their son Satchel, who later changed his name to Ronan . When Vanity Fair asked . Sinatra's daughter about Ronan being treated as if he were a member of . her family, Nancy Sinatra Jr told them: 'He is a big part of us, and we . are blessed to have him in our lives.' Farrow married Sinatra in 1966 in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. The . marriage fell apart 18 months later when she refused to drop her . critically-acclaimed performance in Rosemary's Baby to star in a movie . with her husband. They divorced in 1968. Two . years later, Farrow married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn. The . couple adopted three children and also had three biological children . before divorcing in 1979. In . 1980, Farrow started a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, . although the two never lived together. Farrow became Allen's muse and . starred in 13 of his films, most notable Hannah And Her Sisters in 1986. Any similarities? Farrow dropped the bombshell that Sinatra, left, could be the biological father of her son, Ronan (right) in a Vanity Fair interview. He has taken to Twitter to dismiss her claims . Old life: Allen is pictured with Farrow and two of their children, Dylan Farrow and Satchel - now Ronan . Her . relationship with Allen ended in 1992 when she discovered he was having . an affair with her oldest adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. It was believed that the . news Allen may not be his father could be welcome to Ronan - the . pair had a very public falling out when Allen began his romantic . relationship with Previn. Claims: Dylan Farrow, pictured with adopted father Allen in 1989, claimed he sexually abused her . 'He's . my father and married to my sister. That makes me his son and his . brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said. 'I . cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be . morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they . are my family. To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all . adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship. Following . the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Woody's possession, Farrow . launched a messy custody battle over their three children. During . the proceedings, which were closely followed, Farrow claimed that Allen . had sexually abused Ronan's sister Dylan, though the judge dismissed . the claims because they were not substantiated. But . Dylan – who is reportedly married and has changed her name to Malone – . now says: ‘I have never been asked to testify. If I could talk to the . seven-year-old Dylan, I would tell her to be brave, to testify. ‘There’s . a lot I don’t remember, but what happened in the attic I remember. I . remember what I was wearing and what I wasn’t wearing,’ she tells Vanity . Fair’s November issue. ‘The . things making me uncomfortable were making me think I was a bad kid, . because I didn’t want to do what my elder told me to do.’ The . attic, she adds, pushed her over the edge. ‘I was cracking. I had to . say something. I was seven. I was doing it because I was scared. I . wanted it to stop.’ Special role: Ronan is a former U.S. Global Youth Issues envoy and worked alongside Hillary Clinton . She . told the magazine that for all she knew ‘this was how fathers treated . their daughters. This was normal interaction, and I was not normal for . feeling uncomfortable about it.’ The . ‘Midnight in Paris’ director’s New York publicist was unavailable for . comment on the claims early today. His lawyer Elkan Abramowitz told the . magazine that he still denies the allegations of sexual abuse. 1966: Actress Mia Farrow married Sinatra in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. 1968: The couple split just 18 months after getting married and got divorced. 1971: Mia Farrow then married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn.They went on to adopt three children - Lark Song, . Summer Daisy Song, and Soon-Yi - and had three biological children - . twins Matthew and Sascha and finally Fletcher. 1976: Frank Sinatra married Barbara Marx. 1979: Farrow and Previn divorced. 1980: Farrow started dating Woody Allen. They adopted two girls - Moses and Dylan. 1987: Farrow gave birth to a boy, Ronan, on December 19. Ronan was the only biological child of the couple. 1992: The couple split when Farrow discovered Allen was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. 1992 - 1995: Farrow went on to adopt six more children - Tam, Kaeli-Shea, Frankie-Minh, Isaiah Justus, Thaddeus Wilk and Gabriel Wilk. 1998: Frank Sinatra died. He was still with his third wife Barbara Marx at the time of his death after 22 years of marriage. 2013: Farrow has now suggested Sinatra may be Ronan's father as they never 'really split up'. Dylan claims in her first interview that Allen contacted her twice by post. The . second time, during her senior year of university, a large stuffed . manila envelope arrived at the school, filled with pictures of the pair . of them together. According . to her, the accompanying letter read, ‘I thought you’d want some . pictures of us, and I want you to know that I still think of you as my . daughter, and my daughters think of you as their sister. Soon-Yi misses . you.’ Eight of Farrow’s 14 adopted and biological children spoke for the article. Fletcher . Previn reveals that he . has photoshopped Allen out of every single family photo and edited him . out of family videos so that none of them would ever have to see him . again. 'We can look at them and be reminded of the good and not be reminded of the bad,’ Fletcher tells writer Maureen Orth. Of . the two decades old scandal, he adds: ’There were casualties, who were . totally derailed. It had a different impact on everyone, but everyone . had a reaction.’ Fletcher singles out his sister Lark, who died at 35. ‘I really do think he’s got some blood on his hands,’ he says of Allen. Farrow . had a 12-year relationship with Allen, whose latest film ‘Blue Jasmine’ had the director’s best ever UK opening this summer - but the couple . never lived together. She and the children stayed in her massive Upper West Side New York apartment while he had a home on the other side of the city. In . a 2005 interview, Allen confirmed that he no longer has relationships . with his three children from his relationship with Farrow. Ronan's Twitter page is full of celeb photos including one with Jemima Khan, right and left with Katy Perry . 'Well, . I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in . court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair. Today, . Farrow is far removed from the media circus. Her focus is now activism, . in Africa, as a UNICEF ambassador and on more than 20 missions of her . own, particularly to the Darfur region of Sudan and to neighboring . Chad. Ronan says he is ‘so proud’ of his large family. Still together: Woody Allen and his wife Soon-Yi who married in 1997 . ‘I . grew up across the table from Moses, who has cerebral palsy, and next . to my sister Quincy, born of a drug-addicted inner-city mother, and . Minh, who is blind,’ he tells Vanity Fair. ‘I . could never have understood what it means to grow up blind or with . cerebral palsy. I saw problems and needs, so the next thing you think . is: ""O.K., what are you going to do about it?"", he adds. And the strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back; and he has been deemed a child prodigy. He . enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving . on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a . year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree. Since . leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special advisor to the State . Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and . Pakistan. He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009. After . working under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, Ronan is now . moves into the ranks of her husband, former president Bill Clinton, with . Monday's Rhodes scholarship nomination. In spite of the drama, Soon-Yi and Allen stayed together, eventually marrying in 1997. The couple have since adopted two children named Bechet and Manzie Tio, their names paying homage to two jazz musicians. 'The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to those things,' Allen has said.","Actress said singer may 'possibly' be father of her 25-year-old son Ronan .

"Hours from death with a brain tumour, Emma Bassett went on a rollercoaster ride – and it saved her life. The schoolgirl had no idea of the danger she was in when she visited a theme park days before a hospital appointment to discover why she was suffering bad headaches and dizziness. But when she finally saw the doctors, they told her she had a tumour so big it had stopped vital fluid moving around her brain. The rollercoaster had relieved the build up of pressure by briefly redistributing this liquid. Survivor: Emma Bassett was hours from death when she was diagnosed with a huge brain tumour at 12 - but has now made an incredible recovery . This had bought her precious extra . days, and she was able to undergo an operation the next day. Even so, . doctors warned her that this could leave her in a vegetative state. But eight years on, Miss Bassett has stunned them all by making a complete recovery. She has learned to walk and talk all . over again, and is about to begin a career as a primary school teacher. Miss Bassett was 12 when she started to feel unwell and was referred to . hospital for tests. The weekend before the appointment, . her mother Gina took her and a group of friends to Thorpe Park, where . she rode on the Nemesis Inferno rollercoaster. Life-threatening surgery: Doctors at St George's Hospital in Tooting told Emma's parents the tumour had been growing in her brain since she was five . At the time she had a satsuma-sized . tumour blocking the flow of cerebrospinal liquid in her brain. Doctors . later said the tumour had been growing since she was six and she had . just hours to live when she went on the ride. Miss Bassett, now 20, from Twickenham . in west London, said: 'It was such a shock to discover I'd had this . tumour growing inside me, probably for years, without me knowing . anything about it. Brain scan: The tumour has grown to the size of a satsuma - and was so advanced that young Emma was just hours from death . 'The doctors told my parents that I . would need 24-hour care, because the tumour was wrapped about my brain . stem, and the surgeons thought removing it would cause irreparable . damage. 'After the operation, I couldn't walk, . talk, or even feed myself. But I was determined I'd walk again and beat . the tumour. It has taken years of hard work, but now, I'm finally able . to do the things I've always wanted to and live the life I've always . wanted to lead. At my latest scan, there was no sign of the tumour . returning, so it's great news.' Miss Bassett has had numerous . operations over the past eight years, spending a year with her leg in a . splint, then two years walking with a crutch. Long journey: Miss Bassett had to relearn how to walk, talk and eat after the surgery - which doctors feared could leave her in a vegetative state . Lucky to be alive: Miss Bassett is now training to be a primary school teacher and campaigning to raise awareness about the early signs of brain tumours . The Nemesis Inferno at Thorpe Park, which Emma rode and which may have saved her life . She then had to have . special soles put into her shoes to support her walking. But now the . only sign of the tumour is a slight paralysis on the left side of her . face. She said: 'I have had so much . hydrotherapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy to get me where I am . today. The doctors thought I might make slight improvements  after my . operation, but they have since told me they never expected me to come . anywhere near as far as I have.' Miss Bassett has now teamed up with . the Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust to champion their HeadSmart . campaign, which aims to raise awareness of how to spot the early signs . of a brain tumour.","Tumour diagnosed when she was 12 - after it had grown to size of satsuma .

"A couple who plan sail around the world with their three-year-old daughter have said the dangers are no greater than those posed 'on the school run'. Kim Brown, 39 and her husband Simon, 47, have faced criticism for potentially putting their toddler in danger by taking her on their three-year, round-the-world tour. The couple will be sailing in a modest 56ft yacht and will face stormy seas and dangers posed by pirates as they circumnavigate the globe. Setting sail: Kim Brown considered turning back from the three-year family adventure after her daughter Sienna turned into a 'hell child' The Browns are setting off from Gibraltar today to sail around the Mediterranean before making the 3,000-mile Atlantic crossing in November to reach the Caribbean. They plan to educate their daughter, Sienna, during their travels and say their yacht, Britican, will be stocked with medical supplies in case of an emergency. However, writing on her website, Kim said she feels there has been an air of condemnation about their decision to take a young child on such a long voyage. Young adventurer: Kim admitted that some criticised her decision to take Sienna to sea while she is so young - and said there had been temper tantrums . Family at sea: Simon was a PE teacher for under 21s at Aylesbury Prison before giving up his job to make his dreams of a round-the-world adventure come true . She wrote: 'People . ask, ""Is it safe for you to sail to certain locations with your . daughter? Will she wear a life jacket? Can she swim?"" 'And . then we get a few questions regarding health risks such as, ""What . happens if Sienna gets sick? What will you do if she needs medical . attention? What if she gets malaria?"" 'For . the most part I think people are genuinely interested, but I can’t help . but feel that some of the questions are asked with a tone of . condemnation. 'Friends and family can’t say, or don’t have the courage to say, ""are you crazy - how irresponsible can you get?"" 'Of . course, I could be way off the mark on this, but I sometimes feel . judged when people shout at me, ""But what about your child?”' Sea legs: Sienna Brown's behaviour has improved since Kim found a parenting book online which gave useful advice . The couple gave up their jobs and sold their six-bedroom house in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to buy the yacht and fund their three-year trip. Simon, who is originally from London, had been working as a PE teacher for under 21s at Aylesbury Prison while Kim started up two successful currency exchange and property businesses. US-born Kim grew up in New York state and regularly went boating on Lake Ontario. The couple also practised their sailing skills on The Solent to prepare for the round-the-world voyage. On board: Simon and Kim set sail from Gibraltar and are currently exploring the Greek islands before crossing the Atlantic later this year . Kim added: 'From what I’ve read, . children that spend more time with adults - eg. homeschooled kids - . actually tend to have more advanced social skills. 'Rather than learning both the good and bad traits from their school peers homeschooled children mature a bit quicker. 'Let’s face it, Sienna is less likely to be a bully, be bullied, act immature for her age or be mean.'","Kim and Simon Brown plan to spend three years sailing the world .

"Russell Brand has blamed the disgraced Chelsea fans' racist thuggery in Paris on football's recent £5 billion TV rights deal . Millionaire comedian and self-styled anarchist Russell Brand has blamed the disgraced Chelsea fans’ racist thuggery in Paris on football’s recent £5 billion TV rights deal. ‘If you treat fans like they don’t matter, like they’re not worthy of grace, then it isn’t surprising that some behave disgracefully,’ writes Brand on his blog, under the heading ‘£5.1bn a high price for racism?’ ‘When fans take back the clubs that are theirs, and run them collectively, aberrant acts like the Metro racism can be communally condemned from a just position, not the altar of cold profiteering and cunning hypocrisy.’ However, he insisted he was not trying to excuse racism. Brand, 39, a West Ham supporter, accused the Premier League of ‘garnering huge wealth and hogging it for itself’, rather than ‘sharing the bounty with fans’. His comments sparked outrage among some blog followers. One called him a ‘damn hypocrite’ while another described him as ‘a fraud’. Others defended the comic. Responding to Brand, a Premier League spokesman said: ‘Regardless of ownership models, racist behaviour is not acceptable as part of the game or society.’ Meanwhile, police have launched a new investigation into fresh racism allegations against Chelsea supporters. CCTV recordings are being studied for evidence of abusive chanting by fans at London’s St Pancras Station. They were returning from the club’s Champions League game against Paris St Germain last week, where a group of Chelsea fans had been filmed pushing a black man off a Paris Metro train. So far Chelsea has suspended five men from its Stamford Bridge ground. The Met Police has released three photos of suspects. None has been named by police although supporters have identified five as either witnesses or participants. They are Josh Parsons, a 21-year-old City worker, and his younger brother, Benji; Jordan Munday, 20; Mitchell McCoy, 17; and 23-year-old Jamie Fairbairn.

"A shocked mother is facing a £10,000 bill after a huge sinkhole deeper than a double-decker bus appeared overnight in her back garden, almost swallowing her daughter's trampoline. Insurers say it hasn't damaged Gretel Davidson's home in Barnehurst, south east London, so they won't payout for any repairs. The collapse comes as a 10-mile section of a busy motorway remains closed because of a 15ft-deep sinkhole in the central reservation. Gretel Davidson is facing a £10,000 bill after a huge sinkhole appeared overnight in her back garden . Gretel Davidson thought her daughter Mia, 12, was exaggerating when she called her to say a huge black hole had appeared in the middle of their lawn. The 55-year-old didn't realise the extent of the hole until she got home and peered into the void last Wednesday. Insurers say it hasn't damaged Gretel's home so they won't be paying her any money to fix the problem . Gretel, a radiographer at Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford, Kent, said: 'I just feel totally helpless. Mia rang me to say ""Mum there is a massive hole in the garden"". 'I didn't really believe her and just thought she was going over the top. It is just unbelievable to think a hole that size could appear overnight and out of nowhere.' She added: 'I got in touch with the council but they said they couldn't help because it's my own property. 'I then got in touch with Halifax, my home insurance, and they said the hole is too far away from my home so they couldn't help either. 'I am just devastated. I spent the whole weekend crying and have been doing everything I can to try and sort it out.""' Structural engineer Dan Baker, director of D J B Structural Engineers Ltd in Erith, looked at the hole and is drawing up an action plan. He said: 'It is a naturally occurring oblique swallow hole. It could cost upwards of £10,000 to fix. 'It is just one of those things you cannot predict - a total act of God. 'They are not common but they have been known to happen in this area in the past. 'Thankfully nobody was in the garden because someone could have died. We have got to make it safe as soon as possible.' The sinkhole, which is deeper than a double-decker bus, almost swallowed her daughter's trampoline . A Bexley Council spokesman added: 'Under such circumstances, the reinstatement work becomes the responsibility of the owner. 'Although the council is not liable for the reinstatement work, it is happy to provide advice. 'The owner was advised to contact her insurance company to see if her policy covers the incident. 'Our structural engineer also discussed the standard method used in the past to fill in these holes and provided the contact number of a reputable building contractor so that she could obtain a quotation.' A spokesman for Halifax Insurance said: 'Following a thorough investigation our engineers are confident that this sinkhole has not caused any damage to the property and poses no threat to the structure of the home, therefore it is not covered by the insurance policy. Not another one: This sinkhole - about 16ft long and 6ft wide - led to the section being closed . 'As a gesture of goodwill however, we will offer to put a fence up around the sinkhole in the interest of health and safety.' The motorway sinkhole appeared on the M2 in north Kent, between junction 5 near Sittingbourne and junction 6 south of Faversham. The hole - about 16ft long and 6ft wide - led to the section being closed from early yesterday afternoon, leading to big tailbacks on routes leading to and from the Kent coast. The Highways Agency (HA) said work was continuing to find out what caused the hole to open and that the section remained closed for safety reasons. The HA added that the site had been monitored overnight, while equipment and materials were being organised and deployed to the site ready for the agency’s contractors to start work as soon as it is safe to do so. A signed diversion is in place via the A249, the M20, the A20, the A252 and the A251.","A sinkhole deeper than a double-decker bus appeared in a back garden .

"In the tunnel at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, it was easy to reminisce and think back to the time when Jose Mourinho told Frank Lampard he had become the world's greatest player. The sad thing about these two, texting buddies when Mourinho was at Inter Milan and Real Madrid, is that they appear to have lost touch. Sometimes life moves on, too quickly in this case. There was an uneasy handshake with Chelsea's manager, some skin on skin as Lampard settled into the visitors' technical area before the 1-1 draw, but it was not the same. Frank Lampard (left) and Jose Mourinho awkwardly shake hands before kick-off at Stamford Bridge . Lampard, pictured under pressure from friend John Terry, returned to face his old club Chelsea on Saturday . Mourinho stays focused on the game as Lampard prepares to come off the bench for the champions . The Premier League board will decide whether to fine Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho for his latest vow of silence. The Portuguese did not speak to the press following Saturday's clash with Manchester City after the FA banned Diego Costa. Last Friday's press conference was also cancelled. Premier League chiefs will write to Mourinho and Chelsea for their reasons before the case is taken to the board. 'I don't want to try to say that there's any issue at all,' admitted Lampard after his 13-minute appearance as a substitute for Manchester City. 'I got a text at Christmas, I texted him back. We spoke in the dressing room, 'How's the family?,' the usual. 'We are grown men, you know what I mean? We are at different football clubs. I'm sure we are big enough that none of this is going to get in the way of our relationship and how we are personally. 'We remain close. This is football, it's sport and I haven't spoken to him that much recently. 'I don't think there's room for bitterness and if there is then I'll deal with that down the line.' Lampard dealt with his return to Stamford Bridge in the way that anyone who has come across him during his professional career would expect him to: unruffled, polite, respectful and courteous. There were a few dissenting voices at Stamford Bridge when he appeared as a 77th-minute substitute for the champions but his return home went as well could be expected. Chelsea fans unfurled a banner in tribute to Lampard as the midfielder made his return to Stamford Bridge . The former England midfielder was given a largely positive reception from the home fans . But this Chelsea was unhappy with Lampard's decision to join title rivals Manchester City . In the end, after these title rivals went away with a point each, Lampard went into the Chelsea dressing room to share some memories of the three Barclays Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the Champions League that they won together in Chelsea's golden era. 'It was lovely to get that reception at the end from the fans,' he added. 'I really appreciate that and I'm a lucky boy. 'I was nervous in general, to come here and be part of the away team is a bit nerve-wracking. 'I went in the dressing room afterwards and saw all the people behind the scenes, loads of faces, it was brilliant.' Lampard still has the drive and the desire to add another Premier League title before he leaves City at the end of the season to move to New York City. Loic Remy places the ball past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart to put his side in the lead . Chelsea striker Remy celebrates with the home fans after being given a chance in the absence of Diego Costa . This result, if not the performance, suited leaders Chelsea and Manuel Pellegrini's team have their work cut out to retain the Premier League. Five points is a lot of ground to make up. 'Chelsea finished the first half of the season with 45 points, so it could be 90 or more,' admitted Pellegrini. 'Of course the more points we drop the more difficult it is. We have to close a gap of five points, so it's important not to drop more points. But I'm sure all the teams will drop points.' There is rarely any conviction or authority in Pellegrini's voice, but he knows what it takes to win the title after his side saw off the challenge of Liverpool last season. Lampard has been there before and although his loyalty to Chelsea remains rock-solid, there were signs on Saturday that there is some genuine affection for City. David Silva pokes home Manchester City's equaliser after a shot from team-mate Sergio Aguero . Aguero and Silva celebrate following the Spaniard's goal just before half time . He agreed with the reaction of City's dressing room — they were convinced they should have won this game. Lampard's assessment was about right. 'In terms of chances in the first half, City were the stronger team and possession-wise in the second half,' he said. 'The result is probably better for Chelsea in terms of the league. We were in the dressing room there feeling that we probably might have won the game. 'It kind of leaves a nice balance. You lose that game and some people would write you off. This keeps the league ticking over. 'The race is on and you are talking about the two best teams in the country.'","Frank Lampard returned to Stamford Bridge with Manchester City .

"With its white sandy beaches and year-round sunshine, the Goodfellow family couldn't wait to leave their dreary home in Hull to start a new life in Australia. But just two months after making the move of a lifetime, the family-of-three have returned to Britain - because of the sky-high price of teabags and the lack of Robinson's squash in Australia. Siobhan and Andrew Goodfellow spent £10,000 to move with . two-year-old daughter Savannah halfway around the world from their home in Hull to Adelaide in September last year. Home sweet home: Siobhan and Andrew Goodfellow, pictured with their daughter Savannah, have returned to the UK just two months after starting a new life in Australia . Move of a lifetime: The Goodfellows spent £10,000 uprooting their life in Hull, pictured left, to start afresh in Adelaide, Australia, pictured right . But far from experiencing the life of luxury she'd expected, Mrs Goodfellow and her family were left shocked at the soaring cost of living in the country - with the final straw coming when she couldn’t find her daughter’s favourite juice in the supermarket. Having never been to Australia and with no family and only few friends living in the country, the idea to move struck Mrs Goodfellow after watching STV documentary series ‘Poms in Paradise’ about Brits who have settled in Sydney. Mrs Goodfellow, 35 said: ‘I’m really impulsive and I can be quite a bully when I’ve made my mind up on something but this was a big decision so I left it with Andrew for a few weeks to think about. I didn’t think he’d say yes. I didn’t think he’d leave his mum. ‘It was only when he came back to me and said, I think we should definitely do it, that I started taking it seriously. ‘Because of my daughter’s age we said it would be the right time, when she wasn’t going to be affected because she wasn’t in school or anything.’ Not living the dream: Siobhan Goodfellow, 35, said the cost of living in Adelaide, pictured, was sky-high . So the couple decided to move over 10,000 miles from the three-bedroom, semi-detached house in Hull they had shared for eight years, to start a new life in Adelaide. Mrs Goodfellow started looking for a replacement job in recruitment in April while Mr Goodfellow, 40, agreed to leave his job as a forklift truck driver and stay at home looking after Savannah until they were settled down and he could start looking for work himself. They booked themselves on to a 32-hour flight leaving from Newcastle airport on September 3rd, packed their furniture into a shipping crate and let their property to a young family with two children. They even sent their eight-year-old Dalmatian Molly to have vaccines and get a pet passport. When they landed the family checked themselves in to a plush, two-bedroom hotel apartment in the centre of Adelaide, which came with a shared swimming pool, until they found somewhere to rent. But the dream quickly unravelled. Mrs Goodfellow continued: ‘We knew almost straight away that something wasn’t right, but we just didn’t say anything to each other. Big ideas: Siobhan Goodfellow had never been to Australia but made the decision to move there after watching the STV documentary series 'Poms in Paradise' about Britons who have moved to Sydney . Taking the plunge: Andrew Goodfellow, pictured . left with his daughter Savannah, gave up his job as a forklift driver to . make the move to Australia - hoping it would provide a better life for . his little girl, pictured right . ‘It just wasn’t what we were expecting. You think you’re going to be able to go out there and afford a great quality of life because the wages are all higher, but it’s also really, really expensive. ‘I drink green tea and out there a box of 80 green tea bags can cost £8. You can spend £80 on shopping and only come away with two carrier bags. ‘It’s the little things you miss as well, like not being able to get my daughter’s favourite juice. All they have over there is the thick Ribena cordial and she likes Robinson’s apple and blackcurrant. I remember going round the shops and thinking, what are we going to do?’ After just two weeks in their new home the pair sat down in their apartment and had a tearful conversation. She continued: ‘One night we were sitting in the apartment and Andrew got upset and asked if I felt the same way. That’s when we realised we both felt the same but just hadn’t wanted to say anything. ‘We missed our families more than we thought we would, and talking to them was difficult because of the time difference. ‘We said we would go on a bit longer and see how we felt but we both knew from then.’ Homesick: Andrew Goodfellow, 40, and his wife Siobhan found they missed their home comforts and couldn't find their daughter's favourite Robinson's squash when they reached Adelaide, pictured . Urgent calls were made to the Port of Manchester where their furniture was sitting on the dock waiting to be loaded onto a ship. The couple asked staff to hold it, before telling Mrs Goodfellow’s sister not to put their dog on a plane which would have cost them another £4,000. They then called the travel agent and booked flights home for the following week, but in their indecision called back twice to delay it. ‘We were uneasy about it but we had to make a decision. Before we left there was no doubt in my mind that it was going to work. We thought our daughter was going to grow up Australian. ‘We both looked at each other when we got the airport and thought, are we doing the right thing?’ Eventually the family ended up living with family in Newcastle by the end of October - just two months after leaving. Mrs Goodfellow continued: 'I don’t think Savannah ever realised what was happening, she just got on with it. Costly move: The Goodfellows decided to return to the UK before their pet dog Molly, pictured with Savannah, was sent out to Australia to join them - which would have cost them £4,000 for the flight alone . ‘We were worried about the amount of flying she’d have to do but she was always really good and never complained. ‘When we tell her about this in a few years she’ll probably say: “you did what?!”’ Mrs Goodfellow is now working for her former recruitment company in Durham, while her husband works shifts driving cargo on and off ships at nearby docks. They are sharing a house with her sister while they try and find somewhere new to live. She said: ‘We have always wanted to move to the North East and now seems the perfect time. The family renting our old house have offered to buy it and all our things are already in storage.' But despite their disastrous first attempt at settling in Australia, Mrs Goodfellow admits she could be tempted to try it again in the future. She revealed: ‘I would go back to Australia, to Perth or Sydney or Melbourne, but not to Adelaide.' On average, the cost of living in Australia is significantly higher than in Britain.

"This is the dramatic moment a mother-of-two opened fire with an assault rifle on intruders who tried to smash their way into her home. The woman took action after three hooded individuals kicked down the door of her Detroit home on Monday night where she lives with her two young children. She fired off rounds in a bid to deter the would-be burglars, later saying she 'didn't have time to get scared'. Scroll down for video . Three intruders (pictured) were scared off by a mother who opened fire after they smashed their way into her home . One of the intruders smashed in the door of the Detroit home before the mother attempted to scare them off by firing her rifle . The teenage intruders fled from the house in Detroit after the shots were fired by the mother protecting two young children . The unnamed mother told WXYZ Detroit: 'I let them know I had a gun once they were in the house and they challenged me and said ""no you don't have a gun"" so that's when I shot off the first round. 'I wasn't feeling anything at the moment, I got scared afterwards.' The mother added that her young daughter told her: 'Oh no mommy, I don't want them to take my piggy bank or my toys.' The incident was caught on tape after the family installed cameras following a similar break-in. As the intruders fled the home while shots rang out, one dropped a handgun. He grabbed it and tried to get back into the house but was scared off by more shots. All three suspects are seen running through thick snow from the house. No one was hurt in the incident. Police arrested three teenage suspects a short time later. The mother said she 'didn't have time to get scared' as she started firing the gun (pictured) in a bid to scare off the three teenagers . In June last year it was reported that a 10-year-old Brooklyn boy fought off two intruders at his home by picking up a gun and firing a shot after one of the invaders dropped their weapon. Two people dressed as FedEx delivery men knocked on the door to the house around 5:30pm, the NYPD said. When two teenage sisters opened it, the intruders pushed past them and went to the second floor, where the boy was in his bedroom. The woman took action after the intruders kicked in the door of her Detroit home (pictured) and headed inside . The boy's mother managed to slam the second-floor door on one of the would-be robber's arms, leading him to drop his gun. Police say her 10-year-old son then picked up the gun and fired a round. One of the suspects fired back, but no one was hit and the suspects fled.

"Kris Boyd showed little mercy to former club Kilmarnock as he grabbed Rangers' second goal in the 3-0 Ibrox win which eased the Light Blues into the William Hill Scottish Cup last 16. The former Scotland striker was left on the bench by boss Ally McCoist but netted just 90 seconds after coming on as a second-half substitute. Nicky Law had given the Championship side a 19th-minute lead with his deflected opener and swept home another with a fine finish six minutes from time. Nicky Law, assisted by Fraser Aird, opened the scoring in the 19th minute with a shot from outside the box . Law's Rangers team-mates celebrate with him after his first-half goal at Ibrox . The Rangers players congratulate Kris Boyd after he doubled Rangers' lead in the second half . Law adds his second, and Rangers' third, goal of the game to send them through to the quarter-finals . It was a welcome win - their third victory over top-flight opposition this season - for under-pressure boss Ally McCoist after last week's defeat to promotion rivals Hearts. And it was also a good day for Boyd. He returned to Ibrox in the summer after a 22-goal stint with Killie last season but has struggled to repeat the lethal form of his record-breaking first spell with the club. But he wasted no time in punishing a mistake by best friend Craig Samson in the Rugby Park side's goal with the crucial second as the visitors slumped to their fifth straight defeat. Killie's last visit to Ibrox was six days after the club was plunged into administration in February 2012. Since then the Light Blues faithful have endured a living nightmare that shows no sign of relenting. Last week's 2-0 defeat at Tynecastle leaves them nine points adrift in the race for automatic promotion back to the Premiership, while their off-field woes continue to roll on with this week's news that the club lost another £8.3million in the year up to June 30. The home fans once again showed their frustrations by staying away in their droves, leaving a meagre crowd of just 14,412 to watch the action. Early sniffs at goal from Rangers' Lewis Macleod and the visitors' Rory McKenzie offered hope of an open affair. But it was not until the 15th minute that a genuine attempt on target was registered.

Kilmarnock manager Allan Johnston and his opposite number Ally McCoist on the touchline at Ibrox . Striker Kenny Miller, who is enjoying his third spell at Rangers, tries to hold off Craig Slater . Defender Bilel Mohsni dived in on McKenzie down on the right touchline but the Killie winger skipped past the challenge before pulling the ball back for Alexei Eremenko. The Finnish playmaker's shot did not look threatening until it skipped off Lee McCulloch's boot and squirmed a fraction wide with Steve Simonsen wrong-footed. But it was Rangers who got the breakthrough. Darren McGregor launched a long throw into the box which Killie failed to clear further than Fraser Aird on the edge of the box. The Gers winger had to shove referee Brian Colvin out the way before stabbing the ball back to Law, who saw his right-foot sweep deflect off Sammy Clingan's brow on its way into the top corner. The goal sparked Rangers into a sudden burst of industry. Macleod stung the hands of Samson with a 25-yard strike while Kenny Miller claimed for a penalty after Ross Barbour slid in on him just as he was about to pull the trigger. The right-back came from the wrong side but Colvin correctly judged that he took the ball. Daly heads the ball during the second half at Ibrox while Chris Chantler watches on .

Samson then tipped away Ian Black's grass-cutter while Clingan's under-cooked header back to the keeper almost put Kenny Miller in, but Killie made it to the break without any further losses. Allan Johnston's team were livelier after the break, with Tope Obadevi giving McGregor problems down the left. But Rangers should have put daylight between the teams on 58 minutes. Aird danced past Chris Chantler before whipping a cross to Macleod at the back post, but the Scotland Under-21 cap ballooned his shot high into the Copland Road stand. Jon Daly found himself through on goal with 25 minutes left but pace was never one of the Irishman's strongest attributes. His decision to play in partner Miller - rather than press forward himself - drew a huge groan from the crowd, especially when his pass failed to find its target. The former Dundee United frontman could have little complaint when he was replaced soon after by Boyd - who rubbed his team-mate's nose in it by taking just 90 seconds to make his mark. Aird's corner was met by McCulloch but Samson should have gathered it. His spill though fell straight at the feet of former Rugby Park colleague Boyd, who showed little sympathy by ramming the ball home at the near post. Law then put the seal on the win as he collected Foster's pass from the left before curling a delicious finish past the helpless Samson.","Rangers beat Kilmarnock in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup .

"‘I am a bit embarrassed still to be talking about it 43 years on,’ John Motson told me this week, ‘but Ronnie Radford’s goal changed my life. I was effectively on trial in television and, to tell you the truth, I am not sure I had pulled up too many trees up to that point. ‘The match was meant to be a formality, which is why I was given it, but it changed into an unforgettable national occasion. ‘I watched it later with fish and chips at (Hereford striker) Billy Meadows’s house.’ Ronnie Radford’s famous goal against Newcastle in the FA Cup changed John Motson's life . ‘What a goal, what a goal,’ exclaimed Motson. ‘Radford the scorer. Ronnie Radford.’ The hero, wearing No 11, reeled away, both hands in the air. Boys in green parkas and grown men waving black-and-white scarves flooded on to the muddy turf, where, in extra time, substitute Ricky George hit Hereford’s winner low into the far corner. The Southern League no-hopers had done it. Colin Addison, player-manager in 1972, still brings that team together for reunions. ‘They say I’m their No 13,’ jokes Motson. Hereford fans invade the pitch after a famous Cup victory for the ages against Newcastle . Hereford goalscorers Ricky George (right) and Ronnie Radford (left) beam after the game . Three years ago on the 40th anniversary of the historic win, the FA Cup was brought to Hereford and paraded through the city. Pictures of the reunited team, complete with Motson wearing a shin-length sheepskin coat, are displayed in a glass cabinet in the Green Dragon Hotel foyer. Radford, a carpenter who has retired to his native Yorkshire, returns to Hereford occasionally. ‘Every time the response is absolutely fantastic — the same today as it was then,’ he said. ‘The supporters feel it as much as the players because they were as much part of it as we were. We couldn’t have done it without them. ‘It will never be forgotten. Giantkilling, from a long time back to a long time to come, is what the FA Cup is all about.’ Colin Addison (centre) still brings the Hereford team together for reunions . Radford points out that the 1972 win over Newcastle in a third-round replay was only one of many glorious FA Cup moments in tiny Hereford’s history. They have since beaten West Ham, drawn with Arsenal and Tottenham and lost narrowly to Leicester City, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United. Hereford were already making history back in 1952. Their 0-0 draw with London amateurs Leyton was reputedly the first FA Cup game, other than the final, to be broadcast live. Radford has watched spellbound the FA Cup feats of Warrington Town and Cambridge United this season. It is all part of the romance of world football’s oldest knockout competition, an institution which the late Geoffrey Green, of The Times, said, was ‘the spark that set the whole bonfire of football alight.’","Ronnie Radford's goal against Newcastle helped launch career of legendary football commentator John Motson .

"For years, our continental neighbours have been applauded as chic, slim and poised - all achieved seemingly without effort. Even more infuriatingly, French women appear to be able to maintain their slender elegance through everything from pregnancy to old age. But according to one Parisienne, getting the Gallic look isn't as effortless as it appears, with pressure to be thin causing some women to resort to extreme measures in a bid to remain slim. What's her secret? Actress Charlotte Gainsbourg defines the glamorised perception of the French woman . Speaking to the BBC, 50-year-old Isabelle said: 'If you are fat, you will not get that job. But if you have the silhouette - chic, ultra-slim, elegant - you are more or less made.' The Parisian art gallery director, who confesses that she's far from slim, says she enjoys being the exception to the rule - but maintains that she can only get away with it because she is self-employed. She explains that being 'fat' makes her feel free but reveals she struggles to find clothes to fit her in French shops. So how do the rest of the population do it? According to journalist Peggy Frey, it's all down to an intense, if hidden, regime. Writing in Le Figaro, Frey . revealed that French women would 'rather die than reveal their . beauty secrets'. Chic: Charlotte Gainsbourg (L) and star of Coco Before Chanel, Audrey Tautou (R), epitomise French chic . She also alleged that they scour hairdressers for the best colourist to give them a 'natural' looking hue, and invest in super strong anti-wrinkle creams from the tender age of 25. She added: 'They may never talk . about dieting, but that doesn't mean they don't watch what they eat. 'After all, you can't gorge on buttered baguettes all day and magically . maintain a size eight figure', and revealed that almost half smoke cigarettes, known to suppress the appetite, in a bid to stay slim. It has even been said, according to BBC reports, that the average French women feels the need to lose at least 2kg (4.4lbs) to fit in. Cashing in on this is the French slimming industry, which is booming with diet pills packed onto pharmacy shelves and slimming tips filling the pages of glossy magazines. And it has had a chilling impact on the psyche of French women, with Sonia Feertchak, editor-in-chief of . L'Encyclo des Filles, a popular guide to health and beauty for teenage . girls, concluding that French women 'daren't' grow fat. She hasn't aged a day! French model Carla Bruni pictured (L) in 1999 and (R) this year is clearly the holder of France's best kept secrets . 'Some will even starve themselves because in this society to be a fat female is to be a failure,' she explained. 'Fat women are seen as stupid. Their lives must be out-of-control, they are judged ugly, weird losers.' Sophia Thomas, a 25-year-old Briton who spent four years studying in France, added: 'Everywhere you look in Paris, there are beautiful, slim women. 'Whether it is on fashion billboards or just across the street, you can't escape that supposed perfection. 'Everybody aspires to be some sort of Coco Chanel. She was the epitome of high octane glamour with that perfect rouge pout, peachy cheeks, Breton stripes and flowing pearls. 'It's tough, especially when there are boulangeries on every corner. However, it seems that it's going to take years to shake off that glamourised view of French women, so I guess I'll be passing on that croissant and hot chocolate!' FRENCH WOMEN DON'T GET FAT .

Author Mireille Guiliano claims that while . they don’t forbid themselves anything, they eat it in moderation.

"Millions of Indonesians have watched on television exactly how Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will be executed on 'Death Island'. Chilling video has emerged of the mobile paramilitary brigade called Brimob in firing practice ahead of the last round of executions on Nusa Kambangan, where Chan and Sukumaran are due to be shifted 72 hours ahead of their deaths by firing squad. This comes as coffins arrived at a Christian Church in Cilacap, the nearest port to Nusa Kambangan, where a local Indonesian caretaker was pictured preparing four caskets in preparation for the executions. Scroll down for video . Hooded figure: Indonesia's Channel 1 recreated the method of execution by firing squad which was used to kill six foreigners on Nusa Kambangan last month using the hooded figure (pictured) to represent the prisoner. It is the same method that will be used on Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Target practice: These members of the Brimob paramilitary group practice firing at targets ahead of last months execution on 'Death Island'. The same group will carry out the executions of Chan and Sukumaran . Local Indonesian caretaker Suhendro Putro  prepares four caskets allocated to the scheduled executions on Nusa Kambangan, known as 'Death Island' More coffins are understood to be on their way to the pictured Christian Church in Cilacap, the nearest port to 'Death Island' Bali Police Chief A.J. Benny Mokalu on Wednesday confirmed the procedures that will lead to the executions. The condemned Australian pair would be taken from Bali's Kerobokan prison to Ngurah Rai airport during the night and flown 900 kilometres west to Cilacap, in central Java, then transferred by boat to Nusa Kambangan. Exactly when this will take place is still unknown. Indonesian officials have repeatedly rejected appeals from the condemned men's lawyers and the Australian government to stay the executions of Chan and Sukumaran, who were convicted on heroin trafficking charges in 2006. The footage of the execution practice round was aired on television on January 17 to demonstrate to Indonesian viewers just what would take place when five foreign drug traffickers were executed the following day. Those executions, of nationals from Brazill, the Netherlands, Malawi, Vietnam and one Indonesian, were the first since President Joko Widodo came to power last October. A tough stance on drug criminals was part of his campaign, and he has been uncompromising about using the death penalty despite pleas from foreign governments and rights activists. The video shows  the Brimob executioners dressed in military fatigues with semi-automatic rifles aiming loud volleys of fire repeatedly at bullseye targets. Even more horrifying is the spooky step-by-step recreation by Channel 1 Indonesia of the execution, using a white figure with its arms tied behind the back and a black hood over its head to represent the condemned man. Bali's Police Chief A.J. Benny Mokalu confirmed on Wednesday the condemned pair Sukumaran (left) and Chan (right) will be taken from Kerobokan prison to Ngurah Rai airport during the night and flown 900km west to Cilacap in central Java and transferred by boat to Nusa Kambangan . Death men: This eerie recreation of how the firing squad, which Channel 1 Indonesia represented with nine scary looking robotic figures, lines up to carry out the execution . The wives of convicted Indonesian terrorists imprisoned on the island where Australians Chan and Sukumaran are due to be executed visited their husbands the facility this week . The mobile paramilitary brigade, Brimob, who will execute the two Australians is pictured in firing practice last month before they executed five foreign drug traffickers on Nusa Kambangan Island . In the recreation, the firing squad is represented by a row of toy or robotic looking figures. The television report also lists a 27 point manifesto about how the execution will proceed, including the execution 'commander' raising a sword 'as a symbol for the firing squad to aim at the heart of the convict'. Points 24 and 25 give specific instructions for doctors to check the condition of the convict immediately after the shooting, 'and if the doctor thinks that the convict is still showing signs of life ... the firing squad commander must put a pistol to the temple just above the ear of the convict' and finish the job. Some of the last words the men being executed will hear are 'laksanakan, laksanakan' - meaning 'execute, execute' in Indonesian - shouted by the firing squad commander before three live rounds and nine blanks are loaded into the twelve rifles of the firing squad shooters. Part of the process includes clergy attending to 'give offenders a last chance to calm down for a maximum of three minutes' before they are shot. Brimob's snipers reload their rifles before continuing their target practice in a loud volley of fire . The shooters accurately aimed at the bullseye targets on the firing range in Java, Indonesia .

There are five different jumpers available. Two of the pullovers display a roaring log fire while another has a cat wearing a Christmas hat blinking and moving its mouth. A different design has a snow globe with a blizzard inside and the final jumper shows a creepy Father Christmas. The jumpers cost between £34.95 and £39.95 and are available from the Digital Dudz website. They have also available at Asda this weekend for £16. Mr Rober, from Los Angeles, uploaded a series of videos of the jumpers in action to his YouTube channel and thousands of people have already viewed them. Festive: The jumper pictured has a cosy log-fire scene but others in the range include a snowing snow globe and a creepy Father Christmas . 'Two years ago I released a video of my Halloween costume on YouTube where I used two iPads and a FaceTime chat to blow a hole in my body,' he said. 'It went viral and led me to create the company Digital Dudz. The company has done pretty well and six months ago I actually quit my job at Nasa. 'Nasa was awesome, it is such a great atmosphere. Everyone is so bright and engaged in working together to accomplish really difficult and really cool tasks. 'But at the core, I'm still building really cool stuff that people have never seen before,' he added. Mr Rober said he has had a really good reaction to the new jumper designs, including over 25,000 views of the YouTube video showcasing the designs, which he released on Monday. He said: 'My favourite is the creepy Santa one - I really like it. It's the creepy factor is subtle until you really look at it. 'Nothing is as cool as building spaceships but there is something satisfying with getting an email from a customer that says ""I've never given as many high fives as I did last night wearing your shirt.""' Sales of Christmas jumpers have soared 200 per cent at George at Asda, which is selling Mr Rober's jumpers. The retailer said £3 million worth of Christmas jumpers have been sold this week alone and 82 per cent of customers revealed they would be wearing one on Christmas day. Around 42 per cent of people said they plan on buying festive knits as gifts this year.

"It sounds like a dream - an island just a few metres off the coast of Posilipo, Naples, surrounded by crystal clear waters, with gorgeous views, winding lanes and a majestic villa. Isola La Gaiola is so close to the shore that it can be swum to easily from the mainland. But its narrow streets are strangely silent - the island rarely gets visitors as it is reputed to be cursed and those who have lived there have met with a terrible fate. Some of the island's unlucky owners faced economic ruin and tales of murders, drownings and suicide abound . Isola La Gaiola is in fact  two islands which are connected by a fragile stone bridge . Some of the island's unlucky owners faced economic ruin and tales of murders, drownings and suicide. The string of bad luck started towards the end of the late 19th century when the island's first owner Luigi de Negri was struck with financial ruin after his fish farm business failed. The run of bad luck continued in 1920s when owner Hans Braun was murdered and his wife drowned in the sea.

"'Miss! The volcano, it’s erupting!' The voice of our waiter interrupts the near stupor my mouthful of pasta alla Norma has induced as he rushes to our table. Clutching my glass of red wine harvested on the slopes of Mount Etna – the very volcano that is spitting out fiery bursts of orange lava in the distance - I rush over to the terrace to watch the spectacle. There is no need to be alarmed. Minor eruptions are common (a far more impressive eruption will occur just days after our visit), and locals of the Sicilian town of Taormina barely raise an eyebrow. Smoking at sunrise: Mount Etna looms over the town of Taormina in Sicily at dawn . 'The Monte Carlo of Sicily': The town has attracted royalty and nobility over the years, as well as celebrities including Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Redford, Cary Grant, and Audrey Hepburn . Given my amazement upon hearing that they often wake to find the hotel terrace covered in a light dusting of volcanic ash, our waiter knew I’d not want to miss seeing the eruption with my own eyes. Alas, my eyes aren’t co-operating, being hopelessly short-sighted. Within moments, another waiter appears at my elbow, flourishing a tray of spectacles of varying prescriptions. Such is the service at this grand establishment. As the first hotel in Taormina, Grand Hotel Timeo has an illustrious history welcoming royalty, film stars and notable figures since its opening in 1874. The panoramic hotel terrace is the place to be seen during the annual film festival. Past attendees have included Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Redford, Cary Grant, Tom Cruise, Audrey Hepburn and Robert DeNiro. Every June, the picturesque resort town transforms into a mini Cannes. Indeed, Taormina has been likened to the Monte Carlo of Sicily. Truman Capote spent time working from a villa in town in 1951. The beautiful surroundings are even said to have inspired the inception of Lady Chatterley’s Lover during D.H. Lawrence’s two-year residency in the 1920s. Picturesque: From the volcano to the beautiful coastline, Taormina enjoys postcard perfect views . Pool with a view: The infinity pool at Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea in Mazzaro Bay overlooks the beach . Colourful streets lined with designer boutiques open onto piazzas crowded with well-heeled holidaymakers. Vibrant Bougainvillea tumbles from windowsills and music trickles out of every restaurant. A cable car ride down the steep hill will find the pebbly beaches, crammed in the height of summer with sun loungers adorned with beautiful bronzed bodies. Super yachts clutter the horizon, while smaller vessels ferry tourists in and out of the Blue Grotto caves. Wonderful hikes up the hillside with views of the glittering Ionian Sea help to work off the decadent Sicilian cuisine. The local breakfast is Granita – what we would perceive as dessert at home, but here it seems perfectly reasonable to start the day with an icy treat topped with cream and mopped up with sweet Brioche bread. History: The ancient Greek Theatre above the town centre holds al fresco concerts in the summer months . By the seaside: Crystal clear water and Blue Grottos create a playground for tourists and day trippers . I make it my duty to sample every variation I can find of the aforementioned local specialty, pasta alla Norma - made with fried eggplant, tomatoes, basil and ricotta cheese. Every meal is finished with cannoli or cassata, a delicious cake topped with a peculiar neon green icing. Mount Etna looms over the town in the distance, a constant presence, and lazily puffs smoke in our direction for the duration of our visit. She is at her most spectacular at dawn, bathed in an inky purple light. We are struck by how many fellow visitors we meet reveal that this is their fifth - or fifteenth - holiday here. There is something special about Taormina; some magic that draws back visitors again and again. Luxury: Private hotel beaches cater to your every whim . Perhaps it’s the undeniably romantic setting (we witness a handful of weddings taking place across a few days). Or the thrilling beauty of a medieval town on the doorstep of a volatile volcano. It could be the Sicilian hospitality. Or dessert for breakfast. Whatever the reason, I’m under Taormina’s spell. Where to stay . Grand Hotel Timeo boasts the best location in Taormina, nestled below the ancient Teatro Greco, enjoying magnificent views of the sea and Mount Etna. Service at the Timeo is unparalleled. From pool attendants that offer to settle me at a better sun lounger the moment a hint of shadow threatens to intervene on my tanning efforts to a complimentary boat excursion for hotel guests. The glamorous pool is straight out of the 1950s, complete with a vintage ice cream cart, and guests also have use of the private beach and infinity pool at the Timeo’s equally luxurious sister hotel Villa Sant’Andrea. Classic elegance: The glamorous Belmond Grand Hotel Timeo is the place to be seen during the annual film festival . Timeless: As the oldest established hotel in Taormina, the Grand Hotel Timeo excels with its unrivalled views, impeccable service and elegant suites . Where to eat . Maffei’s, just off bustling Corso Umberto, is a charming, romantic garden restaurant with warm, friendly service and fantastic seafood. Where to drink . If you’re looking for nightlife, Morgana is the spot to be seen at. The open-air bar heaves in the summer months, so get there early to nab a table. Ancient: Teatro Greco enjoys spectacular views across the sea and Mount Etna . What to see . Teatro Greco: The ancient Greek Theatre, located on Via Teatro Greco, offers magical views of Mount Etna from the amphitheatre. To walk around the theatre in peace, arrive between 9-10am, before the tour groups. Better yet, book a ticket to one of the summer concerts that take place in the evenings throughout July and August. Madonna della Rocca: Hike up to the beautiful church atop the cliff to take in panoramic views of Taormina from above. Worth the walk up: For energetic tourists, a hike up to Madonna della Rocca will be rewarded with panoramic vistas . Mount Etna: Day trips to Europe’s most active and highest volcano are available through several tour companies. At over 3000 metres above sea level, the temperature at the top is brisk – the volcano is transformed into a ski resort in the winter months. Isola Bella: Once privately owned, the small island jutting out into the bay is now a nature reserve, accessible by a narrow pathway from the beach.

"The view of the Eiffel Tower against the Paris skyline is breathtaking on an ordinary day, but the French capital was recently bathed in a rare horizontal rainbow. Across the city's horizon a clear spectrum of colours emerged for a short time, in a natural phenomenon known as a fire rainbow. Parisian Bertrand Kulik, 33, spotted the unusual display out of the window of his apartment in France's capital on March 17. A horizontal rainbow, known as a fire rainbow, is pictured above the Paris skyline by Parisian Bertrand Kulik . Horizontal rainbows, or circumhorizon arcs, occur when cirrus clouds are elevated enough to form plate-shaped ice crystals . Amateur photographer Mr Kulik said: . ‘I have never seen a rainbow like that before. This light phenomenon . looked like a rising aurora over Paris. 'When I saw it, I had to react . very fast. I was very impressed by this beauty and I knew that I could . not miss it.’ The display was only visible for a short time, but Mr Kulik quickly grabbed his camera and captured the rare sight. Fire rainbows are a common sight in the U.S. but are rarer in northern Europe because the sun is not often at the right angle to create the effect . The horizontal rainbow was brought on by heavy rainstorms abd stormy weather that lashed Paris last week . He . added: ‘It was only possible to see it for few minutes. Often I am . waiting to catch some weather pictures. Every day I hope to see some . atmospheric phenomenons like that. ‘The day was tormented with a stormy sky. Even in a big city it's possible to see some amazing natural phenomenon. ‘It was a very turbulent day and I will remember it for a long time.’ The horizontal rainbow was brought on by heavy rainstorms that lashed Paris last week. Fire . rainbows, known by the proper name of circumhorizon arc, occur when . cirrus clouds are far enough up in the air to form plate-shaped ice . crystals. They are not actually rainbows, but a halo effect, although they are commonly referred to as fire rainbows. When the sun is at the right angle it hits the top of these . plates and splits into different colours that are viewable on the . ground. Although such fire rainbows are . relatively common in the United States, they are a rarer sight in . northern Europe where the sun less frequently has the required elevation . needed for it to occur. The effect only lasted for a few minutes so Bertrand Kulik acted quickly to capture the skyline vista .

"Iain Duncan Smith yesterday insisted . he would take ‘no bloody lessons’ from those calling for him to live on . £53 a week, saying he had been on the breadline twice. The Work and Pensions Secretary . accused Labour and the BBC of fuelling a ‘stunt’ after he suggested in a . radio interview that if necessary, he could get by on the amount a . benefit claimant said he had to subsist on. An online petition calling on Mr . Duncan Smith to live for a year on £53 a week, which has been seized on . by Labour MPs opposing cuts to the vast welfare budget, had last night . attracted almost 300,000 signatures. Iain Duncan Smith, seen here with his wife Betsy, insists he has lived on the breadline before . Back at work: David Bennett leaving home in Hunwick, County Durham, yesterday . But the minister insisted yesterday . that the Left had ‘lost the argument’ on reform of a welfare state that . kept people ‘trapped into dependency’ and was now trying to ‘set up a . stunt’. He said he would not agree to the . demands to show he could exist on the same income as market trader David . Bennett because he had ‘been there, done that’. ‘I’m not going take any lectures from . these people because the Left has opposed everything that we’ve done,’ Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail. ‘What’s going on here is a campaign . by the Left to distract from the reality of our changes. My personal . details are quite simple. When I came out of the Army I was unemployed. I . lived in a bedsit and I had to look for work. ‘I left the Army at 26, 27. I went off . and did a heavy goods vehicle drivers’ course. I know what it’s like to . live on a low income. ‘I didn’t claim unemployment benefit – . I lived off the savings I had – but I went to the job centre. Later on . in life when I worked my way up I was made redundant, I again had to . start all over again from scratch and this time I had kids. I didn’t . have any financial backing and I had to pick up the pieces, find another . job and get back to work. ‘The honest truth is I don’t need any . lessons from these people. I have worked hard all my life for what I’ve . achieved and nobody has given me a damn penny. My earnings are what I . live on.’ Mr Duncan Smith, who earns £134,000 a . year and lives in a £2million Tudor country house with wife Betsy, a . member of the aristocratic Fremantle family, said he had lost his job at . a property company when interest rates soared after Black Wednesday in . 1992. David Bennett, working on his market stall yesterday, challenged Iain Duncan Smith to live on £53 a week . ‘The company literally stopped working . and like a number of people I was made redundant. I was shocked, but I . had to go home and tell my wife that the wheels had come off the bus,’ he said. ‘It took about three months to find a . job. I picked up the paper every day, put a ring round all the job ads. I . went to the library, looked up the stock market yearbook, wrote blind . letters to people, used my Amstrad computer every day to look for work. Every bloody day I had to look for work. One of those blind letters got . me in to an interview. ‘So I don’t need any lessons from . people about living on a low income and making ends meet. I have done it . twice and I know what it’s like to have to been made unemployed and to . struggle. I’ve been there, done it. ‘I have never taken anything from . anybody else. I’m proud enough to believe I get on and make my own . bloody way in the world. I don’t believe in having anyone else do it for . me. ‘That’s why I want to reform the . system because it leaves people feeling helpless. This ridiculous . nonsense is a stunt, and it’s a stunt to avoid the reality that we . inherited a bust system – financially bust and morally bust.’ The Mail revealed yesterday that Mr . Bennett, who challenged Mr Duncan Smith to live on £53 a week, is a . regular gambler who lists his hobbies as ‘football, poker and beer’. Challenge: Market trader David Bennett, left, . asked Tory minister Iain Duncan Smith, right, if he could survive on the . new housing benefit level of £53 in a charged interview on Radio 4 . Iain Duncan-Smith's Buckinghamshire home. He is paid £1,581 a week but said he cwould be able to live on £7.57 per day if he had to . Tory MPs were furious the BBC allowed . him to confront the Work and Pensions Secretary apparently without . making the most cursory checks on his income, which is nearer £150 a . week. Conservative MP for Esher, Dominic . Raab, wrote to new BBC director-general Lord Hall, saying he was . concerned that the interview with Mr Bennett not only lacked accuracy . but ‘may well have failed in its duty of care towards Mr Bennett’. ‘What background checks were made by . the BBC to ensure the veracity of Mr Bennett’s claims?’ he asked. ‘Mr . Bennett claims that he “put a comment on [the BBC website] saying David . Cameron can stick his Big Society where the sun doesn’t shine”. Why did . the BBC not take this as an indication that his claims merited deeper . examination? ‘The BBC has persistently used highly politicised and partisan language in its coverage of the Government’s welfare reforms.’ Chancellor George Osborne said . yesterday: ‘I don’t think it’s sensible to reduce this debate to an . argument about one individual’s set of circumstances. ‘We have a welfare system where there . are actually lots of benefits available to people on very low incomes, . there’s jobseeker’s allowance, income support, working tax credit, . council tax benefit, housing benefit, if they have children, child tax . credit. ‘What this debate is about, it’s not . about any individual, it’s about creating a welfare system that rewards . work, supports people who do the right thing, helps people who want to . get on in life and has a regard for the many millions of people who work . hard and pay their taxes and expect them to be well spent.’ Mr Duncan Smith once stayed on a tough housing estate for a Channel 4 documentary.","Iain Duncan Smith was challenged to live on £53-a-week by benefits claimant David Bennett on Radio 4 .

"Jessica Ridgeway's family today heard horrifying details of how their 10-year-old daughter had her hair cut off and was strangled, sexually assaulted and dismembered by a teenager. Austin Sigg, 18, was emotionless as prosecutors pushed for consecutive sentences on all 15 convictions of Jessica's murder - but he broke down in tears after a video celebrating Jessica's life was played to the courtroom. Since he was 17 when he committed the crime, Sigg is exempt from the death penalty and eligible for parole after 40 years, but the other charges could add up to a life sentence. A psychologist told the court how Sigg was sexually aroused by dismembering the girl in a bath tub and lied to her about how she would see her mother again. Emotionless: Sentencing in the trial of Austin Sigg began today. Sigg plead guilty to raping and murdering 10-ear-old Jessica Ridgeway last year and may spend the rest of his life in prison . Jessica's disappearance on her way home from school caused panic among . parents across Denver, who feared their children were not safe . Expert witness Anna Salter said: 'There’s no logical motive for dismemberment other than sexual thrill.' She . also told how the teenager had no empathy for Jessica and calmly ate a . snack as he recounted the horrific details of his crime. He strangled her to death with his bare hands after his first attempt to do so with a zip tie failed. Sigg acted against the . advice of his defense team, and plead guilty to killing and dismembering . the fifth-grader after kidnapping her on her way to school on October . 5, 2012. According to pre-trial hearings, as . well as Sigg's own admissions to investigators made after his arrest, . there were plenty of warning signs indicating that the troubled mortuary . science student was on a dangerous path. At . age 16, Sigg has developed an obsession with hard-core child . pornography and spent a year watching violent videos depicting kids . being tortured and raped. Defense attorney Katherine Spengler told how Sigg's mother often inhaled paint in the late stages of her pregnancy and fell down the stairs once shortly before he was born. Spengler said Sigg was born with an abnormality in his intestines, and that his birth by vacuum extraction also caused him to have a head deformity. She said he had several surgeries before he turned 6. Killer: Sigg remained emotionless apart from a short period when he broke down in tears after a video celebrating Jessica's life was played to the court . In . May 2012, four months before the teen decided to fulfill some of his . sickening fantasies by kidnapping little Jessica on her way to school, . Sigg unsuccessfully tried to snatch a female jogger in Ketner Lake. Jessica was snatched off the street while walking to school, and her . disappearance panicked thousands of residents in Denver's western . suburbs. After Sigg pleaded guilty, the prosecution described how Sigg grabbed Jessica, pulled her . into his car and tied up her hands and feet. During her a short statement the girl's mother vowed to forget Sigg's name one she left the court room. Jessica, . a fifth-grader who loved purple and performing in a peewee cheerleading . squad, left home to walk to school in Westminster on October 5, 2012. She never made it there. Hundreds . of people helped search for her. Jessica's backpack was found two days . later in Superior, a town about six miles from her home. Days after . that, human remains later identified as Jessica's were found in a park. Authorities, . meanwhile, urged residents to watch for any suspicious changes in . neighbors' behavior. Officers guarded crosswalks and photographed cars . in the area. Horror: Police discovered Jessica's body in a field off of a highway on October 19, 2012. It had been severely dismembered by Sigg, who admitted he killed her . Parents . escorted their children to and from area schools. Mailboxes and trees . were encircled by ribbons in Jessica's favorite color, purple. On October 19, 2012, a resident . contacted authorities to alert them to Sigg because he reportedly had a . fascination with death, Westminster police Detective Luis Lopez . testified at a preliminary hearing. FBI agents took a DNA sample from . Sigg. On October 23, Sigg's mother, Mindy Sigg, called 911, saying her son wanted to confess. Investigators said Sigg told them some of Jessica's remains were hidden in a crawl space in his mother's home, where he lived. Painful: Jessica Ridgeway's mother Sarah Ridgeway left the courtroom earlier this month as prosecutors described the horrors committed against her daughter by Sigg . Somber mood: District attorney Peter Weir, second from right, and members of his staff leave the courtroom after Austin Sigg pleaded guilty to killing 10-year-old Jessica . Monster: Austin Sigg, 18, had spent a year watching violent child pornography depicting kids being raped and tortured before he kidnapped and butchered 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway last year . They . said Sigg described how he abducted Jessica as she walked past his car. He said he bound her arms and her legs, drove around for a little bit, . then took her to his house. There, he told investigators, Sigg . tried to strangle the girl and then used his hands to kill her. He also . allegedly told investigators that he dismembered Jessica in a bathtub. Lopez said Sigg's DNA was found on Jessica's clothing. Sigg . dropped out of high school after the 11th grade and later earned a GED. Former classmates say he was intelligent but complained about school . and was bullied for having a high voice. When . asked about his criminal record on the 911 call, Sigg told the . dispatcher: 'The only other thing that I have done was the Ketner Lake . incident where the woman got attacked. That was me.' In . the attack on the jogger, investigator Michael Lynch testified that . Sigg used homemade chloroform to attempt to subdue the woman. She . escaped.","Court heard how Austin Sigg was aroused by dismembering 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway in a bathtub .

"Michael Beaumont claimed his son Kadan had been fatally injured by the family dog but he was found guilty of murder today . A father who claimed the family dog killed his 11-month-old son has been found guilty of murder today. Michael Beaumont, 29, claimed Kadan had been knocked over by his Staffordshire Bull Terrier and even sent pictures of his son's injuries to his girlfriend and the child's mother, Helen Barnes. But prosecutors at Sheffield Crown Court said this was a story he made up to disguise the horrific injuries he had inflicted. Part-time gardener Beaumont, from . Hoyland, near Barnsley, claimed the dog, called Mia, had 'flipped over' Kadan before banging his head on some garden steps. In the message to 28-year-old Barnes, he wrote: 'Look at my head mummy. Naughty Mia knocked me down the steps in the garden. 'I cut my neck as well. Don't worry, daddy chased her round the garden and slapped her.' The jury was told how emergency services . were called to the family home on September 28, 2011, following reports . that the baby had been unwell after being knocked over by the dog the . day before. Kadan was taken to Barnsley District General Hospital and later transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital where he died. Pathologists later found 34 different injuries on Kadan’s body and said he died as a result of a heavy impact to his head. Kadan’s mother, teaching assistant Helen Barnes, 28, was found guilty of neglect and wept in the dock when the verdict was announced. A neighbour who saw Kadan after the alleged dog incident said he 'looked as though he had been beaten up by Mike Tyson' but no medical attention was sought until an ambulance was called the next day. Doctors found he had two recent fractures of the skull, bleeding in his eyes and on the surface of the brain as well as multiple bruises to his head and face. Beaumont and Barnes will be sentenced tomorrow at Sheffield Crown Court by Mr Justice Globe. Detective . Chief Inspector Sean Middleton, who led the investigation, said: 'This . is a shocking case of violence from a parent, which sadly resulted in . the death of an innocent young child. Beaumont, 28, (pictured outside court) sent a picture of Kadan's injuries to the baby's mother Helen Barnes (right). She has been found guilty of neglect and both will be sentenced tomorrow . 'By blaming the family dog, Beaumont attempted to cover his horrific actions, but the evidence surrounding the cause of Kadan’s death, provided by expert pathologists, was overwhelming. 'Beaumont claimed that Kadan had been knocked over by the dog the day before, however, experts concluded that Kadan had died from head injuries that were likely to have been sustained only an hour before emergency services were called. 'This has been a particularly distressing case for all concerned and hopefully the end of this trial will bring some closure to the rest of Kadan’s family. 'I would like to thank the community of Hoyland for their help and support during this investigation.'","Michael Beaumont said Staffordshire Bull Terrier had knocked over Kadan .

"Realtors say that thousands of wealthy Chinese are buying up California housing stock in cash (file picture) California house building is on the increase as Chinese buyers look to invest in vast sums of money in property abroad. Experts say that for many buyers money is not an issue and property is being bought for up to $1.5million in cash. House builders are even using Feng Shui in their designs to suit the Chinese market. Architects are also making plans to accommodating more than two generations of a family. Realtors say Asian families are attracted . to the state by the quality of education and the potential for price . growth on the homes. Property investments account for 14 per cent of China's total GDP with real estate and construction a major driving force in the world's second largest economy. Many wealthy Chinese people are looking to invest abroad as the housing boom in the country spirals. Kinney Yong, of RE/MAX Premier Realty, told NBC: 'They see the market here still has room for appreciation. What's driving them over here is that they have this cash, and they want to park it somewhere or invest somewhere.' Companies such as Lennar, Pulte, K Hovnanian and Ryland are buoyant are a difficult time during the housing crash. According to NBC, 20,000 turned up to look at the plans and model homes of the Great Park Neighborhood, in Orange County. Most of those thinking about investing in one of the 5,000 planned homes were Asian. Emile Haddad, chief executive of . Fivepoint Communities, which is developing the Great Park Neighborhood, . told NBC: 'We are seeing a lot of Asians who are buying as an . investment, but their kids are going to school here, so kids live in the . home.'

This year, the government gave virtually no warning before a mandatory 20 per cent tax was introduced on homes, sparking panic among owners. After the Chinese government gave citizens the right to buy their own homes in 1998, the middle classes invested heavily in the property market, primarily because there was nowhere else to put their money. The result was a massive housing boom and although official statistics vary wildly, some economists claim that in the capital Beijing, prices rose by a staggering 250 per cent between 2006 and 2010.","Realtors say Chinese investors buying properties worth up to £1.5m in cash .

"James Arthur Ray, pictured during his trial, said yesterday he wishes he could trade places with three people killed in sweat lodge at a retreat he led . A self-help author who led an Arizona sweat lodge that left three people dead said he wishes he could trade places with the victims. James Arthur Ray was convicted on three counts of negligent homicide and served 20 months in prison until his release in July this year. In his first interview since being freed he said he haunted by what happened. The deaths occurred in 2009 after dozens of people traveled to a scenic retreat outside Sedona, Arizona, for his five-day 'Spiritual Warrior' event in which participants endured fasts and sleep-deprivation. Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee died in the sweat lodge, which consisted of trees covered with tarpaulins and blankets over hot coals . Liz Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, slipped into a coma and died after more than a week in the hospital. Eighteen others were injured suffering from ailments including burns, dehydration, breathing problems, kidney failure, or elevated body temperature. Ray told CNN's Piers Morgan yesterday: 'If I could trade places with any of the three, James Kirby or Liz, I would do it.' Ray made millions from his self-help business and as a motivational speaker and appeared on Larry King Live. He says he has lost his fortune but insists 'hurting' people he had tried to help is more difficult. He told CNN: 'It's just the antithesis of anything that I had ever stood for or wanted. And so that anguish has continued every single day since that moment.' A further 18 people were injured in the sweat lodge that can be seen on the bottom left of this shot of the Angel Valley Retreat Center, near Sedona, Arizona . Kirby Brown (left) and James . Shore (right, with wife Alyssa)  both died in the two-hour sweat . lodge ceremony . Participants paid more than $9,000 each to attend the retreat and the sweat lodge was planned as the highlight. Ray acknowledged he was responsible for the deaths, but offered no excuses for his lack of action as the chaos unfolded at the sweat lodge. Liz Neuman, 49, fell into a coma and died in hospital a week after the ceremony . He and his attorneys maintained that he wasn't aware people were dying or in distress, or he would have stopped the ceremony. Survivors said people were vomiting and lying unconscious on the ground. The families of victims have spoken openly against Ray ever rebuilding his self-help business. Ms Neuman's daughter Andrea Puckett previously said: ''Ideally, we don't want [Ray] doing anything in the industry anymore. 'I don't think he has the right to work with people. If he does move forward with that, I hope people become aware of what he did and he changes the way that he handles his seminars and his teachings.' He has said he will not conduct a sweat lodge again but since his release has set up another self-help blog. The self-described 'thought leader' wrote: 'The last four years of my life have been the most painful and difficult of my entire existence; and yet they’ve also been an incredible and amazing adventure. 'Sometimes you must experience something completely ugly to find the beautiful.'","James Arthur Ray served 20 months in prison for negligent homicide .

"A French right-wing historian shot himself dead yesterday in front of hundreds of tourists at the altar of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris in protest at the introduction of gay marriage in France. Dominique Venner, 78, is said to have walked calmly past the crowds before taking out an automatic pistol and shooting himself in the head. It came three days after President Francois Hollande signed gay marriage into law despite the issue proving hugely controversial. Dominique Venner, an historian, shot himself dead in front of the altar of Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral, according to French media reports, reportedly in protest at moves to allow gay people to marry in France . Some 1,500 tourists were cleared from the 12th-century cathedral after the shooting at around 4pm. ‘There was screaming and lots of . shouting following a loud bang,’ said one witness. ‘People began to run . out in panic.’ Mr Venner had written on his blog in the hours before his . death denouncing the ‘infamous law’. He also placed a letter on the . altar. The historian was a former member of . the paramilitary Secret Army Organisation which fought against France . giving up Algeria as a colony in 1962. Militant: Mr Venner was a member of a paramilitary group opposing Algeria becoming independent from France . Mr Venner, who was awarded a . prestigious prize by l'Académie française for one of his historical . works,  was a former member of the Secret Army Organisation (OAS), the . paramilitary group which fought against France giving up Algeria as a . colony. He was . jailed for 18 months in La Santé Prison as a political undesirable for . his role in the ultra-national organisation and was freed in 1962. A report by Europe 1 radio station reads: 'According to our information, he is Dominique Venner, essayist and former member of the OAS who was close to the anti-gay marriage movement.' The Cathedral was full of visitors when the horrific incident took place, at around 4pm. 'There was screaming and lot so shouting following a loud bang,' said one witness. 'People were naturally very scared and began to run out in panic. 'Police and other emergency workers including firemen got here very quickly, and then the whole cathedral was evacuated.' An unidentified police source said Mr Venner carried a letter on his person but made no declaration before shooting himself dead in the mid-afternoon, reports Reuters. Notre Dame, which dates back to the 12th Century, has become a battleground for those fighting over homosexual marriage, with demonstrations regularly held around it. Mr Venner, an ultra-right wing . Catholic, was known to be extremely angry when a law allowing gay . marriage across France was finally given the seal of approval earlier . this month. According to the International Business Times, Venner wrote: 'The demonstrators of May 26 [against the law allowing gay marriage in France] will be right to shout their impatience and rage. A law steeped in infamy, once voted, can always be voided.' Icon: The cathedral welcomes 13 million visitors a year . Bystanders: The cathedral was full of people who saw the horrific suicide take place . Last week . another male pensioner pensioner walked into the foyer of a nursery in . Paris and blasted himself to death with a sawn-off shotgun in front of . children. Around a dozen pupils - some as young as five - and one teacher at the private school close to the Eiffel Tower witnessed the horrific events. 'I thought there were terrorists who had guns and were coming into the school. Then I saw the man on the ground with a lot of blood,' said one five-year-old witness. Many of those who witnessed today's carnage were expected to be treated by psychiatrists specialising in sudden trauma. The chaotic scenes last week as parents come to get their children at the nursery school where a man committed suicide in front of pupils . Notre Dame has seen a number of suicides in its long history, but most of them have been people who jumped from the towers. This year the cathedral got new bells as part of celebrations marking 850 years since construction on the cathedral began. Regularly scheduled guided visits of the world-famous gothic cathedral were taking place at the time of the incident, according to the church’s website.

"Belgian politicians will vote today on plans to extend euthanasia to extremely sick children with their parents' consent. If they back the proposed new bill, Belgium will be a step closer to becoming the first country to remove the age limit for euthanasia. However, it would insist that parents have a role in their child's decision to die. Belgian politicians will vote today on whether to back plans to remove the age limit for euthanasia (file picture) Jean-Jacques De Gucht, from the . Flemish liberals, who form part of the ruling coalition, said: 'We want . to provide the freedom of choice, also to minors who are able to make up . their own mind.' Today's . senate panel will vote whether to support the bill allowing the killing . of a young patient suffering from an extreme condition, and pass the . legislation on to parliament. The committee will not have the power to make the bill law. But . the panel's backing would be an important move in that direction as the . committee shares the same political makeup as the broader parliament. Backers . say the law would give a merciful way out for youngsters suffering from . debilitating conditions, and legalise a practice that they say is . already going on in secret. 'Imagine . a cancer or leukaemia patient, a child whom we have already treated for . eight years and in which we reach a stage where we know there is . nothing more that we can do to cure him,' said Marc Cosyns, lecturer of . medical ethics at Ghent University. Opponents to the plans say it will open the door to infanticide and argue children are too young to make such a decision . Opponents say it would open the door to infanticide and leave the ultimate decision in the hands of someone too young to make it. Euthanasia is outlawed altogether in most countries. 'Once the possibility for euthanasia exists for children, demand is likely to rise. It's clear among adults that it is difficult to keep euthanasia within limits once the taboo of killing has fallen,' said oncologist Benoit Beuselinck, founder of euthanasiestop.be. Some religious groups have also come out against the legislation. Belgium's . neighbour the Netherlands already lets terminally ill children seek . euthanasia. But the age limit is 12, and anyone aged up to 16 has to get . full parental consent. Analysts . said there was a good chance the bill would get backing from the . senate's joint justice and social affairs panel, as it had already been . proposed by members of the Flemish and Walloon arms of the coalitions . liberal and socialist parties. The . third coalition partner, the Christian Democrats, has acknowledged . there is a broad political consensus to extend euthanasia to minors, but . is pushing for a minimum age limit of 15 and tighter rules on medical . panels reviewing euthanasia requests. 'In matters of life and death it is no mistake to think a bit longer about the law we are creating,' said senator Els Van Hoof, of the Flemish Christian Democrats. The proposed law already says children choosing to die would have to be of 'sound mind and judgement', effectively ruling out infants. Dutch data suggest youngsters make up just a tiny fraction of people seeking euthanasia. Only five minors requested it between 2002 and 2013, only one of them under 16. Belgium is already seen as one of the world's most liberal countries when it comes to euthanasia, and allows it for people who are not terminally ill .","Senate panel will vote on plans to remove age limit for euthanasia .

"While millions of us may dream of a few days in the Mediterranean heat, the reality is that we like our weather a little more on the mild side. Researchers have found that the average Briton's ideal summer temperature is a moderately warm 23.5C (74F) – so today's weather should keep most of us happy.

A . spokesman for online discount shopping site PromotionalCodes.org.uk, which . commissioned the poll, said: 'One of our favourite pastimes as a nation . is to moan about the weather no matter how hot or cold it is. 'For many, it is either too wet or too dry so it was interesting to find a temperature which everyone would be happy with. 'It seems most people are content with a temperature of 74 F (23 degrees C), it's by no means cold but it is not stifling hot either.' One male respondent said: 'For me, it isn't summer unless it's baking hot, well over 86 degrees F (30 degrees C). It's a pity we rarely see that in the UK.' A woman respondent added: 'I think a temperature in the mid-twenties is just right, not too hot and not too cold. It is just a shame we hardly get to see it between the constant spells of rain. 'It can be really awful when the weather is too hot. It gets to the point where you can't do anything.' As Britain bathes in the mini heatwave, it's not just humans that are having a hoot. These owls and even a hedgehog took the opportunity to enjoy the good weather in the bluebells. The pictures of the tawny and long-eared owls were taken at the British Wildlife Centre in Surrey. Head keeper and photographer Matt Binstead said: 'I just happened to be there at the right time for these ones. 'After the miserable spring we've had, you can sense that even the birds and animals appreciate a bit of good weather.' From owl chicks and fox cubs to rare . wildcat kittens, the British Wildlife Centre has helped to rear some of . Britains's most iconic and shy species. The BWC is Britain's only native . wildlife centre, housing more than 50 species of British animal from . adders and field mice to red squirrels, weasels and wildcats. Mr Binstead said: 'As far as I am aware we are the only centre in the country that has 100 per cent British wildlife. 'The Centre mainly consists of large very natural enclosures with only what you would find for the animals in the wild. 'We currently have more than 50 . species of British animals here and what we do have is one of every .

"Two people are believed to have been killed after a crane collapsed at the Brazilian football stadium due to host the opening match at next year's World Cup. The final part of the structure, which was due to be one of the centerpieces of the 2014 tournament,  was being installed at the Corinthians stadium when the 500-ton crane cut through the roof of the east side stand, causing extensive damage. One of the dead workers, 42-year-old Fabio Luis Pereira, was inside a truck when it was hit by the falling metal structure. The other, 44-year-old Ronaldo Oliveira dos Santos, was said to be 'napping' during a break in an area that was supposed to have been cleared. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Firefighters recover the body of a worker who was killed when the crane collapsed . Three people have been killed after the Itaquerao Stadium, which is due to host the opening match at next year's World Cup, partially collapsed in Sao Paulo . People stand in front of a metal structure that buckled on part of the stand . Aftermath: There are fears the death toll could rise as emergency services and construction workers try and clear the area . The accident happened at lunchtime, so few of the nearly 1,700 workers were on the site when the crane collapsed. A stonemason who was off at a cafeteria said it was lucky the accident happened when it did. Evadro Pereira, 32, said: 'If it hadn't been lunchtime there would have been many more deaths. It was really very scary.' Already, public prosecutors and a workers union in Sao Paulo were demanding an investigation into conditions at the venue, saying work shouldn't resume until authorities deem the stadium safe. None of the employees will be returning to the site for the next three days during a mourning period. FIFA president Sepp Blatter has said he is 'deeply saddened' by reports of deaths. He added in the statement on Twitter: 'Our heartfelt condolences are with the families.' Television footage showed the twisted metal structure on the ground amid heavy debris. The enormous crane can be seen crushed against a large portion of the stands in pictures taken from the air. A LED panel installed outside the venue was also hit. Cranes were lifting large parts of the . roof onto the stand throughout the morning and collapsed when the last . module was being installed. A . joint statement from the construction company Odebrecht and Corinthians . said the procedure had been completed 38 times before and similar work . had been done on the rest of the site in the weeks prior. Nearly complete: The last metal girder was being lifted into place above the stand before it cut through the roof . Response: Fire crews attend the scene surrounded by fallen metal structures . Crushed: A close up of the roof highlights the extent of the damage caused by the falling machine . It added that the grandstand had not been compromised, an early suggestion the damage could be repaired. The construction site's manager Frederico Barbosa said the structure of the site had been 'little affected.' He added: 'Everything was being done according to procedure, the construction site's manager. 'We will have to wait for the investigation to find out what caused the crane to collapse.' He said that around 30 percent of the stadium will be closed off pending authorities' investigations. View: An aerial shot of the Sao Paulo stadium after the tragic accident last week . The stadium - known locally as Itaquerao - was 94 per cent completed and work was due to end next month. An engineer working on the project told Sky News before the accident that the construction was going to plan and the £218million stadium would be finished by the deadline. The stadium was  already eight months overdue, and was due to be completed in March, but now builders have seven months to try and repair the extensive damage. The final part of the structure was being installed at the Corinthians Arena when the collapse happened . Delayed: The arena was due to be completed at the end of December to meet a Fifa deadline. A man takes a picture of the collapsed crane while workers assess the area . More than 2,000 people were working on the site, but only a small number of people were at the stadium at the time of the collapse. It is designed to seat 65,000 people during the tournament next summer and host six games, including a semi-final. However it is not immediately clear whether the damage will impact the 2014 competition schedule. A FIFA spokesman said: 'FIFA and the LOC have learnt of the death of workers at the Corinthian's Arena site in Sao Paulo with great sadness. 'We wish to send our heartfelt condolences to the family of the workers who tragically died today.' Football's governing body added that the 'safety of workers is the top priority' to World Cup organizers. 'We know the safety of all workers has always been paramount for all the construction companies contracted to build the 12 FIFA World Cup stadiums. 'The local authorities will fully investigate the reasons behind such a tragic accident.' Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said: 'Extremely shocked by the news from Sao Paulo. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims of this accident. Probe: The stadium's constructors  Odebrecht said it was already investigating the accident . The Itaquerao Stadium was almost complete when the accident happened. The enormous crane is visible in this picture after crashing through the stand . Authorities fear more people may have been killed in the accident and are searching for victims . This is not the first time Brazil has suffered setbacks and experienced accidents at stadium construction sites. One worker died during construction of a stadium in the capital Brasilia last year and another in the Manaus venue in March. Also . in March, heavy rains flooded the construction site of the Maracana . Stadium, forcing the cancellation of a FIFA inspection visit at the . time. In May, a small part of the roof at the Salvador stadium fell in . after it wasn't able to sustain the large amount of water that settled . on top of it. In April, . another worker died at the construction site of the new Palmeiras . stadium, which may be used for teams training for the World Cup in Sao . Paulo. The construction . site was stopped for 10 days after the incident, but the damage was not . as significant as at the Corinthians venue. The accident is the latest blow to construction work which is hoping to six of the 12 stadiums finished by December ahead of the World Cup. Work at the Arena da Amazonia stadium in Manaus has been beset by tropical rain. Six . of the stadiums are due to be handed to FIFA by December 20.

"The majority of the American workplace is either indifferent or downright hateful about their job--and fancy perks and benefits doesn't help. Only 30 per cent of employees are engaged and inspired at their jobs, according to a survey of more than 150,000 full- and part-time workers in 2012 for Gallup's 2013 State of the American Workplace Report. While this is a 2 per cent increase from 2010, begrudging and disgruntled employees still make up 18 per cent of the workforce—and cost the U.S. up to $550 billion in lost productivity, CNBC reported. 'These employees, who have bosses from hell that make them miserable, roam the halls spreading discontent,' explains Gallup CEO Jim Clifton in the report. Frustrated: Discontented employees make up 18 per cent of the American workforce, according to a new Gallup report . The rest of workers surveyed are completely indifferent about their work or 'actively disengaged', as Clifton put it. In other terms, these employees don't hate their work, but they aren't reaching their full potential either. In an effort to boost morale, many companies offer extensive perks to their employees. Google, which has graced the top of several best companies to work for, has unlimited free food and drink, nap pods and massage chairs at its California headquarters. Management consultant Bob Nelson, author of '1,501 Ways to Reward Employees', told CNBC these benefits are alluring to new workers. 'They're often looking for things they can brag about to their peers,' Nelson said. But the Gallup report said that employee engagement has a better impact on worker's well being and productivity than these benefits. Working: Only 30 per cent of employees are engaged and inspired at their jobs, the Gallup report says . 'At the end of the day, an intrinsic connection to one's work and one’s company is what truly drives performance, inspires discretionary effort, and improves well being,' the report says. This sentiment is echoed by several experts, including Randy Allen, the associate dean of Cornell University's Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management. 'There's a lot of research out there that says, although it depends on the employee, the perks come out as less important as job satisfaction,' Allen said. Having a satisfying job, a manager you respect and job growth opportunities is more important, Allen said. 'If you don't have those fundamentals, the perks aren't going to fix it,' he said. 'You may keep them for a while, but at some point they're going to leave.' The average Millennial or 20-something plan to stay at work for less than three years, making 'job hopping' the new normal with the younger workforce, according to Forbes. Average workers stay with a company for at least four years before moving on. Disengaged: Poor managers who fail to engage and inspire their employees cost the U.S. up to $550 billion annually . Data from Glassdoor.com, a job and career community site, showed that salary was still important in job satisfaction, along with workplace culture, CNBC reported. In it's report, Gallup notes that smaller companies and those that allow employees to work remotely have shown increased job productivity. Communication, holding managers accountable and developing further learning opportunities is key, according to Gallup. The report notes that workers in professions, such as healthcare and education, are more engaged than average workers, because their jobs reflect their interests.

"PC Gareth Gricks hanged himself at his home hours before he was due to be charged with child sex offences . A shamed police officer killed himself just hours before he was due to be charged with child sex offences, an inquest was told today. PC Gareth Gricks, 53, was facing allegations of paedophilia in Thailand and a sexual assault on a young woman in the UK. He had already been sacked after 19 years’ service with Norfolk Police and was set to be charged with nine offences. But on the day he was due to answer bail the divorced grandfather was discovered hanged in the garage at his home. Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Jacqueline Lake said: 'I will record a conclusion of suicide. I am satisfied he took his own life.' The coroner read a statement from PC Gricks’ mother Shirley Matthews, which revealed he had been 'finding life difficult' before his death. It read: 'It was clear that he had been finding life difficult because of things that were happening in his personal life. 'I have no doubt that he was trying to put on a brave face for the sake of his family and friends. But I believe he was feeling low and depressed in the weeks before he died. 'Gareth was a very popular person who will be much missed by his family and friends.' PC Gricks hanged himself at his home in Dunton, Norfolk, on August 6 this year and his body was discovered by a member of his family. The inquest in Norwich was told police officers found notes to Mr Gricks’ family and friends making it clear he intended to take his own life. PC Gricks had been told he would be charged with three counts of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence and one of making indecent images of children. He was also facing five counts of sexual assault against an adult female in this country. Investigators believed he was using an online forum to make contact with girls under the age of 16. Around 100 indecent images are said to have been found on his computer. Misconduct: Gareth Gricks was dismissed from Norfolk Police in response to the allegations . PC Gricks, who was based at King’s Lynn, was first arrested in May, the day after he returned from a holiday in Thailand after allegations were made to police. He was released on bail but sacked for gross misconduct on July 15. Norfolk Constabulary today declined to comment on the conclusion of the inquest. The force confirmed none of the alleged offences took place while he was on duty. Speaking at the time of Mr Gricks’ death, Norfolk Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Nick Dean said the force took 'immediate action' after being told about the alleged offences. The officer was arrested and suspended before being dismissed by the Chief Constable. He added: 'As a result of his death, there can be no criminal prosecution and the investigation effectively ceases. 'However, in recognition of his role and the serious nature of the offences he was due to face, it is right and proper that this information is placed in the public domain - not only to demonstrate police action but also to give victims of sexual abuse a voice when this cannot be achieved through the judicial process.'","Inquest into death of PC Gareth Gricks recorded a verdict of suicide .

"A mugger has been jailed for 11 years today for fatally injuring a pensioner as she tried to hold on to her bag as he snatched it from her. Marvin Blake grabbed Carole Mudie's bag just yards from her home as she walked from her car after a night out at the bingo with friends. The retired case worker, 68, was thrown to the ground clinging to her handbag. Marvin Blake (left) has been jailed for 11 years for the manslaughter of Carole Mudie (right) who died after he threw her to the ground trying to steal her handbag . The fall broke the grandmother’s hip - an injury which ultimately directly led to her death, as police were able to prove. She had just £30 in her bag at the time. Blake, 37, of no fixed address, was jailed after admitting manslaughter, robbing Mrs Mudie of her handbag and three further charges of theft at Birmingham Crown Court. Mrs Mudie, who suffered with osteoporosis and sclerosis, died in hospital two weeks after the mugging, as a result of complications stemming from the shattered femur she sustained on the night of Sunday, January 6. The grandmother, of Hawkesley, Birmingham, had won at the bingo that evening, texting her daughter the news and telling her the money was going 'in the pot' for a big family holiday in 2014. Judge William Davis QC told Blake he had 'plainly targeted' Mrs Mudie, first walking up to her in her parked car under the auspices of going to ask her the time before later stalking up behind her to rip the handbag from her right arm, just yards from her doorstep. 'Inevitably she fell, while accepting it wasn't great violence in the sense you didn't then use violence when she was on the floor, you employed violence to get what you wanted,' he said. The judge said Blake targeted Mrs Mudie when she was just yards from her home in Hawkmoor Gardens, Hawkesley, Birmingham . 'All for £30 in her handbag and some personal effects. 'Sadly, . although treated entirely properly at hospital the serious injuries you . caused her led to complications and a couple of weeks later she died. 'And that death has caused huge upset, grief and trauma to the family she left behind. 'Not just her son and daughter, but her grandchildren.' Days before the fatal robbery, Blake had snatched purses from other long elderly women, aged 73 and 82, while they shopped. He also pulled a 60-year-old woman from her delivery van to steal her sat-nav. Stephen Linehan, Blake's barrister, offered as mitigation his client's 'courageous' decision to admit to robbery and manslaughter, without first conferring with his counsel. 'He has destroyed a complete, fantastic family. She idolised her grandchildren, and she had a fantastic sense of humour - she was great fun,' Cary Healey, Carole Mudie's daughter . 'He is genuinely remorseful, penitent and recognises his actions have caused enormous suffering,' he added. Judge Davis said his offending was of 'very grave seriousness' and had left his other victims nervous, anxious and upset, with one nearly giving up her job as a result of the frightening experience, while another had sought medical help. Cary Healey, Mrs Mudie's daughter, said Blake had 'destroyed a complete, fantastic family' adding she felt nothing but hatred for the man. After the hearing, Mrs Healey said the family could now get on with grieving for their loss with Blake behind bars. She said: 'I am pleased (with the sentence) for the safety of others. It's not going to bring my mum back, but other people will be safer. 'She was my best friend, we went everywhere together, we watched all the same television programmes. 'She had a huge circle of friends - went on holiday with the girls, went out weekly with the girls. 'She idolised her grandchildren, and she had a fantastic sense of humour - she was great fun.' Mrs Healey added: 'She'd been out with friends - she'd go to bingo every Sunday and I usually got a text telling me how much she had won. Mrs Mudie was returning home from a night at bingo when she was mugged by Blake . 'And she had won that night, so it was all going in the pot for her next holiday.' Following sentencing, West Midlands Police's Detective Sergeant Andy Bradley, senior investigating officer, described the crime as 'particularly abhorrent' for Blake, who preyed solely on elderly women. He said: 'I'm glad the judge has recognised the severity of Blake's offences, and he's going to be behind bars for a considerable time. 'He was a man who targeted elderly and vulnerable victims, going to places like shops, post offices, care homes, and who relied on sleight-of-hand to commit crime without being noticed. 'But if found out he had no compunction in using violence to commit his crimes. 'In this case, he knocked over Carole Mudie so severely she broke her hip, and ultimately she died from those injuries.' He added: 'It is a particularly abhorrent crime - those are the only words I can use, and I am just glad for Mrs Mudie's family that we have caught him and got him behind bars and that is the best result we could hope for.' Jailing Blake, Judge Davis also ordered a seven-year extension to the licence period for the offence of manslaughter, telling him he would be under the watchful eye of the authorities for 18 years. For the offences of theft, committed on December 27, and December 28, 2012, and January 3, 2013, he imposed a year in prison for each of the counts, and a four-year sentence for the robbery, to be served concurrently.","Marvin Blake threw Carole Mudie to the ground as he tried to steal her bag .

"Convicted: Waseem Daker, now 35, spent a decade behind bars for stalking Loretta Blatz; he was found guilty of killing her roommate . A man who became obsessed with a woman on his paintball team and proceeded to stalk her is now on trial for the murder of the woman's roommate. In an unnerving twist, Waseem Daker fired his court-appointed lawyer so now he is the one questioning Loretta Spencer Blatz, the woman who he used to stalk and who was the reason why he spent 10 years behind bars. Ms Blatz's former roommate, Karmen Smith, was killed in October 1996. Smith was found strangled to death and her five-year-old son Nickolas was stabbed multiple times during the attack but survived and will be testifying later in the trial. Daker, who is now 35-years-old, met Ms Blatz when the two were on the same paintball team in Georgia. They became close when Daker, who was then only a teenager enrolled at Georgia Tech University, began confiding in Ms Blatz. 'I felt like his bigger sister. He was reaching out and needing somebody. He told me he didn’t have anyone to talk to. I was trying to help him,' she said in court according to The Marietta Daily Journal. Daker was 12 years her junior and soon after they became friends, their relationship turned more serious. While Daker is arguing in court that they were on-again-off-again lovers, Ms Blatz has always denied that version of events and said that he began calling her at the home where she lived with her then-10-year-old daughter 50 or 100 times a day. 'He would get extremely irate and say I was the only one he had to talk to and would kill himself if I would not talk to him. I told him he needed to seek professional help,' Ms Blatz said. 'The more I told him no, the more he was really persistent in talking to me.' The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that Daker is attempting to brand Ms Blatz a liar since a number of threatening instances that she claims against Daker- like when he allegedly threatened to slit her daughter's throat, tried to run her car off the road, or when he hung bras and underwear on her doorknob her for her to find- were never reported to police. 'Many things may not be on this report,' she said in court, unable to contain her tears. 'My intention was to get (the stalking) to stop. At the time I didn't know it would lead to what it... what it led to.' Scene: At the time of her murder, Karmen Smith lived in the basement apartment of the house on Old Hunter's Trace (pictured) where  Loretta Blatz lived in Marietta, Georgia, . In an effort to cut him off, she and her daughter moved from Roswell to Cobb County, but that didn't end his unwanted attention. 'I walked into my apartment and heard my clock radio on. In my bedroom was Waseem Daker ... He was naked and he had a garter belt and garter hose on and was looking at himself in my mirror,' she said of one such incident. Shortly after that May 1995 incident, she called the police and he was arrested, though she later dropped the charges after he promised that he would get help. Months later Ms Smith, a Delta flight attendant who lived in the basement of Ms Blatz's home, was found dead. Daker was always listed as a possible suspect but at the time there was not enough evidence to charge him with the crime. The next year, Daker was convicted of stalking Ms Blatz and spent the following 10 years in jail. Though he was released in 2006, it wasn't until 2009 when DNA testing was able to link Daker to the Smith crime scene when they traced several hairs on the victim's body to him. One of the most intense portions of the trial was the cross examination of Ms Blatz by her convicted stalker. At one point, ABC News reports that Daker tried to have the judge label some portion of her testimony as 'inappropriate'. 'Well, you know, it’s really inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me, and you’re sitting here asking me questions, and I have to come back with you and answer your questions, that’s hard for me!' she said.","Waseem Daker met Loretta Spencer Blatz in 1995 when they were on the same paintball team .

"If the catfights off the set of Real Housewives of Atlanta are any indication of things to come when the new season begins, get ready for the fur to fly when the hit Bravo show returns to the air next month. Newcomer Claudia Jordan and pack leader NeNe Leakes are clawing at each other already. Favorite Georgia Peaches. Cynthia Bailey, Kandi Burruss, Kenya Moore, Phaedra Parks and NeNe all return along with Claudia, who will be on board as a new full-time Housewife. After two and a half seasons, Porsha Williams will no longer be a full-time cast member on the series.but will have a recurring role as a 'friend' of the Housewives alongside newcomer actress-singer Demetria McKinney. Scroll down for video . Catfight!  NeNe Leakes and Claudia Jordan went at it on the recent cast trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico . Bikini babes: Claudia Jordan (left) and Kenya Moore (center) have been good friends but is Kenya getting a little jealous of Claudia's fast rise on the show?  Cynthia Bailey is along for the (boat) ride . MailOnline revealed in August that McKinney, 32, former star of Tyler Perry's House of Payne,  joined the cast along with Celebrity Apprentice star Jordan, 41. Both McKinney and Jordan was originally slated to be secondary cast members on the show - Bravo calls them 'B Characters.' However, an on-camera feud with the 46-year-old NeNe apparently changed that and thrust Jordan to main character position. A source close to the show tells MailOnline that the drama has already been intense. During a trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico, all the cast members were having dinner when Jordan and Leakes began to argue. 'Claudia kept trying to start an argument with NeNe to get attention,' a show insider told MailOnline. 'After a few subtle digs, NeNe let into her; claiming that Claudia has a reputation for sleeping with lots of men in Hollywood  and wearing ""cheap"" clothes. The seventh season of  RHOA, featuring (left to right) Cynthia Baily, Phaedra Parks, Claudia Jordan, Kandi Burruss, Nene Leakes and Kenya Moore is back on the air next month . Hanging out: Cynthia, Claudia and Kenya enjoying the seaside in San Juan . 'Nene called Claudia  a ""pretender"" who was desperately trying to get a job on the show and living living in Kenya's shadow,' revealed the source. Jordan did not taking her verbal assault from Leakes lying down and quickly lashed back. 'Claudia told NeNe that she was just a few years from being off the stripper pole for good and that if she kept spending all her money on plastic surgery, she would have to brush up on her pole dancing routine. 'She also told NeNe that maybe she should've brought back some of her old stripper moves while doing Dancing with the Stars. Then maybe she would have won,' the source continued. NeNe was eliminated from the show last April, in the seventh week of the season. Jordan and Leakes have since become bitter enemies, initially to the delight of former Miss USA winner Kenya Moore, who brought Jordan aboard the reality series as her friend. Party girls: Smile for the camera! But a show insider says Jordan and Leakes have  become bitter enemies, initially to the delight of former Miss USA winner Kenya Moore, who brought Jordan aboard the reality series as her friend . 'Initially it was seemed as though Kenya loved having an ally to help her combat NeNe. 'But the more producers got excited about Claudia stepping up and willingly going up against NeNe, it started to cause some tension between the two friends,' the show insider explained. Those on set believe that Moore is becoming jealous of how Jordan has upstaged her on the show. She was trying to help her friend get a job and now Claudia has advanced by leaps and bounds from a part time cast member to a full time one. 'Kenya has made it clear that Claudia is her friend and she is responsible for getting her on the show. She griped to the executive producer that they were spending a lot of time focusing on Claudia and she didn't appreciate that,' the source revealed. Show insiders believe it's only a matter of time before Moore and Jordan are at odds too, but meanwhile the former 'Deal or No Deal' and 'The Price is Right' model continues to keep Leakes on her toes.","The Georgia peaches of RHOA hit the beach in San Juan, but the mood was hardly playful .

"David Cameron vowed to fight 'incredibly hard' to secure a good deal at today's EU summit . European leaders today claimed Britain will 'have to be convinced' to accept a rise in Brussels spending as David Cameron scrambled to build support for a real terms freeze. The Prime Minister today warned any increase in the European Union's budget would be 'quite wrong'. He vowed to protect the UK's prized rebate from Brussels negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. But Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's PM calling for a Budget increase, said Britain will have to fall into line. 'I can't imagine how we can convince them, but they will have to be convinced,' he told reporters as talks began in Brussels. Mr Cameron flew out of Britain early this morning to be the first leader to hold face-to-face talks with Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso. The pair are meeting the other 26 EU leaders today ahead of formal talks over dinner tonight. But tensions are already rising, with Britain demanding a cut or freeze in spending while other countries who benefit from vast EU handouts demanding big rises. Sweden and the Netherlands have . joined Britain in demanding big cuts. Germany, France, Finland and . Austria want to freeze the maximum Brussels can draw from member states . every year. But 15 countries, led by Poland, want to see budget increases. Amid growing speculation that the summit could continue until Sunday, Dutch PM Mark Rutte warned a deal will have to be done quickly or risk souring relations for months. 'If it doesn't happen at once we have to avoid worsening the atmosphere . by so much that we need months to restore personal relations.' Asked if he was ready to veto an unfavourable deal, Mr Rutte added: 'My idea is that you have to keep your loaded gun in your pocket and once you put it on the table you are putting so much pressure on the negotiations that they don't lead anywhere. I always have a loaded gun in my pocket during negotiations, only figuratively speaking, of course.' Mr Cameron, who had a half hour meeting with Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso, said: 'These are very important negotiations and clearly, at a time when we're making difficult decisions at home over public spending, it would be quite wrong - it is quite wrong - for there to be proposals for this increased extra spending in the EU. 'So we're going to be negotiating very hard for a good deal for Britain's taxpayers and for Europe's taxpayers, and to keep the British rebate.' The summit will look to set the maximum ceiling for EU spending for 2014 to 2020 rather than the UK's contribution. Mr van Rompuy has drawn up plans for a ceiling of 973 billion euros (£783 billion) at 2011 values. This . would represent a real-terms cut compared to the 993 billion euros . limit for 2007-13. It is also well below the European Commission's . request for 1,033 billion euros. Nick Clegg said today: 'What we want from the European Union is just common sense. There is not enough money to go around at the moment. Everyone is tightening their belts, let's make sure it is reflected in the EU budget.' The Prime Minister has vowed to fight 'incredibly hard' to protect Britain's rebate . A UK official said today: 'The Prime Minister wants an agreement, he is looking for an agreement,"" said one UK official. But he wants the EU budget to reflect what is happening in member states - and he wants the best deal for British taxpayers.' Mr van Rompuy is holding one-on-one talks with all 27 leaders, including Mr Cameron, today before the summit formally opens. Later . he will produce a new 'negotiation box' which will try to take account . of all the competing priorities of different countries. There will then be a new round of wrangling. A third of countries is threatening to use a veto. The summit is due to end on Friday, but could last until Saturday or even Sunday. One . official said: 'Mr Van Rompuy will keep the leaders talking as long as . it looks likely that there can be agreement. 'But he will not want to keep them at . the negotiating table all weekend if the result is going to be a . failure. There is the credibility of the EU to consider - better to end . early and return another day than end in complete disarray.' Leaders arriving at the summit today included European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who has criticised those calling for a spending cut, and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias . Ahead of today's crunch summit . that is turning into a key diplomatic test of Mr Cameron’s premiership, . France made it clear it is aiming to prise more cash out of the UK in . the EU’s budget settlement for 2014 to 2020. France’s socialist president Francois . Hollande launched a thinly veiled attack on Britain’s ‘lack of . solidarity’ with Europe for demanding it maintains its budget rebate. Mr Hollande, whose country lost its . AAA credit rating this week after putting the brakes on austerity . measures, said countries he ‘would not name’ would come to the EU budget . summit in Brussels today looking for ‘their discounts’. ‘At the exact moment we are calling . for solidarity and mobilisation for growth, there are these countries . that will be coming to get their cheques, their rebates and their . discounts,’ he declared. ‘The idea that they have of Europe is . to obtain exactly what they put in, as if solidarity doesn’t represent . the most fortunate providing for the most hard up.’ Margaret Thatcher found that Britain's payments were relatively higher than other countries . And last night European Commission . president Jose Manuel Barroso attacked those – such as Mr Cameron – . proposing cuts to EU spending. ‘The European budget is not, as is . sometimes claimed, a budget for Brussels  or Strasbourg,’ he said. ‘It . is a budget  for investing in the economy of all  member states. ‘I have listened to the preparatory . discussions, which all focus on how to make cuts. There is no real . debate on the quality of investment – it is just cuts, cuts, cuts.’ European Council president Herman Van . Rompuy appears open to British demands that the EU budget should be . cut, but is understood to be proposing an £800million-a-year reduction . in the rebate. But in a sign of the scale of . disagreement across the Continent, Britain is just one of ten countries . threatening to block the proposed deal if changes are not made. In the Commons, Tory MP David Nuttall . challenged Mr Cameron to promise to veto any deal that reduces the . rebate. The Prime Minister answered: ‘I can give my honourable friend . that assurance. The rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher, is an . incredibly important part of making sure Britain gets a fair deal in . Europe.’ David Cameron seen with President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, will discuss the EU's budget cut . Mr Cameron launched a strong attack on . Labour for giving up a chunk of the rebate in 2005 in return for . reforms of agricultural subsidies that never materialised. ‘It is absolutely extraordinary that . the last government gave away almost half of that rebate and we’ve never . heard one word of apology, one word of regret, for the fact that . however hard we fight in Europe – and I will be fighting incredibly hard . this week for a good deal – they cut away our feet by giving away half . the rebate,’ he said. The rebate secured by Mrs Thatcher in . Fontainebleau in 1984 is designed to compensate the UK for the fact that . it receives relatively little support under the Common Agricultural . Policy compared with similarly sized economies such as France. It is worth about £2.9billion, and . meant that Britain’s net contribution to the  EU budget in 2010 was . £5.9billion rather than £8.8billion. Labour agreed that the rebate should . no longer apply to investment in relatively poor new member states, . meaning Britain’s contributions will inevitably rise as the EU enlarges.","Prime Minister takes early flight to start crunch talks with European leaders .

"Ever get the feeling your face shape is ruining all your relationships? It might just be. Whether you have a pointy chin, round cheeks, a sharp jawbone or a soft brow could lead men of a certain persuasion to be falling for you. Men looking for a bit of a fling tend to go for women with delicate, feminine features... while those after something serious often go for more masculine women, according to a new study. Men choose women with feminine features for flings, and those with more masculine features for long-term relationships, according to the study . Several hundred . heterosexual male volunteers were shown a selection of faces made up of . composite parts, and researchers asked the men which they would choose . for a short relationship, and which for a longer one . It even seems that when making long-term choices, men are likelier to plump for less attractive women. As reported in CTV News, men are subconsciously driven towards less attractive women because - as has been found in previous studies - they are less likely to be unfaithful. 'If his partner cheats on him, a man risks raising a child which is not his own,' explained study authors Anthony Little from . the University of Stirling and Benedict Jones from the University of . Glasgow, in the British Journal of Psychology. For the study, several hundred heterosexual male volunteers were shown a selection of faces made up of composite parts, and researchers asked the men which they would choose for a short relationship, and which for a longer one. The results echo studies in how women choose mates: in these studies females similarly prefer chiselled, robust men for a fling and softer, less testosterone-packed ones with which to settle down . There were two versions of each face - . one slightly more feminine, the other more masculine. They found that men rated women with more feminine features more highly for a fling, particularly if the man was already in a relationship. The more masculine and less attractive women higher as wives. The results echo studies in how women choose mates: in these studies females similarly prefer chiselled, robust men for a fling and softer, less testosterone-packed ones with which to settle down, - possibly as they are considered more reliable for raising children.","Men looking for fling go for women with feminine features .

"To his legions of admirers on this side of the pond, there is no need to fret. Frank Lampard will stay for as long as he is wanted.

VIDEO Scroll down for Manuel Pellegrini raises smiles over Frank Lampard's future . Frank Lampard, pictured with Sergio Aguero, appears to be happy at Manchester City after summer move . The former Chelsea midfielder did not fail to share his delight at scoring against Southampton . Pablo Zabaleta, Yaya Toure and Fernandinho celebrate with Lampard after the loan star doubles his side's lead . Here at St Mary’s there was another touch of the old magic when he lifted himself off the bench to score Manchester City’s second goal against Southampton. It was textbook Lampard. This was a rasping strike from the edge of the area, the type he used to despatch so regularly when he was wearing the colours of Chelsea. Suddenly those days when he was chasing down the great Bobby Tambling’s goalscoring record, which he eventually overhauled, feels like a lifetime ago. There is no doubt, after four months as a City player, Lampard is a blue through and through. ‘I don’t think anyone can find it strange the way Frank Lampard plays football,’ claimed City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini. ‘He knows how to play the game. At the age of 36 he cannot play three games in a week, not 90 minutes every game, but he played 90 minutes against Bayern Munich so it wasn’t good for him to start again. Lampard's shot flew past Maya Yoshida and Fraser Forster before hitting the back of the net . Manuel Pellegrini will look to keep Lampard at the Etihad Stadium for as long as possible . Manchester City 1-1 Chelsea (1) Manchester City 7-0 Sheffield Wednesday (2) Hull 2-4 Manchester City . ‘He always makes the difference because he is a top player.’ Stateside they will will wonder when they will ever see Lampard wearing the New York City shirt because when life is this good, you don’t want to walk away from something like this. In a couple of weeks’ time, provided City overcome the final hurdle in their Champions League group game with Roma, they will be in the draw for second round. Anyone who has ever come into contact with Lampard, who is technically on loan from his American team, will know of the midfielder’s love for European football’s elite competition. He has played in seven Champions League semi-finals, going on to win it with Chelsea in 2012 and you simply wouldn’t bet against him going deep in to this competition with City. To walk away from that, plus the realistic possibility of slugging it out with Chelsea for the Barclays Premier League title, is not in Lampard’s make-up. The guy is a winner. It is unthinkable for him to leave mid-way through a campaign, particularly when Lampard calls all the shots. It’s his decision. The alternative is to join in with pre-season training with the other six players who have so far been signed by New York City in preparation for their MLS bow in March. You do the math. Lampard’s numbers are already stacking up at City. This was his fifth goal since his surprise move to the Etihad following his release by Jose Mourinho last season. Pellegrini worked with Robert Pires after the French midfielder left Arsenal to join Villarreal . Lampard and Steven Gerrard know they will have to play the rotation game if they are to prolong their careers . ‘Players have longer careers than some years ago,’ added Pellegrini. ‘I had Robert Pires (at Villarreal) in his last years as well and he was very good. ‘The top players know how to do it. They know best every time they have the ball.’ Timing, as the 256 goals he has scored in his professional career with West Ham, Swansea, Chelsea and Manchester City, is everything. He has also proved, that managed correctly, it is possible to stretch a career at the very highest level into the mid-thirties. This is a problem for Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool as he works out a way to get the best from the captain Steven Gerrard at the age of 34. Rotation and rest is the answer. Lampard accepts that his days as a nailed on starter are over and yet he continues to make an impact whenever he plays. It is only a matter of time before City’s supporters strike up the tune: ‘Frank Lampard we want you to stay’ for a man they voted the club’s player of the month in September. You just know, judging by the smile on Lampard’s face when he arrowed his effort beyond the reach of Southampton keeper Fraser Forster, how much he loves this sport. There should be more built like him. He enjoys working with Pellegrini and is known to be quite taken with the management methods of City’s coach. Lampard has responded to his relaxed, yet thorough, style. ‘Frank is not only a top player but a great profession and person,’ added Pellegrini. ‘He’s very happy here and he also enjoys the way we play. ‘He makes a difference in the last 25-30 minutes and we’re very happy with him.’ After this, they just need to work out a way to break the bad news to his USA Fan Club.","Frank Lampard scored second goal in 3-0 win against Southampton .

"The disappearance of Mikaeel Kular  sparked a major ground, air and sea search in Edinburgh. His mother Rosdeep Adekoya is alleged to have murdered him and then hidden the body . The mother of three-year-old Mikaeel Kular has appeared in court accused of murdering her son. Rosdeep Adekoya, 34, is charged with assaulting Mikaeel at her Edinburgh home in January and hiding his body in woodland in Fife. It is alleged she attempted to defeat the ends of justice by pretending to police he had gone missing, sparking a major search by the emergency services and members of the public. Ms Adekoya appeared before judge Lord Boyd at the High Court in Edinburgh today. The Crown allege that she murdered her son after assaulting him on various occasions between January 12 and January 15. Prosecutors also claim that she attempted to defeat the ends of justice by telling lies to police officers who were investigating her child’s disappearance. Ms Adekoya, whose address was given in legal documents as being a prisoner of the prison of Cornton Vale in Stirlingshire, did not enter a plea during the two minute long hearing. She was dressed in black, wore glasses and sat beside two security officers during proceedings. Prosecutors allege that on various occasions between January 12 and January 15 at her flat, Ms Adekoya assaulted her three-year-old son by repeatedly seizing hold of him and repeatedly punching him on the head and body. It is claimed that her actions caused his body to strike against a hard object and that she inflicted blunt force injuries on his head and body. Prosecutors also claim that she failed to seek medical attention for him and that she murdered him. Vanished: Volunteers help in the search for the three-year-old in Edinburgh in January.

Police forensic officers (left) work on an entrance door to block of flats in Edinburgh after the toddler went missing. Right, a police officer and aK-9 unit search an area close to where Mikaeel vanished . The second charge alleges that between January 14 and January 17 2014, at the Edinburgh address and an area of woodland behind a house in Kirkcaldy, Fife, and at Drylaw Police Office in Edinburgh, Ms Adekoya attempted to defeat the ends of justice. Prosecutors allege that she did this in a bid to avoid being detected, arrested and prosecuted for the crime. She is alleged to have wrapped Mikaeel's body in a duvet cover, put it in a suitcase and driven to Fife, where prosecutors say she hid the case under a bush in woods behind a house. She is alleged to have reported her son missing to police, telling officers he got out of bed and climbed on a stool to unlock the front door of his home. A young girl reads one of the tributes left near the Edinburgh home of Mikaeel Kular, after his body was discovered .

Prosecutors say she did this and caused a police investigation to be launched into his disappearance and that a major search was then made for him which involved police officers, members of the fire service, the coastguard, the mountain rescue, air support and members of the public. Today prosecution lawyer Alex Prentice QC . told the court that there had been discussions between the Crown and Ms . Adekoya’s legal representatives. Mr . Prentice said that these discussions were on going and asked for the . case to be continued to a hearing at Edinburgh High Court later this . month. Ms Adekoya’s defence advocate .

"Let me be perfectly clear ... I didn't mean it! Obama changed his rhetoric Monday night, backing off from his oft-repeated promise that no American would be forced to abandon his or her health insurance under Obamacare . President Barack Obama told cheering throngs in Washington, D.C. Monday night that he never truly promised Americans could keep their health insurance plans once his Affordable Care Act became law. 'If you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it – if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,' he claimed. 'So we wrote into the Affordable Care . Act, you're grandfathered in on that plan. But if the insurance company . changes it, then what we're saying is they've got to change it to a . higher standard.' He remarks came at the posh St. Regis hotel during a meeting of Organizing For Action, the nonprofit pressure group that grew out of his presidential campaign organization Obama For America. But at least 29 videotaped examples available online show Obama promising between 2008 and this year, in only slightly varied language, that 'if you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period.' It wasn't until after the Obamacare program's central website had its disastrous launch, and millions of Americans began receiving insurance cancellation letters, that the White House took a new tack. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Means to an end: Obama is playing for his presidential legacy, and gambling that the Affordable Care Act will work out in the end; his throngs of fans don't seem bothered by word-parsing or repeated promises . 'If you like your plan, and you like your doctor, you won't have to do a thing,' Obama said on June 23, 2009. 'You keep your plan' More recently, the president and his press flacks have begun to insert into that promise the caveat that Obama uttered Monday: that Obamacare will only let Americans keep their existing insurance plans if nothing about them changes from year to year. 'If the insurance company changes it, then what we're saying is they've got to change it to a higher standard,' Obama told his fans at the St. Regis. 'They've got to make it better. They've got to improve the quality of the plan they are selling.' The Affordable Care Act itself, however, requires all medical insurance plans sold in the U.S. to include a raft of minimum coverage benefits, a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn't appeal to many buyers. Pediatric coverage, maternity care and dental insurance, for instance, are options that the elderly, the single and the frugal have chosen not to pay for in previous years. Requiring those additions, and seven others, have put millions of Americans with 'grandfathered' policies in the position of being forbidden to keep plans they have happily purchased and renewed for years. One estimate has 2.5 million such cancellation letters already sent in the U.S., with a peak of 12 million or more expected by year's end. In a January 2010 speech, Obama promised taxpayers that 'if you want to keep the health insurance you've got, you can keep it' Game change: HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was left holding the bag as Obamacare's online launch fell apart, and may keep catching spears for Obama as Americans become more frustrated with insurance cancellations . Some of the videotaped examples of Obama's campaign-style rhetoric are striking for their unqualified language. During a June 15, 2009 speech at the American Medical Association's annual meeting, he pledged that 'no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. (If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period.' On September 12 of that year, he told an Obamacare rally in Minneapolis that 'nothing in this plan requires you to change what you have if you're happy with it.' Obama's January 27, 2010 State Of The Union address to Congress included the reassurance that 'our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan.' Speaking at George Mason University in suburban Virginia on March 27, 2010, he doubled down on that claim. 'If you like your doctor, you’re going to be able to keep your doctor,' Obama said, to strong applause. 'If you like your plan, keep your plan.' 'I don’t believe we should give government or the insurance companies more control over health care in America. I think it’s time to give you, the American people, more control over your health.' His rhetoric got progressively more definitive as 2010 wore on. 'If you're happy with what you've got,' nobody's changing it,' the president said in September 2010, just weeks before that year's congressional midterm election . This man's Anthem BlueCross BlueShield policy was cancelled, and he was offered new insurance at nearly triple the price. He send this photo to MyCancellation.com . The president abruptly changed his promise on Monday, telling a friendly crown that 'If you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it ¿ if it hasn¿t changed since the law passed' On April 1 in Portland, Maine, Obama promised that 'if Americans like their doctor, they will keep their doctor. And if you like your insurance plan, you will keep it.' 'No one will be able to take that away from you. It hasn’t happened yet. t won’t happen in the future.' Later, during his October 12, 2012 presidential debate with Republican Mitt Romney, the president assured Americans that 'if you've got health insurance, [Obamacare] doesn't mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor.' Cassandra complex (look it up): Rep. Tom Price floated his own health care bill in 2009 while insisting that Obama couldn't possibly keep his promises . Taken together, the Washington Post's fact-checker wrote last week, 'his repeated pledge ... is one of the most famous statements of his presidency.' The Post gave it a dreaded 'four Pinocchios' rating for dishonesty, its worst grade. The paper says four-Pinocchio lies qualify as 'whoppers.' 'The president's statements were sweeping and unequivocal – and made both before and after the bill became law,' the Post ruled. 'The White House now cites technicalities to avoid admitting that he went too far.' The Post noted, too, that Republicans were calling shenanigans on Obama's pledge as early as the first year of his presidency. Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, a medical doctor himself, proposed an alternative health care bill in 2009. During the Republican Party's weekly address on Aug. 24 of that year, Price claimed Obama wasn't playing it straight. 'On the stump, the president regularly tells Americans that ""if you like your plan, you can keep your plan,""' Price said. 'But if you read the bill, that just isn’t so.' 'For starters, within five years, every health care plan will have to meet a new federal definition for coverage – one that your current plan might not match, even if you like it.' Obama is now calling those plans 'substandard,' and playing up his insurance law's aspiration to upgrade every policy, even at a sometimes significant cash price. The website MyCancellation.com has collected dozens of insurance cancellations letters from Americans who have lost their policies. Most are being told to choose between renewing at more than twice the price, or casting their lot with the Obamacare federal health insurance exchange.","Obama suddenly pivoted Monday night, adding conditions to his pledge that no one would lose insurance plans that they liked .
The Affordable Care Act requires policies to include a set of coverage items including maternity and pediatric care, whether or not people want it .
As costs rise, insurance companies are issuing cancellation letters by the millions .
The White House isn't offering apologies for the about-face, even though the left-of-center Washington Post found that Obama's 'if you like your plan, you can keep your plan' promise was a 'whopper' of a lie ."

"Keeping a toddler quiet on a packed train is no easy task – especially since such struggles can be met with disapproving tuts from impatient fellow passengers. So single mother Samantha Welch was moved to tears when a generous stranger – impressed by her parenting of her three-year-old son Rylan – gave her £5 with a letter praising her as a ‘credit to her generation’. The mystery passenger had written his message on a scrap of paper folded around the cash, which he handed to her as he got off the train. Scroll down for video . Good mother: Sammie Welch, pictured with son Rylan, was given £5 by a stranger who saw them on a train . Note: The man left this letter praising Ms Welch for how she handled her three-year-old boy . The note said: ‘Have a drink on me. You are a credit to your generation, polite and teaching the little boy good manners.’ He signed off simply as ‘man on the train at table with glasses and hat. Have a lovely evening.’ The note went on: ‘PS I have a daughter your age... Hope when she has children she is as good a mother as you!’ Miss Welch, 23, had kept Rylan occupied by playing games and listening to music. He later fell asleep and when the train became busier she moved him on to her lap to free up a seat. She said yesterday that she was ‘overwhelmed’ by the man’s gesture and has launched an appeal on Facebook to track him down so she can thank him in person. She explained: ‘As he walked by he tapped me on the shoulder and said, “I think you’ve dropped this out of your bag,” handed me the note and got off. Family: Ms Welch and Rylan were travelling from Birmingham to Plymouth at the time of the incident . Bonding: The mother was feeding her son his dinner, and then encouraged him to give up his seat . Mystery: The young mother has no idea who her benefactor was and is trying to track him down . ‘I honestly couldn’t believe it when I read it. I read it about ten or twenty times, over and over trying to take it in. ‘I was shocked that someone I didn’t know and hadn’t even spoken to before had done this. ‘I didn’t know what I had done to make him write what he did. I was so moved, I was overwhelmed. It meant so much to me.’ She added: ‘He shows there are still good people out there and I want him to know I am truly grateful. We definitely do need more people like him – the world would be a great place.’ Have a drink on me. You are a credit to your generation, polite and teaching the little boy good manners. Man on train at table with glasses and hat . Have a lovely evening. PS I have a daughter your age, someone did the same for her once. Hope when she has children she is as good a mother as you. Miss Welch and Rylan were on a gruelling five and a half hour journey, which included changing trains – enough to test even the most placid child’s patience. She said: ‘He was good and there was no crying. It was quite exhausting for him but then he fell asleep with his head on my knee. The train was quite busy. A couple of people got on and were standing up and I offered to put him on my knee so they could have a seat.’ She had not really noticed the man until he gave her the note as he got off the train in Bristol, about an hour and half after she and Rylan had boarded in Birmingham. Miss Welch went on: ‘People look at you and judge you every day when you’re a single mum but getting that note made me feel special and proud. That might sound silly, but all I’m trying to do is make a better life for my son. ‘It really shocked me that there was money with the note, especially as money is tight for a lot of people these days.’ She has put the cash into her son’s savings account. Miss Welch recently moved to Plymouth from Crewe, Cheshire, where she worked as an IT technician. She is currently looking for a similar job. She and Rylan had visited her sister in Crewe and changed trains in Birmingham on the way home.

Here, Sportsmail assesses who will be cast aside in the new United, and which clubs will be able to pick up the pieces. Marouane Fellaini . The Belgian was United's sole signing last summer, and his mediocre performances in the middle of the park became synonymous with David Moyes' dismal reign. How much: United expect to take a hit on the £27.5million they paid and want £20million but will do well to get £15million. Who's interested: Napoli but not at the asking price. A subsidised loan suits them but they are already weighing up alternatives. Flop: Marouane Fellaini became synonymous with David Moyes' disastrous reign at Old Trafford . Javier Hernandez . 'Chicharito' has an impressive goals to games ratio in a United shirt, but his detractors suggest he needs more to his game. He's well behind the likes of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie in the pecking order and will find more opportunities elsewhere. How much: £12million would be the Mexican's price ideal but United expect closer to £10million. Who's interested: Juventus and Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Tottenham and Southampton are just some of the clubs to have expressed an interest. Poacher: But Javier Hernandez, battling against Liverpool, could be surplus to requirements . Anderson . The Portuguese has failed to live up to his reputation, with a torrid spell at Old Trafford rife with injury. With no pre-season form behind him, by now he is well down the list of Louis van Gaal's midfielders. How much: United are struggling to find takers even at a knockdown £5million. Who's interested: Clubs in Portugal and Brazil have shown interest but little else. His displays on loan at Fiorentina did little to impress. Anderson may be difficult to shift. Dead wood: Man United are facing trouble in getting rid of out-of-favour midfielder Anderson . Nani . The mercurial winger has had a career of ups and downs at Old Trafford, but it may finally be time to move on. His frustratingly inconsistent displays, along with a incompatibility with Van Gaal's wing-backs system means his United number is up. How much: A new five year deal raised his value last season but price will be around £12million to £15million. Who's interested: Juventus, Inter Milan, Valencia and Arsenal still rate the Portuguese winger despite his inconsistency. Best foot forward: Mercurial winger Nani, in action in pre-season, could be heading for the Old Trafford exit . Shinji Kagawa . Sir Alex Ferguson bought the hotly-tipped Japanese playmaker in from Borussia Dortmund to revolutionise the Red Devils' attacking threat. Although he has impressed in spells, injuries and the arrival of Juan Mata means Kagawa may have to look elsewhere for regular action. How much: United will look to get around £8million to £10million for the Japanese playmaker. Who's interested: Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp loves Kagawa. Atletico Madrid are interested too in a player who has looked resigned to leaving. Plenty interested in a loan. Return of the prodigal son? Shinji Kagawa could be in line for a return to Borussia Dortmund . Wilfried Zaha . The winger was tipped as an England World Cup star on his arrival from Crystal Palace, but has failed to live up to the hype. Farmed out on loan to Cardiff last season and another who doesn't benefit from a wing-backs formation, his move to United may have been one gamble too far. How much: United would do well to raise £10million and may prefer to send him out on loan and see if his value rises again. Who's interested: West Ham, QPR, Crystal Palace and Newcastle would all take a chance on a player who has yet to show his potential. Gamble: Wilfried Zaha has not lived up to his billing since joining Man United and could be on his way .","Marouane Fellaini, Nani and Shinji Kagawa among those on the way out .

That takes in one of the most disappointing spells in McIlroy’s career after he switched his equipment manufacturer to Nike. However, he has emerged as the world’s best player and that long-term Nike deal is rumoured to be worth £10m a year.

"Charged: David Renz allegedly stabbed a mother to death as she tried to attack him after he raped her 10-year-old daughter . Lawyers told the harrowing story of how a mother was stabbed to death as she was trying to fight off the carjacker who had just raped her 10-year-old daughter moments earlier. The prosecutor told the court how 29-year-old David Renz was trying to use cable ties to bind the woman to a headrest in her car when she fought back and shouted for the girl, whose hands were tied behind her back, to bolt from the car. As the child ran off and was rescued by a passing motorist, her mother was strangled and repeatedly stabbed in the head and chest, according to a 37-count indictment that includes a top count of first-degree murder. '(The mother) died really saving Jane Doe,' Fitzpatrick said at a news conference, using the standard name to identify the child, whose identity is not being revealed because of her age. The murdered mother’s name is also not being revealed in order to protect the identity of the girl. 'There's no question that she attempted to distract Renz so that little Jane could get away.' He said he will seek a sentence of life without parole if Renz is convicted. Prosecutors said the attack happened two or three weeks after Renz acquired cable ties and an air pistol they said was used to threaten the woman into stopping in a suburban Syracuse mall parking lot as she was leaving a gym class on the evening of March 14. Authorities said Renz had hours earlier removed and quickly reassembled an electronic bracelet so monitors didn't immediately realize he'd taken it off. He was ordered to wear the device as a condition for being released from jail after his arrest in January on federal child pornography charges. Perp walk: The attack happened two or three weeks after Renz acquired cable ties and an air pistol they said was used to threaten the woman into stopping in a suburban Syracuse mall parking lot . Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said some child porn Renz possessed included scenes similar to the attack on the mother and child. After stopping the car, Renz ordered the woman to drive to a remote part of the parking lot where he bound both victims' hands with cable ties and raped the child, Fitzpatrick said. Renz then drove them a short distance until the car got stuck in a snow bank, prosecutors said. It was there, they said, that he tried to restrain the mother and the child escaped, looking back to see her mother had gotten out of the car and was being chased by Renz. A passing motorist found the girl and alerted police who caught Renz nearby after a foot chase. Fitzpatrick said Renz had the woman's car keys and blood on his clothes matched that of the child. Suspect: David Renz, 29, has been charged with murder, rape and kidnapping in connection to a deadly carjacking or a woman and her daughter . Crime scene: New York State Police investigate a car involved in a fatal carjacking on Verplank Road, Clay, N.Y . Chief Assistant District Attorney Matthew Doran said a knife found on the snow nearby is being tested to determine if it was used to kill the mother. He said the air pistol hasn't been found. Renz has pleaded not guilty in both the federal and state cases. On Wednesday, a judge set a June 3 trial date for the federal child porn case. A federal grand jury indicted him last month on one count of receiving and five counts of possessing child pornography. An FBI investigation led to the charges that he downloaded the pornography featuring young girls over the course of two years and had five DVDs and CDs, according to the indictment. The state indictment handed up Wednesday includes multiple counts of murder, kidnapping, predatory sexual assault against a child, sexual abuse, menacing, weapon possession, and possessing a sexual performance by a child.","David Renz is charged with carjacking a mother and daughter in a Syracuse, New York parking lot .

"Students at Southern Methodist University in Dallas have described Professor Rick Halperin as brilliant and passionate about the cause of human rights, but according to a lawsuit filed by his former assistant, the respectable educator is a lecher obsessed with Nazis. Patricia Davis, the former associate director of Embrey Human Rights Program, sued SMU Tuesday, claiming that Halperin 'had inappropriate conduct towards women in his classes, including undergraduate and graduate students.' In her lawsuit, Davis accused SMU officials, including school president R. Gerald Turner, of failing to properly investigate her concerns regarding Halperin, who heads the Embrey program. Explosive allegations: Patricia Davis (left), former associate director of Embrey Human Rights Program, field a complaint accusing SMU of firing her for claiming that her boss, Rick Halperin (right) was harassing female students and had an obsession with Nazis . Bizarre claims: Davis said in her petition that Halperin, pictured here in his office in September 2008, is a Nazi fetishist who surrounds himself with posters displaying symbols of the Third Reich . The complaint cited by the Dallas Morning News states that Beth Wilson, the university's Title IX coordinator, told Davis she had 'found no evidence' of improper conduct on Halperin's part after looking into the allegations, but would not elaborate what led to that conclusion. Davis was fired from SMU a day after she had requested to appeal the decision. The termination letter stated that she was being let go 'due to false accusations of sexual harassment and to your disruptive and detrimental impact on Program operations and your poor working relationships with Program and other SMU staff.' In her federal wrongful termination petition, the formerly tenured theology professor says that Embrey staffers 'noticed that Halperin often had women in his office behind closed doors and at odd hours.' She goes on to claim that officials with the EHRP put a policy in place under which Halperin was not to be left alone with anyone in the program's suite after business hours, on weekends, or over holidays, 'and never behind closed doors.' However, the lawsuit alleges that the head of EHRP flouted the rule. In an odd twist, Davis also has accused her former superior of being obsessed with Nazis, privately giving the 'Heil Hitler' salute, displaying Nazi symbols in his office and 'watching hours and hours of pictures of bodies and Holocaust death camps on his office television.' Respected academic: According to his biography on SMU's website, Halperin joined the college in 1985 as an academic advisor and history teacher, and began teaching human rights courses in 1990 . The lawsuit further states that when Davis warned her boss about his questionable conduct after hearing complaints from students and staff, Halperin 'attacked her integrity' and allegedly threatened to have her fired should she blow the whistle on him. According to his biography on SMU's website, Halperin joined the Dallas college in 1985 as an academic adviser and history teacher, and began teaching human rights courses in 1990. For the past several years, Halperin has been leading groups of students and faculty on annual 10-day trips to Holocaust death camps in Poland 'in order to learn about and pay tribute to the men, women and children destroyed in the camps, and to honor those who survived the experience,' his SMU page states. Halperin, a George Washington University- and Sorbonne-educated professor, is highly regarded in the human rights community, taking part in UN monitoring delegations that inspected prison conditions in Ireland and El Salvador, and visiting Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza. SMU's campus newspaper The Daily Mustang reported in 2008 that Halperin served as chair of the Board of Directors of Amnesty International USA from 1992-1993 and then again from 2005-2007. For his humanitarian work, Halperin received the Amnesty International Frederick Douglass Abolitionist Award, among other honors. In 2005, SMU received an endowment from Lauren Embrey, the president and CEO of the philanthropic Embrey Family Foundation, to create the Embrey Human Rights Program, with Halperin at the helm. Bad behavior: Davis (left) claims that Halperin, highly regarded for his humanitarian work with the UN inspecting prisons, watched hours of Holocaust photos, yelled 'Achtung' on the phone and seduced female students . That same year, Davis said she first suspected her chief of engaging in inappropriate relations with his students while on a trip to Poland, Dallas Observer reported. Eight months later, Davis said in her petition that she walked into Halperin's office to find a female undergraduate 'kneeling behind Halperin's desk with him.' Seeing David, the student 'jumped up with a start. Both acted embarrassed ass if in a compromising situation, and [the student] ran out of the office.' In another incident that happened one evening in 2011, Davis said in her complaint that she walked in on a similar scene in the EHRP suite, with Halperin and a young woman who was with him looking embarrassed and stammering forced greetings.' Davis claims that even before the alleged encounters, her former boss had displayed odd behavior, admitting to her that he enjoyed running around his neighborhood naked and looking into strangers'  windows for fun - a hobby he referred to as 'steam-piping.' Also, the professor who has been touring Holocaust sites appeared to be a Nazi fetishist, yelling 'Achtung' on the phone and displaying huge posters of Nazi symbols in his office, the petition states. When asked to comment on the allegations, Halperin said that he has not seen the lawsuit, while SMU has declined to address Davis' claims. Meanwhile, Halperin's students created a Facebook group called 'We love Rick Halperin' in support of the beleaguered professor, calling him 'kind-hearted, understanding' and 'wise.' As of Wednesday evening, 270 people have joined the group in support of Halperin, with members calling accusations against him 'defamatory' and 'erroneous.'","Patricia Davis filed wrongful termination lawsuit against SMU accusing college of firing her for blowing the whistle on professor Rick Halperin .

"With the new Premier League season fast approaching, time is running out for managers everywhere to get their teams in order. With that in mind, Sportsmail poses the biggest questions facing England's top clubs right now. LIVERPOOL . Will Brendan Rodgers make one marquee signing with the £63m from the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona? Liverpool have missed out on Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, who has signed a new five-year contract with the Spanish giants. And Madrid could also upset Rodgers by signing another of his targets, Monaco hit-man Radamel Falcao. VIDEO Scroll Fernando Torres misses from two yards in Chelsea friendly . Transfer: With Luis Suarez sold and Adam Lallana out injured, will Lazar Markovic be enough for Liverpool? Rodgers, though, is not panicking. He is happy with the business done so far this summer and is more concerned with group harmony that signing one big-name player. He will hold onto some of the spare cash until the January transfer window. Of the new arrivals, much is expected of young Serbian winger Lazar Markovic, while £23m midfielder Adam Lallana will surely be influential once he shakes off a knee injury that will keep him out for the first few weeks of the season. Chelsea . Is Fernando Torres finally on his way out of Chelsea? The striker was part of the full-strength squad which flew out to Turkey on Friday, but that should not be taken as a sign he has a long-term future at Stamford Bridge. Valencia have been keen on the former Liverpool hit-man for a couple of years and now have the buying buyer of a new Singapore billionaire. Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid also want the 30-year-old Spaniard. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho undoubtedly want shut, but Torres does not feel the time is right to leave. There have been reports of a bust-up between the pair at the end of last season, but Torres still wants to stay and fight in the hope of proving the Portuguese wrong. Curtains: Is it time for Fernando Torres' ill-fated spell in west London to come to an end? Manchester United . Will United get a defender good enough to return them to top four? Louis van Gaal maybe disappointed in his failed bid to sign Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen. The 28-year-old defender has been cleared to leave Arsenal by Arsene Wenger, but will move to Barcelona instead. On first inspection, that may seem a blow to Van Gaal’s hopes of firing United back among the Premier League’s front runners in his first seasons in charge. But the Dutchman has been more than impressed by what he has seen of the defenders already at Old Trafford during United’s pre-season tour of America. They have responded to his change in tactics and jumped on board with his brutal new fitness regime. Defence: After losing out on Thomas Vermaelen, will Manchester United be strong enough at the back? And, the transfer window has not closed yet. Van Gaal may yet add Ajax full-back Daley Blind to his line-up and AS Roma centre-back Mehdi Benatia. Will Arturo Vidal be the longest-running transfer saga never to happen? There is every chance the midfielder will still be sitting in a barber’s chair somewhere in Italy when United kick-off the new campaign at home to Swansea. Juventus are desperate to sell the £45m-rated midfielder to help their cash-flow problems. But United are insisting no deal is on the cards. The Chilean had an operation on his knee before the start of the World Cup in Brazil and it is believed Louis van Gaal has fears over the 27-year-old’s long-term fitness. If a deal was done for a player who likes his hair trimmed a least once a week, Vidal would likely become United’s most expensive signing of all time. Limbo: Arturo Vidal's ongoing transfer saga has been a feature of Manchester United's summer . Manchester City . Will City have retained the Premier League title by the time they finally sign Eliaquim Mangala? It’s not quite “Where’s Wally?”, but not far off. It appears City have been saying they are about to sign the Porto defender within the next 48 hours for the last 48 weeks. It’s fast becoming a farce. And we thought those days were over at City. The 23-year-old Frenchman visited Manchester last month to ratify the deal and the video footage of his trip was embarrassingly leaked on the club's website. The hold-up is understood to be down to City and Porto ironing out the third party ownership of a the player. There is no truth in reports - yet - that Manuel Pellegrini has been seen searching kit skips and looking behind lockers for the player valued at around £32m. Champions: City are the Premier Leaguechampions, but are desperate to add Eliaquim Managala to their side . Arsenal . Will Arsene Wenger rush to sign a defensive midfielder in the final weeks of the transfer window or go with Jack Wilshire as holding player? Wenger has denied planning to use the England midfielder in a holding role for the season ahead, but could be fast running out of options. The Frenchman has dismissed reports linking him with a move for Real Madrid’s genuinely world-class German enforcer Sami Khedira. And the Gunners have yet to formally submit an offer to Sporting Lisbon’s William Carvalho. Arsenal’s move for Southampton’s Calum Chambers last week caught many by surprise and it has been suggested Wenger is considering turning the young defender into exactly the sort of midfielder he wants to fill his gap. Tussle: Does Jack Wilshere have what it takes to play as a holding midfielder, or should Wenger spend again? VIDEO Arteta expecting great season . West Ham United . Will Sam Allardyce finally get his hands on another striker or two before the drama starts all over again at West Ham? Allardyce has put bids in for four strikers, but actually only wants to sign two of them. Big Sam all over, maybe? Throw everything at it and hope something decent falls out? Andy Carroll has been ruled out until sometime in November with an ankle injury sustained on the club’s pre-season tour of New Zealand. The absence of the club-record signing in the front line has left Big Sam in a desperate hunt before the Hammers open with an all-London affair against Tottenham. West Ham have agreed a £3.5m fee with Metz for 24-year-old Senegalese striker Diafra Sakho but the personal terms are an issue. Allardyce could also set his sights on Arsenal’s versatile Costa Rican Joel Campbell and Manchester United’s likely outcast Wilfried Zaha. Issues: Andy Carroll has been plagued by fitness problems since signing for West Ham last summer . Southampton . Are Saints going to build a team that could avoid relegation? After having the heart of their side ripped out by Liverpool and Manchester United, there is simply not enough time for new manager Ronald Koeman to find the six or seven players needed to fully limit the damage. The signings of Italian target-man Grazianno Pelle and Serbian midfielder Dusan Tadic are a start, but it is hard to see how any club could service such a brutal dismantling of their squad and hope to survive in the top flight. Difficult task: Can Ronald Koeman keep Southampton up after they sold five of their best players . QPR . Will Brazilian glamour-boy Ronaldinho give Rangers the edge over the other relegation contenders? Harry Redknapp is never short of a big-name transfer target, or two. But Ronaldinho? According to reports, the 34-year-old is looking for a new club after his contract at Atletico Mineiro was terminated. It has been suggested Ronaldinho would be keen to link up with compatriot Julio Cesar at Rangers. All well and good, except the keeper is likely to be on his way if a del can be done over his wages. Ronaldinho, apparently, sees himself playing on for another eight years. The former Barcelona legend could do a job for newly-promoted Rangers, but Redknapp is not fool enough to place Ranges’ survival hopes on his shoulders. London bound: Could Harry Redknapp pull off another coup and snag former Barcelona star Ronaldinho? Burnley . Will Clarets’ boss Sean Dyche finally land West Brom defender Craig Dawson in time for the inevitable relegation battle? The Baggies have rejected a third bid from Burnley for the former England Under 21 international. Dyche has made the 24-year-old one of his top targets as he tried to build a squad capable of staying in the Premier League, but will need to up his last offer of just over £2m. Burnley, not surprisingly, are tipped by many to stop straight back into the Championship. Dyche was happy a squad which romped to automatic promotion last season, but he does not appear to have done enough business this summer to keep the Clarets in the top flight. It could all go very wrong, very quickly. Baggies: Can Burnley finally sign West Brom defender Craig Dawson as Dyche looks to strengthen defence .

"Athletic Bilbao are persevering with their interest in Arsenal's Mikel Arteta and Nacho Monreal. Arteta has made it clear he wants to stick it out at Arsenal but Monreal may consider what is on offer back in Spain. Both Spaniards featured in the team which were beaten 1-0 by Monaco in the Emirates Cup on Sunday with Artera captaining the side. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arteta expecting great season . Keen to stay: Mikel Arteta is not looking to leave Arsenal despite the interest from Athletic Bilbao . Arteta moved to Arsenal from Everton in August 2011 for a fee of £10million having previously had spells at Rangers and Real Sociedad. Monreal, meanwhile, moved to the Emirates from Malaga in January 2013. Arsenal remain in the hunt for another holding midfielder although Jack Wilshere could also be used there. Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho is available as his club want to cash in now at £24m but Morgan Schneiderlin is expected to go to Tottenham. Heading home? Nacho Monreal could have been tempted by a return to Spain . Real Madrid say they have yet to receive a bid for Sami Khedira but won't let him leave for free next summer. The German is due to return to training at Madrid tomorrow and will hold talks over his future. The added attraction with Sporting's Carvalho is that he is understood to be on wages of around £10,000 a week, although his agent would obviously push for a hefty rise.

"Zenit St Petersburg and Porto both put a foot in the Champions League group stage with 1-0 away wins in the first leg of their respective play-off ties on Wednesday. Oleg Shatov's first-half goal gave Andre Villas-Boas' Zenit a 1-0 win at Standard Liege and a second-half effort from Hector Herrera was enough for the Portuguese coach's former team Porto at Lille.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch All to play for after Lille-Porto first leg . Crunch: Standard Liege midfielder Ricardo Faty slides into Zenith St Petersburg's Hulk . Zenit's goal in the 16th minute was a superb team effort, beginning when Domenico Criscito sent a clever pass into the path of Danny. The Portuguese player chested the ball down for Hulk and the Brazilian picked out Shatov who side-footed home from near the penalty spot. Danny and Jose Rondon both struck the woodwork in a dominant Zenit performance . Porto, who have only missed out on the group stage four times since it started in 1992, took control of their tie when Mexico forward Herrera stabbed in from close range in the 61st minute after Vincent Enyeama had parried Jackson Martinez's header. Group hug: Zenith celebrate after scoring the only goal against Standard Liege . 'We played a very serious game, against very serious and difficult opponents,' said Porto coach Julen Lopetegui. 'We had more than enough chances to guarantee the result and now we have to continue working to make sure of a game result in the second leg.' Slovan Bratislava gifted BATE the lead just before halftime when defender Thomas Jablonsky turned Sergei Krivets' looping cross past his own goalkeeper.

"The world's oldest human DNA has been recovered from the thigh bone of an ancestor that walked the Earth 400,000 years ago. It belonged to a hominin, or early human, known as Homo heidelbergensis and provides a new vital piece of the jigsaw in the story of evolution. Using a technique for retrieving and sequencing highly degraded ancient DNA, scientists were able to reconstruct the almost complete mitochondrial (mt) genome from just two grams of bone powder. The world's oldest human DNA has been recovered from the thigh bone of an ancestor that walked the Earth 400,000 years ago . The findings, published in Nature, are unexpected because as early hominins looked a bit like Neanderthals, their mtDNA was expected to share a common ancestor. But the creature dug up in an underground cave in northern Spain known as the 'Pit of Bones' was found to share a common ancestor with the Neanderthals' mysterious Asian sister group, the Denisovans, dating back about 700,000 years. From the missing mutations in the old DNA sequences the researchers were able to calculate when the 'Pit of Bones' hominin lived. The Sima de los Huesos hominins lived approximately 400,000 years ago during the Middle Pleistocene . The DNA was recovered from a 400,000-year-old thigh bone dug up  in an underground cave in northern Spain known as the 'Pit of Bones'. The Pit of Bones a 12-meter deep vertical shaft which turns into an inclined passage 10 meters in length opening onto a chamber measuring 15 square meters. The cave at the Atapuerca Mountains, or 'Sima de los Huesos' in Spanish, has already yielded the world's biggest collection of Middle Pleistocene fossils. Aa total of 28 skeletons, so further DNA extractions may be possible. Mitochondrial DNA can only be passed from a mother to her children and produces the power plants of cells. Evolutionary anthropologist Dr Matthias Meyer, of the Max Planck Institute, Leipzig, Germany, said: 'The fact the mtDNA of the hominin shares a common ancestor with Denisovan rather than Neanderthal mtDNAs is unexpected since its skeletal remains carry Neanderthal derived features.' Considering their age and Neanderthal like features, the H heidelbergensis was likely related to both Neanderthals and Denisovans. Another possibility is gene flow from yet another group of hominins brought the Denisovan mtDNA into the 'Pit of Bones' hominins or their ancestors. DNA this old has until recently been retrieved only from the permafrost. The study pushes our understanding of the genetics of human evolution some 200,000 years further back from the Late to the Middle Pleistocene. The cave at Sierra de Atapuerca, 'Sima de los Huesos' in Spanish, has already yielded the world's biggest collection of Middle Pleistocene fossils, a total of 28 skeletons, so further DNA extractions may be possible. They have been excavated and pieced together over the course of more than two decades by a Spanish team of paleontologists led by Juan-Luis Arsuaga. The fossils are classified as H heidelbergensis but also carry traits typical of Neanderthals. Until now it had not been possible to study the DNA of these unique hominins. Pictured is the skeleton of a Homo heidelbergensis from Sima de los Huesos, a unique cave site in Spain . Dr Meyer's team first joined forces with palaeontologist Professor Juan-Luis Arsuaga, of the Complutense University of Madrid, to apply his technique to a cave bear dug up at the 'Pit of Bones' which came along 100,000 years later, about 300,000 years ago. After this success, the researchers sampled the hominin thigh bone from the cave. They extracted its DNA and sequenced the genome of mtDNA and then compared the ancient material with Neanderthals, Denisovans, modern humans and apes. Professor Svante Paabo, director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, said: 'Our results show we can now study DNA from human ancestors hundreds of thousands of years old. This opens prospects to study the genes of the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans. 'It is tremendously exciting.' H. heidelbergensis was first discovered near Heidelberg, Germany, in 1907 and lived in Africa, Europe and western Asia and may date back up to 1,300,000 years before dying out about 250,000 years ago. Males grew around 5ft 9in tall and females 5ft 2in. Little is known about the Denisovans because only a finger bone and some teeth have been found but they are believed to have been widespread in Siberia and Asia, and may have been interbreeding with humans as recently as 50,000 years ago. Professor Arsuaga added: 'This unexpected result points to a complex pattern of evolution in the origin of Neanderthals and modern humans. I hope more research will help clarify the genetic relationships of the hominins from Sima de los Huesos to Neanderthals and Denisovans.' The researchers are now pursuing this goal by focusing on retrieving DNA from more individuals from the site and also nuclear DNA at the cell's centre which drives an organism's biochemistry.","Scientist reconstructed the mitochondrial genome from two grams of bone .

"A woman who forced her fiancé to take a lie detector test to prove he has been faithful every time he left the house has married him. Debbie Wood, 43, from Leicester was so afraid her boyfriend, now husband, Steve Wood, 31, would stray she even combed his phone, email accounts and bank statements for signs of infidelity several times a day. But she has now put her fears to one side and married Mr Wood in a Halloween ceremony. Scroll down for video . Wedded bliss: Debbie Wood, 43, who was so paranoid that her fiancé Steve Wood, 31, would cheat on her that she forced him to take lie detector tests every time he left the house has married him . Newlyweds: The couple started dating in 2011 after they met on Facebook through a friend . Mrs Wood wore a white gown with lace and diamante detail, topped with a tara, while her groom sported a smart grey suit. Shortly before saying 'I do', Mr Wood expressed his excitement over the couple's big day on his Facebook page. He wrote: 'So... The next time I post something on here i will be doing so as a married man.... Who'd have thought eh?? Thanks to EVERYONE who has been with me on this journey of life up to now (too many to mention) and thank you to the amazing woman who in just a couple of hours from now will be my wife... Love you babe and thank you.' Mrs Wood, who changed her name to match her fiancé's before the couple wed, also changed her online status to reflect their marriage, and wrote: 'I love you toi husband xx (sic).' Rare condition: Mrs Wood has been diagnosed with Othello Syndrome, that causes delusional jealousy . Fear: Mrs Wood set childproof filters on Mr Wood's computer to stop him accessing websites carrying pictures of sexy women . Mr and Mrs Wood made headlines last year after she was diagnosed with a rare condition, Othello Syndrome, that causes delusional jealousy. She had even banned him from  watching women on television or looking at pictures of them in magazines. ‘I . think he’s gorgeous, but that’s not the issue - it’s about whether or . not I can trust him not to look at other women while he is out on his . own,' she had said. ‘I don’t want him thinking they’re . hot. If you’re in a relationship and you’re happy with your partner, you . should only have eyes for that person.’ The couple started dating in 2011 after they met through a friend. Mrs Wood had spent ten years living in the U.S. but moved back to Britain four years ago after another long-term relationship broke down. Remote control: Mrs Wood had banned her fiancé from watching any television programmes featuring women, even programmes such as The Weakest Link . Testing times: She bought the lie detector online, saying it was the only way she could be sure Mr Wood's eyes had not been wandering and he was telling the truth . She was so heartbroken . that she vowed to never get into another relationship - and experts . believe the emotional trauma triggered her illness. Mrs Wood was living in her native Scotland when a mutual friend introduced her to Mr Wood on Facebook a year later. After exchanging messages for several weeks, she travelled to London where the pair enjoyed their first date. She said: ‘I knew we were meant to be a couple when we shared our first kiss under London Bridge. I didn’t mean to fall in love again after my last relationship but Steve stole my heart. 'Soulmates': Mr and Mrs Wood were introduced to each other via a mutual friend on Facebook . ‘The only problem was that we lived so far apart. We started to get serious and made plans to move in together but I then discovered that Steve had been seeing another girl around the time we’d first met. ‘He claimed he didn’t think we were exclusive because of the distance and I forgave him but I started to doubt whether or not he could be faithful.’ Mrs Wood, who also suffers from bipolar and body dysmorphic disorders, added that her jealousy got worse when the pair moved in together as she tried to monitor Mr Wood’s every move. She installed child-proof filters on his laptop and mobile phone to stop him looking at explicit pictures of women and banned him from watching any television programmes featuring women, even programmes such as The Weakest Link. ‘One night, an advert . for a women’s razor came on television and I felt panicky thinking that . Steve was eyeing the model up,' she said. Suspicious: Othello, played here by actor Lenny Henry . Othello Syndrome is a psychiatric disorder where a person is convinced their partner is being unfaithful - but with very little, if any, proof to confirm their fears. The name is derived from Shakespeare’s Othello, who killed his wife Desdemona after suspecting her infidelity. The condition presents itself as jealous and controlling behaviour and sometimes violence - but the two main characteristics are delusions and obsessions. In men the jealousy tends to focus around sexual infidelity, whereas in women it may centre around emotional betrayal. Treatment includes antidepressant and antipsychotic medication and/or therapy. It is not known how common the syndrome is but one study suggests the average onset is at age 68 and with 62 per cent of sufferers male. 'The only thing that could put my mind at rest was banning him from watching any programmes that have women in them. ‘Now, I won’t even let him watch The Weakest Link in case he fancies Anne Robinson but I’m scared he’ll have a sneaky look when I’m in another room. ‘That’s why I decided to order the lie detector online. It was my only way of knowing for sure if Steve’s eyes were wandering. In general, he’s quite truthful but I have caught him lying a few times about looking at other women.’ Mrs Wood was diagnosed with Othello Syndrome last September, with the condition affecting her so badly that she could barely leave the house. She was prescribed anti-anxiety medication and also underwent therapy to deal with her issues, hoping to marry Mr Wood after her treatment. The name of the condition is derived from . the play by William Shakespeare, in which the character of Othello . murders his wife Desdemona after suspecting infidelity. Research suggests around 15 per cent of . sufferers have been violent towards their partners, including . 63-year-old Robert Mercati, who killed his wife Margaret at their home . earlier this year after being diagnosed with the condition. Mr Mercati, of Bloomsbury, central . London, who then took his own life, had installed electric bugs around . the marital home after becoming convinced his wife, also 63, had been . unfaithful. Mrs Wood said: ‘My jealousy has driven me to breaking point and sometimes I’ve thrown stuff across the room. ‘I put Steve through a lot but he’s stood by me through it all so I know he’s the man for me. I think lots of women out there must be suffering from the same condition and just not realise it. ‘I think it’s because of the pressure society puts on us to look a certain way - to be stick thin with blonde hair and big boobs. I’m lucky my partner is so understanding - others might not be so fortunate.’ Mr Wood admitted life with his partner could be tough - but insisted she was worth it. He said: ‘Sometimes, I get nervous and the lie detector test results come back inconclusive because my heart is hammering, which makes Debbi doubt me. I just have to tell her I haven’t cheated and pray she believes me. 'I’m willing to put up with it, because I know we’re soulmates. She’s so special to me and a bit of jealousy here and there won’t change that.’","Debbi Wood, 43, married husband Steve, 31, in a ceremony on Halloween .

"Authorities say former NFL quarterback Max Hall has been accused of shoplifting and narcotics possession near his Arizona hometown. Gilbert police say the 28-year-old Hall, who played for the Arizona Cardinals before being dropped after the 2010 season, was arrested Friday for allegedly shoplifting from a Best Buy store in Gilbert. The ex-Brigham Young University quarterback was wearing his BYU jersey when he was arrested and found to have needles, a metal spoon, a lighter and a pill bottle filled with cocaine on his person as well as several items stolen from the Best Buy and a nearby Walmart. Downfall: The once-promising footballer Max Hall was arrested for shoplifting and was found to be in possession of cocaine and hypodermic needles . The Mormon university, which aims to 'assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life,' requires that students abstain from drugs, alcohol and tobacco, among other things. 'I'm really sorry, I'll pay for the stuff. If I get arrested, I'll get fired. I've never done this before,' Hall is quoted as saying in the arrest report. Officers say they searched Hall's backpack and found several stolen items including cell phone cases and phone chargers along with a 'personal-use quantity of cocaine.' According to the Deseret News, he told police that he had injected himself with cocaine that morning. Police say Hall was released shortly after his arrest. It was unclear Tuesday if he has obtained a lawyer. Hall, who grew up in Mesa, played college football at Arizona State and BYU before being signed as an undrafted free agent by the Arizona Cardinals. Spiral: Hall began his career at Arizona State and BYU. After playing six games for the Cardinals in 2011, he was released with an injury. He was an assistant coach at BYU in 2012, then played for the Winnipeg Bombers in 2013 but was released before the 2014 season . Young father: Hall is married to McKinzi Gissel Hall and the couple have two young children together . 'Max Hall in many ways epitomized growing up as a young boy, what you want to become,' said broadcaster said Kevin Ray. He played in six games for the Cardinals in 2010 and then played with the Canadian Football League's Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 2013. In 2012, he worked as an assistant coach for Brigham Young University. He is the married father of two young children. News of the arrest stunned BYU fans and the wider football community, which took to social media to express their shock and sadness, although others were less sympathetic. 'No secret I'm not a BYU fan but Max Hall's situation is beyond any rivalry. Always was a good guy to me. Hope he gets out of this dark place,' wrote Chargers' quarterback Ryan Lindley. 'Relax, cougar fans.

"A 400-pound woman who fell through a New York sidewalk claims that  her size actually came to her rescue and that a slimmer woman may not have survived the accident. Ulanda Williams, 32, of Queens, was attempting to shelter from the rain outside a restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side on Friday night when the ground collapsed beneath her. The six-foot-five woman fell about seven feet into a hollow basement, breaking her arm in two places and had to be rescued by the fire department with a crane. Scroll down for video .

Noah is thought to cost in the region of £75million and is due for release in America on March 29 . Aronofsky's film, based around the story of Noah’s Ark from The Book Of . Genesis, has already gained a fair amount of criticism. Agnostic US TV host Bill Maher slammed the movie for a perceived lack of ‘plausibility.’ Russell Crowe takes the lead in the new film based on the tale of Noah from The Book of Genesis . 'But the thing that’s really disturbing about Noah isn’t the silly, it’s that it’s immoral,’ he said. 'It’s about a psychotic mass murderer who gets away with it, and his name is God.' Noah is also thought to be banned in several countries for depicting religious characters, with censorship boards in Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates informing distributor Paramount that they won’t be releasing the film. The actor takes his seat during a press conference ahead of the film's US release at the end of the month. The epic has been banned in several countries for depicting religious characters . Speaking of his latest role, the actor recently claimed his depiction of Noah will go against the grain of common belief regarding his character.

"Harlequins survived having two men sent to the sin bin to record an unconvincing win over London Irish in an ill-tempered affair which failed to live up to the earlier offering at Twickenham. Following the nail-biter between Saracens and Wasps, this match was always going to struggle to hit the same heights and it was no surprise it turned into a niggly contest between two sides likely to finish the season at opposing ends of the table. Harlequins, beaten semi-finalists last season, lost Joe Marler and Kyle Sinckler to the sin bin in the second half to allow Exiles fly-half Shane Geraghty to keep the pressure on with five penalties. Hand-off: Harlequins winger Ollie Lindsay-Hague fights off the attention of London Irish's Topsy Ojo . Try: Topsy Ojo's attempted tackle wasn't enough as Lindsay-Hague left scored for Harlequins . Game of two halves: Harlequins were excellent in the first half and terrible in the second . But despite the second-half absence of their props for 10 minutes apiece - both dismissed for high tackles on hooker David Paice - Conor O’Shea’s men always had their noses in front after winger Ugo Monye scored the only try of the game after 10 minutes. ‘It was frustrating,’ said Quins No 8 Nick Easter. ‘We allowed them to be niggly at the breakdown and didn’t deal with it ourselves. We need to be much better than that.’ Fly-half Nick Evans endured a poor day with the boot but still kicked 15 points while Ollie Lindsay-Hague scored Quins’ other try in an otherwise disappointing game. London Irish also had Eamonn Sheridan sent to the sin bin in the first half. Quins had dominated the first half with tries from Ugo Monye and replacement Ollie Lindsay-Hague and two conversions and two penalties from Evans, who could have made the win more comfortable were it not for three simple misses. First half: London Irish endured a disappointing first half, and fund themselves losing 20-6 at the break . Opener: Harlequins were quick out of the blocks in their Aviva Premiership opener at Twickenham . Some excellent goal-kicking from Shane Geraghty saw him succeed with five penalties but crucially Irish failed to score a try when Quins were down to 13 men. A late penalty from Evans saw the visitors home. England wing Marland Yarde was the only new name in the Quins line-up as he faced his old club. Marler led the side, having taken over the club captaincy from Chris Robshaw. In contrast, Irish had some fresh faces with former Harlequin Tom Guest, Tom Court and Samoan Dan Leo all featuring in the pack. In the third minute, Quins had the first chance for points but Evans surprisingly missed a straightforward penalty attempt before Irish suffered two blows in quick succession. First, Irish full back Tom Homer limped off to be replaced by Tom Fowlie before Evans give his side the lead by kicking a more difficult penalty. Dangerous: Harlequins' new captain Joe Marler was sent to the sin bin after a dangerous tackle . Points: Shane Geraghty scored five penalties for the Exiles but it wasn't enough to complete the comeback . Irish were starved of possession in the opening 10 minutes and inevitably Quins made them pay. Charlie Matthews won a line-out before a clever flick-on by Mike Brown sent Monye flying into the corner for a try which Evans converted with a splendid kick. It was proving to be a mixed bag on the kicking front for Evans as moments later he failed with a routine penalty so, despite totally dominating the opening quarter, Quins only led 10-0 at the end of it. The concession of a number of penalties by the Quins allowed Irish their first foothold in the game and they were rewarded with their first points when Geraghty fired over a long-range penalty. This proved to be only a temporary respite for the Irish as once again they suffered two setbacks in quick succession. Centre Eamonn Sheridan was sin-binned for a deliberate offside and from the resulting penalty, Evans made no mistake. Yellow: Kyle Snickler (right) was shown the yellow card shortly after Joe Marler to reduce Quins to nine men . Twickenham: Mike Brown is tackled by London Irish's David Plaice during their Premiership game . Quins also lost a player through injury when Monye departed to be replaced by Lindsay-Hague before Matthews gave away a foolish penalty, which Geraghty kicked to briefly keep Irish in contention before Quins struck again. They moved the ball wide allowing Nick Easter to feed Lindsay-Hague. The wing had little space in which to move but he easily evaded a dreadful attempt at a tackle from Topsy Ojo to score Quins' second try, which Evans converted for a healthy 20-6 interval lead. Early in the second half, Marlar collected a yellow card for a tip tackle on David Paice, enabling Geraghty to kick his third penalty and, minutes later, Quins were down to 13 men when Sinckler was sin-binned for a high tackle on Paice. Marlar returned in time to see Geraghty kick another penalty but Irish could not capitalise as Quins were restored to 15 men with no further damage done. Geraghty was again on target to reduce the arrears to five points but Irish could make no further inroads and Quins held on.","Harlequins beat London Irish 20-15 at Twickenham .

"On Saturday afternoon, with the sun a-glow and the pitch pristine, India moved without too much fuss in their second innings to 53 for one. The remnants of Hurricane Bertha were set to wipe out the fourth day and possibly the fifth. Stuart Broad was in hospital with a broken nose; Jimmy Anderson was struggling with a bug. Survive until stumps, and there was a chance India would have arrived at The Oval this week at 1-1. What followed was the kind of surrender that gives white flags a bad name. Nine wickets fell in 22 overs – six of them to Moeen Ali and Chris Jordan – and the captain was out slogging to midwicket. MS Dhoni, you see: cool in a crisis. Irresponsible: MS Dhoni (left) can only watch as Gary Ballance catches his attempted slog at midwicket . For India, bowled out twice in the equivalent of a day’s play, there was worse to come. Talking to Mike Atherton, Dhoni insisted he was ‘quite happy’ with his team’s ‘progress’. There is sticking up for your players in public, and there is taking the mick. Dhoni didn’t merely cross that line: he jumped the shark. That evening, on Sky’s Verdict show, Ravi Shastri unwittingly revealed one of India’s biggest problems. Instead of taking Dhoni to task, Shastri – a veteran defender of India’s cricket establishment – suggested the captain had simply wanted to escape the interview as quickly as possible. As anyone who has sat through a Dhoni press conference will know, brevity is not his greatest strength. Not for the first time in India’s long sequence of overseas failures under Dhoni – the win at Lord’s was the notable exception – he was being given an armchair ride. Since the euphoria of that victory, a result that seems to have used up their entire stock of emotional energy, India have – to adapt Shane Warne’s assessment of Sachin Tendulkar – been third-best in this series, behind England and daylight. At Southampton and Manchester, they have scored 821 runs for the loss of 40 wickets; England have managed 1,141 runs – in one innings fewer – for the loss of 21 wickets (or 20, if you don’t count Broad’s nasal issues). In other words, India have averaged 20 per wicket to England’s 57. It has become 2011 all over again. Taking the mick: Dhoni trudges off after his irresponsible dismissal (left) then insisted he was happy with India . VIDEO India problems have been addressed - Dhoni . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . India’s chopping and changing hasn’t helped: England would still rather come up against Gautam Gambhir than Shikhar Dhawan, and the tourists are yet to pick the right bowling combination. Ravindra Jadeja (this summer averaging 22 with the bat and 46 with the ball) appears to owe his selection to the friends he has in high places. And they have come up against an England side that has finally woken up to a few harsh truths after sleep-walking through the first half of the season. Increasingly, the slip catch put down by Jadeja to reprieve Alastair Cook on 15 during the opening session at the Ageas Bowl looks like the turning point of the series – and perhaps, who knows, of a career. Cook made 95, the mood in the dressing-room lifted in homage to a popular captain, and India almost instantly went on the defensive. Cult-hero status for Pankaj Singh is no consolation. It's all over: Pankaj Singh was comprehensively bowled by Chris Jordan to seal victory for England . Pair of aces: James Anderson and Stuart Broad are becoming an all-time great double act . Since then, England have just got on with it. One of their smartest decisions was to insulate the players from the Anderson-Jadeja spat. Cricket was the thing, not a waste-of-money inquest. The Indians, by contrast, wouldn’t let it go: Dhoni was still expounding at length on the matter on the eve of the Old Trafford Test. It would be too facile to say that India have lost two Tests because they were distracted. Equally, they spent too much time nursing a sense of injustice beyond its proper proportion. As the driving force behind the decision to pursue Anderson, Dhoni has to bear the blame. While India fiddled, England fired. Handed a pair of pitches replete with pace and carry, their big names enjoyed themselves. In the last two Tests, Anderson has picked up 12 wickets at 11, Broad nine at 12. Their combined analysis has been 114.5-41-254-21. They are edging into the category of an all-time great double act. Ian Bell has responded with a sublime 167, a selfless 23 and a classy 58. And Joe Root is starting to bat as if determined to cast himself as a responsibility-bearing senior. There remain issues, of course, and India’s hopelessness has put a gloss on much of what England have done. Chris Woakes and Jordan have claimed four wickets between them at 84 each (and leaked 3.61 an over), while Sam Robson is one Test away from the axe. But England are rebuilding: what did we expect? Better, perhaps, to dwell on another trio. For Gary Ballance, Moeen (the off-spinner rather than the batsman, for the time being at least) and Jos Buttler, Test cricket must feel like a ball. Misery-guts are wondering whether they’ll be able to prosper next year against Mitchell Johnson. After the winter from hell, England will settle for the shoots of spring. Now that’s progress. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . Taking action . One by one, they are being picked off. Back in May, the Top Spin – acting on a tip-off – asked the ICC whether it was ‘right that the actions of several bowlers during the recent World Twenty20 were a concern?’ and whether those bowlers were ‘now being watched closely?’ We were fobbed off with an answer about the fact that no new instructions had been issued to match officials concerning the reporting of illegal actions. Which didn’t really help. Events since then have explained the evasion. Last month both Sri Lanka’s Sachithra Senanayake and New Zealand’s Kane Williamson were banned; now it’s Pakistan’s Saeed Ajmal. All three are off-spinners with a noticeable kink in their action. Since the ICC’s 15-degree rule was brought in because that was said to be the level of flexion visible to the naked eye, it seems due process is being followed. Elbowing in: Saeed Ajmal (right) has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action . Conspiracy theorists will note that the umpires who reported Ajmal on the fourth day of the Galle Test against Sri Lanka were Ian Gould and Bruce Oxenford, an Englishman and an Australian – and thus, in many Asian eyes, representatives of the old, white world order. Others will wonder how it took the authorities so long. Either way, the game has finally got serious about elbows which are straightening at the point of delivery. And if you think that’s a conspiracy, you need to get out more. Only Bradman better . Don Bradman averaged a handy 101 in his 24 Tests as captain. But, for once, he may be shifting uncomfortably in his grave. Angelo Mathews’ double of 91 and 25* as Sri Lanka pinched the Galle Test against Pakistan on Sunday seconds before the heavens opened took his record while captain to 1,304 runs at an average of nearly 87 – compared with a pre-captaincy figure of under 40. Only Bradman lies ahead of him. So much for the burdens of office. Becoming the Don: Angelo Mathews has a superb batting average as captain of Sri Lanka . Provincial angst . With three Tests out of seven each summer all but allocated to the London venues for the foreseeable future, the scramble is on among the UK’s seven other Test grounds to stage matches and recoup the millions of pounds the ECB encouraged them to spend on upgrades several years ago – precisely so that they were in a position to hold games which are now increasingly hard to come by. So it’s a pity the non-London venues have all encountered mishaps this summer. Headingley was always going to struggle to sell tickets against Sri Lanka. The Trent Bridge pitch was rated poor by the ICC. The Ageas Bowl felt half-empty after the opening day. And Old Trafford has a drainage issue. Perhaps the biggest winners have been Edgbaston, Cardiff and Chester-le-Street. Putting a dampner on things: The drainage issue at Old Trafford that wiped out the rest of day two . A question of consistency . Cricket Australia has removed from its website a video gleefully detailing the mistakes made by Matt Prior before England replaced him with Jos Buttler. The ECB were said to be unhappy with the tone of the video, but the reason given for its removal was copyright. Still, the thought occurred to one wag on Twitter: will CA now run a montage of MS Dhoni’s blunders behind the stumps this summer? Thought not.","England bowled India out twice in the equivalent of a day's play .

"The neighbourhood watch captain who shot dead an unarmed black teenager last month wanted to be a police officer and called 911 nearly 50 times within the last year, according to new reports. No charges have been filed in the February death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, shot in a gated community near Orlando by self-appointed watchman George Zimmerman, 28. Zimmerman, who admitted to shooting the teen, said he fired in self-defense and has not been arrested in the case. Scroll down for video . Target: Trayvon Martin, 17, left, was killed by George Zimmerman, 28, right, after the neighborhood watch captain pursued him as walked in a gated community . According to the Miami Herald, . Zimmerman volunteered as chief watchman at the Retreat of Twin Lakes . Townhomes after its homeowners association decided to jumpstart the . programme following a spate of burglaries. Licensed to carry a concealed firearm . and a student of criminal justice, neighbours told the newspaper . Zimmerman took nightly patrols while walking his dog, and was passionate . about his duty. Records acquired by the Herald show his self-appointment led to a series of calls to police. From January 1, 2011 to . February 26, 2012, Zimmerman reportedly phoned authorities 46 times - to . 'report disturbances, break-ins, windows left open and other . incidents'. His calls account for some of the 402 made to police from the 260-unit complex, according to the Herald. Cynthia Wibker, secretary of the homeowners association, credits him with solving crime in the area. 'He once caught a thief and an arrest was made,' she said, adding that he helped to solve 'a lot' of crimes. But Trayvon’s family attorney, Natalie Jackson, told the newspaper Zimmerman took his new position too seriously. Tragic: By the time police officers arrived, unarmed Trayvon, who had been carrying Skittles and soda, was dead on the ground from a single gunshot . 'Zimmerman felt he was one of them; he felt he was a cop,' she said. Sanford police officials, who have not . charged Zimmerman after accepting his claim that his actions were in . self-defense, released eight 911 calls on Friday after mounting . pressure. 'Zimmerman felt he was one of them; he felt he was a cop.' - Natalie Jackson, Martin family attorney . Zimmerman had called 911 to report a . suspicious man and can be heard pursuing Trayvon on foot against the . dispatcher's advice causing the teen to run away. Moments later the police are bombarded . with calls from terrified neighbours as a voice in the background can . be heard desperately screaming for help before the sound of two gun . shots. When police arrived at Twin Lakes they . found Trayvon, who had been returning from a store with candy for his . younger brother, had been shot dead by Zimmerman. 'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his SUV. Grieving: The teenager's mother Sabrina Fulton, centre, and father Tracy Martin, left, are said to be devastated after hearing the 911 calls of their son's last moments . Fighting for justice: Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump said 911 calls show the teenager spent the last few moments of his life terrified - and says Zimmerman should be charged . He added that the black teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes. 'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman said. During Zimmerman's initial call, he . told the dispatcher he was following Martin and the dispatcher told him, . 'You don't need to do that.' 'We’re hoping this doesn’t happen . again to another family, and that America opens their eyes ... even . though this won’t bring Trayvon back. We don’t want there to be another . Trayvon.' - Tracy Martin, victim's father . But Zimmerman sounds as if he continues to pursue the teen saying: 'He ran.' He then refuses to meet police . officers at an agreed location and asks for them to call him on arrival . instead so he can tell them where he is. Moments after Zimmerman's initial . call, dispatchers were bombarded by seven 911 calls from frantic . neighbors describing a fight between two men, screaming and then a . gunshot. 'There is somebody screaming outside,' one female caller said, as an unknown male voice can be heard crying in . the background. Then a shot is heard. A male caller described a physical altercation between Martin and the shooter. 'I just heard a shot right behind my . house,' The caller said. 'They're wrestling right behind my porch. The . guy is yelling 'Help.' I'm not going outside.' Scene: Martin was visiting his father and stepmother in Sanford where they live at The Retreat at Twin Lakes, pictured, when he went out to buy snacks for his younger brother . By the time police officers arrived, . unarmed Trayvon, who had been carrying Skittles and soda, was dead on . the ground from a single gunshot . Another woman said a man in a 'white top' was on top Trayvon. Martin's family had demanded the . release of the calls to help better understand how Martin died while . walking home from a convenience store. 'We are committed to having somebody . review this to see if we made a mistake. If we made missteps and there is something there, we will act . accordingly.' - Sanford Mayor Jeff . Triplett . 'He was yelling for help, and no one . could help him. He saw his life being taken away from him,'  the teen's . father Tracy Martin said. He said they will continue pushing for charges to be filed against Zimmerman. 'We’re hoping this doesn’t happen . again to another family, and that America opens their eyes... even . though this won’t bring Trayvon back. We don’t want there to be another . Trayvon,'  Mr Martin said. After listening to recordings of 911 . calls, Martin's family said they're more convinced than ever that the . Zimmerman should be charged with a crime. 'You hear a shot, a clear shot, then . you hear a 17-year-old boy begging for his life,' Ms Jackson said. 'Then . you hear a second shot.' The case has been turned over to the . State Attorney's Office which can decide whether to file charges or . present evidence to a grand jury. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is also . representing the family, told reporters outside Sanford City Hall that . Martin's parents both broke down and cried as they listened to the . recordings. 'They are completely devastated, and . they are in unbelievable grief,' Crump said. 'The last seconds of his . life were in absolute fear.' He added that a third witness has come forward saying it was the boy who was crying for help. Trayvon's . parents, Mr Martin and Ms Sybrina Fulton, previously sued to have the . recordings released. A hearing for the case had been scheduled for . Monday. Earlier on Friday, Trayvon's parents called on the FBI to take over the investigation, saying they no longer trusted the Sanford police department. Happier times: Trayvon's family believes Zimmerman should be charged and brought to justice for shooting their young son . Sanford police Sergeant David . Morgenstern said the department stands by its investigation but welcomes . help from any outside agency. FBI agent David Couvertier said the . agency has been in contact with Sanford police and is monitoring the . case. 'We are committed to having somebody . review this to see if we made a mistake,' said Sanford Mayor Jeff . Triplett. 'If we made missteps and there is something there, we will act . accordingly' Trayvon's family believe Zimmerman should be charged and brought to justice for shooting their young son . Several Sanford residents who spoke to . The Associated Press said they think there would have been an arrest . already if the shooter had been black and the deceased had been white. They said blacks and whites in this . city of 53,000 residents were pretty much in agreement that an injustice . had been done with no one arrested, and that there was no racial divide . in how the case is being perceived. The city is 57 percent white and 30 . percent black. Zimmerman's father delivered a letter . to the Orlando Sentinel on Thursday, saying the way his son is being . depicted in the media is cruel and misleading. He also says his son has received . death threats and moved out of his home. George Zimmerman is Hispanic . and grew up in a multiracial family, the statement says.

"AC Milan is the right move for Torres . Fernando Torres arrived in Milan ahead of his two-year loan move from Chelsea. The Spanish striker was pictured at Milan Linate Airport on Saturday and will undergo a medical before completing his Serie A switch. The 30-year-old replaces Mario Balotelli as Milan's lead striker following the Italian's £16million transfer to Liverpool. The Rossoneri confirmed on Twitter that Torres had landed at Milan's Linate Airport, where he was greeted by 200 fans, and posted a picture of the player holding an AC Milan scarf before announcing he was at the Madonnina Clinic undergoing his physical tests. AC Milan coach Filippo Inzaghi is hoping to guide Torres back to form. He said: 'It's not up to me to describe his worth on the pitch, it's up to me to help him return to being the player we all knew.' Torres, meanwhile added: 'I want to maybe stay here many years.'

The £50million Stamford Bridge flop had two years left on his £150,000-a-week deal at Stamford Bridge and it is believed that his representatives negotiated a significant severance package before Torres agreed to a move. After a difficult start at the Bridge following his move from Liverpool, Torres' form never really picked up for Chelsea. He managed just 45 goals in 172 appearances - equating to a staggering £1.1million per strike. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was keen to offload Torres before the transfer window closes on Monday in order to bring in an alternative forward - with Loic Remy now close to completing a move from West London rivals Queens Park Rangers. Milan were believed to have been interested in bringing Queens Park Rangers's Adel Taarabt back to the San Siro but that move is now off following Torres' arrival.

"Social networking site Twitter has said it will consider the removal of images of dead people at the request of family members. In a crackdown on gory and upsetting photographs that have emerged on the site recently, Twitter said it would consider taking down images of deceased individuals 'from when critical injury occurs to the moments before or after death'. But the site said it would take into account the public interest of any content and warned that it may not agree to all requests. Scroll down for video . Beheaded: James Wright Foley in a grab taken from YouTube and posted online by jihadist militant group ISIS . Twitter said it would consider taking down images of deceased individuals 'from when critical injury occurs to the moments before or after death' by request of family members . The announcement follows the shocking beheading of American photojournalist James Foley, 40, by an ISIS militant yesterday. Graphic footage of the gruesome execution appeared in a video called 'A Message to the US', was posted on social media by the terrorist group. In the video, the journalist, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, is forced to give a message to his family and links his imminent death to the US government's bombing campaign of ISIS targets in Iraq. He is beheaded with a small knife over a period of seven minutes by a masked man dressed in black, speaking with a London accent. Yesterday, the White House contacted social networks asking them to remove videos of his death. Twitter declined to say whether it had also received a request from Mr Foley's family. The policy change also comes a week after Robin Williams' daughter Zelda abandoned her Twitter account over distressing digitally altered images of her father. Twitter trolls posted a fake photograph claiming it was her dead father. She wrote: 'I'm shaking. I can't. Please. Twitter requires a link and I won't open it. Don't either. Please.' Robin Williams hanged himself on August, 11, while his wife slept in a nearby bedroom. Robin Williams' daughter Zelda abandoned her Twitter account over digitally altered images of her father . At the time, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety Del Harvey said: 'We will not tolerate abuse of this nature on Twitter. 'We have suspended a number of accounts related to this issue for violating our rules and we are in the process of evaluating how we can further improve our policies to better handle tragic situations like this one. 'This includes expanding our policies regarding self-harm and private information, and improving support for family members of deceased users.' But Google's former public policy chief Andrew McLaughlin warned the photos could have an important news value. He told the Washington Post: 'You can imagine that if you're a family member of this person, by all means you would want the horrific photos of their moment of death taken offline. 'But the photos are obviously newsworthy. 'It's awful that these photos were taken, and it's awful that this moment happened, but their very existence is news. 'It's the sort of thing that moves history.'","Twitter said it will consider taking down gory pictures of the deceased 'from when critical injury occurs to the moments before or after death'

"The latest version of Samsung’s Galaxy smartphone could have a three-sided display, rumours suggest. The new smartphone, which is tipped to launch next year, might sport a wrap-around display so that content on the curved screen can be read from extreme angles. The display is likely to feature on Samsung’s Galaxy S or Note luxury handsets, but it could even be the first of a new line of curvier handsets, according to the rumours. Samsung showed off its curved screens (pictured) at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. Here you can see how the curved edge of the display is being used for buttons and a rolling message to maximise space . A wraparound screen gets rid of dead space at the side of a handset, allowing for a larger display without a wider phone. The innovation allows for more innovative smartphone designs to give consumers something different. Curvier handsets could be more comfortable to hold and the screens easier to read. Some concepts have shown home and command buttons positioned on the side of handset screens - as well as caller ID and rolling news. By making use of the side of handsets for pop-up alerts, it enables a user to be able to multitask more effectively. Sources close to the company told Bloomberg the phone will use an enhanced version of the company’s Youm technology. Youm is used in Samsung’s Galaxy Round handset, which was released last month. However there is currently no release date for the next generation device, although it is likely to be launched in the second half of 2014, the sources said. The sources believe each side of the display could operate independently, which could make for a radical new experience for a smartphone user. Samsung sells around one in three luxury handset and is locked in competition with Apple to showcase the latest technologies in its smartphones. The new curved display is likely to feature on Samsung's S or Note luxury handsets, or could be the first of a new line of smartphones, according to rumours. It is predicted the device will use an updated version of the company's Youm technology, which is used for the Galaxy Round handset (pictured) launched last month . There are a number of companies working on curved screens. The Semiconductor Energy Laboratory has made a lightweight C-Axis Aligned Crystal (CAAC) material for this prototype smartphone, which has icons down its sides and allows images to 'spill' round its corners. It also allows for rolling text down its sides . Samsung will hope to repeat the success of its Galaxy S4 handset released in April (pictured) which is responsible for more than 60 percent of its third quarter profit . Apple is believed to be developing iPhones with larger screens, enhanced sensors for greater touchscreen accuracy and curved displays, putting pressure on Samsung to also be innovative with the designs of its next handsets. Van Baker, director of research at Gartner, said: ‘We’ll see curved displays coming into the market, but it’s just a question of whether they will gain any significant traction with customers.’ Samsung has already shown off curved screens at the Consumer Electronics Show in January and has used a flexible display for its Galaxy Gear smartwatch, as well as in a design for spectacles similar to Google Glass, that will be able to answer calls. Samsung filed a U.S. trademark application for Youm last year and has said the technology could be used in next generation computers and televisions, as well as Christmas lights. Lee Do Hoon, an analyst at CIMB Group Holding Bhd, in South Korea, said Samsung has a competitive advantage over Apple in the race to launch smartphones with flexible screens. Apple is expected to launch two handsets with larger, curved screens by the end of next year, according to rumours. The person ‘familiar with the plans’ said Apple is developing a 4.7-inch as well as a 5.5-inch model to rival Samsung and LG’s latest bendy handsets. The two phones are expected to curve along the side edges, Bloomberg reported. Reports said Apple’s curved glass could also come with sensors capable of identifying how heavy, or light a user’s touch is, meaning it could distinguish different pressure points. Both of Apple's new handsets are said to be ‘still in development,’ so they may not be released until at least September 2014. This would coincide with Apple’s annual product launch.","Rumours that display is likely to feature on .

"President Barack Obama coolly taunted congressional Republicans on Wednesday for dithering on his demand for billions to handle a flood of illegal immigration children streaming across the U.S.-Mexico border. At the same time he flatly denied that his own policy decisions have led to the rapidly expanding human tragedy. Calling the deluge a 'humanitarian situation on the border,' not an emergency or crisis, he parried claims that a 2012 executive order delaying the deportation of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants – those who had arrived in the U.S. as children before the summer of 2007 – incentivized children in Central America to make dangerous journeys to and across the Rio Grande river. 'I think the challenge we have that has really caused a spike,' Obama said in Dallas, 'is the significant security challenges in the Central American countries themselves, and smugglers who increasingly recognize that they can make money transporting individuals ....across the border.' Those conditions haven't significantly evolved since he took office in 2009, many Republicans point out. But a series of reports from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador indicate that his policy, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), was widely misinterpreted to mean that today's under-18 set could enter the U.S. and stay indefinitely. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama laid the burden of solving America's border crisis at Republicans' feet, blaming them for slow-walking a funding request and claiming that Central American nations were to blame for the flood of children across the southwest U.S. border . Obama made a push for his 'comprehensive' immigration reform proposal, claiming it would have freed up resources that could have prevented the deluge of boys and girls entering the U.S. illegally without accompanying adults . Obama, however, insisted that the overall 'pattern of immigration into our country' shows 'a significantly lower level [of illegal crossings' than we were when I took office.' The president did not directly address the rapidly growing numbers of children who now make up the largest proportion of the total by far since the U.S. government began counting it. Obama claimed Wednesday that his DACA policy, along with a far more ambitious 'comprehensive immigration reform' bill that has languished in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, should be seen as freeing up resources to tackle short-term challenges like the one currently plaguing Texas and Arizona. 'DACA and comprehensive immigration reform generally, would allow us to reallocate resources,' he said, because immigration officers would no longer be 'chasing after families who may have been here for five or 10 years and are law abiding except for the fact they they came here illegally.' When 'they are no longer an enforcement priority, that suddenly frees up a lot of resources,' he said. His 'comprehensive' approach 'would have put us in a stronger position to deal with this surge and, in fact, prevent it,' Obama declared. Capitol Hill Republicans have demanded that he use more of their existing appropriations to secure America's southwest border. A few have threatened to deny him newest funding request unless he complies. Texas Gov. Rick Perry met with Obama on Wednesday in Dallas and promptly issued a press release challenging him to do just that. 'Five hundred miles south of here in the Rio Grande Valley there is a humanitarian crisis unfolding  that has been created by bad public policy, in particular the failure to secure the border.' Confronted by a reporter who mentioned the statement, Obama was quick to assure the press corps that 'I'm interested in securing the border.' Perry's role as a prop in Wednesday's presidential theater began with a handshake after Air Force One landed for a presidential fundraising stop. Chris Christie 2.0? Perry (L) will likely catch grief from conservative Republicans over his welcome of Obama to the state where the GOP says the president's policies have caused the illegal immigration flood . Let's raise some money! (and talk about the border): Obama is in Texas for a pair of Democratic Party fundraisers, and only recently added meetings about the border crisis to his itinerary . Obama walked straight to the governor on the tarmac at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, hand outstretched, shook his hand and patted him on the back. A . similar political rapprochement earned New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie . scorn from inside his own party after he physically embraced Obama for . rushing federal relief funds to his state after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The two . met with Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, . Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, Dallas County judge Clay Jenkins and 'local . faith leaders' for a discussion. Reporters were not permitted at the roundtable meeting. Perry, Obama said, had asked him to act unilaterally to put more federal government resources – including a National Guard detachment – on the Texas-Mexico border. But the president saw the suggestion as an opening to upbraid House Speaker John Boehner, who plans to sue him for taking executive action that Republicans believe short-circuits their constitutional authority. On Air Force One between Denver and Dallas, White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest pointed to Perry's presence as a sign that Obama is willing to . compromise with the GOP about how to handle the flood of illegal . immigrant children streaming into the U.S. from Mexico. 'After all, Gov. Perry is a Republican,' Earnest said. Obama, however, slammed the GOP for refusing to write him a blank check in Washington. 'It would be useful for my Republican colleagues to rediscover the concept of negotiation and compromise,' he said. Roundtable: Obama (R) and Perry (2nd L) met with local government and religious leader in Dallas on Wednesday, more than 500 miles from the border crisis itself, which he would leave the state without visiting . On Tuesday and Wednesday a steady stream of federal legislators, including some Texas Democrats, criticized the president for failing to see the border crisis firsthand. But he said Wednesday that Jeh Johnson, his newly minter Homeland Security director, 'has now visited at my direction the border five times. ... He then comes back and reports to me extensively on everything that's taking place.' 'So there's nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and briefed on.' 'I'm not interested in photo-ops,' he said. That wasn't good enough for Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who said afterward that 'Texans do not need a lecture from a man who refuses to even see the crisis firsthand.' 'President Obama can fundraise and issue statements, Texans will work to solve the problem.'","The president spoke in Dallas following a meeting with officials and church leaders about the children flooding into the U.S. from Central America .

"Justin Bieber has backed a new smartphone app solely designed for people to share selfies. The app, which is called Shots of Me, is available in Apple’s App Store and encourages people to take and share pictures of themselves with a smartphone’s front-facing camera. It has an Instagram-inspired social network, which also links to Twitter to create a kind of network just for self-portraits. Look at me: Justin Bieber (pictured) is no stranger to selfies but now he has financially backed a new smartphone app solely designed for people to share their self-taken portraits . The app, created by RockLive is part funded by Justin Bieber, who was reportedly attracted to the product because it does not allow people to leave any comments. John Shahidi, CEO of RockLive, told TechCrunch that people enjoy looking at other people instead of browsing pictures of lunches and sunsets, which are common on other photo sharing platforms, such as Instagram. The Shots of Me app features a feed of selfies from friends and Twitter contacts as well as their names, locations, captions and the amount of ‘likes’ a photo receives. The app, which is called Shots of Me, is available in Apple's App Store and encourages people to take and share pictures of themselves taken with a smartphone's front-facing camera . The anti-trolling aspect is said to have attracted Justin Bieber to Shots of Me, who told Mr Shahidi that he is annoyed by other platforms allowing homophobic slurs and hate messages to be posted. Users of the app can only take photos of themselves using the front-facing camera of a phone and even then, can only take them via the Shots of Me app. This means that no uploading of images is allowed in a bid to ‘capture the moment’. Instead of leaving comments about selfies for all users to see, Shots of Me has a direct messaging system that invites messages from followers, in a bid to stop users criticising people in public - known as trolling. Users of the app can only take photos of themselves using the front-facing camera of a phone within the Shots of Me app. Instead of leaving comments, the app has a direct messaging system in a bid to stop to stop trolling . Survey claims Britons take 35million ‘selfies’ every month. More than 50 per cent admit snapping themselves with their mobile phones and cameras. A quarter of those even admit to taking a sexy selfie, but 36 per cent later regret it. Facebook is the most popular place to upload the photographs. Three-quarters of young people aged between 18 and 24 admit taking selfies, the study by mobile phone company HTC found. But the trend isn’t limited to the young. Twenty nine per cent, of those aged over 65 also take selfies. The new craze, which involves posing by yourself before taking a picture, has risen in popularity, with over one million selfies taken every day. The anti-trolling aspect is said to have attracted Justin Bieber to Shots of Me, who told Mr Shahidi that hs is annoyed by other platforms allowing homophobic slurs and hate messages to be posted. Mr Shahidi told TechCrunch: ‘The commenting thing was something he really cared about. Not just for himself, but for the kids. 'He said: ""I want a platform where my fans don’t have to deal with this."" We didn’t ask him for money. He said “I want to be part of this.”’ The company had raised just over one-and-a-half million dollars, but Justin Bieber contributed the majority of the $1.1million second round of investment. However, while this might be the popstar’s first publicly announced personal investment, he is believed to have backed a number of startups. While some people might think Shots of Me is a vehicle for vanity, there is no doubt that people are sharing more selfies than ever on social networks and it will be interesting to see if this dedicated app can capitalise on the trend. It faces stiff competition from established photo sharing platforms like Instagram, which has 150 active users as well as Snapchat, which allows users to post photos which are deleted within 10 seconds.","Shots of Me is available in Apple’s App .

"Former first lady of South Carolina Jenny Sanford wants a family court judge to order Rep. Mark Sanford, her cheating ex-husband, to stay sober while taking care of their youngest son. Jenny Sanford filed a court motion last week requesting that a judge ban she and her husband from making disparaging comments about . each other in front their teenage son and from 'consuming or being under the influence of illegal or unprescribed prescription drugs or excessive amounts of alcohol' while caring for him. Sanford also asked the court to require her ex to undergo psychiatric and . psychological evaluations and take anger management and parenting . courses.

Mark Sanford and his mistress-turned-fiancee Maria Belen Chapur wait for Speaker of the House John Boehner at a ceremonial swearing-in at the U.S. Capitol in May of 2013 after Sanford won a special election to Congress . The court motion said both Sanfords . should be restrained from exposing their youngest son overnight to a . member of the opposite sex 'who could reasonably be construed as a . paramour.' Jenny Sanford . wants the court to appoint an impartial guardian to look after the . interests of the youngest of their four sons, Blake, as well. 'It is the . defendant's behavior that has led the plaintiff to needing to bring this . action in the best interests of the minor child,' the motion said. In the Aug. 28 court filing, Jenny . Sanford's attorneys noted 'there has been a substantial change of . circumstances such that a visitation schedule should be put in place . that limits defendant's visitation with the minor child.' The . motion notes the while both Sanfords are in . the public eye 'this factor should not outweigh the best interests of . the child at issue or outweigh all other considerations.' A separate filing asks the court record . concerning issues to Blake be sealed. It said the . circumstances requiring a change in visitation will then be outlined in . an amended complaint filed once that is done.

Mark Sanford, who was the South Carolina governor when the two were married, bizarrely disappeared for five days in 2009 only to return from Argentina to acknowledge an affair with a woman to whom he is now engaged. Jenny Sanford soon sued for divorce, which was granted in 2010. The couple has four sons together, ranging in age from 15 to 22. Mark Sanford proposed to his former mistress, Maria Belen Chapur, in August of 2012. Despite the ongoing fall out from his . extra-marital affair Mark Sanford was elected to the House of Representatives last year to a seat that he held for three terms in the 1990s before becoming governor of his home state. Asked about her latest court battle with her former husband, Jenny Sanford said in an email Tuesday: 'I have no comment on this private matter other than to say that the restraints and other relief requested are common or standard practices frequently requested to protect minor children in similar custody situations. 'The court has been asked to apply the standard restraints to both of us,' he said. The Associated Press also left phone messages with Mark Sanford seeking comment. In July a family court judge ordered the couple to work with a mediator to resolve a dispute over putting more money in the trust funds of their two youngest sons. The accounts set up for their older boys at the time of the divorce were larger because they were closer to college.

"The number of people killed by Ebola has reached almost 7,000 as it emerged the World Health Organisation has missed ambitious targets to contain the deadly disease. The death toll currently stands at 6,928, according to the U.N. health agency, with the total number of people infected with the killer virus having surpassed 16,000. The figures, released today, come almost two months after the World Health Organisation (WHO) launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in West Africa - by aiming to isolate 70 per cent of the victims in the three hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by December 1. Scroll down for video . The Ebola death toll currently stands at 6,928, according to the World Health Organisation, with the total number of people infected having surpassed 16,000 in West Africa. Pictured: Health workers in Liberia . The health agency had launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in West Africa - by aiming to isolate 70 per cent of the victims in the three hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by tomorrow . New data shows there have been a total of 16,169 cases in those three countries alone, and approximately three dozen cases elsewhere. Liberia has recorded the highest number of cases and deaths, but the rate of infection is currently slowing there. In contrast, the disease is now spreading fastest in Sierra Leone. Out of the three West African countries, only Guinea is on track to meet the December 1 goal, according to an update from WHO. In Liberia, only 23 per cent of cases are isolated and 26 per cent of the required burial teams are in place. In Sierra Leone, about 40 per cent of cases are isolated while 27 per cent of burial teams are prepared and ready. With the target date of tomorrow looming, it is almost certain WHO's goals will be missed - marking another failure in attempts to slow the biggest-ever outbreak of the deadly disease. The outbreak of Ebola was first reported in Guinea in March and spiralled out of control after being declared a public health emergency in August. Dr. Bruce Aylward, who is directing the World Health Organisation's response to Ebola, acknowledged in October that reaching the December 1 goal would be 'really pushing the system hard.' Out of the three West African countries worst-hit, only Guinea is on track to meet the WHO's December 1 goal . Failure to meet the targets marks further problems in attempts to slow the biggest-ever outbreak of the virus . The disease is now spreading fastest in Sierra Leone, where there has been a severe surge in cases recently . He said: 'If we don't do it in 60 days and we take 90 days: No. 1, a lot more people will die that shouldn't; and No. 2, we will need that much more capacity on the ground to be able to manage the caseload.' In recent weeks, there have been some successes in curbing the deadly disease, with cases in Liberia and Guinea appearing to be declining or stabilising. However, the areas around Sierra Leone's capital and a district in the country's north are seeing a severe surge in cases. The December 1 targets had been met in many places - but not all, which was the goal, said Anthony Banbury, who is heading the U.N.'s Ebola response. 'There are still going to be many people who catch the disease and many people who die from it,' he said. Even if the December 1 targets had been reached, WHO and others had predicted Ebola would continue infecting people in West Africa and possibly elsewhere until sometime next year. Oyewale Tomori, of Redeemer's University in Nigeria, who sits on WHO's Emergency Ebola committee, said failing to reach the  target now suggests Ebola will spread even further as capacities to respond become even more stretched. 'We need to redouble our efforts to see what we can do to reduce the spread and catch up with the virus,' he said. 'Right now, it doesn't look good.' Earlier this month, the U.S. announced it was scaling back the size and number of Ebola clinics it had initially promised to build in Liberia, citing a drop in cases. The WHO now plans to isolate all patients by January 1 . December 6, 2013 - Ebola claims the life of its first victim in Guinea, thought to be a two-year-old from a remote village. The toddler, scientists believe was patient zero, suffered a fever, black stools and vomiting. March 25, 2014 - The Guinean authorities report the outbreak to the World Health Organisation after diagnosing the virus as Ebola. By this stage deaths from the virus was still confined to Guinea. May 2014 - It appeared as though the outbreak may be slowing, as the death toll tailed off. May 2014 - A very well-known woman from Guinea, a traditional medical practitioner and leader of a secret society died from the virus, Professor Piot said. Hundreds of people attended her funeral, travelling from three countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Dozens were infected and the disease spread across Guinea's southern border to both neighbouring nations. July 2014 - The virus crossed into Nigeria as Liberian man Patrick Sawyer died en route back to the US. He had been at the funeral of his sister, who died of Ebola. August 8, 2014 - The WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Other experts said the WHO goals were never very significant. Sebastian Funk, director of the centre for the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'You want to isolate 100 per cent of patients with Ebola and have 100 per cent safe burials. 'Getting to 70 per cent doesn't really mean a lot.' Dr. David Heymann, an Ebola expert who previously worked for the WHO, said: 'We hope that what we're seeing in Liberia will continue, but unfortunately what can happen with Ebola is that it can go to new countries, as it has already to Mali. 'The most dangerous thing would be if people now think Ebola is over and become complacent.' Earlier this month, the U.S. announced it was scaling back the size and number of Ebola clinics it had initially promised to build in Liberia, citing a drop in cases. Mr Banbury said the critical gap in those locations were new beds and that ending Ebola would be a long, hard fight. 'We're by no means out of the woods yet, but we're headed in the right direction,' he said. The ultimate goal of WHO's plan now is to isolate all Ebola patients and provide safe burials by January 1.","Number of people killed by Ebola now stands at 6,928, health agency said .

Just hours after the two-minute clip of the dance was uploaded to YouTube, the video attracted more than 2,000 hits. Mr McGonical, a retired bricklayer, said: 'We are amazed at the response from people. It wasn’t a planned thing, Joan and I were walking through town to Boots when we stopped to listen to a busker. 'He was playing a medley of lovely ballroom tunes and I could sense Joan moving her feet. I was tapping along and just said to her ""may I take this dance?"" and that was that. 'I suppose we got carried away but people were cheering and clapping and we just went along with it. It was a lovely sunny day and the shoppers seemed to like it.

The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, have been together for 40 years but have never married. Thomas added: 'We have both started dancing when we were about 14. We love it. 'We actually met ballroom dancing about 40 years ago at the Dorchester Dance Hall on Temple Street. 'We got to know each other and have been dancing ever since. We used to do it a lot more but there aren’t so many places to do it any more, that’s why we took our opportunity in the city centre. 'I hope to see even more people catch the dancing bug - and perhaps start quick-dancing down their streets too.' Joan, who has two children from a previous marriage, added: 'We watch Strictly Come Dancing together every week when it is on, and we are very nimble for our age. 'We do the cha cha, waltz, fox trot, samba, the quick step, we do them all. 'We used to go to the Civic Centre to dance but they prefer the bigger shows like gigs and famous performers so there are not as many dance nights as there used to be, which is a real shame. 'It is something we miss.' Shopper Daniella Brook, 25, who filmed the dancing duo, said: 'I was just out shopping with a friend and saw them and it touched my heart that they are still in love with dancing, and each other, after all these years.

"Have you ever wished there was a quicker and easier way to slice up fruit and make a healthy salad or feed hungry youngsters? If you have, one YouTube user has uploaded a video that he says is a 'quick kitchen tip that will change the way that you cut grapes, cherry tomatoes and grape tomatoes forever'. The short video, which lasts for just over one and a half minutes, features 'Papa Natural' as he demonstrates his  innovative method of cutting up fruit quickly and efficiently. Papa Natural places a second plate down on top of the cherry tomatoes and sandwiches the fruit in between . The American says instead of cutting up fruit 'one by one' on a cutting board, which is time consuming and 'increases the risk of cutting your fingers,' viewers should try his novel method. Papa Natural begins by taking two identical plates and a knife. He turns the first plate upside down with the bottom facing upwards. Then he places about a dozen grapes or tomatoes on the bottom of the plate and he puts the second plate down on top, sandwiching the fruit. Papa Natural shows a portion of grapes and cherry tomatoes which he cuts in half during his demonstration . First the US man puts the tomatoes which he intends to slice on the back of his first plate . The man then points to the gap between the two plates and pushes down on the upper plate as he takes his knife and cuts through them. Papa Natural says there are a number of benefits to cutting a bunch of tomatoes or grapes in half. He adds: 'Now why would you want to cut a bunch of tomatoes or grapes in half? 'Well it's perfect for when you have babies and you don't want to feed them the whole thing and it's also great when you're making a salad.'

"Last August the National Football League — the world’s richest sports administrator — were forced to pay almost £500million to former American Football players suffering from early onset dementia caused by repeated head injuries. Accused of decades of wilfully denying the long-term neurological damage caused by concussion, the NFL were hit in the only place that hurts: their pocket. Few British sports fans took notice. Taking notice: It's been a long time coming but British sports are finally taking concussion seriously . September, 2013 - Breaking news . Mail on Sunday runs the first piece on concussion entitled ‘Rugby’s ticking timebomb’ after evidence in United States links multiple head injuries to early onset dementia. The International Rugby Board and Rugby Football Union both deny there is enough evidence to make such a claim. Former Wasps scrum half Nic Berry, forced to retire after multiple concussions, reveals his desperate fight to save his career and his wife’s fears for his future. Sept 22, 2013 - Moody joins the fight . Former England captain Lewis Moody offers to donate his brain to medical research as the Mail on Sunday launches its concussion campaign. November, 2013 - Football in dock . Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas is branded ‘irresponsible’ and ‘reckless’ for allowing goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to play on after being knocked unconscious. The IRB admits ‘potential link’ between head injuries and early onset dementia. CEO Brett Gosper tells us there will be no cover up on concussion study research. A week later, a coroner in Belfast found that Ben Robinson, a 14-year-old schoolboy rugby player with the world at his feet, died from Second Impact Syndrome after being allowed to carry on playing in a school’s cup game despite suffering obvious effects of concussion. A few British sports fans took notice. Six weeks later goalkeeper Hugo Lloris remained on the field at White Hart Lane after manager Andre Villas-Boas deemed the fact he had lost consciousness for almost a minute after his head collided with Romalu Lukaku’s knee was no reason to replace him. Lloris did not play again for a month and Villas-Boas was derided. People were taking notice. This week, RFU head of discipline Gerard McEvilly indicated to the Mail on Sunday that they will clamp down on any similar such meddling by coaches in this season’s Aviva Premiership. There is an appetite within rugby to introduce point deductions, or even fines for those breaching newly updated head injury protocols designed to protect players from themselves, or worse the meddling hand of coaches tempted to risk player’s long-term health for the sake of a league point. The sporting landscape has changed. ‘In just 12 months sports concussion has moved from an almost exclusively American sports issue to one that is now a major issue for global sport,’ said Professor Willie Stewart — a brain injury expert who advises the International Rugby Board. Unacceptable: Cristoph Kramer was allowed to play on after a concussion in the World Cup final . Feb 28, 2014 - Campaign saluted . The Mail on Sunday concussion campaign becomes the first sports campaign to be shortlisted for the prestigious Cudlipp Prize at the UK Press Awards. Parliamentary cross-party group looking into head injuries in sport chaired by MP Chris Bryant praises Mail on Sunday’s contribution. Mar 9, 3014 - Poor tests . England and British Lions prop Alex Corbisiero speaks out in the Mail on Sunday, describing current concussion protocols as ‘a joke’. Mar 13, 2014 campaign success . The RFU and Premier Rugby announce sweeping new concussion measures, including agreeing to carry out independent research, compulsory concussion education for players, coaches and referees and the distribution of educational material to clubs and schools. Mail on Sunday discovers 10-year study promised in the wake of former England striker Jeff Astle’s death from early on-set dementia in 2002 was never undertaken. Stewart, along with men such as Chris Nowinski at Boston University, where hundreds of brains have been examined and evidence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in former footballers, rugby players and professional wrestlers has been found, are taking the conversation out of the hands of the mega-bucks sporting unions intent on sugar-coating reality in order to protect commercial interests. Doctors employed by sports governing bodies with a vested interest in playing down the risk of concussion, are finally being challenged to back up with hard, reasoned evidence their claims that head injuries somehow resolve themselves. So far that evidence has not been forthcoming. Professor Paul McCrory, the lead author of the Zurich Consensus on Concussion in Sport, steadfastly refuses to speak with the media. ‘The most noticeable change since the start of the Mail on Sunday Concussion Campaign, has been the fact “The Elephant in the Room,” has escaped,’ said Ben Robinson’s father Peter, who has campaigned tirelessly since his son died needlessly in 2011. ‘Concussion is now in the public domain and no longer controlled by sporting bodies. Phrases such as “Concussion can be fatal” and “If in doubt sit them out” can be mentioned without feeling we have to produce a death certificate to justify it.’ Impact: The incident with Hugo Lloris opened up many people's eyes to the issue of concussion in sport .

Jeff Astle’s family meet FA chairman Greg Dyke, who apologises for their failure to deliver research and commits to fund future head injury study. Sept 3, 2014 . RFU say they are considering introducing a formal sanctioning process to prevent clubs flouting concussion protocols. But while progress has been made, there is still much more to be done. Players still cheat concussion tests, research has still not been carried out, coaches still pressure doctors across professional sport. The relentless commercial imperative to deliver ‘success’ on the pitch routinely overrides concerns about players’ long-term health. Last November the IRB’s chief executive Brett Gosper promised research into the effects of head injuries would be published. ‘There will be no cover up, we are not a cigarette company,’ said Gosper. Almost 10 months later, the research has still not been published. Following Jeff Astle’s death in 2002, the FA promised his family they would conduct a 10-year study. Almost 12 years after that promise was made, no research has been published. PFA chairman Gordon Taylor — reportedly earning more than £1m for a position at the top of the players union — has made no contact with the Astle family since a coroner found that Jeff died from ‘industrial disease’ caused by heading footballs. ‘Since the Mail on Sunday launched its concussion in sports campaign some sports have taken a few steps in the right direction,’ said Labour MP Chris Bryant, who wrote the report ‘Concussion can Kill’. ‘FIFA have said they will do some research. The FA have changed the rules for the professional game so that a medic — not the player, not the coach and definitely not the manager — should now make the decision on whether a player goes back on after a blow to the head. 'Rugby has started making sensible noises too. But these are still faltering steps. We still don’t have a consistent message about concussion that applies across all sports.’ That message is that ‘concussion can kill’. The NFL denied that fact for decades and has ended up paying millions while a cohort of players have died suffering early onset dementia caused by head injuries which could have been avoided. A year later, professional sport in Britain is taking notice. If it does not there will be more Ben Robinsons while the prediction of the FA’s head of medicine Ian Beasley of a ‘tsunami’ of compensation claims will come true. Sport has started to take notice. But is it too late?","After over a year of campaigning, British sport is beginning to accept the dangers of concussion .

Workers in Wales have the shortest commute, at an average of just 41.4 minutes. Welsh workers had the shortest commuting time, and men in Wales have seen their commute time drop by 4.6 minutes since 2006. The TUC study, an analysis of official figures from the government's Labour Force survey, was published today to mark the start of Work Wise UK's Commute Smart week. Commuting is also set to get more expensive next year, as rail passengers will face fare hikes of up to 11 per cent, adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of annual season tickets. Season ticket fares to London will cost some commuters in excess of £6,000. From January 1, train firms can increase their ‘regulated’ fares, including rush-hour commuter tickets and off-peak fares, by three percentage points more than the retail price index inflation figure of 3.2 per cent for last July. The train companies also have the flexibility to add another 5 per cent to respond to changes in demand for particular services – meaning some fares could rise by as much as 11.2 per cent. Rail fares have risen by more than inflation every year for the past decade.5.8 for women . In London, fares for the bus and Tube are set to rise by an average of 4.2% from January 2, and even cycling commuters who make use of Boris Bikes could feel the pinch.

"Guilty: Tyler Holder, 18, pleaded guilty to charges of murdering his 6-year-old neighbor last year. He was sentenced to life in prison . An 18-year-old man will spend the rest of his life in prison, after admitting to the murder of his 6-year-old neighbor whose body was found dumped on a street corner last summer. Tyler Holder plead guilty on Thursday to charges of murder in the death of his young neighbor Alanna Gallagher, who went missing last June. Her body was found soon after less then a mile away from her Saginaw, Texas home and an autopsy report revealed the little girl had been raped. Holder, who was 17 at the time, was arrested when his DNA was found on her body. In exchange for pleading guilty, Holder got a life in prison sentence. He will also serve 40 years for shooting at a police officer during his arrest, and 20 years for setting a car on fire a week after Alanna's killing. Alanna mother Laura gave a statement at the sentencing, saying Holder won't be able to hurt any more children but 'it does not repay for what you have done'. 'It does not bring her back to us. No matter how much suffering you undergo in prison, it won’t be as much as all the people who knew and loved Alanna have been, and will continue to be suffering,' Laura Gallagher said. 'I hope you remember this, and that you live with shame for what you have done, every day that you live, every day that Alanna is gone from us.' Alanna was the daughter of Laura Gallagher and her husband Karl. The couple also lived with a man named Miles McDaniel as part of a polyamorous relationship. 'There are no more relaxed Saturday morning snuggles with her, filled with talk and giggles,' Mrs Gallagher continued in the statement. 'I will never again get to go wake her first on a school morning, because she always woke the most cheerfully — I’d tickle her toes and say ""Good morning, toes!"" and she’d laugh and say ""Good morning, Mama!!"" and come help wake her siblings. Tragic: 6-year-old Alanna Gallagher's body was found less than a mile from her home, where she went missing last summer . 'Our house is emptier, and quieter, and sadder. We carry around a heavy hard stone of pain where our hearts used to be. And it’s your fault.' Little Alanna's body was found the evening of July 1, 2013, inside a silver tarp that was dropped on a street corner less than a mile from her house. Investigators found her body inside, wrapped in a black trash bag with her head covered in plastic sacks and secured with tape wrapped around her neck. Family: Alanna was the daughter of Laura and Karl Gallagher (left). The couple also lived with a man named Miles McDaniel (right), as part of a poly-amorous relationship . Police questioned Holder the day after, since he lived with his mother just two houses away from the Gallagher family. He said he hadn't seen her, and agreed to submit to a DNA test a few days later. When that DNA sample matched that found on Alanna's body, police took out an arrest warrant and showed up at Holder's house. Holder responded violently and initiated a shootout with authorities, seriously injured Officer Charles Lodotto with a bullet. The teen suspect was also shot in the neck during the fight,and he posed for his mugshot with a bandage on his throat. 'Today a dangerous killer was brought to justice,' Deputy Chief District Attorney Bob Gill said in a news release on Thursday. 'Tyler Holder will never pose a danger to another child. The family of Alanna Gallagher and Officer Charles Lodatto are very satisfied with this resolution of the cases.' Holder will also serve a 40 year sentence for shooting a police officer who was trying to arrest him.

The new feature has been confirmed today on Twitter's support page after users first reported the appearance of content from other accounts last week, with many believing it to be just an experiment . On Twitter's 'Discover' page, users can see recommendations for accounts they may find interesting in the 'Who to follow' box. These are based on the types of accounts the user is already following and who those accounts follow. Now posts from these users will also appear on their main timeline. As well as this, the social network will find content that is popular or relevant based on the user's previous tweets. These posts will be published on their timeline, regardless of whether the Tweeter is being followed. Twitter will also republish posts based on how people in a network are interacting with it. The new feature will mean that 'favourited tweets' - traditionally a way of saving a tweet without making them public - will start to appear in users' timelines. But this has now changed, as the site's support page explained. 'Additionally, when we identify a Tweet, an account to follow, or other content that's popular or relevant, we may add it to your timeline,' a statement on the official site said. 'This means you will sometimes see Tweets from accounts you don't follow. 'We select each tweet using a variety of signals, including how popular it is and how people in your network are interacting with it. 'Our goal is to make your home timeline even more relevant and interesting.'

But it has always been possible to view favourites by using the Discover section of the Twitter app or website.

The change is seen by some as an attempt to increase user interest as the site looks to close the gap on Facebook in user numbers. As of March this year, Twitter had 241 million active users globally, with more than 15 million in the UK. In comparison, rival social network Facebook has more than one billion users active each month. The move has proved unpopular with users so far, with many taking to the site to voice their frustration at the new, unwanted content appearing within their timeline. One user from Manchester tweeted to complain he was seeing content related to his deceased stepfather now appearing on his profile. The move has proved unpopular with users so far, with many taking to the site to voice their frustration at the new, unwanted content appearing within their timeline . For the moment, the change does not affect third-party Twitter apps like Tweetbot, which are operated by independent software and present user timelines in alternative ways, as well as offering different features. But it is likely the apps will absorb this new feature eventually thanks to their connection with Twitter's main servers. 'Twitter purists will accuse today's update of the platform moving one step closer to being Facebook, as it shifts from personally-curated content to recommended content,' said Jack Parsons, a technology expert from Android Magazine. 'However, this change makes sense for Twitter as a company as it will make the social network more accessible to enterprises looking to promote their products, just as the introduction of images appearing in timelines did several months ago. 'It will be interesting to see how everyday tweeters adapt to this new feature and whether or not they think will more carefully about how they favourite a tweet.' Swathes of Twitter users have expressed annoyance at the roll-out of an experimental new feature. Users of the social network have reported seeing tweets favourited by other people in their own timeline. In addition to this, some members have complained that their feed shows tweets alerting them that an account they follow has followed a new account. Currently, only retweets posted by accounts that someone has personally chosen to follow show up on timelines, as well as advertisements, according to the Next Web. Members have voiced their anger over the ‘experiment’, with many explaining that they were never given the option to opt out of sharing content they had marked as a 'favourite' with their followers.

"Ever thought that giving up your favourite sweet treat was almost impossible? Scientists at the University of New South Wales have found that feeding rats a junk food diet made it harder for the rats to return to a healthy diet. This study could explain why it's harder for overweight people to avoid high calorie foods. Junk food could actually be changing your brain's ability to eat healthy food . The study published in Frontiers in Psychology led by Professor Margaret Morrie helps explain how excessive consumption of junk food can change behavior, weaken self-control and lead to overeating and obesity.The team of researchers taught young male rats to associate two different sound cues with a two particular flavours of sugar water. Healthy rats, raised on a healthy diet, stopped responding to cues linked to a flavour they had recently overindulged in. This instinctive mechanism in animals protects against overeating and promotes a healthy, balanced diet. The key to why junk food is so addictive may have been found . After two weeks on a diet that included pies, dumplings, cookies and cake – with 150 per cent more calories – the rats’ weight increased by 10 per cent and their behaviour changed dramatically. They became indifferent in their food choices and no longer avoided the sound advertising the over familiar taste, indicating they had lost their natural preference for novelty. The change lasted for some time after the rats returned to a healthy diet. 'We think that a junk diet causes lasting changes in the reward circuit parts of the rats’ brains in the area responsible for decision-making,' said Professor Morris. The researchers think that a junk diet causes lasting changes in the area of the brain responsible for decision-making . 'Because the brain’s reward circuitry is similar in all mammals, this could have implications for people’s ability to limit their intake of certain kinds of foods.' 'If the same thing happens in humans, eating junk food may change our responses to signals associated with food rewards. It’s like you’ve just had ice cream for lunch, yet you still go and eat more when you hear the ice cream van comes by,' she explained. Dr Amy Reichelt from the School of Psychology in UNSW Science says:'As the global obesity epidemic intensifies, advertisements may have a greater effect on people who are overweight and make purchases of snacks like chocolate bars harder to resist.' Ultimately the study shows that if the human brain works like the rats brain, junk food is almost an addiction that our bodies are not able to resist. Rats on the two week high calorie diet had a harder time readjusting to their healthy balanced diet and saw an increase in their weight .","Scientists at Sydney's University of New South Wales may have found the reason why overweight people struggle to give up fatty foods .
The UNSW study could prove that particular high calorie foods are addictive .
The study performed on rats shows that junk food not only makes rats fat, it also stops them from seeking out a balanced diet ."

"Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said Sunday that President Barack Obama beat him at pool not once but twice when the two ran into each other at a bar in Denver last week. Hickenlooper told reporters at the National Governors Association meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, yesterday that he 'felt pretty good' about his odds of winning the game when he challenged Obama, but the president turned out to be a much better player than he expected. 'He was making long shots with a difficult angle. I didn’t know people in Hawaii played that much pool. Evidently they do,' Hickenlooper said, according to the Wall Street Journal. 'The man is a shark.' After pictures of Obama playing pool and . drinking a beer with Hickenlooper were published, the president took . flack for taking time out of his schedule to have a boys night out in . Denver while adamantly refusing to make a pit stop at the border during . his swing through Texas in the two days that followed. Scroll down for video . Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper admitted to reporters at the National Governors Association convention yesterday that 'he felt pretty good' going into his pool game with President Barack Obama last week and was shocked that the president beat him not once but twice . Obama had already boasted about beating the Democratic Governor in pool at a fundraiser the following day in Denver but said nothing about playing - and winning - against the state's chief executive more than once. 'I walked over to Hickenlooper’s old joint. Hickenlooper was there. He . challenged me to pool,' Obama told donors, referring to Wynkoop Brewing Co., a bar Hickenlooper used to own. 'You can ask him how that went,' Obama continued. 'I took his lunch . money.' Reporters who caught the men's first game and Obama's big win said neither of the elected leaders played well the first half of the game. 'And then, literally before my eyes he ran like four balls,' Hickenlooper said yesterday, recounting the his defeat at the hands of the president. Obama smoked the Colorado Governor, sinking the eight ball when Hickenlooper still had five balls on the table. 'I take a little longer to warm up,' Hickenlooper said at the time. Hickenlooper was the one who challenged Obama to a game of pool last Tuesday night at Wynkoop Brewing Co. not knowing how good Obama was at the game. 'He was making long shots with a difficult angle. I didn¿t know people in Hawaii played that much pool,' he said on Sunday . After reporters were escorted out of the room, Hickenlooper says the men played a second game, double or nothing, for $20, and Obama won that game, too. 'I was playing as hard as I could possibly play,' the newly minted National Governor's Association chairman said on the last day of the organization's conference. 'I still had four balls on the table when he nailed the eight ball.' 'I’m not a bad pool player,' he opined. After the game, Obama began to walk away with the $20 pot, Hickenlooper said, but the president doubled back and returned the money. 'Find a good charity,' the president reportedly told him. Obama was in Colorado at the time to attend a luncheon benefiting the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and incumbent Senator Mark Udall, who is up for reelection this year. The president also gave a speech on the economy and met with a local supporter who had written him a letter before traveling to Texas for similar events. He did not, however, visit the U.S.-Mexico border to take stock of what he himself has called a 'humanitarian crisis' during his trip to the Lone Star state, upsetting Texas politicians, including a congressman from his own political party. 'He's so close to the border,' Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar said last week. 'And let me say this: when I saw, and I hate to use the word bizarre, but under the circumstances, when he is shown playing pool in Colorado, drinking a beer, and he can't even go 242 miles to the Texas border?' he continued. Cuellar said he 'very very upset' that Obama made time for a photo op with Hickenlooper but wouldn't go see the illegal immigrant children being held in detention facilities in southern Texas.","President Barack Obama traveled to Denver, Colorado, last week to attend a fundraiser and meet with a supporter .

"These are the stunning scenes of famous cities that make landmarks in London and far away destinations look like toy towns. New York photographer Richard Silver took photographs of commuters and day trippers mingling on streets before using digital photograph technology to give them a 'tilt-shift' effect. The effect makes cars, public transport and people look like figures in fantastic landscapes used for toys. Richard, 52, said, 'Position wise I need to be high up like on top of a building, mountain or hill. Taking the photograph takes seconds, post processing takes about 15 minutes [for] each photograph using Photoshop. 'There is an actual lens that is called tilt-shift, I choose not to use it and do all of my tilt shifting in post-production. 'After doing this for almost six years now I know exactly what and how to photograph. 'I travel around for work so for me to do this project – it is something that I almost feel the need to do. I try to Tilt-Shift every place I travel to.' The photographer has captured St Mark's Square in Venice, Westminster in London, Krakow in Poland and Rome's Colosseum and the Vatican, among others in a new light. Richard was inspired by Olivo Barbieri, an Italian photographer and says his Tilt-Shift work 'blew me away so much that I figured out how to shoot similar to his style'.

"A couple who were separated from their baby for more than a year have been awarded £12,000 compensation in a landmark ruling. The pair – who have learning difficulties and are in their 30s – will receive the payment after a judge at the High Court in London said their basic human rights had been violated by social workers. In the first known case of its kind, family judge Clifford Bellamy told how social workers employed by Leicester City Council had dragged their feet in sorting out the case, leading to trauma for the parents. In a landmark ruling at the High Court in London today, a judge ruled that a local council had breached a disabled couple's human rights after taking away their baby for more than a year . During the court hearing, it emerged that medical professionals had no idea the mother was pregnant before she gave birth in May last year. The court heard that it was unclear whether she concealed her pregnancy or was genuinely unaware of it. The couple had not been under assessment by social workers prior to the birth. When the girl, known only as Baby H, was born Leicester City Council social workers stepped in and decided that she was ‘at risk of significant harm’. The couple, who cannot be named, were prevented from taking her home from hospital. The judge said he felt great sympathy for the parents as they had ‘no one to speak up for them’. They had no choice in the matter as their baby was put into care with a couple known to them and were then stymied in their efforts to be reunited with their daughter. The judge said the confused parents were repeatedly ‘subjected to unnecessary delay and uncertainty’. The council took almost a year to launch proper care proceedings. Baby H had already celebrated her first birthday before her parents were sent on a 12-week residential course to assess their ability to look after her. Judge Bellamy said that was the first time they had ‘been together as a family’ since her birth. Leicester City Council, based at the city's town hall (pictured), claimed the couple were not entitled to compensation, but after fighting a High Court battle, they were ordered to pay £12,000 to the family . The child is now almost 18 months old and the couple are finally able to look after her under close supervision. ‘The happy ending must not be allowed to mask or diminish this local authority’s serious failings in the way that it dealt with this case and the impact that had on these parents,’ he said. Family judge Clifford Bellamy said the council had 'dragged its feet' in launching legal proceedings . The judge also expressed sympathy for a foster couple who had cared for the baby. He found they had taken her into ‘their home and their hearts’ and had been given hope they would look after her permanently. After initially being told they would be caring for the baby for a fortnight, social workers then said she might never be returned to her parents and they became ‘deeply attached to her’. Judge Bellamy ruled the council had admitted making 14 mistakes. These included failing to explain to the couple why their daughter was being cared for ‘far away from them against their expressly stated wishes’. The council admitted that its failures breached the parents’ human rights to a fair hearing and to respect for their privacy and family life. ‘The nature and extent of the poor practice admitted by the local authority is such that an adverse impact on these parents was inevitable,’ added the judge. ‘They would have needed great fortitude to be able to take such an experience in their stride. ‘Far from having great fortitude it is clear that these are vulnerable, learning disabled parents who had no one to speak up for them.’ Despite admitting it had violated the parents’ human rights, the council argued that it was ‘inappropriate’ to award them damages. However, the judge said that because the baby wasn’t returned to her parents until June this year; ‘These parents have suffered a loss of time with their daughter which was both unnecessarily lengthy and deeply distressing.’ He ordered that the council pay £6,000 damages to each parent, adding that this was the least required to ‘afford just satisfaction’ for what they had endured.","Leicester City Council did not know woman was pregnant before birth .

"College football champion Jameis Winston and Florida State University may be sued by a woman accusing the star player of sexual assault. The charges against the 20-year-old quarterback were dropped in December last year, however the woman’s attorney has said she intends to sue the school, the Tallahassee Police Department and the player himself.

"David Cameron was under mounting pressure last night to recall Parliament to debate Britain’s response to the terrifying advance of Islamist fanatics in Iraq. As the Prime Minister began his third holiday of the year, the former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, said ‘the nation would expect’ Parliament to be recalled. Lord Dannatt, a former defence adviser to Mr Cameron, said the potential implications of the conflict – which Mr Cameron warned this week could bring ‘mayhem to our streets’ – meant that Britain’s response should be fully debated. Scroll down for video . Lord Dannatt, right, pictured alongside Prince Philip, said that MPs and Lords would want to discuss the growing crisis in Iraq following David Cameron's decision to deploy UK special forces to the region . He added: ‘I think MPs and members of the House of Lords will get very frustrated if they stay in recess. ‘People need to have a full debate about it and express their point of view. I think the nation would expect that.’ Mr Cameron has already approved the use of special forces troops in northern Iraq, and British warplanes are conducting reconnaissance missions over large swathes of Iraq as part of an intervention that is expected to last for months. The Prime Minister has ruled out a large-scale deployment of British ‘boots on the ground’. But he is considering arming the Kurdish fighters who are trying to push back the Islamic State terrorists in Iraq. Tory MP Conor Burns said this move alone required parliamentary approval. He said: ‘We are tiptoeing towards having a policy. ‘We are seeing people be-headed, some people buried alive and even, extraordinarily, crucifixions carried out in Iraq, by ISIS, a group that want to wage a holocaust on those who don’t share their evil and craven outlook on the world. ‘I want Parliament to come back and I want us to hold the Government to account. Why are we not arming the Kurds? Why are we only providing humanitarian aid?’ Mr Cameron faced criticism yesterday as he and his wife Samantha began a week-long break in Cornwall, less than a week after returning from a vacation in Portugal. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has also departed on holiday, leaving new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to handle the crisis. David Cameron, right, pictured with his wife Samantha, said he would return to London if the crisis worsened . Mr Cameron has defended his break, saying he will return to London immediately if the crisis in Iraq worsens. The United Nations agency for refugees yesterday launched a major aid operation to reach half a million people displaced in northern Iraq. In the town of Dohuk, survivors told horrific stories of IS brutality and executions. Khalof Khodede, a father of three, told how 80 men in the Yazidi village of Kocho were killed and all the women and girls were kidnapped. He said he had only survived by hiding under the bodies of those executed, He said that IS fighters took the men to the first floor of a building and the women to the second after the villagers’ money and gold jewellery were seized. The Yazidis were then loaded onto minibuses in groups of 10 to 20 and transported outside the village after being told they would be taken to Sinjar, the ancient homeland of the sect. The vehicles stopped abruptly and the militants opened fire without warning. Yesterday Iraqi forces halted an offensive they had launched to recapture the city of Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, due to fierce resistance from Islamic State fighters.","Lord Dannatt believes Iraqi crisis requires the recall of Parliament .

"Ferrari announced the departure of their president Luca di Montezemolo, marking the end of a glorious but faded era. In two spells, Di Montezemolo won 19 world titles, the last of them the constructors’ championship in 2008. But the wait for fresh glory — and the politics of Ferrari — cost him the job he carried off with conspicuous urbanity for 23 years. The 67-year-old will officially leave with an eye-watering £23million pay-off on October 13 to be replaced by Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne, who seems to have forced Di Montezemolo’s exit primarily because they disagreed over the direction of the business. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luca Di Montezemolo step down as Ferrari chairman . Sergio Marchionne and Luca  di Montezemolo attend a Ferrari press conference to announce the news .

Luca di Montezemolo,  Mika Salo, Michael Schumacher  and Ferrari chief Jean Todt pose  in Vallelunga in 1999 . While the Ferrari road car is delivering record profits, the Formula One team again needs precisely the kind of major surgery that Di Montezemolo specialised in. For too long, Fernando Alonso’s consistent and fabulous driving has masked the essential limitations of their cars. This year’s engine is deficient in comparison with that of Mercedes. That was especially disappointing because the major change to hybrid power offered them a chance to turn the corner. Poor results have led to flux within the team. Stefano Domenicali left as principal in April. His record was mixed rather than terrible. He led Ferrari to the last of Di Montezemolo’s titles. But, as Di Montezemolo noted as long ago as 1992, Ferrari carries with it ‘the burden of false assumption, a public belief that we should win because we have so much money.’ On Domenicali’s departure, high-flying Ferrari executive Marco Mattiacci was parachuted in from car sales in America. The competent way he has gone about his work has belatedly answered some of the early doubts, but he is still a greenhorn. After Di Montezemolo’s departure was announced, Mattiacci and Marchionne met at the team’s Maranello factory. Afterwards, a spokesman dismissed the pair’s combined lack of pit-lane experience, saying: ‘There are many experienced people at Ferrari — the people here are our strength. ‘Mr Marchionne’s chairmanship has galvanised the clear, common objective to get back to the top.’ Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone paid tribute to one of his oldest friends and adversaries, saying: ‘His leaving is, for me, the same as Mr Enzo dying. He has become Ferrari. You see him, you see Ferrari. You don’t see anything else. You don’t see Luca.’ Luca di Montezemolo congratulates Michael Schumacher after winning for Ferrari at Imola in 2000 . Luca di Montezemolo talks with Rubens Barrichello during practice at the Hungaroring racetrack in 2000 . Luca di Montezemolo and Fiat CEO Giuseppe Morchio celebrate  at the Monza racetrack in 2003 . How? It is possible they will entice Ross Brawn, their legendary technical leader, out of a sabbatical-cum-retirement, but will he be willing to return to such a fierce glare while in his 60th year and with millions in the bank? Perhaps they don’t need him. Mattiacci, who talked before Di Montezemolo’s departure of needing to ‘turn the page culturally’, is a big supporter of James Allison, the 46-year-old technical director, an Englishman and putatively the new Brawn. Next year Ferrari are likely to retain this season’s driver line-up — a Latin in Fernando Alonso and a Finn in Kimi Raikkonen. Indeed, Alonso is unlikely to be upset by the news after Di Montezemolo upbraided him last year for making ‘rash statements’. Some of Di Montezemolo’s theatrics looked hackneyed by the end and his semi-detached management style possibly acted as a brake on progress. But he undoubtedly fought hard for Ferrari since, as a 20-something Piedmont aristocrat, he became a protégé of the ‘Old Man’ Enzo Ferrari. A law graduate, Di Montezemolo began as Enzo’s assistant in 1973, taking over as the Scuderia’s manager the following year. In that stint, he won three constructors’ titles and, through his signing of Niki Lauda, two drivers’ championships.

Fernando Alonso (left) looks on next to  Luca  di Montezemolo after the third practice session of the Italian GP . He took up various posts at the parent company Fiat before organising Italia 90. That World Cup ran like clockwork, and so hard did Di Montezemolo work that his weight plummeted from a slim 11st to a skeletal 8st. He was called back by Fiat boss Gianni Agnelli in 1991 to shake up Ferrari, which was then shorn of success on the track and deep in debt off it. He produced huge profits and laid the groundwork for unprecedented Formula One success by bringing in the perfectionist team boss Jean Todt, Brawn star designer Rory Byrne and, to cap it all, Michael Schumacher. More recently he formed FOTA, the teams’ association, which brought an end to Max Mosley’s reign as FIA president. After the meeting in Paris, he stood on Mosley’s office balcony at Place de la Concorde, two friends and enemies of 40 years, looking down at where the revolutionary guillotine once stood. The coup, it seems, happened because Di Montezemolo and Marchionne could not co-exist within Fiat, which is soon to be floated on the stock exchange. Last Sunday’s dismal result at the Italian Grand Prix — two points — was the final cut for Ferrari’s own Sun King.","Di Montezemolo won 19 titles in 23 years with the Prancing Horse .

"Denmark has finally vowed to ban sex with animals because the practice is 'damaging the country's reputation' as well as being non-consensual. The country has become a magnet for animal sex tourists in recent years and has even seen a surge in animal brothels - as bestiality is banned almost everywhere else in Europe. Danish agricultural minister Dan Jorgensen said he will outlaw the act - closing the legal loophole following mounting pressure from the international community. Ban: Danish agricultural minister Dan Jorgensen made the decision to outlaw sex with animals claiming the country's reputation was suffering as it had become a magnet for animal sex tourists . He told Danish daily Ekstra Bladet: 'I have decided that we should ban sex with animals. This is because it constitutes an attack on the animal, which naturally cannot consent to sex. 'It is also damaging to our country's reputation to allow this practice to continue here while it is banned elsewhere.' A recent Gallup opinion poll revealed that 76 per cent of Danes supported a ban on animal sex. The bill, which also requires changes in the country's welfare animal laws, will be introduced by the Danish government in 2015. Speaking in a VICE documentary, Danish animal rights activist Karoline Lundstrom recently commented: 'I don't think the Danish government is doing enough to protect the animals. 'They need to do something to protect zoophilia in Denmark.' Bestiality has been illegal in England since 1290 under the reign of Edward I, but many of our European neighbours including France, Germany, Belgium and Holland have only outlawed the practice in the last ten years. Non-consensual: The Danish politician pointed out that bestiality 'constitutes an attack' as animals are unable to offer consent . Sweden banned zoophilia, another term describing sex with animals, in April 2014 in a move backed by the country's Rural Affairs Minister, Eskil Erlandsson. 'There should be no doubt whatsoever that bestiality is unacceptable,' The Local cited him as saying. In 2012 the same ban was passed in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government introduced the new law against the practice, saying animals should not be used 'for personal sexual activities or made available to third parties for sexual activities… thereby forcing them to behave in ways that are inappropriate to their species.' Bestiality is still legal in Finland, Hungary and Romania.","Minister outlaws practice claiming country's reputation was suffering .

"Rafa Benitez's Napoli have it all to do in the second leg of this Champions League qualifier after  Athletic Bilbao nabbed an all-important away goal and earned a 1-1 draw in Italy. Bilbao, competing in the Champions League for the first time in more than 15 years, had Benitez on the brink of elimination but the former Liverpool and Chelsea manager was given  hope by a second-half equaliser from Argentina striker Gonzalo Higauin. That was  after Iker Muniain's composed finish in the first gave  Bilbao the lead against a shadow of a Napoli side the 60,000 fans at the Stadio San Paolo are used to seeing.

Napoli XI: Rafael, Britos, Koulibaly, Albiol, Jorginho, Hamsik (Michu 79), Insigne (Mertens 61), Maggio, Gargano, Higuain, Callejon . Napoli substitutes: Andujar,  Mesto, Ghoulam, Inler, Zapata .

Athletic Bilbao substitutes: Herrerin,  Iraola, Guillermo, Lopez . Bookings: Gurpegui (73), Balenziaga (76) Goals: Muniain (41) Referee: J Eriksson . A Bilbao team that were deemed to have lost their best player in Ander Herrera to Manchester United during the summer looked as comfortable as ever during the first half in Naples. Bilbao should have punished the home side  27 minutes in when an in-swinging corner found an unmarked Aymeric Laporte, but the defender failed to place his header beyond goalkeeper Rafael. That was soon forgotten when they took a deserved lead four minutes from the break. A surging Oscar de Marcos run down the right saw the midfielder square the ball to Muniain who, 10 yards out and with defenders approaching, was the epitome of cool. A first touch to set himself and a second to pass it into the bottom-right corner, the attacker  made it 1-0. Half time arrived, and Napoli had failed to register a single shot on target. In a competition where away goals come at twice the price, a change was needed. Yet Benitez decided against making a substitute, leaving season-long loan-signing Michu from Swansea City to look on from the bench for the time being. Catch me if you can: Gonzalo Higuain looked off the pace for the majority of the game but scored the equaliser . Celebration: Higuain saved Napoli's blushes in the 1-1 draw after competing for Argentina at the World Cup . Saved: The Argentina striker must now go to Spain with Napoli needing to score against Bilbao to survive the tie . CLICK HERE to read the match report from Arsenal's Champions League qualifying play-off match against Besiktas . It was France-born Higuain who saved Napoli's blushes as the striker, with three defenders for company,  squeezed his shot away into the far corner to make it 1-1. The relief was there for all to see. The home side should have made it 2-1 less than five minutes later when Jose Callejon, having beaten the offside trap, only had Gorka Iraizoz between him and goal. Yet the midfielder  only sent his shot  wide. Michu came on and could have made himself an instant hero, only to  pass to a marked Higuain instead of slotting the ball home from less than 10 yards out. It was the strangest of decisions from the 28-year-old with the goal gaping. Napoli began to look more like the home side that had lost just two Serie A games in 29 at this venue, but could not find a way past a determined Iraizoz in the Bilbao goal. The game returns for the second leg in Spain this Wednesday. Making a point: Benitez must travel to Spain with his Napoli side and score against Bilbao as it stands at 1-1 . Happy with that?

"Talented teenager Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest soccer international on Wednesday when he started against the United Arab Emirates at the age of 15 years and 253 days. The Stromsgodset midfielder, on the radar of Manchester United, Barcelona and Juventus, was in the thick of the action, creating chances for himself and others. VIDEO Scroll down to watch 15 Year old Norwegian wonder kid Martin Odegaard highlights . History: Martin Odegaard came Norway's youngest player ever, aged 15 years and 253 days . Impressive:  Teenager Oedegaard came close to breaking the deadlock in the first half . Odegaard took the field in Stavanger to break a record that had stood for over a century and almost marked his debut with a goal in a game that finished 0-0. Tormod Kjellsen was Norway's previous youngest debutant. He was aged 15 years and 351 days when he played against Sweden in 1910. 'It's incredibly huge to realise the dream that I've had since I was very, very small,' Odegaard told broadcaster MAX. 'I didn't think I'd start at all, so to play 90 minutes is good.' Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo was pleased with the teenager, who has thrilled Norwegian soccer fans since bursting onto the domestic scene. 'I think he came out of it well, and he was very close to deciding the game,' Hogmo told MAX. 'He showed the kind of qualities he has.' Starlet: Oedegaard played the entire 90 minutes against UAE and now get call up for England game . All smiles: Odegaard and Per Mathias Hoegmo are interviewed after the friendly match . Wanted: The 15-year-old, who will become Norway's youngest ever player, is attracting interest from big clubs . Staying put: Odegaard has signed a two-year contract with Stromsgodset and will remain in Norway for now . Odegaard may now be included in the squad for the upcoming friendly against England on September 3 before Norway kick off their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign at home to Italy on September 9. Odegaard has already represented Norway's Under 17 side, including appearances against the United States, France and Scotland. He signed a professional contract with Stromsgodset in May to keep him at the club for until 2015, but the two-time Norwegian champions will be bracing themselves for a bombardment of interest. Odegaard is a Liverpool fan, but has been courted by fellow European giants Bayern Munich and Manchester United. He trained with Bundesliga side Stuttgart, and is reported to have visited Manchester City last year.

"Putting your feet up while pregnant could be harmful for both mother and baby, say scientists. Experts have warned that bed rest during pregnancy has few benefits – and can lead to depression, muscle loss, and a greater risk of blood clots and diabetes. It could also result in babies having a lower weight at birth. Bed rest could put expectant mothers at risk of muscle and bone loss, diabetes, depression and blood clots, experts have warned . Issuing key guidelines, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in America said that around one in five women in the US is put on bed rest during pregnancy, often as a result of complications. However, it said, it no longer recommends routinely limiting physical activity. Co-author Anthony Sciscione, of the Delaware Centre for Maternal and Fetal Medicine, said: ‘There is no evidence bed rest improves outcomes. ‘However there is evidence bed rest can be harmful for moms, babies and families.’ Surveys show that obstetricians and gynaecologists often prescribe bed rest even though most do not believe it will do much to improve outcomes for women. It is prescribed for a variety of complications ranging from premature contractions or early labour to high blood pressure, potentially fatal pre-eclampsia, inadequate growth of the baby and for women who are at high risk of miscarriage. But the Society said bed rest has not been shown to reduce the chance of a premature delivery, either for women who are thought to be at risk or for those already in early labour. One study found premature birth actually became more common when at-risk women were placed on any type of activity restriction – either at home or in hospital. There is little data to show activity restriction is of benefit for any condition linked to pregnancy, Dr Sciscione said. For example, bed rest is often prescribed in an attempt to increase the blood flow to the placenta when the baby is not growing fast enough. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in the U.S. has also warned periods of inactivity in pregnancy could also lead to lower birth weight in babies . But studies fail to show any benefit to this practice. At the same time, there are several potentially harmful side effects of bed rest. It is widely known that doing too little activity can result in muscle and bone loss. This ‘deconditioning’ can start after only a few days and there is a lack of information on its effect on pregnant women. Bed rest may also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs – and raise the chance that clots will move to the lungs, which can be fatal. Such clots are more common among pregnant women, so limiting physical activity may compound these risks. Lack of movement may also increase a woman’s risk of gestational diabetes. The Society said that being admitted to hospital for problems during pregnancy has been associated with a higher chance of this condition. It pointed to studies which have shown that patients who are put on bed rest when not pregnant tend to develop high blood sugar levels, a key risk factor for diabetes. Bed rest also increases the risk of anxiety and depression, perhaps because of the forced inactivity. It can lead to loss of income due to inability to work and has been linked to having a baby with a lower birth weight.","Bed rest can increase an expectant mothers' risk of blood clots, depression, diabetes and having babies with a lower birth weight .

"Eavesdrop on Hampshire cricket all-rounder Will Smith and you might jump to the wrong conclusion if he uses the words ‘length’ and ‘poundage’. He is not necessarily talking about where he pitches the off-breaks that made him a valuable contributor in last summer’s T20, or the weight of his new bat. The 32-year-old is just as likely to be explaining his analysis of an afternoon’s runners. A new three-year deal has just been signed with his county but Smith is planning for a longer-term future which he hopes will be played out on a different form of turf. Hampshire cricket all-rounder Will Smith says he has been hooked on racing since he was five-years-old . Smith said he would like to go into racing punditry when he finishes playing cricket in six or seven years time . Racing fan Smith (left) talks to Sportsmail's Marcus Townend (right) at Kempton . 1 VAUTOUR: Quite simply, wins the Arkle Chase at the Cheltenham Festival by 10 lengths! 2 FAUGHEEN: Wins the Champion Hurdle by five lengths! 3 BRIAR HILL: Fell in last season’s Albert Bartlett Hurdle but had previously beaten first and third Very Wood and Apache Jack at Naas, giving them weight. 4 CAPOTE: Soft ground staying chaser who should prove better than his hurdling form. 5 ELENIKA: Very well handicapped for steeplechasing and goes well fresh. 6 CHAMPAGNE AT TARA: Will prove better upped in trip and nicely handicapped. 7 OUR JOEY: Highly rated by Cumbrian trainer George Bewley. Soft ground will suit him well. 8 MANY CLOUDS: Can win a high-class handicap chase between 2m4f-3m. 9 GOLDEN CHIEFTAIN: Ran well on reappearance at Cheltenham. Runs in Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton this afternoon. 10 SHUTTHEFRONTDOOR: Looks suited to the Grand National. On Wednesday he was the studio expert for subscription channel Racing UK, interpreting the action from Nottingham and Warwick. During the winter months, Smith can also be found offering useful advice to punters via William Hill radio. Smith has scored more than 7,000 first-class runs, won four County Championship medals (three with Durham and one with Nottinghamshire) and was a member of the Hampshire team which won this year’s Division Two to gain promotion. But he has an equal passion for horseracing. He said: ‘My father used to take me and my older brother to Towcester every Boxing Day and Easter Monday. I loved everything about a racecourse, the atmosphere, the smells. I was five or six and it got me hooked. ‘Throughout my teenage years I always studied the form in the hope of making a pound or two. I have always had an analytical mind so I enjoyed that side of it. ‘Two winters ago, I was coming into the last year of my contract with Durham. It was up in the air whether I would get another deal because of their financial troubles. ‘I thought I might have to do something else so I thought “what do I have a passion for?”’ The cricketer, who captained Durham as they retained their title in the 2009 season, said: ‘I pestered the (RUK) producer with emails and didn’t let him have a moment’s peace because I was so keen. I love doing the punditry. It is ideally where I would like to be once the cricket finishes even if, hopefully, that is another six or seven years down the line.’ Smith revealed that in 2009 he was unsure whether he would get a new Durham contract so was f . Smith has scored more than 7,000 first-class runs and has won four County Championship medals . Smith captained current England skipper Alastair Cook when the two were at Bedford School together . Smith, who took three for 15 when a losing semi-finalist in the T20 finals in August, has a cricket pedigree as rich as some of the racehorses he analyses. His fielding skills earned him a stint as a substitute fielder for England while on the Notts staff and, prior to playing for British Universities, he captained current England skipper Alastair Cook while they were contemporaries at Bedford School. Smith said: ‘He was 4ft 2in and I don’t think his voice had broken but you could tell he had a bit of talent. I was No 3 and Alastair opened with James Stedman, who went on to play hockey for England. ‘They put on numerous double hundred partnerships so I spent a lot of my time with my pads on not doing a lot.’ Smith, married to Catherine with two daughters, Ava, three, and Daisy, six months, believes his interest in racing acts as a useful diversion from the demands of the county circuit. He said: ‘If you are just watching the cricket you become a little too intense about it, or I do anyway. Also at night time you just want to switch off. ‘I go out for a meal with team-mates and then can sit back and watch the racing I have missed and catch up on the form.’ Another result at Hampshire suggests Smith has not given his team-mates too many losing tips — he was voted Players’ Player of the Year for 2014.","Will Smith has scored more than 7,000 first-class runs .

"Sharp elbows may be required when this handbag goes under the hammer - because it's the most desirable one in the world. Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and Victoria Beckham are all proud owners of iconic Hermès 'Birkin' bags, and the emergence of this unique version is sure to create a bidding war. The plush accessory is made from crocodile skin with white gold clasps and studded with diamonds, and experts say it could smash the £125,000 world record for a handbag paid in 2011. The bag, which only measures 30cm across, is set to be a record breaker, expected to reach over £125,000 . But ironically the only person who won't be interested in buying it is Jane Birkin herself - because she doesn't like them. The British actress after which the much sought-after foot-long bags are named famously denounced them as 'bloody heavy' - and said the one she owns hurts her arm. This bag - a 30cm Diamond, Matte Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin Bag - is encrusted with a whopping 245 diamonds and all the fittings are in 18-carat white gold. Experts say the bag, which is in pristine condition, is the most spectacular one ever made by the Parisian fashion house. Victoria Beckham is famously fond of the Hermes design, reportedly owning a collection worth over £1.2 million, while Kim Kardashian has so many that she uses one as a gym bag. The Diamond, Matte Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin Bag is encrusted with a whopping 245 diamonds and all the fittings are in 18-carat white gold . It is estimated to fetch $200,000 - around £125,000 - when it goes under the hammer at Heritage Auctions. In 2011 Heritage sold a red Hermes Birkin for just under £125,000, setting a world record at the time. Kathleen Guzman, managing director at Heritage Auctions, which is selling the bag, said: 'A 30cm Diamond Himalayan Birkin is possibly the rarest and most desirable handbag in the world. 'This bag is so rare and sought-after that there's a very good chance it could meet or exceed the world record price we saw three years ago. 'This is the only time that a bag of this calibre has appeared on the luxury re-sale market. This is a dream piece for the collection of true Hermes aficionados.' Sharp elbows may be required when this swanky handbag goes under the hammer in Beverly Hills this month . Every tiny detail of the luxury bag has been carefully thought out, even the base . Jane Birkin, after which the foot-long bags are named famously denounced them as 'bloody heavy' The Birkin Bag came into existence following a chance meeting on an aeroplane between Birkin and Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas in 1981. Dumas watched as Birkin struggled to get her straw bag into the overhead compartment - and when she finally did the contents fell back to the floor. Birkin, who is best known for her film roles in the 1960s and for being the partner of French singer Serge Gainsborough, explained she couldn't find a decent weekend bag. Dumas modified an existing design and in 1984 the Birkin Bag was launched. It was an instant hit with fashionistas around the world - but Birkin herself was less than impressed. In an interview in 2012 Birkin grumbled: 'What's the use of having a second one? You only need one and that busts your arm - they're bloody heavy. 'I'm going to have to have an operation for tendinitis in the shoulder.' The auction will take place on September 23 in Beverly Hills, California.","Bag is described as 'the rarest and most desirable handbag in the world'

"Too young: 11-year-old autistic boy Charlie Birely died Sunday when his family's sail boat caught fire. His parents tried in vain to pull him from the burning boat . The 11-year-old autistic boy who tragically died in a sailboat  fire on Sunday has been pictured for the first time, as his parents continue to recover at the hospital for smoke inhalation. Father Brian Birely, 59, had gone ashore around 10am that morning when he heard an explosion and saw the sailboat where he lived with his wife and two children engulfed in flames. Birely took a small boat back to the flaming ship, where he was able to save his wife Karen Laake but not their son Charlie. The couple's 13-year-old Abigail was not no the boat at the time. The father tried pulling his son over the boat by the arms but was unsuccessful. He then went to find a fire extinguisher, but by the time he came back he couldn't find Charlie. The explosion could be heard all the way to the Stuart, Florida shore. Police rushed to the scene, but were unable to get close because of intense heat. 'Officers approached the engulfed sailboat from the Stuart Police Boat and attempted to rescue anyone that may have been on board. Due to the extreme heat coming from the fire, officers were unable to go aboard and attempt a rescue,' police spokesman Officer Brian Bossio said in a prepared statement. Birely and Laake managed to make it to a small dinghy and then to shore with the help of a nearby boat. The couple was taken to a Miami hospital for treatment. Tragic inferno: A couple managed to scramble to safety as this 46-foot sailboat they call home was engulfed by flames. Their 11-year-old autistic son was not as lucky . Horrible: Brian Birely, 59, and Karen Laake, 53, were unable to pull their son--and youngest child--Charlie from the inferno started by an unknown source and made far worse when a propane tank ignited. Frank Pagnini lives on the land in Stuart near where the couple were often anchor in the St. Lucie River estuary and says he knew the family and routinely saw them plying the waters. 'Thrown debris a good distance probably. A full size propane tank exploding, people heard it down at the park,' Pagnini told WPTV. 'It was fully engulfed, front to back, the mast had already melted off.' Friends have started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the mourning family, and received more than $10,000 as of Thursday night. Charlie's parents Karen Laake and Brian Birely are still recovering in the hospital. His 13-year-old sister was not on the boat at the time . The woman who started the page says she knows Karen through work and wrote kindly of the coupe. 'They would be the first to help you in a time of need, whether they knew you or not. That's just who they are. They devoted their life to their daughter Abigail and autistic son Charlie. My heart breaks for this family in this tragic time. To not only lose your home, but the life of a very special, amazing little boy that was adored and loved by so many,' Jennell Eve wrote. What's left of the boat has been taken to a storage facility. Bossio says the state medical examiner's office was going over the wreckage Monday. City police are investigating the fire with several other agencies.

GM's system will be in over 30 models from the small Chevrolet Spark to the giant Suburban. For owners who expect minimal use of broadband, data plans start at $5 a month for 250 megabytes of data. Prices then range up to $50 a month for 10 gigabytes for the heaviest users. If you're already an AT&T subscriber, you can add your car to that plan for $10 a month. 'In addition to allowing consumers to bring in and connect to personal mobile devices, the vehicle will also act as its own mobile device, enabling embedded vehicle capabilities,' said Mary Chan, president, Global Connected Consumer, General Motors. 'Turning this vision into a reality starts with enabling fast, reliable and responsive connectivity within the vehicle,' she said. 'Through this built-in 4G LTE connection we have the opportunity to reinvent the mobile experience inside a vehicle.' The device will be an option in over 30 models from the Chevrolet Spark to the Suburban. Along with GM, Audi also is introducing 4G LTE in some models.

"Freddie Burns took to his new Tigers No 10 jersey like a duck to water - but it was Fijian flyer Vereniki Goneva who made the biggest splash at Welford Road. Burns, the 24-year-old fly-half so desperate to stay in the England mix for the World Cup after getting that unexpected chance to shine in the summer tour to New Zealand, kicked 16 points and showed great control and composure on his bow. He looks to be the ideal replacement for Toby Flood, who gave up the chance of more England caps to play for Toulouse in France. Hat-trick: Vereniki Goneva enjoyed an excellent performance, scoring a 17-minute hat-trick . Tackle: Gonzalo Tiesi is taken down by Freddie Burns during their Premiership opener . Power: Sremaia Bai is tackled by Newcastle pair Richard Mayhew and Phil Godman as Leicester won easily . Burns dictated the game as Tigers made a commanding winning start to the campaign. And they did so courtesy of wing Goneva’s three fine tries that left director of rugby Richard Cockerill crowing: ‘Niki is a fantastic finisher. He took his chances superbly and he’s happy because his parents were here. They have never watched him play outside Fiji. So they picked a good game! As for Freddie he looked sharp and will give us that special edge. . ‘It’s the perfect way to start the season with five points because this was a potential banana skin. We should be in the mix again fighting for the title.’ Tigers were without England and Lions forward Tom Croft who pulled out just before kick-off with a shoulder problem. Contract: Vereniki Goneva had looked likely to leave in the summer but Leicester persuaded him to stay . Consolation: Richard Mayhew scores Newcastle's first try, but the northerners were always playing catch-up . Burns kicked four first-half penalties to a single effort from Argentinian No 10 Juan Pablo Socino and led 12-3 at the break. But Newcastle swept over the line within seconds of the restart. Simon Hammersley weaved through and off-loaded for Richard Mayhew to run over. Manu Tuilagi then shrugged off two tacklers and off-loaded. The ball struck a Falcons player on the head and bounced for Goneva to touch down. Referee Pearce awarded the try after several replays.

"A player cut from the Cincinnati Bengals at the weekend has been re-signed by the team so that he can pay for his four-year-old daughter's cancer treatment. Defensive tackle Devon Still, 25, said he understood why he was dropped from the 53-man roster because, since learning in June that his daughter Leah has stage 4 pediatric cancer, he has struggled to concentrate on his game. 'My whole world turned upside down,' he told ABC News. But after failing to make the team on Saturday, the Bengals brought him on to the practice squad instead, which means he will still get paid and receive health insurance. Scroll down for video . 'Blessing in disguise': Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still, left during a 2012 game, failed to make the team last weekend but was signed to the practice team so he still gets health insurance for his daughter, right . 'They could have washed their hands with me and said they didn't care about what I was going through off the field,' Still said. 'It's like a blessing in disguise for me.' The move means that he will receive a weekly salary of $6,300, will have to travel less and get to spend more time with Leah, who is being treated in Philadelphia. The support from the Bengals - which includes allowing Still to miss Sunday's game in Baltimore - comes after he was out of six games last season for injuries to his elbow and back. Speaking with Bengals.com, he explained: 'They said if I keep working on my physical... and mentally prepared myself to focus on football then they can move me back up to the roster so I am not all the way out of the loop... 'Just them sticking by me through this whole time, they understand exactly what I am going through. It is a blessing I am on this organization.'

Last week, Still shared this image of her, right, as she prepared for her fourth round of chemotherapy in Philadelphia . Close: Still said he was thankful the team did not just wash their hands of him after a poor performance . Support: Still, who is pictured with his fiancee, was a second-round pick for the Bengals in 2012 . On ABC, Michael Strahan called it a 'classy, classy' move by the team. Ever since Leah's diagnosis, Still has shared images on Instagram showing her dancing in the hospital and grinning as she headed back for her fourth round of chemotherapy last week. The proud father, who is engaged, has also shaved his head in support of his daughter, who has lost her hair to her treatment. Still, who was born in New Jersey and attended Penn State, was considered one of the best defensive tackle prospects in 2012 and was picked in the second round of the draft.

"Manchester United have been stunned after Real Madrid demanded a British record fee of £75million for Angel Di Maria. The Argentina international has made the European champions aware that Old Trafford is his preferred destination and said goodbyes to his team-mates on Saturday with United growing increasingly confident of clinching a deal but the price-tag has come as a shock. They had expected a valuation of up to £56m, similar to the figures discussed by rivals Paris St Germain last week, but Madrid, sensing United's desperation to land a stellar signing, have upped the price. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United target Angel Di Maria's career highlights . On the move? Real Madrid have raised their asking price to £75million for midfielder Angel Di Maria . Wanted man: Manchester United are keen to seal a deal for the Argentina international (right) Left out: Di Maria, pictured during the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup, did not make the squad for the second leg against rivals Atletico Madrid . Seal of approval: Gary Neville believes Di Maria is the type of player Manchester United should sign . The deal is not off but, with a week left in the window, it leaves United battling against time to barter down to a figure they believe is more acceptable. Madrid's president Florentino Perez sees Di Maria as their best chance to redress their summer spending and the 26-year-old's departure would also allow them to bring in another non-EU player in Radamel Falcao from Monaco. They know United have money to spend and want to use that to squeeze out as much as possible. It would represent a huge profit on the £20m they paid Benfica for Di Maria in 2010 and, coupled with his £180,000 a week wages, represent a huge outlay for United - smashing the current British record of Chelsea's £50m for Fernando Torres in 2011. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed Di Maria said goodbye to his team-mates ahead of the impending move. 'Di Maria has not trained with us today and he came in to say goodbye to the players and people at the club,' Ancelotti told a news conference in Madrid. 'There is nothing official yet but it is being sorted out. The decision is his and the club has done what it could to keep him here.' Busy: United boss Louis van Gaal wants to strengthen his squad before the close of the transfer window . Time is up: Di Maria is expected to be a Manchester United player if the club can agree a fee with Real Madrid . The two clubs meanwhile are also in discussions over a deal for United's young right-back Guillermo Varela. The 21-year-old was David Moyes's first official signing from Penarol for £1.75m but Madrid want him to join up with Zinedine Zidane and their B team Castilla. They have asked for a loan which could become a permanent £4m deal.","Louis van Gaal looked set to capture Di Maria for £60m .

"Aby King, pictured with her Cocker Spaniel Lilly, was inspired to write a fictional book based on the Duke and Duchess' dog Lupo - published this week . It is set to be the new royal bestseller; a riproaring tale of the adventures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Cocker Spaniel Lupo. But behind the uplifting story of how cheeky Lupo does battle with the Queen’s corgi, Vulcan, lies a tale of personal tragedy. Aby King, a former actress and model whose first book The Adventures of Lupo the Royal Dog: The Secret of Windsor Castle is published this week, was inspired to write it following the loss of her fiance, Mark Sebire, a property developer who took his own life shortly before their planned wedding. She took long walks in London’s parks to help her cope with the loss and it was while walking through Kensington Palace gardens with her own Cocker Spaniel, Lilly, that Aby had the lightning idea for her book. ‘I’ve always wondered what was inside those palaces and one day when we were walking, Lilly bolted inside. I ran after her and two lovely guards came out with her. She looked very pleased with herself,’ she said. ‘The royal family inhabits a ‘secret’ behind-closed-doors world we never really get to see. I started to think about life as a royal pup, with palaces and parks at your disposal. I saw the scope for mystery and adventure - secret passageways, tunnels and portals to other times. ‘A terrific picture implanted itself in my mind of the Royal couple walking down a beach and Lupo running in the wash and he just looked like this incredibly happy, fun dog and all those things just came together in that moment of Lilly running around in the palace gardens.’ The Duchess received the dog as an early Christmas present from her parents in 2011 after he was bred from their family dog, Ella. Aby now plans a series of adventures for Lupo after Hodder Children’s Books, signed her up in a four book deal and described the series as a ‘One Hundred and One Dalmatians for today’s readers’. Negotiations are already under way for the film rights and American rights. Aby, 37, credits her dog Lilly, for the idea, but she also says she was inspired to complete the book by her own personal tragedy. In 2008 her fiancée, Mark shot himself just five weeks before their wedding amid the collapse of his business empire. He was 36 and had been suffering from depression. Aby says: ‘Suicide is like a bomb exploding. Because the person who dies leaves injured people all around them, suffering incredible pain and grief. ‘You naturally look for someone to blame. Mentally I accused every-one-creditors, Mark’s friends, even my own family - for not supporting us both more. Then I blamed myself. I was tortured about why I hadn’t seen that he was in such a state of emotional crisis.’ The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pictured with son Prince George and their Cocker Spaniel Lupo in 2013 . Lupo was given to the Duchess as an early Christmas present from her parents in 2011 - he features in this portrait with the Royal couple and their son Prince George at Kensington Palace in March 2014 . It was Lilly who comforted Aby through the bleak tragedy. After Mark’s death, Aby decided a puppy would help soothe her grief. It seemed portentous that the cocker Spaniel was born the day before the funeral. ‘It was a beacon of hope,’ Aby says. ‘The minute I got her she was the strangest thing. When I first took her home I put her on my lap and she put both her paws on my shoulders. Dogs are incredible for depression they really pep you up and in grief she really gave me a reason to keep trudging forward. . ‘She pretty much saved my life. I just remember thinking that night how lucky I was to have this little beacon of hope, because I had to take care of it. I couldn’t just wilt away, which is what I wanted to do. I had to get out of bed and walk it, feed it, take care of it and keep going. The Adventures of Lupo the Royal Dog: The Secret of Windsor Castle by Aby King is published this week . ‘She really pulled me through. She kept me alive. Otherwise I think I would have just crumbled. She is still keeping me going. Without Lilly I don’t think I would have made it, in some very dark and sad times she was amazing.’ The death of her fiance came as a particular blow to Aby because her mother Linda King, a successful model and actress in the 1960s, died of leukaemia when Aby was just 14. Aby says: ‘She was very sick. I didn’t really know what it was, and she didn’t really want us to know about it. She was determined to beat it. She fought very hard for a very long time, had endless rounds of chemotherapy. Can you imagine being this beautiful woman, come out of a divorce, want to build this wonderful future and it just went horribly wrong. ‘She did everything she could to fight it, she set up a charity called the Children’s Leukaemia Trust, she loved children, loved babies. Sarah, Duchess of York, became a huge source of support to the charity which meant a lot to my mother. She was very very helpful and once told me: 'Your mother is an incredible woman, she is so courageous, don’t ever forget that”.’ After her mother’s death in 1991 Aby and her younger brother, Oliver, went to live with their father. He later married a woman with royal connections. ‘My stepmother Rosemary King, has judged horses all over the world, and she’s an incredible woman. She worked with Princess Anne and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. She and my dad hosted hunt balls at our house in Gloucestershire.’ Inspired by Enid Blyton’s, The Magic Faraway Tree, she started scribbling fantasy and adventure stories as a schoolgirl - despite being diagnosed as dyslexic. So when she came up with the idea of The Adventures of Lupo, she knew she owed it to herself to see the project through. ‘I sat down to write and it was amazing how quickly it tumbled out, it was like I was destined to do it. During a tour of Windsor Castle it just all came together. I could feel it and the whole story just mapped out in seconds and it took just a couple of days to write; then a year to perfect it.’ Aby King says she was inspired to write the book after the death of her fiance just weeks before her wedding . She came up with the idea for the book when her own Cocker Spaniel Lilly bolted into Kensington Palace whilst out on a walk. It was Lilly who comforted Aby through the bleak tragedy of her partner Mark's death . In the first story Lupo is out for a walk with Nanny and Prince George in Kensington Gardens when accused of a serious crime he did not commit - an attack on a swan, which are protected under the Queen’s charter. In his efforts to prove his innocence, he crosses paths with a villainous corgi called Vulcan. Although several members of the Royal Family appear in the books, the focus is on the animals and their adventures. ‘It’s not about the Royal family as such, they are only mentioned fleetingly,’ says Aby. ‘I actually think the animals are far more interesting. But at the heart of these stories is the loyal bond between Lupo and the baby prince. I hope when he’s older his parents will read the books to him.’ ‘Lupo and the Secret of Windsor Castle’ out on 4 September (Hodder) www.theadventuresoflupo.com .","Aby King's first book about Royal couple's dog Lupo is published this week .

"A woman in India has given birth to ten babies at the same time - but none of them survived. Anju Kushwaha, 28, from the Satna district of central Madhya Pradesh province, went into labour at just 12 weeks on Sunday evening and was rushed to hospital with her husband Sanjay. However during the 77mile (125k) journey the expectant mother gave birth to nine children, all of them stillborn, before arriving at the hospital. Anju Kushwaha, 28, gave birth to ten babies in India in a case of multifoetal pregnancy, an increasingly common condition which mostly produces twins (file picture) Multifoetal pregnancy is where two or more embryos develop in a woman's womb, commonly resulting in twins. This can either happen as one embryo divides into two, forming identical twins, or two separate eggs are fertilised, resulting in non-identical twins. A combination of these two processes can also form triplets, all, some or none of which may be identical. However, high order multifoetal pregnancies occur almost exclusively when a woman is undergoing fertility treatment as high hormone levels and multiple implanted embryos increase the change of more than one becoming fertilised. While the rise in fertility treatment has lead to a roughly 75 per cent rise in high order pregnancies, less than 1 per cent of women are affected and cases of ten or more children are extremely uncommon. If untreated, these cases almost always result in infant death as they lead to premature birth, with the children unable to survive because their organs have not yet developed properly. Dr SK Pathak, assistant superintendent of Sanjay Ghandi Memorial hospital, told Times of India: 'She delivered nine of them midway. Obstetric and NICU team at our hospital helped her to deliver the 10th one in the operation theatre - all were born dead at almost 12 weeks.' Mrs Kushwaha was experiencing an extreme form of a condition known as multifoetal pregnancy, which usually produces twins. Multifoetal pregnancy occurs either when a single sperm and single egg combine, but then split into two embryos, forming identical twins who will share identical DNA. Another possibility is that two sperm will fertilise two eggs, resulting in non-identical, or fraternal twins, who are often different in appearance and gender. Various combinations of this process can very occasionally produce triplets, all, some or none of which might be identical. High order multiples - more than three babies in the same womb - are exceptionally rare and occur almost exclusively while the woman is undergoing fertility treatment. This is because several embryos are often implanted into her womb to increase the chances of conception, and the fact that high hormone levels, used in most fertility treatments, also increase the risk. Mrs Kushwaha has been confirmed as . receiving fertility treatment. Dr Sumitra Yadav, a senior gynecologist, . added: 'It seems that that there was no regular follow-up of her . pregnancy after IVF. At least three offspring could have been saved by . reducing the pregnancy.' High order multifoetal pregnancies, such as this one, almost exclusively occur where a woman is undergoing fertility treatment such as IVF (pictured) but are still extremely rare . Anju lives in Koti village, in Madhya Pradesh province, nearly 80 miles away from the nearest hospital meaning she miscarried nine of the babies on the way there . Multifetal pregnancy reduction is where some of the unborn children are terminated in order to increase the chance of some of the foetuses surviving, and to reduce risk to the mother. Each addition foetus a woman is carrying increases the risk of premature birth, with around half of all children born this early dying from respiratory stress syndrome, caused by undeveloped lungs. If the pregnancy is confirmed it will mark the most babies in a womb in India, and the second highest in the world. In 1971 a doctor in Rome claimed to have delivered 15 children at one time, though all of them were also dead.","Anju Kushwaha, 28, has reportedly given birth to ten babies in India .

"Roger Federer brought Flushing Meadows to its feet  by surviving a full frontal assault from mercurial Frenchman Gael Monfils to reach the semi-finals of the US Open. Federer fought off two match points in the fourth set before going on to win 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in three hours and a half hours against the No 20 seed, who could not quite find adequate composure when he had the Swiss master at his mercy. Sometimes swilling Coke at the changeovers, as is his habit, the coach-less Monfils could not convert two match points when he led 6-5 and had his opponent serving at 15-40 in the fourth set. He was reminded of the time-honoured lesson that you do not let Federer wriggle free without paying for it. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Federer v Monfils highlights .

"Britain is set to provide anti-tank weapons, night vision goggles, radar and body armour to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State jihadists. The region’s fighters say they will ask the UK for specific equipment after Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said a request for weapons would be ‘considered favourably’. An emergency meeting of EU ministers yesterday condemned the ‘atrocities and abuses’ against religious minorities – such as the Yazidis – and backed the arming of the Kurdish forces. Back up: The Kurds have requested Javelin anti-tank missiles, mortars, and heavy calibre machine guns . RAF Chinooks are already ferrying weapons supplied by other countries, including France, to Kurds in the city of Irbil, where British and US Special Forces are helping plan an offensive against the IS militants. They are also providing training in the use of the newly supplied weapons, including ‘Milan’ anti-tank missiles and Belgian-made machine guns. Kurdish fighters would like the UK to provide Javelin anti-tank missiles, mortars, heavy calibre machine guns and sniper rifles as well as body armour, night vision goggles and helmets. They may also be given a portable radar called MSTAR used to locate incoming fire and enemy positions. Britain had previously said it would only ferry weapons to the Kurds, not supply them. The change of stance could risk indirectly drawing the UK back into Iraq’s conflict. The weapons supply and training are in addition to the RAF Tornados, Hercules transport planes, other support vehicles and troops already in the region. Masrour Barzani, chancellor of the Kurdish region’s security council, said he welcomed the ‘British decision to supply us with the effective weapons that we’ve been asking for’. The EU's Foreign Affairs chief Catherine Ashton backed Britain and France arming Kurdish fighters in Iraq at an emergency Foreign Affairs Council  in Brussels today . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond is in Brussels today for emergency talks over how to arm Kurdish fighters in Iraq . An Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighter takes position on the front line 40km west of Arbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq . The Kurdish Peshmerga are used to old Soviet weapons and have so far not made any direct request for weapons from Britain . A Downing Street spokesman said yesterday: ‘Tackling the dire humanitarian situation in Iraq remains the UK’s top priority. ‘Ensuring that Kurdish forces are able to counter IS advances is also vital. We have made clear that we will consider any requests from the Iraq or Kurdistan Regional Government favourably.’ No 10 highlighted the plight of the Dahuk region in northern Iraq where 450,000 displaced people are taking shelter – a 50 per cent increase in the area’s population. Farhad Atrushi, the governor of Dahuk, said the US and UK are politically and ethically responsible for helping Iraq. He warned of the threat of ‘genocide’, adding: ‘We have hundreds of thousands [of refugees]. We’re going to face an international humanitarian catastrophe because many of these children will die. Iraq's prime minister  for the past eight years, Nouri al-Maliki (centre), speaks at a podium surrounded by Iraqi MPs yesterday. Al-Maliki stepped down in favour of fellow Dawa Party member Haider al-Abadi (stood to al-Maliki's right) Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown also welcomed the Government’s decision as he warned that conflicts in Iraq and Syria would result in redrawing Middle Eastern borders. He said the Kurds could act as a ‘northern bulwark’ against the IS, but added: ‘We are acting as handmaidens to Kurdish independence, with implications for Turkey, which is why you have to have a wider strategy.’ He told the BBC: ‘It really is time that we joined the dots. Instead of having a series of plans for a series of humanitarian catastrophes, we need to have an integrated strategy for containing a widening war.’ In Brussels yesterday, Mr Hammond hailed the announcement that Iraq’s prime minister Nouri al-Maliki was relinquishing his post, calling on his replacement Haider al-Abadi to form an inclusive government. It is hoped Mr al-Abadi will be better placed to unite Iraqis in fighting back against IS.","EU foreign ministers 'welcome' arms shipments to besieged Kurds .

"Jose Mourinho's decision to release Samuel Eto'o could prove costly  if the striker does the damage against Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday evening. With that in mind, Sportsmail have decided to take a trip back down memory lane to identify the players who have made either a good or bad impression on their first appearance for their new side. VIDEO Scroll down for Samuel Eto'o gives reasons for joining Roberto Martinez's Everton . Point to prove: Everton striker Samuel Eto'o will be hoping to score against Chelsea on Saturday . Debuts to forget . Fernando Torres (Chelsea debut) Chelsea 0 vs 1 Liverpool (6th February 2011) Chelsea’s record £50million signing failed to make the impact he would have wanted on his debut against former club Liverpool, as Chelsea slumped to a 1-0 defeat. Fernando Torres was named in a three man attack alongside Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka, which on paper looked deadly, but Torres couldn’t get off to the fairy tale start he desired. Instead Torres struggled to get into the game and saw his only effort fly high and wide, before he was replaced by Salomon Kalou on 66 minutes, met by cheers from the travelling contingent who taunted their former hero. Bad start: Fernando Torres, who looks set to join AC Milan, failed to impress against Liverpool . Teddy Sheringham – Man United debut . Tottenham 1 vs 2 Man United (10th August 1997) It was mixed emotions for Teddy Sheringham on his Manchester United debut as despite getting off to a winning start, he missed a penalty against his former club. Sheringham was jeered throughout by the home fans, but he missed his chance to silence the White Hart Lane faithful when he saw his penalty cannon back off the post, leaving the score at 0-0. Two second half United goals saved Sheringham’s blushes, but it is a moment he will not look back on fondly, and not the way he would have liked to start his United career. Penalty miss: Teddy Sheringham failed to score from the spot on his first game for Manchester United . Neil Alexander – Hearts debut . Rangers 1 vs 2 Hearts (10th August 2014) Neil Alexander spent over five years at Rangers and despite mainly being used as a second choice goalkeeper throughout his time at Ibrox, he relished his debut against his former club. This joy was short lived however, as after 67 minutes the 36-year-old was left concussed after a clash of heads with his new team-mate and was rushed to hospital. Not the way he would have envisaged his Hearts debut, but nevertheless his new side grabbed a last gasp winner earning the three points. Nightmare debut: Former Ranger goalkeeper Neil Alexander left the field with concussion on his debut . Debuts to remember . Dean Saunders – Aston Villa home debut . Aston Villa 4 vs 2 Liverpool (19th September 1992) Dean Saunders became Aston Villa’s record signing in a £2.5million deal, and he made his home debut against Liverpool, the side that had broken the British transfer record to sign him the year before. In a game that is remembered for Ronnie Rosenthal’s famous open goal miss, Saunders also grabbed some headlines himself with two goals against his former employers. This was a bitter pill to swallow for Liverpool fans, as the man who had struggled to make an impression for the reds, tore them apart on his Villa debut. Two-goal hero: Dean Saunders managed to get himself on the scoresheet against former side Liverpool . Stephane Sessegnon – West Brom debut . West Brom 3 vs 0 Sunderland (21st September 2013) Stephane Sessegnon’s West Brom debut was delayed due to his failure to obtain a work permit any earlier, which set up a fiery debut against his former club Sunderland. Paolo Di Canio criticised Sessegnon’s attitude in the build up to the game, but this only served to fire up the Benin international who came back to haunt the Italian by taking the lead for his new side 20 minutes in. His sale was not popular amongst Sunderland fans who gave Sessegnon a large ovation when his name was read out, and the new West Brom man responded by refusing to celebrate against his former club. Silencing the critics: Stephane Sessegnon done his talking on the pitch by giving his side the lead . Craig Bellamy – Man City debut . Man City 2 vs 1 Newcastle (28th January 2009) Craig Bellamy marked his £14million move to Mark Hughes’ Man City with a winning goal on his debut against former side Newcastle. Bellamy spent four years on Tyneside where he netted 42 times, but he came back to haunt his former club with an impressive display and a decisive goal as he started a new chapter at his 8th new club. Match winner: Craig Bellamy scored for Manchester City against Newcastle in the Citizens' 2-1 win . John Barnes – Charlton debut . Charlton 1 vs 0 Liverpool (13th February 1999) John Barnes enjoyed a successful 10 year spell at Liverpool and there were no hard feelings when he pulled on a Charlton shirt to make his debut against his former team. Instead this gave Barnes, who came on as a second half substitute, the chance of one more farewell to the travelling Liverpool support. It wasn’t only a testimonial game for Barnes though as his new side ran out 1-0 winners in a rare win for them in a season which saw them relegated.

Mr Gray and Mr Scott said they created the app after being inspired by Yo, which allows users to simply send the word Yo. 'The two of us had the idea at about the same time - we weren’t sold on it until we realized that usernames should be emoji too,' Gray said. 'At that point, we burst out laughing and realised we had to build it.' Emoji (selection pictured) were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online, however, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'(e) + 'letter' (moji) Earlier this year it was revealed Apple is working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the iPhone. Following complaints the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them. Because emoji have to be displayed on different devices, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium. Since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by the Unicode Consortium - a Silicon Valley-based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms, software producers, user groups and others. Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online. However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture' (e) + 'letter' (moji). Icons . are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as . a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white . flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji . representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese . curry, and sushi. Some . emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them . to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could now be added. Twitter allowed emoji to be used on its web version, as well across its apps, last month. It does this to ensure that different devices and mobile carriers can share a basic set. The latest disclosure came after Apple boss Tim Cook was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue. The diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to DoSomething.org calling on Apple to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard. 'Of the more than 800 Emojis, the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a turban,' it says. 'There's a white boy, girl, man, woman, elderly man, elderly woman, blonde boy, blonde girl and, we're pretty sure, [video game character] Princess Peach.' A petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to Apple's keyboard . 'But when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys, there's a staggering lack of minority representation.' It added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same-sex couple, and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones.","Emojli is a free app that only lets users communicate using emojis .

"Robin van Persie felt he was back in business after capping Manchester United's convincing 3-0 win over Hull with a superb final goal. The Dutchman struck for the first time in a month as he netted United's third in a one-sided Barclays Premier League encounter at Old Trafford. Van Persie's form had been the subject of heavy scrutiny ahead of the game after an ineffectual display in the previous week's win at Arsenal. Robin van Persie has admitted he 'needed' the goal against Hull to boost his confidence . Robin van Persie (left) celebrates scoring their third goal with partner Wayne Rooney (right) It was thought the 31-year-old could even lose his place with Radamel Falcao fit again after injury. But manager Louis van Gaal kept faith with his compatriot and was rewarded as Van Persie wrong-footed James Chester on the edge of the area and rifled a left-footed shot into the roof of the net after 66 minutes. 'If you score a goal like that it gives you confidence and the team, and if I am really honest I needed that,' said Van Persie, who also teed up United's second goal for Wayne Rooney. 'You just have to keep working and those goals, or any goals, will come.' United have now won three in succession in the league for the first time under Van Gaal, who described the performance as the most satisfying of his time in charge. The only obvious downside was the loss of record signing Angel di Maria early on with a hamstring injury. The Argentinian will be assessed but Van Gaal has already ruled him out of Tuesday's clash with Stoke. Van Persie  receives a hug from team-mate Rooney after scoring  at Old Trafford . Van Gaal and Van Persie give a wave to the crowd after the 3-0 win against Hull at Old Trafford on Saturday . Hull were never in Saturday's contest, with the tone set as Rooney shot narrowly wide after five minutes. Chris Smalling bundled in their deserved opener after a goalmouth scramble in the 16th minute. Goalkeeper Allan McGregor twice had chances to defuse the situation but ultimately could only help the ball over the line, as confirmed by the goal decision system. Rooney struck from the edge of the area three minutes before half-time and United's dominance could have yielded several more goals. Substitute Falcao had one of their best chances and looked certain to make it 4-0 in the dying moments but Michael Dawson blocked on the line from point-blank range. Defender Smalling agreed with Van Gaal's assessment of the game. The 25-year-old said: 'The manager said it was our best game of the season and I think it was. It was a complete performance. Di Maria leaves the pitch with an injury during the Premier League match at Old Trafford . Manchester United's Smalling scores his side's first goal of the game against Hull City on Saturday . 'I think he said of the Arsenal result that we ground that out without particularly playing well, but this time we did. 'He's said he wants six points (this week) and we want to deliver that on Tuesday against Stoke.' Smalling played alongside Marcos Rojo in a flat back four, with wingers Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young in the full-back positions. Van Gaal has previously shown preference for a three-man defence but felt he had the flexibility to adapt because players are growing used to his philosophy. The United manager said: 'It is not (about) methods, it is philosophy. We have to perform because of that philosophy and then you can play in different formations, and that we are doing. 'It is also dependent on the quality of the opponent. We selected the right formation I think to beat a team with five defenders.' Rooney (left) shoots to score their second goal during the  Premier League match between United and Hull . Rooney runs away in celebration after United go 2-0 up on a comfortable afternoon for the home side . Hull had just 23 per cent of possession during the game and were ruthlessly punished for their defensive mistakes. After beginning the season with confidence following last season's comfortable survival and FA Cup final appearance, the Tigers' form is now a cause for concern. Steve Bruce's men are without a win in six matches and have lost their last four. They only stayed outside the bottom three on goal difference on Saturday night. Former Tottenham defender Dawson told Tigers TV: 'It is always a worry because you are down there. You have to win football matches to get out of it. 'People are talking about having the best squad here for many years, but it is only the best squad if we make it the best squad. 'The points table at the end of the season will define that. 'But we can't get too down. We have to pick ourselves up because the games come thick and fast in December. We have got to stick together. Losing here is not going to define our season.'","Manchester United beat Hull City 3-0 at Old Trafford in Premier League .

"The Scottish Rugby Union are urging all former international players to take part in a ground-breaking study set up to investigate the long-term effects on the brain of playing the sport. Research into American Football has shown former players are four times more likely to suffer conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Motor Neurone Disease — which sparked the Ice Bucket Challenge online phenomenon. There are fears rugby and other contact sports could also be at risk. Rugby authorities have attempted to play down parallels with the NFL, insisting helmeted sports cannot be compared with non-helmeted ones, but there is mounting evidence rugby has a comparable concussion rate to American Football. Leading by example: Former Scotland captain Chris Paterson is one of several players who have signed up . Progress: Dr James Robson has played a huge part in the SRU's work to bring in better safety measures . The SRU, led by the highly-regarded Dr James Robson, have been at the forefront of driving concussion safety measures and the latest attempt to set up a detailed study led by researchers at Glasgow University is set to be copied by other unions, including the RFU. Former Scotland captain Chris Paterson is one of several players who has already signed up to the study. ‘Our sport is doing everything it can to lead the way on understanding concussion for future generations at all levels of the game,’ Paterson said. Star man: Paterson scored over 800 points for Scotland during a long and successful international career . The International Rugby Board established a trial in Auckland more than two years ago which was meant to be published last September. So far no data has been presented despite promises from chief executive Brett Gosper that there ‘will be no cover up’. Similar studies in football have also failed to deliver any meaningful data. ‘It is very encouraging to see our unions actively engaged in assisting research into head injuries and I would appeal to former elite players to come forward and take part in this University of Glasgow study, which is being supported by the Scottish RU,’ said IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset.

"U.S. officials say a commercial aircraft chartered by the U.S.-led military in Afghanistan was ordered to land in Iran after being told its flight plan was out of date, or else be 'forced down' by Iranian fighter jets. The plane - a Boeing 737 chartered from airline Fly Dubai - was flying from Bagram airfield, north of Kabul in Afghanistan, to Dubai on Friday. The normal flight path goes through Iranian airspace. One official says Iranians radioed the plane's crew to say they did not have the proper paperwork and to return to Bagram. The pilots said they did not have enough fuel to return, so the Iranian authorities told them to land in Iran or 'be intercepted'. Forced down: A charter airplane carrying 140 military contractors - including 100 U.S. citizens - from Afghanistan to Dubai was ordered to land in Iran Friday after its pilots were told the flight plan was out of date . According to NBC, Iranian ground control officers ordered the plane to land at the airport in Bandar Abbas in southern Iran. They threatened to force the plane down using fighter jets, according to reports. The pilot then voluntary landed in Bandar Abbas. There were 140 people aboard the plane, 100 of them Americans, CNN noted. There were also said to be two Canadians on board. The flight routinely flies contractors from Afghanistan to Dubai. Initial reports that the plane had been charted by the Pentagon were incorrect, officials said. A senior State Department official says the issue appears to have been resolved and the plane is expected to take off again Friday afternoon. The officials are not authorized to be named and spoke on condition of anonymity. The airline, Fly Dubai, will likely have to pay a fine to Iran and buy Iranian fuel, NBC reported.","Boeing 737 from commercial airline Fly Dubai chartered by US-led military in Afghanistan .

"Former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, 59, allegedly went on a expletive-laden rant at his intelligence chief during a 2007 crisis meeting . The arch-federalist who David Cameron wants to block from a top EU job was accused of a 'dead drunk' expletive-laden outburst against his intelligence chief. Jean-Claude Juncker - frontrunner to be the next European Commission President - allegedly made the rant during a meeting about a scandal which rocked his term as Prime Minister of Luxembourg. The claims emerged in a 14-page missive which was written in German by a former intelligence agent and leaked to the media in Luxembourg. The document, the content of which has not been verified, claimed Mr Juncker called the meeting in 2007 with Marco Mille, the head of the intelligence service in Luxembourg. Both Juncker and Mille were battling headlines at the time over alleged illegal wiretaps by the Luxembourg security services. Though Mr Juncker denied wrongdoing, his junior coalition partners withdrew their support with critics saying he had to take political responsibility. Mr Juncker called fresh elections - before handing in his resignation last summer. Leaked to the Luxembourg news magazine Paperjam, the document says: 'Towards evening we arrived at his office. 'It smelled of stale tobacco and an alarming scent of alcohol was in the air. Half staggering, he stepped out from behind his cluttered desk. 'Juncker was dead drunk, ordered himself two espresso and asked us to take a seat at the table. 'Without introductory words he began to insult Mille: ""I f*** around where, whom, and when I want, do you understand me? '""You could f***, but you cannot really do it, your German correctness... it forbids you."" 'For about five minutes Juncker continued his massive offensive against Mille.' It adds: 'After Juncker had drunk the two expresso... he went to the window several times to get some fresh air. He gradually calmed down.' A leaked 14-page missive claims Mr Juncker, pictured with Chancellor George Osborne, was 'dead drunk' during the outburst. He  is frontrunner to be next European Commission President -  a move criticised by Tories . The account bore the name of André Kemmer, a former agent with Luxembourg's security services. It was leaked to Paperjam in December and resurfaced today in The Times, which spoke to the intelligence service's former head of operations Franck Schneider. Mr Schneider stood by the account, saying: 'The meeting took place exactly as Kemmer described it in the document. Mr Cameron has privately said Mr Juncker 'cannot solve the problems of the next five years' 'It was unreal. He was very aggressive, very vulgar. I cannot say whether he was sloshed or stressed-out but he was not in his normal state.' When the document was leaked, Luxembourg's media quoted the author as saying he had never intended it to be published. Instead it was the first draft of a book which was meant to be a personal note of what happened, he said. Mr Juncker, meanwhile, was quoted by Der Spiegel as denying the document's contents and said it being leaked to the media was a 'destabilising manoeuvre' to try and unseat him. A spokesman for Mr Juncker told MailOnline: 'Mr Juncker's office will not engage on these issues.' Mr Mille and Mr Schneider did not respond to requests for comment by MailOnline. A founding father of the Euro who is proud to be called a federalist, Mr Juncker is the worst nightmare of Westminster's Eurosceptics. The former Luxembourg prime minister’s bid for the top Brussels job has been strongly criticised by David Cameron, who said Britain could quit the EU if Mr Juncker was to succeed. Mr Cameron has privately branded Mr Juncker a ‘face from the 1980s’ who ‘cannot solve the problems of the next five years’. He said Europe could not stick ‘its head in the sand’ and ignore the growing tide of Euroscepticism. Mr Juncker, meanwhile, has fought back. He reportedly told a closed meeting of the European People’s Party in the parliament in Brussels this week: ‘It is wrong if we give in to the British. 'I will not be forced to get on my knees before the British. What bothers me is the gathering British press campaign.'","Jean-Claude Juncker was Luxembourg's PM during the 2007 incident .

"Daredevil surfers are flocking to the coast of Portugal to ride giant waves up to 100-foot high. Incredible photos show the thrill-seekers riding the huge swells off the coast of Nazare, a fishing town north of Lisbon. A 125-mile long underwater canyon - which is up to three miles deep - combines with strong Atlantic currents to create the enormous waves. Scroll down for video . A deep underwater canyon and strong currents sweeping in from the Atlantic Ocean create huge, 100-metre waves off the coast of Nazare, Portugal at this time of year . Pictures taken by photographer Rui Boino show surfers dwarfed by the huge wages, which crash around them as they try to stay on their surfboards . Extreme surfers are flocking to the coastline to ride the massive swells, which also attract spectators who marvel at the incredible natural forces on display . London-based photographer Rui Boino captured images of brave surfers attempting to conquer the huge swells. The 38-year-old said: 'I always try to capture the unique expression, emotions and reactions from the subject. I loved photographing Nazare, despite the loud crashing of the waves, I find it so relaxing. You need to be there to see and feel the power.' In the peak summer months, the beaches of Nazare attract thousands of sun-seekers, but the scene transforms in the autumn and winter, as the Atlantic winds pick up, causing the waves to grow in size and power. World famous American surfer Garrett McNamara, 47, is currently taking on the waves with friends. In January 2013, Garrett broke the world record for the largest wave ever surfed at Nazare,  riding a  100ft swell. Mr Boino added: 'Although beautiful, the power of waves is one of the most significant forces of coastal change. Whilst waves are great to watch for its strength and magnitude they are destructive too.'

"Tattooed police officers in San Antonio are being ordered to cover up - or pay up. From the start of this month, the city's police department is ordering officers with visible tattoos that cannot be hidden to have the body art medically removed at their own expense. The move is part of an effort to make police officers at the Texas department  appear more professional. Police officers will be forced to pay for medical tattoo removals out of their own pocket . Officers with tattoos on their arms will be allowed to wear sleeves to keep the body art hidden, reports the San Antonio Express-News.

"An Idaho State University assistant professor accidentally shot himself in the foot during class with a semiautomatic handgun he was carrying inside his pocket, police said on Wednesday. Shot: Byron Bennett shot himself in the foot during class . Byron Bennett was giving a lecture to 20 students when his small caliber pistol discharged in the Physical Science Complex just before 4pm, according to Pocatello Police Lieutenant Paul Manning. The injured teacher was was treated and released from a local hospital, and possessed a so-called enhanced concealed-carry permit that allowed him to carry a hidden gun on campus under a state law that went into effect on July 1. Bennett has taught at the school since 2007 and earned his doctorate in organometallic chemistry at the University of Wyoming in 1997. The highly qualified chemist has 24 publications to his credit and has collaborated with 37 co-authors between 1995 and 2010. Bennett has also been cited by 159 authors, according to Academic Search writes the Idaho State Journal. He has declined to comment about the accident. An investigation is underway to determine if he will be charged with a misdemeanor for discharging a firearm within city limits, the Idaho State Journal reports. Idaho’s Republican-led legislature passed the law allowing guns on university grounds earlier this year over the objection of the presidents of the state’s leading universities, including Idaho State, which was routinely ranked as one of the safest campuses in the United States. In response to the new law, the university for the first time dispatched public safety officers armed with semiautomatic pistols to patrol the university’s southeastern Idaho campus this summer to safeguard students and staff. Investigation: Idaho State University have said this is the first time a professor has shot himself in the foot during class . Those officers and Pocatello police responded to Tuesday's shooting, which college spokeswoman Adrienne King said did not pose an imminent threat to the school of 14,000 students nor require a lockdown or evacuations. An examination of records dating to 1997 showed no other reports of an accidental shooting on campus, she said. Manning said authorities are investigating why the small-caliber weapon discharged, whether it was fitted with a safety device and if the device was engaged at the time of the incident. Guns are banned in areas of the physical science complex where there is nuclear research but are allowed under the new law in the chemistry lab where the firearm went off, King said. Twenty students are enrolled in the chemistry course but it was unclear how many were on hand when the incident took place, King said. 'Idaho State University is in compliance with the Idaho gun law. Yesterday’s incident was an unfortunate accident,' university President Arthur Vailas said in a statement. The university is likely to conduct an administrative review of the incident after a probe by Pocatello police, officials said.",Professor Byron Bennett was treated and released from hospital on Wednesday .
"An eight-year-old boy was caught trying to smuggle a pet turtle through airport customs in his underwear. The boy, named Congcong, and his grandmother were going through  security when his grandmother told him to let the turtle go as pets weren't allowed on their flight from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Congcong was so enamored with the turtle, that he refused to let go of it, at the last minute secretly stuffing the reptile into his underwear, hoping he could smuggle it onto the plane. A turtle-y different way to travel: The turtle was found by airport security, stuffed into Congcong's underwear . But the plucky lad was busted when security officials noticed something moving in his underpants. Baffled by the bulge, the airport staff asked the boy if we was hiding something, and Congcong became nervous, attempting to hide the turtle with his hands. According to an airport spokesman: 'She (the grandmother) had told him to leave the pet behind but he had disobeyed her and tried to smuggle it on board the plane. Security officials at Guangzhou International Airport became suspicious when they saw a moving bulge .

'When the customs officials noticed he was trying to hide something, he tried to cover it up, and when his grandma asked him what he was hiding he tried to cover it up even more.' After inspecting his underpants, security staff found the frightened turtle nestled inside, moving its head from side-to-side, the Guangzhou Daily reports. The small, yellow reptile was removed from the boy, who was also checked as he had a red patch of skin where the turtle had been hiding. Both boy and turtle were found to be in good health. And luckily for Congcong, airport officials agreed to let the animal travel in the cargo area and be delivered to his parents. It's not the first time the airport has busted a passenger trying to sneak something scaly through security.

"Every morning, I wake up and 'put on my face', as my mother used to call it. I even out my freckly skin with foundation, bring my cheeks to life with blusher, and give my blonde eyelashes definition with lots of mascara. On a good day, I'll take a stab at eyeliner and eyeshadow. but to be honest I'm not sure why I bother. Within hours of applying make-up, I am a smudgy mess. I have very oily, sweaty skin, so nothing sticks, despite applying loose and pressed powder throughout the day. Scroll down for video . Made-up: Marianne when the make-up was first applied, left, and 24 hours later . My eyeshadow gathers into shiny, tiny creases, my mascara and eyeliner moves south, and my foundation disappears. I'm often tempted not to bother at all. But now, apparently, there is an answer. When Yves Saint Laurent launched its Fusion Ink Foundation a few weeks ago, nearly 12,000 women clamoured to get on the waiting list. The reason? It claims to use space-age technology that makes it last for 24 hours. The high-tech base contains lipophilic acid, which is so absorbent it's used by Nasa to 'soak up' space dust so that it doesn't affect the outer casings of a rocket. The same substance also, apparently, sucks grease from the face, helping make-up last much longer. And YSL isn't the only one - look in Boots' make-up aisle and you'll find 24-hour lipsticks, mascaras and eyeshadows from a multitude of cheap and cheerful brands. But do any of them actually stay put for an entire day and night? I put some to the test... 6am . Out of the world: YLS's Fusion Ink Foundation has ingredients used by Nasa . I've never applied so much make-up this early. I start with foundation. As well as the space-age ingredients, YSL's Fusion Ink Foundation (Boots, £30.50) contains a 'hydrophilic agent' - a clay-like mix of minerals that the company claim acts like 'an invisible sponge', soaking up moisture from the face. It's surprisingly thin and watery, compared with my usual, creamy foundation, and sinks straight in, leaving a chalky finish. I top it up with Maybelline SuperStay 24-hour Waterproof powder (£6.99), which promises 'flawless coverage and shine control all day long'. Then, the eyes. Maybelline's Color Tattoo 24-Hour Eyeshadow (£4.99, Boots) claims 'up to 24 hours staying-power' and 'innovative pigment technology for a super-saturated colour'. The little pots of gel cream shadow can be applied with fingers or a brush. I use a bronze base with a smokey silver on top. The soft colours go on easily and feel like they're going to stay put. This is topped off with Rimmel Scandal eyes 24-hour gel eyeliner (£6.99, Boots), which promises 'up to 24 hours of rich, intense colour that doesn't flake, smudge, smear or run', and lashings of Clinique's Lash Power Mascara (£18). The mascara wand is tiny, so you have to layer it up, but it vows to 'look pretty for 24 hours without a smudge or smear. Lasts through rain, sweat, humidity, tears’. What more could a girl want? Well, rosy cheeks and a perfect pout, of course! Rimmel's Stay Blushed is a cream blusher, claiming to 'create a long-lasting, natural-looking flush of colour that lasts up to 24 hours' (£4.49, Superdrug). It has a much denser colour than I’m used to, and feels sticky, but it blends in quite well and the colour is pretty. Finally, the lips. I'm a disaster with lipstick, so I usually just go for lipgloss. But Max Factor Lipfinity (Boots, £10.99) sounds perfect. It consists of a lip stain, applied once, and a waxy lip balm, applied throughout the day to keep lips moist. The stain goes on easily, and the colour is strong. But my lips feel dry - you need the balm on top. An hour later, I'm ready to go. 12pm . The powder seems to have fallen at the first post. It really didn't last long - no more than an hour. The foundation seems to be staying put, but, because the powder's given up, I'm now very shiny. The lip colour has done surprisingly well, although it's gone from hot to lukewarm pink. My cheeks have faded in colour, but the eye make-up is immaculate. The liner, mascara and eyeshadow are exactly the same as when I applied them this morning. Very impressive. No need to reapply: Max Factor Lipfinity claims to last 24 hours . 6pm . The shine continues! I feel like there's an oil slick starting in my T-zone and spreading across my face. The cheek colour has gone. The pink of my lips is coming away in patches, but it's largely still there. And though the foundation is very thin, I can feel it sitting on my skin; I feel like my skin can't breathe. The eyes, however, are a miracle! The liner on the bottom lashline has smudged slightly, but the top is immaculate, and there is no creasing with the eye colour. The mascara is perfect. Midnight . It's the end of a long day. The eyeliner has smudged more below my eyes and my eyeshadow is vanishing. After dinner and drinks, my lip colour is barely there - and brushing my teeth doesn't help. I really want to wash my face, too, but I don't. Instead, I go to bed with my space-age foundation and smokey eyes, and worry what the state of my pillows - and my pores - will be in the morning. I get spots easily if I don't keep my skin very clean, so I'm sure I'll wake up with breakouts. 7am . Oh dear! Nobody needs to wake up to this vision in the mirror. I have big smudges under my eyes and the remaining eye colour seems to have gathered in clumps. There is one, lone, pink dot on my lips. But the mascara is immaculate - it hasn't smudged or broken off, and my lashes are perfectly curly. I can still feel the foundation on my skin which, I suppose, is the aim, but I can't wait to get it off. I run to the shower and use my most industrial-strength scrub. VERDICT . Top marks: Marianne was the most impressed with the Maybelline eyeshadow and Clinique mascara . Foundation . Claim: 24 hours . Reality: 24 hours . Because the foundation is light and natural-looking, it's hard to tell if it stayed for 24 hours - I think it did. However, the product promises '24 hours of soft-matte perfection', which was not the case for me in terms of shine. Powder . Claim: 24 hours . Reality: 1 hour . Very disappointing - within an hour of doing errands on a sunny day, my skin was very shiny. Eyeliner . Claim: 24 hours . Reality: 16 hours . It began to smudge underneath by the end of the day, but the top line stayed perfect for 24 hours. Eyeshadow . Claim: 24 hours . Reality: 20 hours . The colour started to come off by the end of the day, but there was some left on my lids after 24 hours - it was just clumpy. Impressive. Mascara . Claim: 24 hours . Reality: 24 hours . It did not budge. My lashes stayed perfectly curly. A brilliant product. Blusher . Claim: 24 hours . Reality: 7 hours . Very disappointing - the colour faded quickly and vanished by the late afternoon. Lips . Claim: 24 hours . Reality: 15 hours . I kept a fairly strong colour for most of the day - much more than with a normal lipstick - but this couldn't survive dinner and teeth-brushing.","YSL's Fusion Ink Foundation claims to use space-age technology .

"A large footprint unlike one from a human or bear has been found in the woods in Mississippi - raising suggestions that the creature it belongs to is Bigfoot. The large print was found by Peyton Lassiter in Vicksburg on August 12 - nine months after another local man, David Childers, saw a large grey figure running through a wooded area nearby. Lassiter had been working on an air conditioner 400 yards from an abandoned playground that borders the woods when he came across the footprint and made a cast of it. The cast - which trapped white-gray hairs from the animal - measures nine inches long and is almost six inches wide at the toes, The Jackson Clarion-Ledger reported. Discovery: Peyton Lassiter shows the cast he made from a large footprint he found near to a wooded area in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He said the ridges on the footprint mean it was not made by a bear . Found: Lassiter, right, contacted paranormal investigator David Childers, left, after making the discovery last month and learned that Childers had seen a mysterious gray figure in the woods last year . 'That right there isn't human,' Lassiter told WLBT, pointing to the print. Not only does the color of the hair fail to match a bear's, but he also noted there were fingerprint-like ridges in the cast - a feature found only on humans and primates, he said. 'I have no knowledge of what made it, and I didn't see what made it, but it's very intriguing,' he said. He contacted Childers, co-founder of the Delta Paranormal Project, when he saw his truck marked with the project's logo. On speaking to him, he learned Childers could have seen the creature responsible for the print. 'We were just blown away,' Lassiter told the Clarion-Ledge. 'That kind of brought some clarity to what we were dealing with. In other words, it raised additional questions.' Found: The cast also pulled out a gray-white hair from the footprint, suggesting it was not a bear . Sighting: Childers said last November he saw the six-foot-tall creature see him and then dash into the woods . Scene: The sightings occurred near this run-down playground, an area where hunting is not allowed . Childers explained that he had seen the creature as he tried to film some paranormal activity at the playground, claiming he had previously heard children's voices there. Instead, he said he heard a crashing noise in the woods - and was stunned by what he saw: a 6ft-tall creature running through the woods. 'It was definitely a shaggy coat to it, like a grayish-brown color,' he said. 'When it made the noise that spooked me, I looked over, and it looked like it stood up and just bolted off.' He said that it happened so quickly that he did not have the chance to take pictures. While he has long hunted for paranormal activity - even appearing on network A&E with his finds - he would not say whether he believed it could be Bigfoot. Search: Childers' group, The Delta Paranormal Project, is now investigating the area further . But 'if you have a piece of physical evidence such as this it's definitely worth not totally ruling out', Lassiter told WJTV. Both men agree that whatever it is, it must be smart enough to have avoided being seen. Lassiter said he has found previously recorded sights in the area, reaching from 1721, when a priest wrote about seeing a huge human-like creature in Natchez. The Delta Paranormal Research group is now planning to investigate the area further.","Peton Lassiter spotted a nine inch by six inch footprint in Vicksberg, Mississippi in August and took a cast of it .

"Three Americans being held by the North Korean government have given their second interview from captivity in Pyongyang and said their plight is 'urgent.' Matthew Todd Miller, Jeffrey Edward Fowle and Kenneth Bae begged the U.S. government for help - asking that the State Department send a special envoy to North Korea to negotiate on their behalf. A CNN TV crew and the Associated Press were given access to the men Monday. It is only the second time that Mr Miller and Mr Fowle have been seen by Western media since they were detained in April. Scroll down for video . Kenneth Bae, who has been detained in North Korea for nearly two years, said he works in a labor camp six days a week, eight hours a day . Asking for help: Matthew Miller (left) and Kenneth Fowle (right) both traveled to North Korea as tourists. They stand trial next month and could be sent to prison . Both men said they face trial in a month and will likely be sent to prison immediately thereafter. Mr Bae has been held since November 2012 and was convicted in April 2013 of forming a Christian plot to overthrow the government. 'My situation is very urgent, that very soon I am going to trial, and I would directly be sent to prison,' Mr Miller told CNN. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor and currently works eight hours a day, six days a week at a camp in Pyongyang, he said. Mr Miller was detained after he arrived at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport and tore up his tourist visa. He reportedly requested asylum in the hermit kingdom and said he had chosen North Korea 'as a shelter.' Mr Fowle, a father-of-three from Ohio, is accused of leaving a Bible at a nightclub during a tourist trip to North Korea. Last month, Mr Miller appeared humbled on video. No looking into the camera, he said: 'I am now requesting help from the American government, the citizens of America and the world to release me from this situation.' Mr Miller and Mr Fowle are being held at a hotel in Pyongyang and said they are allowed outside for on hour each day and given three meals a day. Facing court: Mr Miller reportedly flew to Pyongyang as a tourist, then ripped up his visa and requested asylum from the brutal dictatorship . Mr Bae said that despite being forced to work in a labor camp, he is being treated 'as humanely as possible.' In a truly North Korean twist, he revealed that he is the only worker at the labor camp and his labor is supervised by 20 government officials - including guards and a doctor. He asked Americans to pray for him and that he is allowed to return hoe to the United States. All three men said they have signed confessions after being coerced by their captors. A CNN TV crew was in Pyongyang as part of a government-sponsored tour of the country. Reporter Will Ripley said in the midst of an activity, he and his crew were whisked away in an unmarked van and told they would be meeting with a top North Korean official. When they arrived at a Pyongyang hotel, they found not an official, but instead, the three American captives. CNN was allowed to speak to each captive for five minutes. This is the second time in two months, Western media has been allowed access to the hostages. Last month, Mr Miller and Mr Fowle met with an AP news crew and gave similar interviews. A State Department official told MailOnline last month: 'Out of humanitarian concern for Mr Miller, Mr Fowle, and their families, we request the DPRK (North Korea) release them so they may return home.' The United States has no embassy in North Korea - but is working through the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang to keep in touch to the captives and help secure their release. Mr Miller was arrested after arriving at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport and declaring he had chosen to seek 'shelter' in North Korea . The State Department said officials are in 'regular contact' with the families of the two detained men. Little is known about Mr Miller. The State Department has refused to say where he is from or identify his family. North . Korea's state-run media have said the 24-year-old entered the country . April 10 with a tourist visa, but tore it up at the airport and shouted . that he wanted to seek asylum. He traveled to North Korea after purchasing a private tour of Uri Tours, a New Jersey-based company that runs tours to the reclusive nation. In an update in April posted to the company's website, Uri Tours said it had repeatedly tried to reach the family member Mr Miller listed a his emergency contact information, had gotten no response. To date, no members of Mr Miller's family have come forward publicly to ask for his release.","Matthew Miller was arrested on April 10 after he tore up his tourist visa and said he wanted to 'take shelter' in North Korea .

"A controversial colouring book company have re-released their children's anti-terrorism series to include references to ISIS terrorists. The books, designed by U.S. company Really Big Coloring Books, feature images such as the crucifixion of a Christian by a member of ISIS and the assassination of Osama Bin Laden. Company founder Wayne Bell said the  books are designed to help explain to children what is happening in the world today. Really Big Coloring Books has published a new range of anti-terror books aimed at children including references to ISIS, such as this map, which lists America as 'Histories [sic] Greatest Nation' The new books also include pictures of the five terrorists exchanged for U.S. prisoner Bowe Bergdahl. Wayne Bell, founder of the publisher, says the designs are aimed at explaining world events to youngsters . Also included in the most recent books are a map of terrorist groups and dictators around the world and a picture of the five Taliban detainees released in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The company says its books are aimed at children, but does advise adult supervision. Mr Bell said: 'The reactions differ across the board - some love these books and some simply do not want them at all. 'The original, published in 2011, has sold in over 120 countries and all of these books are profitable. Other books include drawings promoting branches of the U.S. military including their mottoes . Another controversial book featured this copy of the infamous Rolling Stone cover featuring Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with the headline 'Rock Him and Stone Him' 'I personally wish I never made a book on terror for children - not because I am ashamed of them but because the books are painful for so many, the truth hurts. 'It's such a sad state of affairs in America and across the world that parents would ask for, or ever need, a product on terrorism.' Alongside their politically-charged titles, the company also produces other books themed around fairies and princesses. Really Big Coloring Books grabbed attention with the release 'We Shall Never Forget 9/11: The Kids' Book of Freedom' shortly after 9/11.

"It's not quite now or never for Danny Welbeck, but there's no escaping Monday's move to Arsenal is a watershed moment for the forward. So often on the peripheries at Manchester United, he will now be thrust into the spotlight at the Emirates Stadium. He was desperate for a chance to prove he is good enough to play regularly as a central striker at Old Trafford, but he was more often than deployed out wide. VIDEO Scroll down for a Q&A with Arsenal new boy Danny Welbeck & Wayne Rooney . Frustration: Danny Welbeck has been craving an opportunity to play as a centre forward . The shirt fits: Danny Welbeck in his new shirt after the club sealed a £16m deal . Got your number: Welbeck shows off his new No 23 Gunners shirt . Arsenal have several options over who to play as their central striker... but each player comes with a problem: . Olivier Giroud - Frenchman is proven striker but is out injured until the New Year . Danny Welbeck - £16 new signing is welcome boost but remains unfulfilled talent . Alexis Sanchez - £35m summer buy is top-class but is he really a centre forward? Yaya Sanogo - Young Frenchman is powerful but is raw and has failed to score for the club . Theo Walcott - England star has pace to burn and great talent, but is preferred out wide . Lukas Podolski - A German World Cup winner but was set to be sold as out of favour . So, here's his chance. He must grasp it. Olivier Giroud's lay-off with an ankle injury means Welbeck will be asked to fill Arsenal's vacant central-striker role - at least until the France international is available in four months. It's the opportunity he's always wanted. At United there were too many obstacles - Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie to name but two. But, for the next four months, there's nothing preventing Welbeck from dismantling the belief that he isn't equipped to be the main man at a top-four club. The first person he has to prove that to is his new manager. Arsene Wenger is a long-term Welbeck admirer, but luring him away from United always seemed more like a pipe dream than a reality. So when news emerged last month that the England international was available, Wenger was immediately on the case. Welcome to Arsenal: Jack Wilshere and Wlbeck will now form a double act for both club and country . On the move: Roy Hodgson (right) watches Welbeck take on Wayne Rooney during England training . Manchester United . Appearances: 142 . Goals: 29 . Sunderland (loan) Appearances: 28 . Goals: 6 . Preston North End (loan) Appearances: 8 . Goals: 2 . England . Caps: 26 . Goals: 8 . Arsenal's original decision to sell Lukas Podolski in the transfer window was made, in part, with Welbeck in mind. The original plan was to replace the Germany international with Welbeck. Like Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes and Roy Hodgson before him, Wenger has always viewed Welbeck - like he does Podolski - as a wide player capable of cutting in from the flank to provide a goal threat. But Giroud's injury has resulted in a change of tact from the Gunners. The Frenchman's broken ankle saw Arsenal postpone their plan to sell Podolski, meaning the move for Welbeck was put on the back burner as the club focused on signing a new out-and-out striker. They tried and failed to sign Loic Remy from Queens Park Rangers. They tried and failed to sign Radamel Falcao from Monaco. One that got away: Radamel Falcao (left) joined Manchester United on loan rather than the Gunners . Another one that got away: Loic Remy chose to sign for Chelsea during the transfer window . So, when Wenger gave the green light to a move for Welbeck on Saturday morning, he did so having changed his mind about the forward. He had now earmarked the United man as his new central striker. Yes, it's clear Welbeck was not the club's first-choice, but it is now down to the forward to prove Arsenal were right to take the gamble. Because, essentially, that's what it is: a gamble. A gamble on a player who has not played as the No 1 striker for a top club yet. Inside the dressing room: Arsene Wenger (left)  before the Interreligious Match For Peace in Rome on Monday . He is certainly equipped to prove his point. Powerful, quick and with an eye for goal - at Arsenal he has a midfield that will create chances galore for him. The fact thousands of United fans have voiced their discontent at the club's decision to let Welbeck leave tells its own story. It's not merely the fact that he is a United academy graduate (the decision to offload Tom Cleverley doesn't seem to have been met with the same discontent). But it's the realisation that Welbeck's move could easily backfire on United that has United fans on edge .","Danny Welbeck has joined Arsenal from Manchester United for £16m .

"Angel Di Maria remains tantalisingly close to swapping Real Madrid for Manchester United as Louis van Gaal looks to break his less-than-impressive Premier League start with a big-money buy. But where will Di Maria fit in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation? Is he really worth £75million? Can he become a No 7 at Old Trafford to rank alongside David Beckham or Cristiano Ronaldo? Sportsmail's Pete Jenson explains what the Argentina star will be bringing to Manchester. WATCH Scroll down for Angel di Maria's career highlights ahead of his United move . Almost: Angel di Maria is set to become a Manchester United player in a £75m swap from Real Madrid . De Gea . Jones - Evans - Rojo . Rafael - Mata - Fletcher - Di Maria - Shaw . Rooney - Van Persie . However... Di Maria is known for his versatility. The 26-year-old can play in central midfield, in a front three, as a left wing-back or even as an emergency left-back. Almost every tactical shift in Van Gaal’s big black folder will have a place for Di Maria. Where will Di Maria play? The most logical position for Di Maria to play in Van Gaal’s 3-5-2 is in the midfield five, just inside the left-wing back. Luke Shaw will eventually operate wide left of the five and Di Maria would play to his right. Last season he played on the left of the midfield three at Real Madrid and he had his best season at the club. He has the engine to get up and down the pitch covering the runs of the left wing-back when necessary, just as he did last season filling the gaps left by Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao going forward. He was also able to make runs from a central position out to the left touchline and get around the back of teams. He gave Real Madrid dynamism and an unpredictability in attack that United look like they desperately lack. In a 3-5-2 with Phil Jones, Jonny Evans, Marcos Rojo in defence, Rafael, Juan Mata or Ander Herrera, Darren Fletcher, and Shaw in midfield, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie up front he would be very much at home. On his way? United are hoping to secure the signature of Real midfielder Di Maria in the next two days . Like a glove: Di Maria would fit into Louis van Gaal's 3-5-2 by sitting inside the man down the left in midfield . BORN: Argentina, February 14 1988 (26) 2005-2007: Rosario Central (35 apps, 6 gls) 2007-2010: Benfica (76, 7) 2010-NOW: Real Madrid (124, 22) 2008-NOW: Argentina (52, 10) HONOURS: . Benfica: Primeira Liga, League Cup (2) Real Madrid: Champions League, Super Cup, La Liga, Copa del Rey (2), Spanish Super Cup . Argentina: 2014 World Cup runner-up, Olympic Gold Medal . Where else can he play? For every tactical alternative in Van Gaal’s big black folder there is a role that Di Maria can play. The Argentine’s versatility is a one of his greatest qualities. In the 3-5-2 formation he could also play as the left wing-back. He could play wide left in a 4-4-2. He could also play wide right in a 4-4-2 coming inside to shoot with his left foot. He can play on the left or right of a 4-3-3 both in the midfield three and the front three. Jose Mourinho even had him down as an emergency left back. If he’s so good, why are Real Madrid selling? The same reason they sold Arjen Robben in 2009. The insatiable desire for new players must be, in part, financed by sales. Three Champions League finals later no-one can say Bayern were wrong to sign Robben. Catch me if you can: Di Maria is known for his versatility and has even been used by Jose Mourinho at left back . Where would Di Maria sit in the most-expensive football transfers of all time? =1: £86m - Gareth Bale (Tottenham to Real Madrid) =1: £80m - Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United to Real Madrid) =3: £75m - Luis Suarez (Liverpool to Barcelona) =3: £75m - Di Maria (Real Madrid to Manchester United) 5: £71.5m - Neymar (Santos to Barcelona) 6: £63m - James Rodriguez (Monaco to Real Madrid) 7: £59m - Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Inter Milan to Barcelona) 7: £56m - Kaka (AC Milan to Real Madrid) 8: £55m - Edinson Cavani (Napoli to PSG) 9: £51m - Radamel Falcao (Atletico Madrid to Monaco) =10: £50m - Fernando Torres (Liverpool to Chelsea) =10: £50m - David Luiz (Chelsea to PSG) Is the £75m price tag justified? No, and United should not have to end up paying that much. They are the only buyer bidding here. Where will Real Madrid sell him if not to United? Paris Saint-Germain can’t buy him because of financial fair play restrictions. Manchester City turned down the chance to buy him earlier in the summer for the same reason. Real need to sell and United are in a queue of one so they should not be held to ransom. It will be interesting to see if both clubs agree on the price paid. Remember how Real claimed Gareth Bale cost about 90m euros and Tottenham insisted it was 100? The sale of Di Maria is hugely unpopular so Florentino Perez needs to justify it with the highest price possible. Is Di Maria worthy of the United No 7 shirt? Just think about that Xabi Alonso tweet for a moment: ‘Thanks for everything. I wish you all the best, even if you are going to United. We will never forget the zig-zag in extra-time in Lisbon’. Tired legs everywhere and Di Maria as fresh as if it were the 10th minute not the 110th minute, hurtling down the left, darting between full back Juanfran and centre back Miranda, drawing Thibaut Courtois and crossing to Gareth Bale at the back post for him to score the Champions League winning goal. If he produces moments like that for United he will be more than worthy. You can Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page here.

"Until their identities were finally uncovered, Harry and Edna were just a long-dead mystery couple, who had left their colorful legacy behind in a vat of abandoned 60-year old photos. When Chicago-based photographer Jeff Phillips, perusing a thrift store in St. Louis, Missouri, came across 30 boxes, filled with over 1,000 of their photos; he bought them, examined them, and was determined to trace their identities. He posted the captivating photos to Facebook, and an army of social media detectives cracked it: Harry August Grossmann and Edna Annette Lehr were a Missouri couple who married in 1923 and stayed together until their deaths; Harry in 1986 aged 87, and Edna in 1983 aged 82. Mystery: Photographer Jeff Phillips found over 1,000 photo slides of a mystery couple in a thrift store, labeled only 'Harry' (right) and 'Edna' (left) - which documented their lives through the 1950s . Social media shout out:  Mr Phillips posted the images to this Facebook page (pictured) in the hopes that perhaps their children would recognize it. In the end,  an unconnected woman  traced them using various clues . It is unclear why no-one claimed Harry and Edna's extensive collection of photos after they died, or how they ended up in a thrift store. But the images tell the story of an adventurous couple very much in love, who traveled the world, attended fine parties and had many friends. It later transpired that they bore no children and stayed together for the rest of their lives. When Mr Phillips first stumbled across the photos, he was transfixed. They were in Kodachrome slide format - a process which was phased out in the 1970s - with scribbled clues accompanying them. Some dated back to the 1940s, but most of them to the 1950s. Solved: Globetrotters Harry August Grossmann and Edna Annette Lehr (pictured in Alaska in 1958) were a Missouri couple who married in 1923 and were together until their deaths . Whatever the weather: The couple's identity was traced by Jennifer Edinger from Seattle, Washington, who studied the locations that featured, among other clues. Pictured, Edna in a snap  simply labeled 'boat' Touching: Harry (left) and Edna (right) appear to have enjoyed a long and happy marriage, Harry dying in 1986 aged 87 and Edna in 1983 aged 82. Pictured, an unlabeled snap of their 35th wedding anniversary . Mr Phillips posted the images to a Facebook page he created called Is This Your Mother? - assuming that perhaps the couple had children and grandchildren who might recognize their faces. After scouring clues - everything from the couple's clothing and car license plates to road signs and landmarks in the background of their photos - the mystery was solved. A swift three weeks after Mr Phillips had first enlisted social media to help with his search, a woman named Jennifer Edinger from Seattle, Washington sent him the following email: . 'Harry August Grossmann and Edna Annette Lehr. Edna died in 1983. Harry passed away three years later.' Pigeon party: It later transpired that the couple never had children, but do have living great nieces and nephews. Pictured, Harry larking around on one of their many adventures . Fun: The heartwarming photos Harry and Edna left behind were in Kodachrome slide format, a photography process which was phased out in the 1970s. Pictured, Edna in St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy . Very matching: Harry took a number of pictures at the couple's home in the affluent village of Frontenac, St Louis, including this one of Edna, dated October 1952 . Mellow yellow: Clearly Harry had a penchant for documenting his wife's colorful array of outfits. Pictured, Edna, undated . Ms Edinger, a stranger to Mr Phillips with a hobby for tracing lineage, had pulled the conclusion together from a frenzied bout of detective work, based on various clues from the photos. Following this, Mr Phillips tracked down several of Harry and Edna's extended family members; all of whom were very intrigued and supportive of his project, including a great niece called Maria. Maria sent an email to Mr Phillips, which reads: 'You have gone to great lengths to find our family and it is heartwarming and a little creepy (in a fun way) to see how interested others are in my Great Aunt and Uncle.' A peek into the past: Harry reclines on the deck of a cruise ship, looking very cheerful indeed . Nautical nonsense: Edna (left) sporting a very jolly hat as she grins for a photo, while an extremely relaxed fellow sunbather (right) soaks up the rays close-by . So many vacations: Edna (pictured on a mystery boat) worked as a bookkeeper for a sheet metal company and both she and Harry, who worked in the same industry, reportedly did well for themselves . Nice gear: From what we can tell, it appears that Harry (pictured) had a willing nature and a good sense of humor . It has since been discovered that Harry was in the sheet metal business. He listed himself as an 'employer' on his 1940 census. Edna was a bookkeeper, also in the sheet metal industry. They were both successful in their careers according to Mr Phillips, and for many years lived in the affluent village of Frontenac, St Louis, in Missouri, where a lot of the photos were taken. Three years after he first found the photos, Mr Phillips curated a photography show made up from Harry and Edna's photos entitled Lost and Found, which just ended at the Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, in Chicago. Snow dome: Mr Phillips found this unmarked photo of the couple (pictured) in a box titled 'Alaska' Why not a reindeer? Edna visits Santa's grotto during one of the couple's numerous trips to Alaska, upstaged in this case by a rogue goat . Changing landscapes: Edna commemorates a trip to Cyprus Gardens, a botanical garden and theme park near Winter Haven, Florida, which closed down in 2009 and has now been incorporated into Legoland Florida . Buddies: This snap of some fellow-vacationers at the El Rancho Hotel in Haiti (top) was dated 1961, making it one of the most recent images discovered. Mr Phillips has zoomed in on some of the faces (bottom) Harry and Edna may be long gone, but Mr Phillips' project triggered some interesting observations about the nature of our world here and now. 'Harry's slides from the 1950s were nearly lost forever,' he tells MailOnline. 'When slide film as a format became obsolete, the slides were discarded because no one had a projector to view them with.' He adds: 'I'm asking viewers to consider whether our digital preservation habits will prevent history from repeating itself.' Indeed, now that our own photo histories are largely captured, shared, and stored not in print, or even on discs, but on gigantic social media servers, could they ever really be 'lost?' Party hats: An advertisement from 1958 (left) for the Matson cruise ship, on which Harry and Edna (front left) appear to be having a whale of a time . A feast for the eyes: This floral-themed image of Edna (left) and Harry (right) was labeled '25th Anniversary,' and was dated 1948 . Candid moment: Edna, looking older than in many of the other photos, puts her feet up in the cabin of an unidentified vessel . Close: 'Harry's slides were nearly lost forever,' Mr Philiips says. 'When slide film became obsolete, the slides were discarded because no one had a projector to view them with.' Pictured, Painted Desert, Arizona 1955 . Mr Phillips' project also prompted him to question why so many strangers flocked to the Facebook page, and put so much genuine effort into uncloaking Harry and Edna's identities. 'It seemed as though they wanted to ensure that the couple's memories were preserved,' he remarks. 'I suspect that the interest in this story reflects on worries about our own mortality: when the last photograph of us is discarded, is that when we're truly forgotten?' One Facebook user commented on a photo of Edna: 'I have no children, and I have often wondered if anyone will ever care that I was on planet earth. I can relate to Edna.' Crossroads: Mr Phillips asks viewers to consider whether or not our digital preservation habits will prevent our own photos getting lost forever, as Harry and Edna's almost were. Pictured, Edna, undated . Where is he off to? According to Mr Phillips, there are 'hundreds' of mystery portraits of Harry (pictured) posing next to structures similar to this . Partners for life: After this shot was taken, in Maui, Hawaii, it is likely that Harry sat down next to his wife in their matching wicker seats and simply watched the world go by . One heck of a party: Nothing is known about this undated photo, but it does imply that Harry and Edna (not pictured) had a healthy social life . Life's a beach: This is one of the few shots that could almost be mistaken for a modern day Instagram snap . Strangers: This photo of an unknown couple was found in a box labeled 'miscellaneous,' the slide damaged by liquid and mold . Ladies man: Harry (center) poses with four cheery looking ladies as they all clutch ice cream cones . A clue! Edna and the couple's rental car at the El Tovar Hotel near the Grand Canyon, Arizona in 1957, which still stands remarkably unchanged to this day. Details like this were useful for social media detectives . Farewell: Mr Phillips suspects that the reason so many people were desperate to identify Harry and Edna, was a fear of their own mortality, and of one day being lost from history themselves .

"It has laid largely unstudied in a university library for more than 100 years. But now a 1,500-year-old papyrus has been identified as one of the world’s earliest surviving Christian charms. The ‘remarkable’ document contains some of the earliest documented references to The Last Supper and sheds new light on early Christian practices, experts say. A magical find: A 1,500-year-old papyrus has been identified as one of the world’s earliest surviving Christian charms (pictured) and experts believe it sheds light on early Christian practices . The document was rediscovered in the University of Manchester’s John Rylands Library. It is the earliest surviving document to use the Christian Eucharist liturgy - which describes The Last Supper - as a protective charm. The ‘magical’ words are written on a recycled piece of papyrus, which was originally used as a grain tax receipt. Dr Roberta Mazza, a Research Fellow of the John Rylands Research Institute, came across the Greek ‘amulet’ while trawling through thousands of fragments of unpublished historical documents that are kept inside the library’s vaults. The charm is written on a recycled piece of papyrus, which was originally used as a grain tax receipt (pictured). Dr Mazza used spectral imaging techniques to reveal that the charm was written on used material . The full text of the papyrus reads: . 'Fear you all who rule over the earth. 'Know you nations and peoples that Christ is our God. 'For he spoke and they came to being, he commanded and they were created; he put everything under our feet and delivered us from the wish of our enemies. 'Our God prepared a sacred table in the desert for the people and gave manna of the new covenant to eat, the Lord’s immortal body and the blood of Christ poured for us in remission of sins.' She believes that the charm casts important new light on early Christianity - just 300 years after the Roman emperor Constantine converted to the religion. It shows how Christians adopted the ancient Egyptian practice of wearing amulets to protect the wearer against dangers. This practice of writing charms on pieces of papyrus was continued by the Christians who replaced the prayers to Egyptian and Greco-Roman gods with extracts from the Bible. Dr Mazza used spectral imaging techniques to reveal that the charm was written on recycled papyrus. Faint lettering on the back of the charm is thought to be a receipt for the payment of grain tax which was certified by a tax collector from the village of Tertembuthis, outside the ancient city of Hermopolis, in modern el-Ashmunein. Dr Mazza explained: ‘The amulet maker would have cut a piece of the receipt, written the charm on the other side and then he would have folded the papyrus to be kept in a locket or pendant. It is for this reason the tax receipt on the exterior was damaged and faded away.’ The document had been held at the library since 1901, but no-one had realised its significance. Faint lettering on the back of the charm is thought to be a receipt for the payment of grain tax which was certified by a tax collector from the village of Tertembuthis, outside the ancient city of Hermopolis, in modern el-Ashmunein, marked on the map at 'A' A fresh look at Christian practices: The ‘remarkable’ document contains some of the earliest documented references to The Last Supper and sheds new light on early Christian practices, experts say. An image of Leonardo da Vinci's famous mural is pictured . The papyrus contains some of the earliest documented references to The Last Supper. It is also one of the first recorded documents to use magic in the Christian context. It would have been folded up inside a locket or pendant, worn by someone in the hope it protected them. It shows how Christians adopted the ancient Egyptian practice of wearing amulets to protect the wearer against dangers. This practice of writing charms on pieces of papyrus was continued by the Christians who replaced the prayers to Egyptian and Greco-Roman gods with extracts from the Bible. The papyrus also shows the extent to which Christianity had spread in Egypt 1,500 years ago. The charm would have been worn by an ordinary person - probably not a priest. Some Christians still use passages from the Bible as protective charms, so the amulet marks the beginning of a trend in Christianity. Dr Mazza said: ‘This is an important and unexpected discovery as it’s one of the first recorded documents to use magic in the Christian context and the first charm ever found to refer to the Eucharist - the last supper - as the manna of the Old Testament. The text of the amulet is a combination of biblical passages including Psalm 78:23-24 and Matthew 26:28-30 among others. It includes the words: ‘Our God prepared a sacred table in the desert for the people and gave manna of the new covenant to eat, the Lord’s immortal body and the blood of Christ poured for us in remission of sins.’ Dr Mazza said that some Christians still use passages from the Bible as protective charms, so the amulet marks the beginning of a trend in Christianity. ‘Though we know almost nothing about the owner of the charm, we think it could have been owned by a resident of the village nearby Hermopolis (el-Ashmunein),’ she said. ‘We can say this is an incredibly rare example of Christianity and the Bible becoming meaningful to ordinary people - not just priests and the elite. ‘It’s doubly fascinating because the amulet maker clearly knew the Bible, but made lots of mistakes: some words are misspelled and others are in the wrong order. This suggests that he was writing by heart rather than copying it. ‘It’s quite exciting. Thanks to this discovery, we now think that the knowledge of the Bible was more embedded in sixth century AD Egypt than we previously realised.’","1,500-year-old papyrus is one of the  earliest surviving Christian charms .

"This is the extraordinary moment a family of meerkats pulled together to save their newborn pups from a deadly snake. The drama unfolded when a venomous puff adder invaded a burrow where five newborn meerkats pups were sleeping. The meerkats, which are renown for living in tight-knit family groups, were forced to rally round and drag the babies from the burrow out of danger, but not before one female was bitten by the deadly snake. Sss-sensational: A family of meerkats in South Africa pulled together to save their newborn pups from a deadly snake . The meerkats, which are renown for living in tight-knit family groups, were forced to rally round and drag the babies from the burrow out of danger . Despite a serious injury to her leg the female continued to help and eventually carried all five pups to safety. Photographer Robin Hoskyns from Leicester captured the commotion on camera. Mr Hoskyns was working as a research assistant at the Kalahari Meerkat Project in South Africa at the time and said the event summed up the strength and determination of meerkats. Robin said: 'Meerkat pups stay underground and don't emerge for up to three weeks until their eyes have opened and they are able to react to their environment a little. Teamwork: The whole meerkat family helped save the tiny pups . Adorable: The meerkat pups look dazed after being dragged away from the snake . Deadly: The puff adder lurks in the meerkat's burrow . 'During this time the group generally leave up to three individuals to babysit at the burrow. 'On this particular morning I arrived at the burrow and sat down to wait, and waited, and waited. 'About three hours after the usual time for this group to be up, the sunrise had long gone and it was starting to get hot when I heard noises coming from the burrow. 'Suddenly the group emerged. Usually a group gets up casually one by one and they sit about at the entrance for a while to warm up before leaving but this time was different. 'It was a frenzy of meerkats coming up from different holes and popping back down again. After about 10 minutes of this activity I spotted a slightly purplish lump in the middle of the frenzy. Brave: Despite having suffered a snake bite, the dominant female carries the babies to safety . Remarkable sight: The drama was watched by photographer Robin Hoskyns from Leicester . Rescued: The pups were transported to another burrow about 300 metres away . 'At first I thought it was dead but I saw it try to raise its head. In the next 20 minutes they brought up two more pups and then another two, so five in total. 'The action was frantic but luckily I had my camera so I was snapping away trying to capture what was going on. 'At some point I noticed the dominant females leg was badly swollen and bleeding. Due to the swelling I predicted that it was a snake bite and sure enough when I managed to get a glimpse down the burrow I saw the head of a rather angry puff adder. 'The group at that time had four juveniles which were almost sub-adults who were all obviously very excited by everything that was going on and kept trying to pick up the pups which they could only just lift, moving them a couple of metres and running back to the burrow. 'This carried on for quite some time. Eventually the dominant female picked up one of the pups and made for the next nearest burrow, probably about 300 metres away. 'She eventually managed to carry all five pups to the next burrow almost by herself with a now massively swollen front leg. All the pups survived their ordeal and so did the dominant female. 'Looking back, it was up there with the top wildlife experiences I had in the past year as a meerkat research assistant. 'It was amazing to witness the strength and determination of that dominant female and I'm glad I took my camera out that day.'","A venomous puff adder invaded a meerkat burrow in South Africa .

"Floyd Mayweather Jr’s former fiancee has filed a lawsuit against the boxing champion accusing him of beating her and later publicly humiliating her by posting online a sonogram of her pregnancy and claiming they broke up because she got an abortion. Shantel Jackson said Mayweather also threatened to post naked photos of her on social media if she didn't take down a picture she posted of herself with rapper Nelly at a basketball game in April.

Emotional roller coaster: Jackson, 29, has accused Mayweather of battery, assault, invasion of privacy, defamation and false imprisonment . 'Battered woman': Jackson claims her ex-fiance twisted her arm, choked her and threatened her with a gun . Adding insult to injury: The 29-year-old said Mayweather publicly humiliated her by posting online her pregnancy sonogram and saying she had aborted their twins . She said she finally left Mayweather after concluding he was abusive and would not change. Allred did not specify damages in the civil suit against Mayweather, the undefeated boxing superstar whom Forbes described as the highest paid athlete in the world last year, with earnings of $105million. She declined to say whether Jackson actually got an abortion when pregnant with twins by Mayweather, but said Jackson told Mayweather in January that the pregnancy was terminated. The lawsuit was filed Thursday in Superior Court in Los Angeles nine days before Mayweather returns to the ring September 13 in Las Vegas in a rematch against Marcos Maidana. Floyd Mayweather served two months in jail in 2012 after pleading guilty to reduced domestic battery charges stemming from a hair-pulling, arm-twisting attack on his former girlfriend, Josie Harris, while two of their three children watched. Through thick and thin: Jackson stuck with Mayweather during his previous domestic violence case involving his ex-girlfriend that landed him in jail for two months . Love story: Jackson and Mayweather met in 2006 when then-21-year-old former model was working as a hostess . Shantel Jackson, a former model and actress, met Mayweather in 2006 when she worked as a hostess in Atlanta, and they later began dating and were engaged, Gloria Allred told a news conference in Los Angeles. Jackson stood by him through the domestic violence case and visited him in jail. Then after he was released in August 2012, he physically assaulted her, Allred said. He allegedly twisted he woman’s arm, choked her and snatched her phone so he could look through its contents. During the on-again off-again relationship that followed, Mayweather sent a private jet to bring Jackson from Los Angeles, where she lived, to join him in Las Vegas and showered her with Hermes handbags, the attorney said. Bad timing: The lawsuit comes just nine days before Mayweather, seen here working out Tuesday, returns to the ring September 13 in Las Vegas in a rematch against Marcos Maidana . Multimillionaire: Forbes described Mayweather the highest paid athlete in the world last year, with earnings of $105million . The lawsuit alleges that in April 2013, the 37-year-old star athlete assaulted his fiancée once again, 'bent her arm, restrained her, and pointed a gun at her foot asking ""Which toe do you want me to shoot?""' The husband-to-be then allegedly demanded that Jackson take off her 17-carat engagement ring at gunpoint. At one point, when Jackson was in Los Angeles and refused to move to Las Vegas, Mayweather wrote on Facebook and Instagram that they broke up because she had an abortion and he was ‘totally against killing babies,’ and he posted a sonogram of the twin fetuses he fathered, according to the complaint. ‘I have been embarrassed and humiliated more than I can ever imagine by Floyd, whom I once called my best friend and fiance,’ Jackson tearfuly told reporters. The lawsuit also accused Mayweather of arranging to have over $1million worth of Jackson's property taken from a storage unit where she put such items as bags and shoes.","Shantel Jackson, 29, filed civil lawsuit against 37-year-old athlete in Los Angeles .

"The al Qaida-linked Islamist extremist cell behind an earlier political assassination also killed a leftist Tunisian politician using the same weapon, a top security official said today. Mohammed Brahmi was shot 14 times in front of his home within sight of his family yesterday, plunging the country into a political crisis and unleashing demonstrations around the country blaming the government for the assassination. Interior Minister Loutfi Ben Jeddou told reporters that ballistics tests on the 9mm bullets used in the attack showed it came from the same weapon used to kill opposition leader Chokri Belaid in February. He alleged that the gunman is Boubakr Hakim, a 30-year-old weapons smuggler born in France, who, he said, was known for jihadi sympathies. Murdered: Mohamed Brahmi, pictured left, was shot 14 times outside of his home within sight of his family yesterday - six months after opposition leader Chokri Belaid, pictured right, was shot dead in February . Linked: Tunisian Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou today revealed Mohamed Brahmi was killed with the same gun that was used to kill his party leader Chokri Belaid six months ago . Mr Ben Jeddou said they have reached that conclusion based on physical evidence and eyewitness testimonies. Hakim had already been implicated as part of the 14-person cell behind Belaid's assassination by four members of the al Qaida-linked group detained during that investigation. The weapon used in both attacks was a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. Police recently searched Hakim's home and found another handgun, explosives and 90 rounds of ammunition. The press conference came after demonstrations raged around the country the night before, holding the ruling Islamist Ennahda Party responsible for the assassination and attacking local party headquarters. Police used tear gas in central Tunis and in the provinces to disperse the protests. Suspect: It has been alleged that Salafist extremist, Boubaker Hakim, pictured, is responsible for Brahmi's killing yesterday . The killing of Brahmi of the leftist Popular Current party raised fears of new chaos in the country that unleashed the Arab Spring. Tunisia is working toward enshrining a new constitution meant to lead the way to lasting democracy and so far has avoided the widespread violence and unrest as in Egypt and Libya. Brahmi was a respected leftist politician and a strong critic of the Ennahda Party, which rules in a coalition with two other secular parties. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for his killing. His party said it is postponing his funeral, initially planned for today, fearing it could inflame supporters on an already tense day. He will be buried tomorrow in the same cemetery in Tunis as Belaid. The main trade union called for a general strike today, closing down the airport, public transport and most government offices as a new coalition of civil society and opposition parties called for the dissolution of the government and the national assembly. In a statement published by Mosaique FM, several left wing and liberal parties announced the formation of a National Salvation Front calling for civil disobedience and a sit-in outside the national assembly until it, and the government, are dissolved. There have also been reports of resignations by some members of the assembly, which was elected in October 2011 and charged with writing a new constitution and running the country. The constitution was expected to be completed and new elections held by the end of the year. The new opposition front is calling for the formation of a national unity government charged with finishing the constitution and holding new elections. Investigation: Forensic inspectors examine Tunisian opposition politician Mohamed Brahmi's car after he was shot dead outside his home in Tunis yesterday . In mourning: Family members of assassinated Tunisian opposition politician Mohamed Brahmi mourn in Tunis yesterday . Widow: Mbarka Brahmi cries after she was informed that her husband, Mohammed Brahmi, died from his wounds at Mahmoud Materi Hospital, north of Tunis, after being shot outside his home . In a statement, Ennahda condemned the assassination as a 'cowardly' act 'targeting the revolution and national unity, and obstructing the democratic transition process'. Much of the opposition, however, is holding Ennahda responsible for Brahmi's assassination, much as it did Belaid's, either because the Islamists have been unable to ensure security in the country or because they are actively collaborating with extremist elements to target their opponents. The Interior Ministry has accused Islamist extremists of being behind the attack on Belaid and said it would announce the names of suspects shortly. The US State Department, the United Nations and Amnesty International called for an impartial investigation into the killings and for Tunisians to avoid reacting with violence.

"You may think you can outsmart the road authorities, but soon it won’t just be their speed cameras keeping an eye on your driving. General Motors is set to become the first car manufacturer to install eye-tracking technology in its vehicles, according to a recent report. The feature will allow cars to track drivers’ eye movements to ensure they keep their attention on the road. General Motors is set to become the first car manufacturer to install eye-tracking technology in its vehicles. The feature will allow cars to track drivers’ eye movements to make sure they keep attention on the road . GM will install around half a million cars with eye-tracking devices over the next three to five years, according to unnamed sources speaking to the Financial Times. The Detroit car manufacturer is using technology made by Seeing Machines, a Canberra-based company who specialises in driver fatigue technology. Cameras fitted in the cars will be backed by algorithms that can identify features of drivers' faces. The technology will then impose this information on a three-dimensional map of the interior of the car to determine what the driver is looking at. It will also be able to measure the rotation of the head so they can alert drivers if they are not spending enough time looking in areas such as the rear-view mirror. GM will install around half a million cars with eye-tracking devices over the next three to five years.  The Detroit car manufacturer is using technology made by Seeing Machines, a Canberra-based company . According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one of every ten fatal crashes in the US involves distraction. Meanwhile, statistics provided by the RAC reveal that 20 per cent of Australian drivers involved in crashes admit they were staring at the object they ended up hitting, because they were distracted. As well as safety, the technology could allow drivers to communicate with their cars, without having to press a button or turn the wheel. However, it could raise privacy issues over how manufacturers and insurers deal with the data. Seeing Machines' devices said, initially, it will not keep the information it records. GM has been contacted for comment by MailOnline, but has yet to respond. While GM may be monitoring eye movements, a new car hopes to solve the problem of driver distraction by using a brain waves to start the engine and keep it going. The concept, developed by the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia and Emotiv, is currently being tested in a Honda i40. The Attention Powered Car features a neuro headset that connects brain activity to the car’s engine through customised software. The headset has 14 sensors detecting electrical activity from the frontal, temple, parietal and perceptual areas of the brain. The amount of activity in these areas registers what the driver is processing, or if they are zoning out. When the driver is distracted, the software sends a cut-off signal to the car and the accelerator switches to idle safely slowing the car down.","Detroit car manufacturer is using technology made by Seeing Machines .

"At White Hart Lane on Sunday, Brendan Rodgers gave a fascinating insight into his motivation to lead Liverpool to the top. He had just been asked about his quip - ‘the run was Ricky Villa and the finish was Ricky Gervais’ - after Raheem Sterling scuffed a chance to make it 4-0 at Tottenham. ‘A few of you thought I was David Brent when I got the job and I haven’t forgotten that either,’ he remarked. Scroll down for video . A good day at the office: Brendan Rodgers applauds during Liverpool's 3-0 victory at Tottenham . Bad day at The Office: David Brent doing his famous dance during the TV programme . In his temporary office at White Hart Lane, there was suddenly a bit of a chill. His mood changed instantly, though, when he was asked about the flexibility and tactical awareness of this Liverpool team. His enthusiasm for the development of young players in his side is infectious. That is his passion, committing himself to improving the players he has on the training ground each day at Liverpool. If only there were more like this in the game. These are the skills Rodgers acquired when he was a young coach, first at Reading and then at Chelsea. Although he accepts that there is pressure to compete for a place in the top four again, particularly after last season’s title challenge, he also wants to improve and nurture his players. There was genuine care in his voice, almost pastoral, when he was asked about Sterling’s performance and his preferred position on the field on Sunday. This is what Rodgers said: ‘I think he's flexible. We've tried to develop him not only to be a wide player but to have the freedom and the awareness to play on the inside. ‘It was perfect for him today: he can turn, press, work, and in a 4-3-3 he can work on the side and penetrate. It's important he has the intelligence to play these different positions.’ This has echoes of the Dutch school of thought, with its origins in the philosophy of the great coach Rinus Michels. Everybody has to be comfortable on the ball, to be flexible on the field and learn to play in different positions. Ruud Gullit, one of the game’s most distinguished and decorated players, played up front, in the centre of midfield and as a sweeper during his career. He looked at home in all three. Dennis Bergkamp, whose instructive autobiography Stillness and Speed is a motivational tool for young players, played out on the wing for Ajax before he became one of the world’s most accomplished No 10s. For English football and its players to flourish again, the Barclays Premier League will need more coaches with Rodgers’ feeling for the game. Sterling work: Rodgers has developed Liverpool's wonderkid Raheem Sterling . Scoring touch: Sterling steers the ball in for Liverpool's first goal at White Hart lane on Sunday . Liverpool’s manager has no obligation to England, but he started with four internationals - captain Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Sterling, at White Hart Lane. Not a huge number, but more than his rivals. Arsenal, who played at Leicester on Sunday, fielded none in their starting XI. With the exception of Gerrard, who retired from international football after the World Cup, the other three are in the England team for Wednesday evening’s friendly with Norway. To many, the tactical expressions are a turn-off in a game that can be over-complicated at times by managers theorising about systems and formations. Thumbs up: Rodgers is always trying to make his Liverpool players better, no matter what their age . The Rodgers Effect: Jordan Henderson (left) has really developed under the guidance of his Liverpool boss . But Rodgers tests his players, pushing their minds that little bit more and asking them to stretch the limits. Sterling is the latest example. You sure you're not Brent?! Rodgers strikes a pose reminiscent of the Brent picture further up . ‘He needs to be better on his left foot,’ was Rodgers’ considered analysis after he missed the chance to score a second goal against Spurs. He meant it. ‘His tactical awareness is improving and for a kid of 19... he's going to be great. Him, Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson are going to do well for Roy Hodgson in the years to come. They've shown they can play in different positions.’ Sterling himself admitted, after the impressive win over Tottenham, that he has been asked to play and learn a number of positions across Liverpool’s forward line. How many managers, under almost intolerable pressure to win every match and not make mistakes, are prepared to risk that? Not many. It wasn’t that long ago, when Rodgers was mocked for his part in Being: Liverpool, that Sterling was getting it in the neck from the Liverpool manager. At the time, Rodgers told the Liverpool forward that he would be on the first plane back to England from their US tour in 2012 after he made a disrespectful comment to his manager. Others in this Liverpool team are maturing, too. When Henderson spoke on Monday at England’s training base, he was passionate about the future of the national team. He spoke about the Rodgers Effect, the doctrines and principles the Liverpool manager has impressed upon this group of players. Henderson is captaincy material for club and country, a fine example of a young player increasing in influence on and off the field. In time, it will all be there for him. Henderson’s personality has been teased out of him, partially down to his improved performances on the pitch alongside his captain. Back in the training ground office at Melwood, Rodgers has played his part in that. VIDEO How to manage Mario Balotelli, with Brendan Rodgers .","Brendan Rodgers was once compared to David Brent .

"Xabi Alonso said goodbye to Real Madrid on Friday and admitted he turned his back on a possible return to the Premier League because he did not want to spoil his Liverpool legacy. The former Spain midfielder, who joins Bayern Munich from Real Madrid after five years at the club, has been linked with a return to England with former coach Jose Mourinho in the past and even to former rivals Manchester United this summer. But speaking from the Bernabeu he said: 'I had five great years at Liverpool and I would rather just keep that memory as it is.

'At the end of last season I knew that winning the Champions League would usher in a new era for the club and I need to start a new era too. 'I detected that this might be the moment when it was right to leave. 'We fought hard to win the club's tenth European Cup after losing three semi-finals, it was a weight lifted and a good time to move on.' Some Madrid fans say they feel betrayed by his decision to join such a big European rival and one that is coached by former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola. But when asked about his part in some of the more fiery Clasicos against Guardiola's Barca, Alonso said: 'What happens on the pitch you leave on the pitch. 'This is a decision about football nothing else. And I think Madrid are well covered in midfield.' Many believe playing under Guardiola will be a stepping stone to a management for Alonso, who is coming at the end of a playing career in which he has already worked with most of Europe's finest coaches. He said: 'I'm going to learn a lot. I've been lucky to have had some great coaches. My dad was a coach too. I will learn at Bayern and that is an extra motivation for going. I've learned from Carlo [Ancelotti], [Jose] Mourinho, [Manuel] Pellegrini and now I'm sure I will learn more. I have spoken to Pep and he has told me what he wants from me.' Memories: Alonso, who spent five years at Liverpool, said he turned down Premier League clubs . Learning curve: Touted as a future manager, Alonso looks forward to working with Pep Guardiola . New team-mates: Alonso could line up alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger in the heart of Bayern's midfield . Xabi Alonso is the latest Spanish player to join Bayern's ranks since Pep Guardiola took over as manager. Javi Martinez was already at the club before Guardiola took over, but he has since brought in Thiago Alcantara, Juan Bernat, Pepe Reina and now Alonso. Guardiola has also surrounded himself with Spanish staff, such as aide Manel Estiarte, assistant coach Domenec Torrent, fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura and match analyst Carles Planchart. Real Madrid confirmed Alonso's move via an official club statement: 'Real Madrid CF and Bayern Munich have reached an agreement for the transfer of the player Xabi Alonso. 'The player will appear before the media on Friday at 11:00pm in the press room at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, accompanied by the Director of Institutional Relations Club , Emilio Butragueno.'

Reddit users then tracked back through Hamade's previous posts and matched the hard drive and the PC name. They then used this information to track down the Southern Digital Media website, which listed Bryan's name and occupation. Bryan said: ‘4chan thinks it's me for because of the photoshopped post I made. I am not a hacker. I have no idea how the hell someone could hack into all those accounts.’ Mr Hamade said he had been caught up in an internet ‘witch hunt’ to find the culprit. He added: 'I am just an idiot . who tried to pull one over on 4chan and lost big time. 'I am not the . original leaker.

The original photos were reportedly stolen via iCloud, before being published on file-sharing website 4chan . 'I'd never in a million years know how to hack into any of the accounts listed. 4chan just attacked me because they like to attack anyone in situations such as this.’ Hamade added that in an attempt to prove his innocence, he is now hunting for the real hacker. 'The real guy is on 4chan posting intermittently,' Hamade said. 'He’s most likely the one behind it, but it does seem the photos passed around to multiple people before being leaked, so it may just be someone who has them and didn’t hack to get them.'

"An 80-year-old man could be prosecuted after he shot a robber dead even though she was fleeing his house and saying she was pregnant. Homeowner Tom Greer took direct action with a .22-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver on Tuesday night after he was 'jumped on' by two intruders at his home in Long Beach, California. When he drew his gun the unarmed man the woman both ran away, but the woman could not flee fast enough and was shot twice in the back. Force: His arm in a sling, 80-year-old Tom Greer told NBC Los Angeles: 'They downed me, they jumped on me in the hallway... She says ""don't shoot me, I'm pregnant, I'm gonna have a baby"" and I shot her anyway' Now Mr Greer is being investigated after he gave a vivid account to a journalist - which suggested the woman was down an alleyway when she was shot. His arm in a sling, he told NBC Los Angeles: 'I walked in on them and they downed me, they jumped on me in the hallway. 'The lady didn't run as fast as the man so I shot her in the back twice. She's dead.. but he got away. She says ""don't shoot me, I'm pregnant, I'm gonna have a baby"" and I shot her anyway. 'I shot her so that's going to leave a message on his mind for the rest of his life.' According to the station, he then said: 'She was dead. I shot her twice, she best be dead... (The man) had run off and left her.' Upmarket: The shooting happened at his home (pictured) in the Bixby Knolls neighbourhood. Mr Greer's remarks to local news station NBC Los Angeles could land him in hot water with Long Beach's police . The Long Beach Police Department is investigating the incident, which took place in the upmarket neighbourhood of Bixby Knolls. Officers have not revealed whether the woman - who remains unnamed - was shot in the immediate surroundings of Mr Greer's home or down an alleyway as she escaped. The distinction could make all the difference as to whether Mr Greer is prosecuted for taking self-defense too far. California's self-defense laws allow homeowners to use force to protect themselves, other people or their property. But the force must be no more than is reasonably necessary and it must defend against immediate danger - solving a possible threat in the future is not enough. Fatal: The investigation could hinge on whether or not the woman was shot down this alleyway as she fled . In January police in Orlando, Florida, charged a 32-year-old man with second degree murder after he chased and shot a man he claimed was trying to burgle his apartment. Officers arrested Claudius Smith after finding 21-year-old Ricardo Sanes lying dead on the grass surrounded by six shell casings. Mr Greer's neighbour George Romero told CBS Los Angeles burglars had struck at the pensioner's home before. 'I remember the first break-in,' he said. 'They literally tore down the front door.' It is believed the male accomplice is still on the run. Long Beach Police could not be reached for further comment.","Tom Greer took direct action with a .22-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver .

"A British Army sergeant major punched a married soldier three times after finding one of his female gunners in his bed and taking 15 photos to document the evidence, a court heard. Warrant Officer 2 Martin Holder intervened after allegedly finding Lance Bombardier Sarah White under the covers of Colour Sergeant James Kelt's bunk following an alcohol-fuelled night out during a training exercise in Germany. The 50-year-old immediately started taking photos of the pair, which he claimed he would use as evidence to prove they had 'breached' the standards and values of the army. Sergeant Major Martin Holder, 50 (left) punched Colour Sergeant James Kelt (right) three times after finding him in bed with another soldier during an overseas exercise in Germany . The court heard Lance Bombadier White worked in WO2 Holder's store room and he believed the situation with a superior - who was three ranks above her - brought the force into disrepute. The three were all based at the prestigious Sandhurst Royal Military Academy in Camberley, Surrey, when the incident unfolded, the court was told. In one of the photos shown to the court, Colour Sergeant Kelt, of 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (2 Scots), can be seen holding the green duvet over his head. Another picture shows Lance Bombardier White curled on the bed in the foetal position, shielding her face. Bulford Military Court in Wiltshire heard how Colour Sergeant Kelt, 33, 'jumped from the bed' and began heading towards Sergeant Major Holder, who he told the court punched him three times. After the incident, WO2 Holder was charged with assault. But he walked free from court today after the judge directed the court martial panel to find him not guilty. WO2 Holder had always claimed he acted in self defence after Colour Sergeant Kelt allegedly came towards him 'aggressively'. Colour Sergeant Kelt admitted it was him and Lance Bombardier White who had been captured in the photos, but he denied that they ever got under the covers together. The court heard how the soldiers were in Hohenfels Camp, Germany, in November last year when the drama unfolded. They were at the end of their last exercise with Sandhurst and had gone out to celebrate at a bar on the U.S side of the barracks. In one of the photos shown to the court - taken by WO2 Holder to use as 'evidence' - Colour Sergeant Kelt can be seen holding the duvet over his head, in a bid to stop the photos being taken . Another picture shows Lance Bombardier Sarah White - who was under the command of WO2 Holder - curled on the bed in the foetal position, shielding her face . At around 12.30am on November 24, WO2 Holder, Col Sgt Kelt and L/Bdr White returned to their accommodation. After WO2 Holder went to bed, Col Sgt Kelt and L/Bdr White had a cigarette together before White entered the male block and got into a bed in the dark room. Col Sgt Kelt joined her shortly after, the court heard. On recognising the voices, WO2 Holder - who has since retired from the army after 30 years' service - rose from his bed to confront the pair and discipline his employee. He later claimed he took the pictures as evidence of their 'breach of values and standards' of the army. Opening the case, Captain James Norman told the court: 'The prosecution say that the defendant assaulted Kelt by punching him three times in the face and that by doing so he caused a wound to his face in the small hours. 'Holder and the complainant were both on the directing staff at RMAS. Shortly after having arrived back at the camp Kelt and White ended up together in the male accommodation. 'A short time afterwards, Holder got out of his bed and left the room. He returned a few moments later, turned on the light and took photos of Col Sgt Kelt and Bdr White. 'The complainant jumped from the bed and confronted Holder, who then punched him three times in the face and as a result the complainant suffered cuts to his upper right lip which required sutures. 'He felt that what he saw was a breach of service as both soldiers were married. He said that his intention had been to take photos of them as evidence of them.' When the brawl erupted, other men sleeping in the 60-space accommodation room were forced to intervene, the court heard. Staff Sergeant Ian Ruffle told the court he had seen L/Bdr White on her back on Col Sgt Kelt's bed. 'L/Bdr White was clearly lying on the bed, she was on her back and awake, Col Sgt Kelt was at the bottom of the bed,' he told the court. 'After the few punches were thrown she got quite verbal towards WO2 Holder. She was definitely awake and lying on her back.' Giving evidence in court, Colour Sergeant Kelt admitted it was his hand in the photographs and that the woman pictured was L/Bdr White. But Col Sgt Kelt maintains he remained sat on the bed next to the woman having a conversation and did not at any point get under the covers with her. He told the court he had changed into his nightwear after returning to the dorm from the bowling alley, where he had downed six or seven bottles of Budweiser. He said got out of bed when the lights went on and asked Holder, who was holding a grey wind-up camera in his hand, what he was doing, when he was punched in the face. The three were all based at the country's prestigious military institution, the Sandhurst Royal Military Academy, in Camberley, Surrey (pictured) He said: 'I didn't come back to the room alone, L/Bdr White was with me but she was sat on the other side of the bed. 'When I got up my immediate response was probably to say something along the lines of ""what are you doing"", and I then walked towards him. 'I think I might have got a bit too close to him and he struck me. He was trying to take my picture and he flung the first punch. 'I was probably angry, I didn't advance towards him in a manner of aggression, I just wanted to put a barrier between L/Bdr White and WO2 Holder. 'It put me back a few steps, I would say it was his full force. He was clearly angry and upset, I could see the anger in his face. 'He was clearly in a state of agitation and rage. At one stage White managed to get past and out of the door, and I grabbed a towel to stem the blood flowing from my face.' He added: 'I was not under the covers, I was sitting at the head of the bed, at no stage do I recall seeing her in that [lying down] position.' An RAF serviceman who was lying awake in his bed after the night out on the American side of the camp said he had been smoking outside with L Bdr White and Col Sgt Kelt before the incident at around 12.30am. He recalled: 'White went inside before we came in and when I went into the room she was lying on top of Kelt's bed.' Judge Advocate Michael Elson instructed the panel of three to draw a conclusion of not guilty after the prosecution made the decision to offer no evidence halfway through the trial. He told them: 'The prosecution have decided to offer no further evidence in this case. It would be wrong for me to allow the case to go any further. 'I must direct you to the only finding appropriate, the one of not guilty.' Sandhurst, in Camberley, Surrey, is where all army officers are trained to lead soldiers. It was founded in 1741 and counts Prince Harry, Prince William and Prince Edward among its alumni. Sgt Major Holder denied one charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the grounds of self defence.","Martin Holder, 50, allegedly found James Kelt in bed with Sarah White .

"The Tower of London hosted a £240-a-head dinner for arms dealers while poppies were still being removed from the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red memorial. Nearly 200 people from the UK arms industry sipped Champagne before dining on a swanky three-course dinner just yards from the memorial to the 888,246 British servicemen killed in the First World War. The annual 'acclaimed and influential dinner' on Tuesday night was kept quiet by organisers London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), which did not publicise where the event was taking place. Protesters met arms dealers at the Tower of London as they arrived for a 'luxurious' three-course dinner just yards from the poppy memorial, which is still being removed . Nearly 200 guests from arms trade met for the dinner at the Tower of London on Tuesday night . Guests, who included senior officials from the Ministry of Defence and foreign security companies, paid up to £3,000 for tables at the LCCI's Defence and Security Dinner but were told they would be advised on its location after registering. The Tower of London was accused of 'crass insensitivity' for hosting the £240-a-head black tie dinner for weapons manufacturers at the Tower of London, where poppies from the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red memorial are still being removed. Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against the Arms Trade, told the Independent: 'On Remembrance Day, the Tower of London was a focus for remembering the horrendous loss of life in the First World War. 'It is disturbing that just weeks later it can play host to the very arms companies which profit from perpetuating war and conflict today. 'It is crassly insensitive and in extremely bad taste that this historic monument would do this so soon after providing such a high-profile focal point for Remembrance Day.' The dinner was co-sponsored by the world's largest defence firm Lockheed Martin, with Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton the guest of honour. The Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red memorial was made up of 888,246 poppies - one for each Commonwealth serviceman and woman killed in WWI . Thousands flocked to the poignant memorial to the fallen, including the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh . Publicity for the event read: 'Raise your company profile, make new business connections and entertain clients at this acclaimed and influential annual dinner. 'Your ticket includes a Champagne drinks reception, luxurious three-course meal, half a bottle of wine and mineral water.' Despite the efforts to keep the event quiet, arms manufacturers were met by protesters as they arrived for a pre-dinner drinks reception in the White Tower. Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton was guest of honour at the dinner on Tuesday night . Demonstrators were waiting at the Tower with banners, with one reading: 'Send arms dealers to the Tower. Lives saved.' The event was organised by the LCCI's defence and security committee group, made up of members of Britain's largest defence company BAE System, as well as Thales and Lockheed. The Tower of London hosted the event last year too, with guests asked to wear black tie to the New Armouries dinner. A spokeswoman for Historical Royal Palaces, who run the Tower of London, said: 'As an independent charity receiving no Government or Crown funding, we rely on income generated by commercial activities to care for the palaces and keep them open for people to enjoy. 'We are unable to confirm details of private events held at the palaces, however we always seek to ensure that such events are appropriate and compatible with our charitable status and would not wish to be associated with those who irresponsibly or illegally proliferate the arms trade. 'Our events policy states that we will work with clients who appropriately reflect the status and dignity of the palaces. In our judgement, the decision to host an event by the London Chamber of Commerce is consistent with this policy.' An LCCI spokeswoman said: 'This event is attended by those who work or have an interest in the defence and security industry, including MoD and military personnel. 'Venues are chosen based on many considerations including cost, availability, their relevance to the sector and on feedback from our members.'","Nearly 200 arms manufacturers attend  three-course dinner at the Tower .

"Queen’s Park Rangers could effectively be thrown out of football over the next few years if they fail to pay an anticipated huge fine for breaking Football League financial fair play rules. That startling prospect was raised on Tuesday by the League’s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, as he outlined ‘nuclear option’ possibilities of what could happen if QPR refuse to pay. ‘Theoretically, that is the position,’ Harvey said. ‘I would hope there would be resolution long before that option even had to be considered.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch QPR's Leroy Fer strike a stunning volley in Holland training . Expensive: QPR spent big to get back into the Premier League and have invested again to stay up . Back again: Niko Kranjcar joined the club for a second spell after an injury hit loan move last season . Under Football League rules introduced in 2012 to encourage financial stability, clubs who make huge losses as they attempt to win promotion to the Premier League face a range of punishments. If they overspend but don’t go up, they face transfer embargoes. If they overspend and do go up - as QPR overspent and went up last season - then they face huge fines. The tariff system of fines is hugely complex but in the simplest terms, QPR face a fine of £1 for every £1 over £18 million that they lost in the 2013-14 season. QPR’s losses for 2013-14 are not yet known. They lost £65.4m in 2012-13 and it is anticipated the figure will be around £60m in 2013-14, which could mean a fine of around £40m. They must let the League know the exact figure by 1 December. QPR’s owner Tony Fernandes has said he will contest any fine, and perhaps even take legal action to try to avoid paying it. Promotion: Bobby Zamora's goal at Wembley put QPR into the Premier League last May . Big money: Sandro signed for QPR from Tottenham on the final day of the transfer window . Appeal: Tony Fernandes says he will contest any fine that the Football League try and make Rangers pay . Harvey, speaking to Sportsmail today at the Soccerex conference in Manchester, said he expects clubs to pay, and that sanctions up to and including not being allowed to play in the Football League would be applicable for non-payment. QPR would not need to worry about this as long as they stayed in the Premier League. But as and when they were relegated at any stage in the future, whether that is next May, or next year or in a few years, they would face effective expulsion from league football because the League would not let them in. ‘Theoretically, that is the position,’ Harvey said. ‘I would hope there would be resolution long before that option even had to be considered. The one thing for certain is that most clubs [in the Premier League] will become a Football League club again. Game-changer: Promotion meant that the Football League could not impose a transfer embargo . Cost of success: Harry Redknapp led QPR back to the Premier League but broke financial fair play rules . ‘Now QPR will of course be hoping it does not happen for some considerable number of seasons. But the chances they will need to return to the Football League fold at some point in the future. Certainly, three of the current 20 clubs that are in the Premier League will be in the Football League next season.’ Harvey hopes that any clubs needing to pay their fines will do so, QPR included. He also hopes that if they initially refuse, then football arbitration will be possible ahead of harsher action. ‘Football has a number of processes to try to keep its debates out of court and inside a tribunal system or arbitration system under the FA’s guise,’ Harvey said. ‘Ultimately, I believe the FA would have a part to play in terms of determining the outcome between a club and a league in which they are not currently playing.’ Originally the Football League wanted to take any fines levied on rule-breaking clubs and share them between clubs who stayed within the rules. The Premier League objected to that so now any fines will be given to charity.","QPR broke rules in order to win promotion from Championship last season .

"Manchester United hope Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria will fly to their rescue on Monday after another dispiriting afternoon of Barclays Premier League football at Sunderland. United are desperate for new players and  they were in discussions with the Spanish giants over the details of the 26-year-old’s transfer, with Real trying to edge a proposed £68million transfer closer to the £75m mark at the last minute. However, both clubs have a firm desire to get the deal done and Di Maria has already said his goodbyes at the Bernabeu. VIDEO Scroll down for . Saviour?

He hopes to arrive in the North-West on Monday or Tuesday if talks are concluded to put his name to a British record transfer that will finally bring some light to United’s gloomy early season. Sunday's 1-1 draw at Sunderland leaves Louis van Gaal’s team with one point from two games and the scale of the challenge facing the Dutch veteran is clear. Van Gaal said: ‘The players are disappointed because we thought we would win — but still we have one point. That is not good enough for Manchester United. ‘I thought we lost a lot of balls in situations that I would not expect. When you lose a lot of balls you have to run after the ball also to win it back. You are not in the match. That was the first half. In the second half we were dominating but you need creative passing in the last third and that was also not so good. 'We were dominating without creating chances and that is the purpose of the game. That is disappointing. In USA on tour it (confidence) was much better than now.

United thought they had agreed a deal with Real for Di Maria on Saturday night, with the European champions accepting a £60m down-payment with a further £8m to add on depending on Di Maria’s success at Old Trafford. However, Real were on Sunday trying to move that fee higher in a game of brinkmanship that both sides — and Di Maria himself — hope will not scupper the deal. Suggestions that Manchester City are trying to get involved are untrue. The Premier League champions were offered the opportunity to bid last week and declined, despite their admiration for the player. Di Maria has told friends and team-mates that he will be moving to Old Trafford this week. He said his goodbyes at training in Madrid at the weekend and it remains to be seen if United can close the transfer. Sidelined: New signings Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera have already found themselves injured . Hobbled off: Whilst Chris Smalling added to United's injury concerns when he hobbled off at Sunderland . After their draw with Sunderland, Van Gaal — without injured new signings Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera — said: ‘When a transfer has been finished, then we can say something. But now, you have to wait and see. If the moment is there then we will announce it. But we are a big club. 'We have seven injured and now Chris Smalling (forced off with a groin strain in the first half) makes eight, so you always need players.’ Ashley Young was booked for diving in the second half when he went down under a challenge from Wes Brown. Van Gaal, however, was adamant his player had not dived, as he said: ‘Normally it is a penalty. He has been touched by the opponent in the 16-metre area and when it happens like that there are referees who are whistling.

"Isidro Miguel Delacruz, who faces a capital murder charge after being accused of slitting the throat of his ex-girlfriend's five-year-old daughter . The former stepfather of a five-year-old girl who allegedly slit her throat after he split with her mother could face the death penalty. Isidro Miguel Delacruz Junior of San Angelo, Texas faces a capital murder charge after being accused of breaking into his ex-girlfriend's home and fatally stabbing Naiya Villegas earlier this week. San Angelo police said that they were called to the home early on Tuesday when they responded to two 911 calls regarding alleged domestic violence at a house. Officers discovered the injured child, Naiya Villegas, and two more female victims, the 33-year-old mother Tanya Bermea, and her 62-year-old mother, Jesusita. All three were taken to hospital where the little girl died. The mother and grandmother had non-life threatening injuries. As the child victim was under-10, he could face the death penalty, although it has been reported no decision has yet been taken on this. According to a police report, Delacruz was seen holding paper towels to the girl's throat after she was stabbed. It is also said that he punched Miss Bermea several times, pushed her onto the sidewalk outside and began to choke her. San Angelo Police chief Tim Vasquez told the San Angelo Standard Times: 'In my time here this is probably the most horrific homicide involving a child. It’s not the only one we’ve had, but definitely for me its one of the most horrific we’ve had.' Police say Delacruz forced his way into the home through a bathroom window.

But the 34-year-old became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy after being drip fed a mixture of egg yolk extract and soya bean oil. Delight: Hannah and Simon Cope with baby Noah who was born after Hannah had intralipid infusion therapy . Mrs Cope, an auditor for United Utilities, said: 'I didn't believe it when I found out I was pregnant. 'We did this last treatment to make peace and to know we had tried everything before facing a life without children. It took a while for it to sink in and we were in fear that it would all be taken away from us. But then we had the heartbeat scan and we had to believe it.' Mrs Cope, from Littleborough, near Rochdale, gave birth to her son Noah Parker at the Royal . Oldham Hospital, five weeks early weighing 5lbs 2oz. Her husband Simon, a 40-year-old contract . administrator, said: 'It has been a hard slog for us but Noah is happy . and healthy and he is 18 weeks old now. 'We took a decision in September 2011 to start this treatment at the beginning of 2012 and it worked.' Hannah with baby Noah: She was given a drip-feed egg solution, which may have stabilised her immune system . Hannah had a condition that meant her body was attacking the embryos, causing her to miscarry. The egg solution helps to stabilise the immune system by making it harder for the body to attack a fertilised embryo. Hannah found out about the treatment through the CARE Fertility Group in Manchester after carrying out research on fertility websites. And after paying for blood tests to be carried out in America, she was advised to try the £400-a-time procedure, which isn't available on the NHS. Known as ‘intralipid . infusion therapy’, the blend of soya oil and egg products is high in . calories and essential fatty acids and is thought to have a stabilising effect on cell membranes, which makes it . harder for killer cells to attack. It is usually used as a nutritional . boost for post-operative patients and premature babies, but studies have shown the concoction has a . remarkable success rate at overcoming Mrs Cope's condition. In 2011, Dr George Ndukwe, formerly of the Care fertility clinic in Nottingham trialled the therapy on a group of 50 women who had failed . to become pregnant despite enduring an average of six IVF attempts . each. Half of those treated became pregnant, . compared with just 9 per cent of those not given the fatty substance. The findings were presented at a British Fertility Society conference. However, a review from King's College London, said larger-scale controlled studies would be needed to confirm the findings before it could be recommended for routine use. A spokesman for CARE Fertility, has said it offers the therapy to women if they think . their only problem in getting pregnant is an over-active immune system. The treatment is always administered by a qualified nurse under a doctor’s instructions. Intralipid . infusion therapy has been around for decades as a way to correct an essential fatty acid and calorie deficiency among those who are unable to eat normally. The solution contains 20 per cent soyabean oil, 1.2 per cent egg yolk phospholipids, 2.25 per cent glycerin and water. Given via an intravenous . infusion it bypasses the stomach and goes directly into the bloodstream . to supply the body with several essential fatty acids. These are . substances that can't be made by the body but are required for many biological functions, including . reproduction. Recently, doctors began to wonder whether it could be used to boost women who had immune systems that attacked their own embryos. In 2011 a mother from Derbyshire became one of the first women to be treated with the infusion alongside IVF. Suzanne Harper, from Ilkeston, conceived baby Libby after having the experimental treatment. She was one of the 50 women treated in a trial run by Dr George Ndukwe, formerly of the Care fertility clinic in Nottingham. The women had all failed . to become pregnant after an average of six IVF attempts  - yet half conceived after having the infusion. It is thought the food solution has a stabilising effect on cell membranes, which makes it . harder for killer cells to attack. However, a review from King's College London, said larger-scale controlled studies would be needed to confirm the findings before it could be recommended for routine use.","Hannah and Simon spent five years trying to conceive a child .

"So Fernando Torres’s time in English football is over and I am glad he is heading to AC Milan. I have said in these pages before that I don’t like to see players who are on big contracts sitting on the bench and hopefully a move to the San Siro will revive his confidence. When Torres joined us at Liverpool in 2007, he was in the top four strikers in world football. Big, strong and quick, he used to leave defenders trailing and his goal return was magnificent. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho visibly upset at prospect of losing Fernando Torres . The end: Fernando Torres is heading to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal from Chelsea . Jumping for joy: Torres in training with Chelsea at their base in Cobham . Machine: The Spaniard earned a reputation as one of Europe's best strikers during his time at Liverpool . Clash: Jamie Carragher was impressed by the character displayed by the Spanish striker . It was a joy to be on the same team as him during that period and what really impressed me about him was his character. He would stand up to defenders and was never someone who could be bullied out of a game. He could give as good as he got. The Torres who joined Chelsea in January 2011, though, was not the same forward who arrived from Atletico Madrid and we had seen the deterioration in him over his final 18 months at Anfield. Lethal: Torres scored 81 goals in 142 games during his three and a half years at Liverpool . Strike: Torres holds off Rio Ferdinand to score in a 2-0 win over Manchester United at Anfield in 2009 . Dry: The Spaniard only managed 45 goals for Chelsea after a £50m move to Stamford Bridge . Slowing down: Torres' pace was one of his biggest assets during his time at Liverpool . He suffered some knee and hamstring injuries and when explosive players like him are hindered by such problems, it is difficult to recapture the spark. So much of Fernando’s game was based on his pace and he found himself unable to race away from defenders as he used to. People wondered why he couldn’t do for Chelsea what he had initially done for Liverpool but we were never surprised. If anything, we were pleased with the £50million transfer fee we received for him, even if we didn’t reinvest it properly. Appearances: 142 . Goals: 81 . Goals per game ratio: 1.8 matches . Cost per goal (signed for £24m): £296,000 . Appearances: 172 . Goals: 45 . Goals per game ratio: 3.8 matches . Cost per goal (signed for £50m): £1.1m . Torres might not have scaled the heights that were expected of him in London but he still leaves with a collection of some of the game’s biggest medals. It will be interesting to see if a switch to Italy revives his goalscoring talent.","Fernando Torres will move to AC Milan on two-year loan deal .

"Floyd Mayweather believes the NFL should have stuck with its original punishment of Ray Rice, saying the league was overly influenced by new video showing Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City casino lift. The boxing superstar - who has had his own domestic abuse issues - said he didn't feel the original two-game suspension should be changed because of the video. 'I think there's a lot worse things that go on in other people's households, also,' Mayweather said. 'It's just not caught on video, if that's safe to say.' VIDEO: Watch Ray Rice knock out his then fiancee when he punches her in a lift . (WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT) Money: Floyd Mayweather questioned the NFL's decision to change Ray Rice's punishment . Showdown: The boxer is preparing for his rematch with Argentine Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas . Caught on camera: Ray Rice (right) punched his then fiancee Janay Palmer (left) in a lift in Atlantic City . Hurt: Janay Rice's Instagram post in which she reacts angrily to the media . Mayweather, who spent two months in a Las Vegas jail in 2012, still maintains his innocence even after pleading to reduced domestic abuse charges stemming from an attack on his former girlfriend while their children watched. Had Mayweather not taken the plea bargain, he would have gone to trial on felony charges that could have ended with a prison sentence of up to 34 years. Mayweather was also named in a civil lawsuit last week by his former fiancee, who said the fighter assaulted her and kept her from leaving his Las Vegas mansion. Shantel Jackson also said the boxer publicly humiliated her by posting a sonogram showing her pregnant with twins online, and then claiming she aborted them. Mayweather said he has been falsely accused many times. Calm before the storm: The couple are seen arguing in the lift in Atlantic City . Shocking: Rice punches his then fiancee in the face with his left hand, knocking her out . Out cold: Palmer was dragged from the lift after it stopped and Rice was later arrested . 'Like I've said in the past, no bumps, no bruises, no nothing,' Mayweather said. 'With O.J. and Nicole, you seen pictures. With Chris Brown and Rihanna, you seen pictures. With (Chad) Ochocinco and Evelyn, you seen pictures. You guys have yet to see any pictures of a battered woman, a woman who says she was kicked and beaten (by Mayweather). So I just live my life and try to stay positive, and try to become a better person each and every day.' Mayweather made his remarks before a small group of reporters at the MGM Grand hotel, where he made a formal fight week arrival for his rematch Saturday with Argentina's Marcos Maidana. Mayweather won a majority decision over Maidana in May but was roughed up at times in perhaps the toughest of his recent string of fights. The unbeaten 37-year-old also said he plans to fight just twice more after Maidana, finishing his career next September. He didn't specifically dismiss Manny Pacquiao as an opponent for one of those bouts - as he has repeatedly done in the past - though he said reports there had been talks on a possible fight were completely false.

"About 1.4 million years ago the ancestors of modern man constructed what is believed to be the first-ever tool: the hand axe. And now designers of reimagined what those primitive tools might be like if they came face to face with modern architecture. The results are a series of objects that highlight some specific features of the multi-purpose tool that was once used to chop, cut, attack and more. Tel-Aviv based designers have re-imagined a tool from 1.4 million years ago. The Man Made project used 3D scanning and printing to create different handles and grips. Pictured is one of the designs, a hand-held grip that could be placed in the palm of either the left or right hand . The Man Made project, an evolution of an earlier series called BC-AD, is the work of Tel-Aviv designers Dov Ganchrow and Ami Drach, the latter of whom passed away in 2012. To create the tools they first gathered flint rocks of desirable size, shape and quality from the Negev desert in southern Israel. They then moulded the fling into a pointed shape using a softer stone - a process known as knapping. By chipping away at it the flint breaks, a similar technique that was used 1.4 million years ago. ‘Needless to say, this is also where the bleeding comes in,’ the researchers add, referring to the pain that can be induced from the shockwave of each strike. Each flint hand axe was then 3D-scanned at the Hebrew University. The digital hand axe files then had handles custom-designed to highlight the varying uses of the first-ever tools. The handles were printed and then applied to each hand axe, joining two very distant technologies; flint knapping and 3D-printing. The primitive object used by the distant ancestors of modern man is believed to be the first-ever tool. On the left here is pictured an adze, a tool probably used for woodworking in a chopping-pulling motion. On the right is an example of someone holding the simple hand-gripped version . To make their own tools the designers found flint rocks in the Negev desert in southern Israel. They then used softer stones to mould the rocks into the shape they wanted just like was done 1.4 million years ago, a process known as knapping. Shown is a two-handed grasping tool for a digging or pounding motion . Our large brains, long legs and ability to craft tools are often thought to have evolved together at the start of the Homo lineage up to 2.4 million years ago. But climate and fossil evidence earlier this year shows these unique traits may have originated much earlier in our Australopithecus ancestors, between three and four million years ago. The research also suggests that rather than forming as a single package, these key traits evolved individually, over a much longer timeframe. The analysis, published in the journal Science, led the team to conclude that the ability of early humans to adjust to changing conditions ultimately enabled the earliest species of Homo to vary, survive, and begin spreading from Africa to Eurasia 1.85 million years ago. One example of an ancient use for the tool was a handle that allowed it to be gripped in the palm of the hand to strike downwards. Another had a longer handle with a hand grip to mimic an action similar to a mason hitting a chisel with a hammer. The teardrop-shaped hand axe was a prehistoric stone tool that the researchers say was ‘probably the most popular tool ever, with a span of over 1.4 million years of use and found across several continents including Europe, Asia, Africa and North America.’ The abundance and span of the stone axe in the archaeological record has led to several theories explaining its longevity. One is that its shape was an aesthetic preference, as ‘the pleasure we derive from symmetrical forms has been associated with our understanding that a person with a symmetrical body is probably healthy, and therefore desirable for mating,’ say the researchers. The versatile hand axe could also be crafted into a spear, shown here, by extending itself wedge-like into a split piece of wood. A polymer part serves as a mediator between the organic and the mineral . How was a hand axe carried? This thought resides in the clip-on holster (shown) along with the notion that if you are already carrying a stone when threatened by a predator, you will likely throw it at the predator regardless of the time invested in making it . The use of latching is illustrated in the axe with interchangeable stone-holding heads (shown). Although there are several variations of the teardrop-form, most tools of this sort were thought to follow similar geometric guidelines, namely a directional shape with a sharp edge . They add: 'Additionally, the existence of oversized or unused hand axes has fostered the idea that perhaps its purpose was a courtship object, boasting an individual's dexterity, ability to plan ahead, or to make tools, and generally to be a good provider, traits increasing the chance of survival. 'A direct parallel can be drawn to underlying cues in today's material culture: extravagant cars, jewelry and accessories or brand names (presumably) signaling an individual's social and financial standing and hence, ability to provide. 'Some speculation remains as to the hand axe's exact use, but it is generally accepted that the hand axe was a multi-tool, a tool that could be wielded in several manners, and function in various ways within changing scenarios of utilization.' It is added that although there are several variations of the teardrop-form exist, most follow similar geometric guidelines, namely a directional shape with a sharp edge. The size also needs to be one that can be grasped in one hand. The principal of indirect percussion, an action similar to a mason hitting a chisel with a hammer and transferring the force to a stone, was exemplified by the forming of a platform above the hand grip (shown left). On the right is a tool that may have been useful for cutting . This perhaps more tongue-in-cheek design for a tripod hand axe display is, according to the researchers, 'a courtship object, a means of boasting your stone tool making abilities, perhaps getting lucky and passing those traits on in evolution'","Tel-Aviv based designers have re-imagined a tool from 1.4 million years ago .

"It was late Saturday afternoon at Flushing Meadows when Andy Murray and Ivan Lendl finally caught up, having trawled through the bowels of the humming stadium complex to seek each other out. In these same corridors two years ago they celebrated the Scot's historic U.S Open championship victory, this most eyecatching player-coach relationship having done precisely what it was designed to do. The odd couple pairing – Lendl had never coached before - came to an end in Miami back in March, and now they were meeting for the first time since the 54 year-old Czech effectively walked out, citing the insufficient amount of time he was able to give to the job. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mike Dickson and Dominic Inglot preview the US Open . Together: Murray and Lendl celebrate winning Wimbledon in 2013, one of two Grand Slams they won together . Success: The pair formed an odd but impressive duo, taking Murray's game to a whole different level . It is clear that there was no personal animosity on either side and Lendl chose this weekend to break his silence on the multiple factors that lay behind his decision to quit, and open the way for another groundbreaking appointment, that of Amelie Mauresmo. Having won Wimbledon, you might have thought that Murray, who plays his first-round match today against Dutchman Robin Haase, would have needed less of his mentor's time. In fact, as Lendl revealed, he believed the opposite was the case. 'Everyone is different. And when you win a big tournament like that, it's not easy sometimes,' said Lendl. 'Some people find it easy, some people find it more difficult, and I'm glad Andy found Amelie who can give him the time he needs.' As revealed in Sportsmail earlier this month, Mauresmo has committed to 25 weeks travelling per year, while the Czech felt by the end he was only able to give barely half that. Time out: The Czech coach decided he could no longer commit enough time to Murray's game this year . 'I also felt that in my opinion Andy needed more time for the job to be done properly. Even 20 weeks was going to be hard for me and I think he needed even more than that. 'I didn't feel I could give Andy the time that he needed. That's what it was and there was nothing else behind it, which is why I have come in today to see him and the guys,' said Lendl, who travelled in from his home in the neighbouring state of Connecticut. When asked if it was also a factor that the exhilaration of winning the Olympics, U.S Open and Wimbledon would be hard to match he admits 'Yeah, and that too,' but also emphasises the changes in personal circumstances which led to the shock decision six months ago. 'It was lots of little things combined. Like playing more on the vets tour, and one of my daughters returned home (he has five in all). The youngest one is 16 and she had been away at horse riding school and but now she has come back to live with us. Ready to go: Murray kicks off his US Open challenge on Monday when he takes on Dutchman Robin Haase . Focused: The Scot says he is in good physical shape ahead of his match with Haase . 'My Mum is now 79 and lives in Prague, I need to go more to the Czech Republic than I used to. The planes are a pain in the arse. The places, the hotels - England was good, Australia was good, here it was alright. It was the smaller trips I didn't like. 'All these things combined. And you know with Andy, after his surgery and after winning Wimbledon and all that, I felt that if anything he needed more time rather than less time.' He admits that it was an awkward evening when they went out for dinner in Miami and he explained how he thought they needed to go their separate ways: 'Yes it was difficult, we sat down and I said ""Look if you can come up with a way how it can work please let me know"" but neither one of us could figure out a way of making it work. 'Some of the evenings watching him play were not easy either.,' he joked. 'Yeah it's never easy. As they say, everything good comes to an end.It was a different role, different experience and I'm very grateful for that because I never thought I would be coaching, and of course Andy winning made it that much more enjoyable.' New team: Amelie Mauresmo began coaching the British no 1 before this year's Wimbledon . Lendl was reluctant to be drawn on the subject of Mauresmo, but did offer the suggestion that she works closely with Dani Vallverdu, Murray's ever present assistant coach who has been the cornerstone of his support team. 'The person who knows Andy the best from the guys in Dani, he is fantastic. He certainly didn't get enough credit. People don't understand how much I relied on Dani. And I hope Amelie relies on Dani as well because he knows Andy so well. 'Many times he would come to me and say ""Hey, you need to stop the practice."" And I would say ""What? He's done? He looks fine to me."" And Dani would say ""No, he's done."" More to come: Lendl believes that with Mauresmo coaching him Murray has the potential to win more Slams . 'And two or three minutes later he was done. So you hear that two or three times when he's right and you start listening much better.' Lendl does not rule out a return to coaching: 'Maybe eventually if the situation is right. But the time now is not right. It wouldn't have worked if Andy had called me two years earlier, or if he had called me two years later. 'And it has to be someone I feel I can offer something to. If it was John Isner for example I am not going to be able to tell him how to hit a serve.' What he is convinced about is Murray's ability to win more Slams: 'Andy's a great player. He can, simple as that. He is fully capable of winning more majors.'","Lendl coached Murray to his only US Open victory two years ago .

"Chelsea fans are no strangers to watching their team's young talents get farmed out on loan to various corners of the world, but the curious case of Gael Kakuta is one that has left the Blues faithful with a few raised eyebrows. Once labelled the next Zinedine Zidane, Kakuta was so sought after in 2007 that Chelsea risked a FIFA transfer ban to acquire the Frenchman's signature. The west London club were close to being banned from signing new players for two transfer windows in 2009 after FC Lens claimed Chelsea illegally induced the French-youth team player to join Chelsea. Journeyman: Gael Kakuta has been loaned out to six different clubs in during his time at Chelsea . Bright start: Kakuta celebrates scoring against Manchester City during the FA Youth Cup final first leg in 2008 . Luckily for the Blues, Lens agreed to drop the complaint after being paid a fee of around £1million for Kakuta. It's now been three years and eight months since Kakuta has made a senior appearance for Chelsea to add to his just six Premier League showings in a blue shirt, which is a figure that looks less and less likely to increase as the former Lens youngster embarks on his sixth loan move. The 23-year-old has now been shipped out to Fulham, Bolton, Dijon, Vitesse, Lazio and Rayo Vallecano but not one club has been impressed enough to enquire about a long-term deal for Kakuta. Rare: The French youngster celebrates with Michael Essien during a Champions League match in 2009 . Risk: Kakuta signed for Chelsea in 2007 from Lens in a move that was shrouded in controversy . Former Leeds United prodigies Tom Taiwo and Michael Woods are further example of Chelsea's youth development system going awry. The pair moved to the Blues in 2006 in another highly controversial transfer after former Chelsea chairman Ken Bates accused his old side of 'tapping up' the talented duo. Chelsea were eventually ordered to pay £5million in compensation to the Yorkshire outfit for two players that failed to make the grade having been given little chance to impress. Taiwo didn't make a single appearance for the Chelsea first team while Woods made a handful of substitute appearances before moving on. Although Chelsea's managerial merry-go-round over the last six years won't have helped Kakuta's cause, there is clearly underlying issues whether its his attitude or lack of attitude at the top level. Kakuta isn't the first and is unlikely to be the last promising youngster to fall foul of Chelsea's loan system, with 26 players currently plying their trade away from Stamford Bridge. 21-year-old midfielder Josh McEachran looks to be another Blues youngster that has failed to fit in after a bright start in the Chelsea first team set-up. Shipped out: The 23-year-old hasn't played a competitive game for Chelsea in five years . Out: The 23-year-old has now been shipped out to Fulham, Bolton, Dijon, Vitesse, Lazio and Rayo Vallecano . McEachran blossomed under Carlo Ancelotti in 2010, but failed to gain similar trust from other Chelsea managers since the Italian's sacking in 2011. If he could have his time again, Kakuta may wish that he could start again with Jose Mourinho at a time in which the Chelsea boss looks keen to give opportunities to the current crop of Stamford Bridge youngsters. The Frenchman may have been over land and sea in an attempt to prove himself in different colours, but his time at Chelsea looks all but over.

"A federal judge has approved a $41 million settlement between New York City and five men wrongfully convicted of the 1989 rape of a woman jogger in Central Park, ending a decade-long civil rights lawsuit stemming from the infamous crime. The settlement’s details had been previously reported but were publicly disclosed for the first time on Friday, when U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis in New York signed off on the deal. The brutal attack, known as the 'Central Park Jogger' case, drew national headlines and was cited as evidence that the city's crime rate had spiraled out of control. Exonerated: (L-R) Korey Wise, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, and Yusef Salaam, pictured at a film premiere two years ago, won the largest wrongful conviction settlement in New York's history . Write caption here . Real perpetrator: Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer, confessed in 2002 and DNA testing connected him to he scene . The five men, all black or Hispanic teenagers at the time, were arrested soon after the assault on 28-year-old Trisha Meili, a white investment banker. The men confessed following lengthy interrogations but later recanted, claiming their admissions were the result of exhaustion and police coercion. The men were eventually exonerated after Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer, confessed in 2002; DNA testing would tie him to the scene. By then, however, all five had served prison terms. Korey Wise, who at 16 was the oldest at the time of the attack, served 13 years and will receive $12.25 million. The other four - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Yusef Salaam - will be paid $7.125 million each, or roughly $1 million for each year of imprisonment. The settlement appears to be the largest in a wrongful conviction case in the city's history and is in line with some of the biggest recent jury verdicts in such cases, suggesting the city did not receive a significant discount by settling. Largest deal: Korey Wise, who at 16 was the oldest at the time of the attack, served 13 years and will receive $12.25 million . Write caption here . But a deal seemed a foregone conclusion after Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected last year, following a campaign in which he vowed to end the litigation. His predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, had fiercely fought the lawsuit. 'This settlement is an act of justice for those five men that is long overdue,' de Blasio said in a statement on Friday. The city did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement. The city's top lawyer, Zachary Carter, said in a statement that a review of the record suggested the detectives and prosecutors who handled the original investigation ""acted reasonably, given the circumstances."" In an email, Wise's lawyer, Jane Fisher-Byrialsen, said her client hoped to work with charities that help former inmates. 'I am grateful that Korey has come to the end of this very long road,' she said. The agreement is one of several major civil rights settlements under de Blasio, indicating he may take a less combative approach to such cases than Bloomberg did. In February, the administration agreed to pay Brooklyn man David Ranta $6.4 million for his wrongful conviction for murdering a rabbi in 1990; Jabbar Collins, a Brooklyn man erroneously convicted in the 1994 killing of another rabbi, will get $10 million under a deal reached last month. In July, the city agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle claims that a Rikers Island jail inmate died in 2012 after guards beat him. Write caption here .","The five men, all black or Hispanic .

"The RCM said while midwife numbers were increasing a little, the strain on numbers has led to antenatal care of expectant mothers becoming 'threadbare' Women in labour are being turned away from maternity units as midwives are overwhelmed by record numbers of births. With immigrants helping push birth rates in England to their highest level for 40 years, more than half of maternity wards admit shutting their doors an average of seven times a year when the strain on midwives becomes too great. Expectant women who then turn up are sent away to other hospitals. Research by The Royal College of Midwives says that thousands of new midwives are needed if the ‘massive gap’ in staffing is to be plugged, the ‘relentless rise in births’ handled and for mothers and babies to be given the quality of care they need. Yesterday Cathy Warwick, chief . executive of the RCM, warned of ‘threadbare’ services with midwives . ‘running themselves ragged’. She said: ‘Maternity units are under . intense strain, with many midwives really at the end of their tether. We . are reaching a crucial tipping point for maternity services.’ The RCM’s State Of Maternity Services . report, which will be launched at an event in Parliament tomorrow, says . that although there have been attempts to boost midwife numbers, England . alone still needs another 5,000 – an increase of about a quarter on . today’s level. Office for National Statistics figures . show there were 688,120 babies born in England in 2011, the most since . 1971. The trend seems set to continue, with provisional data for 2012 . pointing to it being another record-breaker and ONS projections . suggesting the birth rate in England could hit 743,000 by 2014. Corby in Northamptonshire saw the . biggest baby boom, with a 63 per cent jump between 2002 and 2011 – three . times the rise across England as a whole. Other hotspots include . Bournemouth, with a 54 per cent increase, Boston, Lincolnshire (53.5 per . cent), the London borough of Barking and Dagenham (52.5 per cent) and . Slough in Berkshire, which saw a 50.5 per cent rise. Immigration is one factor, with . foreign-born mothers now having nearly a quarter of all babies in . Britain, but the RCM report says midwives are also struggling to look . after record numbers of older mothers, who are more prone to . complications. Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, has warned England alone needs an extra 5,000 midwives . The report follows a survey of new mothers which found . that despite a Government pledge for mothers-to-be to have their care . overseen by one midwife, 40 per cent always saw a different one. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said . that more than 800 new midwives have started work since 2010, and 5,000 . more are due to qualify in the next three years. He added: ‘The number of midwives is . increasing faster than the birth rate. Most women already have . one-to-one maternity care, and we are working closely with The Royal . College of Midwives to ensure that is available for every woman.’ Thousands of patients are at risk from . appalling care reminiscent of scandal-hit Stafford Hospital, the health . secretary has claimed. Jeremy Hunt’s warning comes just weeks . before the report of a public inquiry into the deaths of up to 1,200 . people from poor care in the hospital’s A&E department between 2005 . and 2009. He said that while there are no . hospitals as bad as Stafford, ‘there are little bits of Stafford dotted . around the system’. He added: ‘The biggest change the NHS needs to make . is to embed compassion at the heart of what it does.’","Royal College of Midwives warns of massive shortage in parts of UK .
