"(CNN) -- The British invasion continues. Fox recently announced a new show airing soon -- ""Take Me Out"" -- from the producers of ""American Idol"" and ""X Factor."" The dating reality show premieres in June and marks yet another remake yanked from the tellies of the United Kingdom. Although it follows other British reboots ashore, the journey over can be choppy. When Adam Ferrara emerged from his broken '76 Coupe de Ville on the first season of ""Top Gear USA,"" his co-hosts Tanner Foust and Rutledge Wood raised their hands ... to bestow upon each other a round of enthusiastic high fives. For many fans of the wry attitude of ""Top Gear"" Classic, this show of dude-ly appreciation was a cringe-worthy moment. The U.S. edition of the world's favorite car show has been gaining in viewership on History, yet continues to be a point of controversy with hardcore fans of the British original, which airs here on BBC America. As one of the most popular TV shows worldwide (with men and women alike), many questioned the need for a high-fiving American overhaul. It's part of a bigger debate found everywhere from newspaper columns to online trending topics. When rumors flared up of a possible ""Doctor Who"" movie, showrunner Steven Moffat -- whose other hit ""Sherlock"" is under threat of a knock-off as CBS's ""Elementary"" -- tweeted: ""To clarify: any Doctor Who movie would be made by the BBC team, star the current Doctor and certainly NOT be a Hollywood reboot."" Not that a UK-to-U.S. conversion hasn't ever worked. ""Three's Company,"" ""Sanford & Son,"" and ""All in the Family"" had great casts and excellent writing, but they also benefited from the originals not being readily available for comparison. For a remake to thrive in the Internet age -- and in a crowded market where both UK and U.S. versions air on competing channels -- it has to pave its own road. The American version of ""The Office"" didn't click until it worked through the original scripts and settled into its own routine. The characterizations made more sense too: where Ricky Gervais' David Brent was belligerent and mean-spirited, Steve Carell's Michael Scott was merely awkward and sometimes even kind. Scott was a more relatable boss for the American workplace; Brent wouldn't survive one season stateside without being sacked by HR. But the recipe is delicate. The forced comedy of ""Coupling"" didn't land. ""Skins"" was deemed too smutty for U.S. standards. ""Prime Suspect""â€” which starred Maria Bello (and a fabulous hat) in place of the legendary Helen Mirren â€” turned ITV's sleeper procedural into a weekly one-hour version of that scene in ""Pulp Fiction"" where Jules and Vincent ""hang back"" to debate foot massages before busting in on the main action. Bill Young, keeper of the Brit TV blog Tellyspotting, as well as VP of programming for KERA/Dallas -- the very PBS station that set ""Monty Python"" loose on the American public in 1974 -- feels the key to a successful translation lies in subtlety. ""There seems to be a feeling that with American audiences you need to lay everything out on a platter so that the audience doesn't have to think. British television takes the opposite approach,"" which he explained had to do with pacing, meticulous casting, and relatable locations. For anyone who grew up quoting Basil Fawlty, watched ""Doctor Who"" when only the math geeks did, or gambled on the color of Mrs. Slocombe's hair with their dorm mates (pink was a safe bet), there has never been a more exciting time for a British TV invasion. PBS period charmer ""Downton Abbey"" is a cult phenomenon, Idris Elba's ""Luther"" kicks down doors as a new style of gritty detective, and ""Doctor Who"" is oh-so-very cool now. ""Top Gear"" host Richard Hammond is even filming a new show -- in America, for America -- as part of an original-programming experiment by BBC America. It might be time to just let the Redcoats in. (Preferably with Hammond's cohort Jeremy Clarkson manning a beach-bombing Ford Fiesta.) Multiple channels are importing original British programming. Online streaming service Hulu has steadily been adding free programs close to their UK airdates, including the cult action/sci-fi hit ""Misfits"" (currently undergoing a U.S. pilot treatment by ""Chuck"" creator Josh Schwartz) and the award-winning comedy ""Spy."" They've recently begun streaming the UK version of ""Skins."" Although as Young pointed out, stateside reality hits ""Antiques Roadshow,"" ""American Idol"" and ""Dancing with the Stars"" did all originate as British creations, which could mean good news for ""Take Me Out."" ""Maybe it's just comedy and drama that have difficulty traveling across the pond. Which is odd, because comedy should be comedy no matter where you are,"" Young said. Speaking of translated transatlantic comedy, the industry is in on the joke: Matt LeBlanc -- currently the fastest Star in a Reasonably Priced Car on the British ""Top Gear"" -- won a Golden Globe for Showtime's ""Episodes"" which is a series about the American bastardization of a popular British sitcom.","British TV shows have been rebooted and imported to the U.S.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The East is Red restaurant is unlikely to end up in many international guidebooks as a must-visit destination in Beijing. Sitting on the outskirts of the Chinese capital city, the eatery chose its moniker after the famous Maoist song of the same name and is themed around China's Cultural Revolution (1966-76), an era which many would rather forget. And yet on any given night of the week, the restaurant gathers a large and boisterous crowd. Waiters race around dressed as red guards, the student army force of the time. Revolutionary posters decorate the walls and red flags deck the tables. The central draw is a stage, where entertainers sing ""red"" revolutionary songs and perform mock struggle sessions. People in the audience cheer and sing along; some even cry. The East is Red is just one of many venues in Beijing that gives the Cultural Revolution a makeover, repackaging what was once a tragedy into a gimmick. Some have been kicking around since the late 1990s, while others are more recent additions. ""It was really exciting,"" commented 26-year-old Yin Hang of his recent trip to one. ""Everything was new to me. I knew a bit about that part of history from my parents but I don't feel a connection to it."" It seems strange to use this period of Chinese history as entertainment. After all, the Cultural Revolution, which was Mao Zedong's political campaign aimed at rekindling revolutionary zeal, saw violence spread throughout the country. By its end an estimated 36 million had been persecuted, with at least 750,000 of those killed in the countryside alone. Countless historical relics were destroyed, and universities closed, depriving many young people of years of education. Though the Cultural Revolution has been largely erased from official discourse on the People's Republic, its horrors relegated to an appendage in history books. Those who did not live through the Cultural Revolution know it was a difficult time, but few grasp the extent. This historical amnesia might explain why some young Chinese in particular can enjoy the venues. ""China's historical memory is very barren, so even recent events can fall through a gap,"" said James Palmer, a longtime China watcher who visited one of these venues as part of field research for a book he wrote on the death of Mao, whose passing away marked the end of the Cultural Revolution. ""If you detach it from the political context it is just fun, like a Tudor-themed bar in England,"" Palmer added. But Palmer also sees more to the trend. Although people are critical of the Cultural Revolution, the era isn't only remembered for its destruction. Memories are mixed. ""While a lot saw the time as horrific, enough people had a good experience and associate the period with a sense of freedom and youth,"" Palmer said. This is especially the case for those who came of age during the era, such as Zhang Mei. Zhang was born in 1957 and has lived in Beijing her whole life. During the Cultural Revolution she enjoyed traveling around the country for free, and divided her time between school and youth parades. For her, these venues provide an avenue for nostalgia. ""When I went to the restaurant they called me 'comrade', the common greeting of the time. It felt intimate,"" Zhang said, adding that the singing made her happy because the ballads belong to her generation. However, not all look at the Cultural Revolution through red tinted spectacles. Sasha Gong, who co-wrote The Cultural Revolution Cookbook (2011), is one of them. For Gong, the book was written not to capitalize on the trend to consume positive aspects of the Cultural Revolution, but rather to educate the masses about all aspects, good and bad. ""Even though the Cultural Revolution is very recent history, people don't know much about it. This is especially the case in the West, where they can romanticize it,"" Gong said. Gong was part of the sent-down youth movement at the time, which saw thousands of children taken away from their parents and sent to work in the countryside. Writing the book was ""a cathartic experience -- a way to go back to a recent, difficult period,"" she said. ""The Cultural Revolution was terrible, one of the worst human experiences anyone can have."" Gong admits the irony of writing a cookbook about a period that had little food. But even though it was a time of austerity, her generation learned how to cherish food and create delicious, healthy dishes. In this respect Gong shares something in common with another group of people who visit these venues in Beijing. They are those who hark back to a time, real or imagined, that they deem better than contemporary China. Cultural Revolution food might be tainted by unpleasant memories, but at least it was not tainted by pesticides. And for some, especially the post-Mao generation, they feel ambivalence not just towards current food, but also current politics. ""The Cultural Revolution is essentially a religious experience, an ideological break from the China of now. They associate the government today with materialism and believe the government stance that the Cultural Revolution was bad is just propaganda,"" said Palmer of this group, who are labeled neo-Maoists. Among the most notorious of Beijing's neo-Maoists is Fan Jinggang, who was born in 1976 and currently manages the Utopia bookstore, a shop that specializes in books praising the late Chinese leader and his policies, and criticizing reform era capitalism. Earlier this year, Fan got into trouble due to his support of Bo Xilai's revival of ""red culture"" in Chongqing. Bo's policies involved the employment of nostalgic Maoist propaganda and a harsh crackdown on businessmen accused of corruption. They gained him notoriety, as well as enemies, who attacked them as throwbacks to the Cultural Revolution. In the days immediately following Bo's removal from his post as head of Chongqing and Party Secretary on March 15, Fan was paid an unfriendly visit by the authorities. The popular website attached to his bookstore has since been suspended. CNN was unable to reach Fan to ask his thoughts on the Cultural Revolution, but in an interview with Chinese site Danwei back in April, Fan is quoted as saying, ""...some traitors in the Party betrayed communism and created all sorts of rumors to attack Chairman Mao."" Despite these recent events, the atmosphere at Utopia remains upbeat, as does the atmosphere at other venues that market the Cultural Revolution in Beijing. Perhaps they simplify and trivialize the era. However, they still bring people closer to an otherwise rarely mentioned period of recent Chinese history, and in so doing, shed light on China today.","Some venues in Beijing celebrate the Cultural Revolution .

"Sheffield, England (CNN) -- Everyone thinks I'm a woman in a man's world, but to me I'm just a boxer doing the sport I love. It's been with me since I was a child. My dad had videos of all the great fighters -- Sugar Ray Leonard, Muhammad Ali. I watched them winning their Olympic medals and world titles and saw those big crowds and thought to myself, ""that looks exciting."" Then one night when I was 12 years old, my mum couldn't get a babysitter for me and my brother, so she took us down to the gym with her. They had an after-school boxing class, so I joined in and absolutely loved it. Everybody I met down there became like a little family to me. They'd take me to boxing exhibitions and shows, introduce me to new people and we'd all just stick together. This was so important for my development because it meant I always wanted to be there, I always felt supported and knew that there were people who believed in me. You have to remember that being a great boxer is only 50% physical; the rest is mental. You have to be really confident, calm, relaxed and focused. You've got to get in there thinking ""I can win. I can achieve this."" More from Human to Hero: Prima ballerina Svetlana Zakharova . My first competitive bout was really fun. I remember peering behind the curtain, peeping out and seeing all my friends and family in the crowd waiting for it to begin. There weren't many female boxers around at that time, it was very rare, so I just wanted to get in there and perform and show off my skills. That's when I remember thinking, ""yeah, I love this sport!"" But it wasn't easy to get to where I am now. All the training from such a young age has been tough. A standard day involves a run in the morning, followed by strength and conditioning exercises -- where I do weights, press ups, pull ups -- and then a boxing session which includes bags, pads, and sparring. There are times you have to run through the rain and it's cold and it's minus whatever degrees outside, but you just have to get up and you go and do the work. And on top of that everything you eat is monitored. You can't just go out and have a McDonald's or a pizza when you want, you have to be so strict on yourself. There's no way of finding the motivation for doing it unless you absolutely love the sport. You've got to really love it like nothing else otherwise you won't get through the training. That's why I don't see it as a sacrifice. I see it as things I want to do, I choose to do. I choose to not go out clubbing and drinking with my friends because I want to be a great boxer. But life can get in your way no matter how dedicated you are, no matter how hard you train. Having hardly sustained any injuries in the ring -- just one broken thumb -- I seriously put my back out in 2009 when I tripped over a bandage hanging out of my bag. I got up and didn't feel in too much pain. In fact, I even went to a tournament and it wasn't until a few weeks later that the pain got worse and worse. They took me to the doctors and found a crack in one of my vertebrae -- I was out of boxing for a year. I had to have complete bed rest for three to four months. It was so difficult because I'm a get-up-and-go person. I like to run around, see what's going on. To be laid in bed, brace put on to keep my spine in line, it was really hard to pick myself up again. More from Human to Hero: Molecular gastronomy chef Heston Blumenthal . There were moments when I thought I couldn't continue, but my friends and family helped me through the hard times, and I just managed to make it back in time for the last assessment camp and make the team. It was almost like it was meant to be. Then came the Olympic final against Cancan. I just remember thinking, whatever she does I'm going to do 10 times better; she throws a punch I'll throw five back. She bought out the very best in me in that match. The 10 seconds before I was told that I'd won, I already knew it. I could feel it, I was just thinking I can't believe that I've done this; I can't believe I'm going to be Olympic champion in front of my home audience. Winning the medal meant everything; all the hard work, all the ups and downs, highs and lows, everything in my life has revolved around boxing. So for me, winning the gold medal was everything I dreamed about as a kid. By putting women's boxing in the Olympics, they showed that women can and should be allowed to do any sport they choose. It's all about equality, it's time for a change.","British boxer Nicola Adams is the first ever Olmypic gold medalist in women's boxing .

"(CNN) -- An entire nation stopped Sunday. Four million people sat watching on their television, hearts palpitating with every movement. It was time. Another 40,000 packed into Schladming with just one hope. Amidst the roars, step forward Marcel Hirscher, the 23-year-old with the weight of all Austria on his shoulders. For two weeks the Austrian public had watched and waited for Hirscher to deliver that moment of magic, that performance which would go down in folklore. On Sunday, faced with his last chance of chance of glory, the home favorite delivered, sealing victory in the men's slalom to spark scenes of wild celebration. The 23-year-old came home in an aggregate of 1min 51.03 seconds, 0.42 seconds ahead of Germany's Felix Neureuther, with fellow Austrian and former two-time world champion Mario Matt, claiming bronze at 0.65 seconds. ""It was very difficult,"" Hirscher told reporters. ""It was fierce. What can I say, it's great. ""The atmosphere was sensational, it was great. But I was so focused and just tried not to make a mess. It was anything but easy."" Hirscher said the lead up to the slalom had been ""the toughest week in my life so far"". ""The whole country was watching me, especially for the slalom. Around four million people were watching on television in Austria and 40,000 are here live in the stadium. If I'd straddled, oh my god, they're going to kill me! ""It's definitely good to be the world champion here in my home country."" With the cowbells greeting his victorious arrival at the finish line, Hirscher soaked up the adulation in front of an adoring crowd. But while Hirscher was left to reflect on his victory, U.S. star Ted Ligety's bid to win a fourth gold at the championships was ended following an uncharacteristic error. Ligety, who had won gold in the Super-G, super-combined and giant slalom, was the first man to achieve such a feat since Claude Killy in 1968. But his failure around a gate and the sight of his skis breaking free, ended Ligety's attempt to make history. While Ligety failed, Germany's Neureuther had no such problems, claiming silver. ""I really tried not to make the same mistakes I've done in the past in big events,"" he told reporters. ""I didn't have an ideal run. Marcel did it really great again today."" Bronze medalist Matt added: ""I trusted in myself to do it and I couldn't do anything but go full out. ""But you can't race senselessly. I'm very happy with the bronze medal, you have to be happy when you see how tight the field is in slalom.""","Marcel Hirscher won the men's slalom at the World Championships Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A 16-year-old North Carolina girl who disappeared while visiting family in Baltimore continues to be the object of an intense search by authorities, who now say they fear she was abducted or harmed. ""We are enormously concerned,"" Baltimore police spokesman Anthony J. Guglielmi said Friday. ""Every day that passes we get more and more freaked out."" Phylicia Barnes, a Charlotte, North Carolina, resident who was in Baltimore to visit her college-age half-sister, was last seen December 28, after saying she was going out to get something to eat and maybe a haircut, Guglielmi said. As recently as Tuesday, police said they had no evidence that foul play was involved in her disappearance. But now they say she has not made contact with friends or family, and hasn't turned on her cell phone, used an ATM or updated her social media sites since she disappeared. The FBI did a profile on the girl and found no reason she would run away, Guglielmi said. She is a good student with no emotional disturbances in her life, he said. ""The fact set of this case is different than anything else we've seen,"" he said. More than 100 Baltimore police, Maryland State Police troopers and FBI agents have been working around the clock to find out what happened to Barnes, Guglielmi said. Police have questioned a dozen people believed to have had contact with her in the hours before she disappeared, and have searched the homes and cars of some of those people, he said. They also have collected 40 hours of video from surveillance cameras at nearby businesses and apartment buildings, but neither those videos nor searches conducted in two locations have helped give investigators any leads, Guglielmi said. On Thursday, they turned to posting billboards along I-95 in hope of gathering information about the girl's fate. ""What's going to break this thing wide open is that somebody, whether it's (in) Kansas or Canada, is going to say, wait a minute, I just saw her in a diner,"" Guglielmi said Friday. ""That's in the best case."" Although Guglielmi said there was no evidence of illegal drug use at the apartment, the girl's mother, Janice Sallis, said she has been told the girl may have been allowed to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana at her half-sister's apartment, according to CNN and CNN affiliate WSOC. Sallis said she had been told up to 20 men had come and gone while her daughter was there. ""I pray to God that my daughter is fine and she'll be found safe,"" Barnes' father, Russell Barnes, told CNN affiliate WBAL. ""I hope people keep praying as high as they can and understand that this shouldn't happen to any child anywhere in this country.""

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Seventy-two people died and 33 were injured Sunday night when an IranAir passenger jet en route from Tehran to the northwest city of Orumiyeh crashed as it attempted to make an emergency landing in a snowy field, an official said.

"(CNN) -- I made my debut for South Africa at the age of 21. It was a very special day in my life being able to represent my country, but unfortunately it ended after seven minutes when I tore a ligament in my knee. It wasn't a great start to my international career, although I returned after nine months of rehabilitation. The most challenging part of rugby, I would say, without a shadow of a doubt, is the injuries -- and I've had a few in my career. While you are going through it you don't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I've grown a lot as a person and become closer to my family and friends. A lot of the time you blame everyone for what happened to you but you just need to take it on the chin and work harder to get back to the top. I was pretty lucky when I grew up that I went to quite a good rugby school. I think the coaches I had were very good and they played a big part in my development as a rugby player. I think the 1995 World Cup final was probably one of the best days in South African history (it was the first major sporting event to take place in South Africa after the end of apartheid and South Africa won). It has got such a big part to play in uniting the nation and was definitely the best day that we've had as a rainbow nation since 1992 (when white South Africans voted to end apartheid). Read related: Wheelchair warrior in the world of 'murderball' I grew up in Paarl (a small town in South Africa's Western Cape province) and I remember running in the streets with the national flag and seeing everyone outside and (car horns) hooting. It was a fantastic day. It showed what sport can do to unify a nation -- and definitely what rugby can do in South Africa. When South Africa won the World Cup in 2007, it was a bit different for me because I got injured in the first game -- and ruptured my bicep. Even though I was part of the team and got my gold medal for winning, it was a bit of an empty feeling. I never really felt that I deserved it, but that was a great day, (especially) when the team arrived back in South Africa to see the faces of millions of South Africans. I think that's the pleasure you get from playing rugby -- to see the difference that you can make in the lives of others. I met Nelson Mandela and took a photo with him and the William Webb Ellis Cup (awarded to the winner of the Rugby World Cup) when we won it in 2007. That was very special. He is an unbelievable person and I was very fortunate to meet him. He has a great love of rugby. It was funny, a couple of times he came to our games. Let's say of the five or six times he came, we played unbelievably well and won all of those games. He's just got that aura to get the best out of any person. Read related: Boxing's first female Olympic gold medalist: 'I thought I couldn't continue' My role on the pitch is taking the decisions, making sure I handle the referee in a good way and making sure I get the message across to the team. When I feel some of the calls are going against us my role is to be able to have a talk to the referee to get a feel for where we're at and what we need to change -- maybe put a little bit more pressure on him to get the calls to go our way. Playing under South Africa's first black coach (Peter de Villiers) was good for me. I played under him in the Under-19 team. He was a different coach, he had different methods and I think a lot of the time he was misunderstood. But I think it was great for South Africa to have him there and he did a good job. It's difficult to single out one guy who is my toughest opponent, but because I've been playing for 10 years, I would say a combination of Tana Umaga, Stirling Mortlock, Brian O'Driscoll and more recently Sonny Bill Williams and Ma'a Nonu -- it's always a great challenge playing against those guys.

"Valdagno, Italy (CNN) -- It may not attract the TV audiences, armchair pundits and tasty endorsement deals that football does, but for Pedro Gil, roller hockey is everything. ""I live for this sport,"" he says. ""It's a low profile sport, it's small, but for me it's the greatest thing of all."" As captain of Spain's roller hockey team, Pedro Gil has won five World Cups, seven consecutive European Championships and three Nations Cups. Last year, Gil was decorated by the Spanish government for his services to sport, and invited to kick off a Real Madrid game. He has now represented his country for 13 years and says, ""to wear your national team shirt is an indescribable, special moment."" More from Human to Hero: 'Lucky' F1 driver lost both legs and triumphed with Paralympic gold . Roller hockey is played throughout Europe and North America, but is dominated by Portugal and Spain, who have won 15 world titles apiece since 1936. Played with a ball (rather than a puck), on quad skates (rather than inline), and with rules similar to those of polo (rather than ice hockey), it is played at breakneck speeds. ""Last year there was a study which said that a shot with a stick in roller hockey is around 120 km [75mph] per hour,"" Gil says. ""At 120 or 130 km per hour, you would hope we would score a goal!"" Gil began playing when he was four years old, the first in his family to take up the sport, which is especially popular in his native Catalonia. ""We used to live opposite the roller hockey rink in my village,"" he says. ""One day I asked my parents to register me, and since then I started and never stopped! ""Every Saturday and Sunday, I went with my brother after he was born, and we were always at the rink playing."" By the age of 16, Gil was playing for Spain's winning team in the European Youth Cup, winning in front of a crowd of 8,000. He was 21 when he played his first World Cup match, beating Argentina on their home turf. ""I think those are my two most cherished memories of my sporting career,"" he says.

Training each day on the weak points improves you as an all-round player."" ""I never thought I would make anything of myself, and I've been fortunate to get where I am through hard work,"" he says. ""I don't know who I can thank ... I suppose myself, for my constant work and dedication."" Being one of the best players in the world only motivates Gil to train harder, he says. ""I feel a great responsibility. I got here through lots of work and lots of training, and lots of sacrifices."" Being captain also confers responsibility -- that of having ""to show why you're captain."" Gil says he has to be the first to training and must take novice players under his wing. Above all, he says, ""as captain, you're defending your country!"" Although his dedication to roller hockey is absolute, Gil does allow himself one ""vice:"" He has more than 40 tattoos, including one depicting his old shirt number (nine). ""I started when I was very young, and bit by bit I continued with my vice,"" he says.

Having played for Spanish and Portuguese clubs, Gil this year joined an Italian club he describes as ""small in size, but huge in ambition:"" Valdagno is a small mountain village in the north of Italy. ""It's a tiny place, but very welcoming, and crazy about roller hockey,"" Gil says. ""It's the biggest sport in the town, which was my motivation for coming here."" At 32, Gil says, he is ""getting on a bit,"" but intends to continue playing for as long as possible. ""Why not, if the coach still believes in me? If I can play until I'm 34, that would be great ... the more years, the happier I'll be."" ""I would like to continue, and to help the team to more victories. I will never get tired of winning.

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- As Democrats gather in Charlotte this week to nominate Barack Obama for president again, we have an opportunity to convey a clear and convincing message. With many voters still undecided and even more with no intention to vote at all, the Democratic Party must work hard to explain what it has done so far and what it wants to do next. It must also highlight the stark differences between the two parties. Fortunately, the men and women tasked with key speaking roles this week are insightful, loyal and exciting Democrats. Schlossberg Opinion: Young voters, don't give up on Obama . Although we can expect each speaker to explain every reason to re-elect Obama, we can look to certain ones to speak on specific issues with authority, experience and passion. Americans can watch and listen to former President Bill Clinton defend and applaud the president's economic record. Clinton, perhaps more than anyone, understands the severity of the mess inherited by Obama. After all, Clinton handed then President George W. Bush a budget surplus in 2001 and saw it grow into the largest deficit in our nation's history. Clinton understands what is like to make the tough decisions from the Oval Office and he says Obama is the right man for the job. First lady will set the tone for the convention with Tuesday speech . Americans should pay close attention to Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as he details Obama's foreign policy record. Kerry's chairmanship, his record as a decorated war hero, and his long-time involvement in American foreign policy mean that his perspective carries tremendous weight. Issues of national security are to be taken seriously as is Kerry's judgment of the president. And in the keynote address â€” the first ever by a Hispanic â€” Americans can expect to hear how San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro's inspiring family story is a reflection of the American dream that we all share. Castro can explain better than most the hard work and determination required to succeed. He can detail exactly how the Democratic Party intends to ensure that those opportunities remain available to all American children. Rising Latino star in Democratic Party to deliver keynote address . The most anticipated speech will be when my mother, Caroline Kennedy, takes the stage on Thursday to talk about my teenage years in much detail. Actually, she'll explain how President Obama has kept alive the dream fought for by her father and uncles. Finally, to see behind the president's cool exterior and better understand him as a man, husband and father, Americans can watch first lady Michelle Obama speak on behalf of the man she loves. Mrs. Obama knows where our president's heart is and she can speak to his character with more conviction than anyone else. Americans should listen to their first lady as she explains her husband as only she can.","Democrats must work hard in Charlotte to show the sharp contrast between the two parties .

"New York (CNN) -- Federal investigators have joined local and state law enforcement in an effort to track down and prosecute Ann Pettway, who is suspected in the 1987 abduction of Carlina Renae White, according to a law enforcement source. A warrant was issued Friday in North Carolina for the arrest of Pettway, for violating her two-year probation sentence on attempted embezzlement charges, according to North Carolina Department of Corrections spokeswoman Pamela Walker. ""As part of her probation she must seek permission to leave the state of North Carolina,"" Walker said. ""At this time no such request has been made."" That said, if she is arrested, Pettway would be prosecuted at the federal level for allegedly kidnapping White, then an infant. White's mother said she never gave up hope that she would be reunited with her daughter, who had been missing for 23 years. ""I just always believed that she would find me,"" Joy White told the New York Post this week after seeing her daughter for the first time since she was just 19 days old. White last saw her daughter on August 4, 1987, when she took her to a Harlem hospital because the baby had an extremely high fever, a New York police official said. Carlina was admitted to the hospital, and White went home to rest. When the mother returned, Carlina was gone. ""That was a big part of my heart that just was ripped apart,"" Carlina White's biological father, Carl Tyson, told the Post of his daughter's disappearance. Carlina White has told the Post that the woman who raised her is Pettway, who she said was pregnant in 1987, but lost her baby. ""Nobody knew because she was pregnant and came back with me,"" White said. ""She had something set up."" But White, who was raised under a different name, had nursed a nagging feeling that she was brought up by a family she did not belong to, said Ernie Allen of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. And her suspicions grew stronger after the woman who raised her could not provide her with a birth certificate. White said she wondered: ""Where did you get me from?"" ""I just started typing in Yahoo and Google different articles -- anything that pulled up in 1987 with any child that went missing -- and I came across the article, and the baby picture just struck me because ... it looked like my daughter,"" White, now the mother of a 5-year-old girl, told the Post. ""I swear I stayed on that article for like a good two hours."" On January 4, Joy White's phone rang. The woman on the other end of the line said she was Carlina, and she sent White a picture taken in 1987. The face in the photograph bore a striking resemblance to that of the baby in the tattered picture White had held on to. Police also agreed that the photographs looked alike and carried out a DNA test. On Tuesday, the results came back: They were a match. Lisa White-Heatley, Joy White's sister, was at the reunion between Carlina and her mother. ""It was a beautiful experience,"" she said Friday on NBC's ""Today"" show. ""Her face -- she looked just like herself. I just grabbed her. I was so happy to see her. And then my sister started to cry and Carlina said, 'Mommy, don't cry.'"" Regina Tyson, the sister of Carlina White's biological father, described her niece's relationship with her family as ""immediate closeness."" ""This was always what I wanted ever since I found out that lady wasn't my biological mother,"" Carlina White told the Post of her newly reunited family. ""I just hope that the officials will be able to get her in their hands so we could just hear her side of the story now."" Her biological family, meanwhile, says they want justice. ""I want her to go to jail ... for what she did and what she did to my family,"" White-Heatley said of whoever abducted her niece. ""She destroyed my family."" CNN's Ronni Berke contributed to this report.","NEW: North Carolina authorities have issued a warrant to arrest Ann Pettway .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard says it has linked six bogus Mayday calls for help in Maryland to the same person, and officials are now asking the public for help finding the suspect. Investigators have determined the calls, which began in May and abruptly ended June 1, came from an area near Little River, Maryland, a small town near Baltimore on the northern tip of the Chesapeake Bay. ""We received two quick 'Mayday, Mayday' calls each time and when we would engage him he would go silent and say nothing else,"" said the Coast Guard's Jonathan Lindberg. The Coast Guard delayed alerting the public until it was certain the same person was responsible for the phony cries for help, Lindberg said. ""Making false distress calls limits the Coast Guard and our rescue partners' capabilities to assist those boaters that are in actual emergency situations,"" said Capt. Kevin Kiefer, commander of Sector Baltimore. ""Hoax radio calls also place first responders in unnecessary danger as they work to assist the boating public,"" Kiefer added in a statement. Dealing with fake distress calls is a chronic problem for the Coast Guard, and the cases prove hard to solve. Tracing radio calls is an imperfect science, and authorities lean heavily on the public for information. In June, a false distress call of a yacht explosion prompted a massive rescue effort off the coast of New Jersey and garnered attention nationwide. As part of the New Jersey investigation, authorities released an audio excerpt from the fake call. On the recording, a male voice is heard saying, ""We have 21 souls on board, 20 in the water right now. I have three deceased on board, nine injured because of the explosion we've had. I'm in 3 feet of water on the bridge. I'm going to stay by the radio as long as I can before I have to go overboard."" Investigators found no evidence of people, a boat or even debris, the U.S. Coast Guard said, but the hunt for the suspect continues. ""It's still an active investigation,"" Charles Rowe of the USCG's New York office told CNN Thursday. The burden of paying for unneeded search and rescue operations is passed on to taxpayers, and the costs can be massive. ""This guy is spending your money when he's doing this,"" Rowe said. The estimated price of the rescue operation in the New Jersey was $300,000, and the Maryland case is already nearing $70,000. ""It's dangerous to the boating public, anybody who gets on a boat, and it's dangerous to first responders,"" according to Rowe. The USCG's New York office told CNN they've received a steady stream of spurious calls this summer, but nothing out of the ordinary, and none they can trace back to the New Jersey incident. Making a false distress call is a felony with the maximum penalty of six years in prison, a $5,000 civil fine and a $250,000 criminal fine. Anyone with information is asked to call the Coast Guard's Investigative Services team.","U.S. Coast Guard says 6 bogus Mayday calls linked to the same person in Maryland .

"(CNN) -- A day after a gunman opened fire at an Arizona supermarket, authorities released the emergency calls. The recordings, which were made public by the Pima County Sheriff's Office on Sunday, paint a patchy picture of the scene just moments after the shooting that killed six people and wounded 14, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Callers spoke with remarkable clarity given the chaos around them. Screams can be heard in the background as one male caller calmly tells another man, ""We got help coming."" The following information has been edited for brevity and to protect the names of the callers. Not all calls are included. 911: 911, where is your emergency? Caller 1: Mrs. Giffords! 911: Hello? Hello? Caller 1: Oh, 911. There was a shooting at Safeway ... where Gabrielle Giffords was. And I do believe Gabrielle Giffords was hit. 911: At Safeway, sir? Caller 1: Yeah, Safeway. 911: Was somebody shot then sir? Caller 1: Yes, it looked like the guy had a semiautomatic pistol and he went in. He just started firing. And then he ran. 911: Which way did he run? Caller 1: He ran north past the Walgreens that's right next to the Safeway. 911: Can you describe him? Caller 1: He was wearing a hoodie. 911: What color was the hoodie? Caller 1: It was black. 911: What color were his pants? Caller 1: It looked like he was wearing blue jeans. And he was wearing a black sweater. 911: Is anybody injured? Did you say Gabrielle Giffords was hit? Caller 1: She's hit. I do believe she's breathing. She was breathing. She still has a pulse ... And we got one dead. 911: And there's other people that are injured? Caller 1: There was multiple people shot. 911: Oh my God. 911: 911, are you reporting a shooting? Caller 2: Yes, I am. 911: OK, did you witness anything? Caller 2: Yes I did. 911: What did you witness ma'am? Caller 2: I witnessed ... gunshot and then I tried to duck down. I see the man that was caught shooting was held down by some other people. They took away his gun and they're holding him down so he can't do anything else. 911: OK, we do have deputies on the way. They'll be there shortly. I need you to stay out of the way where you're at right now and try to get anyone else to safety without getting yourself in any harm, OK? Caller 2: OK, yeah.

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI delivered his final Angelus prayer to a crowd of thousands gathered at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City on Sunday, as he prepares to retire. Here is the full text of his sermon: . Dear brothers and sisters. During the service on the second Lent Sunday, the Gospel of the Transfiguration of the Lord is always presented. Luke, the evangelist, has highlighted the fact that Jesus transfigured while he prayed. His is a deep, profound experience of relationship with the Father during a sort of spiritual retreat that Jesus lives on a high mount accompanied by Peter, James and John, the three disciples who were always present during the moments of the divine manifestation of the Master. The Lord, who not long ago had proclaimed his death and resurrection, offers the disciples an anticipation of his glory. Read more: Pope leads last Angelus prayer . And in both the transfiguration and the baptism, the voice of the heavenly Father echoes: ""This is my son, the chosen one, listen to him!"" The presence of Moses and Elias later on, representing the laws and the prophets of the ancient covenant, is far more important: All the story of the covenant is oriented towards Him, the Christ, who fulfills a new exodus not towards the promised land as during the times of Moses but towards Heaven. St. Peter's intervention: ""Master, it is beautiful for us to be here"" represents the impossible attempt to stop such mystical experience. St. Augustine has commented: ""St. Peter... on the Mount... Christ's only food was the soul. Because he must have descended to return to exhaustion and pain, while above, he was filled with feelings of sacred love towards God, which thus inspired him to a sacred path."" Pondering over this fragment of the Gospel, we can draw a very important lesson: First of all, the supremacy of prayer, without which all the apostolate endeavors, and that of charity, will be reduced to activism. During Lent, let us learn to give the right time to prayer, both personal and community prayer, which breathes air into our spiritual life. Read more: Vatican denies swirling rumors . However, praying does not mean isolating oneself from the world and its contradictions, as St. Peter would have liked to have done on Mount Tabor, but prayer leads us back to the path, to action. Christian existence -- I have written in the Message for this Lent -- means to continuously climb up the mount for our encounter with God, so that afterward we can descend again filled with his love and strength to serve our brothers and sisters with the very love of God. Dear Brothers and sisters, this Word of God I feel in a particular way towards me, at this moment in my life. The Lord is calling me to ""climb the mount,"" and to devote myself to meditation, reflection and prayer. However, this does not mean abandoning the Church, but rather, if God has requested this of me, it is so that I can continue to serve the Church with the same dedication and the same love with which I have done up until now, but in a way adapted to my age and my strength. Let us invoke Virgin Mary's intercession: Let her guide all of you to follow the Lord Jesus always, in prayer as well as in laborious charity.","Pope Benedict XVI delivered his final Angelus prayer and blessing Sunday .
He will step down as pontiff on Thursday, retire into a life of meditation and prayer .
Benedict insists his departure from the papacy ""does not mean abandoning the Church""
Instead he says he will continue to serve ""in a way adapted to my age and my strength"""
"(CNN) -- It wasn't supposed to happen. America's youth were supposed to be apathetic and disheartened. We weren't supposed to be at the polls. The word was that we had fallen out of love with President Obama, the man who inspired us four years ago. Big money would silence our voices and make our efforts inconsequential. Two-thousand-twelve would be nothing like 2008; the youth vote wouldn't be the decisive force it was four years ago. We saw it differently. In two consecutive elections, more than half of my generation voted: It is clear now, if it wasn't before, that we recognize our responsibility to our country. In fact, this time we made up an even larger percentage (19%) of the electorate than we did four years ago (18%). Opinion roundup: Where Obama, and America, go from here . We still support the man who has stood up for us: Sixty percent of voters age 18-29 chose President Obama on Tuesday. I don't think any young person was surprised, however, that older Americans had no idea what we were thinking. My generation has been burdened by a misguided war that damaged our credibility abroad. We've been told the national debt is so large that we'll never be able to pay it back. We have experienced an economic crisis unlike any since the Great Depression. We have watched our environment head toward disaster and our government stand at an impasse. We have been told over and over that America is no longer the great country it once was. But our participation in the election and our overwhelming support for the president are indicative of our hope for the future and our compulsion to start tackling these problems now. Opinion: Women gain wider access to power . We don't support the president just because he's ""cool,"" plays basketball or listens to Jay-Z. Instead, we recognize that he, too, is ready to meet these great challenges. And we want to help him build a stronger, safer, more just America. This election also revealed that my generation has moved past many of the debates of our parents and grandparents: The youth vote was imperative to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Maine and Maryland, the rejection of constitutional discrimination in Minnesota and the election of a president who supports equal pay, reproductive rights and fair immigration reform. For us, these issues are a matter of common sense. We may have been disenchanted with politics over the past few years, but this election proves that it's not because we don't care. Rather, we reject petty posturing, partisan gridlock and inaction. Voting is great, but it's not an accomplishment. It's a responsibility. We recognize that going to the polls is the easiest thing we are going to have to do. In August, I wrote that in this election, young people would display a deep commitment to our country and its ideals, and provide a preview of the America we intend to build. We accomplished the first two, and that gives me hope that we will succeed in building a future of which we can be proud. The next time someone claims that my generation doesn't care and won't help, remind them that we showed up, voted for change and are ready to get to work.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jack Schlossberg.","Jack Schlossberg: Young voters were said to lack enthusiasm and to be unlikely to vote .

"(CNN) -- It has been more than a year since the United States government withdrew its ambassador to Syria and closed its embassy in Damascus. On Thursday, that ambassador returned to the region along with a U.S. delegation, touring a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey to bring more attention to the growing humanitarian crisis. As the civil war has intensified in Syria, hundreds of thousands of people have sought refuge in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and other neighboring countries. Ambassador Robert Ford gave an exclusive interview to CNN's Ivan Watson and described what the U.S. is doing to help the refugees and the Syrian opposition. Ivan Watson: The U.S. has given $210 million in aid (to Syria), but I think that there is a perception problem because no one can actually point at what that help is. So people conclude there is no help. Robert Ford: The assistance is going in. It's things like tents, it's things like blankets, it's things like medical equipment, but it doesn't come in big boxes with an American flag on it because we don't want the people who are delivering it to be targeted by the Syrian regime. The regime is going after and killing people who are delivering supplies. You see them bombing even bakeries and bread lines. So we're doing that, in part, to be discrete. The needs are gigantic. So even though a great deal of American materials and other countries' materials are arriving, the needs are still greater. And that's why we're going to Kuwait to talk to the United Nations and to talk to other countries about how we can talk together to provide additional assistance. Watson: The head of the Syrian National Coalition, which the U.S. government has backed, came out with a statement very critical of the international community, saying we need $3 billion if you want us to have any say on events on the ground inside Syria. Where is that money? Ford: (Sheikh Ahmed) Moaz al-Khatib is a good leader, and we think highly of him and we have recognized his (coalition) as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. And, of course, he wants to get as many resources as possible because of the humanitarian conditions that I was just talking about. Especially the ones inside Syria. But we also, at the same time, have to build up those (aid) networks I was talking about. In some cases, they start out with just a few people. We don't need just a few people, we need hundreds of people, thousands of people on the inside of Syria organized to bring these things in. And so step by step, the Syrians, Moaz al-Khatib and his organization, need to build that capacity. We can help build it, we can do training and things like that. But in the end, Syrians have to take a leadership role in this. Watson: Is Washington giving money to the Syrian National Coalition? Ford: We absolutely are assisting the (coalition), with everything from training to, in some cases, limited amount of cash assistance so that they can buy everything ranging from computers to telephones to radios. Frankly, if not for the American assistance in many cases, the activists inside Syria wouldn't be in contact with the outside world. It's American help that keeps them in contact with the outside world. Watson: But, how much assistance has this coalition gotten from the U.S.? Ford: So far, we've allocated directly to the coalition in the neighborhood of $35 million worth of different kinds of equipment and assistance. And over the next few weeks, couple of months, we'll probably provide another $15 million worth of material assistance. Watson: Washington recently blacklisted Jabhat al-Nusra, the Nusra Front, calling it a terrorist organization even though inside Syria, it has attracted a lot of respect for its victories and for comparative lack of corruption compared to many rebel groups. How has blacklisting the Nusra Front helped the Syrian opposition? Ford: We blacklisted the Nusra Front because of its intimate links with al Qaeda in Iraq, an organization with whom we have direct experience, which is responsible for the killings of thousands of Iraqis, hundreds of Americans. We know what al Qaeda in Iraq did and is still doing, and we don't want it to start doing that in Syria -- which is why we highlighted its incredibly pernicious role. I think one of the things that our classification of Nusra as a terrorist group did is it set off an alarm for the other elements of the Free Syrian Army. There was a meeting of the Free Syrian Army to set up a unified command, (and) Nusra Front was not in that meeting -- which we think is the right thing to do. As Syrians themselves understand that Nusra has a sectarian agenda, as they understand better that Nusra is anti-democratic and will seek to impose its very strict interpretation of Islam on Syria -- which historically is a relatively moderate country in terms of its religious practices -- as Syrians understand that better, I think they will more and more reject the Nusra Front itself. Watson: But I've seen the opposite. As I go into Syria, I hear more and more support and respect for the Nusra Front, and more and more criticism for the U.S. government each time I go back. Ford: I think that people, Ivan, are still understanding what Nusra is. I have heard criticism from the Nusra Front from people like Moaz al-Khatib who, in Marrakesh (Morocco) in his speech, said he rejected the kind of ideology which backs up Nusra. ... We have heard that from the senior commander of the Free Syrian Army as well. And so the more people understand inside Syria what Nusra is and represents, I think they will agree that is not the group on which to depend for freedom in Syria. Watson: Do you think the U.S. government could have done more? Ford: I think the Syrians, as I said, are the ones who will bring the answer to the problem -- just as in Iraq, Iraqis brought the solution to the Iraq crisis, to the Iraq war. The Americans can help, and we helped in Iraq, but ultimately it wasn't the Americans. Despite our help, it was Iraqis. In Syria, again, it has to be Syrians who find their way forward. Twenty-three million Syrians need to find their way forward. We can help, and we are helping: $210 million in humanitarian assistance, $50 million to help the political opposition get organized for the day after (Bashar) al-Assad goes. These are important bits of help. But ultimately, it's not the American help. It's the Syrians themselves.","The U.S. ambassador to Syria says the U.S. has provided $210 million in humanitarian aid .
The assistance has to be discrete, he said, to protect workers from being targeted .
Washington has also provided $35 million worth of assistance to Syria's political opposition .

"Washington (CNN) -- Unlike most issues these days that divide along party lines, the immediate fate of President Obama's new gun proposals will depend not as much on Republicans as his fellow Democrats in the Senate. Senate Democratic leadership sources tell CNN that passing any new legislation will be extremely difficult because more than a dozen vulnerable Democrats from conservative states will probably resist much of what the president is pushing. These Democratic sources say the most likely legislation to pass will be strengthening background checks, since it is the least overt form of gun control and it also appeals to gun rights advocates' emphasis on keeping guns away from people with mental health and criminal problems. Obama announces 23 executive actions, asks Congress to pass gun laws . Although Senate Democrats like Dianne Feinstein will still make a high-profile push to renew the assault weapons ban and limit ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, senior Democratic sources say it is hard to see those measures getting enough support to pass the Democratic-led Senate. The focus is on the Senate because Senate Democratic leaders know that House Republicans will not act on anything until the Senate does. Democratic leadership sources say they intend to spend next week -- the first week the Senate is in session -- canvassing red-state Democrats to see what, if anything, is doable. Democratic senators who advocate various gun control measures will be lobbying their colleagues as well. See details of president's proposals . At a certain point, Democratic leaders will decide the best course of action, if any. Democratic leadership sources emphasize what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a PBS interview in recent days: They will not vote on any legislation unless they have 60 votes, enough to break a filibuster. Democratic leadership sources say they have no intention of putting their members in a politically vulnerable position on a gun measure unless they are sure it can reach the president's desk. In the short term, that would mean not only getting red-state Democrats on board, but at least a handful of Senate Republicans as well. There is some hope that Democrats may be able to persuade GOP Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, a moderate, to help shape bipartisan legislation that can pass.","Vulnerable Democrats from conservative states might resist much of what president wants .

"(CNN) -- For Alex Zanardi, losing both legs in a life-threatening crash was only the beginning of a new chapter. This year, the Italian racing driver, who has competed in Formula One and Indycar series, added two Paralympic gold medals and a win in the New York marathon's handcycle division to his career highlights. Reflecting on what lies next, he says: ""I have to tell you that the possibilities are not lacking in my life, and this is something for which I feel very lucky."" At school, Zanardi didn't compete in sports much, ""because I was really fat as a kid."" After his sister was killed in a car crash his parents were eager to keep him off the road -- but they did allow Zanardi to race go-karts. ""I clearly remember that first day on the go-kart being the best in my life,"" he says. Zanardi first raced in Formula One in 1992. After a contract with Lotus ended, he switched to Indycar racing, ultimately winning two championships. In America he became a popular driver, making a signature move out of performing post-race donuts on the track, and earning the nickname Latka (a reference to a character in '80s sitcom ""Taxi""). The crash . In 2001, Zanardi was leading in a Champ car race at Lausitzring in Germany, with 13 laps to go. But as he emerged from a final pit-stop, something went wrong. ""I lost control of the car in the acceleration lane, spun around and basically ended up ... a sitting duck in the middle of the racing line."" Zanardi awaited his fate as his fellow drivers sped by at more than 350mph. Struck by the second car to pass, his car -- and his body -- were effectively sliced in two. The blood loss was massive. ""It was like having the sink opened,"" he says. ""Both arteries were completely ripped apart; the amputation was immediate."" As a racecar driver, he'd had plenty of opportunity to ponder how he would react to such a fate. ""I said I would probably kill myself,"" Zanardi says. ""Then I found myself in this situation and that thought never went through my mind."" ""I had a clear perception that I had cheated death. I was very happy, and full of joy at being alive."" Friends and family worried about how he would manage to get by without legs. But Zanardi says the question he asked himself on emerging from a coma was ""not that much different in the wording, but technically very different."" It was: ""My question was, how the hell am I going to do all the things I have to do with no legs?"" His attitude was one of ""pure curiosity."" ""I knew I was going to find a way to overcome my problems,"" he adds. More from Human to Hero: From builder to Pritzker-winning architect . Being a professional athlete served Zanardi well during his rehabilitation -- he already knew that it simply takes persistence to achieve a good result. ""Having been involved in sport a long time made me learn that you cannot magically make things happen overnight. You can only do what you can each day, and take the next day to add to what you have done the previous day."" ""The method which allowed me to get out of my troubles was setting a list of priorities, as I did previously in sport, preparing a race."" ""My first goal was to try to get out of that bed, and then to get rid of all those tubes and wires that were keeping me alive. Then go on the toilet on my own and then, step-by-step -- very metaphorical in my case -- slowly, I got to the point of thinking about rehabilitation over a pair of prosthetic legs."" The comeback . Within a year, he had crossed all of those problems off his list. Two years later, Zanardi returned to Lausitzring to complete his 13 laps, averaging nearly 200mph in a hand-operated car. Three years later, he was contracted to race for BMW in the European Touring Car Championships. Four years later, he won a World Touring Car Championship race, using his hip to work a modified brake pedal attached to a prosthetic leg, an accelerating device mounted under the steering wheel, and a clutch mechanism worked by hand. He celebrated by doing donuts on the track. Five years later, he was back in a modified BMW Formula One car, steering with one hand and accelerating with the other. He was again subject to the same dangers, but says ""life itself is that way."" ""The simple fact that we are alive and breathe means we have something to lose. In this philosophical way, I found it absolutely normal to jump back in the car and do things as I did before. ""I knew that if there was a way to connect my brain to the racing car, I would be the same driver as before."" If anything, he says, he is now less vulnerable than before: ""If I break one of my legs, it only takes a 4mm screw to fix it."" More from Human to Hero: Opera singers are athletes . Handcycling . It was an invitation to speak at the 2007 New York marathon that first inspired Zanardi to try handcycling. ""I thought, since I'm there, I may as well do the marathon,"" he says. With only a month's preparation, he finished fourth in his division, discovering that, not only was handcycling a great way to keep fit, but it also allowed him to apply his knowledge of aerodynamics. By 2009, he had a new goal in his sights -- the London 2012 Paralympic Games. As well as physical training to prepare, Zanardi spent hours working as his own race engineer, fine-tuning his cycle until it perfectly complemented his body. ""Every athlete has different needs, because every athlete has different residual abilities ... you have to modify in order to find the perfect machine for you."" Just as a racecar driver must interpret what the instruments on his dashboard reveal, Zanardi says he also had to learn to interpret his own body's inputs and outputs. ""There's nothing you can do about power in a racing car, other than telling your engineers your engine doesn't sound or feel as good as it should ... here, I'm the engine. I need to be aware of what's going on ... "" A year after winning the handcycling division of the New York Marathon -- completing the race in one hour, 13 minutes and 58 seconds -- Zanardi won golds in both the H4 men's road and time trial races at the Paralympics. Victory was sweet, but being a paralympian was also fulfilling because, Zanardi says, ""finally, I saw people realizing what kind of message can come out of sport in general."" ""You are surprised by the result they're achieving, but you can't help but think, the starting point for these guys was much further back than yours.""","Italian racecar driver Alex Zanardi lost his legs in an Indycar crash in 2001 .

"(CNN) -- For Brazil's football team, the pressure is on. Next year the FIFA World Cup arrives in the South American country for only the second time, with the nation's near 200 million inhabitants expecting to celebrate a record sixth triumph in the tournament. But all is not well in the land of ""jogo bonito"" -- the beautiful game. So much so that with Brazil falling to an all-time low of 18th in the world rankings, a couple of old stagers are back to try and breathe new life into a nation that in many ways represents the very essence of international football. Luis Felipe Scolari, the coach of Brazil's 2002 World Cup winners, has been drafted in to replace Mano Manezes. And one of Scolari's first actions was to recall a hero of the triumphant campaign in Japan and South Korea 11 years ago. Against England in Wednesday's Wembley friendly, Ronaldinho, a two-time World Player of the Year, was back in the famous gold shirt for the first time in over a year as he looked to enhance his chances of making the squad for 2014. 'Craque' But the plan failed. Scolari, Ronaldinho and co. slipped to a 2-1 defeat, with England playing more of the slick, attacking football Brazil has made its trademark. For Ronaldinho, now plying his trade with Atletico Miniero in his homeland after dazzling for Barcelona between 2003 and 2008, it was a miserable evening. Off the ball, his laid back, border-line lazy approach was as recognizable as the beaming grim beneath his abundant curly locks. But in possession, the bursts of acceleration which helped him become the world's most feared player during his halcyon days with Barca were less apparent. His killer instinct in front of goal also seemed to have deserted him. When his 19th-minute penalty was saved by England goalkeeper Joe Hart, suspicions grew that the 87,000 plus spectators inside the stadium were watching a ghost. After 45 minutes Scolari had also seen enough and Ronaldinho did not emerge for the second half. ""He's very important, he's a 'craque',"" Brazil and Chelsea midfielder Ramires said after the game, using a term which refers to a technically gifted player. ""We all know about his great quality ... we all know how important he is and we just hope he's OK physically,"" added Ramires. Despite a low key performance which saw Ronaldinho out ran and out thought by England's midfield trio of Jack Wilshere, Tom Cleverley and Steven Gerrard, Brazil captain David Luiz also hailed the qualities of the 32-year-old. ""It's a privilege to play with him,"" said the Chelsea defender. ""No doubt about it. Not only for his football, but also for the person he is. ""You saw when Ronaldinho came on the screen, everyone was raving and that just shows how big he is in world football."" As well as past stars like Ronaldinho, it was also a tough test for the emerging crop of Brazilian superstars. Oscar, the third of Chelsea's Brazilian trio, Paris-Saint Germain's Lucas Moura and playmaker Paulinho of Club World Cup winners Corinthians all struggled to live up to their lofty billing. Mohican-clad attacker . But most worrying of all was the performance of Neymar. If Ronaldinho is yesterday's hero, the Santos schemer has long had the billing of today's A Selecao shining star. Yet the Mohican-clad attacker was subdued throughout - as he had been in Brazil's Olympic final defeat by Mexico in August at Wembley -- struggling to shake off the stubborn defensive work of England right back Glen Johnson. So if Brazil are to lift the World Cup next year, the player widely regarded as the third best in the world behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will have to lift his game considerably. ""It did not go as I had expected or wanted,"" the 21-year-old Neymar told reporters. ""I would have liked to help the team more, but today was not my day. Next time."" Wednesday's defeat might stir memories of the last time Brazil hosted the World Cup in 1950. Needing just a draw to be crowned world champions in the final game of the tournament, Brazil lost 2-1 to Uruguay and missed out on a first World Cup triumph -- an event referred to by playwright Nelson Rodrigues as ""our Hiroshima"". That loss scarred Brazilian society -- a similar failure next year is unimaginable. ""Our chances of winning the World Cup are big,"" said Brazil's Bayern Munich defender Dante. ""That's our mentality, that's what we are focused on. In our heads we can't go there and think if we finish second or third that's enough. ""The fans will be very important. You can expect every game to be 60,000, 70,000 people together with us, and we are going to use their emotion to make us stronger on the pitch. ""We have great players who are used to pressure and our motivation is really high."" Ramires was is similarly defiant mood. ""We are going to be ready,"" said Chelsea midfielder. ""We are going in to win the World Cup.""","Brazil lose 2-1 to England at Wembley Stadium, London .

"(CNN) -- Legendary rock band Heart received the 2,481st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday. Founding members Ann and Nancy Wilson unveiled the terrazzo tile in front of an excited crowd that included their children, members of Alice in Chains, and actress-singer Rita Wilson, who recalled driving down Mulholland Drive during the '70s in -- you guessed it -- her parent's Barracuda. ""When I was a teenager in Hollywood,"" Wilson said, ""I became aware of a powerful rock band that was fronted by two women, two sisters, two chicks who rocked the house."" Ann and Nancy Wilson busted the rock 'n' roll boys club wide open in 1976 when they released their debut disc, ""Dreamboat Annie."" The album included singles ""Magic Man"" and ""Crazy on You."" It showcased Ann's powerful vocals and her younger sister's prodigious guitar skills. Heart's second record, ""Little Queen,"" produced the anthem ""Barracuda,"" which has been the group's signature song since 1977. In a testosterone-fueled genre, the Wilson sisters proved two women could front their own rock band, play their own instruments and write their own music. ""We never considered the gender aspect of it when we first started,"" Ann told CNN after the ceremony. ""We just thought, 'Why can't we?'"" ""It was just sort of being, not girlfriends of the Beatles, or wives of the Beatles -- we wanted to BE the Beatles,"" said Nancy. But breaking down barriers wasn't easy, Nancy said, noting, ""Being taken seriously was always the biggest challenge."" The two sisters also gave a shout-out to their children, thanking them for their patience as Heart toured the world. ""The guilt!"" exclaimed Ann. ""We're moms!"" ""When we're home we like to cook, and be together and do mom things when we can,"" Nancy explained. ""But we're the CEOs of the Heart corporation. Our job causes us to travel like a lot of CEO-type women, so they've been really beautiful about being proud of us and being there for us."" Heart is currently in the midst of a North American tour that will hit more than 50 cities by the time it wraps up in mid-November.

"New York (CNN) -- The Long Island Power Authority said Tuesday its customers -- many of them in areas hard-hit by Superstorm Sandy -- can wait for the next meter-reading cycle to pay their power bills. Customers also can make a partial payment reflecting what they think is appropriate, and then wait for the exact reading to pay the difference, LIPA spokeswoman Elizabeth Flagler said. The announcement came after outraged customers questioned why they were receiving electricity bills post-Sandy that reflected a full month's use of electricity, even though many were without power for days or weeks. The utility had said Monday that it was sending out bills based on customers' estimated usage of the same month last year, because it had reassigned its meter readers to help with power restoration efforts after Sandy. ""(The) next actual meter reading will reflect the amount of electricity (customers) have used since (their) previous actual meter reading, and it will automatically adjust ... charges,"" Flagler told CNN on Monday. Opinion: Let's not forget Superstorm Sandy's victims . But LIPA customers such as Jonathan Saporta complained about receiving typical bills for electricity use during a month that was anything but typical. ""At this point, with a major disaster, with so many people losing so much of their livelihood, they can't go around to do estimated billing and hold all that money,"" Saporta said. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . Flagler said that, in addition to delaying payment without late penalty or making a partial payment, customers can do the digital meter readings themselves and call it in to customer service to get a new bill that will be regenerated in two weeks. She did mention, however, that conducting the reading was difficult and that there is an educational video on LIPA's website to address how to do it. Saporta said Monday he was having trouble getting in contact with LIPA, period. ""I can't even get them to acknowledge my existence on Earth rather than address what is what,"" he said. ""Until I get some sort of clarification on what is owed and what is going to be done, I am going to continue ignoring them,"" Saporta said. LIPA has been widely criticized for its communication with customers in weeks after Sandy. In the midst of complaints LIPA's Chief Operating Officer Michael Hervey resigned earlier this month and Bruce Germano, the vice president of customer service, announced Monday that he will leave the utility at the end of the year. X. Cristofer Damianos, who served on the LIPA board, also stepped down, LIPA spokeswoman Flagler said. Flagler said the estimated billing this month was a direct response to Sandy, and not the way LIPA typical bills. ""All LIPA and national grid employees were reassigned to support elsewhere in efforts to restore power. That's why the bills have been estimated,"" she said. NJ governor puts Sandy damage at $29.4 billion . ""It's not the first time bills have been estimated. They were estimated last year after (Hurricane) Irene,"" Flagler added.

"London (CNN) -- So Brand Beckham now moves to the next generation. One of the Beckham juniors, 10-year-old Romeo, is appearing in the Burberry Spring 2013 campaign. He's in a raincoat, of course, featuring in the brand's typical threads. Burberry has lately been putting non-models in their campaigns, using well-known British people to underscore the that Brand Burberry is British. Emma Watson, of Harry Potter fame, had the spotlight in 2011. Romeo is a clever hook. Did Beckham project succeed in U.S.? He already is one of the most photographed children in the world. His parents have not shied away from showing the boys off at Lakers' basketball games, or just walking through airports. Just last week they were in front of a West End theater for the launch of the Spice Girls musical (no comment). So two British brands now merge, though I suspect it has more to do with Asia than London. More: L.A. Galaxy wins again in Beckham's last U.S. game . David Beckham is of course a global icon, just like Burberry. China is the main thrust for Burberry as it continues to upgrade its image and its stores and its prices to be a bigger luxury brand ---most others remain niche. Burberry stores are getting bigger while the company continues to buy out former joint venture partners in order to take full control of the brand in every country in which it operates. It was interesting a few months ago when Burberry lowered expectations for 2012 on the back of a slowdown in China and the shares dropped like a stone. So, having a recognizable face (or at least a recognizable name) in Asia should be a plus, come spring. End it like Beckham . Not least because Burberry does children's clothing. I can remember interviewing Christopher Bailey, the creative director, a few years ago at Burberry's new headquarters. We walked through the children's section and that's when I realized they dressed well-off children as well. I had no idea (none of my three have worn a stitch of Burberry). So, Romeo hits the nail on the head in multiple ways. Hasn't Burberry come a long way? A decade ago the Burberry check pattern was used by teenagers (and I'm told some soccer hooligans) as a ""chav"" look, a trend where people who could not afford a label would wear a knock-off version. Burberry fought back, cracking down on knock-offs while moving the brand even more upscale. Largely it's worked. Like Mini or Jaguar, Burberry has been reborn but remains proudly British. Looks like Brand Beckham is doing the same.","David Beckham's son Romeo, 10, stars in Burberry's 2013 Spring campaign .

"(CNN) -- In an effort to stem gun violence across the United States, President Barack Obama on Wednesday signed 23 executive actions, which don't require congressional approval -- some of which called for tougher enforcement of existing laws and required federal agencies to provide data for background checks. He also proposed background checks on all future gun sales, as recommended by a task force led by Vice President Joe Biden. But Congress would have to approve that policy. The term ""universal background checks,"" used by some gun control supporters, is code for closing federal loopholes so that such checks will be conducted at gun shows and other private sales. U.S. law requires background checks for all people who try to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. But federal law does not require background checks for ""private transactions,"" such as sales at gun shows. Many states have their own statutes requiring such checks for private sales. Across the country, more than 1 million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures. That figure, however, is a small fraction of overall gun sales. The issue has risen high in the national conversation after the shock ignited by December's mass shooting of six adults and 20 children at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Expanded background checks now enjoy the support of mayors in some of the largest cities in America. The idea has been embraced by gun violence survivor Gabrielle Giffords, a self-described gun owner. ""This may be the single most important gun violence prevention measure that the government could adopt,"" said Lindsay Nichols, an attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""This loophole means that dangerous criminals and dangerously mentally ill individuals have a most unfettered access to firearms."" But National Rifle Association President David Keene suggested to CNN's Candy Crowley that he has little faith in universal background checks, saying they don't work. Keene spoke a few days after sitting in on the Biden task force. He implied that the task force wasn't sincerely considering NRA positions on gun control issues, saying they were simply ""checking the box. They were able to say, 'We've met with the NRA. We've met with the people that are strong Second Amendment supporters.' "" The NRA reiterated that concern on Wednesday after the president held a news conference and signed the executive action. The group touted its ""efforts to promote safety and responsible gun ownership,"" and its ""focus on keeping our children safe and securing our schools, fixing our broken mental health system, and prosecuting violent criminals to the fullest extent of the law."" But it also took a thinly veiled swipe at the president's moves. ""Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation. Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy,"" the NRA said. What part of universal background checks does NRA support? Keene did say he favored background checks to block people who may be mentally ill or potentially violent from buying guns. But federal law already requires that, Nichols said. Details of the president's proposals . One problem with the systems is that many states don't report the names of people who've been legally labeled dangerously mentally ill. Improving the accuracy and availability of information about these people, Keene said, is one possible area for agreement. He suggested ""tightening up on putting information in the database. It's school security. It's beefing up the way we deal with the mentally ill."" Nichols said ""huge gaps"" exist in the database, which is called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. For example, the Virginia Tech shooter, who killed 33 people and himself in 2007, had passed two background checks because Virginia didn't submit his mentally ill status to the database, Nichols said. ""As a result of that shooting, the federal government passed a law encouraging these states to submit these records, and a large number of states passed laws. So there's been significant improvement in reporting dangerously mentally ill persons to NICS,"" Nichols said. ""But there are still about half of the states that report hardly any dangerously mentally ill people. They may not have the resources or the political will to enforce the law. Yeah, it's crazy."" How do background checks now work? Anytime someone buys a gun from a federally licensed gun dealer, the dealer is required to run a check on the buyer by submitting the name to the federal database. That database consists of criminal records and mental health records as provided by federal and state courts and agencies. Convicted felons, people convicted of violent domestic crimes, and those determined by the courts to be dangerously mentally ill are prohibited by federal law from buying firearms, Nichols said. Also, states have added their own categories of who is prohibited from buying a gun, Nichols said. For example, California prohibits gun ownership for people convicted of any kind of violent crime, drug offenses, alcohol abuse and juvenile offenses while underage, Nichols said. Vermont is the only state without such laws, Nichols said. Just how many gun purchases don't require federal background checks, and how does that happen? Forty percent of all firearms purchased in the United States are sold without background checks because the guns aren't purchased from a federally licensed firearms dealer, Nichols said. Rather, those weapons are bought at gun shows, on street corners, over the Internet or from friends or neighbors, Nichols said. These are the so-called loopholes in the current federal background check system. The NRA disputes that characterization about the ""gun show loophole"" because federally licensed firearms dealers participate at gatherings and, of course, conduct background checks. ""Most of the guns that are purchased at a gun show are purchased from federal firearms-licensed holders,"" Keene said. He challenged the 40% figure for gun sales without background checks -- particularly at gun shows. ""We don't know what (is the) percentage at gun shows. It may be 10%,"" Keene said. ""It's not such a loophole at gun shows. But it's like if you sell me your shotgun, that's a private transaction. Just as if I sell you a car, I don't have a dealer's license."" Ten states and the District of Columbia have their own laws requiring background checks for any firearm sold at a gun show, Nichols said. Six more states require background checks for gun-show sales of handguns, but not for rifles or shotguns, Nichols said. In total, 16 states and the District of Columbia require background checks on handguns sold at gun shows, Nichols said. These states that close loopholes, however, provide exemptions for gun transfers between immediate family members and between licensed dealers, Nichols said. Are background checks effective? From the time when the gun control measures of the Brady Act were enacted on March 1, 1994, through the end of 2008, the federal government processed more than 97 million applications for gun transfers or permits, the Justice Department says. Almost 1.8 million applications were denied, the agency said. On this matter, both sides are in agreement. Said Keene: ""Background checks are generally a good thing."" Added Nichols: ""Background checks have a huge deterrent effect. People who are ineligible to buy a gun are unlikely to try if they know they are going to be subjected to a background check."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report from Washington and Mark Morgenstein updated this report from Atlanta.","President proposes ""universal background checks"" on all gun sales .

"BUCHAREST, Romania (Reuters)  -- In the mobile phone version of the ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" video game, the torches hanging along the dark walls of Hogwarts glow in an eerily realistic fashion. Romania is known for its strong computing and language skills coupled with cheap labor. ""We invented the technology, it's called 'dynamic lighting',"" said Mihai Pohontu, general manager of Romania's mobile phone branch of Electronic Arts Inc, the world's biggest video game publisher. Romanian programmers, such as Pohontu's team, are among the most sought-after in the world as large international IT companies turn to the east European country to take advantage of strong computing and language skills coupled with cheap labor. Its computer literacy is not without its dark side -- the country has an unenviable reputation as a hotbed for computer fraud and a large community of hackers. But legitimate IT is one of Romania's fastest growing export sectors with turnover of about 1 billion euros ($1.38 billion). Roughly 90 percent of some 1,000 IT companies in Romania are foreign-owned and the government hopes exports will reach 1 billion euros in the next couple of years. In February, Bill Gates opened a Microsoft Corp. technical support center in Bucharest. The investment followed, among others, the launch of a development center by Amazon.com Inc in the university town of Iasi in 2005. That is the online retailer's only software development hub in Europe besides one in Scotland's Edinburgh. Other centers are located in India, the United States and South Africa. ""Romanian programmers are exceptionally creative. And in games, you need to explore,"" said Pohontu. Prospects for large cash inflows from the European Union after Romania joined the bloc this January, cut-rate taxes and low wages add to Romania's appeal. ""In Eastern Europe, Romania is appreciated as having the biggest growth potential together with Turkey and Russia,"" said Stefan Cojanu, head of Oracle Corp in Romania. The software maker, which has a support and software development center in Romania, has doubled its local staff to 1,000 over the last year since opening a tower office in central Bucharest. It plans to hire an additional 500 employees. ""The geographical distance, the similar time zone and business mentality argue for us to develop our activities in a country where costs are also lower,"" Cojanu said. Romania's low wages of around $600 a month compare with $1,050 in Poland and $950 in the Czech Republic. Both countries also attract hefty investment in the IT sector. However, some see a risk the sector is overheating. Double-digit wage growth and a shortage of skilled labor is dampening the enthusiasm of some investors and Romania is struggling with emigration as workers leave for better pay. ""The battle for specialists is very intense,"" said Ana Ber, head of human resources firm Dr.Pendl & Dr.Piswanger. ""There aren't enough of them, especially as many emigrated."" Industry observers say this state of affairs has prompted companies to focus on building support or software development centers, which need cheaper and lower skilled labor, rather than hiring high-end programmers. ""Romania remains good for outsourcing but not for first-class software authors,"" said Dragos Stanescu, sales and marketing manager at GECAD, a Romanian company that sold RAV Antivirus technology to Microsoft in 2003. ""The brains are already with companies that have good salaries and it is costly to buy them. A good senior programmer can earn 2,000 euros gross a month. Plus a 30 percent raise to buy him, and you have a salary of a good programmer in Germany."" FBI data show Romania may be the biggest single source of online auction fraud in the world, a multi-million dollar industry that scams people using Web sites like eBay. ""It's highly organized. They create fake accounts to trick people into thinking they are insured,"" said Gary Dickson, FBI representative in Romania. ""If Romanians were stopped, the amount of online fraud would drop significantly."" Experts say some 70 percent of software used in Romania is pirated, and salesmen still visit office buildings in central Bucharest to sell pirated CDs and DVDs. Some hackers hope their skills will help secure employment, although breaking into other people's networks for fame or as part of a job CV has its dangers. ""The Romanian hacking community is quite large. They see the computer as a ticket out of the country. It is the easiest way to get a better-paid job abroad,"" said Victor Faur. He faces a potential 54-year jail term if convicted on charges of hacking into U.S. government computers, including NASA. He was indicted in 2006. ""I saw a computer for the first time when I was 14. And I was glued (to it),"" said Faur, 23. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The number of people who have contracted a noncontagious form of meningitis linked to contaminated steroid injections soared to 91 Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The reported figure jumped by 27 people in one day, while the death toll remained at seven. Patients in nine states contracted the deadly fungal meningitis after being injected in their spine with a preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was contaminated by a fungus. The steroid is used to treat pain and inflammation. What is meningitis? The New England Compounding Center (NECC), the Massachusetts-based pharmacy that made the contaminated injections, voluntarily recalled three lots of the injected steroid last week. On Saturday, the same pharmacy announced a voluntary nationwide recall of all its other products as well. NECC said that the new recall was being announced out of an abundance of caution and that there is no indication any of its other products are contaminated. The Food and Drug Administration has already asked doctors, clinics and consumers to stop using any of the pharmacy's products. The pharmacy on Wednesday voluntarily surrendered its license to operate until the FDA investigation into the contamination is complete. Health officials say 76 medical facilities in 23 states received the contaminated steroid injections from NECC. A list of the 76 affected medical facilities is on the CDC's website at www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/meningitis-facilities-map.html. The CDC raised the death toll Saturday after two people died in Michigan. Other deaths have been reported in Maryland, Tennessee and Virginia. Tennessee is reporting the most number of overall cases -- 32 -- which includes three deaths, according to the CDC. There are also confirmed cases in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina and Ohio. The other states that received the contaminated products from NECC are California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia. Federal health inspectors began inspecting the NECC plant last Monday. Inspectors found foreign particles in unopened vials, and after testing one of the unopened vials, they determined the substance was a fungus. The investigation is still under way. Nearly 10% of drugs administered in the United States come from compound pharmacies, according to a 2003 Government Accountability Office report. Drugs manufactured by compound pharmacies do not have to go through FDA-mandated premarket approval. Instead, state health pharmacy boards are responsible for the oversight and licensing of these pharmacies. Compound pharmacists create customized medication solutions for patients for whom manufactured pharmaceuticals won't work, according to the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens like fungi, according to the CDC. Fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, it is not contagious. Symptoms of fungal meningitis are similar to symptoms from other forms of meningitis, but they often appear more gradually and can be very mild at first, the CDC says. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told CNN that fungal infections are not usually mild. He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms like headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says. Health officials say any patients who received an injection at one of the facilities beginning July 1 and who began showing symptoms between one and three weeks after being injected should see their doctor right away. The earlier a patient gets treatment, the more likely he or she will survive. Patients are treated with anti-fungal medication, which is given intravenously, so patients have to be admitted to the hospital, the CDC said. Patients may need to be treated for months. The FDA is urging anyone who has experienced problems following an injection with the NECC product to report it to MedWatch, the FDA's voluntary reporting program, by phone at 1-800-FDA-1088 or online at www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm.

"(CNN) -- A man who'd been grazed with a bullet helped subdue a gunman. An intern tended to the wounded congresswoman whose staff he'd joined just days before. A woman put an extra ammunition clip out of the gunman's reach, and a doctor who'd witnessed the shooting performed CPR on the injured. CNN Heroes salutes the following people who responded to Saturday's shooting at a political event outside a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona -- a shooting that killed six people and wounded 14 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords -- with acts of courage. Retired Army Col. Bill Badger and Roger Salzgeber . Badger and Salzgeber were two of the men who helped subdue the gunman during a pause in the shooting, according to witnesses. Badger, 74, was at the event to meet Giffords. He hit the ground when the shooting started and felt a sting on the back of his head -- he'd been grazed by a bullet. When the shooting stopped, Badger stood up and found the shooter was right in front of him, he said. ""One other individual that was there to meet with the congresswoman took one of the chairs that they had been sitting on, folded it, and hit (the gunman) ... right on the shoulders,"" Badger told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" on Monday. It's not clear who hit the gunman with the chair. Badger, bleeding from his wound, grabbed the suspect's left wrist, ""and with my right hand I hit him right between the shoulder blades, and he was going down,"" Badger said. When the suspect was on the ground, another person took a gun away from him, Badger said. Salzgeber helped to subdue the gunman, according to media reports, but his exact role isn't clear. Various people kept the gunman down for a few minutes until authorities arrived. Badger said the real hero is ""the individual that picked up the chair and hit (the gunman), and the other individual who helped me take this individual down to the ground."" A man authorities accuse of being the gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, was arrested and has been charged in federal court in connection with the shooting. Badger was treated for the bullet graze and released. Joe Zamudio . Zamudio was one of the people who helped keep the suspect pinned to the ground after he had been taken down. Zamudio was inside a nearby Walgreens when he heard the gunfire. He said he ran outside and saw people wrestling with the suspect. ""I laid on him and held him down, and made sure the gun was down,"" he said. Patricia Maisch . Maisch, 61, is credited with taking an ammunition clip from the suspect after he was wrestled to the ground. Maisch said that she dropped to the ground when the shooting started. She was about 20 feet from Giffords, who was shot in the head. When the suspect was sent to the ground, the men subduing him shouted for others to get the gun and a clip that had fallen to the ground. The suspect had pulled the clip out of his pocket, Maisch said. ""I was able to kneel up and was able to take the magazine ... before he did,"" Maisch said. Maisch then knelt on the suspect's knees a while before realizing that Badger needed help with his wound. ""So I asked another gentleman to kneel on (the suspect's) legs. I went in and got some towels from Safeway and made a compress for Bill and held it on his head until the police came,"" she said. Daniel Hernandez . Hernandez, a 20-year-old University of Arizona junior, had just started as an intern with Giffords' staff that week. He initially used his bare hands to stop blood gushing from Giffords' head after she was shot. Hernandez, who trained as a certified nursing assistant, lifted her head to make it easier for her to breathe. Eventually workers from the nearby Safeway supermarket arrived with clean smocks to cover Giffords' wound. Hernandez continued to apply pressure to the wound. ""My main thing was just to keep her as alert as possible and just keep trying to interact with her. ... The entire time I was with the congresswoman, she was still responding,"" Hernandez said. ""She was obviously in a lot of pain, so I let her know to squeeze my hand as hard as she needed to."" After an ambulance arrived, Hernandez rode with her to the hospital. ""People have been referring to me as a hero. I don't think that I am. I think the people who are heroes are people like Gabby, who have dedicated their lives to public service,"" he said. ""It just makes me happy to know that I could help her in any way that I could."" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer acknowledged Hernandez in a speech before state lawmakers on Monday, saying he ""showed no fear in the face of gunfire."" ""His quick action in going to Gabby Giffords' aid likely saved her life,"" Brewer said. Dr. Steven Rayle . Rayle was one of the people who helped hold the suspect down after the takedown. He also administered CPR to some of the wounded. Rayle said he was at the event to meet Giffords at the urging of a friend. He said he was standing at the side of Giffords' table when the shooting started. ""I looked up just as the gunman was firing the shot at Congresswoman Giffords. ... To be honest I froze for just a second, not quite understanding what was going on. He continued to fire sort of rapidly, really at point blank range,"" Rayle said . After the suspect was brought down, Rayle helped to restrain him. But the physician soon afterward started tending to the shooting victims. ""In treating gunshot wound victims, it's basically stopping the hemorrhage, and getting EMS there as soon as possible. That's basically the treatment; there's not much else you can do,"" Rayle said . ""(For) those who had actually stopped breathing or had no pulse, CPR was initiated."" CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Ted Rowlands, Jessica Yellin, Kiran Chetry, Jason Hanna and The CNN Wire contributed to this report.","CNN Heroes salutes several who jumped into action during Saturday's shooting in Arizona .

"(CNN) -- Little more than a year after he resigned in disgrace as prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi is campaigning to win his old job back -- for the fourth time. Berlusconi, the septuagenarian playboy billionaire nicknamed ""Il Cavaliere,"" has been trailing in polls behind his center-left rival, Per Luigi Bersani. But the controversial media tycoon's rise in the polls in recent weeks, combined with widespread public disillusionment and the quirks of Italy's complex electoral system, means that nothing about the race is a foregone conclusion. Why have the elections been called now? Italian parliamentarians are elected for five-year terms, with the current one due to end in April. However in December, Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party (PdL) withdrew its support from the reformist government led by Mario Monti, saying it was pursuing policies that ""were too German-centric."" Monti subsequently resigned and the parliament was dissolved. Berlusconi -- the country's longest serving post-war leader -- had resigned the prime ministerial office himself amidst a parliamentary revolt in November 2011. He left at a time of personal and national crisis, as Italy grappled with sovereign debt problems and Berlusconi faced criminal charges of tax fraud, for which he was subsequently convicted. He remains free pending an appeal. He was also embroiled in a scandal involving a young nightclub dancer - which led him to be charged with paying for sex with an underage prostitute. He was replaced by Monti, a respected economist and former European Commissioner, who was invited by Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano to lead a cabinet of unelected technocrats. Monti's government implemented a program of tax rises and austerity measures in an attempt to resolve Italy's economic crisis. Who are the candidates? The election is a four-horse race between political coalitions led by Bersani, Berlusconi, Monti, and the anti-establishment movement led by ex-comedian Beppe Grillo. Polls are banned within two weeks of election day, but the most recent ones had Bersani holding onto a slender lead over Berlusconi, followed by Grillo in distant third. READ MORE: Will Monte Paschi banking scandal throw open Italy's election race? The center-left alliance is dominated by the Democratic Party, led by Bersani. He is a former Minister of Economic Development in Romano Prodi's government from 2006-8 -- and has held a comfortable lead in polls, but that appears to be gradually being eroded by Berlusconi. Italy's political system encourages the forming of alliances, and the Democratic Party has teamed with the more left-wing Left Ecology Freedom party. The 61-year-old Bersani comes across as ""bluff and homespun, and that's part of his appeal -- or not, depending on your point of view,"" said political analyst James Walston, department chair of international relations at the American University of Rome. He described Bersani, a former communist, as a ""revised apparatchik,"" saying the reform-minded socialist was paradoxically ""far more of a free marketeer than even people on the right."" Bersani has vowed to continue with Monti's austerity measures and reforms, albeit with some adjustments, if he wins. At second place in the polls is the center-right alliance led by Berlusconi's PdL, in coalition with the right-wing, anti-immigration Northern League. Berlusconi has given conflicting signals as to whether he is running for the premiership, indicating that he would seek the job if his coalition won, but contradicting that on other occasions. In a recent speech, he proposed himself as Economy and Industry Minister, and the PdL Secretary Angelino Alfano as prime minister. Roberto Maroni, leader of the Northern League, has said the possibility of Berlusconi becoming prime minister is explicitly ruled out by the electoral pact between the parties, but the former premier has repeatedly said he plays to win, and observers believe he is unlikely to pass up the chance to lead the country again if the opportunity presents itself. Berlusconi has been campaigning as a Milan court weighs his appeal against a tax fraud conviction, for which he was sentenced to four years in jail last year. The verdict will be delivered after the elections; however, under the Italian legal system, he is entitled to a further appeal in a higher court. Because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire this year, meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time. He is also facing charges in the prostitution case (and that he tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft) -- and in a third case stands accused of revealing confidential court information relating to an investigation into a bank scandal in 2005. Despite all this, he retains strong political support from his base. ""Italy is a very forgiving society, it's partly to do with Roman Catholicism,"" said Walston. ""There's sort of a 'live and let live' idea."" Monti, the country's 69-year-old technocrat prime minister, who had never been a politician before he was appointed to lead the government, has entered the fray to lead a centrist coalition committed to continuing his reforms. The alliance includes Monti's Civic Choice for Monti, the Christian Democrats and a smaller centre-right party, Future and Freedom for Italy. As a ""senator for life,"" Monti is guaranteed a seat in the senate and does not need to run for election himself, but he is hitting the hustings on behalf of his party. In a climate of widespread public disillusionment with politics, comedian and blogger Beppe Grillo is also making gains by capturing the protest vote with his Five Star Movement. Grillo has railed against big business and the corruption of Italy's political establishment, and holds broadly euro-skeptical and pro-environmental positions. How will the election be conducted? Italy has a bicameral legislature and a voting system which even many Italians say they find confusing. Voters will be electing 315 members of the Senate, and 630 members of the Chamber of Deputies. Both houses hold the same powers, although the Senate is referred to as the upper house. Under the country's closed-list proportional representation system, each party submits ranked lists of its candidates, and is awarded seats according to the proportion of votes won -- provided it passes a minimum threshold of support. Seats in the Chamber of Deputies are on a national basis, while seats in the senate are allocated on a regional one. The party with the most votes are awarded a premium of bonus seats to give them a working majority. The prime minister needs the support of both houses to govern. Who is likely to be the next prime minister? On current polling, Bersani's bloc looks the likely victor in the Chamber of Deputies. But even if he maintains his lead in polls, he could fall short of winning the Senate, because of the rules distributing seats in that house on a regional basis. Crucial to victory in the Senate is winning the region of Lombardy, the industrial powerhouse of the north of Italy which generates a fifth of the country's wealth and is a traditional support base for Berlusconi. Often compared to the U.S. state of Ohio for the ""kingmaker"" role it plays in elections, Lombardy has more Senate seats than any other region. If no bloc succeeds in controlling both houses, the horse-trading begins in search of a broader coalition. Walston said that a coalition government between the blocs led by Bersani and Monti seemed ""almost inevitable,"" barring something ""peculiar"" happening in the final stages of the election campaign. Berlusconi, he predicted, would ""get enough votes to cause trouble."" What are the main issues? There's only really one issue on the agenda at this election. The eurozone's third largest economy is hurting, with unemployment surpassing 11% -- and hitting 37% for young people. Voters are weighing the question of whether to continue taking Monti's bitter medicine of higher taxation and austerity measures, while a contentious property tax is also proving a subject of vexed debate. Walston said the dilemma facing Italians was deciding between ""who's going to look after the country better, or who's going to look after my pocket better."" He said it appeared voters held far greater confidence in the ability of Monti and Bersani to fix the economy, while those swayed by appeals to their own finances may be more likely to support Berlusconi. But he said it appeared that few undecided voters had any faith in Berlusconi's ability to follow through on his pledges, including a recent promise to reverse the property tax. What are the ramifications of the election for Europe and the wider world? Improving the fortunes of the world's eighth largest economy is in the interests of Europe, and in turn the global economy. Italy's woes have alarmed foreign investors. However, financial commentator Nicholas Spiro, managing director of consultancy Spiro Sovereign Strategy, says the European Central Bank's bond-buying program has gone a long way to mitigating investors' concerns about the instability of Italian politics. Why is political instability so endemic to Italy? Italy has had more than 60 governments since World War II -- in large part as a by-product of a system designed to prevent the rise of another dictator. Parties can be formed and make their way on to the political main stage with relative ease -- as witnessed by the rise of Grillo's Five Star Movement, the protest party which was formed in 2009 but in local and regional elections has even outshone Berlusoni's party at times. Others point to enduringly strong regional identities as part of the recipe for the country's political fluidity.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Faster, thinner laptops with hi-res screens. FaceTime video chatting over cellular networks. And a smarter Siri. But no upgrades to Apple TV -- at least, not yet. That, in brief, is what Apple will be rolling out to its users over the next six months. The company announced these updates, and a bunch of other significant if not surprising news, during a keynote presentation Monday kicking off its annual developers' conference. Here are the highlights: . Refreshed MacBooks . The most impressive new product announced Monday may be a new MacBook laptop with a high-resolution display that Apple says will contain 5 million pixels -- 3 million more than an HD television. ""The new MacBook Pro is the most advanced Mac we have ever built,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook. The new ""retina display"" MacBook Pro measures 15.5 inches across and contains an Intel quad-core i7 processor. It will feature up to 16GB of memory and up to 768GB of internal flash storage, Marketing Vice President Phil Schiller told attendees. It goes on sale today. Schiller said the new computer's display -- similar to the one in the company's newest iPad -- is the highest-resolution display of any notebook, or simple laptop, on the market. Users will get up to 7 hours of battery life, he said. The laptop is about .7 inches thick and weighs less than 4.5 pounds -- about the size and weight of a MacBook Air, he said. Prices for the new MacBook Pro will start at $2,199 for a model with 8GB of memory. Schiller also unveiled other MacBook Pros without high-res displays but with processors he said will be 60% faster than current models. The 13-inch model will sell for $1,199 to $1,499, depending on storage, while the 15-inch will be $1,799 to $2,199. They start shipping today, he said. Schiller also introduced MacBook Air laptops with faster, new-generation Intel core processors. Prices for the 11-inch MacBook Air range from $999 to $1,199 -- $100 less than before -- while the 14-inch is $1,199 and $1,499. They also become available today, which explains why Apple's online store was down Monday morning. There was no word Monday on retina-display screens for the MacBook Air. ""The products we make, combined with the apps that you create, can fundamentally change the world,"" Cook told developers in closing the keynote. ""And, really, I can't think of a better reason for getting up in the morning."" iOS 6 and Siri . Apple also announced Monday that an improved version of voice-controlled ""assistant"" Siri is coming to iPhones -- and, for the first time, to the iPad -- as part of its newest mobile operating system. A more efficient Siri will be part of iOS 6, the next generation of the Apple system that runs iPhones and iPads. That system, which enhances mobile devices with more than 200 new features, is expected to be available this fall. Siri is going international: In addition to English and a handful of other languages she will now process Spanish, Italian, Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese -- a nod to Apple's growing popularity in China. Users will be able to ask Siri to update their status on Facebook, post to Twitter or launch an app. Siri also is becoming more of a sports fan. She will deliver scores and stats, and as seen in an onstage demo can even tell you which basketball player is taller -- Kobe Bryant or LeBron James (it's LeBron, in case you're wondering). In other iOS 6 news, Apple announced that its FaceTime video-chat feature for newer iPhones and iPads will work over cellular networks, not just Wi-Fi. As expected, Apple also is developing its own GPS-based mapping application to replace Google Maps in iOS 6. The product will work with Siri to offer voice-controlled, turn-by-turn navigation, letting motorists use it to guide them through unfamiliar neighborhoods. ""In iOS 6 we have built an entire new mapping system from the ground up. And it looks beautiful,"" said Senior VP for iOS Scott Forstall. ""We're covering the world."" The Apple maps will include a local search feature, integrated with Yelp, that already has 100 million business listings, Forstall says. Apple also will enhance its maps with a real-time traffic application that will include anonymous, crowdsourced information from users. Apple's maps app also will include a Flyover feature, which offers interactive 3-D views of popular cities.. Apple also said the next generation of its OS X operating system for laptops and desktops, dubbed Mountain Lion, will be available next month for $19.99. Mountain Lion will contain more than 2,000 new features, including iMessages, speech-to-text dictation and predictive ""smart search"" in the Safari browser. The new Mountain Lion system also adds something called Power Nap, a new feature that keeps your laptop up to date while it sleeps by automatically refreshing mail, contacts and other apps. Thirty billion apps and counting . The event runs through Friday and is the company's first World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) since co-founder and longtime chief Steve Jobs died last fall. As usual, Cook began the keynote with a batch of new stats about Apple's impressive growth. The App Store now has 400 million accounts -- the largest number of accounts with credit cards anywhere on the Internet, he said. Some 650,000 apps are now available. ""Customers have now downloaded an astounding 30 billion apps,"" Cook said. Many observers had expected Apple to announce upgrades to its Apple TV, the little box that lets users stream movies and other content from iTunes to their televisions. Experts had said such a move could be a step towards Apple launching its own TV set. But Apple made no mention of its TV product Monday. Apple has sometimes used past WWDCs to unveil new iPhones. But because its most recent model, the iPhone 4S, launched only eight months ago, most observers don't expect the next one to come until the fall.","Apple on Monday unveiled a new MacBook Pro laptop with a high-resolution screen .

"(CNN) -- School administrators carefully watched weather forecasts Thursday night with some schools in the South opting to play it safe and cancel class or close early on Friday. Forecasters at the National Weather Service are predicting 1 to 4 inches of snow for areas in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic regions on Friday with the Carolinas and Tennessee Valley getting freezing rain beginning early in the morning. Schools in Raleigh, North Carolina, will close early, a spokesman with Wake County schools said. ""We're going to make sure we put a plan in place so that the buses are rolling while it's still safe and the students are back home before weather becomes an issue,"" he told CNN affiliate WRAL. Dozens of school systems in Tennessee and some in northern Georgia said they would be closed. Travelers were already affected Thursday night. A spokeswoman for Nashville International Airport said all inbound American Airlines flights for Thursday night and Friday morning were canceled. Though she had no official word from other carriers, Emily Richard said she anticipated they also would cancel flights. On the other side of the country, relentless freezing rain in Salt Lake City forced all of the runways at the city's international airport to close, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Road crews in the South were starting to prepare for the precipitation. ""Rest assured, our team is monitoring the winter weather and have been pretreating roadways across the Commonwealth,"" the Kentucky Department of Transportation said on its Facebook page. How cold is it? Brian Fitzgerald lives on top of a mountain billed as having some of the worst weather in the world, New Hampshire's Mount Washington. And with temperatures of 22 degrees below zero and wind gusts of up to 100 mph, it's living up to that reputation. ""It certainly makes getting out of bed very difficult,"" said Fitzgerald, who lives on the mountain eight days at a stretch as a weather observer for the private Mount Washington Observatory. Wind chills on the mountain dipped to minus 85 on Wednesday. ""It's a constant blast in the face every time you go out,"" he said. That's a sentiment millions of Americans might share at the moment, even if conditions aren't quite so extreme elsewhere. In Waterville Valley, New Hampshire, the ski slopes were almost empty. ""The weather isn't quite cooperative, Drew Vetere told CNN affiliate WMUR. ""It's a good day to get some hot chocolate."" People in the Upper Midwest who have been dealing with temperatures below zero are likely to have little sympathy. ""It is going to warm up to 20 by the first of next week and I can't wait,"" said Minnesota resident Margaret Davis in a comment on a CNN story. Temperatures for the morning commute in the North Star State stayed well below zero. But as with most things, the cold is a matter of perspective ... or one-upsmanship. ""Temperatures as meager as -40 seems absurd,"" said reader Ben Edwards. ""That's what one would call a warm day up here in Fairbanks, Alaska."" Not everyone was saddened by the conditions. Cathy Bryd, a third-grade teacher in King George, Virginia, got a day off and sent in an iReport. ""This is the first snow day of the season ... I'm sure my kids are definitely enjoying [it],"" she said. She said her dog, Toby, wanted to stay out in the freezing temperatures and play in the snow. Share your cold weather stories, videos and images . iReport: Cold Wisconsin! Cold weather tricks . The drop in temperature provided many with the opportunity to conduct some unusual experiments. Several readers sent in submissions to CNN's iReport where they demonstrated the effects of the weather by tossing boiling water into the air and watching as the mist particles froze in midair. A reporter with CNN affiliate KVLY in Fargo-Grand Forks, North Dakota, used a frozen banana to hammer a nail. It worked. Others took soaking wet T-shirts, draped them on hangers and watched as the cold air quickly froze them stiff. Chicago firefighters hosing down a burning warehouse blaze ended up encasing the building in inches of ice. The cold weather was good news for those who sell hot coffee for a living. ""On days like this, coffee sells. Bagels don't,"" said Sami Akramia, a 41-year-old food cart worker bundled up in Midtown Manhattan as the temperature dropped to 4 degrees Wednesday. Deadly consequences . National Weather Service forecasters say they expect the cold weather to last throughout the week and urged caution. The frigid weather can have deadly consequences. Authorities say exposure to subfreezing temperatures left at least three people dead in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois. ""Those people who work outside have to be careful,"" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. ""We feel the wind chill, and so do pets. You need to find some place indoors and out of the wind for them."" In New York and New Jersey, homes destroyed by Superstorm Sandy in places such as New Dorp, Staten Island, and Far Rockaway, Queens, lacked basic utilities needed to restore heat. In the northern Maine town of Presque Isle, temperatures hung around 24 below Fahrenheit. And in Grand Forks, North Dakota, residents bundled up to stave off a potentially deadly wind chill that hovered even lower, around 33 below. ""The biggest thing is staying out of the wind. That's what kills you,"" said Michael Lannen, who works at a Menards hardware store in Grand Forks. ""It seems we get one of these kinds of weeks every year, so everyone is just trying to bundle up and stay indoors."" CNN's Joe Sutton, David Ariosto, Christina Zdanowicz, Daphne Sashin and Rachel Rodriguez contributed to this report.","NEW: Schools in the South take cautious approach to predictions of freezing rain .

"(CNN) -- We don't mean to scare you... No wait, actually we do, but only for a little while, and we promise the payoff will be worth the effort. These spots offer spectacular sights and experiences to travelers who are willing to face down five common, and very real, fears. All you'll need to bring with you are curiosity and courage, says psychologist Emanuel Maidenberg, director of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Clinic at UCLA. When we're in a situation that makes us fearful, ""we have to have the curiosity to say let's see what happens if I see this through, which is not easy to do, and the courage to not do what we'd normally do in this situation, try to escape."" 6 destinations with a dark side . The trick is allowing the potential for enjoyment and excitement to outweigh your hesitation over trying something that creates anxiety. The treat is the feeling of accomplishment you have when you overcome your fear. These five places offer both risks and rewards. But don't overdo it. If you have a paralyzing phobia, you'll probably want to start a little smaller and closer to home. Afraid of the dark? Slovenia . There's a reason that people throughout history hid out in caves. Caves are filled with eerie rock formations, subterranean waterways and bats (which can be scary in their own right), but mostly caves are very, very dark. You have to be brave to explore them. Or do you? With 9,023 caves, Slovenia offers more underground scenery than just about any place on earth. Start with the easiest: Postojna Jama (jama is the Slovene word for cave) is the busiest cave in Europe, receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The space is massive enough to accommodate a concert hall, a speleobiology station for the study of cave fauna and an underground railway that will carry you along a two-mile route past weird, glistening limestone formations all illuminated by electric light. When you're ready to move on to darker realms, the cave beneath Predjama Castle offers 45-minute guided tours with only flashlights for illumination. (If you chicken out, you can retreat to the castle, which dates back to the 13th century.) Skocjan Caves Regional Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site not far from Slovenia's border with Italy, is another popular spot for cavers brave and timid. Afraid of heights? Machu Picchu, Peru . Hiking the segment of the Inca Trail that goes to Machu Picchu is a dream trip for plenty of people, but most of them do not have a fear of heights. For while the standard four-day hike, which starts after a three- to four-hour ride from Cusco, is rated as moderate-to-difficult in terms of energy and experience levels, the steep, narrow Andean mountain paths could put an acrophobic on high alert. What's the reward for rising above your fears? Machu Picchu, built in the 15th century, is the ""most amazing urban creation of the Inca Empire at its height,"" according to UNESCO, which placed the site on its World Heritage list in 1983. It has weathered earthquakes, torrential rains, and nearly 600 years of existence, and it remains a remarkably well-preserved complex of buildings once used for living, working and worshipping. Dozens of licensed, local tour operators conduct guided tours to Machu Picchu, as do U.S. firms such as Boundless Journeys. All recommend spending at least two days in Cusco to acclimate to the altitude before beginning the climb to Machu Picchu, which tops out around 9,000 feet. Advance arrangements are critical as there are limits on the number of visitors to the ancient site. Afraid of Spiders? Arizona . If creepy-crawlies get under your skin, consider them in a different context. Spider Rock at Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona will help you. As far back as anyone can document, spiders have been positive symbols in Native American cultures, associated with weaving and with women, since weaving traditionally is done by women. In Navajo culture, the legend of Spider Woman is, essentially, the legend of how the Navajo came to be expert weavers. According to Adam Teller, a Navajo guide and storyteller whose family-owned company Antelope House Tours runs guided hikes and 4x4 tours through Canyon de Chelly, Spider Woman also wove blankets in which she wrapped up naughty little kids, then she'd eat them and spit out their bones to make the white stripes on Spider Rock. (But maybe that's just something his grandma told him so he'd behave). It's certainly true that the twin-peaked Spider Rock is among the more recognizable sights in Canyon de Chelly, which has the unique distinction of being the only U.S. National Park located on Navajo tribal lands. There are hikes and drives you can do without a guide, including the South Rim Drive that leads to Spider Rock, but guided tours complete with explanations of the area's significance to Navajo culture add to your appreciation. Afraid of enclosed spaces? Cu Chi Tunnels, Vietnam . Few places on earth will give you chills like the Cu Chi Tunnels, not merely because at less than three feet wide they are a claustrophobic's nightmare but mainly because of their history. Built in the 1940s during the French occupation of Vietnam, the tunnels became a powerful tool for the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, allowing them to attack and then vanish underground to escape capture. Yet the tunnels weren't only a strategic weapon: Inside the nearly 125-mile tunnel network, dug by hand and ingeniously booby-trapped for protection, people lived and worked. Once the tunnels were discovered during the war, teams of American and Australian soldiers known as Tunnel Rats infiltrated them, sometimes crawling through spaces as little as 12 inches wide to recover military information and supplies. Today the Cu Chi Tunnels are a day trip from Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) and are part of most tour programs to the area, such as the Vietnam Cultural Explorer tour offered by Boundless Journeys. Yes, the tunnels still arouse strong feelings and opinions about politics and war, but beyond that they are a tremendous testament to people's resilience and resourcefulness during wartime. They also will put your fear of enclosed spaces into perspective. Afraid of the dead? Cambridge, Massachusetts . Don't think of Mount Auburn as a cemetery. Think of it as a well-tended horticultural park with pretty one- and two-mile walking trails and lots of beautiful New England foliage from blazing red Black Gum trees to fall-blooming Witch Hazel to 26 different species of oak. That's sort of what its founders had in mind when, in 1831, the Massachusetts Horticultural Society purchased the 72 acres that would become Mount Auburn Cemetery. You can choose to see Mount Auburn purely as a park. The visitor's center sells maps for self-guided theme tours on horticulture, architecture, art, and other topics, and runs excellent docent-led tours on weekends. Eventually, though, you're bound to become curious about the people at rest in Mount Auburn, and you'll find that they include outstanding figures from all fields of endeavor, including poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow; Fannie Farmer, creator of the ""Boston Cooking-School Cookbook""; scientists and thought pioneers such as Buckminster Fuller, B.F. Skinner, and Mary Baker Eddy; as well as jurists, artists, statesmen and business leaders. You'll also learn (thanks to the ""Not So Rich and Famous"" guided tour) that many of the ordinary folks buried here have fascinating life stories as well. ""We return to the world, and we feel ourselves purer, and better, and wiser, from this communion with the dead,"" said Joseph Story in 1831 when the cemetery was consecrated. Those remain words to live by.","Not fleeing when facing anxiety has its own rewards in these fascinating places .

"Singapore (CNN) -- In a case that brought to light issues of unfair pay and poor living conditions among foreign workers in Singapore, a court sentenced four Chinese nationals to several weeks in prison for instigating an ""illegal"" strike in late November. The four, who had pleaded guilty, were led from court in handcuffs to begin their terms in Changi prison immediately. Debts and dreams: Singapore's migrant workers . In announcing their sentence, Judge See Kee Oon said it was necessary so as ""not to embolden others."" Regardless of their grievances, See said, the drivers ""could not justify taking the law into their hands."" The strike could have had the potential to ""severely affect the lives of daily commuters,"" the judge said. See said the cases were ""not the forum"" to address the workers' grievances. Worker rights advocates in Singapore say issues of unfair pay and living conditions across many of Singapore's industries, including construction, need to be addressed. In late December the head of Singapore's public bus company, SMRT ,asserted that pay for Chinese bus drivers is ""fair"" but admitted the dormitory conditions need improvement. Singapore requires 14-day notice for any strike in an industry considered an ""essential service."" In an unlikely moment in court, there was a reference to the Academy awards ceremony and actress Anne Hathaway's speech after winning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the prostitute Fantine in ""Les Miserables."" Deputy Prosecutor Francis Ng said, ""Just as Anne Hathaway"" hoped the misfortunes of Fantine would someday be found only in stories, ""similarly we hope there will be no repeat of a strike among bus drivers."" CNN's Outlook: Singapore . One of the accused, He Jun Ling, was sentenced to seven weeks in prison as the instigator who had made online postings in Mandarin urging fellow drivers to strike and telling them how to do so. A translation of one of his postings issued by Singapore's prosecutor is titled, ""The insults and humiliations suffered by Singapore drivers -- where is the dignity of the People's Republic of China bus drivers?"" The other three drivers, Liu Xiang Ying, Gao Yue Xiang and Wang Xian Jie, were sentenced to six weeks for their role in a ""conspiracy"" to instigate a strike. One other accused bus driver -- Bao Fengshan -- was deported after his guilty plea and sentencing in December. The remaining four had planned to fight the charges in a trial, but two weeks before their trial date decided to plead guilty. One of the attorneys representing the four said his clients were just happy to see the end of a difficult chapter. Defense attorney Mark Goh argued in court for a reduced sentence, saying that they had not been aware of the 14-day law, and noting that SMRT had not addressed the drivers' grievances. On November 26, 171 Chinese bus drivers went on strike alleging that Chinese nationals received lower pay than Singaporean and Malaysian drivers in Singapore, and objecting to the poor living conditions in the workers' dormitories. Twenty-nine of those drivers were immediately deported. Singapore's economy is heavily dependent on foreign labor, particularly in blue collar jobs, including construction and service work.","Four Chinese nationals are sentenced in Singapore to several weeks in prison .

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick lifted a state of emergency Thursday, one day after blizzard conditions pounded his state and created hazardous travel conditions across New England. Hundreds of schools remained closed in Massachusetts as crews continued to clear snow and to salt icy roadways, according to state Emergency Management spokesman Peter Judge. The state's 250 National Guardsmen -- who were mobilized as a precautionary measure on Wednesday -- were relieved from duty by Thursday morning, Judge said. Delta Air Lines canceled more than 200 Delta and Delta Connection flights in an effort to minimize delays, the airline said. It had canceled 1,300 flights Wednesday because of the storm. Amtrak, which had suspended rail service between New York City and points north, resumed full service by Thursday morning, according to Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole. Officials said snow accumulation in scattered areas across Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont reached up to 30 inches, while most areas received between 8 and 16 inches of snow. Snowfall in the heaviest areas reached rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Some residents in Brattleboro, Vermont, donned cross-country skis as they traveled down snow-jammed roads, while their neighbors heaved shovelfuls of snow out of driveways and sidewalks, said town resident Caleb Clark. By Thursday, some 1,500 households remained without electricity in Massachusetts, according to the National Grid utility company's website. Tens of thousands of residents had lost power Wednesday evening when high winds and fallen trees knocked out transmission-lines. The hardest-hit areas included Plymouth, Bristol, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk counties in Massachusetts, the utility company said. ""This is the second major storm we are battling in less than three weeks,"" said Christopher E. Root, National Grid senior vice president of electricity operations. ""We ask that our customers bear with us and be patient as our crews work in challenging weather conditions to restore service as safely and quickly as possible."" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said only 30 vehicles had been towed as a result of the storm. That number is in stark contrast to the thousands of cars, buses and ambulances left stranded last month after cleanup crews struggled to plow streets days after the storm. Bloomberg, who faced sharp criticism over the slow emergency response, said New York was better equipped to tackle Wednesday's storm. More than 1,700 flights were canceled at the New York area's three major airports, while hundreds more were grounded at Boston's Logan International Airport, officials said. The general manager at LaGuardia Airport, Thomas Bosco, said many airlines pre-emptively canceled flights ahead of the weather to avoid massive delays that plagued airports during last month's holiday blizzard. The storm swept into the Northeast after dumping unusually heavy snow across the South. Every U.S. state except Florida has snow on the ground, including Hawaii, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. In Atlanta, Mayor Kasim Reed pledged city streets will be able to handle weekend crowds at several downtown events, including the NFC divisional playoff game Saturday evening at the Georgia Dome. ""The administration, in conjunction with the Georgia Department of Transportation and private contractors, have worked aggressively to clear roads and ensure the safety and welfare of Atlanta residents,"" his office said in a statement Thursday. Reed came under criticism for the city's planned response to the snow, which arrived Sunday night. The city expanded its fleet of snow response equipment from 10 pieces to 58 Tuesday. By Thursday, more than 115 vehicles were clearing the effects of the largest snow event in at least a decade.","NEW: Atlanta mayor says city will be ready for NFL game .

"London (CNN) -- The deaths of two Western journalists Wednesday in Syria -- where at least three other journalists have been killed in covering the uprising -- highlight the danger reporters face in covering conflict zones. Marie Colvin, a longtime American foreign correspondent for London's The Sunday Times, and prize-winning war photographer Remi Ochlik, 28, were killed in shelling in the city of Homs, the besieged center of resistance to President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Colleagues remembered Colvin, 56, who lost her left eye to shrapnel while covering a conflict in Sri Lanka, as ""a legend"" and ""a class act."" Ochlik had covered conflicts from Haiti to Libya, and he won first prize in the 2011 World Press Photo general news category for a photograph of a rebel fighter resting in front of a rebel flag in the war-torn landscape of Libya's Ras Lanuf. The French Foreign Ministry demanded that Syria give the International Committee of the Red Cross access to Homs to remove the journalists' bodies. ""This shows how much the freedom to inform is important, how the work of a journalist can be so difficult,"" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday. ""I want to pay tribute to them because if reporters were not over there, we would not know what is going on."" At least one other journalist, photographer Paul Conroy, was wounded in the attack, The Sunday Times said, adding that initial reports suggest his wounds are not serious. The two journalists' deaths come less than a week after New York Times reporter Anthony Shadid, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, died in Syria apparently of an asthma attack. Colvin's legacy is to ""live a passionate and important life as you see it,"" her mother, Rosemarie, told CNN. ""Do what you're committed to, to the highest level you can do it -- because that's what she always did. Overcome the obstacles that you meet as best you can."" Rosemarie Colvin said she never told her daughter to stop doing her work because ""it was the most useless conversation you could have had. ... From the time she was a little child, she was committed to doing things that were important."" ""She was a ferocious correspondent, and ferociously funny,"" said CNN's Jim Clancy. ""I just loved spending hours with her talking about the people, the places and the stories."" The emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, Peter Bouckaert, called Colvin ""a legend among her fellows. She was always the first one to show up -- long before anybody else would arrive, and she really had a passion to report from these difficult places."" Bouckaert said Colvin had contacted him Tuesday about a story she had written for The Sunday Times, which requires readers to pay before gaining access to the website. ""She said, 'Please, put my story ... over the pay wall, and I will face the firing squad tomorrow at the paper. I don't often do this, but it is sickening what is happening here.' ""So, we posted the story on a private Facebook page for journalists, and another journalist commented that he was relieved that she had already left Homs. So her response, her last message to us, said, 'I think the reports of my survival may be exaggerated. I'm in Baba Amr. It's sickening trying to understand how the world can stand by and I should be hardened by now. I watched a baby die today. Shrapnel. The doctors could do nothing. His little tummy just heaved and heaved until it stopped. I'm feeling helpless as well as cold. I will try to keep getting out the information."" Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate who owns The Sunday Times, said Marie Colvin ""put her life in danger on many occasions because she was driven by a determination that the misdeeds of tyrants and the suffering of the victims did not go unreported."" And John Witherow, the editor of the paper where she worked for more than 25 years, said Colvin ""was much more than a war reporter. She was a woman with a tremendous joie de vivre, full of humor and mischief and surrounded by a large circle of friends."" See Remi Ochlik's award-winning photos here . Colvin spoke to CNN about the suffering in Homs the day before she died. She told Anderson Cooper that Syria was the worst conflict she had covered, partly because of the sheer amount of ordnance falling on Homs. ""There's a lot of snipers on the high buildings surrounding the neighborhood. I can sort of figure out where a sniper is, but you can't figure out where a shell is going to land,"" she said. Colvin had reported from many conflicts, including last year's Libyan civil war, where she saw the shelling of the rebel port city of Misrata. She stayed in the city after many of her colleagues had left, she told the Public Radio International program ""The World"" in May. ""It is very dangerous, I mean, it has to be said, and I think part of that danger is also the expectation of shelling. I mean, it's very random,"" she said. At 20, Ochlik started photographing conflicts, first in Haiti, and then he went on to cover the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the presidential elections in Haiti in 2010, and the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, his website says. His work was published by Le Monde Magazine, VSD, Paris Match, Time magazine and The Wall Street Journal. At least three other journalists have been killed in Syria's nearly year-old conflict. France 2 TV journalist Gilles Jacquier was killed on January 11 when a mortar shell struck a pro-government rally he was attending as part of a government-authorized tour of Homs, his network said. Syrian journalists Shukri Abu al-Burghul and Mazhar Tayyara were also killed. Before the deaths of Colvin and Ochlik, the Committee to Protect Journalists said that at least 11 journalists have already been killed around the world this year. CNN's Hala Gorani, who reported from Syria last summer on a government-sanctioned trip, later wrote about the dangers journalists faced. ""Away from the prying eyes of government minders, they risk imprisonment, torture, even death to cover the rebels,"" she said. Why do some journalists decide to risk so much by reporting from dangerous locations such as Syria? These journalists are ""out there doing their job not for the glory, not for the recognition, but because they genuinely believe that truth is valuable and will ultimately end suffering that otherwise would happen in the darkness,"" said Al Tompkins, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute, a leading journalism school. ""These are places where we need journalists to be,"" Tompkins told CNN. ""They are there as our surrogates, because without their firsthand information we have only the partisan government reports to rely on. We know the cost of unreliable government information."" Currently, CNN and other media outlets often cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because the Syrian regime has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. ""We know that the cost of sending journalists into harm's way can be high,"" Tompkins said. But ""the cost of not going there is even higher."" With daily reports of civilian fatalities in Syria, some critics may question the amount of attention focused on the deaths of a couple of Western journalists. But these deaths may resonate more with readers in places such as the United States, said Kelly McBride, another senior faculty member at Poynter. ""In these distant, remote conflicts, it's so hard to know what's really going on,"" McBride said. ""People actually appreciate the valor of independent journalists who do this work. ... That's why people are so upset."" Tompkins noted that ""in any story when you can attach a recognizable name and face to a story, the story becomes more relatable."" ""This would be a day where it would be right for readers, viewers, and listeners to just to take a moment and thank the brave men and women who go to the world's hellholes on their behalf, to find out what's going and bravely report it,"" Tompkins said.

"(CNN) -- Paula Kahumbu initially opted for a career in wildlife conservation so she wouldn't have to deal with people. But working with wild animals in her native Kenya has taught her that it is near impossible to prevent some vulnerable species coming into contact with human communities --- often with damaging consequences. As executive director of the Kenya Land Conservation Trust and chairman of the Friends of Nairobi National Park, Kahumbu now aims to reduce people-wildlife conflicts arising from these scenarios. ""Africa is the only continent remaining on this planet that still has its full diversity of large mammals,"" she says. ""We can't afford to lose it. We've always been able to co-exist with wildlife."" See also: Uneasy truce between Maasai and nature . In some parts of the rural Kenya however the durability of this ancient cohabitation has been tested in recent times. Lions have become a particular problem for farm owners and Maasai tribes, with whom they share the country's vast savannahs, often preying on valuable livestock. This has led many farmers and rural communities to take matters into their own hands, in some cases killing whole prides they perceive as a threat. The use of pesticides such as Furadan -- a tablespoon of which costs less than a dollar and is enough to kill a lion -- has become a particularly ruthless way of doing so. ""Kenyan lions have reduced from about 15,000 about 15 years ago to fewer than 2,000 now,"" explains Kahumbu. Read related: 'Green Nobel' fights to save Africa's rainforests . ""And we know that probably 50 percent of that is attributable directly to the use of pesticides."" Through dialogue and education programs, Kahumbu is aiming to end these practices. She hopes to show rural communities how they can coexist and even benefit from their proximity to lions. ""In many parts of Maasai land now what we have are programs where people are rewarded for protecting wildlife. They are rewarded for keeping land open."" ""They are trained so that they can participate in conservation. And they are given opportunities to get investors to come in and work with them. I really think that is the solution."" See also: Last of the bush trackers . A constructive and respectful dialogue with communities is highlighted by Kahumbu as a key factor in achieving these aims. But it's not just the human population who have been the focus of her organization's educational efforts. The Princeton University graduate is also working to train wild lions so they know not attack livestock. She admits such a tactic may sound bizarre but believes it is essential to safeguard the big cat's future in Kenya. ""Lions are very, very intelligent animals. The reason why lions don't prey on certain livestock in certain places is because they get hammered (if they do)."" ""There are ways that you can punish lions - and one of them is that you can put rock salt into a shot gun and shoot at them. It's not going to injure them or kill them but it hurts like hell. They're not going to come back because they don't want to have that pain again."" Kahumbu speaks with a passionate conviction on the benefits these training programs have brought. Yet with more than 75 percent of Kenya's wildlife inhabiting land outside of government protected areas, she admits there is only so much they can achieve on their own. It was for this reason that in 2007 she decided to join Wildlifedirect, a bloggers network which connects conservationists and publicizes conservation work across the world. She has since taken over as the website's chief executive and its popularity has soared. ""Initially all we were doing is raising money - it was every blogger for himself. And what we noticed, what I noticed, very early on is that many of the bloggers were telling the same story."" This observation helped Kahumbu grasp that the blog platform could be used as a network tool for conservationists, helping them stay in touch as well as share their research. ""All of the bloggers who were online on other predators (such as crocodiles, jackals and birds) are now sharing each other's technology and learning from each other and exchanging,"" she says. See also: Beauty trumps beast in conservation efforts . The power of communication emphasized by these exchanges has since acted as an inspiration for Kahumbu's latest conservation project --- the creation of recorded oral history of Kenya's biodiversity. ""In my work, especially working with the local communities who are dealing with wildlife on a daily basis - I have been reminded constantly (that) most of the knowledge is maintained in the minds of the elders,"" she says. ""I hear these people lamenting that old stories are now gone and nobody can tell them. Those elders are not literate - they can't record their stories."" By filming conversations with older tribes people and storing them on the internet, Kahumbu aims to keep this cultural knowledge and experience alive. She also hopes a new generation of rural Kenyan's will gain a historic perspective on how to live alongside animals such as lions. ""All they (young people) see about wildlife is killing livestock or destroying property,"" she says. ""(But) through these stories, children are able to actually discover this incredible culture and biodiversity that we have in Kenya and across Africa,"" she says.","Paula Kahumbu is a Kenyan conservationist aiming to reduce human-wildlife conflict .

"Washington (CNN) -- A former commanding officer of the USS Enterprise has had his scheduled retirement delayed pending the Navy investigation into inappropriate videos made on board the ship in 2006 and 2007, a Navy spokesman said Thursday. ""This is a prudent and necessary step as the investigation continues,"" said Rear Adm. Dennis Moynihan, chief of Navy information. Rear Adm. Lawrence Rice had been scheduled to retire on February 1. He was the senior officer on board Enterprise during at least some of the time Capt. Owens Honors was the number two officer. Honors was responsible for the raunchy videos, officials have said. Honors had become the commanding officer of the Enterprise, but was relieved of duty this month when the videos came to light inside the Navy. After serving on the Enterprise, Rice moved to Joint Forces Command, where he was until recently being reassigned to the Navy Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, Virginia, pending conclusion of the investigation. Moynihan emphasized the delay in Rice's retirement in no way suggests any outcome of the investigation. Results of the Navy investigation into the video will be given to the commander of the Navy fleet by January 24 for consideration of what further action, if any, needs to be taken, officials said. Meanwhile, the Enterprise, the Big E to her crew, embarked from Norfolk Naval Station on Thursday for another mission to a warzone under Capt. Dee Mewbourne, who took command after Honors was removed. ""The crew is ready,"" Mewbourne told reporters just before boarding the ship for a mission that's expected to take its 5,000 sailors and Marines to the Mediterranean and Arabian seas for at least six months. ""When I came aboard this ship last week I told them (the crew) that the circumstances that brought me here were very unfortunate,"" Mewbourne said. ""But we have got to look to the future and the crew acknowledged that with only about 10 days before deployment, we had to focus on what we have to do."" Mewbourne said Honors had contacted him via e-mail offering to help with the sudden command transition so close to deployment. Hundreds of family members braved the cold to say goodbye to their loved ones. None of the sailors or their family members that CNN spoke to Thursday said the video scandal would affect their mission. ""It's a non-factor,"" Ginny Watson said after saying goodbye to her youngest son, a crew member on the Enterprise. Culinary Specialist 2nd Class Melissa Williams said it is time to move on. ""We joined the military to serve our country and that's what we do. We press forward,"" Williams said. The Enterprise is the oldest active warship in the U.S. Navy. It began service in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis and has played a role in every major military action since then. The ship is nearing the end of its career, but this mission is not expected to be its last. CNN Pentagon Producer Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report .","Rear Adm.

"London (CNN) -- Italians don't tend to pay much attention to billion-dollar banking scandals when it comes to casting their votes for the country's next leader. The country is ""saturated"" with them, according to Italian politics expert Duncan McDonnell of the European University Institute in Florence. The people say ""So what?"" he adds. That indifference is reflected in January's opinion polls pointing to this month's election. But a financial scandal at the world's oldest bank, Monti dei Paschi di Siena, could upset the apathy. The scandal centers on losses of 730 million euros ($975 million) from financial products, details of which were allegedly hidden from regulators. The transactions, which took place between 2007 and 2009, have now triggered a probe into the bank's former management. The affair is exposing just how close Italy's politicians and banks are intertwined, casting a shadow over the general election on February 24 and 25. It threatens to taint the reputations of Italy's top political figures, with even European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi finding himself under media scrutiny. The scandal could also resurrect the campaign fortunes of controversial former Prime Minister and AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi. Watch more: Berlusconi wants old job back in Italy . According to McDonnell, of the three candidates running for prime minister, Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of the center-left Democratic Party and likely next prime minister, and incumbent technocratic Prime Minister Mario Monti have the most to lose. None of the candidates have been accused of any wrong-doing but McDonnell said local party officials were ""all up to their necks in Monte dei Paschi... This ought to reflect really badly on the center-left and the Democratic Party."" A city in Tuscany . Siena -- the small Tuscan city where the banking giant is headquartered -- is a stronghold for Bersani. McDonnell pointed to the Democratic Party's role in placing the chairman, Giuseppi Mussari, through the bank's largest shareholder, Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena. The foundation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Watch more: Italy faces large mountain of debt . Mussari was chairman of Monte dei Paschi from 2006 before stepping down last year after the bank's problems mounted. He is currently under investigation by prosecutors in Siena. Mussari's lawyer did not respond to requests for a comment. Last year the bank appointed Alessandro Profumo -- former CEO of Italy's biggest bank UniCredit -- as chairman and Fabrizio Viola as chief executive. Giovanni Sanfelice di Monteforte, a spokesman for Monte dei Paschi, told CNN: ""It is essential to distinguish between the past and the new management."" He added: ""Today the bank is completely independent from politics."" Bruno Tabacci is the leader of Centro Democratico, a party that together with the Democractic Party forms the center-left coalition. Speaking on behalf of both parties, Tabacci told CNN the scandal at Monte dei Paschi is due to the exclusive relationshp between the city of Siena and the bank creating ""over time clearly evident situations of conflict of interests."" He says that Monte dei Paschi is the only institution among the big Italian banks where a foundation has majority control. But Tabbaci told CNN the affair would not be decisive in the elections. He said: ""It is necessary for the interest of the account holders, consumers, family and industries that banking be clearly separated from politics. I know for a fact that Bersani agrees with me on this point."" Gianfranco Pasquino, former Italian senator of the independent left and John Hopkins Professor of Italian politics, told CNN the scandal was a bad combination of politics and banking. He said: ""The bank was controlling everything from the mayoral elections to the local basketball team."" Could scandal destabilize Italy? The Monte Paschi affair throws into question whether Italy's politicians and central bank are truly in control of the country's financial system, according to McDonnell. And it even stretches beyond Italy and to the doors of the ECB. Draghi was head of the central bank of Italy at the time of the suspect trades. Speaking at his monthly ECB press conference Thursday, Draghi said: ""You should certainly discount much of what you hear and read... as part of the regular noise that elections produce."" The revelations are unfolding even as Italy, under the helm of Monti, has entered a period of relative calm after being in the spotlight of the eurozone crisis. But Federigo Argentieri, professor of political science at the John Cabot University, says banking scandals such as Monte Paschi could pose a threat to the country's austerity drive and raise concerns over the integrity of Italy's financial system. The revelation of Monte Paschi's alleged misdemeanours forced Monti's finance minister Vittorio Grilli to answer questions in parliament last month. He told lawmakers that Italy's banks are solid and supervision by Italy's central bank was attentive. Argentieri said Grilli's remarks were an ""empty defense"" and he echoed the sentiments of Berlusconi's party secretary Angelino Alfano and Giulio Tremonti, telling CNN: ""In the first place, don't tell us that the [Democratic Party] is not involved... number two; don't tell us the Bank of Italy is completely not responsible for it."" A spokesman for Grilli declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Meanwhile, the mere suggestion the scandal could revive Berlusconi's political career is causing concern for some. Pasquino said a return to government for media tycoon Berlusconi would be a ""disaster"" for the Italian economy.","The scandal centers on losses of 730 million euros ($975 million) from financial products .

"Sunset Hills, Missouri (CNN) -- An orange X was painted on homes destroyed in a Missouri town during a series of fast-moving Midwest and Southern storms that left at least seven people dead, dozens injured and even more without a home. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Saturday toured a neighborhood in Sunset Hills, a St. Louis suburb. ""The devastation in this neighborhood was complete,"" Nixon said. ""Many of the houses we saw that were standing had the orange X on them, which means they're going to knock them down, not even try and repair them. Bottom line (is) significant property loss."" Residents from Mississippi to Missouri spent the first day of the New Year assessing the damage and sifting through piles of debris. Three people died in the small northwestern Arkansas town of Cincinnati, which reported power outages after the strong storm went through, said Ann Upton, Washington County's emergency management deputy. Two additional fatalities occurred in a trailer in Dent County, Missouri, according to Mike O'Connell of the state department of public safety. The storm also struck a trailer near Rolla, Missouri, about 106 miles southwest of St. Louis, according to the governor's office. One person died Friday and a second occupant, an 80-year-old woman, died of her injures Saturday, O'Connell said. The storm injured residents and destroyed some 25 homes in Phelps County, home to Rolla, after it earlier left more than a dozen people hospitalized in northwestern Arkansas, medical officials said. ""As soon as I shut the door everything started rumbling underneath me,"" Rolla resident Jason Stevenson told CNN affiliate KPLR. ""The whole house looked like it imploded. I got picked up and down at least three times I know of before I come to a slamming halt up against a small little tree in front of the house."" Michael Spencer, a relief worker with the American Red Cross, said some residents in Arkansas, Missouri and Mississippi already were working on their recovery plan. ""It's been just a little bit over 24 hours and families are just beginning to pick up the pieces of their lives again,"" Spencer said Saturday from Cincinnati, Arkansas. ""The roads are littered with power lines, there's tons of debris in fences and trees,"" he said, but residents are making their way to shelters to get and offer assistance. More than 30 people were gathered at the Central United Methodist Church of Cincinnati on Saturday morning to meet with Red Cross workers, Spencer said. Similar efforts are under way in Missouri and Mississippi, he said. As those states began recovery, forecasters warned of more potentially severe weather elsewhere. The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for eight counties in Alabama and three counties in Florida on Saturday. The watch extends to 5 p.m. CST. ""Unfortunately, this storm system is not letting up and we are dispatching additional Red Cross teams as the storms continue to plow across the country,"" Spencer said. In Arkansas, six homes and four chicken production facilities were destroyed, while five homes suffered moderate to heavy damage, said Matt Garrity, Benton County's manager of emergency services. A fire station, three buildings and one store were also damaged, said Garrity, and an airport that serves northwestern Arkansas was closed due to debris in the area. ""We are in part of tornado alley,"" he said. ""So even a small storm does a lot of damage."" In Mississippi, the storm system knocked out power to nearly 20,000 homes in the central part of the state, said Mara Hartman, a spokeswoman for Entergy Corporation. Elsewhere, the storm caused injuries and damage in Pulaski and Laclede counties in Missouri, knocking out power at Fort Leonard Wood, a U.S. Army post that took a direct hit from a suspected tornado, according to Laclede County Emergency Management spokesman Gail Teter. Four people at the base were treated for minor injuries after the storm hit, the army said. The tornado cut through several miles from the training areas into where families live. CNN affiliate KMOV on Friday broadcast images of heavy damage -- including destroyed homes and overturned vehicles -- in Sunset Hills, about 15 miles southwest of St. Louis. ""It's causing havoc,"" said Sunset Hills police spokeswoman Donna Palasky. Nixon declared a state of emergency in Missouri Saturday and toured a neighborhood where a suspected F-3 tornado struck, though there were no serious injuries. ""One young family, two young adults and a 9-year-old, scurried into their basement and hid in a cubbyhole and their entire house was blown away,"" he told CNN. ""If they hadn't gone down there they certainly would have had very serious injuries, if not death."" The storm also left heavy structural damage to buildings in its wake -- including a popular shopping center and Catholic church -- in the town of Fenton, some 18 miles southwest of St. Louis, said Fenton Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Heidbreder. In the nearby town of Ballwin, police spokesman Jim Heldmann said the storm caused heavy damage to homes and buildings, but no injuries were reported.

"Washington (CNN) -- She has the White House staff at her disposal, but that didn't stop first lady Michelle Obama from making a Target run in a Virginia suburb of Washington Thursday. Dressed casually in a gray Nike hat, loose floral blouse, black pants and red flats, the first lady was seen pushing a cart and carrying several bags from the mega-retailer at a Target in Alexandria, Virginia. The store is about a 15-minute drive from the White House. A photographer from The Associated Press snapped a photograph of Obama exiting the store. White House officials declined to provide any details of Thursday's outing, saying to protect her privacy they don't release information about the first lady's personal activities. They did, however, say trips like these are not uncommon. ""It is not uncommon for the First Lady to slip out to run an errand, eat at a local restaurant or otherwise enjoy the city outside the White House gates,"" Kristina Schake, Michelle Obama's communications director, said in a statement. In an interview with CNN, the manager of the Target where Obama shopped said the first lady went unrecognized while she was in the store. ""People did not approach her, she was very incognito,"" Maria Panagopulof said. ""We didn't realize truly what was happening until she had almost left. The cashier recognized her, but she was very unassuming."" Panagopulof said the store received no advance of the first lady's trip. ""We did not have advance notice; it was as big a surprise to us as it was to everyone else,"" she said. She continued, ""In hindsight, there was a sweep, but it was not obvious to us beforehand. When she left we thought 'Oh, that's what that was!'"" In May, Michelle Obama told Oprah Winfey that casual shopping trips were one of the things she missed from her life before the White House. ""I think one of the greatest sacrifices for people like us -- who like being with people â€” is that it's the bubble,"" Obama said. ""We talked about it. I can't go to Target and walk around. I guess I could but it would mess up everyone else's shopping experience.""

"(Rolling Stone) -- Since the 1999 debut of his hit series ""Family Guy,"" Seth MacFarlane has been best known for his filthy fiefdom of anarchic, envelope-pushing cartoons. Lately he's been expanding his empire, hosting ""SNL,"" recording a Grammy-nominated album of standards and show tunes, and directing a Hollywood blockbuster, ""Ted,"" in which MacFarlane gave voice to a horny, drug-abusing toy bear. His official coronation as a showbiz don came earlier this month, when he was announced as next year's Oscar host. But the 39-year-old confesses, ""I love a good fart joke."" Seth MacFarlane Tapped to Host 2013 Oscars . Why do the Oscars frequently suck, and how will you make them better? All of them have had redeeming qualities. It's about finding that balance between doing what I do but acknowledging that this is the Academy Awards, not the roast of Donald Trump. It's walking that line between old-fashioned showmanship and allowing it to be contemporary with a little bit of bite. Johnny Carson and Billy Crystal are two hosts who walked that line. There's a moment on ""Family Guy"" that's just Gene Kelly dancing with Stewie -- that's what we have to achieve, a dance between the traditional and the new. Are you going to write the show with your ""Family Guy"" team? The staff hasn't been assembled. But this is not going to be ""Family Guy Meets the Oscars."" Hosts who come in with a specific brand and try to turn the show into the brand, it never works. You have to adapt yourself to the Oscars, not vice versa. For all its success, ""Family Guy"" is sometimes dismissed as frat-boy humor. Does that surprise you? A lot of that comes, I think, from people who haven't actually seen the show. They're going with what they've heard. The show itself contains a degree of frat-boy humor -- there are fart jokes, there are shit jokes. But we try to include an equal amount of intelligent humor. If it makes you laugh, what's wrong with that? There's room for both highbrow and lowbrow. 'SNL' Recap: Frank Ocean, John Mayer and Seth MacFarlane Kick Off New Season . Louis C.K. has said he loves ""Family Guy,"" but the show has also been mocked by ""The Simpsons"" and ""South Park."" Did you ever feel like you were on the outside of some comedy in-crowd? At one point, that was the case. But the ""Family Guy"" crowd and the ""Simpsons"" crowd have become friendly over time. I thought the ""South Park"" episode making fun of us was funny and accurate. But what I don't understand is the personal venom that they spew in the press about the show and about me, where it's not in the context of a joke. That's a little baffling. They let loose with this vitriol in every interview I read with them. It'd be interesting to know where it comes from, because I don't know them. As someone who pokes fun at pieties, what are your thoughts on the ""Innocence of Muslims"" video and the riots it provoked? In all honesty, I glaze over with this stuff because it happens all the time over there. There's just constant boiling rage -- it's like, ""What else is new?"" It's just another round of religious-based fury. It's like following the presidential race. I'm yawning. I'm numb. Review: 'Ted' You're rebooting the Carl Sagan science show ""Cosmos."" Do you hope creationists tune in? Among others. The show doesn't have an agenda. It's going to be educational. Science has become politicized, and that's an embarrassment. Evolution doesn't care whether you believe in it or not, no more than gravity does. I want to rekindle excitement over what we've achieved as a species with the space program. We can't afford to regress back to the days of superstition. Surreal Kurt Cobain Tribute Staged at Art Basel . ""Ted"" was about a kid who retains a childhood fantasy into adulthood. You're unmarried, and you make your living in cartoons. Do you feel a bit like an overgrown kid? Oddly, I don't relate a lot to that character. I never had a stuffed animal I wished would come to life. The story felt universal enough to resonate. But working in entertainment, you have to retain a degree of childishness. That's one reason Spielberg has been so successful: He's been able to maintain that sense of wonder into adulthood. I suppose that makes people like us a little more stunted than everyone else, emotionally. This is from the October 25th, 2012 issue of Rolling Stone.

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- The suspect in the weekend shooting at an Arizona political meet-and-greet is scheduled to make an initial appearance Monday before a federal magistrate. Jared Lee Loughner will appear in a Phoenix, Arizona, courtroom at 2 p.m. Monday (4 p.m. ET), prosecutors said. He is accused of opening fire outside a Tucson supermarket, where U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, was meeting with constituents Saturday. Six people were killed and 14 others wounded in the shooting. Giffords remained in critical condition Sunday after being shot through the skull, while a federal judge, a congressional aide and a 9-year-old girl were among the dead. Federal authorities have charged Loughner with first-degree murder, attempted murder and attempting to kill a member of Congress, counts that involve the shootings of federal employees. State prosecutors also could bring charges in the remaining cases. A federal public defender known for handling high-profile cases, Judy Clarke, has been appointed to represent Loughner, a federal judicial source said. Clarke defended ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski and assisted in the case of confessed al Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui. Loughner has invoked his right against self-incrimination and is not talking with investigators, Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said over the weekend. But court documents released Sunday show that investigators found a letter from the congresswoman in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a similar 2007 event. ""Also recovered in the safe was an envelope with handwriting on the envelope stating, 'I planned ahead,' and 'my assassination' and the name 'Giffords,' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature,"" the affidavit says. A law enforcement official said investigators are interviewing ""anyone, everyone, we can."" Loughner's parents were cooperative when interviewed, the official said. Investigators have not found anything connecting Loughner to extremist groups, the law enforcement official said. They believe Loughner was unemployed at the time of the shooting, according to the official. Months before Saturday's shooting rampage, one of Loughner's former instructors said he saw Loughner as a threat and kicked him out of class. Loughner was ""physically removed"" from the Pima Community College algebra course in June -- less than a month after it began -- instructor Ben McGahee told CNN. McGahee said Loughner sometimes shook, blurted things out in class and appeared to be under the influence of drugs at times, McGahee said. ""I was scared of what he could do,"" McGahee said. ""I wasn't scared of him physically, but I was scared of him bringing a weapon to class."" The 9mm pistol used in Saturday's shootings was purchased at a gun store in November, FBI Director Robert Mueller told reporters Sunday. And a law enforcement source said the suspect tried to buy ammunition at a Walmart store but was turned down because of his behavior. Another Walmart store later sold him the ammunition, the source said. When he tried to enlist in the Army in 2008, the service rejected him for reasons it says it can't disclose due to privacy laws. But an administration official told CNN on Sunday that Loughner had failed a drug test. In postings on the social-media sites YouTube and MySpace, Loughner railed against government ""mind control,"" being surrounded by people he considered illiterate and the illegitimacy of the U.S. government. In class, McGahee said Loughner accused him of violating his free-speech rights: ""And of course free speech is limited in the classroom."" One such outburst was ""the straw that broke the camel's back,"" and McGahee -- who had already raised concerns about Loughner with administrators -- had him removed. Loughner ""needed psychological help,"" and McGahee said he was not surprised to hear his former student was the suspect in Saturday's bloodbath. ""This guy was mentally disturbed. He was very isolated,"" he said. In a statement Saturday night, Pima Community College said Loughner was suspended after a series of run-ins with campus police between February and September, capped by the discovery of a YouTube video in which he accused the college of operating unconstitutionally. Loughner quit school after the suspension, the college said -- and it warned him that to return, he had to present a doctor's note stating that his presence would not be ""a danger to himself or others."" McGahee said the school responded to complaints about Loughner but ""they didn't do it early enough."" ""I think they did the best they can do, but as far as the time frame goes it could have been shortened,"" he said. CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Bill Mears, Jessica Yellin and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: A law enforcement official says suspect's parents were cooperative when interviewed .

"(CNN) -- Jill Kelley was clearly conflicted as she sat down with me in a downtown Washington office to tell her story for the first time. There was so much the Tampa socialite wanted to say about being sucked into the vortex of the Gen. David Petraeus scandal, about how she was really just good friends with another top general, John Allen, and about what she sees as the media's unfair treatment of her. If you recall, the scandal forced Petraeus to resign from his post as CIA director after the FBI, in reading e-mails sent to Kelley, found he had had an extramarital affair with Paula Broadwell. Kelley played another role in the scandal after the FBI investigated whether Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, sent her inappropriate messages. In talking to me, she sensed she needed to be cautious. There were long pauses as she weighed her words, questions she refused to answer. She is not accustomed to dealing with the media and feels badly burned. Watch: Have the media unfairly tarnished Jill Kelley? When I walked in for the exclusive sit-down for The Daily Beast, I realized I knew her face well, having seen the images replayed thousands of times. But how much did any of us really know about Kelley? Already, some snark artists are accusing me of writing a ""favorable"" piece. My view is that, having been painted as the Other Other Woman in a military sex scandal, Kelley deserves the chance to tell her side of the story. Watch: Backstage at the inaugural ball, Obama's unsung army . And I circle back to this question: What, exactly, did she do to deserve this? There's no evidence the married mother of three had an affair with anyone, unlike Paula Broadwell, whose romantic liaison with Petraeus led to his downfall as CIA director. I can't vouch for everything Kelley told me. She wouldn't show me the e-mails that she received anonymously from Broadwell, which Kelley described as threatening. But she did say she was ""terrified"" and believed she had no choice but to contact the FBI. (Federal prosecutors have declined to bring charges against Broadwell over the matter). Watch: The media's failure on the Manti Te'o hoax . Nor did Kelley show me any of the e-mails she sent to Allen. We have only her word that they were merely friendly, rather than sexy or flirtatious, as some unnamed government officials have claimed. But Kelley sent and received those messages on a Yahoo account she shares with her husband, as she has no separate e-mail address. That should tell us something. She even says Allen's wife was copied on many of the notes. Oh, and she says there weren't 30,000 of them. Not even close. A few hundred, maybe. To some extent, Kelley bears the blame for the unflattering media portrait of her because she remained silent for nearly three months. I think she understands that now. Watch: Obama's digital guru talks about unplugging from the Net . But when she told me how dozens of paparazzi ruined her daughter's seventh birthday party by invading her front lawn, I felt embarrassed for the profession. Even as a sideshow to the Petraeus fiasco, the Jill Kelley saga was a legitimate story, with two top generals coming under scrutiny. But after spending a couple of hours with her, I can't say we handled it terribly well. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Jill Kelley spoke out for the first time about the Petraeus scandal .

"(CNN) -- A Florida appeals court granted George Zimmerman's request for a new judge Wednesday, saying the original judge's remarks put Zimmerman in reasonable fear of a fair trial. Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's attorneys wanted Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester removed, saying language he used in a bail order disparaged their client's character and held over his head the threat of future criminal proceedings. The Fifth District Court of Appeal agreed, and Lester must now step down. There was no immediate response to the ruling from either Lester, prosecutors or Zimmerman's attorneys. Lester revoked Zimmerman's original $150,000 bond after learning Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, failed to disclose more than $100,000 in donations from the public. The judge then set a new bail of $1 million in July, and it was the language in that bail order that Zimmerman and his lawyers took issue with. The court agreed with Zimmerman's attorneys that Lester ""made gratuitous, disparaging remarks about Mr. Zimmerman's character; advocated for Mr. Zimmerman to be prosecuted for additional crimes; offered a personal opinion about the evidence for the prosecution; continued to hold over Mr. Zimmerman's head the threat of future contempt proceedings, and ultimately set a bond at $1,000,000."" The appeals court also agreed that Lester's remarks ""created reasonable fear in Mr. Zimmerman that the court is biased against him, and, as a result of this prejudice cannot receive a fair and impartial trial or hearing by the trial court."" Florida prosecutors mistakenly release confidential Zimmerman case documents . In his July bail order, Lester wrote that ""under any defnition, the defendant has flouted the system"" and ""tried to manipulate the system when he has been presented the opportunity to do so."" Lester also wrote that it was his ""personal opinion"" that Zimmerman intentionally gave false or misleading information in his bail application -- which is a felony -- and he suggested the possibility of future contempt proceedings. ""Holding this over Mr. Zimmerman creates a horrible chilling effect on this case, on the defense presentation, and cements Mr. Zimmerman's fear that he will not get a fair trial from the trial court,"" the appeals court wrote. Zimmerman is free after posting the $1 million bond. The former neighborhood watch captain has pleaded not guilty to the charges and said he shot the 17-year-old Martin in self-defense after Martin attacked him. Martin, who was unarmed, was walking through a gated neighborhood in Sanford, Florida, to his father's girlfriend's house when he was killed.","Defendant George Zimmerman had appealed for a new judge .

"(CNN) -- For consumers, the news that the Department of Justice is suing Apple and several publishers, accusing them of price-fixing, boils down to one kitchen-table question: Will this mean my e-books will get cheaper? The short answer? More than likely, yes. But the long-term ramifications of the move remain murkier, with some arguing that prices will ultimately rise because of it. Wednesday's lawsuit centers around the 2010 release of the iPad, when the government alleges Apple colluded with six major publishing houses to raise prices on digital books. At the time, Amazon's Kindle was far and away the dominant device for e-books and Amazon forced publishers to sell most books on the devices for $9.99. Publishers argued that price was too low and, according to the Justice Department, went to Apple in 2009 looking for a way to force Amazon's hand. iPad books ultimately sold for closer to $12.99; as part of their deal with Apple, publishers only offered their books to other retailers at the same prices. After a couple of days, Amazon caved and allowed publishers to set their own prices as well. ""This action drove up e-book prices virtually overnight,"" said Sharis Pozen, head of the DOJ's antitrust division, at a news conference on Wednesday. ""Let me be clear: When companies enter agreements that prevent price competition, that is illegal."" The three publishers who have already settled with the government -- HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Hachette -- agreed to tear up current contracts and renegotiate pricing with outlets like Amazon and Barnes & Noble, whose Nook is one of the other most popular e-readers. So, what happens now? Amazon wasted no time suggesting that its prices will be dropping soon. ""This a big win for Kindle owners and we look forward to being allowed to lower prices on more Kindle books,"" an Amazon spokesman said via e-mail. That, too, will presumably lead to lower prices. And it only stands to reason that Apple would have to eventually follow suit. Apple declined to comment to CNN for this story. But some say Amazon's lower prices have been the problem all along. Scott Turow, a best-selling author and president of the Authors Guild, echoes publishing-house complaints. Calling Amazon ""the Darth Vader of the literary world,"" Turow said in an op-ed piece for Bloomberg last month that an Apple lawsuit would tilt the field too far in Amazon's favor. ""If we reinstate the status quo before Apple's ... breakthrough, then bookstores and publishers are going to be the first casualties,"" he wrote. ""Right behind them will be readers, who will see the diversity of titles and authors diminish while leading titles get more expensive."" The argument goes like this: By selling most new e-books for $9.99, Amazon is setting a price that's too low for other competitors to match in a price war. If that eventually drives the competition away, Amazon (which is already projected to account for more than half of all U.S. book sales by the end of this year) would be essentially unchecked and able to set whatever prices it wants. The current landscape ""looks like a more robust and competitive market, as opposed to the world we will be left with if the Justice Department paves the way for Amazon to return to its predatory practices,"" Turow wrote.","DOJ lawsuit against Apple will likely lower e-book prices -- at least for now .
Government says Apple conspired with publishers to drive up book prices .
Amazon, which sold books cheaper for the Kindle, says its prices will soon drop .
Some fear settlements will tilt field too far in Amazon's favor ."
"(CNN) -- We've been at the same point many times before. The industry has repeatedly promised a ""mobile advertising tipping point,"" yet despite the proliferation in smartphones, new advertising formats and new promises, mobile advertising is yet to come of age. But as the mobile industry meets in Barcelona this week, there are many reasons to feel optimistic about mobile's benefit to advertisers. There are still some hurdles to overcome and lessons to learn, but it is our belief that mobile advertising will have a long and healthy life in the future. Read more: Future of mobile is virtual reality, according to Android . Whether mobile will kill digital advertising is not the most pressing question the industry faces. True, we live in an era where disruption is the norm. We expect new businesses to emerge - often seemingly overnight - to usurp standard practice. But should we fear it? I think not. If we focus on mobile phones - then it is our expectation that mobile media will take no more than 20% of digital revenues by 2016. Yet if we include tablets within mobile media, we can predict that mobile advertising will surpass traditional digital spending by 2016. Read more: Mozilla to launch mobile phones with Firefox . In many ways digital advertisers have it easy. Seen through an advertisers' eyes, mobile is so much more complex than other media formats. Mobile screen sizes are, on average, 10 times smaller than PC screens. Mobile advertisers are working with real estate that the advertiser has to carefully plan. Additionally, the personal nature of the device means consumers do not like to be interrupted unnecessarily by untimely messages. Finally, the plethora of device and operating system choices, make it supremely challenging for brands and advertisers to understand how, when and with what to target their audiences. Read more: What smartphone feature would you like to see in the future? The mobile landscape is fast-paced and will continue to evolve, meaning existing and new challenges will continue to provoke the industry. Orange's annual independent study into mobile media habits for advertisers, showed that in the UK 82% of mobile media users access the internet primarily via the browser, compared to 61% who accessed internet information from an app. With growing HTML5 penetration, we expect web apps usage to continue to grow beyond where we are today. This will allow a much more consistent and richer offering around advertising on mobile. So mobile will certainly challenge digital. It may erode digital budgets. But it should not kill it. To think that mobile could kill off another media format would completely miss the benefit of mobile devices. Read more: 5 things to watch for at 2013's biggest mobile-tech show . Our research also revealed that one in two mobile media users is happy to receive advertising messages on their mobile phone, as long as those adverts are relevant and bring benefits to the end user, for example in the form of coupons, useful alerts, or location challenges. We see three principle reasons as to why mobile has tremendous potential: It is often the last touch-point before a purchase. Secondly it is the ""connective tissue"" linking and integrating other media formats. Finally, mobile is more personal, more social and more local than any other media. And in real terms we believe we're still two or three years away from mobile truly coming of age. But it is a tremendously exciting time, where we will see experimentation and new forms of engagement emerge, based on mobile habits. So back to the question, will mobile kill digital advertising? I don't think so. But perhaps mobile advertising's biggest threat at the moment is itself. Unless the industry works together, addresses complexity and properly understands mobile behaviours, we risk being held at a standstill and never reaching the promised tipping point.","""Many reasons to feel optimistic about mobile's benefit to advertisers,"" writes Hospital .

"Washington (CNN) -- Using firsthand accounts of coping with the threat of radioactive contamination, several Japanese citizens who lived near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant hope to convince U.S. officials that nuclear energy poses an unacceptable risk. Three operating reactors at the Fukushima facility suffered meltdowns in March from a combination of earthquake, tsunami and equipment failure that led to radiation leakage and widespread contamination. ""I come from Fukushima,"" said Sachiko Sato, a farmer, who traveled with two of her children to Washington. ""Radiation affects this absolutely unchanged scenery, but it's still very much there."" Her English wasn't perfect, but her fears came through clearly at a news conference Tuesday as she suggested that the Japanese government arbitrarily raised contamination standards to limit the payment of relocation money. Sato's farm is in an area that no longer qualifies for assistance under relaxed measurements. She asked rhetorically, ""Did they think the ability of people to sustain radiation became better after the accident?"" Two of her children, both teenagers, told of being frightened that they were exposed to radiation that could cause health problems in years to come. Yukiko Anzai, an organic farmer whose bees produce honey as an agricultural commodity, said she and her husband may have to abandon farming because they don't know how radiation will affect their bees. She told reporters, ""We have been farming for the happiness and health of the people, farming the way we did. Now we are really struggling. It is very difficult for us."" The two women are part of a group that includes activists who oppose Japan's reliance on nuclear energy and want to use the Fukushima disaster to curtail the use of atomic power. They met with U.S. congressional staff members Monday, and on Tuesday afternoon, they met with commissioners and staff members of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Japan is already at minimum reliance on atomic energy because of routine maintenance and scheduled shutdowns. Activists want to keep the plants closed. ""There are 11 still operating and 43 shut temporarily,"" said Aileen Mioko Smith of Japan's Green Action. ""They're gradually being turned off"" for maintenance, she explained, ""so unless they start up again, none will be operating by March 2012."" She acknowledged that Japan's government has every intention of restarting the nuclear plants. But Smith and the Japanese families potentially exposed to the fallout from Fukushima say they're encouraged by the German government's decision after Japan's accident to discontinue atomic power plants over the next decade. The United States and other Western countries continue to envision a role for nuclear energy with a review of safeguards. Japan's activists believe there is no safe path that includes nuclear energy. Kaori Izumi, who is fighting the restart of Japan's atomic power plants once they close for maintenance, told reporters, ""There is immense suffering in Fukushima, including Mrs. Sato and other families. The only way their suffering gets meaning is that we learn from this lesson."" Citing the well-known nuclear disasters of the past 30 years -- Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island, the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine and now Japan's Fukushima meltdown -- she said, ""Can we afford not to learn? I don't think so.""","Farm families near failed nuclear plant call for full moratoriam .

"(CNN) -- A cloud-computing company is building what it calls ""the world's first zero-emission data center"" in Iceland. The British company Colt says the data center will be powered fully by geothermal and hydroelectric sources of energy, which Iceland has in spades. The blog Earth2Tech, where we spotted this story, says Iceland could become a ""magnet"" for data centers because of the wide availability of renewable energy sources there. ""Why is a country, which blipped on the global news radar in recent months because of its ash-spewing volcano and hard-hit financial markets, such a hot place to construct data centers that could house thousands of servers and run web services for Internet giants?"" asks Katie Fehrenbacher from that GigaOm network blog. ""First off: location. Its placement between Europe and the U.S. means that companies in the U.S. can run their Web services for both continents in one location, potentially saving money,"" says Fehrenbacher. ""Secondly, because of its abundant hydropower and geothermal power, Iceland can offer data center services powered by 100% clean power for the same price or less than Web services powered by fossil fuel-based grids in other locations. Internet companies can use the clean power to market their green services, or take advantage of green subsidies in certain markets."" Bernard Geoghegan, an executive at Colt, says his company chose Iceland because of renewable energy: . ""The location of this data center has been strategically placed so that it will be the first in the world to use 100% dual sourced renewable energy sources,"" he writes in a company blog post. This development is significant because data centers -- giant warehouses of computers that store information that's on the Internet -- use lots of electricity. In the United States, these info factories account for about 1.5% of all energy use, according to a 2007 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Total data center energy use was expected to double by this year. Worldwide, data center energy use increased 56% from 2005 to 2010, according to a report from Stanford's Jonathan Koomey, which was commissioned by The New York Times. That's less than was expected, but is still significant, the report says. Colt expects its Iceland data center to be up and running within four months. Other data centers have claimed to purchase their energy from 100% renewable sources in the past, and there's some debate about what role renewable energy should play in the greening of data centers. More important than purchasing green power is using less of it, writes Ian Bitterlin at the blog Datacenter Dynamics. To this point, the EPA recently created a program to help data centers go green. The construction of the ""zero-emission"" data center in Iceland highlights another trend in information processing: Data centers are often located in bizarre places. When WikiLeaks was all over the news earlier this year, it was revealed that the secrets-leaking website stored at least some of its files in a James-Bond style data center inside a mountain in Sweden. In the U.S., these data center are often placed near rivers, so they can use the water to cool down the computer servers, or in rural areas, where they don't attract too much attention.

"(CNN) -- Michelle Asci dreamed of capturing life through her camera lens. Asci had her sights set on being a photographer as she graduated with a bachelor of fine arts degree from Georgia State University in December. But the 23-year-old is not working as a photographer. She's at a concession stand, selling popcorn or ushering people into their respective theaters before the midnight screening. Asci's been working part-time at the same Atlanta movie theater since 2005. ""It's going on to be eight years of this,"" she said. But working part-time at a movie theater was not what she saw herself doing with her degree, and she is not alone. Last month's surprising drop in U.S. unemployment rates from 8.2% to 7.8% gave many hopes that the economy is improving, and the lower rates even beat the expectations of some economists. But a breakdown of the latest jobs report shows that more than half of the jobs added this month are part-time. This leaves people like Asci wondering: Is the new American job part-time? From law dreams to data-entry . Every day, Dolores Casillas holds her breath as she walks into the Chicago bank where she works part-time doing data entry. It's a temporary position, and she's heard her boss say time and time again that there might not be a job for her one of these days. ""There was someone at my job who was working for only three weeks, and she came in one day and didn't have a job. It's nerve-wracking,"" she said. The insecurity of her part-time job is one reason behind the mounting stress facing the 27-year-old, who graduated from Northeastern Illinois University in 2010 with a degree in political science. Casillas, like many adults her age, has student loans along with a laundry list of other bills she needs to pay. She lives with her mom to offset her expenses and started working as a film and television extra on the side to supplement the part-time pay she makes at the bank. This month, she is going to be an extra on a Chicago-based television show, acting as a housekeeper. It's quite a departure from her dreams of becoming a lawyer. But she says those dreams are not realistic anymore when she thinks about the average cost of higher education. ""Law school's like, what, $75,000? I can't afford that. I tried looking for a paralegal job, but I couldn't find anything,"" she said. ""I feel like we are the confused generation,"" Casillas said. ""My mom was 24 when she got her own house and had my sister. Both my parents had jobs then, here in America. When I think about that, I think to myself, 'Wow, I don't have any of that.' "" It frustrates Casillas to compare herself with her mother, who for the past 26 years has worked at a Chicago factory to support their family. ""I thought I would get a better job than her because I have a degree. I never thought I would make less than my mom,"" she said. Still, she is grateful about her situation when she thinks about friends who are unemployed. She's persistent in applying for jobs and is willing to work random part-time jobs to help pay off her bills and loans. ""If you want to keep yourself from being homeless, don't be picky with jobs,"" she advised. From corporate suit to story reader . When Cynthia Foust saw the ""hatchet man"" at her corporate job at a North Carolina mobile company one morning in 2008, she knew that someone was getting the ax. Little did she know that it would fall on her and her entire quality service department. She was shocked and mainly hurt to see her co-workers break down in tears when they got the news of their termination. Unlike them, she was financially stable even with the loss of her job, relying on her husband with a full-time job and the money she'd saved when she was working. But after using up her severance package, she decided she needed to do more. So when she came across an ad in her local paper for a job as a story reader, she considered the idea. ""I thought it was really interesting,"" she said. ""I have a son, and when I read to him, I would do the voices and make each character sound different and use an inflection in my voice, so I thought to myself, 'I can do this.' "" Now, she works part-time reading to young children who attend at-risk schools and other learning programs. Foust spends her mornings using creative methods to tell stories to children. ""We are trying to teach kids to love reading and love books,"" she said. Foust says she finds deeper fulfillment now with her part-time job as a story reader, but she remains realistic about its ability to sustain her financially. ""This job would not be enough support my family solely,"" she said. Losing her corporate job helped her realize she wanted to spend her time differently. ""I am happy in the way my life is going right now. My son is in grad school, and my husband's job is pretty secure,"" she said. But she knows that if she did not have her savings and her husband's income to fall back on, she would have problems. ""The quality of my life improved because I have more time for my family. But the drawbacks to a part-time job are no benefits and no insurance,"" she said. Radio station worker turns entrepreneur . With more than 30 years of radio experience, Steve Hamilton could do practically every job in his Colorado building. Despite his years of experience, his varying skills sets and his degrees in mass media and broadcast meteorology, he lost his job. ""I was disappointed at losing the 'big money,' "" he said. ""But I was also excited about the new prospects of starting my own station and not having to answer to anyone but myself."" He took his job loss as an opportunity and decided to create his own Internet radio station, KHigh Radio, tapping into the smooth jazz genre that he knew had a long tradition in the Denver market. KHigh Radio is just one of three part-time jobs he works, and he admits he was making a lot more when he was working full-time with a radio station. ""I see great possibilities with Internet radio and an opportunity to make even more than my previous full-time job,"" he said. ""It will just take several more years to achieve it."" He does think the economy was a factor in losing his full-time job, and he says he did not expect to see himself working three part-time jobs at the age of 50. ""I thought I'd be full-time in radio due to my large skill set. However, I learned that economics rules,"" he said. From photography student to movie theater worker . Asci, the part-time movie theater employee, knows that the economy is directly affecting her employment situation. ""The majority of my friends are in the same boat as me,"" she said, explaining that many of them work part-time jobs as babysitters and restaurant workers. But she continues to apply for jobs every day. ""I feel like, if I stop looking, I wouldn't be as happy, because I will just be settling for something I don't want,"" she said. Her new husband, who worked part-time for several months at a furniture store, finally got offered two full-time jobs. She says that definitely gives her hope, and she has not given up on the idea of heading back to school to continue studying art and photography. ""Overall, I'm happy,"" she said. ""I'm a positive person, and if I'm at a movie theater for another year, I'll survive.""","More than half new jobs created for the month of September were part-time jobs .
Many Americans are working several part-time jobs to support themselves .
Part-time employees usually do not receive benefits or insurance .
Some people have turned the loss of full-time employment into a career opportunity ."
"(CNN) -- Sudan on Wednesday blamed Israel for an airstrike that killed two people near the coastal city of Port Sudan. ""This is foreign aggression,"" Foreign Minister Ali Ahmad Karti said. ""We know that it was an Israeli strike."" Karti said Sudan will be lodging a complaint with the U.N. Security Council. It wasn't clear who was the target of the strike, which occurred Tuesday. One of those killed in the attack was a Sudanese citizen picking up a passenger who had arrived at the Port Sudan Airport, Karti said. The passenger's identity is still unknown. Authorities have begun an investigation, he said. CNN got Karti's comments from the Sudanese Foreign Ministry. The same remarks were made at a news conference . ""We have no information that it would indicate there was a Palestinian in the car, as had been implied,"" the foreign minister said. The Israel Defense Forces had no comment on the report. Israel has identified Sudan as one of the countries through which weapons are smuggled to Hamas and other militant groups operating in the Palestinian territory of Gaza, and to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Militants lately have stepped up their rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman told an Israeli reporter in 2009 that ""Iran is using all resources and footholds for shipping weapons to Lebanon,"" and that includes Sudan. ""We have information from trusted sources that this is done, first and foremost, through Syria and Sudan,"" he said. Karti said the attack ""is meant to implicate us in terror-related activities."" He argued that Israel doesn't want Sudan removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror. Sudanese authorities said that Israel struck a Gaza-bound arms convoy in Sudan two years ago, an attack that killed 39 people. CNN's Nima Elbagir and Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","NEW: Foreign Minister says one of the dead was a Sudanese citizen .

"(CNN) -- An Australian mining magnate has commissioned a Chinese shipyard to build a replica of the ill-fated Titanic, complete in every detail but equipped with modern technology to prevent a repeat of the original's fateful maiden voyage 100 years ago. Clive Palmer, a Queensland mining billionaire with strong links to China, told Australian media that he had signed a memorandum of understanding with CSC Jinling Shipyard to build the ship. He said construction of the luxury cruise ship would begin next year and the ship would be ready to sail in 2016. ""It will be every bit as luxurious as the original Titanic but of course it will have state-of-the-art 21st century technology and the latest navigation and safety systems,"" he said in a statement. The new vessel is due to make its maiden voyage from London to New York in late 2016. The cost of the construction of the new vessel has not been revealed, a spokesman for Palmer told Australian media. ""Of course, it will sink if you put a hole in it,"" Palmer said at a press conference. ""It is going to be designed so it won't sink. But, of course, if you are superstitious like you are, you never know what could happen.'' The original Titanic -- the largest ship of its type at the time -- sank 100 years ago this month when it struck an iceberg on the night of April 15, 1912, on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. More than 1,500 people perished in the disaster, which captured the popular imagination. The ship had been vaunted as ""unsinkable.""

"(CNN) -- A top Egyptian opposition leader Saturday urged a boycott of parliamentary elections in April, describing them as ""an act of deception."" Mohamed ElBaradei is one of the leaders of Egypt's National Salvation Front, a coalition of opposition groups. In a tweet from his official account, he called for the boycott, just like he did three years ago. ""Called for parliamentary election boycott in 2010 to expose sham democracy. Today I repeat my call, will not be part of an act of deception,"" it read. But Essam Erian, a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and leader of the majority party in Egypt's upper house of Parliament, criticized the proposed boycott. ""Evading a popular test [by not participating in the parliamentary elections] only means that some people want to assume the executive powers without a democratic mandate,"" Erian said on the party's Facebook page. ""Participation [in the upcoming elections] is the best choice for any politician who has any popular support. Because if he or she has a popular majority then this will be reflected in majority wins or seats won that can translate into participation in the executive branch or remaining in Parliament as an opposition force,"" Erian said. On Saturday, Egypt changed the series of dates for the country's parliamentary elections in several areas to accommodate Coptic Christians and their Easter celebrations, state-run Middle East News Agency reported. President Mohamed Morsy decreed the changes, the agency said. The first stage of the elections will be held April 22-23 instead of April 27-28 in the governorates of Cairo, Behaira, Minya, Port Said and Northern Sinai. The second stage will be held on May 11-12 instead of May 15-16 in Giza, Alexandria, Sohaj, Bani Swaif, Aswan, Suez, Red Sea and New Valley. The runoff will be held May 19-20 instead of May 22 and 23 in those areas, the agency said. The third stage will be held May 28-29 instead of June 2-3 in Daqahliya, Qalyubia, Monufia, Qena, Damietta, Luxor, Matrouh and South Sinai. The runoff will be held on June 5-6 instead of June 9-10. The fourth stage will be held on June 15-16 instead of June 19-20 in Sharqia, Gharbia, Assiut, Kafr el-Sheikh, Fayoum and Ismailia. The runoff will be held on June 23-24 instead of June 26 and 27. The House of Representatives, the lower house in Egypt's bicameral system, will hold its first session July 2 instead of July 6, the agency said. The elections will be the first since Egypt's highest court dissolved the lower house of parliament in June, and it will be the first full Parliament in Morsy's presidency. The upper house, the Shura Council, has continued to meet. In the past year, violent clashes in Port Said, a coastal province along the Suez Canal, have highlighted the longstanding resentment residents there feel toward Cairo. Previous elections have been held in three stages, rather than four. On Friday, ElBaradei tweeted: Morsy's ""decision to go for parliamentary elections amidst severe societal polarization & eroding state authority is a recipe for disaster."" ElBaradei headed the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, from 1997 to 2009. He also ran unsuccessfully in Egypt's presidential election last year.

"Solomon Islands (CNN) -- After the furor caused by a French magazine's decision to publish topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge, she and Prince William will be more than ready to get away from it all in the South Pacific. As they arrive in the Solomon Islands on the next step of their Asian tour, ""Welkom William and Kate"" is the message the royal couple will see on huge billboards scattered across the capital, Honiara. And in a straw poll of residents, it's clear the city is more than excited about the couple's arrival on Sunday. One man told me he will be heading to the airport early to catch a glimpse of them. He guessed half the population will turn out for the ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity to see the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The couple are no doubt set for a big South Pacific welcome, involving not just big crowds but music and dancers. They will surely smile when they see their ground transport -- a pick-up truck dressed up as a canoe. Oarsmen will pretend to row the couple into town. Opinion: British privacy should start with British press . Later in the trip they will take to a real canoe, with rowers who will take them to a paradise island, accompanied by swimmers dressed as sharks. This leg of the tour will be full of photo opportunities -- but Kate and William may well have mixed views about that. The last leg to Malaysia was overshadowed by the French magazine Closer's decision to publish pictures of Kate sunbathing topless while on a private holiday with William in France. She was upset, William is angry and they have both decided to take legal action against the publisher. But this is part of a bigger battle. They are trying to set a precedent; drawing a line under what they see as creeping media intrusion. William is fiercely protective of his wife and he is determined to protect her from the fate of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who was hounded by the paparazzi right up to the moment she died in Paris. After Diana: How can intimate royal snaps be published in France? What will hearten, and possibly surprise, William and Kate when they get here is that nobody is talking about the topless pictures. I can't see a mention of it in the papers and people seem much more interested in catching a glimpse of the couple and celebrating this moment when the Solomons take a rare step into the global spotlight. It's really only the media pack accompanying the tour that is discussing the photos -- because that's what's making the headlines in Europe, the United States and Australia. There is some apprehension among the accredited photographers that Kate and William will now become even more shy of the cameras, but the palace says the couple are determined to carry on with the tour as planned. They don't want their trip to be ruined by the magazine scandal and it seems the islanders awaiting their arrival feel the same. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge look set to have some respite and some fun in the Solomon Islands. But as this week has demonstrated, nothing about royal tours is predictable.","William and Catherine are on a tour of southeast Asian nations .

"(CNN) -- So, it turns out that flirting at work really can get you ahead -- at least according to one study, which says that with no serious intentions, it can really pay off in negotiations. But would any woman use these tactics in the real world? Should she? We asked one successful entrepreneur, Victoria Pynchon, co-founder of She Negotiates Consulting, which helps women get better at asking for raises and promotions. Pynchon thinks it's ok and, in fact, necessary. She told us why in this opinion piece: Why it's ok for women to flirt at work. It got a huge response from CNN readers and on social media -- with strong opinions both for and against. Nearly 200 people took part in our quick vote and we found that there was an almost equal number who were ok with flirting at work and those who weren't. We also asked our friends at The Levo League, an online community for women in the first decade of their careers, to see what the next generation of professionals think. Below we've collated a selection of the best comments from our users and The Levo League community. FOR . ChrisMay: ""Whether anyone likes it or not, sex sells. And when a woman puts herself through school and gains competence, when she discovers that she is in an environment where her competence has taken a back seat to her bust size, then she is given a license to pull out the big guns; it becomes a tool. If she abuses it, it can bite back. If she's smart, she'll strike a balance that sends the brainless male side spinning like a top as she climbs the corporate ladder. I see it every day. It's an art form. You go girl."" Martina Lundardelli: ""It means we, as women, can be charming but in a positive way. Our attitude towards problems and life in general is charming. Since work is a part of our lives, we should just remain women. We still continue using our brains, our skills and our competitiveness, but with elegance and an attitude that is a feature of our gender. So yes, I do agree."" Lila Barton, 22, on The Levo League: ""It's no secret that women have a certain ""feminine charm."" Since the beginning of time, men have been captivated, confused, and absolutely in love with it. But when it comes to using this charm to get what you want, women have to be extremely careful ... Every woman understands when they cross the line between being warm and friendly to flirtatious."" Zac: ""Women will use their charms, not because its right or wrong, but because its a part of their toolset. As a guy, I think it's unfair, but the world is an unfair place and I know that if I had the opportunity to juke the system to get what I want, I probably would."" AGAINST . Guy: ""I worked with many women below, beside and above me, and the most successful and respected women managers were acting just like themselves and not trying to emulate men and never used charm or their beautify to manipulate the situations ... in some respects women have a natural tendency to be good managers, they can also endure hard work better than men and they have better abilities than men to talk themselves out of trouble."" Russell Conner: ""Sure they can (flirt at work), and I can put them in the same category as butt-kissers and yes-men. I have followed, mentored, supported and even stepped aside for competent and talented women. Some of whom I never met in person, no 'female charms' in play.

Maxie McCoy on The Levo League: ""I think it (is) a very slippery slope to view flirting as an asset to negotiation and getting what you want ...

Yosisme: ""Isn't saying it's ok to make vague sexual references (flattery/flirting) to co-workers to gain influence, sort of like saying it is ok to intimidate people to get what you want as long as you don't follow through on the threat? ...

"(CNN) -- Tomas Berdych has launched a scathing attack on the time limit rule in tennis following his victory against Germany's Tobias Kamke at the Dubai Open Wednesday. The World No.6 is a fierce critic of the new 25-second time rule, which has reduced the permitted pause in between rallies by five seconds. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which runs the men's tour, introduced the change at the start of the year in a bid to give umpires greater powers. Czech Berdych, who lost out in the final of the Marseille Open last Sunday, has been warned against time wasting on several occasions in recent weeks. Federer eyes grand slam titles in 2013 . The new rule is supposed to make the game more entertaining for spectators and speed up a sport where the average contest has only 20 minutes of action in an hour. But Berdych, who was clearly suffering with fatigue following his exertions 4,800 kilometers away in France, says the rule needs modifying. ""I don't like it. I'm not a fan of it. I don't see any single reason why to have this rule,"" he told reporters. ""What could be positive on this? What could work? What could be advantage? ""I get like a six or seven (warnings) in Chennai and then I did not get one in Marseille and now I just get only warning. So I'm improving. Tsonga and Ferrer battle to title wins . ""It should be clearer what's going on, because the referee has so much power on you. ""He can do whatever he wants.

Simple as that if they want to go straight."" Berdych clearly struggled to adapt to the heat and wind in the Gulf, saving 12 break points and dropping serve twice before prevailing 7-5 6-1 to make the last eight.

"(CNN) -- In an incident eerily similar to a sexual assault that sent shock waves worldwide, Indian police say a woman was gang-raped over the weekend by seven men after she boarded a bus at night. Police have arrested all seven suspects, including the bus driver, after the alleged Friday night attack in the Gurdaspur district of Punjab state. Actress Freida Pinto, best known for her ""Slumdog Millionaire"" role, talked to CNN's Erin Burnett about her own experience and what it's going to take the change the situation forever. CNN: As a woman growing up in India, do these stories shock you? Freida Pinto: Growing up in India, I remember picking up the newspaper almost every day, and by the time you reach the fourth and the fifth page, there'd be a little column in the corner that would be dedicated to a rape case that was reported. And the sad part is that those rape cases are just reported, and there was no follow-up after that. It kind of made me wonder as a girl growing up in India if forever as a girl, I would have to live in the fear of this might just happen to me. The challenges of being a woman in India . CNN: What was your reaction when you found out about the rape of the 23-year-old woman, the one that has galvanized the world? ... Were you surprised when that rape, given what you said about it being in the paper every day, when that rape was the one that inspired and motivated people? Pinto: In a way, actually, I was. What was shocking was the reaction. And I think it was a very appropriate and much required reaction. Would have been wonderful if it happens many, many years ago, but the fact that it happened finally is what is really important. I hope these voices don't die out, because what happens in situations like I was telling you, even growing up, just reading about them and you read them every day, and it's sickening to read them every day, to the point that you don't want to read it after a while. And I hope it doesn't reach a stage as that, that you kind of let it pass. You want something to be done, and these voices cannot be shut down anymore. And the youth are so powerful, so they need to continue. CNN: This has been a part of what you are and what you have been fighting for. Professionally, you played a victim of sexual violence in two films, ""Trishna"" and your breakthrough role, of course, as Latika in the award-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire."" ... When you look at (those films), is that dramatized, or is that a reflection of reality? Take action to change the world for girls . Pinto: Well, denigration of women in society, in a misogynistic society, is not uncommon. It's heard of, and it happens not just in India, but it happens in so many parts of the world. We women as actors, we portray these roles in the hope that someone will listen and want to make a change and not just a film role that was played and then forgotten or just praised for the performance of how good the film was. CNN: I know you experienced firsthand, the fear of men. And I know your mother did also. Pinto: Right. One of her first horrifying experiences was when she was traveling, and she had one of these men on a delivery bike decided to kick her in the chest for a good feel, if you please, and he sped away with a laugh on his face. And my mother was so petrified, so shocked, she did not know how to react at that point in time. So she decided to carry stones in her bag so she could attack him the next time she saw him. You never really think it could happen to you, right? So you continue with your everyday life. It's not about the dress you wear or the kind of clothes you wear, because how would you then explain the rape of a 4-year-old child or a 65-year-old woman? You wouldn't be able to explain that. So you continue living, thinking, ""I'm going to be fine."" And then one fine day, you're just marked for such brutality. CNN: Now, Freida, we keep hearing that the young woman's rape will spark change in India, but the two rapes that have happened since that horrific act are barbaric also, as we described. Do you think anything will change, or will there just be a hue and an outcry, and it will essentially go back to the way it was before? Pinto: I love being an optimist, even in situations like this, because that's all you can do after a while. As soon as you become cynical, you kind of end up living a life of extreme dread and fear as well. And I want to be hopeful, and so, I want to live in the hope that this change can happen. It's not going to happen overnight, and we are not going to be idealists about that. It's going to take time. But that's why I feel we cannot be once again put into a situation of forced amnesia. We need to keep this fight alive. We need to keep the protest alive. Do the math: Girls + education = ...","Recent gang rapes in India have grabbed the world's attention .

"(CNN) -- A hacker falsely posted on the Twitter account of Oscar Pistorius' older brother Saturday that the South African Olympian was going to do media interviews, a family spokeswoman said. Carl Pistorius didn't post such a tweet, and he and his sister, Aimee, were canceling all their social media accounts Saturday, said family spokeswoman Janine Hills. All three Pistorius siblings live in South Africa, she said. On Friday, Oscar Pistorius was freed from jail on $112,000 bail eight days after the shooting death of his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, 29. Pistorius, 26, is charged with premeditated murder in her February 14 death. ""It is most unfortunate that during this sensitive time, someone would choose to hack into Oscar Pistorius older brother, Carl Pistorius' Twitter handle,"" Hills said in a statement. ""Carl did not tweet this afternoon, out of respect to Oscar and Reeva.""

"Editor's note: Jennifer Klein is professor of history at Yale University and the author of ""For All These Rights: Business, Labor, and the Shaping of America's Public-Private Welfare State."" Her forthcoming book, ""Caring For America,"" co-authored with Eileen Boris, will be published by Oxford University Press next year. Jennifer Klein says government has played a key role in gaining health care security for workers. NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN) -- ""We worked hard to get it and we're going to keep it,"" said Nancy Snyder, one of the protesters attending this summer's health care town meetings. Nancy and her husband Robert, retirees from Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, showed up at a town hall held by Sen. Arlen Specter, in State College, Pennsylvania, with signs condemning socialist takeover of their health care, and she was interviewed by Michel Martin on National Public Radio's ""Tell Me More."" When asked how she had insurance coverage, Nancy explained that because her husband was a retired coal miner, they received insurance and care through the United Mine Workers. She attended the town hall because she said she had ""had enough of the government interfering with our lives, after working hard all of our lives, especially to get the health care."" The historical reality, however, is that there would be no UMW health and retirement plan without the federal government. Our inability to acknowledge the real role of government plays right into the hands of private companies that have never solved the challenges of health security. In April 1946, John L. Lewis, leader of the UMW, led the coal miners out on strike around a pioneering demand: employer contributions to a union health and welfare fund. Miners had long suffered debilitating health problems and notorious medical neglect in camps and towns run by authoritarian mine companies. For Lewis, changing the balance of power between workers and owners necessitated independent and guaranteed health security, but the mine owners had no intention of settling. Facing a strike that could choke the economy, President Harry Truman intervened through the War Labor Disputes Act. With the mines officially under federal jurisdiction, Truman was ready to make a deal. The mine owners however were not as eager. Truman pressured mine owners into signing a contract in which they would pay for a union Welfare and Retirement Fund -- hospital, medical, and retirement plans -- all financed by a royalty assessed on the amount of coal extracted by union workers. The Social Security Administration provided technical assistance in designing the union-run welfare program. The settlement was industry-wide, regardless of company, thus equalizing the sharing of risk and the benefits of ""social"" insurance. The Social Security Administration and the Public Health Service recruited staff for the UMW program. Physicians, public health experts, and industrial health experts came from the Public Health Service and the Farm Security Administration. The FSA had successfully run rural medical programs during the 1930s and World War II. Through the fund, UMW built a network of well equipped, modern hospitals, bringing about a major improvement in living standards. Over the next two decades, federal subsidy became more direct. Social Security disability benefits and federal rehabilitation programs aided thousands of disabled miners, many of whom had been bedridden for years. By picking up the tab for rehabilitation and disability support, the federal government also kept the UMW program financially sustainable. As employment declined and mining families struggled in the 1960s, mineworkers launched widespread protest demonstrations and traveled to Washington to lobby for federal support of UMW hospitals. Presidents Kennedy and Johnson responded with the Area Redevelopment Administration, the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act, the Appalachian Redevelopment Act, and of course, Medicare. Government stabilized and expanded the miners' health system. Miners were proud beneficiaries of Johnson's Great Society -- today so much maligned by the conservative talk show hosts. Miners continued their pressure, leading to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, marshalling public force to protect their health in the private workplace. If Nancy Snyder ""did not pay one penny""  for her husband's cancer treatment or her surgeries, it's because government subsidized that care since Robert's early days as a miner. While she and her husband undoubtedly worked hard for what they have, these were by no means individual or private achievements. They represent shared social projects that were fought for and won collectively. The entire system of employee health insurance emerged because of direct federal support for unions and collective bargaining during the formative decades of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. The thousands of people who poured into the Remote Area Medical care emergency clinic on one August weekend in Virginia have no health insurance. They are suffering like the miners of 80 years ago. Who will tip the balance of power again in their favor? Health care reform will derail once more if we can't learn to talk honestly about public benefits and public goods -- how they protect us from the insecurities and inequities of the market and promote genuine economic security in the face of real imbalances of economic power and resources. The only moments when health security has been achieved in America are those founded on a partnership between empowered citizens and the federal government. It's been the American way all along. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer Klein.","Jennifer Klein: Town hall protesters opposed changes to health care system .

"London (CNN) -- A murderer is at large in England, police warned in connection with a case that has gripped the country for more than two weeks. Joanna Yeates, 25, disappeared on December 17 in the city of Bristol in western England. Her body was found on Christmas Day by a couple walking their dogs a few miles from where she lived, police said. Her parents said the discovery of the body was a relief, but the confirmation she had been murdered ""only intensified our grief. ""She was a beautiful and talented young lady who was destined to fly high. Her life was stolen from her and she was stolen from us,"" they said in a statement on New Year's Day. Her boyfriend, Greg Reardon, said he would always love her and hoped ""for her sake, justice is found swiftly."" Yeates had been out with friends on the day she vanished, and was last seen alive buying a pizza at 8:40 p.m. that Friday night. Reardon alerted the police when he got home to their apartment December 19 after a weekend away. Her keys, purse and bank cards were in the apartment, along with a receipt for the pizza. The investigation became a murder inquiry on December 28 after an autopsy concluded that Yeates had been strangled. A 65-year-old man was arrested on December 30. British media identified him as Yeates' landlord. He was released on bail January 1. Bristol police have more than 70 officers and staff working on the case, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones said the day the man was released. Chief Superintendent Jon Stratford said Sunday that ""whoever killed Jo remains at large,"" and said people should take ""the usual safety precautions. ""Lone women should avoid walking home alone after dark and householders should keep their premises secure and take care answering the door to strangers,"" he said, adding that there was ""no specific intelligence or information to suggest there is an increased threat to their safety at this time.""

"(CNN) -- I love being reminded I'm totally unnecessary. On Thursday, I hosted tried to host a live video chat with Andrew Derocher, a polar bear researcher and professor at the University of Alberta. The goal was to answer a few of the many, many questions readers asked about my story this week on a plan to air-drop food on struggling polar bears in the Arctic. A few minutes into the chat on Spreecast, however, my Wi-Fi connection dropped out and I disappeared from the screen, leaving Derocher to fend for himself. He's a rock star -- so of course he barely missed a beat. ""I can see myself here on air, but I can't see John right now,"" the scientist said, calm, cool and collected. ""I guess if people type in questions we can continue on."" I popped back on screen soon, but it wouldn't have mattered one way or the other. Derocher did a great job tackling a range of questions about his polar bear plans, which he outlined in a recent paper for the journal Conservation Letters. The most interesting question was along these lines: Since the polar bear's sea-ice habitat is melting, why don't we just engineer a habitat for them? Some of you suggested a series of plastic islands that would help polar bears reach seals (their food) out in the middle of the ocean. Others suggested recycling plastics for this purpose. ""The issue of creating some sort of platform in the Arctic is an interesting sort of idea,"" Derocher said on video from Canada (which, apparently, has better Internet connections than our offices in New York). ""The challenge is really one of scale. When you look at the size of a polar bear's home range -- the size they wander over in a year -- you're basically talking (about) an area that's two-thirds the size of Texas. So these are huge areas. And if you go around the circumpolar Arctic, there's so much habitat that would have to be put in place that it's basically untenable in terms of a spacial scale."" The other issue: Plastic doesn't support life the way ice does. ""You have to think about sea ice more akin to soil in a terrestrial ecosystem,"" he said. He topped off the explanation with a stellar analogy: . ""It's like trying to grow a forest in a bunch of Styrofoam chips."" So, the bottom line on that: No sea ice, no polar bears. You can watch the whole Spreecast here (sorry for the train wreck of technical issues at the beginning of the video). My other favorite thread of conversation on this topic concerned the value of a polar bear life versus a human life. Some of you asked why we would consider air-lifting polar bear food to the Arctic when there are so many poor and starving people on our planet today. ""We're going to have a lot more poor and starving people if we don't deal with the climate change issue in a realistic fashion,"" Derocher said. ""Polar bears are telling us we're living too heavily on this planet and we're extracting too many resources and putting our waste into the atmosphere. ... I view the problems the polar bears are going to be facing largely as a precursor to the sorts of problems that humans are going to be facing."" If you've got more questions, keep 'em coming. I'll do my best to find a stable enough Internet connection -- and an answer. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","John Sutter: A researcher and I hosted a live chat about how we can save polar bears .

"Vatican City (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI delivered his final public prayer ceremony Sunday to a crowd of thousands at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, amid rumors of a sex scandal brewing as he prepares to step down. ""Thank you for your affection,"" the pope told the crowd as he appeared at the window of his apartment overlooking the square. As is customary, he opened the weekly Angelus prayer with a short sermon. Benedict spoke on the Transfiguration of Christ, one of the key moments in Jesus' life on Earth, when, according to the church, he took three disciples to pray on a mountain. During his prayers, Jesus was miraculously changed and filled with light. Read the full text of Benedict's sermon . The crowd interrupted Benedict with rousing applause, as he told them that God wanted him to do the same. ""The Lord is calling me to go on top of the hill, to dedicate myself once more to prayer and meditation,"" he said. ""But this does not mean to abandon the church."" Resignation and rumors . This month, Benedict shocked the world with the announcement that he would step down. Thursday is his last day as acting pope. The Italian media has been abuzz in recent days with allegations that gay clergy may have made themselves vulnerable to blackmail by male prostitutes, setting off speculation that a brewing scandal may have triggered Benedict's resignation. The Vatican vehemently denied the allegations Saturday. Interactive: Where does the pope live? Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone said it was ""deplorable"" that as the time for the Roman Catholic cardinals to elect a new pope approaches, a rash of ""often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories"" has appeared. As the first pontiff to step down in six centuries, Benedict said he is resigning ""because of advanced age."" He is 85. ""Strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me,"" Benedict said when he announced his retirement this month. Shortly after the pope's announcement nearly two weeks ago, a different rumor began making its way through the Italian media: Allegations that the pontiff's decision was linked to a medical procedure to replace the battery in his pacemaker. A Vatican spokesman dismissed the idea at the time. CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen has said that clergy members trying to cover up their sex lives may well be creating problems in the Catholic Church, as they have in the past. But he believes that the current unsourced speculation in the Italian media should be taken with a grain of salt. Several years ago, Benedict suggested he would be open to resigning should his health fail, Allen has said. Wrapping up a papacy . After the sermon, he chanted the Angelus, a common Catholic prayer, with the crowd. It begins with: ""The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary. And she conceived by the power of Holy Spirit. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus."" The throng of spectators extended beyond the borders of the piazza, some waving flags from nations around the world and holding up signs with words of thanks for the departing head of the Catholic Church. He ended his message with: ""Let's always be close in prayer."" Sunday's Angelus will not be Benedict's final public appearance, as he is scheduled to hold a general audience Wednesday, according to the Vatican. He will hold a ""meet and greet"" with cardinals late Thursday morning before stepping down the same evening, the Vatican website said. Benedict was dean of the College of Cardinals in 2005 when he became the sixth German to be picked as pope, albeit the first since the 11th century. At the time, the church was facing several pressing issues, including a growing crisis over the church's role in handling molestation accusations against priests around the world. The pontiff will leave office at 8 p.m. on February 28, two-and-a-half weeks after he shocked the Roman Catholic world by announcing his resignation. The Vatican has said a new pope will be in place for the church's Easter celebrations on March 31. Benedict will begin his retirement in the papal summer residence in Castel Gandolfo before he withdraws to a monastery being built for him in Vatican City, a Vatican spokesman has said. He will then lead a cloistered life, the spokesman said. CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Vatican City, and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","The pope says his decision was the result of a calling from God .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates said missile strikes in Pakistan will continue in an effort to root out al Qaeda members. Robert Gates testifies Tuesday before a Senate panel. He was wearing bandages from surgery he had on his arm. Gates spoke to the Senate Armed Services Committee in his first comments to Congress as President Obama's defense secretary. In response to a question from committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, Gates said the strikes will continue to target terrorists who have based themselves across the border from Afghanistan. ""Let me just say, both President Bush and President Obama have made clear that we will go after al Qaeda wherever al Qaeda is. And we will continue to pursue this,"" Gates said. Asked by Levin whether Pakistan is aware of this continued pursuit, Gates replied simply, ""Yes, sir."" Seventeen people were killed Friday in two missile strikes in the ungoverned tribal area of Pakistan. A government official and two military officials said they were U.S. attacks. They were the first such strikes since Obama took office Tuesday. The tribal region of Pakistan has seen a sharp spike in the number of aerial attacks carried out by unmanned drones. The United States has the only military with drones operating in the area. In 2008, there were 30 suspected U.S. missile strikes in Pakistan, based on a count by CNN in Islamabad. Gates opened his comments with a clear message that Afghanistan is at the top of his to-do list. In one of the clearest indications of the military planning for adding troops, Gates outlined a deployment of two brigades by spring and the third by late summer. Read Gates' prepared testimony (PDF) Additional troops, even if available to deploy, could not be added until later this year because it would take that much time to build out the required infrastructure in Afghanistan to support the troops, Gates explained. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who was instrumental in pushing for a troop surge in Iraq, warned that a troop increase in Afghanistan may not achieve the same results. Gates himself noted that increased military presence must be accompanied by non-military solutions if progress is to be made in the war. When Gates arrived for his testimony Tuesday, he wore bandages on his left arm and had his suit jacket draped over his left shoulder. He had surgery Friday after tearing his biceps tendon while trying to attach a snow plow blade to his tractor. Regarding withdrawal from Iraq, Gates said the military is planning various options, with the quickest withdrawal being the 16-month period -- ending in May 2010 -- outlined by Obama when he was running for president. ""We are working on a range of options for the president,"" he said. Among them is ""essentially a completion of the work of the brigade combat teams and a transition to an assist-and-advisory role beginning at 16 months and proceeding further forward."" Under a recently approved agreement with Iraq, the United States is required to have all troops out by the end of 2011. Even after that, however, Gates indicated that a continued role of some kind is likely. ""As our military presence decreases over time, we should still expect to be involved in Iraq on some level for many years to come, assuming a sovereign Iraq continues to seek our partnership,"" he said. ""The stability of Iraq remains critical to the future of the Middle East, a region that multiple presidents of both political parties have considered vital to the national security of the United States."" Gates also acknowledged that some decisions he had decided to put off when he was Bush's defense secretary are now back on his plate, especially the budget. ""As I focused on the wars these past two years, I ended up punting a number of procurement decisions that I believed would be more appropriately handled by my successor and a new administration. Well, as luck would have it, I am now the receiver of those punts, and in this game there are no fair catches,"" Gates noted. ""While this will undoubtedly be a long and difficult fight, we can attain what I believe should be among our strategic objectives: an Afghan people who do not provide a safe haven for al Qaeda, reject the rule of the Taliban, and support the legitimate government that they elected and in which they have a stake,"" Gates said.","Defense secretary says efforts to root out al Qaeda in Pakistan will continue .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. and Japanese authorities have ordered airlines to stop flying their Boeing 787s until they can show they've fixed a fire risk linked to battery failures aboard the closely watched Dreamliners. The moves by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the Japanese government follow an emergency landing in Japan that prompted that country's two major airlines to ground their fleets of 787s, and a similar problem aboard a Dreamliner on the ground in Boston nine days earlier. ""The battery failures resulted in release of flammable electrolytes, heat damage, and smoke on two Model 787 airplanes,"" the FAA announced Wednesday evening. ""The root cause of these failures is currently under investigation. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical systems and structures, and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment."" The only U.S. carrier to operate the eagerly awaited, long-delayed jetliner is United Airlines, which said earlier Wednesday that it had inspected its fleet of six 787s and would continue flying them. United spokeswoman Christen David said Wednesday evening that the airline would comply with the order ""and will work closely with the FAA and Boeing on the technical review."" The FAA noted that its directive also signals international aviation authorities to take ""parallel action"" regarding their own airlines. The first commercial Dreamliner flight took off in October 2011, flying from Tokyo to Hong Kong, and the planes flew without major problems for more than a year. Since July, the growing list of reported troubles aboard the planes include a fuel leak, an oil leak, two cracked engines, a damaged cockpit window and a battery problem. The FAA announced a safety review of the aircraft last week. In the most serious incident so far, an All Nippon Airlines (ANA) 787 with 129 people aboard made an emergency landing after a battery alarm Wednesday morning. Those on board reported a burning smell in the cabin, and an alarm indicated smoke in a forward electrical compartment. Hours later, ANA and Japan Airlines announced that they were grounding their Dreamliners pending an investigation. And on Thursday, the Japanese government ordered that all 787s be kept out of service until battery safety could be assured. A maintenance worker discovered an electrical fire aboard an empty Japan Airlines 787 slated for departure from Logan International Airport in Boston on January 7. In a statement released Wednesday night, Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Jim McNerney said the company is confident that the planes are safe and is working with authorities to get them flying again. ""Boeing is committed to supporting the FAA and finding answers as quickly as possible. The company is working around the clock with its customers and the various regulatory and investigative authorities. We will make available the entire resources of The Boeing Company to assist,"" the statement said. ""We are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity. We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787's safety and to return the airplanes to service."" McNerney's statement Wednesday did not mention specifics about the recent incidents, but said the company ""deeply regrets the impact that recent events have had on the operating schedules of our customers and the inconvenience to them and their passengers."" Boeing has delivered 50 Dreamliners so far and has more than 800 additional orders for the aircraft from airlines around the world. On Wednesday night, Chile-based LAN Airlines said it was temporarily grounding its three Boeing 787 aircraft in compliance with the FAA's recommendation. Boeing's shares -- which had previously been resilient in the face of this month's negative publicity over the Dreamliner -- sank 2% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after falling 3.4% during the trading day. After last week's incident in Boston, Boeing chief engineer Mike Sinnett expressed confidence in the aircraft's battery system. ""I am 100% convinced the airplane is safe to fly,"" he said. ""I fly on it all the time."" Asked last week whether he would consider grounding the jets, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said there was ""nothing in the data"" that suggested the Dreamliner was unsafe. Longtime commercial pilot and industry analyst Patrick Smith said the battery issue did not appear to be a major problem, but called the FAA order ""a positive and pro-active step."" ""I don't think that it was dangerous for the plane to be flying, but it probably wasn't the best thing to be flying it on the heels of this latest emergency landing in Japan,"" Smith said. ""All airplanes have their teething problems, and this was trending in a bad direction,"" he added. ""Now the authorities have said, 'Stop,' and that's a good thing."" CNN's Mike M. Ahlers and Thom Patterson and CNNMoney contributed to this report.","NEW: Japan orders that 787s remain out of service until battery safety is assured .

"(CNN) -- Maurice Sendak, author of the classic children's book ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" has died, a spokeswoman for HarperCollins Publishers said Tuesday. He was 83. Sendak illustrated nearly 100 books during a 65-year career, winning dozens of accolades as he endeared himself to generations of children reared on his fanciful stories. One critic called him ""the Picasso of children's literature."" Former President Bill Clinton called him the ""king of dreams."" He died Tuesday in Danbury, Connecticut, of complications from a recent stroke. Born in Brooklyn the son of Polish immigrants, Sendak grew up to take a few night classes but largely taught himself as an artist. He is best known for ""Where the Wild Things Are."" It tells the story of a boy named Max who dresses in a white wolf costume and escapes his life at home by sailing to a remote land, where he discovers wild things who roar their terrible roars and gnash their terrible teeth. The book stirred controversy when it was first published in 1963. Many librarians initially feared it would disturb children, but it has become a timeless classic well-stocked in bookstores and libraries around the world. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" won the Caldecott Medal in 1964, considered the most prestigious award for illustrated children's books. The book was adapted into a feature-length film in 2009. It was in the news again when President Obama read the story to children at this year's White House Easter egg roll. Sendak also wrote ""In the Night Kitchen,"" ""Chicken Soup with Rice,"" and ""Alligators All Around,"" among many others. In 1970, he won the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration, the only American ever to receive the honor. His entire body of work was recognized with the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, given by the American Library Association. Sendak also received the first Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award in 2003, an international prize for children's literature established by the Swedish government. His books became children's classics, but in an interview with The Atlantic last year, Sendak said he didn't set out to be known as a writer for children. ""I don't know how to do a children's book. I don't even know what a children's book is. I always know that my work is deemed suitable -- more suitable -- for children. I don't believe that, but who cares? Who cares?"" he said. His characters entered worlds ""where you don't have to pretend to be civilized,"" Sendak told The Atlantic about his book ""Bumble-Ardy."" ""Children can distort, and play with figures and ideas, with a fluidity that strains us -- which we grow out of,"" he said. In 1980, Sendak began designing sets and costumes for opera and ballet. According to his publisher, his productions for major houses in the United States and England included Mozart's ""The Magic Flute,"" Tchaikovsky's ""The Nutcracker"" and Humperdinck's ""Hansel and Gretel."" His last book was inspired by his love for his brother, Jack, for whom he illustrated books.

"(CNN) -- Yes, a pope can resign but it hasn't happened for nearly 600 years. The surprising news from Rome Monday leaves the church and the world in unfamiliar, but not entirely uncharted, territory. The last time a pope resigned was in 1415, when Pope Gregory XII resigned during the worst institutional crisis in the church's history. Called the Great Western Schism, there were not only three popes but three colleges of cardinals competing for allegiance. Gregory's heroic stepping down helped the church heal at a critical moment. It is quite likely that Benedict's shocking move will help burnish his reputation in the long run. His papacy has been a bumpy one, marked by poor communication among his Vatican staff, and with the church at large. Certainly his controversial wording about Islam in his speech at Regensburg in 2006 was an example of a scholar pope unable to reach a mass audience, especially when compared to the media maestro John Paul II. All sorts of internal curial squabbling marked what was supposed to be a Roman housecleaning by a German administrator who didn't turn out to be up to that task. Pope Benedict's statement in full . This pope will go down in history in the line of scholar popes more interested in high-end theology than modern evangelism. But that should not be seen as a criticism even though anyone elected after the superstar John Paul II was destined -- perhaps doomed -- to seem smaller compared to such a giant. All eras of church histories have seen different popes for different times, so perhaps what the church needed was a quiet pope after a boisterous papacy. Yet the introverted pope who played Mozart seemed unable to hit the right note when it came to addressing the major issue of the last decade: The priest sex abuse scandal and the related problem of bishops who protected predators. This makes for a decidedly mixed verdict -- at least today. CNN iReport: What do you think? The precedents to his surprise move are few.The first pope to resign was Pontian, in 235, when Christianity was still an illegal religion in the Roman Empire. He was deported from Rome to Sardinia to a prison known for its brutality. Since he knew he would die there, he resigned so a successor would be in place. The pope's German roots . The most famous resignation is Celestine V in 1294. A hermit, totally unsuited to the politics of the medieval papal court, he resigned after less than half a year in office. Dante famously put Celestine at the gates of hell for his ""great refusal"" or, in Italian, il gran rifiuto. So why is Pope Benedict resigning? It seems, like Celestine V and maybe even Paul VI, that Benedict was never quite comfortable as pope. It could be that this very traditional man is setting a helpful precedent for modern medical times, and making papal resignations easier in the future due to ill health. Benedict may have simply come to the moment where he realized he couldn't do the job any more. Unlike John Paul II, who decided to stay in the job, Benedict is offering a different model. Pope Benedict will surely retire quietly to a Benedictine monastery to keep writing, the life he imagined for himself before his election. Abuse mars legacy . The question now is what authority does have an ex-pope have. When he renounces the papal throne, he no longer has papal authority. Joseph Ratzinger must be very careful not to interfere or to answer the inevitable phone calls when his successor makes a move that appears different from the one he would have made. To interfere would be out of character, so it seems likely that this careful theologian and prototypical company man will go gently into that good night. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Bellitto .","Pope Benedict's resignation leaves the church and the world in unfamiliar, but not entirely uncharted, territory .

"(CNN) -- A volcano erupted Thursday in Guatemala, prompting officials to evacuate 35,000 residents, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross told CNN. The ""Volcan de Fuego,"" or Fire Volcano, began spewing ash at 10 a.m. and was continuing to belch forth late in the afternoon near the country's former capital, Antigua, said Carmen Maria Caballero of the Guatemalan Red Cross. CNN iReporter Harby David Marroquin had been working at a nearby golf course when he saw nature's pyrotechnics and shot video on his iPhone. It showed white smoke pouring out of the top of the 3,763-meter (12,346-foot) volcano. Listening to the volcano gives him peace of mind, Marroquin said. ""You feel an indescribable energy, and this time was no different."" iReport: Are you there? Send us your photos, videos . Ten shelters, each able to house some 200 people, were opened in the affected villages, Caballero said. Most evacuees were staying with friends or relatives, she said. Residents within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the volcano were being taken from the affected zone in buses and private cars, she said. Ash was falling up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the volcano. Several people were treated at mobile health centers for respiratory problems; one person was hospitalized in critical condition, according to Caballero. Another Red Cross spokesman, Vinicio Sarazua Santillan, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol that a number of people were remaining in their houses, unwilling to evacuate out of fear that their belongings could be stolen. Thursday's eruption marked the sixth -- and the strongest -- this year, she said. ""It's a very active volcano,"" she added, but said that that did not necessarily mean Thursday's eruption would last longer than others. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the volcano is one of Central America's most active. Volcano erupts in another Central American country .

"(CNN) -- Energy giant BP will hold a worldwide moment of silence Wednesday for the victims of last week's hostage crisis at an Algerian gas plant, with its CEO saying employees ""fear the worst"" for four colleagues still missing. Nearly a week after Islamic militants seized the In Amenas facility in the Sahara Desert, families and governments around the world were waiting for the Algerian government to provide a full accounting of the dead and missing. Algerian authorities say five workers are still missing after its special forces stormed the compound in a bloody weekend raid that left most of the terrorists and their remaining captives dead. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . The plant is run by Algeria's state oil company, in cooperation with foreign firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP. Tuesday night, BP CEO Bob Dudley said four of its 18 employees at the plant remain unaccounted for, and ""It is with great sadness that I now have to say that we fear the worst for them all."" The company said its offices worldwide will hold a minute of silence Wednesday ""as a mark of respect for all of those who lost their lives at In Amenas."" At least 37 hostages were killed in the four-day ordeal, which began December 16 and ended Saturday. ""Many of us have friends and colleagues, both in BP and in other companies, who have worked at In Amenas or in similar facilities,"" Dudley said in a company statement. ""We are all thinking of our missing colleagues, those who endured the ordeal and their loved ones."" The plant employed about 790 people, including 134 foreign workers -- among them Victor Lovelady, one of three Americans known to have been killed. Family members said Lovelady, ever the family man, was excited about the job. He got 28 days off for every 28 days he put in, time he could spend with his wife and two children in Nederland, Texas. Yes, it was in a remote natural gas facility in Algeria, but Lovelady assured his family it was safe. And it was in Africa, a place the 57-year-old seemed to love. ""He felt something there,"" his daughter, Erin, told reporters Tuesday. ""He was so excited to go there. I don't really know why, but he just loved it."" But 10 days after he returned to the complex from a visit home, terrorists sped in on pickups, overtook the compound and made hostages of its workers. ""It's just unfair,"" Lovelady's brother, Mike Lovelady, said Tuesday. ""My brother didn't deserve to die."" In addition to Lovelady, Americans Gordon Lee Rowan and Frederick Buttaccio also died. Seven U.S. citizens survived the crisis, the State Department said. It did not elaborate, citing privacy concerns. Like Lovelady, Rowan, too, felt safe working there. He said ""we're in a compound in the middle of nowhere, and we've got security, and I'll be fine,"" Rowan's former neighbor, Gwen Eckholm, told CNN affiliate KNXV-TV in Phoenix. ""I guess you can't really be secure any place."" Opinion: Algeria hostage crisis shows jihadists on rise . Meanwhile, Algerian authorities hailed as a hero the only one of their compatriots among the hostages who died in the attack. While few details about his contribution were available Tuesday, Algerian authorities said he had raised the alarm that allowed plant workers to shut down operations and go into hiding. Militants shot the man between the eyes just as he alerted plant workers of the attack, Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal said. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the North African branch of the terrorist movement, has claimed responsibility for the attack. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that U.S. officials ""don't have any reason to doubt"" the group's involvement. Nuland said Washington has no reason to believe any Americans are among those still unaccounted for. Algeria said the attack was retaliation for its decision to let France to use its airspace for an offensive against Islamist militants in neighboring Mali. But regional analysts said that would appear to be unlikely; the operation was too sophisticated to have been planned in the few days between France's intervention in Mali and the attack on the gas plant less than a week later. The Algerian government has said the attackers came from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Mali, Niger, Canada and Mauritania. U.S. and Algerian officials are still trying to confirm the identities of those involved, according to a federal law enforcement official -- and it was unclear whether the terrorist identified as a Canadian was carrying authentic or false identification. ""The level of co-operation between two countries has been good,"" the official added. The FBI has additional investigators in Algeria, where there is an established legal attache office, but authorities declined to say how many agents are there or identify their location. KBMT: Family seeks answers after Nederland man killed in Algeria . Algerian officials said the attackers drew on the expertise of a driver from Niger who had once worked at the plant. One former hostage, Mohadmed Aziri, told state-run Chinese broadcaster CCTV about militants flooding into the compound, taking it over bit by bit, searching door to door for workers. He also described rescue efforts. ""The experience was too terrible. I heard the sounds of gunshot, bullets hitting doors,"" he told CCTV. ""I heard the governmental forces and terrorists fighting in the distance. Judging from the sounds of gunfire, the fighting was very intense."" The Algerians initially moved in on Thursday after concluding the militants planned to blow up the gas installation and flee to Mali with the foreigners as hostages. The incursion succeeded in freeing some hostages -- but not all -- and several of them died. Lovelady survived Thursday's raid. And if his family knew him at all, he was likely biding his time, coolly trying to find a way to help himself and others out of the unthinkable predicament they found themselves in. 'We felt in our hearts that he was coming home' ""He wouldn't be the person who is crying and screaming and begging,"" Erin Lovelady said. And after the initial exhilarating news, the family felt sure he would pull through. ""We all believed, we felt in our hearts that he was coming home,"" his daughter said. But then, on Saturday, Algerian special forces backed by helicopter gunships raided the plant for a second time. They finished off the militants but were unable to save the remaining hostages. Militants may have executed them, Mike Lovelady said he'd been told. The news, Erin Lovelady said, was ""devastating."" Bloody Algeria hostage crisis ends after 'final' assault . Mike Lovelady said he's angry with the terrorists who took the compound his brother thought was safe, resulting in the deaths of people who had traveled there merely to make a better living for their families. But he said things maybe could have been different had Algeria allowed U.S. or British special operations forces to take over. Maybe, Mike Lovelady said, the U.S. Navy SEALs or Britain's Special Air Service commandos could have taken out the militants while sparing the hostages. ""We all feel it could have been handled differently,"" he said. However, Algeria's Interior Ministry said security forces were compelled to intervene quickly ""to avoid a bloody turning point of events in this extremely dangerous situation."" Officials said Monday that had the terrorists succeeded in blowing up the plant, it would have caused death and destruction in a 5-kilometer (3.1 mile) radius. On Tuesday, U.S. officials reiterated their support for Algerian officials. ""The blame for this tragedy rests with the terrorists who carried it out,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Nations scramble to account for missing after Algeria hostage crisis . As the family awaits the return of Lovelady's body, and more answers about how he died, Mike Lovelady said he's determined not to let his brother's legacy die with him. He said he intends to press Congress to keep up the fight against terrorism. ""I'll be angry for a long time,"" he said. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Susan Candiotti, Ross Levitt, Yoko Wakatsuki, Hamdi Alkhshali, Greg Botelho and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","BP says four of its workers remain unaccounted for, and ""we fear the worst""

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican author Carlos Fuentes, a prolific writer known for his novels and political commentary, died Tuesday. He was 83. Fuentes had a massive hemorrhage overnight, said Dr. Arturo Ballesteros, his doctor. He died Tuesday afternoon, hours after arriving at the hospital. ""I deeply regret the passing of our beloved and admired Carlos Fuentes, writer and universal Mexican. May he rest in peace,"" Mexican President Felipe Calderon said in a Twitter post. Mexico's national arts council described Fuentes as ""one of the most prolific and recognized Mexican authors in the world."" He won numerous literary awards throughout his career, including the Cervantes Prize. On Monday, Spain's University of the Balearic Islands awarded him an honorary doctorate for his literary work. Fuentes, the son of a diplomat, was born in Panama and spent parts of his childhood in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and the United States. As he received the Cervantes Prize in 1987, he described Mexico as ""the country of my blood and also of my imagination."" His first novels, which included ""The Most Transparent Region"" in 1959 and ""The Death of Artemio Cruz"" in 1962, made him one of the most important figures of the so-called Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s. His 1985 novel ""Old Gringo"" was a bestseller in the United States. It became a movie in 1989 starring Gregory Peck and Jane Fonda. ""Carlos' influence on literature goes far beyond borders of Latin America, and the impact of his intellect and activism will not be forgotten,"" said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who presented Fuentes with a key to the city in 2006. In a recent interview with Spain's El Pais newspaper, the author discussed his plans to write a new book. ""My technique for staying young is working a lot, and always having a pending project. Now I've finished a book, 'Federico on His Balcony,' but now I have a new one, 'The Dance of the Centenarian,' that I start to write Monday in Mexico,"" Fuentes said in the interview, which was published this week. Fuentes, a former ambassador to France who became known as much for his political commentary as his literary prowess, regularly wrote columns for the Spanish newspaper and the Mexico daily Reforma. On Tuesday, Reforma published a column by Fuentes titled ""Long live socialism. But..."" analyzing the recent election of Francois Hollande to France's presidency. At the Buenos Aires Book Fair earlier this month, Fuentes spoke of the problem of drug trafficking in Latin America and criticized the candidates running for president in Mexico this year. ""What alarms me enormously this year ... is that I see problems here, and the candidates there,"" Fuentes told CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Carmen Aristegui in January.

"(CNN) -- Police said Tuesday they are looking for a woman in connection to a fatal shooting and crash on the Las Vegas Strip that left three people dead. They are calling 22-year-old Tineesha Lashun Howard, aka Yenesis Alfonso, a ""person of interest."" ""She's not considered a suspect,"" said Laura Meltzer, a spokeswoman with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. ""She's somebody detectives would like to speak to in connection with this event."" Police say Howard has been identified as being inside a black Range Rover at the time shots were fired from the vehicle. She was described by police as 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing around 120 pounds and having green eyes and dark hair. She is listed as a missing and possibly endangered person from the Miami area. ""This case needs to be solved,"" Meltzer said, urging Howard to come forward. Police had previously identified Ammar Asim Faruq Harris, 26, as a suspect in the shooting. He is at large, though a black Range Rover police say he was driving early Thursday morning has been impounded. Police consider Harris to be armed and dangerous and say he has an extensive criminal history, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. He has several tattoos, including a small heart -shaped one below his right eye and a large one of an owl that covers his neck and part of his chest. A woman who said she is Howard's mother told CNN that her daughter and Harris have been girlfriend and boyfriend for about a year. Miladys Garcia said she recognized Harris from an image that police issued but that she knew him by a different name. Garcia said she hasn't been in contact with her daughter since the shooting. She provided CNN with a phone number for Howard, who she said was 21 years old, not 22. A call Tuesday went straight to voice mail, and the mailbox was full. Police have released several photographs of Howard and Harris. They pose together in some; one is identical to the Facebook profile picture of a woman identified as ""Yeni Alfonso."" That page says she is from Naranja, Florida, attended Homestead High School in Homestead, Florida, works as an entertainer at Playmates Cabaret and lives in Las Vegas. A man identified as Emilio Alfonso has posted two messages on her page since Sunday. ""Yeny, call me now,"" read one in Spanish. ""You've got me worried. Call me. You are very important. Everything has a solution,"" read the other, also in Spanish. In the shooting and crash, Kenneth Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch, was driving his Maserati around 4:20 a.m. Thursday when someone in a Range Rover shot at his car as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard. Cherry, who was shot in the chest and arm, later died at a hospital. The Maserati continued into the intersection with Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, CNN affiliate KVVU said. A passenger in the taxi -- identified by the Clark County coroner's office as Sandra Sutton-Wasmund, 48, of Maple Valley, Washington -- also died. Her death and the deaths of Boldon and Cherry have been ruled homicides, according to the coroner's office. The fire closed a block and a half of the Strip near some of its biggest draws: Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's and the Flamingo. Police collected surveillance video from the casinos.

"(CNN) -- Legendary singer Andy Williams, known for his smooth voice and classics such as ""Moon River,"" died after a year-long battle with bladder cancer at his Branson, Missouri, home Tuesday night, his family said. Williams, 84, began his singing career as a child in a quartet with his brothers, but he rose to stardom as a solo act starting in the 1950s. ""The Andy Williams Show,"" a weekly television variety program that ran for nine years on NBC starting in 1962, and a dozen TV specials from 1959 through 1987 made Williams a household name in the United States. He spent the last 20 years of his career performing on his own stage at his Moon River Theatre in Branson. Jimmy Osmond said his family would be ""forever grateful for the interactions we had with him."" ""Not only did he discover us as a group, but also allowed us the opportunity to be discovered as individuals and develop our own talents,"" Osmond said. ""The clarity and warmth and grace of his singing shaped my love of music as I watched my brothers perform with him on his weekly show,"" Donny Osmond said. Williams gave him several voice lessons when he was just 7, Osmond said. ""When I finally joined my brothers and toured with Andy as his opening act and back-up singers, I was always impressed with the way he handled an audience,"" he said. ""He loved the audience. That was one of the most important lessons he taught me."" His sister, Marie Osmond, who made her TV debut on his show at age 3, said Williams was ""the first person to affect my career."" ""The group 'The Osmonds' would not exist without the foresight and generosity of our mentor Andy Williams,"" Marie Osmond said. ""No one sang more beautifully than Andy Williams,"" she said. ""Hearing his version of 'Moon River' never failed to move me deeply. I can't imagine the holiday season without Andy Williams; we did so many specials together."" People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived . ""Moon River"" became his theme song after he performed it at the 1962 Academy Awards, where it won an Oscar for best song in a movie. Audrey Hepburn sang the Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini composition in the film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" Williams' recording career reached superstar status in 1963 when his album ""Days of Wine and Roses"" spent 16 weeks at the top of the U.S. music charts. His variety TV show, which promoted the careers of many other artists including the Osmonds, won high ratings and three Emmys. Singer Ray Stevens, who was managed for years by Andy's brother Don, called him ""one classy guy."" ""He was a marvelously talented and generous performer who in 1970 entrusted his nationally acclaimed TV show and audience to a green kid from Georgia,"" Stevens said. ""That kid was me, and he changed my life."" Williams hosted the first live Grammy Awards telecast at the Hollywood Palladium in 1971. He went on to host for seven years straight. ""The entertainment industry has lost a giant piece of its living history today, but Williams' legacy will forever be enshrined in the annals of music and television,"" said Neil Portnow, the president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. ""Our deepest condolences go out to his family, friends, and all who will miss this American treasure."" The singer hosted five Christmas television specials, between 1973 and 1985, along with seven other television specials, the first in 1959 and the last in 1987. Williams, who also had a home in La Quinta, California, is survived by his wife of 21 years, Debbie, and his three children with French singer Claudine Longet -- Robert, Noelle and Christian. He was married to Longet from 1961 until their divorce in 1975. A year later, she was charged with the fatal shooting of her boyfriend, Olympic skier Spider Sabich. Williams stood by Longet, who claimed the shooting was accidental. She spent a month in jail. Williams' Branson theater was the first non-country venue built in the small Missouri tourist mecca. Rare photo of Williams Christmas party: 'He was Christmas in Branson' He was born on December 3, 1927, in Wall Lake, Iowa, where he began singing with brothers Bob, Dick and Don in a Presbyterian church choir led by their parents. Williams was just 8 when he made his professional singing debut with the Williams Brothers Quartet. The brothers were regular performers on radio station WHO's ""Iowa's Barn Dance Show"" in Des Moines. Their popularity grew, taking the brothers to national stations, including WLS in Chicago and WLW in Cincinnati. Doris Day was his friend when they were both young and living in Cincinnati. ""He and his brothers sang and, of course, so did I, and often I would go over to their house and we would sing together,"" Day said Wednesday. ""They asked me to join their group, but my vocal coach thought I should be out on my own, and so that's what I did."" Smokey Robinson said Williams ""befriended me when I was just a teenager starting out in show business, and we remained friends throughout the years."" ""I regret that we didn't have the chance to spend more time together,"" Robinson said. ""He was one of the great voices and great people of our time.""

"(CNN) -- If laughter is the best medicine then few are more qualified to offer a prescription than Riaad Moosa. The South African comic-turned-movie-actor is a fully trained doctor, but it's his Indian heritage and Muslim faith that provide the basis for his stand-up material. ""I'm a comedian who happens to be Muslim [and] my comedy stems on all forms of my identity,"" he says. Moosa came to prominence on the comedy-club circuit of his native Cape Town around the turn of the century and became known for poking fun at Islamic stereotypes. He believes this serves to highlight the prejudices many people have developed about Muslims due to fears of terrorism or violent extremism. ""When I started out it was around the whole 9/11, Islamophobia was just sort of hitting a second wind,"" he says. ""Obviously that informed a lot of my humor and it influenced a lot of what I was talking about on stage because it was extremely relevant at the time. ""I would just speak about how people perceived Muslims and how scared they are of Muslims."" See also: South African comic duo stir up stereotypes . Moosa however says that Islam is a religion which is tolerant and open to comedy, especially in South Africa. ""I'm sure in certain parts of the world it still sounds a bit strange [being a Muslim comedian],"" he says. ""In the Cape, in fact, it's completely the opposite. The Muslims in the Cape are associated with having a very good sense of humor."" Moosa has been known to crack jokes on the death of Osama bin Laden and European perceptions of Islam. In one routine he jokes: ""Europeans ridicule Muslim culture because they don't understand the wisdom behind it. Take swine flu for instance: all the sudden you've got Europeans scared of pigs -- we've been saying that for years!"" Watch video: Riaad Moosa, doctor turned comedian . Moosa describes such gags as ""hard jokes"" but says he should able to extract humor from every aspect of his life. He draws a line however at insulting or demeaning his religious beliefs. ""I would never want to disrespect my beliefs,"" he says. ""There are certain, obviously different, areas you wouldn't go. It's not congruent to who I am as a person and it would be insincere and it wouldn't be based on truth."" Despite being a natural comedian, Moosa says he always wanted to be a doctor. ""Both my parents are doctors, so from the time I was a child I wanted to do medicine,"" he says. ""It just so happened that I also had this other talent for making voices -- that's how my mom put it -- I used to always impersonate people."" Having qualified as a doctor, Moosa admits that his new career is something of a departure. ""It's a very different type of work -- I mean, I never got applause with the medicine. I never got: 'That's an amazing prostate exam doctor, do you have any DVDs of your prostate exams?'"" Moosa's latest film project, Material, has already been released in South Africa. In the movie he plays an aspiring young Muslim comedian challenging his family's expectations of what it means to be successful in modern South Africa. In many ways, Material has more than a whiff of Moosa's own life-story about it. He has been heavily involved throughout the project, helping write the script, being cast in the starring roll and even having a financial stake in the film. ""The challenges that I have of being a South African comedian as a Muslim ... does get dramatized in the story,"" he says. ""It's not specifically my story because my family is very supportive. There was no moment where I had to challenge my parents specifically to try and achieve my dream, which is what happens in the movie."" Moosa hopes the underlying themes portrayed in the film of an underdog fighting against the odds and tradition will make it a hit outside South Africa. See also: Muslim comedian branches out . Like his comedic routines, Moosa has tried to create a piece of art that will resonate with his audience on multiple levels. He says there are plans to take the film to India and the Middle East and has already visited London to promote the movie at the 2012 BFI London Film Festival. He adds: ""It is a universal tale and I think many communities or people around the world will connect with that story. ""That's the trick, to not make it a South African story but a story about an ordinary person trying to follow their dreams.""","Riaad Moosa is a comedian, movie star and a qualified doctor .

"(CNN) -- Simba Makoni, the former Zimbabwean finance minister and presidential candidate in the country's last elections, describes himself as ""an eternal optimist."" ""I believe those of us who don't see a half-empty glass but a half-full glass will prevail over those of us who want to keep us stuck in the past,"" he said reassuringly as he concluded his speech Tuesday at a Royal African Society event in the UK entitled ""Whither Zimbabwe?"" Yet, Makoni's optimism-filled end remarks could do little to lift the gloom that had descended upon the packed room moments ago while he was describing life in today's Zimbabwe. ""Surviving is very difficult on a daily basis,"" Makoni, founder and president of the Mavambo.Kusile.Dawn party, had told earlier the crowd of analysts, activists and members of the diaspora gathered at London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). Unemployment is soaring, he said, and acute food shortages threaten vulnerable parts of the population with starvation. Schools are short of books and hospitals often lack the most basic supplies -- just a few days ago, he said, a hospital in Harare was left without running water. ""This is why all our leaders when they're falling ill they leave the country and go for treatment in Thailand, in Singapore, in Malaysia, in the UK and the rest of us must die,"" he said. Read related: Inside Zimbabwe's controversial Marange diamond field . A former member of Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, Makoni first joined Zimbabwe's government in 1980, the year the southern African country gained its independence from Great Britain. He served as a deputy minister of agriculture before leading the industry and energy development. During his tenure as finance minister in the 2000s, Makoni backed the devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar and faced strong opposition as some of his policies contradicted the rest of ZANU-PF. He left the party in 2008 to run for president against Mugabe, garnering 8.3% of the vote in that year's controversial elections. Makoni's speech at SOAS was billed as a conversation ""on issues in contemporary Zimbabwean politics."" Yet, it felt more like the launch of a new presidential campaign. Makoni blamed Zimbabwe's unity government for failing to meet people's expectations and regenerate the economy in a country beset by widespread poverty. ""The people of Zimbabwe are thoroughly disgruntled with the inclusive government and they would like the shortest opportunity to be rid of [it],"" he said. Zimbabwe has been ruled by a fragile power-sharing government cobbled together after 2008's disputed elections prompted months of violence that paralyzed the country. Under the deal, ZANU-PF leader Robert Mugabe remained president while his political foe, Morgan Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC-T), became prime minister. Third party leader Arthur Mutambara was named deputy prime minister. Yet, tensions have always remained high within the coalition. Its two main parties quickly formed polarized political camps, quarreling publicly on a number of issues, including the draft of a new constitution. After many disagreements about the date of the next vote, Zimbabwe is now expected to go to polls within a year. Makoni said that Zimbabweans ""are yearning for elections the soonest"" but are also ""fearful of the violence"" that had engulfed past votes. ""They would like assurances that that election would be free and fair, without violence and intimidation."" He noted, however, that Zimbabwe does not need a new constitution to hold free and fair elections. In principle, Makoni said, the existing law and institutions such as the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission are adequate: ""If we put the right people in it but more importantly if we take out the wrong people who are in it at the moment."" Read: Zimbabwe 'open for business' Last month, a Freedom House survey said that support for Tsvangirai's party fell from 38% to 20% in the last two years, while Mugabe's ZANU-PF grew from 17% to 31% in the same period. But also in August, a survey by Afrobarometer described a different picture, giving ZANU-PF 32% and MDC-T 31%. Presented with these figures, which show that 2013's elections will be once again a contest between Mugabe and Tsvangirai, Makoni was quick to stress that 47% of the respondents in the Freedom House survey did not disclose their voting preferences. ""That is the most significant for me,"" he said. ""For me and for others who are not in that global political agreement that is our target constituent because whoever gets half of that 47% is the person who will make the government of Zimbabwe the next time around."" Mugabe, who's been in power for 32 years, has blamed many of his country's economic woes on the sanctions, imposed by the United States and the European Union in 2002. But Makoni argued that the sanctions, which include travel bans, and freezing of assets, were not affecting ordinary people. Instead, he said, the measures are aimed at Mugabe and his allies. ""These are targeted measures against individuals who are perceived to perpetuate the violation of human rights,"" said Makoni, who was also subject to the EU travel ban in the 2000s as a member of Mugabe's regime. Trade between Zimbabwe and the EU grew by almost 50% in the last 12 months, Makoni said. Nearly all of the country's platinum production and most of its tobacco is heading to the northwestern hemisphere, he added. ""These things don't happen in a country that is under sanctions, particularly trade and economic sanctions,"" he said. ""Now, if barring Robert Mugabe and Grace Mugabe coming to London to shop at Harrods are sanctions against Zimbabwe, you will have to make a new definition of sanctions."" Looking toward the upcoming vote, Mokani said that his party has already began conversations in Zimbabwe to bring together other political groups and patriotic Zimbabweans who can help the country escape its hardship. Not surprisingly, he said was hopeful about the Zimbabwe of tomorrow -- the people's resilient spirit and skills, coupled with a better management of Zimbabwe's natural resources, will all contribute to the country's resurgence, he said. ""There is a silver lining around this dark cloud hovering over Zimbabwe,"" declared Makoni. ""The future of Zimbabwe is bright."" And when asked about who was going to win the next elections, Makoni, as optimistic as ever, replied: ""Simba Makoni.""","Simba Makoni is a Zimbabwean politician who ran for president in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Jimmy Ellis, who belted out the dance anthem ""Disco Inferno"" in the 1970s for the Trammps, died Thursday in South Carolina, the funeral home handling arrangements said. He was 74. Ellis' rich baritone powered the funky Grammy-winning tune from the ""Saturday Night Fever"" album. It is only second to ""The Bodyguard"" as the best-selling soundtrack album of all time with sales of 15 million. Despite the success associated with the hit movie, Ellis and the band couldn't translate it into mainstream appeal, scoring just three R&B Top 10 hits from 1972 to 1978. But the group still commanded respect in the music community. ""But the Trammps' prowess can't be measured by chart popularity. Ellis' booming, joyous vocals brilliantly championed the celebratory fervor and atmosphere that made disco both loved and hated among music fans,"" the group's biography on allmusic.com says.

"(CNN) -- California horse-racing authorities handed the trainer of Triple Crown hopeful I'll Have Another a 45-day suspension Thursday stemming from a 2010 race with another horse, but cleared him of giving that horse an energy-boosting cocktail. The suspension won't take effect until at least July 1, meaning trainer Doug O'Neill will be able to participate in the June 9 Belmont Stakes -- when Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner I'll Have Another is carrying high hopes for the sport's first Triple Crown since 1978. And the California Horse Racing Board's decision explicitly cleared O'Neill of ""milkshaking"" the throughbred Argenta during a race at southern California's Del Mar track in September 2010. The board did find O'Neill, as Argenta's trainer, was responsible for high total carbon dioxide levels found in its blood -- a sign a horse might have been given a ""milkshake"" of baking soda, electrolytes and sugar believed to help it combat fatigue. It fined him $15,000, and said another 135 days of suspension could be applied if O'Neill is found to have violated other rules in any jurisdiction. But a state hearing officer found no sign of any ""intentional acts"" on the part of the trainer or any sign that betting on the race had been skewed toward Argenta, which finished well out of the money in eighth place. O'Neill can challenge the finding in court, but his brother, Dennis O'Neill, said no decision has been made on how to proceed. ""We're just ecstatic that the judge ruled we didn't do anything to make the TCO2 (total carbon dioxide) level go up,"" Dennis O'Neill told CNN. But he said there was ""absolutely"" no doubt his brother would be able to take part in the Belmont, in New York. ""We're very happy that the press release is very clear that Doug never milkshaked the horse, and there was no suspicious betting pattern,"" he added. Lee Park, a spokesman for the New York State Racing and Wagering Board, said that agency would review California's decision. But since the suspension won't take effect until July, ""it should have no bearing on the June 9 Belmont Stakes,"" he said. The 2010 allegation isn't the first scrape O'Neill has had with California regulators. In 2007, he was fined $3,000 after another horse showed high carbon dioxide levels. And in 2010, the Illinois Racing Board suspended him for 15 days when another horse showed high blood CO2 levels; California's racing board issued him a matching suspension. But there have been no allegations that O'Neill had given a milkshake to I'll Have Another. And his brother told CNN earlier this week that ""We've never milkshaked a horse."" ""We wouldn't know how to do it,"" Dennis O""Neill said. ""It's never been done by us or anybody in the barn.""","NEW: California action won't affect upcoming Belmont Stakes, New York official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Retired Justice John Paul Stevens had harsh words for his former conservative colleagues Wednesday, saying they have inconsistently applied the law two years after a sweeping ruling dealing with campaign finance reform. That controversial decision, known as Citizens United, gave corporations -- individuals, unions, businesses and advocacy groups -- greater power to spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose federal election candidates. Stevens issued a bitter dissent in that case, months before stepping down from the high court after 35 years on the bench. He said Congress had long imposed reasonable limits on corporate spending as a way to curb the potentially corrupting influence by the wealthy, whose voices would be heard above those of others in the crowded political landscape. Stevens, at an evening speech at the University of Arkansas, said the five conservatives who gave corporations greater power in the name of free speech may now be rethinking, even regretting, their decision, based on related cases since that 2010 decision. In particular, he noted the Citizens United decision, which struck down the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law, said the First Amendment ""generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker's identity."" The 92-year-old former justice said the court will soon have to confront the question of whether the ruling applies to the ability of foreign corporations, potentially even terror groups, to spend freely. He predicted the justices would decide it does not. ""The court must then explain its abandonment of, or at least qualify reliance upon, the proposition that the identity of the speaker is an impermissible basis for regulating campaign speech,"" he told the audience. ""It will be necessary to explain why the First Amendment provides greater protection for some nonvoters than that of other nonvoters. He said American corporations, unlike individuals, were in that broad category of nonvoters. Stevens predicted creating an exception for the foreign corporations ""will create a crack in the foundation of the Citizens United majority"" led by the conservatives under Chief Justice John Roberts. President Obama, just days after the Citizens United opinion, said in his State of the Union address that it would ""open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limits in our elections."" Justice Samuel Alito, named to the court by President Bush in 2006, was in the audience at the time and famously mouthed the words ""not true"" to Obama's remarks. But Stevens said that while he has not talked with Alito about it, the mouthed words indicated ""there will not be five votes"" to sustain a majority if and when the court confronts the foreign spending question. Stevens also noted time and logic has borne out the president's warnings. The high court earlier this year upheld a lower court ruling preventing noncitizens from contributing to federal political candidates. That, said Stevens, showed the justices clearly believe ""the identity of some speakers may provide a legally acceptable basis for restricting speech"" in election contributions. ""I think it likely when the court begins to spell out which categories of nonvoters should receive the same protections"" enjoyed by U.S. corporations, ""It will not only exclude terrorist organizations and foreign agents, but also all corporations owned or controlled by noncitizens, and possibly even those in which noncitizens have a substantial ownership interest."" Stevens' pointed remarks come in the midst of a presidential campaign season that is already breaking records for spending by outside groups, many of them so-called super PACs now unencumbered by previous spending limits. The justice on Tuesday received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Obama in a White House ceremony. The president praised Stevens for his independent, rigorous approach to the law, ""favoring a pragmatic solution over an ideological one."" Critics of Stevens said he had abandoned his earlier conservative leanings to become a liberal on the high court. In his retirement, Stevens has been outspoken about his former colleagues, criticizing rulings issued before and after he left the court.","Retired Justice John Paul Stevens shares thoughts in University of Arkansas speech .

"(CNN) -- The California Senate passed Wednesday a bill that would regulate therapies that purport to be able to change a child's sexual orientation -- from gay to straight. ""The entire medical community is opposed to these phony therapies,"" Sen. Ted W. Lieu, D-Torrance, said after passage of Senate Bill 1172, which he introduced. SB 1172 would prohibit children younger than 18 from undergoing sexual orientation change efforts. CNN.com blogs: Gay in America . ""Being lesbian or gay or bisexual is not a disease or mental disorder for the same reason that being a heterosexual is not a disease or a mental disorder,"" Lieu said in a news release. ""The medical community is unanimous in stating that homosexuality is not a medical condition."" The bill is expected to go to the Assembly for an initial policy review next month. In a telephone interview, the director of communications for Equality California, called the bill's passage ""long past overdue."" ""The California legislature has taken the right first step in making sure that young people are protected from these unscrupulous therapists who are really engaging in therapeutic deception that is based on junk science,"" said Rebekah Orr, whose group took the bill to Lieu. Privacy laws make it difficult to estimate the number of people who have undergone such practices, ""but we certainly know it's not an uncommon experience,"" she said. ""We hear regularly from survivors of these programs who nearly universally were driven near the point of suicide before they were finally able to escape the program and start to heal,"" she said. The president of an organization that promotes reparative therapy, the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality, called the bill ""another triumph of political activism over objective science."" ""In NARTH's view, a truly scientific response would call for more and better research to answer these questions, not a legislative ban that runs roughshod over professional judgment and parental choice,"" said Christopher Rosik, a psychologist. But Peter Drake, who participated in one such program, backed the Senate's move as a way of protecting youths from ""a very very dangerous therapy that doesn't work and leaves a lot of people feeling despair and hopelessness."" Drake said he was in a straight marriage for 28 years and had two children before he came out. ""I was always faithful to my wife but I was always struggling,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""After many years of struggling and hoping it would go away and it didn't, I heard about reparative therapy."" Couples challenge Illinois law denying same-sex marriage . After three years in the therapy, ""there was absolutely no change in my sexual orientation,"" he said. Instead, he felt ""despair, embarrassment and I became depressed really."" Only after he abandoned reparative therapy and entered more traditional therapy did he improve, he said. ""I have always been a gay man and I just had a hard time accepting it."" His wife and children have been supportive, he said. James Guay began the therapy at age 16. ""I volunteered for it, and it was still incredibly damaging,"" he said. ""It created a lot of pain and havoc and emotional turmoil that this bill hopes to prevent."" Guay, now a 40-year-old marriage and family therapist in private practice in Beverly Hills, said he spent years trying to become straight. ""It didn't work,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""When the reality sinks in that there has been no intrinsic change in romantic and love attraction, then we carry the burden: Oh, there's something wrong with me. That's where a lot of the damage can be done."" At age 20, Guay finally gave up his effort to change. ""I met my first boyfriend,"" he said. ""That kind of shined the light on the fact that, oh, wow, this feels very natural, feels very right, does not feel like this wicked, evil sinful kind of thing that I was told that it was."" Orr predicted the bill would pass the assembly, but said her group has work to do to ensure that happens. ""The reality is that a lot of folks don't really know much about this,"" she said. ""So we have education work to do."" Wednesday's 23-13 party line vote came a few weeks after psychiatrist Robert L. Spitzer, in a letter to the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior, apologized for his 2003 study of reparative therapy, which suggested that it could help gays and lesbians become straight. In his study, he asked 200 participants to describe their changes in sexual orientation; most said they had become mostly or exclusively heterosexual. But the study was deeply flawed, Spitzer concluded nearly a decade after its publication. ""I offered several (unconvincing) reasons why it was reasonable to assume that the participants' reports of change were credible and not self-deception or outright lying,"" he wrote. ""But the simple fact is that there was no way to determine if the participants' accounts of change were valid. ""I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy. I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some 'highly motivated' individuals."" ""Everyone agrees that this quackery needs to stop,"" Lieu said in the news release. He predicted that approval of his patient protection plan ""will help raise public awareness of bogus and unethical therapies by mental health providers who promise to change a person's sexual orientation."" He added that recent testimony during policy committee reviews had shown that ""These non-scientific efforts have led in some cases to patients later committing suicide, as well as severe mental and physical anguish.""","The bill would prohibit children from undergoing sexual orientation change efforts .

"(CNN) -- At an immigration reform event in Riverside, California, about a year-and-a-half ago, a man approached attorney Hadley Bajramovic pleading for help. The man was a Mexican immigrant who had been living in the United States illegally for several years. He was also deaf. He abandoned Mexico to flee what he called persecution. He said he was socially ostracized, targeted by police. The abuse was too much to bear. So now he was in California, and had already been ripped off once as he tried to seek asylum in the United States. ""He just stole my heart,"" Bajramovic said of the immigrant. It only took that initial short conversation to realize that ""the situation in Mexico is very severe. I realized that there was persecution."" Bajramovic took his case. Then the next week, there were more phone calls to her office from deaf immigrants who had entered the country illegally looking for asylum. As of this week, Bajramovic has had 30 deaf immigrants complete asylum interviews with the pertinent authorities, and has another 30 such clients awaiting their turn. They come from several countries, though the majority are from Mexico. According to Bajramovic, these are the first petitions for asylum by deaf people on the grounds that they are persecuted for their disability. No rulings have been made in any of the novel cases, but critics say that they represent a perversion of the original intent of asylum law. While these types of cases are new, immigrants have long tested the boundaries of what merits persecution for the purposes of remaining legally in the United States. The first asylum application for Bajramovic's deaf clients was filed in June of last year, and it's possible that no decisions will be handed down until all 60 cases have had at least an initial interview. Such cases seek to expand the criteria for who qualifies for asylum, said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an anti-illegal-immigration group. The law ""is being used and abused as a way to game the system,"" he said. Some asylum cases such as these are used to postpone a deportation, he added. No matter how frivolous, he said, it buys time. But Bajramovic says the cases are anything but frivolous. ""I think it's clear,"" she said. ""The law provides for certain groups to ask for protection in the U.S. Disabilities is one of those groups,"" There are five traditional categories covered by U.S. asylum law: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a specific social group. The first hurdle that the majority of her clients face, even before they make their case before an immigration judge for asylum, is an administrative one. All but one of the deaf immigrants has to prove that they qualify to apply, even though a deadline to apply for asylum has passed. The law requires that asylum-seekers file within one year of arriving in the United States. Only one of the 60 immigrants in this case meets that requirement, the attorney said. But there exist exceptional circumstances, and Bajramovic says her clients qualify. There is a lack of advocacy in Mexico, and a lack of communication that resulted in the deaf immigrants not knowing that asylum was an option when they arrived in the United States. Furthermore, she argues, once in the United States, they were preyed upon by scammers and developed a fear of immigration help, she said. The bottom line, she said, is that these people ""escaped their home countries because of persecution."" She listed the conditions they faced back home, such as being denied the right to be properly educated, having no formal language until a later age, and abuse by family and police, she said. Mexico's foreign affairs ministry did not immediately comment on the deaf immigrants' claims when reached by CNN. The United States simply cannot receive every person who is disadvantaged in their home country, Dane said. ""I think the more we push the reasonable boundaries of the definition of asylum, the further we are getting away from its original intent,"" he said. But Stephen Yale-Loehr, an asylum law expert at Cornell University Law School, said that the boundaries of asylum law have always been a busy place for novel claims. ""I don't think there's a bigger trend. People will always try to be creative,"" he said. In December 2009, after a 14-year legal battle, Guatemalan Rody Alvarado was granted asylum on the grounds that she faced domestic abuse in her homeland. Her attorneys successfully argued that women who face domestic violence may be viewed as a particular social group, a requirement that must be met before asylum can be granted. Last year, a family from Germany who were Christian homeschoolers were granted asylum because of what they described as persecution from German authorities against that type of schooling. They argued that Germany didn't allow homeschooling for reasons of conscience. That said, Yale-Loehr added, the deaf immigrants face an uphill battle. ""They can apply for asylum, but I think they are going to have a hard time winning,"" he said. Discrimination is not the same thing as persecution, he said. The onus will be on the immigrants to show that they are being persecuted by the government or by people that the government cannot control. In the meantime, Bajramovic's reputation as a defender of the deaf immigrant community continues to grow. She has invested in sign language translators who can help with a diverse group of immigrants -- many who use unique signs from their individual countries. A few have even moved to California to be represented by her, she said.","60 deaf people, mostly from Mexico, are seeking asylum in the U.S.

"Los Cabos, Mexico (CNN) -- The United States on Tuesday supported European leaders' efforts to ease the debt crisis, including the formation of a ""banking union"" to safeguard their financial systems. ""If people have a sense of where they are going, that can provide confidence and break the fever,"" President Barack Obama said at the end of the two-day G-20 summit. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said European leaders, meeting again next week, want to design a long-term framework for stability and take swift steps to institute short-term reforms. ""What this means is a framework of reforms so they can stand behind their banks, provide capital to the banks that need it, make sure they're protecting the safety of their depositors,"" Geithner said. Leaders will work to ensure Italy and Spain can borrow at sustainable interest rates, said Geithner, indicating the United States was ""encouraged"" by developments and the meeting's focus on economic growth. G20 pledges to support world economy . The European Union earlier this month unveiled a plan to create a coordinated banking union rather than leaving troubled nations to deal with their own banking crisis. The proposal would include a single deposit guarantee organization covering all banks in the union, something similar to the FDIC, which covers U.S. bank deposits. The summit largely focused on boosting a sluggish global recovery threatened by a possible collapse of the euro currency union. European leaders are moving with a ""heightened sense of urgency"" to address the continent's financial problems, according to Obama. ""They understand the stakes and pledge to take the action needed to address this crisis."" The president acknowledged ""slower growth in Europe means slower growth in American jobs"" and the potential effects on the upcoming election. ""If we do the right thing, politics will follow,"" Obama said. Host President Felipe Calderon of Mexico, speaking at the end of the summit, said leaders agreed to extend a commitment to not introduce protectionist measures until 2014. He also told reporters that Spain had not formally asked for a bailout. In a declaration, G-20 leaders said they ""would act together to strengthen recovery and address financial market tensions."" ""Euro Area members of the G-20 will take all necessary policy measures to safeguard the integrity and stability of the area, improve the functioning of financial markets and break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks,"" they said. The International Monetary Fund said a number of member countries made emergency fund pledges, helping ""efforts to create a $456 billion global firewall that puts the IMF in a much better position to help its 188 member countries restore sounder economic and financial conditions worldwide. "" ""These resources are being made available for crisis prevention and resolution and to meet the potential financing needs of all IMF members,"" said Christine Legarde, managing director. The summit largely focused on one of the primary causes of the global economy's lethargic recovery -- the threat of a European currency collapse that would roil the already fragile economies of most of the 17 countries that use the euro. Obama played a role in ensuring other G-20 nations heard about European strategies, according to a senior administration official. ""The framework they (Europeans) are building, as they described it to us, amounts to a more forceful response than they've contemplated to date,"" the official said. A main topic of the summit was Sunday's elections in debt-ridden Greece, where the center-right New Democracy party received the most votes and was asked to try to form a coalition government. ""They all want to work in partnership with Greece to make sure that Greece is reforming within the EU,"" Geithner said of European leaders. The members of the G-20 are the United States, the European Union, Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Russia, China, Canada, Argentina, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Australia.

"(CNN) -- Sunday is National Grandparents Day. If you go to your local greeting card store, you can probably find plenty of cards to appreciate your grandmother, your grandfather, both your grandparents, your stepgrandparents, maybe even your two grandmothers who are a couple. What's missing? A card to thank the professional home care workers who help our grandparents survive and thrive in their old age. More than 90% of Americans agree that senior citizens should be able to age in their homes and communities. You don't want to visit your grandparents in a nursing home any more than they want to live there. But for the stay-at-home elderly to have so-called ""independent living"" they must be highly dependent on the home care aides who look after medication schedules, cook meals, assist with bathing and generally keep them happy and healthy. And yet these workers are anything but well cared for. The vast majority are dreadfully overworked and woefully underpaid. The average hourly wage of a home care worker in the United States is less than $10. In addition, most of these workers aren't professionalized health care aides with workplace benefits and protections, but are low-income African-American and immigrant women hired to fill in the gaps in our strained senior care system. That strain is only getting worse. Today in America, every eight seconds someone turns 65. This year alone, an estimated 4 million Americans will become senior citizens. The unprecedented wave of aging baby boomers is quickly multiplying the existing challenges of elder care. To meet the needs of tomorrow's seniors, we will need to add at least 1.6 million new trained and qualified care worker jobs by 2020. In a struggling economy with persistently high unemployment, the immediate need for 1.6 million new workers could be seen as an opportunity. But if all those jobs come with low wages and no benefits and rights, the graying of America will darken our economy even more. National Grandparents Day was started in 1978, not as an excuse to sell greeting cards but because community organizers wanted to encourage young people to value and care for senior citizens. In fact, the idea wasn't just to send loving thoughts on one day out of each year to your own grandparents but to ""adopt a grandparent"" year-round, very much in the spirit of caring for everyone in our communities, not just our own kin. National Grandparents Day is a reminder of the values of compassion, kindness and generosity that we sadly violate in the way we treat elder care and home care workers in America today. Last month, lawmakers in the California State Senate passed the Domestic Worker Bill of Rights, which would ensure that caregivers as well as housekeepers and nannies are paid overtime and have access to meal and rest breaks and other basic rights. Similar legislation was enacted in New York state in 2010. These laws only begin to reflect the new needs of our new moment: increasing the quality of care for this generation of senior citizens by increasing the quality of life for the hardworking home care aides on which they rely. When a stroke paralyzed the right side of my grandfather's body, my grandmother couldn't care for him all on her own. She hired Mrs. Sun, a home care worker, who helped my grandfather bathe, get dressed and meet his basic daily needs. Because of the important support and care Mrs. Sun provided, my grandparents were able to live together at home for four more years. While I want to describe Mrs. Sun as a saint for what she did for my grandfather, she is also a worker, a worker who deserves to be paid fairly. My grandparents literally helped give me life, the same as yours. The least we can do is make sure the people who care for them make a livelihood. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ai-jen Poo.","Ai-jen Poo: National Grandparents Day a good day to appreciate home care workers .

"(CNN) -- Teams from across the globe will soon learn whether their green designs will take top prize at Solar Decathlon Europe 2012 -- a competition that challenges collegiate designers to build houses powered exclusively by the sun. But beyond their use of photovoltaic panels, these sustainable homes of the future will also be judged on overall design, construction quality and the level of innovation. The 19 small houses that run solely on solar power were built over two weeks in September at Villa Solar in Madrid, Spain, and provide an architectural spectacle that the public can tour for free. Read more: Solar Decathlon Europe 2012 . Teams from Europe, China, Japan, Brazil and Egypt, designed these houses to produce minimal waste throughout the structures' life cycle. The lighting, heating and cooling must be fully functional in each house, as do any household appliances inside them, like televisions and ovens. Plumbing is the only component not set up in these showcase homes. During their final days on display, the houses accumulate points through a series of 10 mini-contests, each measuring specific parameters like architecture, engineering, energy efficiency and market viability. The team with the most points after the final judging wins. With two more contests to go, a French team's house, ""Canopea,"" is leading the pack, followed by a Spanish team's ""Patio 2.12"" and an Italian team's house, called ""Med in Italy."" Ecolar, a team from Germany, is in fourth place right now but its team member, Jakob Winter, says just completing the house the way they had conceptualized it is gratifying enough. ""The most rewarding thing is the feedback of the visitors,"" he said. ""So many people have come to me after the tour to say what a wonderful building it is, and the atmosphere inside the house. We're just very happy because we feel the same inside our house."" Feedback is important for a team like Ecolar, which is one of the teams that already has concrete plans to take its prototype to the market. ""We already have several inquiries from all around the world of people who would very much like to purchase an Ecolar home,"" Winter said. Ecolar won the award for having the best engineering. It is a prefabricated modular home, meaning that they have designed several structures that can all be pieced together in a broader system. The team enhanced the house's ""passive"" temperature regulation to save energy, which meant using hemp in its walls, ceiling and floor for better insulation, and installing clay plates on the ceiling to absorb heat. Like several of the other houses, Ecolar uses vertical, semi-transparent solar panels on the house's faÃ§ade, which lets in natural light while helping to supply energy. Sustainable materials were taken into consideration for most entrants. A team from RWTH Aachen University in Germany, which designed the Counter Entropy House, found several innovative ways to incorporate items normally thought of as unusable: melted CDs were used to build plastic panels for the house's facade, and salvaged beams and wood from the university's stadium also served as building material. The house was also designed so that all of its parts can be easily separated for recycling. Amid the boxy structures, one house, designed by the team from the Technical University of Denmark, took an unusual yet striking shape. The house is called Fold, which looks lopsided with slanted walls and a slanted roof. The angles are meant to be adjustable, depending on where the house is built, to maximize the solar panels' exposure to the sun. Like many other of the entrants, Fold produces more energy than it consumes, which means the excess power can be sent through the grid for other uses. At Villa Solar, the prototype houses' overall surplus energy powers event spaces. The competition was spun off from the original Solar Decathlon held biannually by the U.S. Department of Energy in Washington, D.C., and is the result of an agreement between the U.S. and Spain, which is hosting the European edition for the second time.","Solar Decathlon Europe brings together university teams from around the world .

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Throughout the 1990s, São Paulo's House of Detention contained about 8,000 of Latin America's most violent criminals. Better known as Carandiru, it was once the largest prison on the continent. On October 2, 1992, a massive fight broke out in the Brazilian complex among the prisoners. It ultimately resulted in 111 inmate deaths. That day, there were 84 state military police officers present, and 102 bullets were fired. The nine guys who weren't shot in their vital organs got knifed, but the cops (none of whom were killed, by the way) swore that the prisoners were already carved up by the time guards arrived. In the archival images we collected, we see one inmate partially decapitated and another with a hole in his chest the size of a tennis ball. That doesn't exactly scream self-defense. (The footage is graphic, so be warned.) See the rest of Carandiru's Bloody Memories at VBS.TV . Ronaldo Mazotto de Lima worked at the prison for over a decade. He was also one of the first people to witness the aftermath of the carnage that's now referred to as the Carandiru Massacre. After the jail's destruction, Mazotto de Lima transferred to a minimum-security prison in Serra Azul. He brought more than his experience to the new job. He also took along some of the only surviving evidence of the massacre: More than 2,000 photos, 300 personal effects and 10 hours of grisly video footage. It was all taken shortly after the violence subsided, and he wants to be sure that history doesn't forget what he witnessed. So we asked him to help us understand.

"(CNN) -- A suspect fired his gun inside the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque Tuesday, but no one was injured, the university and police said. Police identified the apparent gunman as Cesar Dominguez-Garcia, 21. Witnesses told officers that a female patient was with her child when the woman's boyfriend entered the room, police said. The couple began to argue. During the altercation, the suspect pulled out a small handgun and purposefully fired it, according to a statement from the Albuquerque Police Department. He then fled. Video shows the man leaving the hospital about an hour later, said police, adding that the search for the suspect continues. ""They confirm one person was in the hospital and shot his gun inside the hallway, but no one was injured,"" said Cindy Foster, a spokeswoman for the UNM Health Sciences Center. The university lifted a lockdown order it had previously issued for all personnel in the central and northern portions of the campus.","NEW: Police identify the suspect as Cesar Dominguez-Garcia, 21 .

"(CNN) -- It was a busy week for Facebook, which hit a major milestone, made fashion news and made some users uneasy about privacy again. In case you missed it, here are the highlights: . 1. Reached 1 billion users . In short: As of October 4, one of every seven people on the planet are actively using Facebook each month.""Helping a billion people connect is amazing, humbling and by far the thing I am most proud of in my life,"" Zuckerberg told CNN Money. The reaction: On the CNN Facebook page we asked if readers knew anyone who didn't use the service. Responses came in from around the world, including China, where a Facebook user said the service is ""not allowed."" Shauna Racette-Graham wrote, ""Yup I know ppl who don't use FB, I think they are just weird."" Jo Ann wrote, ""Yep, my mother. Yet she has no problem texting me obsessively!"" Chris Horne may not know them personally, but he wrote, ""Tons of old people don't use Facebook."" The most detailed answer probably came from Esperanca Pizzolante, ""My mom, some colleagues, an ex-boyfriend, a politics teacher two or three financial executives..."" 2. Released an ad that confused people . In short: As a way to celebrate their role as the connective tissue of society, Facebook released their first advertisement, ""The Things That Connect Us."" The ad compares the site to things ranging from bridges to chairs.The reaction: A parody Twitter account @Facebookschair and general head-scratching. ""Does anyone understand that Facebook ad yet?"" posted @Facebookschair ""I don't and I was its star!"" ""Chairs are for people. And this is why chairs are like Facebook"" the ad states, showing rows of empty chairs. ""Honored to have been featured in Facebook's first commercial,"" posted @InvisibleObama, a parody account that cropped up after Clint Eastwood's mock debate with an empty chair at the Republican convention. 3. Had CEO Zuckerberg admit he wears the same thing every day (as if we couldn't see) In short: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview on ""NBC's Today"" that he lives a ""simple"" life and proudly wears the same thing every day. (A grey T-shirt)The reaction: Making too many decisions about mundane details is a waste of your mental energy, says the Harvard Business Review. In the October issue of Vanity Fair President Obama said this:""You'll see I wear only gray or blue suits,"" he said. ""I'm trying to pare down decisions. I don't want to make decisions about what I'm eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make."" He mentioned research that shows the simple act of making decisions degrades one's ability to make further decisions. It's why shopping is so exhausting. ""You need to focus your decision-making energy. You need to routinize yourself. You can't be going through the day distracted by trivia."" Other successful people known to wear the same thing every day? Steve Jobs and Albert Einstein. CNN Commenter MarkM87 said, ""How you dress reflects you personality. When you look good, you feel good. Zuckerberg is obviously an incredibly boring person with no personality."" Bruno Domingues disagrees. ""Funny, I do the same thing. Because I don't like to have to think about what I am going to wear so when I find something I like, I buy more than one piece. Just very practical people I guess."" 4. Redefined private . In short: The Next Web reported Thursday that Facebook ""confirmed scanning users' private messages for shared links to Web pages with Like buttons, so it can increase the number of corresponding Likes for those pages.""Facebook's response: ""We did recently find a bug with our social plugins where at times the count for the Share or Like goes up by two, and we are working on a fix to solve the issue now.

This bug does not impact the user experience with messages or what appears on their timelines."" An update and further explanation are at The Next Web. The reaction: Spke posted, ""Who cares, exactly what gmail does to serve ads"" ""This has to make you wonder what other stats FB is inflating,"" @rk tweeted. 5. Offered to promote personal posts -- for a $7 fee . In short: Users in the U.S. can promote their personal posts for a $7 per-post fee. ""When you promote a post it is placed higher in the news feed so your friends and subscribers are more likely to notice it,"" Facebook wrote in a blog post.The reaction: ""$7 to promote you posts? There's a Zucker born every minute,"" wrote sapient69. Many suggested cutting down on the number of ""fake friends."" Lisztman wrote, ""I don't see a problem with someone paying to advertise.

"Rome (CNN) -- Italy faces a period of uncertainty and political horse trading Tuesday after parliamentary elections left no party in a clear position to form a government. The center-left coalition headed by Pier Luigi Bersani won by a narrow margin in Italy's lower house of parliament, according to final figures released by the Interior Ministry. But Bersani's coalition, with 29.54% of the vote, finished less than half a percentage point ahead of the anti-austerity center-right coalition headed by controversial three-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which garnered 29.18%. It was a similar story in Italy's upper house, where the lack of a clear majority means that no one has a firm enough mandate to govern the country. Final results showed the center-left winning the Senate with 31.63% of the vote, compared with the center-right's 30.72% -- an outcome that points to stalemate because of the way Senate seats are distributed. ""This is a case of gridlock,"" said James Walston of the American University of Rome. ""Nothing could be worse for Europe."" International concern is high that Italy -- the third-largest economy in the eurozone and the eighth-biggest in the world -- could face fresh elections if no coalition government can be formed. In any case, a weak government would probably struggle to push through the tough reforms many observers feel are needed to get the economy back on track. Symbolizing Italians' own unhappiness with austerity and their political leaders, a quarter of the vote in the lower house went to the anti-establishment Five Star protest movement led by comedian Beppe Grillo, who has said he won't join forces with any established political parties. A bloc led by Mario Monti, the former head of a technocrat government that steered Italy through the worst of the eurozone crisis last year, trailed badly in fourth place. Markets reacted negatively to the uncertainty Tuesday, with fears about the eurozone crisis coming once more to the fore after months during which confidence had grown. Even if Bersani can form a workable coalition, governing will be very difficult, and investors are concerned that a stalemate in the Senate could undermine the progress Italy has made in overhauling its troubled economy. European markets, including Milan, were sharply lower in morning trading, while Asian markets also retreated. U.S. stocks fell Monday amid the concerns about Italy, with the Dow and S&P 500 suffering their biggest one-day declines of the year. U.S. stock futures were indicating a rebound for stocks at the open on Tuesday. Can the anti-Berlusconi pull Italy out of the mire? Voter turnout was lower than anticipated Sunday, the first day of balloting, down from 62.55% in 2008 to 55.17% this year, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. Weather, in part, appeared to cause the lower voter turnout, the news agency said. It was snowing in portions of northern Italy and raining in the southern part of the country. Alliance-building . Italy's political system encourages the forming of alliances. But if neither Bersani nor Berlusconi can build a strong enough coalition to govern, Italy could face another round of elections. Beppe Grillo: Clown prince of Italian politics . The center-left alliance dominated by Bersani's Democratic Party also includes the more left-wing Left Ecology Freedom party. It was widely assumed ahead of the vote that the center-left would join forces with Monti's bloc, but its disappointing showing means that even together, they cannot command a majority in the upper house. Bersani held a clear lead in polling in the weeks ahead of the vote but saw it slip away in the final days of the campaign. Walston, the analyst, said ahead of the vote that the left had suffered from a lack of leadership, which prevented it from putting forward a clear picture. Bersani, 61, comes across as ""bluff and homespun, and that's part of his appeal -- or not, depending on your point of view,"" said Walston. The center-right alliance led by Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, or PdL, in coalition with the right-wing, anti-immigration Northern League, made up significant ground in the final days of campaigning. Berlusconi gave conflicting signals as to whether he was running for the premiership, indicating that he would seek the job if his coalition won, but contradicting that on other occasions. In a phone interview Tuesday with Italian journalist and TV host Maurizio Belpietro, he said everyone had tried their best to help their country. ""The difference this time is that we weren't able to see through to the end and win,"" Berlusconi said. He acknowledged that the confused result has done nothing to help market confidence. But, he added, ""I don't think Monti will be able to form any type of coalition with his policy of austerity and his dangerous economic policies that have hurt Italy."" Unless either Bersani or -- even less likely -- Berlusconi can persuade Grillo to enter an alliance, their options are limited. Grillo, the 64-year-old known as the ""clown prince"" of Italian politics, has been outspoken in his criticism of Berlusconi and other politicians in the three years since he founded his party, known as M5S. CNN iReporter Elisa Bozzi, an Italian art curator, said she was very disappointed by the outcome of the election. ""Yesterday when I saw the result I was completely without words,"" she said. ""I think we in Italy will go again to vote because it's impossible to govern a state in this situation, (where) we don't have a majority."" She believes many voters hold Monti responsible for Italy's current debt crisis without remembering the dire economic situation he inherited when Berlusconi resigned in 2011. At the same time, Bersani failed to gain people's confidence, she said. ""Beppe Grillo has many votes because people are angry and frustrated,"" Bozzi said. ""People in Italy are completely disappointed by the situation we see day-by-day, by corruption, scandals."" Such is voters' disillusion that Bozzi believes Grillo could garner enough votes in fresh elections to win outright. Berlusconi's troubles . Berlusconi, the septuagenarian playboy billionaire nicknamed ""Il Cavaliere,"" campaigned as a Milan court weighed his appeal against a tax fraud conviction, for which he was sentenced to four years in jail last year. The verdict has still to be delivered; however, under the Italian legal system, he is entitled to a further appeal in a higher court. Because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire this year, meaning there is a good chance that none of the defendants will serve any prison time. Italian parliamentarians are elected for five-year terms, with the current one due to end in April. But in December, the PdL withdrew its support of the reformist government led by Monti, saying it was pursuing policies that ""were too German-centric."" Monti subsequently resigned, and the parliament was dissolved. Italy's economy has stagnated for years, and suffered the biggest contraction of any G7 nation in 2012 -- it shrank by 2.2%. Last week, the European Commission said it would contract by a further 1.0% this year, double the rate it had previously forecast. Meanwhile, unemployment will rise to 11.6% in 2013, according to the European Commission, and then 12% next year. CNN's Barbie Latza Nadeau, Hada Messia and Becky Anderson reported from Rome. Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. Mark Thompson also contributed to this report from London.","NEW: ""We weren't able to see through to the end and win,"" Berlusconi says of election .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Glenn Close said she is ""distraught"" that her image was used in one of a series of profanity- and slur-laden videos aboard the Navy's USS Enterprise. ""The cynical, unauthorized use of my image in this video is deeply offensive and insulting, and was the result of a seemingly innocent request made during a visit to an aircraft carrier over four years ago,"" Close said, according to a statement from publicist Catherine Olim on Tuesday. In the videos, Navy Capt. Owen Honors is shown cursing along with other members of his staff in an attempt to demonstrate humor. There are also anti-gay slurs, simulated sex acts, and what appear to be two female sailors in a shower together. Excerpts from the videos and descriptions of their content were first published Saturday by The Virginian-Pilot newspaper in Norfolk, Virginia. Sailors told The Virginian-Pilot that Close was persuaded to make a short appearance on camera during her visit. Honors will be permanently relieved of his command of the ship, a top Navy commander said Tuesday. Honors was the executive officer -- or second in command -- of the USS Enterprise when the videos were made and had since taken command of the ship. An image from the video shows Close sitting in a chair, dressed in black and wearing what appears to be a ""USS Enterprise"" hat. The context of her appearance was not immediately clear.","Close says she visited the USS Enterprise more than four years ago .

"(CNN) -- You may not know his name, but anyone who watches movies and television knows the squat, tough-faced character actor Charles Durning, who died on Christmas Eve, according to his family. The 89-year-old decorated World War II veteran had an award-winning career that spanned 20th Century entertainment, from the burlesque stage and theater to television and film, playing roles as diverse as society itself. Durning was the gruff father smitten by Dustin Hoffman's female impersonation of ""Tootsie,"" the Southern politician dancing on stage with George Clooney's Soggy Bottom Boys in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and the corrupt cop caught up in the ""big con"" by Paul Newman and Robert Redford in ""The Sting."" He won Tony and Golden Globe awards and was nominated for Academy Awards two times as a supporting actor. He also received nine Emmy nominations and was honored in 2007 with a lifetime achievement award from the Screen Actors Guild. Born in Highland Falls, New York, on February 28, 1923, Durning became an actor relatively late. According to his TV Guide biography, Durning left home at age 16 and later enlisted in the Army. Durning landed at Normandy on D-Day and fought in the Battle of the Bulge, receiving the Silver Star and three Purple Hearts. He worked odd jobs that ranged from professional boxing to teaching ballroom dancing to ushering in a burlesque house, where he got his start on stage by once filling in for a comic who failed to show up, the actor often recalled. He also attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he trained with Jason Robards, Colleen Dewhurst and others. Some of Durning's other best-known roles included his Tony-winning performance as Big Daddy in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", the governor in ""Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"", a beleaguered police officer in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and as Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant in ""The Muppet Movie."" Durning's family, in a statement issued Tuesday, said, ""Not only was Charlie a World War II hero but he was also a hero to his family. Charlie loved Christmas and if he could have chosen a time to pass, he would have chosen this day.""

"(EW.com) -- Did Billy Crystal rescue the Oscars? Even with few box-office heavyweights in contention for top categories, Sunday night's 84th Annual Academy Awards telecast rose slightly in the ratings from last year. ABC's awards coverage delivered 39.3 million viewers, up 4 percent from 2011, according to the network. In the adult demo, the show received an 11.7 rating, off a tenth from 2011. The program out-delivered three of the past four Oscars telecasts and ranked as ABC's most-watched program in two years. And yet, the Oscars were outshone in one respect: CBS' Grammys coverage earlier this month pulled a slightly bigger audience than the usually dominant Academy Awards, and totally stomped the Oscars in the adult demo. The music awards show had 39.9 million viewers, just barely edging out Sunday's telecast. If last night's viewership tally is sustained in Nielsen's national ratings release tomorrow, it will mark the first year the Grammys drew a larger crowd than the Oscars since Nielsen started its current ratings system in 1992. Among adults 18-49, there was no contest: Grammys had a 14.1 rating to Oscars 11.7. Here's how the Oscars have fared in recent years: . -- 2011: 37.9 million viewers / 11.8 adult demo rating (""King's Speech"") -- 2010: 41.7 million viewers / 13.3 adult demo rating (""Hurt Locker"") -- 2009: 36.3 million viewers / 12.1 adult demo rating (""Slumdog Millionaire"") -- 2008: 32 million viewers / 10.7 adult demo rating (""No Country for Old Men"") -- Lowest . -- 2007: 40.2 million viewers / 14.1 adult demo rating (""The Departed"") ... -- 1998: 55.2 million viewers (""Titanic"") -- Highest . Also Sunday night: CBS' ""Amazing Race"" (7.6 million, 2.1) was down 25 percent this week (understandably). NBC's ""Celebrity Apprentice"" (5 million, 1.8) was hammered down 31 percent (also understandably -- if you like celebrities, are you going to watch Donald Trump's Island of Broken Toys or the Oscars?).

"(CNN) -- An Arizona sheriff's deputy who said he was shot by a suspected drug trafficker in the desert has been fired following an investigation into comments he made to a Phoenix newspaper and investigators, the department said Wednesday. Louie Puroll, who was previously suspended, will appeal his termination, the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Ten allegations were sustained during an internal probe, including incompetence, improper conduct, and violations of truthfulness and the code of ethics, according to the statement. Sheriff Paul Babeu cited comments Puroll made to reporter Paul Rubin of the Phoenix New Times, which challenged Puroll's version of the April 30 shooting incident. ""I stood by my deputy after he was shot by drug smugglers in April because his statements to both criminal and internal investigators were consistent, supported by physical evidence, radio transmissions, GPS coordinates, other victims/witnesses and later through gunshot residue testing conducted on the shirt he was wearing,"" Babeu said in the statement. ""The manner in which Deputy Puroll conducted himself following the shooting investigation when interviewed by Reporter Paul Rubin brought great discredit to himself and the men and women representing our sworn law enforcement profession."" The department released no other details of the investigation. Puroll told the newspaper that representatives of ""the Mexican cartel"" have approached him four or five times over the years wanting to do business and asking him to look the other way. Puroll told the newspaper he didn't arrest any of these men, call for backup, or write reports about the encounters, the New Times reported. Puroll was also investigated for allegedly telling the reporter ""you're lucky to be alive right now"" and that he knew a rancher who offered to murder the reporter after his initial article challenged Puroll's account of his wounding, sheriff's office spokesman Tim Gaffney said in early December. In October, authorities said Puroll was telling the truth about how he was wounded. They presented evidence from a follow-up investigation provoked by a media report that challenged the deputy's version of events. ""Many have suggested a conspiracy, (that) somehow our deputy shot himself,"" Babeu said at a press conference October 7. ""People weighed in that weren't from Arizona ... and it put that question of doubt in the public's mind that there's something here to look at."" In September, The Phoenix New Times cited forensic experts who challenged the account from Puroll, who said he was shot in the central Arizona desert from a distance by an illegal immigrant with an AK-47. Two experts were quoted by the New Times as saying the evidence suggested Puroll had been shot at very close range. The Pinal County Sheriff's Office said in October that new testing on the bullet-torn shirt Puroll was wearing on the day of the shooting had ruled out a close-range shot. ""The physical evidence, radio traffic, phone calls and now this gunshot residue testing completed by the Arizona Department of Public Safety all confirm (Puroll's) account of the events,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. The New Times allegations provoked the sheriff's office to reopen its investigation into the case ""to maintain transparency,"" according to the sheriff's office, and ""to prove without question that the weapon fired at Deputy Puroll was not a 'contact wound.' "" The office said last year that Puroll's shirt from the day of the incident was tested by the Arizona Department of Public Safety for ""the presence of munitions residue, indicative of a close contact discharge."" ""This testing further confirms that the gunshot wound was not a close contact shot as had been reported by the two doctors through a local media entity,"" the statement said, referring to The Phoenix New Times. Asked at an October press conference if he was anxious about how the tests would come back, Puroll said no. ""I did not need any test -- I was there,"" he said. ""I did not shoot myself."" On April 30, Puroll contacted authorities after being wounded in the desert, Lt. Tammy Villar, a sheriff's spokeswoman, said at the time. The deputy radioed that he had encountered five men, some wielding long guns and handguns, and said they were carrying a large amount of marijuana. At one point the deputy lost radio contact with authorities, leading to a search by foot and by air for him and the shooter, according to CNN affiliate KNXV. Video from the scene showed that the deputy was located while sitting in desert brush, surrounded by cactus. He was able to walk to a helicopter, which airlifted him to a hospital. The deputy was shot in the left abdomen and suffered a superficial wound, law enforcement sources said at the time. The shooting came amid a national debate over Arizona's tough new immigration law.","Sheriff's office terminates deputy over comments to newspaper .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Though she is free to leave court-ordered rehab for substance abuse this week, actress Lindsay Lohan's legal issues could get more complicated after police in California said she violated her probation. The Riverside County Sheriff's Department said Lohan violated probation when she allegedly tussled with a then-staff member at the Betty Ford Center here as she was undergoing three months of court-ordered substance abuse rehab. Authorities plan to send the result of their investigation to the district attorney's office to decide if the actress should face battery charges -- even though the former staff member has said she will no longer cooperate with the investigation and does not want charges filed, the department said Monday. ""It is expected that this investigation will be sent to the district attorney's office later this week,"" the sheriff's office added. The Betty Ford Center fired the staffer, Dawn Holland, after information about the December 12 incident was leaked to the media. ""When patients come to the center for treatment, they come to a safe place where their identity is protected, where anonymity is safeguarded,"" the center said in a statement, without confirming Holland was the employee in question. Holland has told investigators she will ""no longer be cooperating with the investigation and does not wish to have charges filed,"" the sheriff's office said. Last month, Lohan's lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley confirmed that an ""incident"" had taken place, but declined to comment on what happened. Meanwhile, Holland's lawyer said last month that the former staffer was ""targeted, unmercifully interrogated, intimidated and threatened with her livelihood"" by the treatment center. Lohan checked into the Betty Ford Center on September 27 after it became clear a judge intended to send her to jail because of a failed drug test. The judge eventually ordered Lohan to stay in the drug rehabilitation program until Monday instead of going to jail. Lohan's probation is scheduled to end in August of 2011. Prosecutor Danette Meyers said she expects to see Lohan back in municipal court on February 1 for a review of whether she has fulfilled the terms of her probation. Lohan's legal troubles began when she was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence; in the second incident, she was charged with cocaine possession. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elden Fox has said if Lohan violates the rules of her rehab program or fails a drug test before her court date on February 25, she will be sent to jail for 180 days. CNN's Alan Duke and In Session's Grace Wong contributed to this report.","Investigators have been looking into claim that Lohan tussled with an employee .

"(CNN) -- The BBC will pay British politician Lord Alistair McAlpine £185,000, or about $293,480, to settle his libel claim arising from a news program about child abuse allegations at children's homes, the BBC said Thursday. ""The settlement is comprehensive and reflects the gravity of the allegations that were wrongly made,"" the BBC said. A BBC ""Newsnight"" program on November 2 focused on allegations of child abuse from the 1970s and 1980s at children's homes in Wales. It said two victims had alleged that a Conservative, Thatcher-era politician, whom it did not identify by name, had been among their abusers. After Internet speculation identified McAlpine, a senior political figure of the 1980s, as the alleged abuser, the victim admitted he had identified the wrong man. Alastair Campbell: Despite its failings and our past clashes, I back BBC . The BBC aired an apology the day after the program was broadcast, but it did little to contain the fallout from the false accusation. On Monday, the BBC announced that an internal investigation concluded the program's production was marked by a series of ""unacceptable"" failures. The investigation into the program was carried out by BBC Scotland Director Ken MacQuarrie, who noted that the complex story had moved from commission to transmission in six days, an unusually short period for the BBC. During the controversy about the story, McAlpine, former treasurer and deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, denied any involvement and indicated he would take legal action, MacQuarrie's report said. The story was the second major crisis to hit the BBC within months. In late September, the BBC became embroiled in a scandal over its handling of sexual abuse allegations against its late TV presenter Jimmy Savile. Latest arrest in Savile sex abuse investigation . The scandal exploded amid revelations that ""Newsnight"" pulled a report into allegations against Savile ahead of a planned tribute to the late TV presenter by the news organization scheduled to air later this year. Former BBC Director General George Entwistle and others were called in front of lawmakers to answer for the scandal surrounding Savile, who authorities say was suspected of having sexually abused young women and girls, sometimes on BBC premises. The BBC had established a separate chain of command for all stories related to Savile, but it was not clear whether the Wales story was regarded as Savile-related, MacQuarrie's report said. ""As a consequence there was ambiguity around who was taking the ultimate editorial responsibility for the 'Newsnight' report, particularly in the days leading up to the day of transmission,"" it said. In addition, some ""basic journalistic checks were not completed"" during the editorial process, it continued. ""Specifically, identification was not confirmed by photograph with the first victim. The second victim could not be traced in order to provide up to date corroboration. ... No right of reply was offered to the unnamed individual at the center of the allegation."" The ""key parties"" did not agree on who was responsible for the final editorial approval for the story, he added. Before MacQuarrie's review was completed, BBC News Director Helen Boaden and her deputy, Steve Mitchell, were asked to ""surrender all their responsibilities"" pending the outcome of the review, the BBC said.

The raid took place around 5 a.m. in the Cocody neighborhood at the party headquarters of a key member of the pro-Ouattara political coalition that backed him for the runoff, the government said on national television. ""Sixty-three persons have been detained, eight injured, including seven police officers,"" said an Interior Ministry spokesman. ""The supporter died of his wounds... he was armed with a knife and had tried to attack police officers and gendarmes,"" added the spokesman, who identified the victim as a northern tribesman. Police seized machetes, knives, daggers and traditional protection amulets associated with armed rebels, the spokesman said. The raid took place after police received complaints about attacks against local residents carried out by the occupants of the building, said the spokesman. Residents interviewed on the scene after the raid reported that supporters of Ouattara had been camping in the bulding since the November 28 election runoff, which international observers say was won by Ouattara. The residents said the group had been involved in violence in the neighborhood, including robbing a bakery and clashing with pro-Gbabgo students from a nearby campus. Two U.N. vehicles appeared on the scene following the raid, but were ordered to leave by police forces loyal to Gbagbo. In the afternoon, the building was guarded by police officers who said no more supporters remained inside. The incident came on the same day that talks between Ivory Coast's political rivals and African mediators failed to break the political impasse that has left Gbagbo clinging to power, despite international pressure for him to step down. President-elect Ouattara has said he will not meet with Gbagbo until Gbagbo acknowledges electoral defeat. ""Ouattara has always been clear on this issue since the beginning,"" said Patrick Achi, Ouattara's spokesman. However, Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the envoy for the African Union, urged patience in resolving the crisis through negotiations. ""Military action will cost lives and we want to avoid that,"" Odinga told CNN. The Kenyan leader, who visited Abidjan on Monday along with a delegation representing West African states, said Gbagbo agreed to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis without conditions. But Ouattara will not negotiate until he is recognized as the legitimate president and Gbagbo lifts a siege on the waterfront Golf Hotel, where Ouattara has been holed up since the runoff, Odinga said. Gbagbo, who has given no sign that he is retreating from his claim to the presidency, told the African leaders he would pull back his military by noon Tuesday, but Ivorian forces remained at the hotel in the evening. ""The (African Union's) position is that Ouattara is the president,"" Odinga said. ""The option that Laurent Gbagbo has is to negotiate a decent exit with guarantees."" African leaders have urged Ouattara to ensure that Gbagbo and his supporters will not be persecuted if he steps down. ECOWAS has threatened to use ""legitimate force"" to remove Gbagbo and called a two-day meeting of its defense chiefs January 17 to plan steps if he has failed to step down by then. Gbagbo has said he wants an an international committee to recount the vote. Odinga said Tuesday that a recount was no longer possible because the election documents have been in the custody of Gbagbo's supporters who could have tampered with them. CNN's Zain Verjee and Salma Abdelaziz and Journalist Eric Agnero contributed to this report.","NEW: 63 people have been detained, 8 injured, 7 of them police, the Interior Ministry says .

"Washington (CNN) -- In his retirement announcement, Republican Sen. Saxby Cambliss cited ""the dearth of meaningful action from Congress"" as one reason for not seeking re-election next year. ""The debt-ceiling debacle of 2011 and the recent fiscal-cliff vote showed Congress at its worst and, sadly, I don't see the legislative gridlock and partisan posturing improving anytime soon,"" the Capitol Hill veteran said in a statement. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin can appreciate Chambliss' sentiments. When was asked earlier this month about the functionality of Congress, he chalked up the body's poor legislative record to a few problems. The most important one, he said, was the fact that members don't know one another outside of work. ""In two years [since he came to Washington], we have not had, in the Senate, a bipartisan caucus, where Democrats and Republicans talked about the problems of the day to try and find commonality,"" he lamented. Manchin is not alone. ""It is very sad. And I know many times I would look up on TV and I would see somebody and then the name would come up and it would say 'member of Congress' and I'd go 'I don't even know who that is,'"" said former Republican Rep. Connie Mack, who lost his re-election bid in November. It is a common refrain on the Hill -- the idea that if Congress were more social, more buddy-buddy outside the Capitol complex, that it would be more functional in doing the people's work. The good old days . The truth is not that simple, according to former leaders of the Senate and House. The nostalgia for the ""good ol' days,"" when members would play tennis atop the Hart Office Building and drink whiskey after hours, may be tempting to admire, but it is far from the cure-all for Washington's seemingly unbreakable gridlock, they say. ""Nostalgia is always great,"" Dan Glickman, a former Democratic representative from Kansas and senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said with a laugh. ""Sometimes I remember my life as congressman in the '80s positively and my wife says I am dreaming. 'You hated it,' she will say,"" he said. Glickman was in Congress from 1977 to 1995 then was President Bill Clinton's agriculture secretary until 2001. He said he watched Congress change in the late 1990s and 2000s and wondered about the tipping point. His synopsis: Congress is like other organizations, except it has 535 independent contractors rather than a business-like structure built around a chain of command. ""Congress is no different than any other organization, if people don't get along, then you get dysfunction,"" Glickman said. ""Basic principles of just human interaction are if you don't like each other and you distrust each other, that is a recipe for an unproductive life."" If numbers are any judge, the 112th Congress was markedly unproductive. The 220 laws enacted were the least in four decades. One fifth dealt with naming or renaming post offices and federal buildings. By comparison, the 100th Congress enacted 713 laws. DC an electoral death trap . Being more sociable ""is not the cure-all,"" Glickman said. Other former members of Congress and high-level aides say the good old days may have been nicer, sociability won't lead to bipartisanship. ""I think it is broader and bigger than that,"" said former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. ""I don't want too much revisionist history. Everybody said that was the golden era [in the early 90s]. It was not always easy, though. We had some pretty tough disagreements."" Lott points to the welfare debate between Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich and impeachment proceedings against the president in the late 90s as examples. For men like Glickman and Lott, the problems of Congress are deeper than whether they dine, drink and hang out with each other. The fact that California is only a five-hour flight from Washington means that members can easily get into town on a Monday and head out by Thursday night, leaving no time to socialize. ""When I first came to Washington, members had six roundtrip air tickets paid for,"" Lott said. ""Now it is unlimited, you can use whatever part of your budget on airfare."" ""Congress is becoming a commuter Congress,"" said former Democratic Sen. Bryon Dorgan from North Dakota. Living in Washington also has become an electoral death trap. ""If members are going to be social with each other, it is going to have to be in Washington,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of The Rothenberg Political Report. ""Members are spending the least amount of time in Washington as possible because they don't want the baggage of being seen as 'too Washington.'"" Funds are raised from the extremes, not in the middle, said Patrick Kennedy, a former House member from Rhode Island who did not seek re-election in 2010. Until there are well-funded outside groups funding centrist candidates, he said, the polarization of the House and Senate will get worse. ""You [a member of Congress] follow the money and you follow the activists and of course those folks, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, keep you out of the middle because the middle is the valley of death politically,"" Kennedy said. Cards anyone? Lott believes President Barack Obama is a big part of the problem. ""He doesn't really invite Democrats over there very often, let alone Republicans,"" he said. The truism that Obama isn't social enough with Congress was a common refrain during his first four years in office and that won't change, if history is any judge. When asked about it, the president generally laughs it off, references his kids and moves on. He did exactly that on January 15 when a reporter asked him whether he and the White House staff ""are too insular."" ""Obviously, I can always do a better job,"" Obama said. ""And the nice thing is that now that my girls are getting older, they don't want to spend that much time with me anyway, so I'll be probably calling around, looking for somebody to play cards with me or something, because I'm getting kind of lonely in this big house."" Some Democrats, like Jim Manley, a former spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, say the idea that more would get done if Obama were more of a schmoozer is wrong. ""Anyone who thinks that by virtue of the president inviting Senator [Mitch] McConnell down to the White House to watch a movie is going to help improve things needs to get their head examined,"" Manley said. ""That is not the way it works."" But if you ask Capitol Hill watchers like Gonzales, the distance between Obama and Congress is an issue. Democrats want a fuller embrace from their leader in the White House, while Republicans feel they aren't getting the level of respect they deserve. For that to happen, says Gonzales, there has to be something in it for both sides. ""What is the incentive for them [the president and Republicans] to foster these relationships,"" Gonzales said. ""Their time is valuable, just to be friends for the sake of being friends, I don't know that they have time. It is good in theory, but until they see the fruits of that time investment."" For Lott, the fruits of investing in collegiality are obvious -- lifelong friendships. Lott said he still considers Democrat and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle a good friend, and that he has spent weekends away with former Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, both Republicans, and their wives. Lott's most enduring relationship from Congress seems to be with Phil Gramm, a Democrat who switched parties in the House and then became a Republican senator from Florida. Lott and his wife, Patricia, are close with Gramm and his wife, Wendy Lee. Last year they traveled to South Africa and Botswana on a personal trip together and the foursome plans to go to Turkey in June. ""Friends are for life,"" Lott said about Gramm. ""Especially if they are real friends.""","A common refrain is the notion that a more sociable Congress would be more effective .
The 112th Congress enacted the fewest laws in four decades .
Congress used to be more sociable, but there were issues then, too .
Some observers believe Obama's lack of social engagement is a problem ."
"Rome (CNN) -- Allegations that Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had sex with a teenage prostitute are ""mud"" thrown on him by political opponents who want to get rid of him, the scandal-prone politician said. ""But this time they've surpassed any limit,"" Berlusconi said in a statement. ""The mud will fall on those who use justice as a political weapon."" The ""judicial machination ... will not succeed in stopping us or in taking us away from our commitment to change the country. This time also they will not succeed,"" he said in the statement posted on his party's website Saturday. Berlusconi is under investigation for allegedly having sex with the teenager, say prosecutors in Milan, who are linking the case to prostitution activity. The teen, identified as nightclub dancer Karima El Mahrough and nicknamed Ruby, was 17 at the time of the alleged activity, from February till May. She denied ever having sex with him in an interview recorded Saturday and broadcast Sunday. She said Berlusconi was ""a person who is accused of something he has never done. ""If you want to write, then write things that are true and not these lies and bar-room gossip,"" she told journalists and prosecutors. ""If you don't like Berlusconi, then attack him with something else. Not with this taking advantage of a girl."" But she said she had received 7,000 euros (about $9,300) from him the first time they met, on Valentine's Day 2010, because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help. She said she was a guest at several dinners he gave, but that she did not know him well. She told the prime minister, among others, that she was 24 ""because I didn't want people to know that I was a minor,"" she said in the interview broadcast on Italy's Sky TG24. The Milan prosecutor said Berlusconi is being probed for complicity in prostitution with a minor and abuse of power. Italian media reports say Berlusconi has been summoned for questioning from January 21 to 23, but it is unclear if he will answer the prosecutor's summons. The premier's attorneys called the investigation ""absurd and groundless"" and a ""grave interference"" in Berlusconi's private life. Milan prosecutors started the investigation of this case in December after the premier called police and urged the teen's release from prison. She had been arrested in May on charges of theft. Prosecutors also sent police to search the home of Nicole Minetti, a member of Berlusconi's party and a Lombardy regional council member. Berlusconi allegedly asked Minetti to serve as Ruby's tutor so the girl would be able to leave prison. Minetti is under investigation for allegedly favoring and aiding juvenile prostitution, prosecutors said. The teen is now 18 and is considered an adult. The premier has always denied having any involvement with any prostitutes or helping prostitution or having wild parties at this house. The latest investigation emerges after Italy's Constitutional Court struck down last week key parts of a law that would protect Berlusconi from prosecution. The law was designed to halt criminal proceedings against top government officials for 18 months on the grounds that they are too busy to appear in court. But Italy's top court ruled that judges, not politicians, should be the ones to determine if a defendant is free to appear in court. Separate trials against Berlusconi are pending. He's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another. Both trials began but were suspended when the immunity law was passed. Berlusconi has called the charges politically motivated. A third case against the prime minister, also related to tax fraud, is in preliminary stages. Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994, but he remains very popular with the Italian public. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Italy's prime minister is accused of sex with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer .

"New York (CNN) -- A Broadway actor who fell more than 20 feet during an aerial stunt in the musical ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,"" has been released from a rehabilitation center in New York, a show spokesman said. Christopher Tierney, 31, was released from New York University's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine on Wednesday morning, according to spokesperson Sam Corbett. Tierney was moved into the institute after being discharged from Bellevue Hospital on December 28. He suffered four broken ribs, a hairline skull fracture, a broken scapula, or shoulder blade; a bruised lung, three cracked vertebrae and broken bones below his elbow as a result of his fall, his father said. ""He is up,"" Tim Tierney said. ""He is walking and just doing very well."" He noted that his son is looking forward to returning to the show. Several of the performances were canceled following the December 20 incident, as new safety measures were put in place following a meeting with officials from the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Tierney said Tuesday that he is looking forward to returning to the show and is not concerned about his own safety. ""I'm not worried about it,"" he said. ""They've got it well taken care of."" Another actor in the show, Patrick Page, said the new measures have increased communication between actors and safety personnel. The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and The Edge, is said to be the most expensive in Broadway history. But the behind-the-scenes drama at the $65 million production ­-- including a series of mishaps resulting in actor injuries -- has continued to raise questions over its safety record.","Christopher Tierney, 31, has been released from a rehabilitation center in New York .

"(CNN) -- The tiny corpses, faces pale and grimy, lay side by side, wrapped in a red blanket. They are the latest child casualties in the bloody Syrian civil war. They are also grisly evidence of the carnage in the besieged Syrian city of Daraya over the weekend. Published Monday by the opposition outlet Shaam News Network, the image underscores the horrors in Daraya. At least 245 people were found dead in the Damascus suburb over the weekend, opposition activists say. Mass killings have been reported regularly across Syria during the nearly 18-month-long crisis. Like the others, this incident sparked international outrage. The killings in Daraya need to be investigated ""immediately and impartially,"" said U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky, passing along remarks from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ""Whoever is responsible needs to be held accountable,"" Nesirky said. ""Daraya is being targeted because it is the closest to the capital, and it is one of the first cities that revolted against the Assad regime and was the spearhead of the peaceful demonstrations in the beginning of the revolution,"" said Rafif Jouejati, a spokeswoman for the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Opponents of the Syrian regime posted video of mass burials Sunday, a day after the remains were found in Daraya. In one of the videos, one woman shouted "" 'God is greater' as soldiers raided her house,"" an opposition member who goes by the name Abu Kanan said from the city. ""The soldiers arrested her with five men from her family and executed them."" The remains of the dead were gathered in a mosque to be identified, and rebel fighters posted video of dozens of bloodied corpses online. The ""army started picking up young men from the streets, from their homes, and conducted summary executions"" before government troops pulled back to the city's outskirts Sunday night, he said. State-run and pro-government TV networks aired glowing descriptions of Daraya's recapture by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after a weeklong siege. It blamed the deaths on ""terrorists"" driven out by the army. Opposition activists said the dead were victims of a rampage by government troops after the rebel Free Syrian Army withdrew from the city late Friday. The LCC said the 39 corpses of people kidnapped and slaughtered were handed over to to families Monday. Syrian television aired a different account, showing residents who thanked government troops for coming to their rescue amid bodies still sprawled in the streets. ""Thanks to the military who is protecting us,"" one man told the pro-government network Al-Dounia. ""Thank you for coming."" ""Every time we get into a region where the terrorists were present, we discover what these terrorists know best -- killings, massacres and all in the name of freedom,"" the report said. The development has prompted international revulsion. The French Foreign Ministry said Monday it is ""deeply shocked by the discovery of mass graves"" in ""what appears to be a massacre of civilians."" Daraya was the scene of some of the first peaceful protests that were attacked by security forces in al-Assad's clampdown on opposition that began in March 2011 and became a civil war. CNN cannot independently verify reports of death tolls, as the Syrian regime has severely limited access by international journalists. In other developments: . Chemical weapons use would justify intervention, France says . France warned the Syrian regime that using chemical weapons could be grounds for intervention. ""We remain vigilant with our allies to prevent the use of chemical weapons by the regime which for the international community would be a legitimate reason for direct intervention,"" President Francois Hollande said Monday in a speech to French ambassadors. Britain and the United States have said they would ""revisit"" their approach to Syria if the Syrian government uses chemical weapons, the British prime minister's office said last week. Prime Minister David Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama spoke by phone late Wednesday and agreed that the use of chemical weapons would be ""completely unacceptable,"" the office said. Obama said this week that the Syrian government would risk crossing a ""red line"" and invite U.S. military intervention if it uses chemical weapons. Hollande also urged the Syrian opposition to form a provisional government that would be ""a legitimate representative of the new Syria. We ask our Arab partners to accelerate this step, and France will recognize the provisional Syria government once it has been formed."" Government helicopter crashes near Damascus as deaths mount . An attack helicopter burst into flames and crashed in the Damascus suburb of Jobar on Monday, apparently after rebels fired on it, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of videos posted on the reported crash. Meanwhile, at least 231 people were killed Monday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. At least 148 of the deaths were in Damascus and its suburbs, including 42 in Zamalka. Other deaths were reported in the provinces of Homs, Deir Ezzor, Hama, Daraa and Idlib. The LCC reported a siege on the town of Madeeq Citadel in Hama and shelling across the country. ""Regime forces are intensely shelling the old quarters of Homs, a district under siege for 81 consecutive days,"" the LCC said. The United Nations has estimated the death toll at more than 18,000, while opposition forces say more than 21,000 have died. Refugee crisis worsens in Jordan and Turkey . UNICEF is appealing for more money to help the throng of Syrian refugees escaping to Jordan. About 17,000 people -- half of them children -- are sheltered at Za'atari refugee camp in northern Jordan, but numbers are increasing daily with hundreds of new arrivals from Syria, the agency said. Syrians fleeing violence have been racing to Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq and to safe locations inside the country. ""We expect to have 70,000 people at Za'atari camp by the end of this year,"" said Dominique Hyde, a UNICEF Jordan representative. ""We must act now because it is children who continue to suffer most."" So far, some 80,000 refugees have fled to Turkey and that number is expected to rise above 100,000 in the coming days and weeks, said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. ""The outflows out of Syria are growing both into Turkey and to Jordan and to all the neighboring states,"" she said, adding that Turkey is increasingly open to receiving international aid. Government reports gains in Aleppo . Soldiers in Aleppo on Monday ""cleared al-Izaa neighborhood"" of ""terrorists,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said. ""The security forces stormed a den for the armed terrorist groups in al-Inzarat Neighborhood in Aleppo and seized a huge amount of ammunition and weapons. SANA's reporter in Aleppo said that the seized weapons include PKC machine guns, Russian rifles, pump-action shotguns, ammunition and a large quantity of bombs."" Government forces and their allies have been fighting rebels for control of Syria's largest city. The LCC reported ""fierce artillery shelling by regime forces"" in Aleppo's Bab district. Coming Tuesday: Report about life after al-Assad . A report with recommendations on a post-Assad Syria will be released Tuesday. The U.S. Institute for Peace and the Germany Institute for International Security Affairs have produced ""The Day After Project: Supporting a Democratic Transition in Syria."" The effort includes Syrians across the spectrum of the opposition, including senior members of the Syrian National Council and the Local Coordination Committees of Syria; former generals, economists and lawyers; and representatives from the Syrian diaspora. The project was a year in the making, the LCC's Jouejati said on Twitter. It will contain recommendations that Syrians can ""accept, reject or restate,"" she said. Among the recommendations: Writing a new constitution, establishing stability and putting together a special tribunal to try regime members, Jouejati said. They also include mention of South Africa's transition from apartheid, she confirmed. The peace institute facilitated the Iraq Study Group report, which made recommendations in 2006 on ending the war there. Will Syria's first lady take a stand or stand by her man?

"(CNN) -- After 18 months of terror and grave devastation, Syrian children are plagued with trauma from witnessing the horrors of war firsthand, an international aid group says. Save the Children released a report on Tuesday called ""Untold Atrocities,"" a collection of accounts from Syrian refugee children. ""A massacre took place in my village. Around 25 people were killed -- I witnessed it with my own eyes,"" said Mohamad, 15, who has fled to Jordan with his family. ""They used different ways to kill people -- electric shocks, throwing machinery and cement blocks on people's heads."" Hassan, 14, described the use of children as human shields, echoing reports from opposition activists that the Syrian regime had done so. He said his cousin and uncle died when a rocket ""caused a massacre."" ""Almost every child we've spoken to has seen family members killed,"" Save the Children said. Even those who survive attacks face dire circumstances. ""When we were being bombed, we had nothing. No food, no water, no toys -- nothing. There was no way to buy food -- the markets and shops were bombed out,"" Ala'a, 10, said. ""My father went without food for days because there wasn't enough. I remember watching him tie his stomach with rope so he wouldn't feel so hungry."" Wael, 16, summarized the trauma this way: . ""I have seen children slaughtered. I don't think I'll ever be OK again."" In other developments: . Diplomatic front: Obama pledges support, Qatar offers a new plan for Syria . U.S. President Barack Obama used his keynote speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday to pledge American support for those working for a ""common good"" for Syria -- and sanctions against those doing harm. ""In Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator who massacres his people,"" he said. ""If there is a cause that cries out for protest in the world today, it is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment buildings. And we must remain engaged to assure that what began with citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence."" French President Francois Hollande also had strong words on Syria, saying that areas ""liberated"" by opposition forces should be protected by the United Nations. ""There have been almost 30,000 deaths in the last 18 months -- how many more deaths will we wait for before we act? How can we allow the paralysis of the United Nations to continue?"" he asked. Hollande said France would recognize an opposition government once it is formed, and that the current regime had lost its right to represent the country on the international stage. France has been at the forefront of international efforts to bring about a resolution in Syria. In his address to the General Assembly, Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani said the violence in Syria had reached ""an unacceptable phase"" and urged fellow Arab nations to intervene. ""We have used all available means to get Syria out of the cycle of killing, but that was in vain,"" he said. In light of the U.N. Security Council's failure to act effectively, he said, ""It is better for the Arab countries themselves to interfere out of their national, humanitarian, political and military duties and do what it necessary to stop the bloodshed in Syria ... in order to guarantee a peaceful transition of power in Syria."" His words come a day after he proposed a ""Plan B"" for solving the Syrian crisis, saying a nonviolent solution is still possible despite more than a year of relentless bloodshed. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday, Al Thani said the plan would include havens -- which would require a no-fly zone -- and greater humanitarian aid. ""We wish and we believe that we can solve it peacefully,"" Al Thani said. But, he said, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has only one solution: ""killing his people to win the war."" ""I believe within weeks, we should have a Plan B. And there is a responsibility among us,"" he said. ""We are talking about saving the people of Syria."" UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, who spoke to Amanpour on Tuesday, described the situation in the U.N. Security Council with respect to Syria as being at a ""diplomatic impasse."" ""We are blocked in the United Nations Security Council from the world being able to put its full weight behind a transitional government in Syria, something that it is obvious solution, obviously part of the solution,"" he said. Hague was referring to Russia and China, which have repeatedly blocked draft resolutions that would take stronger action against al-Assad's regime. The secretary is scheduled to meet with Russian leaders this week to discuss the ongoing crisis. On the ground: Blasts strike a Damascus compound . Dual attacks rattled a Syrian intelligence security compound in Damascus, the regime and opposition activists said Tuesday. The compound was also the site of a major explosion in March. Syrian state-run TV said the two improvised explosive devices were ""planted by terrorists"" in a school building and caused seven injuries. Opposition activists said the Syrian military was using the school building as a base. The new school year has not yet started, Syrian state TV said, so it seems unlikely that children would have been at the site. In June, Human Rights Watch described cases of ""sexual torture"" at the compound, reported by male and female detainees -- many of whom were political activists or simply attended protests. At least 148 people were killed across Syria on Tuesday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group. The highest number of deaths, 44, was reported in Damascus and its suburbs, where regime forces and rebel fighters are engaged in fierce clashes and communities are under aerial bombardment, the LCC said. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Saad Abedine, Holly Yan, Samuel Burke and Claire Calzonetti contributed to this report.","The UK foreign secretary describes the Security Council as being at an impasse .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- At least four people were killed and more than a hundred injured in fresh violence in Bangladesh as the Islamist groups clashed with police near the capital, Dhaka, on Sunday, police said. ""We've confirmed four deaths in Singair of Manikganj so far,"" district police chief Mohammad Ali Mia told CNN. Manikganj district is 60 kilometers (about 37 miles) west of Dhaka. Police said Sunday was largely peaceful across Bangladesh except in Manikganj, where several thousand Islamists took to the streets and attacked police with lethal weapons and firearms. Police fired nearly 300 gunshots and 50 tear-gas shells in a bid to disperse the angry mob who gathered there after an imam of a local mosque used a loudspeaker to ask them to rally against bloggers they accused of insulting the Prophet Mohammed, calling them anti-Islamic elements. Mia said that 21 police officers were injured, including the officer-in-charge of a local police station, Liaquat Ali. Meanwhile in Dhaka, hundreds of protesters in the city's Shahbagh Square took to the street and brought out a procession rejecting the strike called by Islamist groups on Sunday. A coalition of 12 Islamist parties enforced a general strike across Bangladesh on Sunday to protest the killing of four of its supporters when police fired during a blasphemy protest on Friday. In a recent spate of violence, at least 24 people have been killed in less than three weeks in response to a war crimes trial verdict announced on February 5 that sentenced a Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party leader Abdul Quader Mollah to life imprisonment. Tens of thousands of people, mostly young, occupied Dhaka's Shahbagh Square immediately and demanded death penalty for those involved in wartime crimes perpetrated more than four decades ago, while Jamaat called a series of strikes demanding that the trial process be dismissed and calling it ""politically motivated.""","Four killed, scores hurt, including 21 police officers, in protests near capital .

Those who were at Kentucky's Churchill Downs that May day in 2006 would have been forgiven for thinking that they had just witnessed the second coming of 1973 Triple Crown winner Secretariat as Barbaro took control of the race coming off the last bend. ""And here comes Barbaro!"" roared the track announcer as 120,000 people got to their feet to cheer him home. ""The jock (Edgar Prado) never hit him with the whip,"" Matz recalls. ""He was still going as he crossed the finish line. And that's when I thought we could have a Triple Crown winner."" The holy grail of horse racing was always going to be a big ask. Made up of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes, only 11 horses have ever completed the treble, and the most recent of these was Affirmed back in 1978. But the omens seemed to be in Barbaro's favor as the day of the Preakness dawned. Matze's assistant Peter Brette galloped him that morning -- ""and he couldn't have galloped any more beautifully."" ""They're going to have to have wings to catch this horse today,"" Brette told his boss. But then Barbaro did something he had never done before. After loading into stall six, the horse burst through the gate before the starter's bell, slamming into the mechanical doors with enough power to force them open. Although he was checked over by a vet and eventually reloaded, in many ways Barbaro's race was over before it began. Breaking from the starting gates for the second time that day, he ran just a few hundred meters before tragedy struck. Nobody knows for certain what caused it; the most likely explanation is a simple misstep. Just one bad stride was enough to shatter his hind leg in more than 20 places. Millions watched as Barbaro pawed the ground uncomprehendingly, his dislocated back hoof dangling uselessly behind him. Although efforts were made to save the leg with pioneering surgery, Barbaro eventually had to be put down. But now, six years after Barbaro captivated the racing world with his electrifying Kentucky Derby win, Matz is back at Churchill Downs with another bay colt, Union Rags. ""In some ways they're similar -- they're both very competitive"" the 61-year-old says. ""Union Rags has a little bit more white on his face than Barbaro did but they're both elegant-looking horses. ""He's big, he's strong, he's fast -- so far I haven't found any faults in him. I think he's got a good chance."" Brette rides the horse every day, and he agrees that they could have a second Barbaro on their hands. ""Everything just comes easily to him. He's a pleasure to ride."" Union Rags is among the hot favorites for Saturday's race. And few would begrudge Matz the fairytale ending he never had with Barbaro. ""As a trainer that's what we live for. To know that you had one horse that could win the Kentucky Derby and possibly two -- it's a great feeling.""","U.S. horse trainer Michael Matz seeking to win his second Kentucky Derby on Saturday .

"Binnish, Syria (CNN) -- Hundreds of men and boys kneeled on the floor of a packed mosque for Friday prayers, but the solemn religious rite quickly turned into a furious rain-soaked rally denouncing Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad. Before completing their prayers, the congregation murmured words of condolences for a resident of this small opposition-held village, Muhamed Hasmus. Activists say Hasmus was killed Friday morning by a sniper in the nearby city of Idlib, an account CNN could not independently confirm. The remembrance of their neighbor caused the faithful to jump to their feet and erupt with the chant ""Allahu Akbar,"" which means God is great. They repeated their full-throated chants as they marched from the mosque to the village square in a pounding, freezing rainstorm. They unfurled banners, waved the opposition green, black and white flag, and conducted a ritual of defiance that has been repeated weekly in this opposition enclave for months. ""Our first demonstration was on April 1st,"" Ibrahim Qobani told CNN. ""I have never missed a single demonstration since."" The 19-year-old Qobani led the latest demonstration in Binnish, which has been experimenting with self-rule. He stood on a rooftop with a microphone, dressed in a scarf and fingerless gloves knit with the colors of the opposition flag, and sang verses insulting the Syrian president. ""This is a tool for us to show the world that we need support,"" he said. ""During the week when I'm talking to the guys (opposition activists) over the internet, I think about what to chant on Friday."" This week, Qobani introduced new lyrics to protest songs. He replaced the word ""hurriye,"" which means freedom, which made up the chorus of a popular Syrian protest song, with the word ""harbiye,"" which means 'war.' ""We were peaceful for ten months But now there is no other solution. We will fight, even with knives,"" said 21-year-old university student who only wanted his first name Hussam published, for security reasons. Wearing an opposition scarf around his forehead, Hussam had little positive to say about the U.N. General Assembly's non-binding resolution endorsing an Arab League plan for al-Assad to step down. ""We didn't watch real action from the United Nations and all the world actually. They are just speeches, they do not help us,"" he said. One of the protest organizers had kinder words for the U.N. resolution. ""It sends a strong message to Damascus and to Russia and China that the world is against the Assad regime,"" said Ala Edien Hamdoun, who leads the local opposition council's public relations committee. Hamdoun said he was well aware that the latest diplomatic broadside against Damascus would do little protect this small, defiant community should the Syrian military mount an all-out assault. Just a few kilometers away, within sight of Binnish, the Syrian government flag flies in the heart of the city of Idlib, the capital of Idlib province. Opposition fighters have raised the rebel flag just a few hundred yards from the government banner, which is also visible in the city center. Heavy machine gun fire from Idlib periodically echoes across the countryside, and tracer bullets can be seen arcing out of the city at night. Binnish residents say the Syrian army maintains a base about five minutes away from their village's central square. Leaders of the rebellion in Binnish say the army doubled the number of tanks at that base over the last 24 hours. That deployment raised fears of a possible imminent attack on this opposition enclave.","Binnish is an opposition-held village .

"(CNN) -- Are Australian sports fans the toughest in the world? They would certainly give the English football press a run for their money. They don't like you if you're too good. But they can't abide if you're rubbish either. Admittedly I have only been in the country for five days. And with an office full of Australian cameraman, I'm more than aware that I'm putting myself in line for some thoroughly unflattering camera angles in the days to come. But this is what I have learned. Take ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" for starters. It's a new phrase I've discovered. The urban dictionary says it's Australian slang to criticize highly successful people and cut them down to size. I was taught it by virtually the only fan supporting Victoria Azarenka in the Australian Open women's final at the Rod Laver Arena on Saturday night. It was her explanation for the icy reception the Belorussian received. Yes, Vika had upset a few people with her medical time out in her semi. But she'd fronted up to all the questions she was asked, and admitted she'd made a mistake. And Sloane Stephens said it hadn't bothered her two hoots. Here she was fighting her heart out to stay as the world No. 1 and defend her grand slam title -- at just 23 years of age. If the crowd had stopped booing for long enough, they might have seen she played some frankly brilliant tennis. What happened to marveling at excellence? Homegrown talent doesn't fare much better, though. He's still some way from a grand slam title, but 20-year-old Bernard Tomic got further than any other Australian player at the opening grand slam of the year. He beat eventual winner and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic just a couple of weeks ago as well. But my taxi driver on Thursday told me he was rubbish. Cast your mind back too, to the early days of Ian Thorpe's swimming career, and the pressures he faced at just 15, after becoming the youngest male world champion. But if you can't win by winning, you'd think they back the underdog. But no, that doesn't always seem to be the case either. Australian rugby fan Andrew Marmont on sports website Roar gives us a list of things he'd rather do instead of watching the Wallabies get beaten by the All Blacks -- again. It includes vacuuming, and washing the car. I'm a woman, and I'll take the sport every time. Why not throw a party, sing your heart out and marvel in plucky failure once again. The Brits have been doing it for years. Take Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards -- the first British ski-jumper at the Winter Olympics. In 1988 he became a national hero -- as a loser. It's not just Australia though. Spain and Italy have some of the most passionate, positive football supporters in the world. Until their teams lose two or three games. Then watch the tide turn. But I suppose at least they care. I found a trip to the basketball in Miami to be one of the strangest sporting experiences of my life. It was the Heat against the Clippers in early 2007. Quite a big game at the time. But you wouldn't have known it inside the American Airlines Arena. Fans turned up as and when they liked, or popped their heads in for a quarter, and then headed back to the popcorn stand. Very odd. They've definitely got passion here. I saw that up close and personal as a few hundred Sydney FC fans arrived in Melbourne to see their team take on Melbourne Victory. You could hear their songs from half a mile away as they approached the ground. And I have to say, Alessandro Del Piero told me he's loving the fans here. He joked that he's being asked for about a thousand autographs a day since his move from Serie A to the A-League. But he doesn't mind because he's being asked nicely. I'll give them that. The thing about Australia is that on the whole, it loves sport. The people know sport. They have a lot of it here. Not just the Australian Open tennis, but cricket, F1's Australian Grand Prix, horse racing's Melbourne Cup, Aussie Rules Football, rugby league, and soccer's A-League. What I don't understand is that there's so much to celebrate. But maybe when you have a horse like Black Caviar, human endeavor is just never going to be good enough. PS. This is no reflection of the welcome I've had during my time in Australia! I've had a truly wonderful visit -- and very much look forward to coming back soon!","Australia is world renowned as a country which is passionate about sport .

"London (CNN) -- Despite Turkey's shelling of Syria, Middle East expert Fawaz Gerges says neither side wants an escalation of a conflict that has the potential to spill over into a regional war that would be extremely difficult to end. It is important to stress at the outset that we do not know if the shells that landed on Turkish border towns, killing at least five people, were ordered by Bashar al-Assad's government; all we know is the shelling came from the area where Syrian positions had been firing at rebels. Syria has admitted its shelling killed Turkish civilians, has apologized, and has promised that the incident will not be repeated, Turkey's deputy prime minister says. Syria's information minister has pledged an investigation into how and why the shell came to be fired at Turkey. The big point is that the Assad regime is desperately trying to prevent outside military intervention in its war-torn country, and does not want to provide a pretext for Turkey to do so, knowing that it would be disastrous. News: Turkey strikes targets in retaliation for shelling deaths . Similarly, I believe the Turkish government has no interest in military escalation against its neighbor. According to surveys, public opinion in Turkey is strongly against all-out war with Syria. Equally important is the fact that, although NATO and the United States have expressed solidarity with Turkey, a NATO member, they are urging restraint. Western powers, particularly the United States, do not have the desire or political will to intervene militarily in Syria. Without the full backing of NATO and the US, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan would be reluctant to embark on any large-scale military venture against Syria. So while we have seen a lot of escalation in the last 48 hours we need to put it into context: Neither side has an interest in turning this low-intensity war into something more serious, a full-blown confrontation. What the incident tells us is that Syria has now descended into all-out war. It tells us that Syria's neighbors are deeply embroiled in its internal armed struggle. It also tells us that the civil war has become a proxy war between other regional players such as Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Syrian conflict has also been internationalized along Cold War lines, with the US and Russia backing rival camps. The spillover of the Syrian war has reached not just Turkey but also Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq, with frequent armed clashes and casualties. If these skirmishes intensify and escalate, the potential of a region-wide war cannot be overlooked. World: Syrian refugees in Turkey -- police are forcing us from homes . This is why Western powers, particularly the United States, are reluctant to intervene militarily in the Syrian civil war, lest they exacerbate an already dangerous situation: They want the civil war to remain an internal conflict where it can be contained. Al-Assad's strategy has succeeded: He has forced the opposition to militarize the political uprising. Syria is in the grip of a bloody and costly armed struggle, a struggle that does not show signs of an early resolution, but of turning into a long, drawn-out conflict. No one knows how that would end, but it would ensure he has local and regional support to survive for quite a long time. The Syrian authorities have little control over all military engagements. The fire has spread across the whole country: Assad's forces are over-extended and thinly spread. Despite assurances given by the Syrian government that the shelling that killed the Turkish civilians won't be repeated, it is doubtful whether that pledge can be honored as Syria descends into all-out war. Turkey has been extremely angry in the last few weeks. For the first time Prime Minister Recep Tayip Reccip Erdogan has criticized the Western powers for paying lip service to the opposition cause, implying that his patience is running thin. Regardless of how the Turkish leadership feels though, I don't think it will act independently without a security umbrella commitment by NATO and a green light from the Americans. They have made it very clear they will not act on their own against Syria. NATO has gone out of its way to impress gently on the Turkish leadership not to escalate the situation beyond what it has done so far.

"(CNN) -- An attorney for Elisa Baker, the stepmother accused of killing 10-year-old Zahra Baker, said Monday he plans to file for a change of venue because of the publicity the North Carolina case has received. Elisa Baker was indicted in February on second-degree murder charges in the girl's death. She previously was charged with obstruction of justice after police said she admitted to planting a fake ransom note. Baker nearly collapsed during a court appearance Monday in Catawba County, North Carolina, CNN Charlotte affiliate WSOC reported. After standing in front of a judge for nearly 15 minutes, Baker, who was in shackles, became unsteady on her feet, nearly hitting her head on a table before her attorney grabbed her, according to WSOC. Defense attorney Scott Reilly told ""In Session"" he did not see most of what occurred because he was addressing the judge, but he confirmed Baker was taken from the courtroom to be checked by medical staff. Reilly said the next court date is June 27. ""In Session"" left a message with the district attorney's office. Zahra Baker was reported missing from her Hickory, North Carolina, home in October 2010; some of her dismembered remains were found a month later. Elisa Baker, 42, ""desecrated the victim's body to hinder detection, investigation and prosecution of the offense,"" the indictment against her said. The indictment described Zahra as ""very young, physically infirm, or handicapped."" The girl lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both ears while being treated for cancer. ""The defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence, including a domestic relationship, to commit the offense,"" the indictment said.

"(CNN) -- This weekend ""The Avengers"" hit the $1 billion mark worldwide. But long before the film's astronomical success, the 3-D glasses, the action figures and the sponsorship deals, there was the the imagination of one man -- Stan Lee. At 89, the legendary creator of some of the world's most profitable comic book characters remains quick-witted, rapturously imaginative and always laughing -- even if, as far as ""The Avengers"" is concerned, he's not laughing all the way to the bank. Lee recently talked to CNN's JD Cargill in an exclusive interview about the film, which of his characters he'd like to see next on the big screen, some of his current projects, and why we shouldn't assume he is now a billionaire. JD Cargill: Even the craziest estimates didn't predict this much success for ""The Avengers."" What is your reaction to creating some of the most profitable characters in entertainment? Stan Lee: Oh, I could have told everybody it was going to be this big of a hit! I don't know why they couldn't have predicted it. It couldn't miss! It's got some of the most popular characters in the world today. You put together a great script, a great director, great actors and a cameo by me -- how could it miss? Cargill: Not including your cameo of course, what's the film's ultimate moment for you? Lee: When they all come together and decide to fight as a team. I'm all heart! Years ago, I was writing these characters and I thought it would fun to put them together in a team. And I called it ""The Avengers."" And I thought, they have to have some sort of rallying cry. So I loved the idea of them shouting -- because I'm a very corny guy -- ""Avengers assemble!"" Cargill: Obviously with a project of this magnitude, compromises have to be made along the way. Tell me about one moment in the film you had to bend on. Lee: It might be hard to believe, but there really wasn't a part. Not only did they omit something I might not have wanted to be in, they included things that I never thought of and were wonderful. I thought this movie was as perfect as a movie like this can be. Cargill: When fans see Marvel characters making record-breaking (box office) money like this, they assume it's made you a billionaire. How close is that to the truth? Lee: I hate to admit this, but I do not share in the movie's profits. I just share in the interviews, in the glamour, in the people saying, ""Wow, I love that movie, Stan"" -- but I'm not a participant in the profits. Cargill: But aren't you an executive producer? Lee: Yes, but it's just an honorary title. Cargill: Do you you wish you were making more money off of it? Lee: Well, it would be nice. (laughs) But I'm used to the way the situation is. I don't go around thinking about it. I am really very pleased that people enjoy the movie, that it's doing well, and even though I didn't film the movie myself, I seem to be getting a lot of credit for it! (laughs) Cargill: Of all your beloved comic characters, which one would you like to see become a big-screen icon next? Lee: I can't wait to see Dr. Strange and The Black Panther. Cargill: Are those in the works? Lee: I have a feeling they very well might be. They're certainly being considered right now. Cargill: What's the one character you wish you had created? Lee: Well, it would have been nice to come up with Superman! (laughs)Â . Cargill: Experiencing highs and lows is part of every life and career. At this moment, what do you see as your high and what do you see as your low? Lee: Well, I suppose today the success of ""The Avengers"" is one of the highs. And there was a time, many many years ago, when the comic book business went bad and it looked as though Marvel was going to go out of business. We didn't call it Marvel then. It was called ""Timely Comics."" I had a publisher that was a great guy, but he didn't like unpleasantness. So he would say to me, ""Stan, I can't afford to put the books out anymore for the next few months. I'd like for you to fire the staff while I go to Miami."" It was always my job to fire the staff while he ducked away somewhere. That was certainly a low because these were people I worked with. These were friends. I had to let them know there would be no work for the foreseeable future. But luckily we were able to build the company back up again and start over again and give these guys work once more. Cargill: Poll after poll ranks ""Iron Man"" as the favorite Avenger. Do you have another character in the works that will rival his popularity? Lee: Here at POW! Entertainment, with my partner Gill Champion, we're working on quite a number of new movies, television series and even a live action show. Three of the new superheroes, and I can't say too much right now, but the working titles are ""The Prodigal,"" one is called ""The Annihilator,"" and one is called ""The Retaliator."" And each one of them, I say in modesty, is better than the others! (laughs) Cargill: You can't tell me anything about them? Lee: I will say that ""The Annihilator"" is a Chinese superhero, probably the first one done by an American studio, and it's not a Chinese film. It's a film for the entire world. It's got an angle we've never seen before and it's written by Dan Gilroy, one of our top writers. ""The Retaliator"" has a different angle and the element of ecology is important in that story. But he's the kind of superhero with a power that nobody has seen. ""The Prodigal"" is really two superheroes that are part of the same family, but they become ultimate enemies! Those are just the three movies we have in the works. We also have a number of comic books coming that will probably end up as movies or television series or so forth. Cargill: Are you talking about ""The Mighty 7"" and ""Titanic 10""? Lee: Oh, you are so hip! ""The Mighty 7"" is being published by Archie. There are seven characters. Two of them are police officers from another planet. The other five are fugitives that they were bringing back somewhere and they all land on Earth through an accident and they meet me! We refer to this as the world's first reality comic book, because it has real people, starting with me. But it's still very much a superhero story. Also, like ""The Avengers,"" we also have ""The Titanic 10."" This is 10 superheroes living in today's world, faced with the same problems that you and I are faced with, and suddenly something happens that has never happened before in any superhero story. I am incredibly proud of this and you'll be hearing a lot more, because it's the type of thing when people see it they'll say, ""Of course, why didn't I think of that!"" If that doesn't whet your appetite, I quit! Cargill: There comes a time in all our lives where we select someone to speak on our behalf. Of all of your characters, who would you have speak on your behalf and what do you imagine them saying? Lee: Wow. Maybe Iron Man, maybe Tony Stark. Only because of all of them, I think he has the best sense of humor and he's the cleverest, probably. And what would he say? God knows! (laughs) Maybe I shouldn't pick him. Maybe I shouldn't pick a guy that smart! Maybe I should pick a guy I could fool a little better. But, at first blush, I think Tony Stark would be the guy.","""The Avengers"" hit the $1 billion mark in just 19 days .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is not in a coma and is continuing to make strides in his recovery, his brother said. Chavez's brother, Adan Chavez, who is governor of Chavez's home state of Barinas, recently returned from Cuba, where the president is undergoing cancer treatment. Chavez, 58, has not made a public appearance since doctors operated on him a month ago. The long absence is not typical of the loquacious leader, who missed his own inauguration this week. ""The head of state continues to assimilate treatment well and, each day, advances in his recovery,"" said Adan Chavez, according to a statement posted Saturday by his office. He characterized as ""totally false"" rumors that Chavez is in a coma and that his family was discussing the possibility of taking him off life support. Last week, a government spokesman said Chavez was battling a severe lung infection that has caused respiratory failure. ""We are sure that with the support of God, science and the people, our president will emerge from this new battle,"" the brother said. His comments came as Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, an ally of Chavez, visited Cuba in a show of solidarity, and just days after Chavez's health problems prevented him from being in Caracas for his inauguration ceremony. Throngs of supporters swore an oath of loyalty in his absence Thursday. Vice President Nicolas Maduro called on the masses gathered to take an oath of ""absolute loyalty to the leadership of Comandante Hugo Chavez."" The crowd repeated his words, holding thousands of tiny copies of the constitution up in the air. Opposition politicians have argued that delaying Chavez's swearing-in without designating a temporary replacement leaves no legitimate leader in charge of Venezuela. Chavez allies, including a majority of lawmakers in the country's congress, have said he should remain in power while taking the time he needs to recuperate. Venezuela's Supreme Court backed the government's position, ruling that Chavez began a new term on Thursday and can be sworn in later before the court. Before he left for Cuba for surgery, Chavez said he wanted Maduro to assume the presidency if he becomes incapacitated and called on voters to support him at the polls. CNN's Dana Ford and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Adan Chavez says his brother, President Hugo Chavez, is making strides in his recovery .

"(CNN) -- Recently an op-ed by Douglas Rushkoff took up the issue of the creation of the Center for Copyright Information (CCI), a coalition charged with implementing the Copyright Alert System, a graduated response framework to copyright infringement. As the executive director of the Center, I would like to respond to several concerns that article raised about how the program will work and its goals . For background, the Copyright Alert System aims to inform consumers of inadvertent or purposeful unauthorized distribution of content over peer-to-peer networks and to help consumers find legal ways to obtain, share and enjoy movies and music protected by copyright. The program represents an unprecedented and voluntary partnership between leading Internet Service Providers (ISPs) -- AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Verizon -- and U.S. content creators -- represented by the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America -- with advice from leading consumer advocates. Gigi Sohn, president and CEO of Public Knowledge and Marsali Hancock, president, iKeepSafe.org, sit on our advisory board, to name just two. This system reflects a new reality: The Internet has forever changed how content is consumed, making content easy to find, use and experience. Our work at CCI is about educating consumers about how to legally and ethically enjoy the movies and music they love. As Rushkoff says: ""The longer term solution would be to develop an appropriate social contract: conducting ourselves online under the same civilized behavioral norms that keep us from, say, stealing stuff from one another's homes even though we could probably get away with it."" It's beyond this premise that I take issue with Rushkoff's article. The article's headline: ""Will your Internet provider be spying on you?"" indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the program and how it works; it suggests that ISPs would engage in an activity anathema to their consumers to protect copyright. Now that doesn't sound like the ISPs that I know. Opinion: Will your Internet provider be spying on you? The role of the ISPs in the new Copyright Alert System will be to pass on notices sent by copyright holders to those subscribers whose Internet protocol addresses (strings of numbers that mean little to most people ) have been associated with allegedly illegal file sharing. As they have done for years, content owners will use technical methodologies to identify alleged infringements over peer-to-peer networks and will request that notices of such alleged infringement be passed on to subscribers by the participating ISPs. To be clear: No personal information at all, including the identity of the subscriber, will be shared with the content owners by the ISPs. What the ISPs will do, in recognition of the importance of copyright protection generally, is to then provide their subscribers with education and information about what not to do and how to get content in the right way. The alerts will be non-punitive -- 4-6 in total, depending on the ISP -- but progressive in scale. If the activity stops, the alerts stop. Initial alerts will focus on making the consumer aware of the activity and highlighting legal ways to enjoy content. The alerts are designed with particular attention to key groups -- parents of teens, for example -- to provide the most helpful and actionable information possible. Alerts that require acknowledgment of receipt of the alert follow and -- in some cases -- the system also includes mitigation measures, which vary between ISPs. These may include temporary reduction of Internet speed or redirection to a landing page until the subscriber contacts the ISP or reviews educational information. The CAS will only address activity over to peer-to-peer programs such as BitTorrent -- not streaming video or other general online content. The system is based on consumers' ""right to know"" when their Internet account is being used for illegal file sharing through peer-to-peer networks, or if their own online activity infringes on copyrights -- inadvertently or otherwise -- so that they can correct that activity. The alert system is similar to warnings and alerts in place for stolen credit cards. The unfortunate reality of malware and other potential dangers on peer-to-peer programs makes this service to subscribers particularly important. Going beyond the nuts and bolts of the program, the Center for Copyright Information's primary goal is educational. The program is designed to provide non-punitive tools that will help inform consumers about how to legally enjoy digital copyrighted content and avoid illegal peer-to-peer networks, through a system based on information and deterrence. As Rushkoff points out, ""in many cases the Internet subscriber might have no knowledge of the infraction"" and he goes on to describe how a houseguest might share illegal content without the Internet subscriber's knowledge. But that's exactly the point. Many subscribers, particularly parents or caregivers, are not aware that their accounts are being used to distribute illegal -- and sometimes harmful -- content through peer-to-peer networks. That ignorance doesn't make it acceptable. What we need to do is help subscribers better understand what they can and cannot do and help them get the compelling and entertaining movies and music from the constantly expanding collection of legal services now in the marketplace. With methods for sharing content constantly evolving, the Copyright Alert System is designed to address an information gap. From homeowners who want to make sure their wireless networks are secure to parents concerned about their children's activity on the internet, information and tools can help users better consume content. In the coming months, we are eager to share our effort to close this information gap. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jill Lesser.","Jill Lesser: Earlier op-ed imputed sinister intent to a new Copyright Alert System; there is none.

"(CNN) -- A French man jailed for an alleged plot to kill Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in 2009 was deported to France on Saturday, a Venezuelan official said. Frederic Laurent Bouquet's expulsion was announced via a tweet by Iris Varela, the minister for the prison system. ""Frederic Laurent Bouquet was sentenced to four years (in Venezuelan jail), after confessing to plotting against Chavez. He had an arsenal in his possession"" Varela tweeted. According to Venezuelan state-run National Radio and the state-run Venezuelan TV station, Bouquet was arrested in 2009 with three men from the Dominican Republic. He had multiple guns as well as explosives and other military gear with him, according to reports. ""This arrest is a serious blow to terrorism and to those groups that seek to drag into Venezuela scenes of blood and confrontation,"" Tarek El Aissami, then-interior minister, told reporters at the time. El Aissami at the time said Bouquet had military experience and had spent some time in Israel. He also said Bouquet was presumed to be a French intelligence agent. In her tweet, Varela said Bouquet's deportation complies with a Venezuelan law that allows the government to expel anyone who jeopardizes the security and defense of the nation.","Officials say Bouquet confessed to the plot .

"(CNN) -- Fierce political rhetoric in Venezuela took a sharp turn Wednesday with a warning from Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told throngs of supporters that opponents were plotting to murder him. ""We are denouncing this because we have strong evidence,"" Maduro said at a large rally marking the 1958 fall of Venezuela's dictatorship. ""So don't get surprised with the actions we will take in the next few hours and the next few days."" It's unclear what actions he was referring to, but the Venezuelan vice president said he was committed to cracking down on ""criminals who have infiltrated the country"" that allegedly plan to kill him and Diosdado Cabello, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly. Maduro's comments came as Venezuela's opposition was also rallying in Caracas on a day that has important political significance in the South American country, the anniversary of the end of Marcos Perez Jimenez's dictatorship. President Hugo Chavez has spoken at past January 23 events, but the Venezuelan leader remains in Cuba and has not made any public appearances for more than six weeks since he underwent cancer surgery there. His long absence has fueled growing speculation about his health and political future. Chavez ally: Ailing president undergoing physical therapy . Political opponents have questioned who is running Venezuela while Chavez is gone. Venezuela's government has offered conflicting assessments of the situation but maintained that Chavez is in charge. On Tuesday, Venezuela's information minister said that Chavez was making encouraging progress, but there was no date planned for his return to Caracas. Maduro told the crowd Wednesday that Chavez was ""pressing on uphill"" as he recovers from cancer surgery in Havana, Cuba. A large picture of the president hung behind Venezuelan leaders on a stage at Wednesday's rally. Maduro said he would head to Cuba to visit Chavez later in the day. In an incendiary speech, he called for the use of an iron fist. ""He who makes a mistake has to go to prison. He who violates the constitution and the peace of this country has to go to prison. And don't you come back crying after the fact and claiming to be political prisoners,"" Maduro said. ""Iron fist against the conspiracy of the right. Iron fist of all the people, the government and the powers."" Venezuelan army backs Chavez amid uncertainty . He accused infiltrators of a conspiracy to pit him and Cabello against each other. ""They've orchestrated a macabre and criminal plot with the purpose of killing us, something they won't be able to achieve,"" he said. ""Their plan is to kill one of us and then blame the other for it. That's what they're planning to do."" Political rhetoric in Venezuela is often intense. On the campaign trail last year, it was not uncommon for Chavez to sprinkle speeches with insults aimed at his political rival, opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski. Before masses of supporters and in state television interviews broadcast nationwide, Chavez described Capriles as a ""dirty swine"" and a ""fly"" who was not worth chasing. He called him a ""little Yankee"" and assailed him as a member of the bourgeoisie. During Chavez's absence in recent weeks, government officials have repeatedly accused political opponents of trying to destabilize the country with a campaign of rumors about the president's health.","Venezuelan vice president: ""Don't get surprised by the actions we will take""

"(CNN) -- What will we see in 2013? One thing for sure: The year will begin with Chief Justice John Roberts and President Obama getting two chances to recite the oath correctly. After that, here are my guesses. 1. Same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court. There are two cases, and there are a Rubik's Cube-worth of possibilities for their outcomes. On one extreme, the court could say that the federal government (in the Defense of Marriage Act) and the states can ban or allow same-sex marriage as they prefer. On the other end, the Court could rule that gay people have a constitutional right to marry in any state in the union. (Or somewhere in between.) 2. The future of affirmative action. In a case pending before the Supreme Court, the Court could outlaw all affirmative action in admissions at public universities, with major implications for all racial preferences in all school or non-school settings. 3. Gun control returns to the agenda. The Congress (and probably some states) will wrestle with the question of gun control, an issue that had largely fallen off the national agenda before the massacre in Newtown. Expect many invocations (some accurate, some not) of the Second Amendment. 4. The continued decline of the death penalty. Death sentences and executions continue to decline, and this trend will continue. Fear of mistaken executions (largely caused by DNA exonerations) and the huge cost of the death penalty process will both accelerate the shift. 5. Celebrity sex scandal. There will be one. There will be outrage, shock and amusement. (Celebrity to be identified later.)

"(CNN) -- The island nation of the Maldives -- which markets itself as one of the world's top luxury destinations -- faces uncertainty as the nation's president resigns amid the threat of violence and a rising tide of Islamic rhetoric. President Mohamed Nasheed, a former dissident who was elected in 2008 under a platform of political reform, stepped down Tuesday after members of the nation's police force revolted against his government following weeks of political protests. ""I believe if I continue as the President of the Maldives, the people of the country would suffer more,"" said Nasheed, before he handed power over to former Vice President Dr. Mohamed Waheed. But on Wednesday more violence was reported with the former president allegedly beaten along with members of his Maldivian Democratic Party, party officials said. Nasheed's supporters claim he was forced to resign at gunpoint. Former Maldives president beaten, his party says . The resignation came after three weeks of opposition protests following the arrest of a judge, which ignited a constitutional crisis. But the political tensions simmering in the island nation gained global attention last Christmas when Nasheed's government abruptly banned spas and sales of alcohol at resorts after allegations from opposition leaders of lax morals. What are the Maldives? The string of about 1,200 islands sits in Indian Ocean off the southern tip of India. A former British protectorate, the Sunni Muslim nation is home to about 350,000 people -- but the nation's pristine beaches and rich marine wildlife are popular amongst honeymooners, drawing nearly 800,000 tourists in 2010. People from around the world flock to hundreds of resorts run by the Four Seasons, Banyan Tree, the Shangri-La and other multinational luxury hotel chains. Readers of Conde Nast Traveler voted the Maldives the world's top islands destination in 2011. The Maldives has ranked as the number one destination for customers of UK tour operator Kuoni every year since 2005. Tourism makes up one-third of the economy of the Maldives, which was devastated by the 2004 South Asia tsunami, destroying several islands and costing hundreds of millions in damages. Who is Mohamed Nasheed? Nasheed became president in 2008 in what was hailed as the first truly democratic elections in the island nation's history. Nasheed, 44, defeated President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled for 30 years and remains a force in the nation's politics. Under Gayoom, Nasheed was repeatedly imprisoned for work related to critical articles he wrote about the government and other allegations of wrongdoing. He spent more than a total of six years in prison. Maldives' deposed president faces arrest . Nasheed attracted international attention in 2009 when he held a government meeting underwater, with ministers in scuba gear, to raise awareness about global warming and the threat to countries like the Maldives, which is the world's lowest lying country -- the highest point of the country stands just over two meters above sea level. How did spas cause turmoil? One of the first signs of trouble came during the Christmas holiday, when the Tourism Ministry surprised the world by banning spas across the country. The move led to a standoff over tourists' rights to have massages and skin treatments at the high-end resorts -- many of which charge thousands of dollars for a night's accommodation -- and calls from opposition groups for a stricter imposition of Islamic values in this Muslim country. The situation came to a head after opposition groups staged a demonstration on December 23 in which they advocated, among other things, for a crackdown on massage parlors in the capital, Male, and other densely populated areas. Rather than ignore the demands, the government raised the stakes by issuing an order to close all massage parlors and spas. Opposition leaders blasted the move. In a statement at the time, the president's office suggested that the broader ban was an effort to highlight contradictions in the positions of some opposition figures. ""Ironically, the same opposition leaders who railed against spas and the selling of alcohol and pork to tourists are some of the country's biggest resort owners,"" the statement said. The government reversed its decision in early January. What happened this week? On January 16, the military arrested Judge Abdulla Mohamed, the chief judge of the Maldives Criminal Court, on allegations he was controlling the judiciary of the nation and not investigating corruption charges. ""This crisis was sparked by the arrest of a senior court judge who had repeatedly refused to prosecute corruption cases in order to protect powerful allies from the former regime,"" wrote Mark Lynas, a former adviser to Nasheed, in a Tuesday op-ed in the Guardian. The United Nations stepped into the fray, saying in late January that the government should release Judge Mohamed or charge him of a crime. Meanwhile, the government sent a request to the U.N High Commissioner for Human Rights for an international panel of jurists to hear the case. ""A series of protests have been going on here by the alliance of opposition parties here and they have been calling on the government to release (Mohamed) ... this has been going on for 19 nights now,"" Maldives journalist Ahmed Rasheed told CNN on Tuesday. The protests turned violent, Rasheed said, culminating with protesters taking over the government TV station on Tuesday. Late in the day, fearing that violence would escalate, the president stepped down. On Wednesday, Nasheed's party, the Maldivian Democratic Party, said the former president was beaten by police. Four members of Parliament were detained as violence gripped the nation's capital, Male, lawmaker Eva Abdulla said, and the head of the party was hospitalized in critical condition. Is it safe to travel there? The British government issued a warning against non-essential travel to the island's capital, Male, while noting there have been no reports of strike at the Male International Airport or at resorts. Australia and the United States have also issued travel advisories. New President Waheed tried to assure citizens -- and tourists -- that the nation is safe and open for business. In a statement, he said differences among political parties and the public must be set aside for the sake of national unity. ""The nation witnessed difficult times in the recent past, but today the Maldivian people have made a momentous decision,"" he said in a statement. ""Following that decision...at any cost, the rule of law must be upheld."" On Wednesday, police sprayed tear gas and beat demonstrators with batons in Male, Abdulla said, and the violence left some protesters bleeding in the streets. ""It's absolute lack of order at the moment,"" she said. ""Nobody seems to be in charge."" A top U.N. official, Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, arrived in the islands Thursday for talks with government leaders and political parties. He said the world body wants to preserve ""the democratic gains that have been made in the Maldives,"" according to a statement from his office.

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's vice president arrived in Cuba early Saturday to visit President Hugo Chavez, who is recovering from a recent cancer surgery, a Cuban state newspaper reported. Vice President Nicolas Maduro arrived with Attorney General Cilia Flores at the Jose Marti International Airport in Havana, according to the newspaper, Granma International. A week ago, the vice president told state-run Venezuelan Television that Chavez's recovery ""is progressing with each day that passes."" The Venezuelan president first announced he was battling cancer in June 2011. He has not disclosed what type of cancer he has, and the Venezuelan government has released few details about his illness. The lack of information has fueled widespread speculation about his health and political future. Last year, Chavez had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor, and has undergone further surgery and radiation in Cuba since. He declared himself cancer-free in July. Health rumors dogged Chavez on the campaign trail this year, but didn't stop him from winning re-election in October. Chavez returned to Cuba this month to undergo another surgery after publicly revealing his cancer had returned. He underwent a six-hour surgical procedure on December 11 that Maduro declared a success in a televised address. Last week, the country's information minster said Chavez was battling a respiratory infection. Minister Ernesto Villegas said then that the infection was controlled. Last week, Villegas and another top government official struck a somber tone when discussing the president's illness. Villegas has suggested Chavez might not be not be back in Venezuela in time for his inauguration scheduled for next month.","Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro visits Hugo Chavez, state-run media reports .

Government forces are battling the M23 rebel group in the eastern part of that country.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. Opinion: How Obama can end Congo conflict . The agreement calls for cooperation among nations to ""preserve and protect the territorial sovereignty"" of the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said. Ban praised the framework but stressed that it marks just the beginning of a ""comprehensive approach that will require sustained engagement."" The deal was signed in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa by envoys of several African nations, including Uganda and Rwanda. Representatives from the rebel group were not involved. Ban said that a U.N. special envoy would be appointed to support the deal's implementation. South African President Jacob Zuma said the agreement represents an opportunity. Opinion: Hope for an end to world's deadliest war . ""This framework in itself does not provide all the answers, it is an instrument that points the Government of the DRC, its immediate neighbors and the international community in a direction that will take this country out of the current morass,"" Zuma said at the signing ceremony. The possible deployment of an intervention brigade of U.N. troops has been mentioned as a way of stabilizing the nation's restive eastern region. The agreement had been expected to be signed last month, but was delayed because of what Ban described as ""procedural issues."" The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions. Fighting between the M23 and the army has displaced close to a million people in North Kivu province and more than 300,000 in the southeastern province of Katanga, according to the United Nations. The unrest continues a cycle of misery in eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country.

"Canton, Georgia (CNN) -- The suspect in the slaying of a 7-year-old Georgia girl worked in the apartment complex where she lived, investigators said Wednesday. Authorities arrested maintenance worker Ryan Brunn, 20, Wednesday afternoon. He is charged with killing 7-year-old Jorelys Rivera, who was last seen alive Friday near a playground at the apartment complex in Canton. Investigators found her body in a trash compactor there three days later. Tips from the public led investigators to Brunn, who had been working at the complex since November 7, authorities said. ""We believe that this horrendous crime was planned and calculated,"" Vernon Keenan, the director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, told reporters. One resident said she told investigators about a recent conversation she had with Brunn, who mentioned that someone could break into one of the many vacant apartments in the complex and harm a child. Jorelys was abducted ""in the immediate vicinity"" of the apartment complex's playground, then taken to an empty apartment nearby, Keenan said. ""We have evidence that the murder occurred in that vacant apartment,"" he said. ""At some point, the child's body was then disposed of in the Dumpster and compacted into trash."" Authorities have said Jorelys died of blunt force trauma to the head, was stabbed and had been sexually assaulted. Earlier, Keenan said investigators had found blood in an empty apartment. Brunn's adopted brother told CNN affiliate WXIA that the arrest was a ""big mistake,"" and said investigators should have focused on the complex's other maintenance workers. ""I honestly think he is innocent. There's just no way he would do something like this. He's just a kindhearted person,"" Connor Brunn told WXIA. He said he'd spoken with his brother since the killing. ""He just told me he wouldn't touch a girl like that, he wouldn't ever do something like that. ... This is just all bogus. ... He knew that he was suspected but he never, like, thought that it would go to him. He was asked to help to go look for this little girl. And then he got brought into this,"" Connor Brunn said. Neighbor Heather Johnson-Coker said residents were suspicious of Ryan Brunn after investigators found Jorelys' body in the trash compactor, which can only be operated with a key that employees at the complex have. She said the maintenance worker had mentioned the large number of vacant apartments in the complex when a boy from the area went missing for a few hours recently. ""He said, and I quote, 'It would be really easy for someone to break in and do something to one of these children,'"" Johnson-Coker told HLN Wednesday. ""I did talk to him on a daily basis and he seemed like a relatively nice guy. He wasn't socially awkward. He didn't seem to have any type of anger issue. He seemed like a regular, decent person who worked there to make a living just like anybody else,"" she said. ""The statement at the time did not shock me. I did not think anything odd about it."" But Johnson-Corker said she told investigators about the conversation after investigators found Jorelys' body. Days earlier, the maintenance worker was in a search party with her husband after Jorelys went missing. ""They were together searching not five feet from each other, and it just turns my stomach thinking about it,"" she said. After Ryan Brunn's arrest Wednesday, mother Joselin Rivera wept next to a family memorial for her daughter, and said she didn't know if she would recognize the suspect. ""I can't tell you who he is. ... I don't want any charges brought against him. What I want is the death penalty. He's an animal. He killed my little angel,"" Joselin Rivera told CNN affiliate WSB. She wore a T-shirt with Jorelys' picture that said, ""We will always remember you."" Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told CNN the 7-year-old's slaying was one of the most brutal crimes his agency has ever seen. Ryan Brunn was one of hundreds of people investigators interviewed in their search for suspects, Keenan said Wednesday. ""We're confident that Brunn is a killer,"" Keenan said, but he added that the investigation will continue for months. ""We are investigating all of the past history of Ryan Brunn and piecing together what he's been doing the last several years,"" Keenan said. ""We have sent agents to other states and also to other counties and we're going to backtrack all of his activities and make a determination if he has been involved in other crimes. He has no known criminal history to us, but we will find out."" Posts on a Facebook page that friends said belonged to Brunn recently talked of plans to move to Canton. ""New job,apt,life coming soon,"" an October 6 post said. A post on November 5 said, ""Today is moving day! Not ready to go but i got to."" The brutal killing has shaken residents of the apartment complex, located about 40 miles north of Atlanta. Residents shouted words like ""monster"" and ""scum bucket"" at Ryan Brunn as authorities arrested him Wednesday, neighbor Kelly Knight told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell."" ""It was very surreal. As soon as we heard they were coming in to that apartment, I went outside my door and I witnessed it all. And I even hollered at him that I'd like to shoot him myself,"" Knight said. Ryan Brunn is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday at 1:30 p.m. at the Cherokee County Courthouse in Canton, Keenan said. CNN's Gustavo Valdes, Holly Firfer, Mike Brooks and Rich Phillips contributed to this report from Canton, Georgia. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta.","NEW: The suspect's brother tells WXIA that his arrest is a ""big mistake""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama called on Tuesday for a short-term agreement to put off deep cuts to government spending, including the military, set to take effect next month. Obama made his pitch in a statement to reporters at the White House, urging Congress to pass a measure that would offset some of the imminent automatic spending cuts -- known as sequestration -- that were part of a 2011 debt ceiling deal. The president made clear that he still wanted a broader deficit reduction agreement with Republicans that included spending cuts, entitlement reforms and increased revenue from eliminating some tax breaks. However, Obama said, with time running out before the sequestration cuts slash government spending and result in job losses and economic slowdown, Congress should pass a temporary fix that will allow time for further negotiations on a broader plan. ""Our economy right now is headed in the right direction and it will stay that way as long as there aren't any more self-inflicted wounds coming out of Washington,"" he said. ""So let's keep on chipping away at this problem together, as Democrats and Republicans, to give our workers and our businesses the support that they need to thrive in the weeks and months ahead,"" he added. Before Obama spoke, House Republican leaders slammed him for failing to produce a budget proposal the day before, which they said is a long-standing deadline to do so under federal law. We care: Cantor wants to give GOP a 'makeover,' change the message . In the 2011 debt ceiling deal that ended a showdown over whether to increase the federal government's borrowing limit to meet its obligations, Congress and the White House agreed to include the automatic spending cuts of sequestration as motivation to pass a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan. Deep partisan divisions prevented such an agreement from happening in 2012, an election year, leading to the impending sequestration cuts this year. The government has already delayed the impact of sequestration for the first two months of 2013. On Tuesday, Obama said he still supported a broader deal and made clear that revenue from tax reform measures previously agreed to by Republicans -- such as eliminating some loopholes to increase revenue for the government -- should be part of it. However, he noted that it was unlikely Congress would reach a deficit-reduction deal by March 1 to render the sequestration cuts moot. ""If they can't get a bigger package done by the time the sequester is scheduled to go into effect, then I believe that they should at least pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms that would delay the economically damaging effects of the sequester for a few more months until Congress finds a way to replace these cuts with a smarter solution,"" Obama said. 'Without questions': Reid says more revenue needed to fix budget problems . Earlier, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, reacted to news of Obama's plan by saying it was the president who ""first proposed the sequester and insisted it become law."" Reiterating the longstanding position of Republicans in budget negotiations, Boehner called for replacing the sequester plan with spending cuts and what he called reforms -- a reference to changes in popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A last-second agreement in the previous Congress that passed in the first days of 2013 raised tax rates on top income earners as part of a limited deficit-reduction package. That measure followed weeks of tough negotiations involving Obama and Congress in which other steps to increase government revenue, such as eliminating some tax breaks for corporations, were considered but not included in the final deal. Obama and Democrats now want such revenue-raising steps to be part of a package that would replace the mandated deficit reduction of the sequester cuts. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky expressed his opposition to such a move Tuesday, saying ""the American people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the president signed into law."" Federal spending cuts under sequestration total more than $1 trillion over 10 years, half of which would come from the Pentagon. It's your fault: How our 'tribes' help create gridlock in Congress . Military officials have warned that those cuts, on top of steep budget reductions already in the pipeline over the next decade, would be devastating to its operations as well as the civilian economy that depends on defense-related jobs and spending. Obama's push to avoid the sequester cuts comes a week before he outlines his second-term agenda in the State of the Union address. Congress, which authorizes federal spending, has failed to pass detailed annual budgets in recent years due to partisan gridlock over spending and debt, as well as electoral politics. Instead, it has approved a series of extensions of past spending authorizations -- called continuing resolutions -- to keep the government funded. During his first term, Obama's annual budget proposals prompted immediate opposition from Republicans -- and Democrats at times -- that rendered ineffective the early year exercise of outlining his spending priorities. The plan for temporarily extending the sequester deadline follows a similar move by congressional Republicans last month on raising the nation's debt ceiling. That deal put off further wrangling on the federal borrowing limit until mid-May. Some analysts warn that Washington's fiscal paralysis harms the nation's fragile economy and could bring another recession. Short-term approaches like the recent debt-ceiling measure and now Obama's push on the sequester cuts allows more time for negotiations on a possible broader deal that would address all issues at once.","NEW: Avoid ""self-inflicted wounds"" out of Washington, President Obama says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The showdown over who will bear the brunt of deep cuts to government spending has become a game of political poker with the nation's troops caught in the middle, political experts and members of the military say. As he prepares to leave office, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta sounded a dire warning about the need to limit military pay to a 1% increase in 2014, effectively decreasing troop salaries next year, if the automatic cuts, called sequester, go into effect, an agency official told CNN. First on CNN: Panetta to recommend pay cut for military . ""This shadow, the shadow of sequestration, this legislative madness that was designed to be so bad, so bad, that no one in their right mind would let it happen,"" Panetta said in a speech at Georgetown University on Wednesday. ""For those of you who have ever seen (the movie) 'Blazing Saddles,' it is the scene of the sheriff putting the gun to his head in order to establish law and order. That is sequestration."" Panetta warns of degraded military readiness from spending cuts . The Pentagon has calculated that the Labor Department's 2014 Employment Cost Index is expected to be above 1%, but wants to still reduce pay because of ""budget uncertainties,"" a government official told CNN. In 2013, a 1.7% increase was approved, based on the index, which has been the basis for military pay for the past several years. Panetta is stepping up rhetoric about the impact of sequestration on the Pentagon if Congress does not agree to a plan in coming weeks to avert it. Sequestration would cut across the government, but would hit the Pentagon especially hard. The military would face roughly $500 million in spending cuts over 10 years on top of a similar amount already in the pipeline. President Barack Obama previously walled off the military from a reduction in pay so if this current compensation plan goes into effect, it's widely seen as ""cutting our pay,"" one military officer familiar with the plan told CNN. ""It's a smart move, it puts it in Congress' hands."" CNN Explains: Sequestration . Panetta's comments followed Obama's call on Tuesday for a short-term agreement to avert sequestration, which was created by Congress in 2011 to be so draconian that lawmakers would strike a budget deal and avoid the cuts. But now, the deadline for action is coming up next month and there's no deal in sight. Obama calls for short-term fix to imminent spending cuts . Top Republicans on the House and Senate Armed Services committees released their own approach for temporarily staving off the brunt of those cuts by cutting some federal jobs through attrition. ""America's military has absorbed $487 billion in defense cuts under President Obama, with $500 billion yet to come with sequestration. Refusing to consider reforms to the mandatory spending that is driving our debt crisis, while using our troops as a piggy bank to keep unsustainable spending programs on life support, will have both fiscal and strategic consequences,"" Rep. Howard P. ""Buck"" McKeon, R-Calif., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote in a statement. All of this amounts to some pretty high stakes poker, political experts say. ""Scare talk about the effects of spending cuts is common in these circumstances. Mostly, it's a parade of imaginary horribles. Although this time, the magnitude of the cuts, especially in defense, gives greater force to the dire predictions,"" said Ross Baker, a Rutgers political science professor. Still, the specter of potential cuts worries those on the front lines and their families. ""I feel like when things get tough and the economy goes and they look at cuts they immediately take benefits or pay or housing allowances,"" said Vicky Cody, author of ""Your Soldier, Your Army: A Parent's Guide"", the wife of retired Army Gen. Richard Cody and the mother of two members of the military. ""These are the kids who are deploying. Regardless of how people who feel about the war, this is a group of people who need to be compensated for what they do not taken away from,"" she said. Commenters on the story on CNN.com who identified themselves as members of the military were similarly frustrated. ""I am disgusted by this,"" wrote one commenter who identified as AFMEDIC. ""I am in the US military and currently deployed. I get to see and hear what happens to the rest of my military brothers and sisters putting their lives on the line for a country. It is an ugly reality. And what are they getting blown up for? Why do we spend days, months, and even years away from our families for? For a country whose leaders don't believe we are worthy enough to get a decent raise to take care of the families that have to deal with the consequences of our jobs. We are cutting budget everywhere else, why can't they cut their own salary? Where are the priorities of these people??"" A commenter who identified himself as Philip wrote that lots of Americans aren't getting pay raises in the current economy. ""A 1% pay raise is more of a raise than many Americans have received the last few years combined. Welcome to the new economy!"" he wrote. ""And don't give me this 'hero' BS, as many in the military only joined because they couldn't find jobs here. In the military they preach of being part of a team, well enjoy teaming with the civilians who also face hardships in getting paid."" Hyperbole is all part of an effort to get the other side to blink first, Baker said. ""The number of workers likely to be laid off as a result of the sequester is basically imaginary although there will almost certainly be a slight surge in unemployment,"" Baker said. ""I really don't think that the Pentagon will cut troop salaries which would hinder recruitment and retention. It's much more likely that weapons systems will take the hit."" It's not the first time both the administration and congressional Republicans have tried to call each other's bluff over the spending cuts. Last year, President Obama told thousands of veterans at the National Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars '""Stop playing politics with our military.'""

"(Rolling Stone) -- You probably could've guessed it was a Beach Boys show just by the shirts the men in the audience wore: Collared, short-sleeved and oversized, with palm trees, hibiscus flowers and nautical gear printed all over them. At the back of the stage, surfboards were lined up like Grecian columns on either side of a huge video screen. It wasn't until midway through the band's second set that Mike Love acknowledged what half the people in the audience must've been thinking: ""It's, uh, been a little while since we've all been on tour together."" This year, the Beach Boys turn 50. Until the Grammys this past February, Brian Wilson, the band's troubled heart, hadn't been on stage with the rest of them since 1996. The tour kickoff last night at the Anselmo Valencia Amphitheater in Tucson was, in that sense, a milestone: not only a marker of their anniversary, but of a public reconciliation between Wilson and the band's other surviving original members: Al Jardine, Bruce Johnson, David Marks and Wilson's cousin, Mike Love. It's not until a band like the Beach Boys runs through their hits back-to-back in rapid succession that you realize just how many hits they've had. Over the course of nearly two and a half hours, they played an astonishing 42 songs, many of them medley-style, with nearly no banter in between. Amid the most familiar stuff -- ""California Girls,"" ""Surfin' Safari,"" ""Good Vibrations"" -- were a healthy number of deep cuts and covers, including ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"" and Phil Spector's ""Then He Kissed Me,"" which Jardine probably wisely rephrased as ""Then I Kissed Her."" There were also two uncanny video appearances by Carl and Dennis Wilson, both of whom died years ago. (Dennis ""sang"" ""Forever,"" while Carl took on ""God Only Knows,"" a song Brian wrote for him on 1966's Pet Sounds.) And about halfway through the second set, something new showed up: A reflective midtempo ballad called ""That's Why God Made the Radio"" -- a moment that, like so much of the band's best music, elevated the adolescent to the divine. Onstage, Mike Love was a low-key kind of showboat, stepping back and forth with the beat, miming the revving of a motorcycle engine on ""Little Honda"" and hugging his elbows when he sang ""and the northern girls with the way they kiss, they keep their boyfriends warm at night"" on ""California Girls."" Brian seemed placid and stone-faced, sitting at the bench of a large white grand piano. ""Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Wilson,"" Al Jardine said after ""This Whole World,"" at which point the crowd rose to their feet in reverence as he sat, blinking. In a sense, Love and Wilson have always been spiritual opposites: Brian wanted to escape to the solace of his bed on ""In My Room""; Mike wanted to escape to the solace of tropical beaches on ""Kokomo."" They are as strange a pair as they've ever been, but it's their balance -- between Brian's quiet yearning and Mike's inability to have anything short of a good time -- that creates the band's strange chemistry. And while this was in some ways a show about Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys are a highly professional enterprise that depend on highly professional people. At any given time there were between six and fifteen hands on stage, including multitaskers on various saxophones and someone to pick up the French horn on ""God Only Knows,"" the harmonica on ""Heroes and Villains"" and the theremin for ""Good Vibrations."" Oh, and do that singing thing they do, too. Considering it was the first night of a semi-momentous reunion tour, there wasn't a whole lot of sentimentality going back and forth, which isn't to say the band didn't care about each other, only that they probably cared about the audience more. There were moments, though, between the childhood photographs of the band flashing on the big screen and the brief congratulations they gave each other between songs, that the weight of their history together was felt. At the end of ""When I Grow Up (To Be a Man),"" Al Jardine looked at the floor, shook his head and laughed. In the 50 years between then and now, they'd grown up. Throughout the night, a security guard patiently collected beach balls that had traveled through the crowd, stockpiling them behind a large speaker at stage right. By the end of the second set, the pile had reached halfway up the speakers to the jumbo screen, where Brian's white grand piano lingered on the screen for a second, then disappeared. During the encore he batted them back into the crowd, one by one. Setlist .

"(CNN) -- Money talks -- that's hardly a revelation, but the overriding feeling towards Saturday's David Haye versus Dereck Chisora ""circus fight"" in London is shock and outrage that it could even take place. With neither fighter holding a British boxing license, promoter Frank Warren had to resort to asking the little-known Luxembourg federation to sanction the bout. It has since been expelled from the European Boxing Union for agreeing to give legitimacy to an event that no-one else would touch. Chisora was banned by the World Boxing Council and the British Boxing Board of Control following his bust-up with Haye in Munich in February, while his former world champion opponent escaped punishment only because he had already retired. Their ugly scuffle at a press conference after Chisora's defeat by Vitali Klitschko, which Haye attended, has set the scene for a showdown straight from the pages of the professional wrestling handbook. Their pantomime behavior has only served to rack up the ticket sales to close to 30,000 and secure airtime in 60 countries worldwide. Chisora threatens to shoot Haye . ""Chisora's not a nice guy, the fact he bites people in the ring, spits water in peoples' faces, slaps people at weigh-ins, kisses people at weigh-ins. What's to like?"" Haye said this week. Boxing commentator Steve Bunce has compared Haye and Chisora's Munich brawl to Lennox Lewis' pre-fight rumble with Mike Tyson a decade ago. Lewis punched Tyson, and in exchange the American bit his leg. This was heralded at the time as the biggest fight ever. Needless to say this won't be the biggest fight ever, but expect passion, expect a feisty encounter between two British heavyweights who have both gone the distance with the Klitschko brothers in the past year and are still holding out for a rematch. Haye has pointed to worldwide attraction to the scuffle in Germany -- 20 million views of a YouTube video showing him brandishing a glass bottle -- as justification for Saturday's fight. Can boxing climb out of the gutter? ""People are looking at it. If I'm disappointed in something, I'm not going to keep looking at it,"" Haye, who lost his WBA title to Wladimir Klitschko last year, told the UK Press Association. ""Beating Chisora won't add to my legacy. In 50 years' time when people look back at my career they won't see this fight and think Dereck Chisora was a great fight and look what David did to him. ""Chisora doesn't have any titles and has been coming off three losses. It's a fight for the night, simply because I beat him up at a press conference a few months ago."" To give some indication of where men's boxing is at, on the same night Britain's Amir Khan will be fighting Danny Garcia in Las Vegas, having been reinstated as WBA welterweight champion after American Lamont Peterson was found guilty of doping following his controversial win when they met in December. WBC champion Garcia's trainer and father has already upped the stakes by insulting Khan's Pakistani heritage. ""He's going to see a Pakistani fight on Saturday and knock his son out,"" Khan responded. It's all in stark contrast to the image that women's boxing will be hoping to portray in the UK capital in the coming weeks, as females get to fight at the Olympics for the first time. There's still some divided opinion as to whether female boxers should be included at the Games, but anyone who watches the athleticism and speed of veteran world titleholders Katie Taylor and Mary Kom will be left in no doubt as to their value to the tournament. ""She is without doubt the finest female amateur boxer in the world,"" Bunce said of Taylor, who has won her 60 kg division at every world championships since 2006. According to one blogger: ""Katie Taylor has single-handedly made women's boxing an accepted, if not yet a mainstream sport. Young girls throughout Ireland lace up in clubs each week, inspired by a bona fide hero, and our collective print and broadcast media are enamored with the woman that inspired them."" The Irish fighter's father Peter agrees, telling the Gulf news website: ""Katie's pioneered the way for female boxing, she's made their path a little bit easier."" Going to the Games, or watching from home? Send us your pictures and videos . He's referring to the likes of 17-year-old Claressa Shields, who was the youngest boxer at the U.S. Olympic trials in February and fights with an assuredness beyond her years. Then there's Savannah Marshall, who won Britain's first world title on her 21st birthday in May. ""She's winning for fun,"" says Bunce. Kom, a five-time world champion and mother of twins, has been rated as one of the world's most marketable athletes by SportsPro magazine. ""She has the potential to turn her into an Indian sporting legend and a role model for young Indian women,"" it said. ""Despite its huge population, Olympic golds have been thin on the ground for India but Kom, the daughter of a farmer, has had the kind of humble beginnings and a family-oriented appeal that could make her the archetypal national heroine."" The name of boxing may have taken quite a battering in recent weeks with the media circus surrounding Haye vs. Chisora, but the women are sure to knock the men out of the limelight when it really matters at the London Games. Just don't expect the (possibly fake) blood and guts you might see this weekend. ""Amateur female boxing is more about technique and skill and evading the heavy blows than it is about smashing people up,"" says Tanya Aldred in British newspaper The Independent. ""For that reason, it should appeal to those who admire the discipline of boxing but not the blood and gore.""","David Haye and Dereck Chisora will face off this Saturday in London .

"(CNN) -- Many have criticized the body mass index, or BMI, as being a poor indicator of obesity and of obesity-related health risks. Critics say BMI is too simple to be accurate, that it doesn't take into account a person's muscle mass or where the body fat is located. Americans, therefore, may be tempted to brush off the easy-to-access statistic -- and the possible need for lifestyle changes -- if they don't like their results. Alternative methods such as waist-to-height ratios or body composition testing may be more accurate in measuring an individual's body fat percentage. But BMI is just as good at providing information about your health risks and can be easily, reliably and cheaply used by clinicians and patients to provide a useful snapshot of how someone's weight compares to healthy standards. Your BMI can be calculated online with a simple formula: weight in kilograms divided by height in centimeters squared. In pounds and inches this formula becomes weight in pounds divided by height in inches squared, multiplied by 703 to account for the metric conversion. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 indicates a normal weight; a BMI between 25 and 29.9 indicates a person is overweight; and a BMI of 30 or above indicates obesity. There are always exceptions to any rule, but when it comes to predicting obesity-related health risks, BMI is among the strongest predictors, regardless of what critics say. Memphis, most obese U.S. city, moving from fat to fit . Even when compared with other measures such as waist circumference, waist-to-height-ratio, percent body fat, fat mass index or fat-free mass index, the science shows that BMI is just as good at predicting obesity-related health risks. My research team at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health examined cross-sectional measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, percent body fat, blood pressure measurements, cholesterol levels and fasting glucose levels for more than 12,000 adults using information from EHE International's database of patients. The numbers showed that BMI is the strongest predictor of blood pressure, and the measurement is comparable to other measurements at predicting cholesterol levels. BMI also performed admirably against other measures in predicting fasting glucose levels, which are an important part of diagnosing diabetes. It's tempting to write off BMI as overly simplistic when it delivers news about our weight and health that we don't like. But the bottom line is that it's time to start using this easy-to-access measure and heed its warnings about your health. If your BMI is high, chances are good it's because you have excess fat tissue, which means you're at risk for other health problems, including heart disease related to high blood pressure or high cholesterol, and diabetes. Instead of blindly rejecting BMI, more patients and doctors should be embracing it as a screening tool. Individuals who know they have a high BMI should talk to their doctor about what they can do to get their weight into a healthy range. Doctors should be confident in making lifestyle change recommendations based on an initial BMI measurement. By accepting reality, focusing on preventive care and heeding the warning signs of a dangerous weight, patients and doctors can work together to build healthy lifestyles, instead of treating the results of unhealthy ones. Obesity rate may be worse than we think .","Doctor: Body mass index is useful snapshot of how weight compares to healthy standards .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week condemned China's ""unnecessary escalation"" of tensions between the two nations over disputed islets known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. He was referring to two incidents in January when Chinese frigates reportedly locked weapons radar onto a Japanese vessel and a helicopter, a claim China denies. Once fire-control radar is locked on, a missile can be fired at the designated target, generating obvious risks of miscalculation. At best this is a militarized game of tag but one that could, at its worst, spark wider hostilities. When Japan indicated that its jets might fire tracer bullets to warn off Chinese aircraft, a Chinese general responded that Japan should refrain from doing so, as this would be taken as an act of war. In this context, there is good reason to be concerned that Asia is sleepwalking its way towards war. On February 6, Abe told the country's parliament, known as the Diet, ""The incident is dangerous conduct that could have led to an unforeseeable situation. It is extremely regrettable that China carried out such a one-sided, provocative act when signs are emerging for dialogue."" He added, ""I ask the Chinese side to return to the spirit of mutually beneficial, strategic relations and prevent the recurrence of an incident like this. I strongly ask them for restraint so that the situation will not escalate further."" The probing has escalated in 2013 as both sides have scrambled jets and patrol boats shadow each other. Given the perilous state of bilateral relations, and recent efforts at fence-mending, why the radar-rattling? And why did Abe only go public with his concern a week after the latest incident? The Chinese Foreign Ministry initially seemed curiously unprepared for Abe's allegations, deflecting questions and suggesting reporters ask the relevant agencies involved. But the spokeswomen did say that Japan should stop conducting ""illegal activities,"" meaning the deployment of Japanese ships and jet aircraft in the disputed seas and airspace around the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands. China's Global Times pugnaciously dismissed Abe's allegations as a ""self-directed and self-acted farce,"" staged in preparation for his visit to Washington later this month. Abe is known to seek closer security cooperation with the U.S. and has stated that he intends to revise the Constitution to ease constraints on the Japanese military. It is not clear how Abe could exploit the incident to sway the Obama administration since it doesn't reveal anything about China that Washington doesn't already know and worry about. The radar incident may indeed play into Abe's hands, reminding Japanese that they live in a dangerous neighborhood. But given North Korea's missile and nuclear testing program, it's safe to say they already know that. The Japanese media reaction has been predictably outraged, but the Mainichi did point out that China's actions signal frustration with the Japanese government's intransigent position of denying that there even is a territorial dispute. Japan knows from experience how frustrating this can be as Russia also maintains there is no territorial dispute regarding what Japan calls the Northern Territories, near Hokkaido. When former premier Yukio Hatoyama recently visited China, he caused a stir at home when he acknowledged that there is a territorial dispute, prompting the defense minister to call him a traitor. So is this merely a case of Abe hyping the dangers poised by China to advance his agenda of constitutional revision? Or is China upping the ante in a calculated risk? Probably a bit of both. Revising Japan's peace constitution is controversial with voters and Abe is eager to gain control of the Upper House of the Diet in summer elections. Since Abe has a lock on security issues, focusing on the China threat has its uses. Equally, Beijing is keen to remind Tokyo that this problem will not go away and that it will continue to press its claim to sovereignty and is willing to take disproportionate risks to pressure Japan into at last acknowledging there is a dispute. In January, a succession of prominent Japanese politicians visited China, signaling a thaw in relations. Natsuo Yamaguchi, head of New Komeito, Abe's ruling coalition partner, delivered a letter from Abe to Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping. Xi responded quite positively to Abe's call for improving relations and a summit. His comments led to a brief toning down of fiery rhetoric in China. The incidents also follow China's efforts to involve the United Nations in the dispute to determine the validity of its claim that the islands are a natural extension of its continental shelf. The radar-rattling also raises questions about who gave the orders or whether the frigate captains were acting at their own discretion. Monolithic images notwithstanding, this incident underscores the reality that there are various state actors in China with varying agendas. The problem is that the island dispute has become highly politicized in China and the genie of nationalism limits room for maneuver. Emotions run high and in such a context the current dead-end policy is the path of least resistance. Is Asia heading toward war just as Europe did a century ago? There are also parallels with Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations 80 years ago in February 1933 over censure of its occupation of Manchuria and subsequent aggression throughout Asia until its defeat in 1945. China suffered more than any other country from this rampage. Like China today, Japan felt that the international status quo was biased and denying what it deemed its legitimate aspirations. It decided to modify that status quo by force of arms. History doesn't repeat itself, but Mark Twain reminds us that it sometimes rhymes. In 1913 and 1933, there was a rational expectation that cooler heads would prevail and governments would come to their senses. Asia in 2013 may not be sliding towards war and China and Japan understand how mutually beneficial relations have been, and how much they risk losing, but we also know the folly of assuming risk away. Leadership transitions generate risk because new leaders need to project strength, a need that complicates the compromises necessary to lower bilateral tensions. The zigzagging of diplomacy and confrontation on display highlights that re-shelving the sovereignty issue and managing this dispute won't be easy. The increased diplomatic activity is a good sign, and should urgently focus on hammering out a code of conduct in the disputed seas and airspace that can help prevent armed miscalculations. Both nations have already agreed to establish an emergency hotline and it's now time to get that connected. Let's hope that the various lessons of 1913 and 1933 are absorbed by all the relevant parties, including Washington, and Asia's two leading nations wake up before a nightmare descends. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Kingston.","China-Japan tensions escalated after incident between respective navies .

"(CNN) -- If you read the headlines this week about the the death of Judge Robert Bork, you probably took away that he will be remembered for his conservative judicial philosophy and losing a very contentious Supreme Court confirmation battle. You probably didn't read about the impact he made on modern media, and maybe even on the debate the Internet had about Instagram this week. But that's part of his legacy, too. Let's connect the dots from Bork to Instagram, shall we? 1. The Bork Tapes . President Ronald Reagan nominated Bork for the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987. During his confirmation hearings, an enterprising reporter found a list of the movies he'd rented at his local video rental store. You might imagine the reporter was looking for something among the rentals that could shed new light on the man. What turned up was a pretty ho-hum list of movies including lots and lots of Cary Grant and at least one middling Danny DeVito comedy. (The reporter's own back story on what he was looking for in procuring that rental list is slightly more nuanced -- it's a good read, which you can find here.) 2. The VPPA . Perhaps the biggest controversy about Bork's rental list was how deadly dull it was. But, who knows? Maybe some of those lawmakers had something to hide? Within a few short months of the hearings, the U.S. Congress passed the Video Privacy Protection Act -- VPPA for short -- a law that was written to keep video rental records private, but which still governs parts of our digital-media world. 3. Class action catnip . The crux of the law, and of the lawsuits that followed, is something called a ""private right of action"" and a tidy penalty for violating it. The VPPA allows individuals whose viewing history was shared to sue for $2,500 a pop. That's litigation catnip for class-action attorneys, who make a living collecting large groups of allegedly wronged people with something to gain from saying so. It was a clever way for lawmakers to ensure that people would abide by the law. (Now you really want to see those Congress-folks' lists, right?) 4. Goodbye, Beacon . The VPPA was the law that was used to shut down Facebook's controversial ""Beacon"" program in 2009. Beacon was a feature that powered messages in your news feed about your activities on other websites, a la ""Sean just bought a diamond ring on Overstock.com!"" Too bad it was an engagement ring, and Facebook spoiled the secret. Facebook relented after a class-action lawsuit involving exactly that kind of story -- a Facebook-foiled marriage proposal. The site first provided a way to opt out and eventually shut Beacon down altogether and coughed up a $9.5 million settlement. Beacon became a target because among the activities being shared was video viewing (in addition to diamond buying and lots of other things). More recent VPPA suits involve Netflix, Best Buy and Redbox. 5. Enter Netflix . Since then, as social networks have exploded in popularity and social media sharing has become de rigueur, just about any of us could flip open Facebook and see a stream of all the music our friends are listening to right this second. But because of the VPPA, you couldn't see the same thing for the movies they're watching. Companies like Netflix have been pushing hard to change that. Telling your friends what you're up to is, after all, the modern equivalent of word-of-mouth advertising. Netflix says its users want to be able to share which movies they're watching online with their friends, and has lobbied Congress to amend the law. This week, the U.S. House of Representatives approved an amendment to the VPPA that would allow individuals to opt in to sharing their online viewing habits. The Senate recently passed something similar, and all signs point to a change in the weeks ahead. OK -- bear with me here. We're almost to Instagram. 6. Looooong privacy policies . The amendment the House passed says explicitly that it is, indeed, possible to give your consent to share information about your video viewing via the Internet. Great. What it doesn't necessarily make clear, though, is exactly how to do that, and how a company that is sharing your information can make certain that you understand what you are agreeing to. What that means in practical terms is that most terms of use for social and digital media services are very long and exhaustive. It's in companies' best interest to tell you everything they possibly can about what you're consenting to, so they can't be penalized the way Facebook was in the Beacon debacle. 7. The Instagram revolt . Which is where Instagram comes in. The company announced Monday that it would be updating its terms of service to include new ways it could share and treat your personal information and content. Immediately, people began speculating about why Instagram might need these new disclosures, and what on earth it could be planning. Was it going to sell photos of your kids to advertisers, without even telling you about it? Yikes. Founder Kevin Systrom responded to the frenzy by saying, ""We've heard loud and clear that many users are confused and upset about what the changes mean,"" and then tried to get more clear about what the legal documents mean. The language that most concerned users (apparently granting permission to sell images without notifying or paying the user) would be removed, he said. BONUS: What now? OK, so what does this mean for us? It looks as though the law may change, and soon enough you may be able to click a button and tell your friends what you're watching on Netflix. But it also means that terms and privacy policies for digital services may get longer and even more complicated as a result. So read those terms, folks. Especially if you think you might get tapped for the Supreme Court.","Judge Robert Bork, who died this week, has unlikely connection to digital media .

"(CNN) -- As rockets fly in Gaza and Israel, a shareable and ready-to-retweet version of the violence is playing out online. Official military accounts for the Israel Defense Forces and the military wing of Hamas have been posting slick-looking, social-media-friendly graphics in an effort to sway public opinion. Here's one example from Israel, retweeted some 2,600 times: . And another from Hamas, retweeted more than 350 times: . Notice that both sides want Internet users to ""share this"" or ""share now."" That's a new concept for militaries that are engaged in active conflict, writes Matt Buchanan for BuzzFeed. ""Unlike any propaganda machine before it, it's inherently viral. It's designed to spread,"" he wrote. The IDF's tweets ""are a mixture of documentation, saber rattling, sober reminders of the reality of war, and upbeat updates on the advanced state of its technology. All delivered direct to you. Please RT."" But as both sides seek to distort the reality of a conflict that has killed three Israelis and more than two dozen Palestinians, they could have taken a lesson from social media history: Online marketing campaigns tend to backfire, at least in part. ""On one level, it makes sense for the military to use the internet to provide useful information and possibly even explain its mission to the public. (They have Spanish and French-language versions of the account too, for added global reach.),"" writes Dashiell Bennett for The Atlantic Wire. ""But the odd tone of the writing, has taken some people aback and left the IDF open to mockery and charges of insensitivity regarding a very sensitive subject."" The people of the Internet have started using the same tools as Israel and Hamas to mock the idea of a military broadcasting live information about itself on social platforms. ""IDF announced the war on Twitter, warned Gazans thru SMS & troops showed us action on Instagram."" wrote one Twitter user, @THE_47th. ""Israel is the Kim Kardashian of nations."" In response to Hamas' death toll image, one Twitter user wrote: ""so be *real* heroes for your people - stop firing back. Restraint is what requires real courage."" The jabs -- some humorous, some serious -- show how difficult it can be to control the conversation in an era of real-time media. Here's one of the more-discussed critiques of Israel's social media campaign, in which a writer for the site BuzzFeed created a fake tweet from the Israel Defense Forces: . That post, in which the author appears to mock use of social media, also raised questions about humor during a violent conflict, and the authenticity of information on social networks. ""Does a journalist faking a tweet from an official govt account cross a line?"" asked Alex Howard, a writer at O'Reilly Media. BuzzFeed's co-founder came to the defense of that tweet's author: . Some criticism takes a more serious tone. ""The Twitter/BuzzFeed friendly media strategy of IDF this time -- big infographics, tweets made to go viral etc -- scares the hell out of me,"" Tom Gara wrote on Twitter. And others fear the tit-for-tat could actually escalate the conflict. ""This is a new reality of war,"" Heather Hurlburt, from the National Security Network, told the Los Angeles Times. ""And I worry that it's going to make it harder to stand down."" There already have been some efforts to quantify who is winning the war on social media. Hamas wins when it comes to the use of its hashtag, writes a blogger for the Washington Post. Israel is winning the follower count battle, says BuzzFeed. But there are also, of course, voices in the middle. Andy Carvin, a senior strategist at NPR, has been aggregating and retweeting people in both Israel and Gaza. Those posts, and others from journalists on the ground tend to show a grittier reality of the violence in the Middle East: . Let us know what you think of the social media tactics in the comments.","Israel and Hamas release shareable images on social media .
In some ways, that's backfired, with the Internet mocking the posts ."
"(CNN) -- More than 1,000 miles away from the jungle where rebels allegedly kidnapped and killed his father, Antonio Caballero is seeking justice. He filed a lawsuit in a Florida court this month, 13 years after the bullet-riddled body of his father -- a former senator and U.N. ambassador -- was found on a dirt road in northern Colombia. In the civil complaint, Caballero -- who now lives in Florida after receiving political asylum in the United States -- says he was forced to flee his home country, abandoning property and businesses, and he wants those responsible to pay. The defendants are two guerrilla groups that have been at war with the Colombian government for decades: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). Caballero ""has suffered and continues to suffer emotional, psychological and economic damages"" since rebel forces kidnapped, tortured and killed his father, the lawsuit says. He alleges that their actions violated Florida racketeering statutes and U.S. federal laws, and that Colombian laws hold the rebel groups liable for wrongful death. He aims to get ""tens of millions of dollars"" in damages, the law firm representing him said in a statement. But the money is only part of the battle, attorney Joseph Zumpano said. ""There is a record that needs to be made. ... People should not forget the horrific acts of brutality,"" he said. ""They took a person who was one of the most prominent people in the nation and discarded his body on a dirt road."" Antonio Caballero's father, Carlos Caballero, was a former Colombian senator, political party leader and ambassador to the United Nations. He was 76 years old when he was taken hostage in February 1999, according to the complaint. The politician was found dead more than six months later, the complaint says, after rebels had demanded a ransom of $6 million for his release. During the 184 days that they held him hostage, rebel forces tortured him daily, forcing him to walk through the jungle for hours and depriving him of food and water, according to the complaint. Records from the Colombian government's human rights observatory also blame rebels for the death. According to the lawsuit, Carlos Caballero was targeted because of his political positions against the rebel groups and because property he owned could be used to facilitate drug production and transport. Although the killing occurred in Colombia, the lawsuit argues that U.S. federal laws -- including the Alien Tort Statute and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- give American courts jurisdiction in the case. The lawsuit was filed in Florida's Miami-Dade County Circuit Court because of the groups' alleged drug trafficking activities in the state, and because Antonio Caballero lives there now and returning to Colombia to file a claim ""would place his life in extreme peril,"" the complaint says. ""He's under an ongoing threat that forces him to work within our system,"" Zumpano said. There has been no comment on the case published on websites that the rebel groups typically use to release information. This isn't the first time Colombian rebels have been tied to lawsuits in the United States. Other lawsuits have been filed against the FARC in federal court, records show -- including a pending 2009 case seeking damages filed by three American contractors who were held hostage by the guerrilla group. That case seeks garnishment of millions of dollars in frozen assets from U.S. bank accounts connected to the FARC. The United States has designated both the FARC and the ELN as foreign terrorist organizations. ""These groups foster violence and instability...in an attempt to advance their political agendas, and largely finance their operations through the illicit drug trade,"" Rodney Benson, chief of intelligence for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said in congressional testimony last year. The U.S. National Couterterrorism Center describes the FARC as ""Latin America's oldest, largest, most capable, and best-equipped insurgency of Marxist origin"" and notes that it has ""well-documented ties to a range of drug trafficking activities"" Tactics include ""bombings, murder, mortar attacks, kidnapping, extortion, and hijacking, as well as guerrilla and conventional military action against Colombian political, military, and economic targets,"" the center says. Caballero's lawsuit comes amid renewed peace talks between the Colombian government and FARC rebels, who have been meeting in Havana, Cuba. Zumpano said Tuesday that the case's goal ""is not to interject itself in the negotiations,"" but he hopes the lawsuit will bring the group's tactics to light. ""Terrorism isn't just something in the Middle East,"" he said. ""It's alive and well in the Americas as well, and it cost this man his life.""","Son of a former Colombian senator and U.N. ambassador is seeking millions of dollars in damages .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Novak Djokovic began his quest for a fourth title at the Dubai Tennis Championships with a straight forward victory over fellow Serbian Victor Troicki. The 25-year-old won three consecutive titles in Dubai between 2009 and 2011 before 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer triumphed last year. Djokovic, who won the first major of the year at the Australian Open in January, is playing in his first ATP Tour event as he looks to maintain his unbeaten start to the season. His victory in Melbourne raised the prospect that Djokovic, who has won five of the last nine grand slam titles, could complete a clean sweep of the majors for the first time since Rod Laver in 1969. Asked whether he could go on another run like the one at the start of the 2011 season that saw him unbeaten for 43 matches he said in an on-court interview: ""Yes I am definitely am (on a streak). ""But I am not thinking about it or trying to better the one I had in 2011, because it's really hard to ask from myself something which may be impossible. ""But knowing that I have done it gives me that mental edge and confidence I need in to approach every tournament with self-belief."" Djokovic enjoys an impressive record over Troicki, losing just once in their last 13 encounters, and broke his opponent's first service game to set the tone for the match. Though the world No. 44 put up a better fight in the second set, Djokovic rarely looked in any danger as he wrapped up the match in just over an hour. ""Because I have not played for a while I was extremely focused and committed to starting well,"" Djokovic added. ""I played really, really well in the first set. I read his serve well, and I was aggressive in the court. So altogether I am satisfied with my performance and I hope I can continue."" Elsewhere, the No. 4 seed Juan Martin del Potro was forced to save three match points during a hard fought 4-6 6-4 7-6 victory over Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis. The Argentinean, who won the 14th ATP title of his career in Rotterdam recently, came close to losing the contest at 4-5 in the deciding set but battled back to take it on a tiebreak. He's a great player,"" del Potro told the ATP Tour's official website. ""He fights like me every point, and we had fantastic rallies. I'm so glad to beat him tonight in Dubai. ""I played fantastic forehands to keep playing this match. Then in the end, of course, you need a little bit of luck to win these kinds of matches, and I think I played solid on important points in the third."" Tomas Berdych, the No. 3 seed, had no such problems as he accounted for American wild card Rajeev Ram 6-1 6-3 in less than an hour. The 27-year-old was runner up to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at last week's Marseille Open, despite having a match point. He made the Dubai semis in 2011, losing to Djokovic. Nikolay Davydenko edged past the No. 6 seed, Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia. The Russian, who is retiring at the end of this year, triumphed 6-0 7-5. There were also victories on Thursday for Marcel Granollers, of Spain, Romania's Victor Hanescu, Tobias Kamke, from Germany and Russia's Dmitry Tursunov.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic into the second round of the Dubai Tennis Championships .

"(CNN) -- The United States, along with the United Kingdom and Canada, is refusing to sign a United Nations treaty on telecommunications and the Internet that has been under negotiation for the past two weeks. Terry Kramer, the U.S. Ambassador to the World Conference on International Telecommunications, said Thursday that ""the U.S. cannot sign the [treaty] in [its] current form."" ""We candidly cannot support an ITU treaty that is inconsistent with a multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance,"" said Kramer during a conference session. ""As the ITU has stated, this conference was never meant to focus on Internet issues. However, today we are in a situation where we still have text and resolutions that cover issues on spam and also provisions on Internet governance."" ""Internet policy should not be determined by member states but by citizens, communities, and broader society, and such consultation from the private sector and civil society is paramount,"" he continued. ""This has not happened here."" The U.S. decision to withdraw comes following a surprise move late Wednesday in which the chair of the conference called a voice vote on controversial proposal that encourages governments to help expand global Internet access. It was approved in a controversial manner that left some participants confused and upset. Additionally, many countries -- the U.S. included -- are opposed to including in the treaty any language about the Internet at all. Dr. Hamadoun I. TourÃ©, chair of the conference, released a statement arguing the agreed-upon treaty does not include Internet provisions. Instead, he said the controversial proposal voted upon Wednesday is found in a non-binding annexed resolution to the treaty. ""The conference did NOT [sic] include provisions on the Internet in the treaty text,"" said TourÃ©. ""Annexed to the treaty is a non-binding Resolution which aims at fostering the development and growth of the Internet."" Kramer had initially indicated the U.S. would remain engaged in negotiations after Wednesday's diplomatic ruckus. He also denied rumors the U.S. would be leaving the conference earlier this week. Later on Thursday, several other countries indicated they agreed the conference is the wrong forum to discuss Internet issues. Called the World Conference on International Telecommunications, or WCIT, the conference was intended to update a treaty governing international telecommunications that hasn't been refreshed since 1988. Since the conference began, the American delegation has argued that Internet governance issues are outside the scope of the conference. Other countries, including Russia and China, disagreed, submitting proposals intended to help governments fight cyberattacks and spam. The Americans -- and many open Internet advocates -- warned those proposals would be used to censor Internet users and would open the door to further disruptions to the open web. SEE ALSO: Unexpected controversy erupts at UN Internet conference . The U.S. also argued in favor of governments taking a hands-off approach to the Internet.

"(CNN) -- Savvy Internet users know that all the great stuff they get from the Internet us for ""free""—the searches, the social networks, the games, even the news—isn't really free. It's an exchange, where companies are able to take user data, sell it to advertisers, and make money that allows them to give themselves a paycheck while keeping you afloat in free digital services. So that data you're giving away online is worth something, but have you ever taken a stab at figuring out how much? A just-released privacy add-on for Firefox and Chrome, Privacyfix, gives it the old college try. Both Congress and the executive branch have been talking more about online privacy in the past couple years. The estimates for Google and Facebook are imprecise, as the program's creator, Privacy Choice founder Jim Brock, readily admits. ""We wanted people to understand, it is a value exchange"" when they use these sites, said Brock. Privacyfix measures your last 60 days of activity on Google, extrapolates that to a year, and uses a value-per-search estimate. Analysts believed Google was making $14.70 per 1,000 searches in 2010, and possibly less in 2011. Of course, if you spend all your time searching for luxury hotels or mesothelioma lawyers—and then clicking through the advertised links—you're much more valuable than the average user. Brock says his estimated annual Facebook value was a mere $1.68. His daughter, perhaps unsurprisingly, is at $12. His Google value checks in at more than $700 per year, though. The add-on also tells you how many of the websites you visit feed data back to Facebook and Google. I was surprised to see that Facebook is tracking me across 87 percent of the Internet, despite the fact that I'm a minimal user of Facebook. Privacyfix has a checklist for Facebook privacy settings, with orange warning signs near settings that users might want to take a look at. Unless you're a complete privacy hawk already—or you don't care at all—you'll probably find something new on that list that you weren't aware of. Did you know Facebook automatically shares your profile info when you visit certain sites? Did you know your profile details are sometimes shared not just with your friends, but often with the makers of your friends' apps? Privacyfix also gives you a heads-up on things you should be doing anyhow, like deleting Facebook apps you no longer use so that they stop gathering data. The add-on links you directly to those Facebook settings so you can fix them immediately, navigating you through a maze of privacy options some find arcane; it has a similar function for Google. ""I haven't had anyone go through this process who was not surprised by something [they saw],"" said Brock. While it isn't Brock's intention that all users should tightly clamp down their privacy controls, that's what most of the users of Privacyfix have chosen to do so far, he said. Future plans include similar privacy controls for Twitter and LinkedIn, as well as a mobile app. COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM .","New add-on attempts to measure the value of your data to websites .

"(CNN) -- With fallout still swirling from Apple's decision to replace Google Maps with its own mobile mapping, Google on Thursday announced the biggest upgrade ever to its Street View tool. The update adds more than 250,000 miles of roadways in 17 countries, said Ulf Spitzer, Google's Street View program manager, in a blog post Thursday. The Street View feature on Google Maps lets users see a real-world, 360-degree view of locations. Showcasing Google's global reach, the new coverage areas include parts of Macau, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, Taiwan, Italy, Great Britain, Denmark, Norway, Canada and the United States. Since launching in 2007, Google Street View had captured 20 petabytes of data in 48 countries. The company uses cars, trikes, snowmobiles and people outfitted with custom cameras to capture 360-degree images around the world. In the new update, Google also added a spate of ""special collections"" to the feature, providing virtual tours of attractions around the globe. ""Street View, as you know, is a useful resource when you're planning a route or looking for a destination, but it can also magically transport you to some of the world's picturesque and culturally significant landmarks,"" Spitzer said. The new spots include Catherine Palace and Ferapontov Monastery in Russia, Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taiwan and Stanley Park in Vancouver. Google Maps has been on the minds of many since Apple decided to replace it as the default mapping system on iOS 6, the latest version of its mobile operating system. The update coincided roughly with the release of the iPhone 5, meaning millions saw the new product for the first time after getting their new phones. Early reviews have not been kind. Apple's mapping software has been a spotty mess, missing huge chunks of the globe and, at times, placing notable landmarks in the wrong place, sometimes humorously so. The release was bad enough that Apple CEO Tim Cook issued a rare apology, saying in an open letter that Apple is ""extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused"" and promising to improve the feature. Google has been officially silent on whether it plans to release a new Google Maps app for iOS 6, which runs on iPhones, iPads and iPods. Reports suggest that it's doing so, but there's no guarantee Apple would approve it. In the past, the company has turned down apps that it deemed compete with its own features. That's a fact Google CEO Eric Schmidt acknowledged Wednesday, speaking at an All Things Digital conference, where he declined to confirm that a new version of maps is in the works for Apple mobile devices. ""Apple should have kept our maps,"" Schmidt said, according to GigaOM.","Google adds 250,000 miles to its Street View feature .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to say exactly what percentage of desktop and laptop computers run Apple OS X, but it's clear that the operating system has made slow but steady gains at chipping away at that the sizable lead Microsoft established in the '90s with its Windows operating system. Some figures put the number at about 6 to 7 percent of the desktop market. But one thing's for sure: OS X has been more successful than Linux, the open source operating system that has found a home on data-center servers but is still a rarity on desktops and laptops. Linux may have seen a surge last year, but it still hasn't seen the sort of growth OS X has, nor the growth that Linux supporters have long hoped for. Why is that? Miguel de Icaza -- one of the original creators of GNOME, a Linux desktop interface that has struggled to take hold -- believes that a large portion of the software developers that could have taken Linux to greater heights defected to other platforms, including not only Apple OS X but -- more importantly -- the Web. Some might blame the slow progress of desktop Linux on the fragmentation of the desktop user interfaces used by the major Linux distributions. In 2010, Canonical announced that it would replaced the popular GNOME desktop environment with its own homegrown Unity environment in the Ubuntu distribution, much to many Linux geeks' chagrin. But many are also unhappy with the direction GNOME has taken, including Linux creator Linus Torvalds, who posted a tirade about it on Google Plus last year. Torvalds switched to Xfce, a desktop environment originally created as a lighter-weight alternative to the dominant GNOME and KDE environments. The audio and video centric Ubuntu Studio completed a transition to Xfce last month, and earlier this month, the venerable Linux distribution Debian dropped GNOME as its default desktop environment and replaced it with Xfce. But de Icaza says the desktop wars were already lost to OS X by the time the latest shakeups started happening. And he thinks the real reason Linux lost is that developers started defecting to OS X because the developers behind the toolkits used to build graphical Linux applications didn't do a good enough job ensuring backward compatibility between different versions of their APIs. ""For many years, we broke people's code,"" he says. ""OS X did a much better job of ensuring backward compatibility."" But at the same time, development was shifting to the web. Open source on the desktop became a lot less important than open source on the server. The need to develop native applications was diminishing and at the same time OS X provided a good enough Unix-like environment that programmers could develop on a Mac and then deploy to a Linux server. The web is where open source truly thrives. Even Steve Ballmer admits that Linux is beating Windows in the web server market. Even if you don't have a single open source application installed on your laptop, if you use the web you're probably being served by several open source technologies, including web servers like Apache and Nginx and programming languages and frameworks like PHP and Ruby on Rails all running on an open source operating system. The latest trends in web technology, from cloud computing to big data, are also built on open source technologies such as Apache Hadoop, MongoDB and the Xen hypervisor. Open source powers the server side of the web, but there's no guarantee of openness on the user-facing side. And that's where open source advocates are focusing much of their efforts now, even if they have started using Macs. ""Many people who were talking about Free Software are the people talking about the open web now,"" de Icaza says. One of them is Stormy Peters, the former executive director of the GNOME Foundation. She's still on the GNOME Foundation board an like de Icaza she still keeps some Linux machines around. But as director of websites and developer engagement at the Mozilla Foundation, her focus is now on the open web. ""The reason I'm personally at Mozilla is that I saw a lot of websites that weren't designed with the principles of free software,"" she says. Thanks to AJAX and HTML5, the web has become the dominant platform for applications she says. In what ways can the principles of free software be applied to the web? Peters says one of the most important aspects of open source software is that you, or someone you trust, can examine an application's source code and see what it's doing. One way to bring this level of insight to the web is help users control their data and how it is used by web applications. That's the goal of Mozilla Identity team, who are working on Mozilla Persona, a browser-based identity and authentication system. Another big change since the early days of the Linux desktop is the rise of the mobile web. ""There's a huge portion of the world who are going to first experience the internet through the mobile devices,"" Peters say. To that end, Mozilla is working on its Boot to Gecko open source mobile operating system, but possibly more importantly is the Mozilla Marketplace. These applications will run anywhere that the Firefox web browser will. Mobile development is also on de Icaza's mind. Since 2001 he's been working on Mono, an open source framework for running Microsoft's .NET languages on non-Microsoft operating systems like Linux and OS X. Now the project is available on Android and iOS as well. Meanwhile, through all of this, GNOME and the Linux desktop are still chugging along. GNOME 3.6 is out, and is working to improve the developer experience. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- It was cute for a while. We had some fun. And a few Americans even learned to locate South Korea on a map. (I think it's near Pittsburgh.) But now it's time for all of us to come together and stop the madness. Thus, let it be known that I hereby declare October 12, 2012, as the day ""Gangnam Style"" died. Sorry, folks. We're done. It's officially no longer a thing. Psy seems like a really good dude, and I hate to have done this to his song, but this morning I slowly walked ""Gangnam Style"" out into the backyard, thanked it for the good times and shot it. ""Oppa is Old Yeller style!"" K-Pop star PSY: My video's more popular than me! The last straw came for me when I was searching the Web for interesting writing topics and stumbled upon yet another trending video of a group dance using this song. Too many people thought this mattered, and I just couldn't take it. Right then and there, I experienced what some people in the medical community might describe as a mild freakout. So, let me just give a big thanks to the random stranger who pulled my shaking, half-naked body out of the storm gutter near my house. Actually, that was last week and totally unrelated. But, nevertheless, thanks. iReport: Gangnam style from Pittsburg State University . Now, before I go any further, I probably need to stop and explain ""Gangnam Style"" to my mom and dad, who, at this moment, are completely lost. ""Honey, do you have any idea what Jarrett's talking about?"" ""Shhhh. Golf Channel."" Basically, Mom and Dad, ""Gangnam Style"" is a fun, catchy pop song by South Korean artist Psy. The official music video debuted on YouTube on July 15, went crazy viral and has since earned more than 430 million views. That said, dear parents, ""Gangnam Style"" is more than just a song. It's also a dance (sort of) whose main signature move can best be described as riding a horse or, perhaps, fornicating with a kangaroo. So, you know, enjoy that little visual, and I'll see you at Thanksgiving. As for the title: It actually refers to a posh district in Seoul where people are considered trendy and lavish, and the video colorfully exaggerates this uber-affluent lifestyle. In other words, one might say Beverly Hills is Gangnam Style. T.J. Maxx is not. (Though there does appear to be a T.J. Maxx in Beverly Hills, Michigan. Discuss.) For historical comparison, at least in my lifetime, I suppose the closest thing we've ever had to ""Gangnam Style"" was ""Macarena"" by Los del Rio. While the song ""Macarena"" -- and its signature dance, THE Macarena -- didn't enjoy the luxury of YouTube, it did somehow manage to become an international sensation in the mid-'90s. If you were at a party or a sporting event or (seriously) even the Democratic National Convention, you were (by penalty of death) required to dance the Macarena. And to this day, I still know it by heart. North Korean video evokes 'Gangnam Style' to taunt South Korean candidate . Mind you, I can barely remember what I was doing 30 seconds ago, but even after more than 15 years, I absolutely, positively recall every last move of the Macarena. Just to be sure, I demonstrated it for our 23-year-old intern and then asked if she'd like me to teach it to her. Her wise response: ""Do I have to?"" So we've long since rid ourselves of ""Macarena,"" and now we say goodbye to ""Gangnam Style."" They're not a perfect comparison, for as best as I can tell, ""Gangnam Style"" isn't necessarily a fully composed dance but more of a song that features several signature dance moves. I already described the main one, and the other biggie looks like some sort of crazed, hyper-animated version of the Axl Rose. Well, at least from back in the day when the Guns 'n Roses frontman didn't have to move around stage on a Rascal. The point is this: ""Gangnam Style"" is officially dead. True, the U.N. didn't grant me absolute authority to murder it in the backyard, but I assure you it's taken care of. So, no more group dancing. No more stadium JumboTrons. No more Internet parodies. It's done. Alas, I wish this old boy could've been put out to stud, but for the safety of future generations, ""Gangnam Style"" simply had to die. It won't see you at Thanksgiving.","I hereby declare October 12, 2012, as the day ""Gangnam Style"" died .

"(Time.com) -- For all the heady talk about misleadingly ""deific,"" recently confirmed quantum specks named after Scottish physicists, another kind of historic event just transpired: a record-shattering laser beam that, in a single shot fired on July 5, 2012, generated more power than the United States does at any single instant. Spooky or astonishing? How about both. Think of it as ""extreme sports science,"" a kind of lab-based game of automatic one-upmanship where researchers fiddle with incredibly complex, painstakingly calibrated machinery to produce unprecedented results -- then outdo them. Time.com: 9 examples of improbable superhero technology . That's what the National Ignition Facility -- home to the world's largest laser -- just did when it pulled the trigger on 192 beams of optically amplified, electromagnetic radiation-emitting light, all fired within a few trillionths of a second of each other, to deliver 500 trillion watts (or terawatts) of ""peak power"" and 1.85 megajoules of ultraviolet laser light. Framed in more eye-catching terms: The NIF says 500 terawatts outpaces the entire U.S. for power used ""at any instant in time,"" and that 1.85 megajoules amounts to roughly 100 times what any other laser produces regularly. No wonder those two power unit prefixes (tera, mega) come from Greek words meaning ""monster"" and ""great."" Then again, what else would you expect from a laser housed in a building the size of three football fields, or a science lab with a word like ""ignition"" in its moniker? The NIF, located in Livermore, California, came online in March 2009, and its goals are manifold: Its primary mission, given funding by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) -- ""a semi-autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy responsible for enhancing national security through the application of nuclear science to the nation's national security enterprise"" -- is to duplicate what happens in contemporary nuclear weapons, in part to render underground nuclear testing unnecessary. Time.com: Clamshell! The story of the greatest computing form factor of all time . But it's also a repository for scientists -- the same sort that poke around at sub-sub-atomic levels for elemental quantum particles -- looking to understand ""extreme states of matter that exist in the centers of planets, stars and other celestial objects."" And last but not least -- well beyond the holster-loaded conventions of mere pulp sci-fi skirmishing -- the NIF laser is about puzzling out something called ""fusion ignition"": the point at which nuclear fusion reactions become self-sustaining, to, in the NIF's words, ""provide abundant and sustainable clean energy."" Fusion reaction is arguably the most exciting of the NIF's goals: to catalyze self-sustaining nuclear fusion, wherein two light atomic nuclei ""fuse"" together and produce a single heavier nucleus while converting some of that mass to incredible amounts of energy. That, in so many words, is how stars are born, and it's something scientists have been working to achieve since the 1950s. The 500-terawatt shot on July 5 brings scientists closer to solving a longstanding physics challenge and arguably the field's holy grail: getting back more energy than you give. Time.com: Mission to Mars: 8 amazing tech tools aboard NASA's Curiosity Rover . ""The 500 TW shot is an extraordinary accomplishment by the NIF Team, creating unprecedented conditions in the laboratory that hitherto only existed deep in stellar interiors,"" said MIT physicist Dr. Richard Petrasso in a statement on the NIF's site. ""For scientists across the nation and the world who, like ourselves, are actively pursuing fundamental science under extreme conditions and the goal of laboratory fusion ignition, this is a remarkable and exciting achievement."" The July 5 shot was actually the NIF's third in a series of test fires, a series that's seen power ramped up by nearly 100 terawatts since March 15, when the NIF fired a shot that delivered 1.8 megajoules and peak power of 411 terawatts. And while electricity produced by sustained, controlled fusion reactions may not be commercially viable, well, ever, depending whom you talk to -- some say 30 to 40 years; others say indefinitely given the technical challenges of putting star-stuff in a container -- the July 5 laser shot appears to be a major step forward. ""NIF is becoming everything scientists planned when it was conceived over two decades ago,"" said NIF Director Edward Moses of the July 5 shot. In January 2012, Moses predicted that fusion ignition would happen ""in the next 6-18 months."" We're getting close, in other words, to what you might call ""the end of the beginning"" of the very long -- and expensive: an experimental international fusion reactor being built in France is said to cost 16 billion euros, or nearly US$20 billion -- road to theoretically limitless energy generation.

"(Mashable) -- Technology issues might not be the most pressing topic facing Paul Ryan — Mitt Romney's running mate — as he campaigns for the White House. In fact, given the state of the economy and the other high-level issues facing the country, it's unlikely that Ryan or any of the other national candidates will be asked substantial questions about technology policy in the coming months. However, even if Ryan doesn't get asked a single question about technology or the Internet, it's still possible to glean some of his positions from his voting record and prior interviews. Here, we have done just that. Stop Online Piracy Act & Internet piracy . The Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, was almost universally vilified by those in the tech community. Ryan never co-sponsored the bill, but that didn't stop rumors from circulating that he supported it. Eventually, Ryan was at least partially forced to make a statement on the bill by pressure from a group of anti-SOPA Reddit users who either found his stance vague or believed he supported the bill. That group began ""Operation Pull Ryan,"" a grassroots effort to support Ryan's opponent in an upcoming Congressional race. Soon after the Reddit group began gaining momentum, Ryan announced his opposition to SOPA, saying that it would create ""the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse."" He added that the Internet is ""one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history"" and it should ""stay that way."" He did, however, add that Internet piracy was a ""legitimate problem."" The opponent supported by the Redditors, Rob Zerban, declared his opposition to SOPA and did an ""Ask Me Anything,"" a form of crowdsourced interview for which Reddit has become famous. Later, Zerban credited the Redditor's efforts to get Ryan to commit to an anti-SOPA stance. ""Reddit was able to force the House Budget Chair to reverse course — shock waves will be felt throughout the establishment in Washington today, and other lawmakers will take notice,"" wrote Zerban. Net neutrality . Net neutrality, the idea that Internet networks shouldn't distinguish between the types of traffic carried across them, is a contentious issue in Congress. Many liberals feel it would prevent Internet Service Providers from slowing the web services of competitors, while many conservatives believe it interferes with the free market by regulating private industry. Ryan, a conservative Republican, falls into that latter camp. In 2006, he voted against a Democrat-sponsored amendment that would have established network neutrality as law. Last year, Ryan voted for a House resolution disapproving of FCC regulations mandating that any traffic management on the part of ISPs be ""reasonable"" — a step towards net neutrality. Open government . Ryan, who has an active online presence, is a proponent of open government and a fan of technology's impact on governance: . ""When I started in Congress it was 90% paper, 10% electronic, now it's 90% electronic, 10% paper and constituent correspondence is up tenfold,"" said Ryan of technology's impact on the relationship between voters and elected officials during an interview at Facebook. ""[Technology and social media] strips away the intermediary that media plays between people and their government. It gets rid of that middleman and allows people to interact directly with their elected officials. The flattening of that process has been tremendously helpful to those of us who want to hear what people think."" Is it important to you that the president and vice president share your opinion on technology issues? Do you want Ryan, Romney, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden to directly address their stances on tech policy? Share your thoughts in the comments.

"(CNN) -- Apple Store employees, dressed in matching blue T-shirts, clapped and sang and made intermittent ""woo!"" cheers, as they walked past John H., who was waiting in line to buy the iPhone 5 in Atlanta last month. The 29-year-old, who had never before waited in one of Apple's I-need-the-product-immediately-so-I'm-willing-to-stand-here-for-hours lines, didn't look amused. About the time the sun was coming up, John leaned against a railing at Lenox Square mall and pretty much scowled at all the hoopla. ""I didn't have anything better to do,"" he said of his decision to come to the mall and wait in line to buy the newest Apple smartphone. John, who asked that his last name not be used, had just come off of an overnight shift with an airline. ""My girlfriend's out of town,"" he added. ""I'm just hanging out."" One year after the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, that kind of indifference seems almost sacrilege when set against the history of Apple fanboy-dom that surrounds the company's product launches. And while it's true that that a woman in New York waited in line for eight days, braving rain, police, wrecks and everything else that would be horrible about sleeping outside in Manhattan for a week, the excitement for the iPhone 5 seemed less palpable than in the past, at least among the masses. The cause? That's anyone's guess. Maybe it's that this phone seems less exciting than its predecessors. Maybe it's harder for fans to drum up enthusiasm for Apple now that the once-scrappy underdog has become the world's richest and most powerful tech company. Or, more troubling for Apple loyalists, maybe some of the company's sparkle is fading with consumers now that Jobs, the design perfectionist, is no longer signing off on new products. #WhatSteveJobsTaughtMe: Share your thoughts on his life and career . Obviously, there's no lack of luster in Apple's stock price, which is reaching such heights -- it recently flirted with $700 a share -- that it's been accused of swaying trends for entire markets. And Apple sold 5 million iPhone 5s in the first weekend, although that number was less than analysts had expected given the attendant hype and pent-up demand for the device. A shift, however, seemed evident at the launch of the new phone, at least with the random sampling of consumers who spoke with CNN that morning. It's not that Apple isn't popular. It's that perhaps the fans aren't as hyped up as they used to be. For starters, no one would claim Apple as a hero of the counterculture these days. That was evident in the fact that some of the line-standers in Atlanta talked about the phone not as some life-altering blessing from on high (the iPhone has been dubbed the ""Jesus phone,"" let's remember) but in consumer-y and practical terms. One man, 31-year-old Nick Loner, wanted a better camera before he went on a family vacation. Ed Veillette, 45, was in line to buy the phone for his teenage son, who wanted to be able to show it off to friends in the school lunchroom. ""It could be a rock,"" Veillette said. ""If everybody had a rock, he'd want it."" Opinion: Apple seems to have gotten a little bit lost . The vibe shift was apparent to die-hard Apple fans as well. ""The excitement has settled,"" said Justin Henderson, 32, who has waited in line for the new Apple smartphone every year since the iPhone launched. ""The biggest line I've seen in the last five years was for the iPhone 4. That line was ridiculous."" This line? Less so. ""I think people know what they're getting, and they're just wanting to upgrade, versus getting the phone for the first time"" and being super-thrilled about it, he said. In a YouTube video of the recent opening of an Apple store in Stockholm, some customers looked nonplussed, if not downright perturbed, by Apple's clapping, chanting mob of blue-shirted employees. The company is having trouble controlling the tech pundits, too. In a post titled ""Confessions of a former Apple fanboy,"" blogger Roy Choi writes that he is losing faith in Apple's ability to gin up the same level of fanaticism in the post-Steve-Jobs era. ""I'm not saying this iPhone iteration is an awful device, but I question whether Apple has the ability to maintain industry-leading innovation,"" Choi writes on the site TechnoBuffalo. ""Apple has historically been known for creative design and disruptive technology, signature features that are surprisingly missing this time around. It is uncharacteristic of Apple to deliver an average product. My thoughts are that these specs can be found on nearly every other mid-to-high-end smartphone on the market."" Apple loyalist John Gruber, author of the influential blog Daring Fireball, wrote favorably about Amazon's unveiling of its newest iPad competitor. ""Om Malik argues that (Amazon CEO Jeff) Bezos is the inheritor to Steve Jobs's crown. I agree. Not because Bezos has copied anything Jobs did, but because he has not. What he's done that is Jobs-like is doggedly pursue, year after year, iteration after iteration, a vision unlike that of any other company -- all in the name of making customers happy."" Forbes points out that the iPhone 5 was supposed to cement Jobs' legacy. ""Reports around Steve Jobs' passing talked about how he was focused on the iPhone 5 during his last days and predicted that it would be his 'legacy device,' "" contributor Chunka Mui writes. ""That seemed plausible, given Jobs' reputation and the incremental nature of the iPhone 4S that came out around the same time, and helped to heighten the anticipation for this week's iPhone 5 launch. ""The new iPhone does not meet those lofty 'legacy' aspirations, however. The iPhone 5 is bigger, faster, thinner, etc. -- definitely a creditable offering that reiterates Apple's design, engineering and marketing chops. While it does nothing to detract from Jobs' design genius reputation, it does nothing to enhance it, either."" Apple has come under fire for its new error-filled maps application, which replaces Google Maps on iPhone 5s and in iOS 6, the company's new mobile operating system. In a rare public letter, Apple CEO Tim Cook apologized for the quality of the maps last week. Frustrated iPhone 5 users have also complained about a bug that causes their phones to suck cellular data even when connected to a Wi-Fi network. Of course, there's always a counter-argument. Here's one from Kris Abarilla, who responded to my question about the changing state of Apple fanboydom on Google+: ""Fanboydom certainly hasn't changed much since Jobs. The people are loyal to the brand, not to the person who ran it. ""Even after people realize how bad the Maps App is in the new iOS 6, those very same users are touting the greatness of Apple."" It's clear Apple employees (check out this gallery; hilarious) and the company's fanboy and fangirl loyalists will continue not just to buy Apple products but to love them, and the company behind them. The question is: What about everyone else? ""Though Apple will remain a highly profitable company for years to come, I would be surprised if it ever gives us another product as transformative as the (original) iPhone or the iPad,"" writes Joe Nocera in the New York Times' opinion section. ""Part of the reason is obvious: Jobs isn't there anymore,"" he wrote. ""It is rare that a company is so completely an extension of one man's brain as Apple was an extension of Jobs. While he was alive, that was a strength; now it's a weakness. Apple's current executive team is no doubt trying to maintain the same demanding, innovative culture, but it's just not the same without the man himself looking over everybody's shoulder.""

"(CNN) -- Last year, Gideons International distributed more than 84 million printed copies of the Bible around the world to students, hospitals, members of the military and, of course, hotels, where they are a ubiquitous sight in bedside tables. Starting this month, however, the InterContinental Hotels Group is modernizing that mission at one of its hotels, replacing the paper tomes with electronic versions of the Bible loaded on Kindle e-readers. Each of the 148 rooms at the chain's Hotel Indigo in Newcastle, England, will be outfitted with a Kindle with Wi-Fi. Guests can use the e-ink devices to catch up on scripture, as well as purchase and read any other books available in the Amazon Kindle store. The hotel was chosen for the pilot program because of its rich literary and publishing history: It's a few blocks from the Philosophical Society of Newcastle, one of the largest independent libraries in the UK. If it's a success, InterContinental could expand it to other locations, and other hotels might follow its lead. The hotel's Bible-on-a-Kindle initiative has no connection to Gideons, a Tennessee-based Evangelical group and association of Christian professional men founded in 1899. However, the nonprofit group has no reservations about the hotel's program. ""Anything to put the Bible in people's hands is a good thing,"" Gideons spokesman Ken Stephens said. ""It is a fascinating idea, and I'm sure somehow, some way, its time will come for us. But right now just the paper version is the best for what we do."" Stephens pointed out that paper books are more economical for large-scale distribution. Each Gideons Bible costs the organization about $5 to print and distribute. Although there are many free e-book versions of the Bible floating around online, a 6-inch Kindle e-reader retails in the U.S. for $109 (or about $139 in the UK). Given the high price tag, Hotel Indigo is keeping close tabs on the devices. Just like with fluffy hotel robes, the full cost of any pilfered Kindle will be charged to a guest's credit card. For the first two weeks of the program, the hotel is allowing guests to download any other religious texts they like, up to $8 in value, for free. If guests purchase other books to read, the cost will be charged directly to their rooms. However, they can't take the books with them, and the Kindles are wiped clean between visitors. ""As downloads will be synced to the hotel's account, guests will only be able to read the downloaded book during their stay,"" an InterContinental representative said. Guests not keen on paying for an e-book they might have to abandon halfway through can choose from the 15,000 free titles in Amazon's free e-book collection. The Gideons' hotel Bible project began in the U.S. in 1908 and has spread to 194 countries around the world. The group estimates it has distributed 1.7 billion Bibles in the project's 104-year history. While distributing pricey e-reading devices isn't much of a threat to Gideons, it's likely that the proliferation of e-reading features on all mobile devices could make a dent in demand.","Hotel Indigo in England may be the first to replace bedside Bibles with Kindles .

"(CNN) -- Photo-sharing app Instagram has attracted more than 100 million users by encouraging people to snap pictures with their smartphones, dress them up with filters and share them with friends. In the two years since Instagram launched, it's been a mobile-only network for an increasingly mobile society. Now that's about to change. Instagram announced Monday it will be adapting user photos and data into Web-based profiles for people to enjoy from laptops or desktops. Each Web profile will feature a selection of recently shared photographs along with the user's profile photo and bio, offering a quick visual snapshot of someone's interests and aesthetic. ""We're launching Web profiles to give you a simple way to share your photos with more people and to make it easier to discover new users on the Web,"" Instagram said in a blog post. Photos are expandable on the new Web pages, meaning your followers will be able to view your prized pics in a larger, 6x6-inch format instead of peering at those little square images on their phones. ""It strikes me that a quick, dynamic overview of your life in pictures is maybe even more compelling than the overall Facebook Timeline because it's so simple. Everyone understands pictures,"" wrote tech columnist and prolific Instagram user MG Siegler on his blog. Users won't be able to upload images to their accounts from the Web, although they can follow others, comment and like photos. It's a big upgrade over Instagram's traditionally bare-bones website, which has contained little more than a blog and information for app developers. The new interface creates a challenge for the ecosystem of independent sites that had sought to fill Instagram's Web void by offering browser-based platforms for viewing, liking and commenting on photos from the app. They include Statigram, which gives users a detailed breakdown of data concerning their Instagram feed, and Webstagram, a more straightforward photo viewing site. Instagram says its Web profiles will launch for all users in the next week or so. ""If you can't see your profile yet, rest assured that you'll see it in the next few days,"" the company says. Instagram also says that if your photos are set to private, they will be visible on the Web only to Instagram users you've allowed to follow you. Instagram photos show Sandy's path of damage . To see your profile or to explore a friend's profile, go to Instagram.com/[username]. Here's an example of how it will look.

"(CNN) -- Is hip design more important than being green? Technology giant Apple is catching heat on blogs this week for its decision to drop out of an environmental certification program for electronics, called EPEAT. ""In making this move, Apple is signaling that it won't let future design decisions be governed by those seeking to uphold environmental standards,"" Erica Ogg writes for the GigaOm blog network. The decision has some strong ramifications. By U.S. law, 95% of electronics purchases from U.S. federal agencies must be EPEAT-compliant, said Sarah O'Brien, spokeswoman for the group. That probably means Apple desktop and laptop computers can make up a maximum of 5% of federal agencies' purchases, if they can buy them at all. EPEAT doesn't certify tablets or phones, so iPads and iPhones would be OK for the agencies to buy, O'Brien said. San Francisco also has a rule on the books prohibiting the city from purchasing desktop and laptop computers that are not EPEAT-certified, said Christine Falvey, spokeswoman for the mayor. So the city will not be able to purchase Apple desktops and laptops unless Apple gets the green certification again. ""We hope they reconsider and get back on the EPEAT certification list,"" Falvey said, ""and we'll be reaching out to them to see how we can help understand their decision."" Apple hasn't commented on why it removed itself from EPEAT, which is awarded to electronics that are recyclable and energy-efficient. But EPEAT's CEO, Robert Frisbee, says Apple's ""design direction"" may be to blame. ""They said their design direction was no longer consistent with the EPEAT requirements,"" Frisbee told the Wall Street Journal. ""They were important supporters and we are disappointed that they don't want their products measured by this standard anymore."" So what's the design hangup? There's speculation that Apple's new line of ""retina display"" laptops aren't easily recyclable because their batteries are glued to the aluminum case on the computer. ""At the heart of the controversy is the company's newest MacBook Pro with Retina Display, which Apple designed in such a way that it's difficult to disassemble for the sake of repairs, upgrades, and recycling,"" wrote InfoWorld. Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet issued a statement to CNN via e-mail: ""Apple takes a comprehensive approach to measuring our environmental impact and all of our products meet the strictest energy efficiency standards backed by the U.S. government, Energy Star 5.2. We also lead the industry by reporting each product's greenhouse gas emissions on our website, and Apple products are superior in other important environmental areas not measured by EPEAT, such as removal of toxic materials."" She declined to comment further. On its website, Apple says the MacBook Pro is recyclable (PDF): . ""Through ultra-efficient design and the use of highly recyclable materials, Apple has minimized material waste at the product's end of life. In addition, Apple offers and participates in various product take-back and recycling programs in 95% of the regions where Apple products are sold."" In a statement posted on its website last month, EPEAT did not elaborate on Apple's reasons for quitting the standard, which the company and other industry leaders helped create. ""We regret that Apple will no longer be registering its products in EPEAT. We hope that they will decide to do so again at some point in future,"" the group says. Greenpeace ranks Apple in the middle of the pack of tech companies -- behind HP and Dell but ahead of Samsung, Sony and others -- in terms of its sustainability and environmental friendliness. What do you think of the decision? More important, will it affect whether you purchase Apple products?","Apple drops green electronics certification called EPEAT .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Geek is chic these days, especially around the San Diego Convention Center. The worlds of Hollywood, video games and comic books collided for four days at the annual International Comic-Con 2012. Gaming has always played an important role in this pop-culture convention. Several of the larger Hollywood studios -- Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures -- sat out ""the Con"" this year, which opened up more room for the growing number of online series from the likes of YouTube, Hulu and Netflix as well as gaming. In some instances these worlds collided as Microsoft showcased the talent behind the live-action series ""Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn."" Hollywood also remains infatuated with games as a big-screen source of inspiration. Sony Pictures debuted footage from ""Resident Evil: Retribution 3D,"" the fifth film in the successful franchise starring Milla Jovovich. Capcom creators showed attendees a first look at ""Resident Evil 6,"" which will hit PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 just a few weeks after the movie opens September 14. Open Road Films and Konami Digital Entertainment offered a similar double feature with ""Silent Hill Revelation 3D"" making its movie debut in the main hall while just down the street the game makers showed its interactive cousin, ""Silent Hill: Book of Memories."" Walt Disney Animation Studios explored the classic world of arcade games with ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" a new computer animated adventure featuring the voices of Sarah Silverman and John C. Reilly. Activision will be releasing games for Nintendo's platforms based on this film. More game publishers used Comic-Con to debut brand new titles, even though the show is just a month after the big E3 convention. But while that trade show is closed to the public, the San Diego shindig allowed game makers to reach the socially active early adopters that Hollywood and other marketers have long coveted by giving them hands-on time with some of the biggest games of this year (and next). Here are five new games worth checking out that debuted at the show: . ""Marvel Heroes"" (Gazillion Entertainment, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, 2013) While Sony Online Entertainment continues to allow gamers to explore the world of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman with DC Universe Online, that popular massively multiplayer online, or MMO, game only allows fans to play alongside those iconic characters. ""Marvel Heroes"" is the first licensed comic book MMO that will allow players to step into the roles of Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America and a full roster of Marvel superheroes. In the game world, Doctor Doom has gotten his hands on the Cosmic Cube -- also known as the ""Tesseract"" in this summer's ""The Avengers"" movie. It's up to players to save the world. The game, at least at launch, will focus heavily on New York, complete with Mutant Town, but there will also be locations such as Savage Land. Fans can don their virtual costumes and play with friends starting next year. ""Spartacus Legends"" (Ubisoft, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, 2013) Starz Entertainment has made swords and sandals cool again with Steven DeKnight's ""Spartacus"" TV series. Now Ubisoft and developer Kung Fu Factory are bringing the fighting action home in the first console game based in this graphic novel-infused bloody world. The game features actors from the show, including Liam McIntyre (who plays Spartacus) and Manu Bennett (who plays Crixus). Fans will also be able to create their own gladiators and fight in the same arenas featured in the series. One catch that's sure to pique the interest of fighting fans is that when a warrior has fallen in combat, if the victor decides to vanquish his opponent, that character is dead forever. That adds a whole new twist to the game's online experience as players can build up powerful gladiators, train them and arm them with an assortment of weapons and then see them die in battle. The Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network title will debut in early 2013 in conjunction with the final season of the show, ""Spartacus: War of the Damned."" ""The Expendables 2"" (Ubisoft, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3) Sylvester Stallone returned to Comic-Con, which helped generate buzz for the action flick that has become a franchise -- complete with a new game. Developer Zoot Fly has worked closely with Stallone to craft an original story that bridges the gap between the two films. This prequel to the August 17 movie sequel from Lionsgate and Millenium Films puts players in control of four characters from the movie -- Barney Ross (Stallone), Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Yin Yang (Jet Li). The four-player co-op game sends players on a mission to rescue a kidnapped billionaire. The action blends isometric shooting with vehicle combat in helicopters and tanks across locales such as the Somalian deserts and Burmese jungles. Each character has a specialty, such as sniper or demolitions expert, as well as a signature kill that players can use, such as Ross' dual pistols, for an up-close offing of an enemy. The game debuts on PlayStation Network on July 31 and hits PC and Xbox Live Arcade on August 17. ""Fortnite"" (Epic Games, PC, 2013) Epic Games, which also showcased the Xbox 360 exclusive prequel, ""Gears of War: Judgment"" at Comic-Con, debuted its first Unreal Engine 4 game, ""Fortnite,"" during a panel. The gameplay is split into two unique experiences. Players will explore, forage, collaborate and build by day in their own dynamic and expanding world. Once the sun goes down, they'll work together to defend their fortress from zombies and other assorted creatures. The building system has been designed so that players can use scavenged materials to build and renovate structures of varying materials and complexity quickly. The game, which offers a third-person perspective and overhead view of the action, shows off the potential of next-generation (PlayStation 4 and Xbox Next) visuals by giving gamers a taste of what Unreal Engine 4 can do. The blend of strategy and survival horror serves as something fresh from the game developer best known for its shooters. ""Fortnite"" will be released in 2013 for the PC. ""The Walking Dead"" (Activision/Terminal Reality, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, 2013) Fans of AMC's hit show ""The Walking Dead,"" based on Robert Kirkman's graphic novel, already have a fun interactive adventure from Telltale Games. While that episodic horror game is based on the source material, developer Terminal Reality is serving up a prequel to the TV series starring popular characters Daryl and Merle Dixon. Players will contend with ""walkers"" (zombies) as they make their way to the supposed safety of Atlanta after an outbreak has left the country overrun with the living dead. The first-person action game features Daryl's crossbow as well as an assortment of other weapons that players can scavenge as they contend with obstacles living and dead in a brand new adventure. The Emmy-winning series has been able to blend horror with drama, but this game will allow fans to experience this rich universe with an action and horror focus. These walkers are fast and can hunt down players in hordes, which makes for an interesting new game experience for the growing number of fans. Activision unleashes the dead in 2013.","Several large Hollywood studios didn't participate this year, leaving room for gaming .

"(Mashable) -- Demand for Google's 7-inch Nexus 7 tablet seems to have well exceeded the tech giant's expectations. Last week, Google posted a message to its online store saying that shipments of the 16GB model were delayed one to two weeks. Now, the store has stopped taking orders altogether. Those who want to purchase the $249 version of the tablet are told to sign up to be notified by e-mail when it is back in stock. The 16GB version is also sold out at GameStop, Kmart, Sam's Club, Office Depot, Staples, B&H, Best Buy in Canada and, according to The Guardian, Tesco in the UK. The only place to get the device online at this point may be eBay. Google is still accepting orders for the 8GB version however, which costs $199.

"(CNN) -- The 1964-model Cadillac hearse that carried President John F. Kennedy's body and casket after his assassination is to be auctioned Saturday in Scottsdale, Arizona, the auctioneer's representatives said. Following his 1963 assassination in Dallas, the white hearse carried Kennedy's body from Parkland Memorial Hospital to Love Field, where Air Force One was waiting to transport the casket to Washington. First lady Jacqueline Kennedy was a passenger in the car during the ride, auctioneer Barrett-Jackson Auction Company said. The car, which has a green-and-white interior, was built for display as a new model year introduction at the National Funeral Home Directors Association Convention in Dallas in October 1963. The O'Neal Funeral Home in Dallas bought it at the close of the convention. The car is listed as having eight cylinders and a four-speed automatic transmission. Kennedy was slain on November 22, 1963. The funeral home had the contract with Parkland for both the hearse and ambulance service, and it provided the casket and hearse for the drive from the hospital, where Kennedy was pronounced dead, the auction house said. The O'Neal Funeral Home owned the hearse until the late 1960s when Arrdeen Vaughan, believed to be an employee, bought it. Vaughan sold it more than four decades later to its current and third owner, whose name wasn't disclosed. The hearse driver who transported Kennedy's casket, Aubrey Rike, died in 2010, the auction firm said. ""It's an honor to be able to offer a vehicle of this stature,"" Barrett-Jackson Auction Company Chairman and CEO Craig Jackson said in a statement. ""While its duty was solemn, it was also extremely important and played a crucial role in transporting the president so he could be laid to rest."" ""The eyes of the world were on this car on that unforgettable day in American history,"" Steve Davis, president of Barrett-Jackson, said in a statement.","The 1964-model Cadillac hearse transported Kennedy's casket after his assassination .

"(CNN) -- In advance of Friday, the first anniversary of the death of Apple's co-founder, we published a story pondering a question many in the tech world have been asking for a while: Who will be the next Steve Jobs? We put forward seven names, along with pros and cons for each: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Apple Senior Vice President Jonathan Ive, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, Paypal and Tesla Motors co-founder and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and SCVNGR and LevelUP CEO Seth Priebatsch. What followed was a lively, mostly thoughtful discussion by you, our readers. Hundreds of people took to the comments section to reflect on Jobs' legacy (the good, the bad and the ugly of it) and consider the question at hand. You gave your opinions on the folks we mentioned, suggested names that we didn't include and pondered whether anyone can ever be another Jobs -- or whether anyone should be. Here are some of our favorite comments from the discussion (with minor tweaks for spelling and grammar). On how our candidates in the story stack up: . groo22 . Elon Musk is fantastic. He's either going to be one of the best CEOs ever, or he's going to burn out with the most inventive vision probably anyone ever had. I hope he has success. You can't compare him to Steve Jobs though, their goals are not the same. Elon is way better and may very well cement his name as the best CEO of this generation and possibly this century. Piscesgal609 . I'm not much of a techie, but I'd have to say Zuckerberg because Facebook, like Apple, has changed the world and the way we do things. Plus they're both geeks and started at a very young age, both are arrogant, etc. bhartman36 . Of the people pictured, I'd say the ""next Jobs"" title has to go to Bezos. In fact, I think Amazon's innovations began to eclipse those of Apple even before Jobs' death. There's more growth and innovation going on between one generation of Kindle (be they e-ink or Fire) to the next than there is between one generation of iPhone/iPod/iPad to the next. Brian Jones . Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Marissa Mayer -- we need products we can touch and experience, not folks running server farms. My vote goes to Elon Musk. Just like Jobs, when others pooh-poohed his ideas, he made it happen. rkel . I would say Musk. The guy truly innovated how we do e-commerce, and SpaceX is another bold idea. To say that he hasn't changed how we live is shortsighted, considering the effect Paypal has on commerce and what it has pioneered online. It may not be as direct to touch, but most any time I buy something online, he is involved. Big ideas and big vision, stuff that seems so radical, that is where innovation will come from. On whom we left out: . njsokalski . Don't forget about the other big Steve: Steve Ballmer of Microsoft. Microsoft has started joining the hardware side of the industry along with the software side, and they are also growing in the mobile and consumer parts as well. Yes, they are still a little bigger with commercial & business customers, but consumers are becoming a bigger part of that. Also, don't forget developers. I do software, app and web development at home, and that has not only helped keep me as a Microsoft customer, but helped me discover and love even more Microsoft products. ayacsa . Without a doubt it's Mark Shuttleworth, the man behind the Ubuntu Linux Distribution and Canonical, the company that supports Ubuntu. Swoops07 . I think the question should be, who will be the next Bill Gates? Gates has done more to shape the world than Jobs could have ever done. He has also given back so much more than the greedy Steve Jobs. Gates has literally saved lives with his generosity. Michael Wellman . Technologically speaking, Gates certainly has done more to advance the current state of technology than any one single person (that I can think of) currently living. ... He may not have been as trendy as Jobs or had the eye for trendsetting like Jobs did (though, even that is arguable, as most of the work was done by Apple's fleet of designers), but he certainly has a better heart and mind. Others mentioned: Twitter and Square co-founder Jack Dorsey, Google creators Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs and, for reasons we can't quite comprehend, Vladimir Putin. There won't (or shouldn't) be another Steve Jobs: . BadaJohn . There is no one as complex, demanding, quirky or brilliant -- all wrapped up in one package -- as Jobs. Truly unique. Won't be another like him. KeyserSozeRu . We really don't need another Steve Jobs. R.I.P. We need another Einstein, another Churchill, a lot more da Vincis, another Lincoln, more (Martin) Luther Kings, Gandhis, Beethovens, Chaplins ... and Chuck Norris! Seriously, Steve Jobs is way overrated. Even as a manager he sucked. madelefant . No one. I have sort of a theory of an era that begins with Andy Warhol's soup cans and ends with Jobs' death. To me, Andy Warhol's soup can art conveyed the idea of the iconic image of a physical product living on its own, becoming disembodied. Jobs and Apple became the real-world realization of that. We are at the point where there really isn't anything new to invent in this area. bluewaters4567 . Was there the next Edison? Was there the next Einstein? Was there the next (scientist Michael) Faraday? Why should there be a next Jobs? The beauty of creation is that it never produces duplicates. That is what we do. Rendar888 . There are brilliant scientists among us right now creating remarkable things: advanced cybernetics, nanotech, AI, better medicines. If you mean a person who will make new-looking computers and phones, it will be someone we haven't seen yet or haven't been paying attention to. Definitely won't be Zuckerberg, Bezos or Mayer. There will always be a new torchbearer. ... They could show up tomorrow.","Friday will be the first anniversary of the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs .
We considered whether any current tech figures will become ""the next Steve Jobs""

"Madrid (CNN) -- British police arrested a man wanted for an attempt to assassinate the king of Spain more than a decade ago, they announced Thursday. Spanish national Eneko Gogeaskoetxea Arronategui was detained in an armed operation in the city of Cambridge, England, police said. He is suspected by the Spanish authorities of being a member of the Basque separatist group ETA. Members of ETA allegedly tried to kill Spain's King Juan Carlos when he attended the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, in October 1997. ""It doesn't matter where they go, there'll always be a police officer after them. They have it very difficult. We are not going to change this until ETA ends its violence,"" Spanish Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters Thursday after the arrest was announced. Rubalcaba said it was believed that the suspect held a high position in ETA logistics around 2006 and 2007 but that his current role with the ETA -- if there is one -- is under investigation. Rubalcaba also said he did not think there was a stable ETA structure in Britain, according to Spanish media reports. Gogeaskoetxea, 44, is due to appear in court in London later Thursday. The European arrest warrant states Gogeaskoetxea is wanted for participation in an armed gang; attempted assassination of the king; terrorism resulting in death; possession of weapons; theft and forgery. The offenses are alleged to have taken place on October 18, 1997, in Spain. Gogeaskoetxea's arrest comes a day after that of ETA suspect Daniel Derguy, who was detained in the town of Cahors, in southern France. According to anti-terror sources cited by the Spanish newspaper El Pais, Gogeaskoetxea moved to Britain with his family in early 2010, using false papers. El Pais reports that his brother Ibon Gogeaskoetxea, an alleged ETA leader, was arrested in February last year in France. ETA has been waging an armed struggle since the late 1960s for an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain and southwestern France. It is blamed for the deaths of more than 800 people over the decades, while several thousand others have been wounded. ETA is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","NEW: Spain's deputy PM says the suspect's current role in the ETA is under investigation .

"(Wired) -- Even six months ago, Apple TV was the big snoozer in Apple's consumer hardware line-up. The device is a simple set-top media puck â€” not much more than a passive conduit for piping iTunes, Netflix and iPad content to one's TV. But, oh, how times have changed. On the eve of WWDC 2012 -- Apple's annual developers' conference -- speculation swirls around Apple's positioning as a television manufacturer, and how Apple TV might play into a greater television hardware strategy. Indeed, an Apple TV reboot could be a game changer. And it would also be the WWDC highlight for users of the set-top puck, for app developers, and even for the TV entertainment industry at large. Now, granted, Apple just revamped the Apple TV user interface with the launch of the third-generation iPad. So in some respects, it seems unlikely that Apple would feature the product in another media event just a few months later. But the streaming TV companion still offers vast untapped potential. And with the attendance of thousands of devoted developers, WWDC is the perfect venue to announce a new Apple TV platform that exposes API support. And we can't forget how Tim Cook recently said the TV space is ""an area of intense interest"" for Apple. Apple TV is one of the best set-top devices in a consumer electronics category that, quite frankly, doesn't enjoy mass consumer report. Think about it: How many of your non-techie friends own either a Roku, Boxee Box, Google TV or Apple TV? Nonetheless, Apple TV sales are picking up momentum: The device is on track to sell twice as many units as were sold in 2011. The upshot: Apple doesn't need to announce its own television set at WWDC to make waves in the living room space. If it can reinvent Apple TV into a truly compelling, mass-market consumer product, it can realize Steve Jobs' dream of finally cracking the television code. Apple just needs to address a few key areas before Apple TV becomes a really big deal. Apps, apps, and AirPlay . ""What we might see at WWDC is Apple opening up the app economy approach they've had with the iPhone and iPad to the Apple TV,"" Gartner analyst Michael McGuire told Wired. Apple has well over 600,000 apps in the iOS App Store, but only eight third-party content choices (e.g., Netflix, MLB.com, Flickr, etc.) on Apple TV. So WWDC offers the perfect opportunity to introduce developers to how they could start expanding Apple TV's repertoire of content choices. Indeed, BGR reported that Apple would be introducing an entirely new OS and API for developers to take advantage of. There are two possible ways Apple could open up the Apple TV platform to third-party app developers: It could allow devs to create dedicated TV apps, or it could more heavily leverage (and open up) the AirPlay feature already baked into Apple TV to port existing iPad apps to the big screen. ""We've been focused on trying to understand how the app model evolves with the introduction of the TV platform,"" Jeremy Allaire, CEO of online video platform Brightcove told Wired. Indeed, Allaire detailed his thoughts on what could be next for Apple TV in an op-ed Monday morning. Allaire believes that instead of requiring developers to code for a third application platform (the TV), AirPlay Mirroring could be used with existing iPad apps. AirPlay Mirroring ""essentially turns your iPad into a powerful TV Apps platform that can render any application on the TV while enabling the user to use their touch-based device to browse, select, navigate, etc.,"" Allaire wrote in his piece. It makes sense. iPad apps are already built for a screen with a lot of real estate, and it wouldn't be unnatural to, say, flick through Wired's iPad app with your finger while actually reading the content on the big screen. ""AirPlay functionality is a bit hidden from users and not super easy for developers to implement,"" Allaire said of the feature in its current state, so there's ample room for improvement. NPD principal analyst Ross Rubin also believes ""a multiscreen component that builds off AirPlay"" could be in the stars. More content . ""To get people beyond the hardcore Mac fans, you need a lot of content,"" McGuire said. For example, average consumers want to see sports â€” live sports. So, for the Apple TV to break out of its ""hobby"" label (a label Tim Cook might wish he had never used), its content offerings will need to drastically expand. But live content is hard to come by without a cable or satellite subscription, and that may remain so. ""History has shown that Apple hasn't shown the same kind of influence with the studios that they had with the [music] labels in the early days of the iPod,"" Rubin said. However, in light of recent announcements on the Xbox platform, McGuire thinks Apple could be inking deals with the same content providers who've partnered with Microsoft: ESPN, NBA, Univision, and Nickelodeon. To go mainstream and become a true cable/satellite replacement for cord cutters, Apple TV would need to provide the ""equivalent experience of hundreds of programming options at any point in time,"" McGuire said. Expanded app offerings could certainly help with this, but live streaming content would really seal the deal. Ditch the remote . ""The other area that's getting a lot of rumor traction is opening up the Siri interface, which for both the existing apps on Apple TV, as well as new apps, could be very interesting,"" McGuire said. This could be accomplished through a peripheral add-on to Apple TV, as Allaire proposed for a forward-looking Apple TV experience. And, of course, Siri could handshake with the current Apple TV via coordination with the iPhone 4S (and maybe even the third-generation iPad, if it too receives Siri support as rumored.) Apple could also take an Xbox Kinect-like approach, launching camera devices in its TV products for 3-D gesture recognition. As for relevance to WWDC, this would mean a new gesture-based motion API for developers to manage user interaction and face detection, with an actual hardware accessory to arrive in the more distant future. But, heck, Apple already has patents on 3-D gesture recognition using the iPad, so perhaps an additional accessory isn't even necessary. ""Apple can do a lot with the box they have in terms of disrupting and changing people's expectations of what TV is,"" McGuire said.

"(CNN) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday ordered U.S. nuclear power plants to begin implementing safety recommendations made in an effort to prevent a crisis from occurring as it did in Japan after last year's devastating earthquake and tsunami. Among the recommendations, plants must install improvements to protect safety equipment and devices to monitor water levels in spent fuel pools. A third order applies only to plants with boiling-water reactors that have so-called Mark I or Mark II containment structures. Mark I containment housing is the same design that was used at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, where three reactors melted down after the station was struck by the tsunami that followed Japan's historic earthquake in March 2011. The disaster resulted in the widespread release of radioactive contamination that forced more than 100,000 people from their homes. The disaster occurred when a 15-meter (49-foot) tsunami inundated the coastal plant, knocking out the cooling systems for the three operating reactors and their associated spent fuel pools, causing the reactors to overheat and hydrogen gas explosions that blew apart the building housing reactors No. 1 and 3. Another hydrogen blast is believed to have damaged the inside of the No. 2 reactor, while engineers were struggling to manage an estimated 100,000 tons of highly contaminated water that was used to cool the reactors during the emergency. ""These reactors must improve venting systems that help prevent or mitigate core damage in the event of a serious accident,"" the NRC said in a news release announcing the orders for U.S. plants. In addition to the changes in safety procedures, the NRC is also seeking information from every operating U.S. nuclear power plant regarding risks caused by earthquakes and flooding and the plants' emergency procedures in the event of prolonged power loss. The plants have until the end of 2016 to fully comply with the safety orders, according to the NRC.","Plants have until 2016 to comply with orders .

"(CNN) -- A former soldier arrested after a hostage incident at a military base in Georgia faces multiple charges that include threatening to kill President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, according to federal court documents filed Tuesday. Robert Anthony Quinones, 29, of Hinesville, Georgia, was arrested Monday after the two-hour hostage situation at Winn Community Hospital on Fort Stewart, about 45 miles from Savannah, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Officials and a family member said he had demanded mental health care at the hospital. Quinones is charged with assault of a federal officer and kidnapping in the incident, which ended with the gunman's surrender and no injuries. After he was taken into custody and during interviews, Quinones ""expressed his plans, preparation and intentions to kill President Obama and former President Clinton,"" according to an affidavit filed in federal cour. ""Quinones detailed his studies of Secret Service protocols, sniper techniques and means of disguise and weapons concealment to implement his assassination plans."" A search of his residence resulted in the discovery of 11 long guns, four pistols, multiple rounds of ammunition and dozens of bayonets and knives, according to the affidavit. Authorities also found books and manuals about FBI hostage rescue teams, Osama bin Laden, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, the Russian Mafia and other topics, according to the affidavit signed by FBI and Secret Service agents. Quinones, when asked if he would kill Obama or Clinton if given a chance, said, ""Yes. On a scale of 1 to 10 about being serious, I am a 10,"" the affidavit said. Quinones was discharged from the military in February and had a civilian job at Fort Stewart, said the FBI, which released no other information on his military record. Quinones' mother, Janet Gladwell, told the Associated Press he was medically discharged from the Army months ago because he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. A neighbor, Jerry Franklin, said he had known Quinones for several years. ""He was a good kid,"" he said. Franklin, 48, an Army retiree, said Quinones would talk with he and other veterans because they understood the stress brought on by combat. Quinones had served two tours in Iraq, said Franklin. ""All I know is he saw death,"" Franklin told CNN. ""Maybe they [the Army] should have helped him a little more,"" said Franklin, adding he was not blaming the military for the incident. Quinones might not have received sufficient individual treatment after returning from Iraq, Franklin said. Quinones worked at one of Fort Stewart's post-exchange stores. the neighbor said, adding he didn't believe Quinones had been treated at Winn Army Community Hospital, scene of Monday's hostage situation. The hostage incident started at about 4 a.m. Monday when the former Army serviceman entered the facility and demanded care, spokesman Kevin Larson said Monday. Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Phillips, a senior Fort Stewart commander, told the Associated Press the former soldier told hostages he needed help for mental problems ""connected, I'm quite certain, to his past service."" The gunman immediately took one hostage and went to the third floor, which houses the behavioral health unit, where he held two more people at gunpoint, including a nurse practitioner, Larson said. The nurse, an Army major, was able to calm the man and authorities started negotiations, Larson said. The gunman  eventually surrendered and was taken into custody for questioning, he said. Quinones was armed with an MP5 assault rifle, an AR-15 assault rifle, a 9 millimeter handgun and a .38-caliber pistol, according to the affidavit. It accuses the gunman of pointing a firearm at an Army negotiator. Quinones' attorney, Karl Christian Zipperer, said late Tuesday afternoon he had just gotten the case and would have no comment.  A phone number for Quinones in Hinesville was disconnected. The suspect's initial appearance is scheduled for Wednesday before a U.S. magistrate judge in Savannah, the FBI said in a statement. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Robert A. Quinones had done two tours in Iraq, his neighbor says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The son of slain Gov. Salman Taseer was kidnapped Friday afternoon in a wealthy neighborhood in the city of Lahore, police said. Shahbaz Taseer was abducted from his car as he was on the way to his office, senior police official Abdul Razaq Cheema told reporters. Lahore police chief Ahmad Raza Tahir, appearing on Pakistani television, told reporters that a squad of 16 security personnel had been provided to Taseer for protection, as he had earlier reported receiving a series of anonymous threats. However, a provincial minister told reporters that the security detail was not with Taseer during the kidnapping. He said four armed men abducted Taseer in the Gulberg neighborhood, blocking his car with a motorcycle and a four-wheel drive vehicle. Taseer ran several family businesses after the death of his father. Salman Taseer was a renowned businessman and governor of Punjab province who was assassinated by one of his own security guards earlier this year. Police say bodyguard Mumtaz Qadri confessed to gunning down Taseer because of the governor was critical of the country's blasphemy law.

"(CNN) -- A newly discovered version of recordings made aboard Air Force One in the wake of President John F. Kennedy's assassination is being offered for sale at $500,000, the dealer selling the tape said Tuesday. This version has never before been heard by the public, Raab Collection Vice President Nathan Raab told CNN. ""It's exciting when you find something that's not only an antique but contributes to the historical record,"" Raab said. The Raab Collection, a historic documents dealer in Philadelphia, said in a statement the recording is more than 30 minutes longer than the version at the National Archives and contains the names of people never before heard from in the aftermath of Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. The Raab Collection is selling the reel-to-reel recording for $500,000, but is providing a digital file at no cost to the National Archives and the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. The tape was purchased by the Raab Collection in the public sale of the estate of Army Gen. Chester ""Ted"" Clifton, Jr., who served as the senior military aide to Kennedy and then to President Lyndon B. Johnson. An image of the label on the tape's box, shown on the Raab Collection website, says ""Radio Traffic involving AF-1 in flight from Dallas, Texas to Andrews AFB on November 22, 1963."" ""For General Clifton,"" the label says. It says it was made by the White House Communications Agency. At the time it was purchased, it was just a tape in a box, Nathan Raab said, but employees felt there was something more to it. They had the tape digitized and analyzed and compared it to transcripts from the time of assassination. ""This is a subject that has been extensively studied and there's no shortage of information on this tape,"" Raab said. A comparison of published works about the day of the assassination and previously known audio recordings from that day helped the company determine the true identity of the recording.","Kennedy was shot and killed as he rode in a motorcade in Dallas .

"(CNN) -- A series of anti-terror raids helped foil an assassination attempt on the Indonesian president by militants, the national police chief said Friday. ""Based from our investigation and the confessions of arrested terrorist suspects, we know that their target was to assassinate the president (Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono) and other high-ranking state officials and guests,"" said Chief Bambang Danuri, the indonesian police chief. Indonesian police conducted a series of raids in recent months on groups suspected of having ties to al Qaeda Aceh, a militant Islamic organization that has operated a training camp in the majority-Muslim Indonesian province of Aceh. Police have killed 13 suspected terrorists and arrested 71 others since February, and have confiscated scores of weapons and ammunition for AK-47s and M-16 rifles. Al Qaeda Aceh is an offshoot of Jemaah Islamiyah, the group behind the deadly 2002 bomb attacks on Bali and a pair of 2009 bombings at Western hotels in Jakarta. Police also learned that a recently-raided militant camp had been headed by Dulmatin, the suspected terrorist behind the Bali bombings who was killed by Indonesian police in March.

"(CNN) -- Fighting in northern Yemen has moved into Saudi Arabia, forcing school closures and sending thousands fleeing, according to the United Nations. ""Fighting has now spilled into Saudi Arabia, reportedly causing 240 villages to be evacuated and more than 50 schools to be closed, "" Sigrid Kaag of UNICEF said in a statement this week. ""The total number of people displaced by the conflict since 2004 has gone up to more than 175,000, from an estimated 150,000 only a few weeks ago."" Battles between Yemeni forces and Shiite Houthi rebels have raged intermittently for five years. A government offensive launched this summer has caused more bloodshed. The conflict is considered to be both separatist -- over who will assert authority in the area -- and sectarian -- whether Shiite Islam will dominate in majority Sunni Yemen. The rebels are supporters of slain Shiite cleric Hussein al-Houthi. As the fighting escalates, the situation is worsening for children, Kaag said. ""During the past three months, children affected by the conflict in the north have seen all their basic rights violated. Lack of safe water, nutrition and hygiene is exerting a heavy toll on their health and well-being, and threatening their very survival,"" Kaag said.

"(CNN) -- The company that was laying cable before an explosion last week at a popular Kansas City, Missouri, restaurant -- a blast that killed one person and injured at least 15 others -- did not have a permit for the excavation, a city official said Monday. Those who fail to have such a permit could face a $500 fine and up to six months in jail, Assistant City Manager Patrick Klein said. The contractor, Heartland Midwest, previously had worked in Kansas City after obtaining proper permits, according to Klein. But he said the company did not do so last Tuesday, when one of their employees laying fiber optic cable hit a 2-inch gas line with an underground boring machine. The explosion occurred about an hour later, just after 6 p.m. CT (7 p.m. ET). Officials: Contractor for cable company hit gas line . Authorities do not know what caused the leaking gas to ignite, according to Rob Hack, chief operating officer of Missouri Gas Energy. ""But all the damage points to ignition inside the restaurant,"" he said, referring to JJ's restaurant, a popular place near Country Club Plaza, an area filled with upscale shops and restaurants. The contractor called 911 shortly before 5 p.m. to report the gas-line incident, according to Fire Chief Paul Berardi. Mayor Sly James said city firefighters responded to a call about the gas odor a short time later but left the scene after being told by the utility company that everything was under control. A Missouri Gas Energy employee showed up about 20 minutes after the initial call and, after some initial readings on gas-measuring devices, called for backup, Hack said. The utility's employees then went into businesses asking people to leave and brought in excavating equipment to try to vent the pipe, according to the Missouri Gas Energy official. But while JJ's restaurant closed early due to an evident natural gas smell, hostess Deidre Estes and other employees weren't in a rush to leave, unaware of the danger they were in. Then, ""Boom! And everything was black,"" Estes told CNN affiliate KCTV. ""... I saw the flames, and I was scared I was going to burn up. And then with all my might, I got this strength and lifted the rubble off."" The explosion had ripped off the restaurant's roof, sending flames a few stories high into the night sky. Afterward, debris -- including a destroyed backhoe belonging to the gas company -- was stacked 3- to 4-feet high where the restaurant once stood.

"(CNN) -- When U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated nearly 50 years ago, he left behind a nation stunned by grief and brimming with questions. After his death, people poured out their heartbreak in letters and telegrams to his widow, Jacqueline Kennedy. ""Letters to Jackie: Condolences from a Grieving Nation,"" a book by historian Ellen Fitzpatrick, highlights hundreds of the 1.5 million consolation letters sent to Jacqueline Kennedy. Young and old united in a grief that transcended racial, economic and political lines. Fitzpatrick combed through the archives of the JFK library to select about 250 condolence letters for the book. ""Dear Mrs. Kennedy,"" wrote 8-year-old Kevin Radell. ""I am very sorry your husband got shot. ... Know you should forgive your enemies, but it is hard to forgive Lee Oswald."" Oswald, the accused assassin, was fatally shot days later. ""It was terrifying,"" a now-grown Radell said of the president's death. ""It was just a convergence of emotions -- of fear, because he was such a protector of the nation and such a leader, and we all loved him. He was a fatherly figure."" Radell's sentiment years later is a common theme in the letters. ""One woman compared the assassination of President Kennedy with the crucifixion,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""She said that 'they killed our Lord and Father, and now they have killed our president and father.'"" Martha Ross, the daughter of a slave, wrote of the closeness she felt with the president and addressed his two children in her letter, saying their father was ""my friend."" ""You know even those people that didn't like him ... loved him,"" said Winston Lucky, Ross's grandson. ""He was a strong man. My grandmother, she always talked about that he was going to help set this country right."" One letter from a cabdriver ends with a question: ""Why, why I'm still asking myself why?"" the driver writes. A month after the president was shot in Dallas, Texas, on Nov. 22, 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy acknowledged the letters. ""All of you who have written to me know how much we loved him, and he would return that love,"" she said in December. Kennedy was president from 1961 to 1963. Jacqueline Kennedy died in 1994. At her funeral, her son summed her up in one sentence: ""Love of words, the bonds of home and family, and her spirit of adventure.""","1.5 million letters were sent to Jacqueline Kennedy after JFK's assassination .

"(CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf came to power in a bloodless military coup in 1999 when he was chief of Pakistan's army. He held power until the 2008 elections after which he resigned. Since then he has lived in self-imposed exile in London. In late 2010 he launched the All Pakistan Muslim League party with a view to running for office in 2013. Musharraf now says he plans to return to his home country sometime at the end of January. How did Musharraf establish himself as a player in Pakistani politics? Like most Muslims, Musharraf's family moved to Pakistan when British India was divided into India and Pakistan, and settled in Karachi. Musharraf's father was a career diplomat, which saw him spend his early childhood in Turkey due to his father's assignment in Ankara. But despite early family life in civil service, Musharraf decided on a different career path -- in 1964 he was commissioned second lieutenant in an artillery regiment in the Pakistani Army. His rise through the military would help cement his political power in Pakistan by gaining the backing of the country's armed forces. He was promoted to major general in 1991, appointed chief of army staff with rank of general in 1998, and then made chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the following year. How did Musharraf gain power in Pakistan? It was during his stint as the country's military chief that there was an opening for Musharraf's political ascendancy, when in 1999 the then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif dismissed him after the army's failed invasion in Kargil, in Indian-administered Kashmir. As Musharraf was returning from an overseas visit in October 1999, Sharif refused to allow the commercial airliner with 200 passengers on board to land. Within hours the army had deposed Sharif in a bloodless coup, and the plane was allowed to touch down with only 10 minutes of fuel left. In 2001 Musharraf appointed himself president of Pakistan while remaining the head of the army. Musharraf's rule: Strengthening his grip on power . In April 2002 a referendum allowed Musharraf to hold office for a further five years. Four months later, Musharraf implemented 29 amendments to the constitution, granting himself the power to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister. In a televised address in December 2004, Musharraf announced that he would not step down as top military leader, even though he had previously agreed to give up the position of the head of the army at the end of 2004. He said that he needed to maintain his position in order to watch over anti-terrorist operations. During his rule, Pakistan attained respectable growth rates and established a generally favorable investment climate. Along with that came a growing middle class, a more aggressive media, and a more assertive judiciary. ""He brought parliamentary reforms. He brought women into the parliament,"" said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, director of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency. But, analysts say, Musharraf never lost his military mindset. ""He in a way, always believed in a unity of command, a very centralized command, which means his command, in fact,"" said Lt. Gen. Talat Masood, a political analyst. Why did things turn sour for Musharraf? Musharraf's popularity began plummeting in 2007 after he suspended Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry for ""misuse of authority."" The move triggered protests and accusations that he was trying to influence the court's ruling on whether he could run for another five-year term. Chaudhry was reinstated but the damage was done. In October of that year, Musharraf was re-elected president by a parliament critics said was stacked with his supporters. Opposition parties filed a challenge. The next month, he declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge again and blacked out independent TV outlets. Under pressure from the West, Musharraf later lifted the emergency and promised elections in January 2008. He allowed Sharif, the prime minister he deposed, to return from exile. He also let in another political foe, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto who led the Pakistan People's Party. However, in December 2007, the country was plunged into further turmoil when Bhutto was assassinated. Bhutto had returned from a self-imposed, eight-year exile to run in the country's general elections two months before her assassination and already had escaped one attempt on her life. She was killed by a 15-year-old suicide bomber while campaigning in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi, the seat of the country's military. Musharraf's government and the CIA contend the killing was orchestrated by a group with ties to al Qaeda, but polls found that a majority of Pakistanis believe Musharraf's government was complicit. In 2010, further criticism of Musharraf emerged after the United Nations ruled that Bhutto's death could have been prevented had Musharraf's government taken adequate measures to protect her. Musharraf rejected the findings, saying that Bhutto had police protection and took unnecessary risks. Meanwhile, several other factors compounded Musharraf's declining popularity: a shortage of essential food items, power cuts, and skyrocketing inflation. In February 2008 Musharraf's party admitted defeat in parliamentary elections and he was succeeded by Asif Zardari, Bhutto's widower. The leaders of Pakistan's two main opposition parties formed a coalition and vowed to restore deposed judges. Six months later, the coalition moved to impeach Musharraf, who then resigned as president, though he said the allegations of misconduct were false. He went into self-imposed exile in London. In August 2009, Pakistan's supreme court found that Musharraf had violated the constitution in 2007 when he imposed a national state of emergency. Government officials said that if he returned, he'd be arrested. What now for Pakistan's former president? In May 2010 Musharraf announced on CNN that he planned to re-enter Pakistan politics and launched a new political party in October of that year. But a Pakistani court later issued an arrest warrant for him in connection to the assassination of Bhutto. Musharraf's legal adviser told CNN that the accusations were baseless. Musharraf now says he'll return to his country between January 27 and 30, despite word from authorities that he will be arrested when he does so. Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, a special public prosecutor in the assassination case, said a Rawalpindi court has already issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf. ""They are bound to execute the order unless a higher court sets aside the orders,"" Ali said, adding that Musharraf is accused of conspiring in the assassination. Musharraf announces he will return to Pakistan late this month . Musharraf's attorney, Chaudry Faisal, said the threat of arrest is politically motivated and has no legal bearing. The warrant is being challenged in court, the attorney said. He described the claim that Musharraf could be arrested at any time upon return as ""absurd."" Musharraf said that he will return even at the risk of his life. Speaking to CNN, the former president said he had declined to provide a specific date because of security concerns. He spoke about the possibility of arrest, but said he expects he will be fine, so long as ""the judiciary plays its just role, and there are no interruptions."" He described his support as scattered, and said he needs to build it again from the ground up. ""This is a do-or-die moment for me and my party. I need to muster all the support I can,"" he said. Musharraf pens exclusive op-ed for CNN.com . CNN's Reza Sayah and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this story.","Musharraf's rise through the military helped him cement his political power in Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- California public television icon Huell Howser has died, his longtime station said Monday, an announcement that set off a flood of heartfelt condolences from his fans in the Golden State and beyond. He was 67. The Tennessee native quietly retired in late November after 25 years in which he became a household name in his adopted state as host of ""California's Gold"" and other televised travelogues on KCET. He died Sunday night at his home in the Los Angeles area, said Ryan Morris of Huell Howser Productions. ""Huell elevated the simple joys and undiscovered nuggets of living in our great state,"" KCET said in a statement. ""... Most importantly, he reminded us to find the magic and wonderment in our lives every day."" Howser grew up in Tennessee, graduated from the University of Tennessee, worked on a U.S. senator's staff and served in the U.S. Marine Corps, according to a biography posted on his company website. He then launched his television career at WSM in Nashville. He moved on to a job hosting a magazine-style TV series at WCBS in New York before landing in Los Angeles in 1981 as a reporter for KCBS. Six years later, Howser joined forces with KCET, a public television station, to produce a program known as ""Videolog"" showcasing the stories of all types of people. That led to ""California's Gold"" and six other series about life in the Golden State, including ""Visiting with Huell Howser,"" ""Road Trip with Huell Howser,"" ""California's Golden Parks,"" ""California's Green,"" ""California's Water"" and ""Downtown."" In addition to California, his shows could be seen in Oregon, Nevada and Tennessee. Less than 20 minutes after KCET posted news of Howser's death on its Facebook page, more than 150 fans had posted responses mourning his loss and remembering his impact on California and their lives. They remembered him as ""amazing,"" a ""favorite"" and ""one-of-a-kind talent"" who also possessed a ""kind curiosity."" One man said that news of Howser's death ""brought tears to my eyes like I lost a friend,"" and another remarked that ""Sunday evenings will not be the same.""

"(CNN) -- A former soldier arrested after a hostage incident at a Georgia military base is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. Robert Anthony Quinones, 29, of Hinesville, Georgia, will appear before a U.S. magistrate judge in Savannah, Georgia, on multiple charges, including threats to kill President Obama and former President Bill Clinton. Quinones was arrested Monday after a two-hour hostage situation at Winn Army Community Hospital on Fort Stewart, about 45 miles from Savannah, according to the FBI. Officials said he had demanded mental health care at the hospital. Quinones is charged with assault of a federal officer and kidnapping in the incident, which ended with the gunman's surrender. No one was injured in the incident, officials said. After he was taken into custody and during interviews, Quinones ""expressed his plans, preparation and intentions to kill President Obama and former President Clinton,"" according to an affidavit filed in federal court. ""Quinones detailed his studies of Secret Service protocols, sniper techniques and means of disguise and weapons concealment to implement his assassination plans."" A search of his residence resulted in the discovery of 11 long guns, four pistols, multiple rounds of ammunition and dozens of bayonets and knives, according to the affidavit. Authorities also found books and manuals about FBI hostage rescue teams, Osama bin Laden, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, the Russian mafia and other topics, according to the affidavit signed by FBI and secret service agents. When asked whether he would kill Obama or Clinton if given a chance, Quinones said, ""Yes. On a scale of 1 to 10 about being serious, I am a 10,"" the affidavit said. Quinones was discharged from the military in February and had a civilian job at Fort Stewart, said the FBI, which released no other information on his military record. Neighbor Jerry Franklin said he has known Quinones for several years. ""He was a good kid,"" he said. Franklin, 48, an Army retiree, said Quinones would talk with him and other veterans because they understood the stress brought on by combat. Quinones had served two tours in Iraq, Franklin said. ""All I know is he saw death,"" Franklin told CNN. ""Maybe they [the Army] should have helped him a little more,"" said Franklin, adding he was not blaming the military for the incident. Quinones might not have received sufficient individual treatment after returning from Iraq, Franklin said. Quinones worked at one of Fort Stewart's post-exchange stores, the neighbor said, adding he didn't believe Quinones had been treated at Winn Army Community Hospital, the scene of Monday's hostage situation. The hostage incident started about 4 a.m. Monday when the former Army serviceman entered the facility and demanded care, spokesman Kevin Larson said Monday. The gunman immediately took one hostage and went to the third floor, which houses the behavioral health unit, where he held two more people at gunpoint, including a nurse practitioner, Larson said. The nurse, an Army major, was able to calm the man and authorities started negotiations, Larson said. The gunman eventually surrendered and was taken into custody for questioning, he said. Quinones was armed with an MP5 assault rifle, an AR-15 assault rifle, a 9 mm handgun and a .38-caliber pistol, according to the affidavit. It accuses the gunman of pointing a firearm at an Army negotiator. Quinones' attorney, Karl Christian Zipperer, said late Tuesday afternoon he had just gotten the case and would have no comment. A phone number for Quinones in Hinesville was disconnected. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Robert A. Quinones has served two tours in Iraq, his neighbor says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Far from clarifying matters, the Pakistani Supreme Court's guilty verdict against Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has added several layers of uncertainty about the fate of Pakistan's civilian government and its longest serving prime minister. Moments after Gilani was found guilty of contempt for his refusal to revive old corruption charges against President Asif Ali Zardari, politicians and political analysts on dozens of Pakistan's 24-hour news networks offered a dizzying array of contrasting views on what the ruling meant. ""It plunges the country into political and legal crisis,"" said Najam Sethi, editor of the English language political weekly, The Friday Times. Pakistan's Gilani convicted of contempt . ""In practical and legal terms it does not mean much,"" said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, the head of an Islamabad based political think tank. ""A lot of people were under the impression that the prime minister would be disqualified, but he is not."" For now, Gilani remains Pakistan's prime minister and the new debate raging here is whether his conviction justifies a disqualification and his removal from the post. Within hours of the verdict Gilani's lawyer, Aitzaz Ahsan, held a press conference and cited Pakistan's constitution, which says a member of parliament can only be disqualified after a conviction and a prison sentence of at least two years. The Supreme Court did not sentence Gilani to time behind bars but delivered a symbolic sentence by keeping him in custody for the duration of the hearing which lasted only several minutes. Therefore, ""there is no automatic immediate disqualification,"" Ahsan said. ""The prime minister is not disqualified."" Gilani's eligibility to remain Pakistan's prime minister will be decided by the speaker of parliament, and possibly the election commission, in a process that could take months. But Gilani's political enemies are already calling for him to step down and no one's screaming louder than Nawaz Sharif, a former premier who would love nothing more than to reclaim the post following next year's parliamentary elections. ""I think that after the conviction the PM should immediately step down from his post,"" Sharif told a reporters in a live news conference following Thursday's verdict. ""This is a convicted prime minister. He has been found guilty, he has been sentenced by the Supreme Court."" Sethi said Sharif could decide to take the drastic measure of quitting parliament in protest if the prime minister refuses to resign, a move that would place the legitimacy of parliament in jeopardy and fuel a fresh political crisis. The contempt case against Gilani stemmed from his refusal to ask Swiss authorities to reopen old corruption charges against President Zardari. The charges date back to the 1990s when Zardari allegedly laundered tens of millions of dollars while his wife, Benazir Bhutto, served as prime minister. Mehboob said the verdict failed to answer central questions about Zardari. ""It has diverted attention from the real issue,"" he said. ""The real issue is if our president is guilty of amassing illegitimate wealth and money laundering. We have failed to arrive at any conclusion and we're still perceived as a nation that doesn't abide by the rule of law."" Even so, Mehboob said the political drama is likely to continue, taking up precious time and resources in a country that is facing a myriad of crises including widespread poverty, a broken economy and the bloody fight against Islamist militants. ""This is just a waste of the nation's time,"" said businessman Abdul Rauf. ""It's just very disappointing.""","Pakistan's PM found guilty of contempt for refusal to revive corruption charges against President .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A Chinese television station has apologized for Monday's massive fire at an unoccupied luxury hotel that killed a firefighter and wounded seven other people. Police suspect fireworks to be the cause of the blaze at the 40-story Mandarin Oriental. Central China Television (CCTV) said in its apology that staffers who were overseeing the construction of a new television complex in central Beijing hired people to set off large firecrackers outside the building without prior approval. The resulting fire engulfed the newly constructed 40-story Mandarin Oriental, located next door. One firefighter died of smoke inhalation, Beijing officials said Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- The number of birth defects in China are on the rise and the rate has nearly doubled in the past decade in Beijing and several provinces, a state-run newspaper reported Tuesday. The increase is mainly due to improved diagnostic techniques and monitoring capability, as well as women waiting until they are older to have children, China Daily reported, citing the Beijing municipal health bureau. Environmental pollution could also be a factor, the newspaper said, quoting Caijing magazine. The rate of birth defects in Beijing last year was 170 per 10,000 births, nearly twice the rate in 1997, when it was 90 birth defects per 10,000 births, China Daily reported, using figures from the health bureau. The most common birth defects in Beijing's Shunyi district are congenital heart disease, excessive fingers or toes, cleft lip or palate, and neural tube defects, a regional reproductive health officer told China Daily.

"(CNN) -- A court in China's Yunnan Province on Wednesday rejected an appeal from six defendants convicted of killing 13 Chinese sailors, said the state-run Xinhua news agency. Last month, the Intermediate People's Court of Kunming sentenced four of the men to death for the killings, which occurred in October 2011 on the Mekong River. They were also ordered to pay compensation of 6 million yuan (about $960,000). Read more: Chinese court sentences drug gang to death over river murders . One of the men is a drug lord identified as Naw Kham; the other three were members of his gang, Xinhua said. Of the two other gang members, one received a death sentence with a reprieve and another was sentenced to eight years in prison. Thai authorities discovered the murder scene after boarding two Chinese cargo ships that had come under gunfire. They found nearly 1 million amphetamines and the 12 bodies, some with their hands bound. One sailor was missing. The men had been charged with homicide, hijacking, kidnapping and drug trafficking. The alleged gang was arrested in a joint operation by police from China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, according to the state-run China Daily. Five of the six men are from Myanmar, Thailand and Laos; one is stateless, Xinhua said. Naw Kham's gang colluded with Thai soldiers in the attack on the cargo ships, the Hua Ping and Yu Xing 8, Xinhua said. Naw Kham had also directed several of his subordinates in the kidnapping of Chinese sailors and hijacking of cargo ships in exchange for ransom in early April 2011, the court said.

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Microsoft unveiled Windows 8 for public testing on Wednesday in the hope that it will help the brand win back some of the ground it has been losing to Apple and Google. The new operating system works on tablets as well as PCs and laptops, connecting them via the cloud to give users a more consistent experience as they switch between devices. ""It's beautiful, modern, fast and fluid -- it's a generational change in the Windows operating system,"" Microsoft Windows President Steven Sinofsky said as he launched the consumer preview of the new operating system at Mobile World Congress, in Barcelona, Spain. Read more: Google, the star of the show? Windows 8 scales across devices and screen sizes, Sinofsky said. ""There's too many hard stops between phones and tablets and desktops. We want to make things more harmonious,"" he said. The new operating system uses the ""Metro"" style of software currently being used on phones running the Windows 7 operating system, using tiles on the start-up screen. A new Windows Store, which will be the marketplace for all apps for Windows 8, also launched on Wednesday. Apps will be free to download for the duration of the consumer preview. James Governor, a London-based tech-industry analyst, said Windows 8 was unlikely to galvanize Microsoft's market profile but its entry into tablet technology laid crucial groundwork for sustained relevance. He said the popularity of Windows 7 meant that, as was seen with Microsoft's earlier XP operating system, there wouldn't be intense clamoring for an immediate update. ""I don't think it's an explosive 'Christ, we've got to have this new release,' ""he said. ""There isn't necessarily a pent-up demand for what Windows 8 represents.""

""Microsoft needs to be in the tablet game. It couldn't sit out two or three rounds of tablets without trying to have a more effective play and clearly Windows 8 is a big part of that,"" he said. In terms of functionality, Governor said Windows 8 suffered from a ""weird two-personality thing"" as it switched between its user-friendly new Metro interface into functional areas of computing. ""A lot of people aren't going to be comfortable with that: here is this new Metro personality and then, oh by the way, now I really want some really hardcore web development.

""By supporting the Global Fund, we can help to change the fortunes of the poorest countries in the world,"" Gates said in a statement. ""I can't think of more important work."" At a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gates said the funds could be used immediately to ""saves lives, whether it is bed nets (to protect against mosquitoes carrying malaria) or TB (tuberculosis) treatment, those are two diseases that don't get perhaps the visibility of the work done in HIV but they are every bit as important."" The investment comes on top of $650 million the Gates Foundation has already contributed since the Global Fund was launched 10 years ago. The fund has been under scrutiny after controversy over the possible misuse of funds. Dr. Michel Kazatchkine, executive director of the fund, said Tuesday he would resign in March after leading the organization for five years. Kazatchkine cited the fund's decision to appoint a general manager as part of its ""ambitions transformation plan"" as the reason for his departure. Speaking to journalists with Simon Bland, the Global Fund's chair, Gates downplayed the controversy. The way it had been written about was ""pretty disappointing,"" he said. ""If you are going to do health programs in Africa, you are going to have some percentage that is misused."" ""The interest is saving lives,"" Gates said, adding there were ""all sorts of things that are going on that far overwhelm any amount of misdirection or whatever it was.""","NEW: The Gates Foundation has already contributed $650 million to the Global Fund .

"(CNN) -- One of the world's largest private superyachts is the latest to set sail on an expedition to uncover the secrets of a British battle cruiser lost during World War II. Octopus -- a 414 foot megayacht -- was donated to the British Navy by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft. Allen will fund the recovery and research expedition, sparing the British government any cost. A previous expedition by Blue Water Recoveries, a deep sea shipwreck recovery company, located the wreck 11 years ago. The enduring allure of tall ships . This week the recovery team will return to the wreck site with a two-fold mission: Retrieve the ship's bell and document the remains of the battle cruiser in the hopes of later determining what happened in the Hood's final moments. David Mearns, director of Blue Water Recoveries, said the ship's bell was ""lovingly looked after"" by the crew. Its recovery is seen by those who lost loved ones as a way to commemorate those who died. From the archive: Divers find wreck of HMS Hood . The HMS Hood was sunk during a battle in the North Atlantic with German battleship Bismarck in 1941. The Hood remains the largest Royal Navy vessel to have gone down, and resulted in the largest loss of life suffered by any single warship in British history. The wreck of HMS Hood is designated under the Protection of the Military Remains Act, meaning the recovery team had to seek permission from the British Navy in order to retrieve the bell. The mission was agreed to by the British Government, and the Ministry of Defence say the bell -- if recovered -- will form a tangible and fitting memorial to the ship and the 1,415 men who died when she sunk in the North Atlantic. Mearns recalls the astonishment of the team when they located the ship's bell, on their first dive, in 2001. ""There was just a miscellaneous pile of twisted and torn metal... most of it was very angled steel but there was this curved shape,"" Mearns remembers. ""We pushed in on the camera and, lo and behold, there was the bell sitting basically unattached, not connected to the ship [and] all by itself on its side."" The team, Mearns recalls, ""were just stunned by it."" The 40,000 ton wreck is strewn over two and half kilometers of seabed, and uncovering the bell was a stroke of luck for the recovery team. ""It's a really iconic item and personal symbol of the ship, but we were there conducting this investigation on a 'don't touch' basis. It never occurred to us, even for a second, 'What if we recovered the bell? Should we attempt to?'"" Mearns tells CNN. By the time Mearns and his team had returned to land, news of the bell's discovery had broken. A public debate had erupted over the ethics of disturbing a wreck where so many lives had been lost. Mearns gained the support of the HMS Hood Association -- whose members include veterans and relatives of those who died -- before seeking financial support to return and recover the bell. The association's president, rear admiral Philip Wilcocks, said in statement on the mission: ""There is no headstone among the flowers for those who perish at sea."" Wilcocks added, ""future generations will be able to gaze upon [the Hood's] bell and remember with gratitude and thanks the heroism, courage and personal sacrifice of Hood's ship's company who died in the service of their country."" Read more: Scouring sea for sunken treasures is big business . If recovered, the bell will go on display in 2014, at an exhibition at the Royal Navy Museum in the southern English port of Portsmouth -- where the Hood was based. Mearns says: ""It's been out there as a wish of the association to do this and I've just been looking for the right sponsor to do it in the right way and to get the permission to do it. ""I'd been working with Vulcan, Paul Allen's company, and it just so happened we could combine the availability of Octopus in the region at the right time, because you can only really work in this area two months of the year."" The Octopus, the world's 13th largest megayacht, is a ""fantastically capable vessel,"" Mearns says. Read more: World's oldest warship to get $25m facelift . Despite being classified as a yacht, the Octopus carries equipment including a deepwater diving ROV [remotely operated vehicle] and survey and navigation equipment. The Octopus, says Mearns, ""is very qualified"" for the job. The British Royal Navy has asked the team to place an ensign on the site of the wreck, Mearns added. The mission also hopes to shed light on the final moments of the battle cruiser, which broke in two during the attack. It was under sustained fire from the Bismarck, but its own ammunition also exploded. The cause of its sinking has never been clarified. ""I think we are going to make a real improvement in the imagery and information that we bring back from the wreck to allow naval architects to look at and come to some firm conclusions about the damage,"" Mearns added. ""This isn't just a trophy hunt to go get the bell.""

"(CNN) -- The buzzword in gaming at Mobile World Congress was definitely ""quad-core,"" and that's likely to become an even hotter topic when Apple is expected to unveil its iPad 3 device next week in San Francisco. Game developers are pushing the very concept of portable gaming on tablets and smartphones at a breakneck rate thanks to quad-core processors such as NVIDIA's Tegra 3. ""Quad-core processors offer much faster performance for graphics-intensive activities such as high-definition video playback and high-end gaming as well as enabling the phone to handle multitasking with less effect on the user experience,"" said Daniel Gleeson, a research analyst for IHS Screen Digest. ""This will make the smartphone a more compelling consumer experience, delivering PC-like performance. It also will increase the disruption that high-end smartphones will cause to adjacent products, such as handheld games consoles."" Microsoft exec: Quad-core arms race is 'ridiculous' While Sony holds the lead in deep, portable gaming for those who pick up the PlayStation Vita device, game experiences for smartphones and tablets are quickly becoming more immersive. And at the moment, quad-core technology is the reason for that. Of course, Moore's Law will catapult portable devices forward quickly. Tegra 4 is already on the horizon. ""These games didn't come to Tegra 3 by accident,"" said Hassan Anjum, Tegra campaign managerÂ at NVIDIA. ""We've been working with these leading mobile game developers for over six years to hone and refine their wares. Tegra 3, with four performance processing cores, in addition to its fifth battery saver core, and a 12-core GeForce GPU, is putting console games on notice."" Here are five quad-core games showcased at the mobile tech event in Barcelona, Spain, that are worth looking out for when they go mobile later this year. These games already look console-quality. And they can even be played with a traditional game controller on an HDTV when you're not on the go. ""Hamilton's Great Adventure THD"" (FatShark) -- It's perhaps the best example of a console-quality game gone portable since this literally started as a downloadable PC and PlayStation 3 cooperative puzzle game. Players control adventurer Ernest Hamilton and his bird Sasha (separately offline on one tablet) as they explore 60 levels filled with puzzles. What's most impressive about this nice blend of action and mazes are the visuals, which bring an assortment of rich interactive environments such as jungles and deserts to life in 3-D. ""Dark Kingdom THD"" (GOGN Entertainment) -- Action role-playing games have defined console gaming from the early days. Developed in South Korea, this game promises a rich experience that will immerse players for days and weeks. Players assume the role of King Keizelic's son and embark on an epic quest to find the lost leader. Along the way, gamers will battle huge bosses in settings that feature destructible environments. Of course, like any good role-playing game, players can hone their character through upgrade by collecting spirit and rune stones. The visually impressive game comes to life through technology such as PhysX destructible objects and gorgeous water effects. ""Golden Arrow THD"" (November Software) -- This game is your traditional hack-and-slash fantasy action game. The title harkens back to the old Sega Genesis game, ""Golden Axe,"" although this is a completely original title. ""Golden Arrow"" lets players join up and take on assorted enemies together as they traverse landscapes ripe with cutting-edge special effects. The developer is making this game a showcase for tablets, from the intuitive touch controls to the high-end features such as high dynamic range lighting, lens flares, enhanced explosions and fire effects. What all of this translates to is a mobile experience that looks beautiful, although the frenetic pace of weapons-clashing won't leave much time for sightseeing. There's also head-to-head gameplay for added replay value. ""Eden to GREEEEN"" (iNiS) -- First there was ""Plants vs. Zombies."" Now the foliage is taking on alien monster trucks. In this colorful action strategy game from developer iNiS, players will battle an assortment of four-wheeled machines that have invaded Eden. Running on Unreal Engine 3, the same technology that powers Epic Games' ""Gears of War 3"" on Xbox 360, this game makes use of visual effects such as explosions, smoke, fire and real-time cloud shadows to bring Eden to life. The action is fast and furious as players control assorted flowers and foliage against attacking machines, which are after the Euphoria that breathes life into the planet. Going green has never been so addictive. ""Zombie Driver THD"" (Exor Studios) -- Zombies remain a hot genre for gaming, and this overhead-perspective horror game puts players behind the wheel of one of 13 different vehicles, including a firetruck and a bulldozer. These modes of transport can be upgraded with everything from flamethrowers to mini-guns. While mowing down the undead is part of the gameplay, other objectives include rescuing people who hide throughout the virtual world, transporting cargo and defending targets. Giant mutant bosses spice things up in this fast-paced arcade game, which features a dynamic combo system. This game looks as good as its PC predecessor thanks to all the Tegra 3 bells and whistles. PhysX brings the destruction to life in an assortment of challenging modes, including a 31-mission Story mode and an arena-based Slaughter mode.","""Hamilton's Great Adventure THD"" is example of a console-quality game gone portable .

"(CNN) -- One of Myanmar's vice presidents has resigned from his post due to health reasons, the government said Wednesday. First Vice President U Tin Aung Myint Oo submitted his resignation July 1. A statement read in Myanmar's parliament said the vice president was seeking extended medical treatment in Singapore because his condition is not improving. The government did not say what his illness is. According to the law, a new vice president will be chosen by the 25% of parliament that is made up of members of the military, because the position is a quota reserved for them. That vote is scheduled for July 10. The second vice president of Myanmar is Sai Mauk Kham. Myanmar has seen dramatic changes over the past year. In May, Democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi and 33 other newly elected members of her National League for Democracy party took their seats in parliament, a leap in the country's progress toward democracy. Myanmar's legislature has 664 seats, more than 80% of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military-backed ruling group, the Union Solidarity and Development Party. The government has also pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, begun negotiations with ethnic rebel groups and embarked on a series of economic reforms. Those steps have been welcomed by the United States, the European Union and other governments, who have responded by easing sanctions against Myanmar, also known as Burma. But international officials have also cautioned that the country still has a long way to go.","Myanmar's first vice president resigns for health reasons .

"(CNN) -- Can anyone out there tell me how many times during this presidential election cycle the term ""double-down"" has been used? My old-school hash mark technique is thoroughly inadequate to keep up with the count. It seems that not a day goes by without my hearing or reading, sometimes multiple times, the term ""double-down."" One side or the other side makes a crazy statement and we wait for an ""apology,"" for someone to say I did not have all the information or I made a mistake or I should never have said that. Do we get it? We get doubling-down. We get Mitt Romney and Republican surrogates holding firm and ""doubling-down"" on factually flawed statements about the tragedy in Libya. We get them ""doubling down"" on bizarre comments about 47% of Americans feeling entitled. No apologies. Just doubling down. When I first noticed this term, I thought OK, they are standing firm -- with emphasis. It did not seem a bad term, especially when used as a matter of one's convictions, a confident playing of the hand one has been dealt. After all, being flaky or bending with every wind is not a good thing. But we are talking about leadership here! The leadership of a country, of a free people, of a complex, critical and changing world. How does ""double-down"" fit in these contexts? Opinion: The true difference between Obama, Romney . Firm, principled and resolute leaders are fine. But we also like our leaders to be human -- flaws and all-- self-aware in their imperfections. They are more trustworthy that way. Jonathan Lloyd wrote an article late last year for the NBC Los Angeles website entitled ""Famous Apologies or Nonapologies."" The top 10 in recent times, according to Lloyd, include Bill Clinton, 1998; Jimmy Swaggart, 1998; Olympian Marion Jones, 2007; Sen. Larry Craig, 2007; Gov. Eliot Spitzer, 2008; and Tiger Woods, 2010, among others. If you are breathing, you should have listened to or heard of one or more of these apologies and know how you reacted to them. While you may not agree with the list, you must agree they were pretty famous ""please forgive me's."" Some were from leaders; some worked and some did not. But they all were an attempt to close the circle on a transgression and regain trust, something we expect of a well-raised child. And a responsible adult. Which brings me to what my Mama and Daddy taught me: ""When you mess up fess up."" Tell the truth and tell them before they find out. They taught me that punishment would not go away, but would be far less severe if I told the truth about what happened and how or why I veered off the charted course. My parents believed in corporal punishment, so I got the message with great clarity. From where does this new notion of doubling-down come? Anyone who doubles-down on what everyone knows (or will soon find out to be) ill-informed, offensive or untenable positions, is either a fool or believes everyone else is. Further, what kind of leader molds himself or herself in perfection and cements his or her thinking into antiquity? A few years ago Linda Stamato wrote an article for the Ivey Business Journal entitled: ""Should Business Leaders Apologize? Why, When, and How an Apology Matters."" One quote from the piece is most appropriate during this election season: . ""Questions of timing are critical. The longer it takes a business leader or a section manager, for example, to acknowledge his or her mistake, the more likely the undecided folks will turn against him or her. Business leaders need to understand that if, in the end, it is going to be disclosed that they have erred, it's better to own up as quickly as possible in order to have a hand in making repairs. ""To acknowledge a mistake is to assert secure leadership; to take responsibility and prescribe a corrective course of action is wise management. Taking responsibility for an error earns the privilege of being forgiven, and thus granted a second chance."" Opinion: How Romney really feels about Republicans . Here are some other takes on the issue that our politicians might do well to read. Erika Andersen's article for Forbes Magazine entitiled ""Courageous Leaders Don't Make Excuses ... They Apologize."" And for the one-minute manager fans, Tom Peters has a segment on YouTube called ""Leadership: The Power of the Apology,"" in which he encourages us to become students of apology. He says, ""Learning how to apologize effectively is the real essence of strategic strength."" Let's reposition the notion of apology and give it the significance in our political discourse it rightly deserves. Apology must not become a dirty word. The ability to apologize is a sign of leadership strength, not weakness. It communicates humility and acknowledges the value of others. It is a skill to be studied, an art to be mastered. It heals and strengthens individuals, communities and nations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marsha Sampson Johnson.","Marsha Johnson: This election season, it seems like politicians are continually ""doubling-down""
She says this term is meant to seem strong, but just avoids fessing up .
She says we like strong leaders, but want them to be self-aware; it's not weak to admit flaws .
Johnson: The longer a leader takes to admit flaw, the more some will turn against them ."
"(CNN) -- There are a myriad of options and over 50 years of heritage to tackle in the unenviable quest to isolate the greatest James Bond scene of all time. Six actors have played Britain's silver-tongued spy who thrives in a world crawling with agents, double agents, assassins and femme fatales. Over the course of 23 films, that have grossed over $6 billion, there have been a litany of memorable set pieces as Bond pitches battle against maniacal villains, hell bent on world domination. Despite this wealth of choice, a series of Bond experts, and one of the film's legendary producers, are in no doubt as to which scene should be anointed the best ever. And given the recurring role that skiing has played throughout the life of Bond, it should comes as no surprise our panel's chosen encounter occurs on the slopes. ""I would argue the most iconic sequence is in 'The Spy Who Loved Me', when Bond shot straight off the edge of a cliff at Baffin Island in Canada,"" Ajay Chowdhury, editor of the James Bond International Fan Club, told CNN. ""We saw him fall and fall, and when the Union Jack parachute opened up and the theme tune kicked in, the world cheered. ""That was Britain's Queen Elizabeth's Jubilee Year in 1977 and I think to this day it was (famous Bond producer) Albert 'Cubby' Broccoli's favorite ever scene in a Bond movie. ""When everything cleared it was him, on his own against the world. You play that sequence around the world and it is James Bond. And he did it on skis."" Screen icon . The opening scene in any Bond film is a guaranteed thrill ride, but the beginning of ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" the tenth film in the franchise, is still hard to top even in today's world of daredevil stunts and breathtaking computer-generated imagery. It also encapsulates the qualities that make Bond such an enduring screen icon. The international man of mystery leaves a love interest in a remote log cabin up in the Alps after a message is sent to his new-fangled watch telling him to patch in to MI6. Bond then outwits a series of gun-wielding Russian henchmen, before soaring off a cliff on his skis, plunging thousands of feet in the air before releasing his parachute, bedecked in the colors of the Union Jack. Vic Armstrong has a Bond pedigree almost as impressive as either Sean Connery or Roger Moore. His legacy stretches over half a century, working first as a stuntman, then a stunt co-ordinator. And even though he has been involved in, and devised, some of its finest sequences, he agrees the best stunt ever features in one of the few films he didn't work on. ""For me the greatest stunt is when Bond skis off the cliff with the Union Jack parachute, to me that is sensational,"" he told CNN. ""I saw that and the whole cinema erupted. I thought that was the most fantastic opening ever -- just brilliant."" Lone wolf . ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" is not the only iconic scene to see Bond shaken and stirred on the slopes. Ian Fleming, author of the original James Bond novels, passed his love for skiing on to his subject, and it has made regular appearances in some of 23 films that have followed since ""Dr. No"" showcased Connery as the dashing agent in 1962. ""For Your Eyes Only"" includes a daring ski chase in which Moore's Bond escapes his pursuers by zipping down a bobsleigh run while George Lazenby, in his only appearance as 007, even manages to evade capture in a downhill chase despite being down to one ski in ""Her Majesty's Secret Service."" Timothy Dalton's Bond in ""Living Daylights"" swept down a mountain slope on a cello case to escape danger while Pierce Brosnan battled grenade-throwing baddies on skidoo's in ""The World is Not Enough."" Given that skiing is a high-octane preserve of the lone wolf, often associated with glamorous and sophisticated circles, it is inconceivable Britain's premier spy would be be at a loss on the slopes. ""The generation of people who inspired the generation Ian Fleming was in all divided their time between skiing, mountain climbing, writing poems and fighting in the First World War,"" said comedian and Bond enthusiast Rob Deering. ""Bond has got the skills written into his hard drive because he's British. He can drive cranes, cars, submarines, why wouldn't he be able to drive two sticks? ""If you are going to live the high life you've got to ski. It's action packed, it's classy, it's quintessential Bond."" Thrill seeker . As well as skiing, the other sports Bond pursues are also individual ones -- 007 is as unlikely to be found participating in team sports as the dry Martini loving spy would be propping up the bar of a British pub drinking pints of ale. ""Bond plays golf, Bond scuba dives and he skis; those are his three sports of choice,"" said Chowdhury. ""They are all individual, they are not team games, they are slightly glamorous, and not something you can do on your local pitch. Skiing captures the danger, the thrill that Bond would push himself through."" So when will we next see current Bond Daniel Craig strap on a pair of skis and take to the slopes? ""It is inevitable skiing will return,"" Chowdhury says. ""Let's face it, Daniel Craig would look great on skis.""","Opening sequence in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" arguably the greatest Bond scene ever .

"(CNN) -- With so many flashy tablets and high-speed smartphones on display, it's easy to forget the important role low-cost phones play at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. But while headlines are grabbed by expensive devices crammed with high-speed processors, crystal clear display screens and eye-poppingly powerful cameras, many manufacturers are still focused on the basics. For mobile phone makers, real market expansion areas are now found in developing countries where mobiles have still to connect billions of people and offer life-changing internet access. Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt warned in his keynote address to the congress that for the ""aspiring majority"" of five out of seven billion global citizens, ""the web is still a scarce resource."" ""For most people the digital revolution has not arrived yet. Every revolution begins with a small group of people. Imagine how much better it would be with another five billion people online,"" he said. Read more about Schmidt's 'digital caste system' warning . Ahead of the Congress, Dr Hamadoun TourÃ©, secretary-general of the U.N.'s International Telecommunication Union, told CNN that mobiles represented the ""best hope of accelerating progress"" towards global poverty reduction goals. ""With seven billion people's needs to serve, information and communications technologies represent the single most powerful channel we have ever had to reach out to others, wherever they may live, whatever their circumstances,"" he said. Read more about how mobiles are changing lives in Africa . But while marketing mobiles to the developing world was a major theme at the event, there was no getting away from the head-turning technology on display. Gadget freaks were stunned by Nokia's unveiling of a phone featuring a powerful 41 megapixel camera, a coup for a manufacturer that has seen its market share eroded by Apple and Android-based technology in recent years. Korean firm Samsung also won plaudits for its Galaxy Beam, capable of projecting images and videos onto walls. With Apple notably absent from Barcelona (it prefers to stage manage its own product launches), its rivals were able to steal a march on its forthcoming iPad 3 by unwrapping the devices they hope will challenge it. So-called ""quad-core"" processors that potentially double the speed of current mobiles were big news, with emerging Chinese player Huawei among those pushing new superfast devices. Read more about trends at the Mobile World Congress . Quad-core is likely to be a major hit with the gaming industry, with phones and tablets able to support the graphics-intensive activities needed for high-end video software. Not everyone was convinced with the merits of quad-core, however. A senior executive from Microsoft -- which used the event to unveil a preview of its long-awaited tablet-friendly Windows 8 operating system -- decried a quad-core ""arms race"" that rarely resulted in better performance. There were also glimpses into a future in which so-called near-field communication technology will allow mobile phones to replace the cash in our pocket. The role mobiles will play in interacting with our cars was also highlighted by Ford's unveiling of its new B-Max compact and RIM's BlackBerry-integrated Porsche 911. This also raised fresh questions about vehicle security and safety. Read more about cars at risk from hackers . Exploration of the future of mobiles, in which our devices continue to look after our health but also snoop on our lifestyles, also stirred debate over the increasing hold they now have over us.

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Mobile World Congress 2012 -- the home of all things new in the phone and tablet world -- is in full swing. Stuff Magazine has been working the exhibition floor in Barcelona to bring you the cream of this year's crop. Bang & Olufsen squeezes hi-fi into a phone . Danish hi-fi maestro B&O has lent its expertise to the luxury Lumigon T2. Beneath the phone's precision-machined metal details lie B&O ICEpower Audio and an infra-red transmitter for controlling hi-fi equipment. Owners can also look forward to using gesture controls to control the phone with a wave of a hand. Panasonic makes a splash . After an absence of almost six years, Panasonic has plunged back into the European phone market with the Eluga Power waterproof smartphone. It's fronted by a whopping five-inch screen and handily achieves a 50% battery charge in a just 30 minutes. Read more: Ford puts phone apps in the driving seat . Nokia's 41-megapixel cameraphone . Eight megapixel cameras on phones have become increasingly common, but Nokia has smashed that with its 41-megapixel newcomer -- the 808 PureView. Promising better performance in low light and more creative shooting opportunities, it remains to be seen whether more megapixels will really mean better pictures. Samsung tablet headed for schools . The new Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet follows the example of its (only slightly) smaller phone namesake by bringing the stylus back to touchscreens. The included S-pen allows for the use of handwriting recognition and fine control in creative applications like digital drawing and photo manipulation. Samsung is pushing it as an educational tool for use in classrooms, as well as by everyday consumers. ZTE's wafer thin quad-core powerhouse . The comparatively little known Chinese manufacturer ZTE has launched a veritable armada of new phones, the most noteworthy of which is the ZTE Era. The well-specified phone packs the lightning-quick Nvidia Tegra 3 quad core processor while still managing to come in at 7.8mm thick. Vodafone and Visa team up for contactless payment . Visa PayWay will soon be making its way onto Vodafone mobile phones.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A great white shark was responsible for killing a surfer in Southern California this week, authorities said Wednesday. Officials released a photo showing marks from the shark's teeth on the bottom of a surf board. ""The shark in this tragic incident has been positively identified as a 15- to 16-foot great white shark,"" the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office said in a statement. A shark researcher made the determination after examining the body of Francisco Javier Solorio Jr., who was bitten on the left side of his upper torso Tuesday, the statement said. The shark attacked when the 39-year-old was riding waves with three friends off a beach at Vandenberg Air Force Base. One of the friends saw the attack, swam over and pulled Solorio out of the water and onto the beach, Sgt. Mark Williams with the sheriff's office said. The friend gave him first aid while another called for help, he said. Paramedics pronounced Solorio dead at the scene, the sheriff's office said. In October 2010, another shark attack killed a 19-year-old college student off the same beach at Vandenberg. That shark, described as being 14 to 20 feet, bit off the left leg of Lucas McKaine Ransom of Romoland, California, while he was Boogie Boarding with a 20-year-old male friend, authorities said. Ransom was a junior at University of California at Santa Barbara and was majoring in chemical engineering. Surf Beach is one of three that sit on the coastal military base and is the only one open to the public, a military spokesman said Tuesday. Solorio, who was from Orcutt, just two miles from Vandenberg, wasn't affiliated with the military base, said a Vandenberg spokeswoman. Opinion: Even after attacks, sharks need protection . CNN's Amanda Watts, Michael Martinez and Diahann Reyes contributed to this report.","The great white shark was at least 15 feet long, officials say .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A dozen more people have died during ongoing sectarian violence in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, bringing the death toll from the unrest to 62, a local official said Wednesday. ""The town has returned to normalcy, but the martial law and curfew are still in place,"" said Win Myaing, a spokesman for state affairs. ""Residents can't leave their compounds from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. and gatherings of more than five people are not allowed in order to prevent unrest."" Violence between Buddhists and Muslims erupted after the police detained three Muslim men in relation to the rape and killing of a Buddhist woman late last month. Two of the men were sentenced to death this week, the government-run newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported on its website. A third man hanged himself while in detention on June 9. News of the crime appears to have motivated several hundred people to attack a bus in Rakhine in early June, killing 10 Muslims who were on board. Violence between Buddhists and Muslims then spread across the northern part of the state, resulting in the destruction of thousands of homes and the deaths of about 50 people, according to the government. The national government declared a state of emergency in Rakhine, bringing in the military to help restore order. Rakhine is home to the Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Hundreds of Rohingyas tried last week to cross the border into neighboring Bangladesh to flee the sectarian violence. But the Bangladeshi authorities have turned them back, saying they already have too many Rohingya refugees. Bangladeshi officials estimate 300,000 Rohingyas live in the country, with about a 10th of them in two official refugee camps. The unrest in Rakhine appears to have subsided notably from its peak earlier this month. The challenge for the authorities and international aid groups is supporting the thousands of people driven from their homes by the violence. U.N. World Food Programme estimated this week that ""there are about 90,000 displaced people in need of assistance as a result of the recent clashes."" ""The situation in northern Rakhine State remains very tense,"" the human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement Tuesday. The organization called on the authorities to ""ensure full and unfettered humanitarian access to displaced people, and conduct an independent and impartial investigation into recent communal violence."" Vijay Nambiar, a U.N. envoy who visited the affected area, said last week that repairing relations between the different communities in Rakhine would be ""a long haul."" The unrest has tested the efforts of President Thein Sein's administration to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","The World Food Programme estimbates 90,000 people are displaced and need help .

"(CNN) -- Europe's largest powers appeared Wednesday to be united in their goal of removing al Qaeda-linked militants from the West African nation of Mali, where Islamist rebels are fighting to overthrow Mali's government. A quarter-million people have fled Mali -- twice the number who have fled fighting in Syria -- and stirred international fears that Mali will become Africa's next haven for terrorists. Why is Mali important? French troops and warplanes have been helping Malian government forces stop Islamists from overrunning the capital, Bamako, an effort they're calling Operation Serval. French President Francois Hollande told reporters in Paris on Wednesday that it was a ""necessary decision"" to go into the country, a former French colony.

France is ""doing it to help the Malian people."" French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Tuesday that French troops and warplanes joined the battle last week on the side of Malian government forces, and prevented the Islamists from capturing the city of Mopti. Germany's Defense Ministry announced Wednesday it will contribute two Transall transport planes to the offensive. Italy said it is ""ready for a logistical support operation"" in Mali, Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi told a senate hearing on international missions Wednesday.

Belgium's defense minister said Tuesday that Brussels will send two C-130 transport planes, two medical helicopters and 75 soldiers to Mali. Canada, which is supplying logistical support to the mission, sent a military transport plane to France, where it was loaded Tuesday with supplies and personnel to continue on to Mali. The United States has promised to help the effort, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States is reviewing requests from the French, but that no decisions have been made on specifics. A spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry, Selcuk Unal, said Turkey was watching the developments in Mali with concern and added that his government did not prefer unilateral actions and operations, according to the semi-official Turkish news Anadolu Agency. Unal noted that Turkey has issued a travel warning for Mali. Read more: What's behind the instability in Mali? The operation, though, is being led by France, those countries say. Hollande has said France had three aims: stopping the ""terrorist aggression"" from the north; securing Bamako and safeguarding French nationals there; and enabling Mali to recover its territorial integrity. He stressed that France was in Mali at the request of its government, with the support of its neighbors and world powers, and within the framework of international law. ""If we had not taken up our responsibility and if on Friday morning we had not acted with this intervention, where would Mali be today?"" Hollande asked. The fighting has spurred the U.N High Commissioner for Refugees to prepare for a possible flow of refugees from Mali into neighboring countries of Niger, Mauritania and Burkina Faso. ""We have been preparing contingency plans and getting ready on the ground to ensure that we can deal with various possible scenarios,"" said Karl Steinacker, the UNHCR representative in Niger. ""The provision of water, sanitation and hygiene, health, education, protection from sexual and gender-based violence, and child protection are our main priorities,"" he added. Mali was one of the most successful democracies in Africa until insurgents began trying to take it over. Besides taking many lives, the insurgents have destroyed historic shrines in Timbuktu that date to the 15th century. The attackers say the shrines offend Sharia law. Read more: Panetta: U.S. could provide logistical, intel support in Mali . Such allegations have spurred the International Criminal Court to launch a war-crimes investigation, its chief prosecutor announced Wednesday. Fatou Bensouda said Mali's government asked the U.N. tribunal to investigate in July, after Islamists had taken control of much of the country. ""The international crimes committed in Mali have deeply shocked the conscience of humanity,"" Bensouda said Wednesday. ""The legal requirements have been met. We will investigate."" The ICC has found ""reasonable basis"" to support allegations of murder, torture, mutilation, rape and pillaging, Bensouda said. The human rights group Amnesty International welcomed the announcement, calling it ""a crucial step towards justice for the victims."" But the group said the ICC should look at human rights abuses committed by all sides in the conflict, including by government troops and the ethnic Tuareg rebels, whose 2012 revolt set the stage for the current conflict.

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- In the days following Tunisian dictator Zine el Abidine Ben Ali's ousting last January, some media reporting on the so-called ""Jasmine Revolution"" presented the internet as the unique factor that led to the fall of his authoritarian regime. But was this revolution -- which I call the Dignity Revolution -- really driven by the internet? How did internet and social media help in overthrowing dictatorship? Initially, traditional Tunisian media ignored clashes between security forces and peaceful protestors -- who rallied after the death of Mohamed Bouazizi by self-immolation -- in Sidi Bouzid. They then lied about it because, I believe, they were trying to impose a media blackout -- as it had been the case in 2008, during the social movement triggered by protests in the Gafsa mining region. Nevertheless, videos showing Bouazizi's burning body and the clashes immediately starting circulating on the web. People captured Bouazizi's action using their cell phones; they recorded it and uploaded to Facebook. A year later, Bouazizi's legacy still burns . I am one of those ""geeks,"" who are constantly connected to the internet. I was in front of my screen that day when I found the video showing what was going in Sidi Bouzid. I was shocked as it was not the first time a young Tunisian had committed suicide by self-immolation. Some months prior, Abdesslem Trimech had done the same, for similar reasons. I wanted to travel to Sidi Bouzid and see what was happening, but I was unable to afford it. I did, however, want to spread the word about the horrifying incident. I was already in touch with lawyers and a large network of cyber-activists, so I contacted them to collect information, verify it, write about developments and share everything online. This was not an easy task. My blog, Facebook profile and Twitter account were blocked, before being hijacked, probably by Tunisian cyber police. At first, I was able to circumvent censorship and update both my blog and Facebook profile regularly. But after the hijacking episode, I had to create new accounts. My profile had grown through December, as I took part in demonstrations denouncing the violence used against peaceful demonstrators, and shared my photos and video on Facebook and Twitter. At the time, I was also assisting foreign media by giving phone and Skype interviews. On January 8 last year, some French journalists asked me to assist them in the protest areas. I did not think about it at all. I just packed and accompanied them. Tunisians mark anniversary of president's ouster . This journey took us to Djelma, Sidi Bouzid, Regueb, Sbeitla and Kasserine. I took photos of the dead and succeeded in capturing some of the atrocities and crimes of Ben Ali's regime and police against peaceful protestors. I was posting everything on the internet. On January 9, when I was in Regueb, I went to the house of Nizar Slimi, a young man killed just a few hours prior to my visit during a massacre in the city which I suspect was committed by police. It turned out to be a key day in my trip. When I shared my photos, plus images and videos that young residents of the city had given to me to spread through the internet, I was contacted by journalists and people from all over the world. By this time, cyber activists were sharing my work spontaneously, and I was doing the same with theirs. And this is the strength of the internet. The overlapping of contacts and sharing of information by those belonging to the same networks allows the dissemination of information among thousands in a short time. What happened in Sidi Bouzid surprised us, as it surprised the entire world. I had not coordinated as I had for past campaigns; it happened automatically. Former Tunisia leader faces trial over killings . A previous campaign I had been involved in was ""Nhar Ala Ammar,"" a demonstration against censorship that was organized in April 2010. That campaign did, indeed, convince people to leave their screens and to act on the ground. I do not think the internet was, in and of itself, the reason behind the success of Tunisia's uprising. However its use, and cyber activists' ability to share information and mobilize people, pressured Ben Ali's regime. But the internet was only one in a long chain of factors which led to the revolution. Tunisian people were rising up against the socio-political situation. They were willing and determined to get rid of injustice, corruption, nepotism, and poverty. It was the nation's longing for freedom, dignity and social justice which led to the end of Tunisia's dictatorship. People fed up with oppression and inequality defied the violence of the police of a threatened regime. We should never forget that in Tunisia everything started on the ground, in real life. We should never forget that 300 Tunisians, both men and women, sacrificed their lives to allow us to live in dignity.

"(CNN) -- Teenage sensation Lydia Ko followed up her record-breaking round of 10-under-par on day one of the Women's Australian Open with a score of 69, but it wasn't enough to retain the overall lead. Colombian Mariajo Uribe, whose round of nine-under on Thursday was overshadowed by her 15-year-old rival, again kept a bogey off her card as a 67 took her one shot clear on 15-under. Korean World No. 7 Jiyai Shin is hot on the heels of Uribe, her round of six-under drawing her level with Ko on 14-under as the trio gear up for a battle in Canberra over the weekend. ""I went out just wanting to get in the competition more, after two months without playing, so it was a fun round,"" Uribe told the tournament's official website. ""I made good putts, took advantage of the opportunities and the same thing I did today. So I feel pretty good. ""It's funny because the tournaments I play better are the ones that I'm rusty or that I'm not hitting the ball that well. I think I come in with low expectations and things kind of happen. ""I believe in things that are meant to be and I feel it's meant to be for me to play good this week. Hopefully it stays like that for the weekend.'' It is the first time Uribe has led a tournament at the half way stage but she said she was comfortable with the expectation that brings: ""I'm not the type of player who gets nervous. I love pressure. That's when I play better, usually.'' It was perhaps inevitable Ko wouldn't be able to repeat her heroics from day one but a steady round of four-under means she is well placed to launch an attack to claim the fourth tournament victory of her fledgling career. ""I think four-under is a pretty good score out there. I mean, it's not an easy golf course. I'm pretty sure it is a pretty good score for me,"" she said. ""I mean at some points, because my putting was so good yesterday when it didn't go in I was a little disappointed but I think I putted well out there and played well.""","Colombian Mariajo Uribe usurps Lydia Ko to take the lead at Women's Australian Open .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The resignation of Myanmar's first vice president could pave the way for the introduction of more reformers into President Thein Sein's government, experts say. The departure of Tin Aung Myint Oo was announced by the government on Wednesday. An official statement said he was in Singapore receiving treatment for a medical condition. Myanmar's VP resigns for health reasons . A former general with close ties to Myanmar's retired dictator, Than Shwe, Tin has long been viewed by observers as a hardliner who did not agree with the president's reform agenda -- and the vacated cabinet spot presents an opportunity for a change of direction. ""A lot of people are hoping that the president will have time to choose a more moderate vice president, perhaps one who sees eye to eye with him to move the reform process forward,"" said Aung Zaw, the editor of Thailand-based Irrawaddy magazine, which covers Myanmar news. In April, Britain's Financial Times reported that several conservative leaders in Myanmar -- including the vice president -- were in danger of being replaced. Thein Sein has been praised for the country's dramatic changes over the past year, most notably with elections that introduced pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of her party to Parliament. But Myanmar watchers lament the slow pace of change, which some attribute to the administration's conservative faction, led by Tin. Aung San Suu Kyi appeals for help for Myanmar . With his resignation, observers believe a cabinet reshuffle could increase the pace of reform, especially long-awaited economic legislation, following a recent suspension of sanctions against Myanmar by the United States and the European Union. The Foreign Investment Law is meant to encourage overseas businesses to invest in the country by protecting their legal rights. The finalization of the law, however, has met with an unexplained delay. Aung Zaw said the current administration as ineffective, filled with people who do not work well together or talk to each other, and are resistant to change. If Thein Sein does not remove a few such ministers from his government, he said, the president risks undoing the progress that has been made so far. Yet it is not wholly up to the president to fill the empty seat -- far from it. According to Myanmar law, the new vice president will again be a member of the armed forces, nominated by the Parliament's military members. Even so, the armed forces' nomination will likely be a joint decision along with the rest of Parliament and the president. ""There will be a lot of pre-dialogue and discussions; there are already ongoing discussions,"" he said. ""I think they already have chosen a person, but the final decision hasn't come out yet because it's quite secretive at the moment. ""Governments who watch Burma carefully, I think, will be quietly relieved that the vice president is gone,"" he added, using the other name for Myanmar.","Tin Aung Myint Oo, Myanmar's first vice president, resigned, citing health reasons .

"(CNN) -- The National Football League is investigating whether draft prospect Nick Kasa was questioned about his sexual orientation during a recent scouting combine, a spokesman said Wednesday. ""Any team or employee that inquires about impermissible subjects or makes an employment decision based on such factors is subject to league discipline,"" said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello. League policy states that teams ""neither consider nor inquire about sexual orientation in the hiring process,"" Aiello said. ""In addition, there are specific protections in our collective bargaining agreement with the players that prohibit discrimination against any player, including on the basis of sexual orientation."" Kasa, who played tight end at the University of Colorado, told CNN earlier Wednesday that during the combine, he was asked: ""Do you have a girlfriend? Are you married? Do you like girls?"" ""Those kind of things, and it was kind of weird,"" he told CNN. ""But like they would ask you with a straight face, and it's a pretty weird experience altogether."" Kasa did not say who asked him those questions. NFL.com said that NFL teams ""try to catch prospects off-guard when they interview them at the NFL Scouting Combine."" The combine is a skills audition for NFL scouts and coaches before the draft, which this year will be held April 25 to 27.

"(CNN) -- One year ago, Tunisian fruit vendor Mohamed Bouazizi torched himself out of economic despair, and the news of his desperate act spread like a brushfire across the North African country, through the rest of the Arab world and around the globe. His plight touched a chord in Tunisia, stirring popular anger and protest. Less than a month after the self-immolation, Tunisian President Zine el Abidine ben Ali was ousted from power. The Tunisian revolution emboldened Egyptians. Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center and fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy, constantly heard about Bouazizi and Tunisia in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. They couldn't believe that such open protest to a long-standing dictatorship could unfold. Subsequently, an Egyptian uprising took hold and President Hosni Mubarak was ousted from power. In another corner of the Arab world, Ibrahim Mothana, a Yemeni activist, said the self-immolation and the ouster of Ben Ali stunned his fellow Yemenis because citizens actually confronted ""a police state, where you cannot react."" After months of massive demonstrations, Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh is now on his way out of office under a power transition plan brokered by a coalition of Gulf Arab states. ""I think he resonated everywhere,"" Shaikh said. ""As the narrative was told, as the story was told it did strike a chord with so many Arabs."" Bouazizi was an unknown street vendor struggling to feed his family by selling fruit, earning the equivalent of barely $10 a day as he pushed his cart through the streets of Sidi Bouzid in central Tunisia. Tunisian on life one year later: No fear . On the morning of December 17, a female municipal inspector named Faida Hamdy accosted Bouazizi. An altercation erupted during which the inspector seized Bouazizi's produce. After the incident, the humiliated fruit vendor repeatedly tried and failed to get the attention of town officials. Finally, he purchased fuel, doused himself with it, and lit a lethal flame outside the gates of the governorate building. ""These government inspectors used to confiscate our goods and demand bribes,"" says Bouazizi's uncle Ridha, who also operates a fruit cart in downtown Sidi Bouazid. ""It was because of their tyranny that Mohamed set himself on fire."" Almost immediately, protests erupted in Sidi Bouzid and then quickly spread to other cities and towns across the country. Bouazizi died of his injuries in a hospital on January 4. On Saturday, thousands of Tunisians gathered in the streets of Sidi Bouzid to celebrate the first anniversary of the uprising. A monument featuring Bouazizi's fruit stand was inaugurated and political leaders honored the man for his sacrifice. ""Thank you Sidi Bouzid, for the freedom we enjoy today,"" said Tunisia's new president, Moncef Marzouki. Marwan Kraidy, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the American University in Beirut, said Bouazizi was ""definitely the catalyst of the Tunisian revolt, which due to its success catalyzed the Egyptian uprising."" ""The incident went viral because of the intense global media coverage of the Tunisian revolt,"" Kraidy said. ""Every time the unfolding events were covered, readers, listeners and viewers were reminded of the fruit vendor who immolated himself and became a symbol for a population fed up with injustice and oppression."" Tunisian journalist Zied Mhirsi, who is one of the founders of a news website called tunisia-live.net and is a stringer for CNN, said local politicians helped forge the image of Bouazizi and it evolved into what has become a ""universal story."" As protests unfolded after Bouazizi's self-immolation, the government could have reacted the way politicians do in the United States and other Western nations, Mhirsi said. They could have staved off popular discontent by immediately promising to look into the incident and its underlying causes and come up with a solution. But instead, Mhirsi said, the government cracked heads and shot protesters. ""The government lost the battle when they used real bullets in a country where we did not see a gun. Here we have the government shooting people with real bullets. That was something that fueled the insurgency,"" Mhirsi said. Eric Goldstein, North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said there were other incidents in Tunisia that ""could have lit the flame,"" but this one united a series of elements with which people could identify, such as day-to-day injustices and police harassment. Bouazizi was part of a younger generation that saw no future and he came from the interior of the county, a region long neglected and the object of contempt, Goldstein said. ""He was Joe Tunisian,"" Goldstein said. ""There had been other self-immolations. This one just captured the imagination of Tunisians, both the elites and the ordinary Tunisians."" Goldstein said it soon dawned on people across the region that if Tunisians could oust their dictator, they could do it, too. ""It's not just the Bouazizi example. It was the whole Tunisian thing that happened so quickly that inspired them."" The protests that began after Bouazizi's death were apolitical and spurred by the lack of jobs. But the president claimed the protests were stirred by terrorists and outsiders, and the government cracked down, a reaction that reflected a regime that never faced ""genuine challenges from below,"" Goldstein said. ""Tunisians were repelled by that kind of explanation,"" he said. Even though Ben Ali eventually visited Bouazizi in the hospital and said he'd create more jobs, the damage was done. ""Every step of the way he had to catch up, but he was always five steps behind,"" Goldstein said of Ben Ali. Shaikh said Bouazizi was seen as a man who struggled and tried to do the right thing, Shaikh said, but he wasn't born into the right clan or elite and was under the thumb of a dictatorial regime. The fact that he was a well-known market vendor also contributed to his story, Shaikh said, noting that ""he was somebody quite well liked and struggling. Market vendors get to know a lot of people. That contributed to his recognition."" Like much of the Arab world, he was a young person who had to contend with a tilted playing field. Mothana said the uprisings across the Arab world would have happened with or without Bouazizi's act, noting that this ""didn't come out of the blue."" It was a ""boiling point"" reflecting the range of indignities common across the region. Outside the Arab world, people watched the uprisings unfold. Bouazizi posthumously received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, one of five winners honored for their role in the Arab Spring. The once-unknown fruit vendor's actions stirred hope and courage, and that, Shaikh said, is part of his legacy. ""If there are certain actions these regimes are taking which are beyond the pale, people are not willing to accept that,"" Shaikh said.","NEW: Tunisians celebrate the first anniversary of the uprising .

"(CNN) -- For the billionaire who has everything, sometimes a superyacht just isn't enough -- that's why the world's wealthiest are buying ""gigayachts."" These boats are the ultimate status symbol -- a sign of eminence, power and a seemingly limitless supply of cash. And when it comes to showing off wealth and status it seems the rule is ""the bigger the better."" ""There's definitely a 'mine is bigger than yours' syndrome in this industry and there is a desire to have the best. That's the great thing about these yachts,"" said Jonathan Beckett, CEO of Burgess Yachts, one of the world's leading yacht brokers. ""When you get up to 'gigayacht' status, it is all about the best and these people are used to having exceptional possessions around them all the time,"" Beckett continued. Although the term ""gigayacht"" is not new, it is becoming increasingly prevalent as owners seek bigger and better yachts. ""There is no standard definition of what a gigayacht is,"" says Paul Ashton, editor of SuperYacht World. ""A gigayacht I would say is anything that is over 220 feet (67 meters) where the majority of the yacht is customized and bespoke."" Their owners are part of a small but illustrious set that includes Russian oligarchs, Saudi royalty and international business tycoons. China's super rich eye superyachts . The yacht to beat is currently Roman Abramovich's ""Eclipse."" The largest private yacht in the world at 163 meters long, ""Eclipse"" is believed to feature around 24 guest cabins, two swimming pools and a mini-submarine, and was rumored to have cost between $540 million and $1.1 billion. Although not all gigayachts come with that pricetag, Ashton says the standard measure is around â‚¬1 million ($1.36 million) per meter of length. ""That works to a certain extent, but you also have to take into consideration which yard it is made in and the bespoke details involved,"" he said. While that pricing means gigayachts are strictly for the super rich, you get a lot of bang for your bucks, Beckett explained: ""There is nothing standard when it comes to this area of our market. But if you are purchasing a superyacht you would want a vessel that was transglobal and you'd want a reasonable speed. ""You'd probably want at least two helicopter platforms, so you can land your own helicopter and visitors can also land theirs, cinemas, hospitals, spas, large entertainments areas and hairdressing salons. ""These vessels have anything from 80 to 120 people onboard including the crew, so it's a little town."" P. Diddy sails on $850,000-a-week superyacht controlled by iPad . But it's not all about status. The trend towards bigger yachts is due in part to new technological advances in the yachting industry as well as the changing lifestyles of gigayacht owners, says Becket. ""Going back to when I first started in the business, yachting used to be a form of camping almost,"" he said. ""Nowadays, people are moving aboard their yachts and using them as a second home. ""Instead of going for one or two weeks, people will move onboard for the whole summer,"" he said. The world's second-largest gigayacht, the ""Dubai,"" is a perfect example of this, says Ashton. Owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of the Emirate of Dubai and Prime Minister of the U.A.E, the ""Dubai"" is a working boat as well as a holiday yacht. ""There is room onboard for all of the crew, but there are also 20-30 cabins for clerical and support staff that you need when you're running your business from onboard,"" said Ashton. But the financial crisis means even gigayacht owners are having to spend smarter, says Beckett. ""We've got a whole new market landscape. No one's looking to pay a strong price for a yacht, as they were pre-2008,"" he said. ""Then it didn't matter how much you paid, it was cool to pay top price, now it matters a lot. In today's market it is cool to be paying a low price."" But, says Beckett, this doesn't mean superyacht owners are going to scrimp on luxury. ""Oh no, they want it all,"" he said. ""There is no compromise, except on the price.""","Gigayachts are viewed by some as the ultimate status symbol .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Supreme Court majority appeared poised Tuesday to give a woman convicted of trying to poison her best friend a chance to argue that her case should have been handled in state courts. Carol Anne Bond was given a longer prison sentence in the federal system, after being charged with violating an international treaty on the use of chemical weapons. The case of toxic love has soap-opera elements, but Bond's lawyers argued she was being treated like an international terrorist, instead of someone caught up in a domestic dispute. Several justices seemed to agree. ""She wants to make the argument that this is a strictly state, local crime, and that any attempt by the federal government to convert it into a treaty-based terrorism crime is erroneous,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""Why doesn't she have standing to make that argument?"" Justice Elena Kagan added, ""It's all a question of what Congress' scope of authority is under the (Constitution's) Necessary and Proper Clause"" on federal authority. The implications go far beyond this case, and could establish important precedents on the strength and purpose of the Constitution's 10th Amendment, which preserves state sovereignty. It is also an issue roiling the current political debate, especially among Tea Party conservatives in this post-9/11, security-conscious environment. At issue is whether Bond has a right -- called ""standing""-- to contest her conviction on grounds it went far beyond the normal scope of federal jurisdiction in this kind of crime. The high court, in a case from more than 70 years ago, suggested that this so-called ""gateway"" claim could only be raised by state officials, not individual plaintiffs. Bond, a native of Barbados, lived outside Philadelphia and worked as a microbiologist. As a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case: ""Bond was excited when her closest friend, Myrlinda Haynes, announced she was pregnant. Bond's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband, Clifford Bond, was the child's father. She vowed revenge."" Bond, known to her family as Betty, struck back by stealing dangerous chemicals -- arsenic-based 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine -- from her company, and also obtained potassium dichromate over the internet. Both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic, even lethal harm with very little physical contact. The 40-year-old then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months, secretly sprinkling small amounts of the chemicals on an apartment doorknob, car door handles and a mailbox. While suffering no more than a chemical burn on her thumb, Haynes grew suspicious -- one of the chemicals was a bright orange powder. After getting little help from local police, she called postal inspectors in 2007, who set up surveillance cameras. Bond was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and car muffler, court records show. She was soon arrested. Bond admitted her guilt early on and claimed she never meant to kill Haynes, but only wanted to cause her ""an uncomfortable rash."" The defendant also said her friend's betrayal caused an ""emotional breakdown"" that made her respond in such a shocking fashion. Instead of being charged with simple assault, which may have gotten her six months to a year or two in state prison, Bond was indicted in federal court on two counts of mail fraud and two counts of violating a federal law and international treaty for the possession and use of ""chemical weapons."" When a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court, Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed. She received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $12,000 in fines and restitution. An appeals court ultimately rejected her standing claims. The strange case took an even stranger turn when the Supreme Court was asked to weigh in. After first adamantly claiming Bond had no right to appeal, the Justice Department reversed course. But the Obama administration still believes Bond's federal conviction was valid. In court arguments, the standing issue dominated the debate. ""This isn't sarin,"" a lethal nerve agent terrorists have used in the past against civilians, said Bond's attorney Paul Clement. ""There is something sort of odd about the government's theory that says that I can buy a chemical 'weapon' at Amazon.com. That strikes me as odd."" He added Bond used a ""commonly available chemical."" That received a sympathetic response from some on the court after Clement's legal opponent stepped up. ""If it is in fact a 10th Amendment claim, unless you have a state official or the state, there is no standing,"" said attorney Stephen McAllister. ""Pretty harsh, if we're talking about prudential standing, to deny that to a criminal defendant, isn't it?"" replied Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice Anthony Kennedy went further. ""Your underlying premise is that the individual has no interest in whether or not the state has surrendered its powers to the federal government, and I just don't think the Constitution was framed on that theory,"" he said. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pushed McAllister to admit there was no previous high court case in which a criminal defendant was held to have lacked standing to challenge a statute under which the defendant was prosecuted. Since the Obama Justice Department admitted its handling of the standing issue was wrong, the justices had to appoint an outside private attorney to argue what the government had originally claimed. McAllister, an experienced lawyer and onetime law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, was given the tough assignment. Many conservatives hoped the majority right-leaning bench would use the opportunity to delve further into the scope of the 10th Amendment, which states, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people."" While some justices thought the case should be decided only on standing grounds, others were more eager to explore the larger issues. Obama administration attorney Michael Dreeben argued Congress' power to enforce treaties and to control commerce was sweeping, including state ""regulation of a commodity."" ""Given the breadth of this statute, that would be a very far-reaching decision, wouldn't it?"" said Justice Samuel Alito, clearly troubled. By the federal government's reading, he noted, ""a chemical weapon is a weapon that includes toxic chemicals. And a toxic chemical is a chemical that can cause death to animals. And pouring vinegar in a goldfish bowl, I believe, will cause death to the goldfish, so that's a chemical weapon,"" which could potentially mean life imprisonment for the perpetrator. He suggested that was not what Congress had intended. In the broader political context, conservatives, along with a healthy mix of liberals and libertarians, worry that the federal government and Congress have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states, especially in the criminal arena. And it's not just felonies. Areas like gun ownership, zoning laws, environmental regulations, taxation, health care and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of a high court decision. Even if Bond prevails on the standing issue, she might still face an uphill battle in phase two of the her legal fight, getting her federal conviction ultimately thrown out on 10th Amendment grounds. Either way, it may come too late to do her any good, if the justices sidestep the 10th Amendment aspects. She is set to be freed from federal prison in West Virginia next year, likely before any future case on the merits would be resolved. A high court ruling will likely be issued by June. The case is Bond v. U.S. (09-1227).","The case involves a woman convicted of federal charges related to chemical weapons .

"(CNN) -- Some Gulf Coast residents and former clean-up workers are suffering from an array of mysterious illnesses, according to a Louisiana physician who has treated dozens of patients complaining of similar symptoms. ""I'm dealing with a wide array of people and the symptoms are almost identical in all of them,"" Dr. Mike Robichaux, an ear, nose and throat doctor based in Raceland, Louisiana, told CNN's Natalie Allen. ""What's been really unique about it is that patients have come in with a severe amount of memory loss. Very high blood pressure -- blood pressures that are going sky high and then coming down to normal, and then blood sugar levels that are fluctuating. Lastly would be some pulmonary problems and some fairly serious (gastrointestinal) problems."" The doctor said he's treated about 60 patients suffering from some combination of these symptoms but believes many more are suffering. Robichaux said ""there's no question"" that these health difficulties are caused by contact with oil and dispersant. ""The only question is what (is) in this soup of materials is causing the problems,"" he said. ""Some (people) have been exposed to all of these chemicals, some only a few, some for long periods of time, some for not very long."" He discussed the case of a 27-year-old man who suffers abdominal pain so severe he must take morphine to relieve it. The man also has debilitating headaches and severe memory loss, but for months had no idea what was causing his symptoms. Robichaux said this experience was ""typical"" of a subset of patients he sees. He said the health problems he sees get very little national attention. ""There hasn't been a single article on health issues,"" he said. ""They'll talk about the pelicans and shorebirds, the crawfish, the crabs, the shrimp and so forth ... and there's nothing on human impact."" The April 20, 2010 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history, with more than 200 million gallons of oil released into the Gulf. Hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersant went into the water as well. At its peak of the crisis, in June 2010, 37% of Gulf waters, or 88,522 square miles, were closed to fishing.","Dozens of patients are suffering similarly, Dr. Robichaux says .

"(CNN) -- Several commercial fishing areas that were closed because of the BP oil spill had an ""emergency reopening"" Saturday, Louisiana officials said. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said it coordinated the move with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Commercial fishing reopened for finfish and shrimp in portions of state waters in Lafourche, Terrebonne, Plaquemines and Jefferson parishes, the department said in a statement. Adjustments also were made to the areas closed to recreational fishing west of Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. Those areas closed to commercial fishing now match the areas closed to recreational fishing, the agency said. Comprehensive FDA tests of seafood samples from previously closed areas showed fish are safe for consumption, according to the statement. Saturday's openings do not include the commercial harvest of crabs and oysters. The FDA testing method for crabs takes significantly longer to process, officials said. Some of the environmental damage to the Gulf of Mexico since the April 20 rig explosion and subsequent spill appears to have abated in recent weeks. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reopened 5,144 square miles of Gulf waters on Tuesday for commercial and recreational fishers to catch finfish, saying that since July 3 its data have shown no oil in the area. Coast Guard observers flying over the area in the past 30 days also have not observed any oil. In addition, NOAA said fish caught in the area and tested by NOAA experts have shown no signs of contamination.","Louisiana reopens commercial fishing in several areas closed by the BP spill .

"(CNN) -- ""Everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well,"" National Incident Commander Thad Allen said Friday of the now-plugged BP gusher in the Gulf, adding that officials are now considering other options in addition to the relief well. Work will resume on a relief well as scientists and BP engineers continue to assess whether a planned ""bottom kill"" is necessary, he said. The BP oil well, which ruptured April 20 after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, spilled more than 2 million gallons of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico before being successfully shut. Allen said that pressure tests were finished and that pressure within the wellhead was unchanged. That means there are options about how to handle the well, which has stopped pouring oil into the Gulf, he said. ""We have successfully shut in this well. We have something now that we haven't had before and we have we have -- I wouldn't call it a luxury -- but we have the trade space to consider alternatives under less than a high-pressure situation."" Allen said crews probably did ""too good a job on the top kill."" Cement and mud got into a core area of the well. But Allen said it's not clear how thick the cement layer is, or how vulnerable it might be to pressure inside the well. ""Everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well,"" Allen said. ""The relief well will be finished. How it gets finished will be determined on risk mitigation and the way forward is the essence of what is being discussed right now. The relief well will be finished. We will kill the well."" As they await answers about the condition of the well, businesses in the Gulf Coast are hoping high-profile visitors will help boost local economies. President Obama and his wife, Michelle, plan to travel to the region this weekend to support businesses that have been devastated by the oil disaster. One of their daughters, Sasha, will join them for the trip. Their other daughter, Malia, is at a camp and will not make the trip, a senior administration official said. The family will leave Saturday morning for Panama City Beach, Florida. ""Even as the president talks about what our next steps are in our response, obviously part of this will be highlighting the tremendous economic toll that has taken place,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters earlier this week. Visitors spent more than $34 billion in 2008 in congressional districts along the Gulf Coast, sustaining 400,000 jobs. The effects of the oil spill on the region's travel industry could last up to three years and cost up to $22.7 billion, according to an analysis conducted last month by Oxford Economics for the U.S. Travel Association. In preparing the research, Oxford Economics looked at current spending, government models predicting oil flow and the effect of 25 past crises on tourism to develop a model to gauge the Gulf disaster's impact. Case studies of past disasters -- including the SARS respiratory disease outbreak, Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Asian tsunami -- show that tourism often is affected beyond the disaster area and long after the resolution of the crisis. To mitigate the effects of the disaster, changing perceptions is key. ""The president will meet with those folks and have a chance to update, I think, the region on where we are,"" Gibbs said. ""And I think it will be important for the president to talk about what are the next steps in bringing the region back."" Meanwhile, work is expected to resume Friday on the drilling of a relief well that is intended to give engineers a better look at the core of the well. Pressure tests will help them make a recommendation to former Adm. Thad Allen, the federal government point man on the disaster, on whether a bottom kill is necessary to permanently seal the ruptured deepwater oil well. The well erupted after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that left 11 dead. A temporary cap contained the spill on July 15, and nearly 3,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud and cement drove the oil back under the ocean floor last week in the static kill process. The well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels (nearly 2.3 million gallons) of oil per day before it was capped. Since then, fresh, green grass has started growing again in some of the hardest-hit marshes of southern Louisiana, but oil continues to wash ashore in some places.

"(CNN) -- Federal investigators are looking into whether stowaways are tucked inside a shipping container aboard a vessel docked at a Newark, New Jersey, seaport. During a routine security check, a Coast Guard boarding team heard sounds coming from inside the container, prompting the investigation, according to Coast Guard spokeswoman Lt j.g. Fannie Wilks. ""There is no way to know exactly what is inside because we have not opened it yet, but we can knock on the container and hear someone knock back,"" she said. ""Thus it is our understanding that there is at least one person in the container."" The Cyprus-flagged cargo ship -- which maintains about 2,000 containers -- last docked in Egypt, and had made a stop in Pakistan after originating in India, officials said. ""U.S. Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers and agents are currently investigating allegations of stowaways,"" said Anthony L. Bucci, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Inspectors first checked the ship around 3 a.m. Wednesday. Just prior to docking, the inspectors tapped on the bulkhead and heard something, said Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe. They ""tapped twice"" and got ""two taps back,"" he said. ""Tapped 3 times"" and got ""three taps back,"" Rowe added, a process done periodically over several hours as they investigated. But inspectors haven't heard the suspicious tapping since the ship docked at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. The vessel -- which is named the Ville D' Aquarius and managed by Global Ship Lease Services Limited -- is not loaded with dangerous cargo, and the container in question is underneath several other containers, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Michelle Krupa.

"(CNN) -- Humans have always looked to birds for joy, inspiration and comfort, but if we look toward the birds of the Gulf Coast today, we feel no comfort, only a deep and growing unease. What began on April 20 with the horrific loss of 11 human lives in the explosion of the offshore oil rig Deepwater Horizon now threatens to become a devastating and far-reaching environmental disaster -- one that should shake the American people to our very core. Hour by hour, a massive oil slick is spreading to the fragile coastal wetlands and barrier islands of the Mississippi River Delta in Louisiana. Coastal areas of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are also at risk. Birds are key indicators of the environment in which they -- and we -- live and eat and breathe. Their health or decline eventually mirrors our own, and the diagnosis this week isn't looking very good. The spreading oil threatens ""Important Bird Areas,"" sites identified by Audubon and other conservation experts as vital to the health or even the survival of entire species. Coastal bird species -- graceful terns, gangly pelicans, peaceful plovers -- have everything to lose if the oil reaches them. It is breeding season for these year-round coastal denizens, and it is also peak migration season for millions of other birds headed north, right through the areas that may be hardest hit. A host of well-known species are at risk, among them: . • Brown pelicans, the state bird of Louisiana, are incubating eggs on barrier islands. The species was removed from the endangered species list late last year -- a victory to be sure -- but nevertheless faces an uncertain future. • Reddish egret, a tall, colorful bird that ""dances"" wildly in the surf as it hunts for prey, is a scarce denizen of warm, salty coasts. • Royal terns, and several of their relatives, nest on beaches and dunes and catch small fish by executing spectacular plunge-dives into the waters of the Gulf. But a dive into oily water could prove deadly for these beautiful creatures. • Mottled ducks, locally called ""summer ducks"" because they are the only ducks that breed along the Gulf Coast, living, feeding and nesting in coastal salt marshes where oil would have devastating consequences. • Seaside sparrows, tiny and secretive marsh birds, will have nowhere to go if the salt marsh edges they frequent are destroyed by oil. They would simply fade away. Why does it matter if birds are in trouble? Like most Americans, I believe that living things have intrinsic worth and should be celebrated and allowed to thrive. They add beauty and wonder to our world. But if that doesn't convince you, consider this: If birds are in trouble, so are we. The problem is simply too big to contain. Birds and marine life will die. Sensitive habitats will be damaged. Industries and families will suffer. Cleanup will cost billions and take months or even years. Long-term recovery is uncertain. We commend the federal, state and industry personnel who are working long hours in difficult and dangerous conditions attempting to stop and contain the spill. However, everyone shares the sickening realization that even heroic efforts probably will not be enough to avert significant environmental damage. This disaster confronts us squarely with the risks to which we expose ourselves and our environment any time we drill for oil. As a nation, we must stop and consider what we've done, and what we will do tomorrow. We must pause and reflect on what places can truly be considered ""safe"" for oil extraction, having the courage to recognize that in some, the risks are simply too great and the resources too precious to spoil. Elected representatives must keep the picture of this spreading catastrophe in mind as they consider the path to our energy future. America's energy needs are great. But so is our concern for the people and nature imperiled by our addiction to fossil fuel. It's time to redouble our efforts to move toward a future powered by cleaner, renewable sources of energy that make the planet a safer place for us and all the life with which we share it. The images from the Gulf are tragic reminders that we cannot afford to wait. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frank Gill.","Offshore oil rig explosion may produce long-term environmental devastation .

"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- A wind shift could push more oil from BP's Deepwater Horizon gusher into the Mississippi Delta and areas west of the river, which is ""bad news for Louisiana,"" Gov. Bobby Jindal said Monday afternoon. Louisiana has been mostly spared since the oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later about 50 miles (80 kilometers) off the southeast coast of Louisiana. The catastrophe is sending 210,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico each day. Most of the slick has been centered in an area east of the environmentally sensitive delta. ""We've said all along that the oil coming west of the river would pose a whole new set of challenges,"" Jindal said at a news conference. He detailed efforts to place booms and other restraining devices into four passes near Grand Isle to prevent the oil from reaching land. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters had warned over the weekend that the Mississippi Delta and areas to the northeast of it, including Breton Sound, Chandeleur Islands and the mainland behind them, could see oil hit the coast by Tuesday. Further east, scientists were analyzing tar balls found on a beach on Dauphin Island, Alabama, to determine whether they were caused by the oil spill, Coast Guard spokesman Erik Swanson said. The tar balls are ""pieces of emulsified oil"" shaped like pancakes, ranging in size from dimes to golf balls, Swanson said, adding they can sometimes occur naturally. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry confirmed the presence of tar balls in some areas, but said they were ""easy to clean up."" She said booms were being moved toward Grand Isle in anticipation of oil reaching the area soon. In addition to the use of dispersants on the surface and controlled burns, weather allowing, officials were carrying out a third test of sub-sea dispersants to determine their impact, said Landry. She said officials were trying to do in a few weeks what normally would take a few years. So far, the spill has had little impact on wildlife, said Mark J. Musaus, deputy director of the southeast region for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Only a few birds have been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center at Fort Jackson, Louisiana, he said. Two of them, a gannet and a pelican, were released Monday back into the wild. Another oiled pelican was still in the treatment center, as was a green heron, he said. The stakes are high for residents of coastal Louisiana who make their living from fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. The government has closed parts of the Gulf to fishing. The affected area, which is east of the Mississippi Delta, comprises about 4.5 percent of the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA said. Hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the Gulf coastline. Thousands of workers and volunteers also have been skimming the water's surface. A BP executive said Monday the energy company is working ""parallel paths"" to fix the oil well. The failure over the weekend of a four-story dome to cap the leak has led BP to move on to other options, including the use of a smaller chamber over the leak and shooting garbage into the gaping hole to try to plug the gusher, said Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production. The company also is considering placing a valve or a new blowout preventer on top of the existing one, which is not functioning as well as it should, Suttles told CNN's ""American Morning"" program. As the name suggests, a blowout preventer is a device that is supposed to clamp shut over a leaking wellhead. David Nagel, executive vice president of BP America, said the blowout preventer may be working better than some people believe, limiting the gusher to 5,000 barrels of oil a day. ""We have a blowout preventer that we think is mostly shut,"" Nagel said in an off-camera briefing with reporters Monday in Washington, adding that the situation seems to be stable. He said remote-control inspection machines had not been able to check how the blowout assembly was working but ""something is constraining the leak"" from what would have been a flow estimated between 40,000 to 60,000 barrels a day. Suttles said BP is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow to another pipe. ""What we're going to do is keep developing options until we get this flow stopped,"" Suttles said. ""That started about a week ago,"" Suttles said. ""That work continues. The well is at about 9,000 feet. ""About 5,000 feet of that is the water depth. Then the rest is drilling below the seafloor. We're slightly ahead of plan here. These are complex tasks, but we're making very good process."" It may take up to three months to reach the target area, Nagel said. And progress will slow the deeper the drill bit goes, he said. ""The rock gets harder, and every time you have to replace a worn-out drill bit, it takes more time to withdraw and stack the drill pipe,"" in 90-foot sections on the construction vessel to change the bit, re-assemble the sections and lower the drill pipe back into action, said Nagel. On Friday, BP lowered the massive containment vessel over the well to cap the larger of two leak points. But that plan was thwarted Saturday after ice-like hydrate crystals formed when gas combined with water blocked the top of the dome and made it buoyant. BP has built the smaller dome and it is already available, Suttles said Monday. That device would keep most of the water out at the beginning of the capping process and would allow engineers to pump in methanol to keep the hydrates from forming, Suttles said. Methanol is a simple alcohol that can be used as an antifreeze. Called ""Tophat,"" the 5-foot-tall, 4-foot-diameter structure weighs less than two tons. The structure is to be deployed this week by the drill ship Enterprise, to which it is to be connected by two strings of pipe -- one inside the other with a space in between for hot water, he said. The process of stopping the gusher with garbage is called a ""junk shot."" Under that procedure, debris such as shredded tires, golf balls and similar objects would be shot under extremely high pressure into the blowout preventer in an attempt to clog it and stop the leak. That procedure would be done late next week, Suttles said Monday. Federal investigators are still trying to determine what caused the explosion that sunk the Deepwater Horizon, which was owned by BP contractor Transocean Ltd. BP is legally required to cover economic damages from the spill up to $75 million. But Florida Sen. Bill Nelson has introduced legislation that would raise the liability cap to $10 billion. ""If this gusher continues for several months, it's going to cover up the Gulf Coast and it's going to get down into the loop current and that's going to take it down the Florida Keys and up the east coast of Florida, and you are talking about massive economic loss to our tourism, our beaches, to our fisheries, very possibly disruption of our military testing and training,"" Nelson said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" BP has received 3,400 claims for lost income and damages and 295 of those claims have been paid, at a price of $3.5 million, Nagel said. ""It's a host of things,"" he said, ""The immediate loss of income is being handled very quickly."" None of the payouts are for liability, but Nagel stressed ""the interim plans are in no way meant to be final."" Also Monday, organizers announced a ""Gulf Aid"" benefit concert for south Louisiana fishermen and wetlands restoration. The concert, to be held Sunday, is slated to feature Lenny Kravitz, Allen Toussaint, Mos Def and the Voice of the Wetlands Allstars featuring Dr. John, Cyril Neville and Tab Benoit. CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.","Louisiana has been mostly spared since oil rig exploded and sank off southeast coast .

"(CNN) -- State and federal authorities are investigating the apparent double homicide of two Coast Guard members who were shot dead on an island off Alaska's coast, prompting the lockdown of their base and at least one nearby school. It's possible that the shooter, or shooters, remain at large, according to a Coast Guard statement. ""We're treating this as a double homicide,"" said FBI spokesman Eric Gonzalez, who noted that the slayings occurred inside the Coast Guard Communications Station Kodiak. Coast Guard investigators, island police, state troopers and the FBI are investigating the incident. ""We are deeply saddened that we lost two shipmates,"" Capt. Jesse Moore said in a news release. ""This is a rare occurrence, and we are going to do everything possible to ensure we find out exactly what happened."" The victims have not yet been identified by name. Their base is on what the city of Kodiak's website calls the second-largest island in the United States, situated in the Gulf of Alaska about 250 miles southwest of Anchorage. The borough of Kodiak Island has about 13,600 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Coast Guard facility normally houses about 60 people. ""It's definitely the topic of conversation right now,"" said Cheryl Montgomery, a manager at Henry's Great Alaskan Restaurant. ""The town's people are very much on edge here."" Montgomery said that her restaurant remained abuzz Friday with rumors of who may have carried out the shootings, though ""nobody knows what's actually going on."" ""There's so many weird and bizarre stories running around right now,"" she said. City Manager Aimee Kniaziowski said her office has not been instructed to take additional security precautions. ""We're just conducting our business until we're told otherwise,"" she said. The small town is reeling from the loss, she added, calling the killings ""devastating."" Peterson Elementary School, which is on Coast Guard property in Kodiak, went into lockdown mode around 8:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) after school leaders got a call from military police, Principal Beth Cole said. By 11 a.m., they shifted to ""lock in"" mode, allowing for more movement within the school, though lunch was still delivered to students in class as a precaution, Cole said. No people were allowed in and out of the building all day. Three other elementaries, one middle school and one high school on the island were also affected, school district Superintendent Stewart McDonald said. Those schools were on ""lock in"" status starting at 11:30 a.m. so that activities could continue as normal, except for the fact that no one could enter or leave the buildings. At the time, Kodiak High School was hosting an Alaska Association of Student Government meeting involving youths from around the state. All restrictions for the district's roughly 2,200 students were called off about 1 p.m. after state troopers called school officials and said that operations could return to normal, according to McDonald. CNN's Alta Spells contributed to this report.","Schools on Kodiak island were given the all-clear at 1 p.m., an official says .

"(CNN) -- Sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean on a stunning bay in the western tip of metropolitan France, the city of Brest has at its heart one of the country's most animated harbors. With its proximity to the British Isles, this area of France is steeped in Celtic heritage. As such, accordions are eschewed for bagpipes and the locals display a preference for zesty ciders over fine wines. The region even has its own Celtic language, ""Breton"", which is still spoken by nearly 200,000 people. Brest was sadly all but destroyed in the ""Battle of Brest"" during World War II. It has since been completely rebuilt and is now a sophisticated city that hosts some of Europe's most theatrical sailing festivals. By far the most prominent of these is ""Les Tonnerres de Brest"" (""Brest Festival of the Sea."") Every four years, more than 2,000 traditional boats sail from countries as far flung as Madagascar and Mexico to take part in the event, which is attended by nearly 700,000 avid spectators. This year marks its 20th anniversary and, according to the festival organizers, it will be ""the biggest and most spectacular event yet."" From July 13, Brest will be transformed into five ""villages,"" representing this year's five honorary countries: Mexico, Norway, Indonesia, Morocco and Russia -- all of whom are sending a minor flotilla of historical boats. From village to village, visitors will be able to learn about each country's maritime heritage and sample its music, food and handicraft. ""There is no other festival quite like it if you like classic boats,"" said Adam Purser, who has sailed from England to Brest three times since 2000. ""Everywhere you look there are tall ships and the atmosphere is fantastic. There is good food and music and you get to race your ships along a beautiful coastline. I wouldn't miss it for the world,"" he said. But it's not just an event for maritime history buffs, this year the festival is also welcoming modern boats. Racing enthusiasts will be able to see the finish of the New York to Brest multi-hull transatlantic ""Krys Ocean Race"", featuring some of the world's fastest trimarans. ""The festival has something for everyone. It's really becoming a universal exhibition of all types of boats,"" said Chantal Guillerm, the festival's director of communications. ""Les jeudis du Port"" (Thursdays at the harbor) Those who can't make it to the summer's main maritime festival can still experience Brest's unique harbor each Thursday during the summer months when it is transformed into a vibrant arts space, packed with live street theater, concerts, comedy and markets. The music on offer is as eclectic as it is exciting, with a mixture of folk, rock, French chanson, world music, jazz, and classical acts taking the stage throughout the summer. Astropolis . In recent years France has produced some of the world's finest electronic bands and Brest has played an integral part in the scene's development. Every summer for nearly 20 years the city has hosted one of the most anticipated electronic music festivals in the country -- ""Astropolis"" -- a three-day musical feast that takes place in August each year. But there are also plenty of things to do and see outside the summer festival season -- especially if sailing, seafood and marine life are high on your agenda. Oceanopolis . For years Brest has been the European capital of oceanography. According to the University of Brest, more than 60% of France's maritime researchers and engineers have made the city their home, so it's perhaps no surprise that a giant marine pavilion has emerged there. The venue is much more than your average city aquarium; it is an ocean discovery park covering nearly 10,000 square meters, with 50 individual aquariums housing in excess of 1,000 animal species. Through three pavilions dedicated to polar, tropical and temperate marine ecosystems, ""Oceanopolis"" aims to immerse visitors in an underwater universe representing flora and fauna of oceans around the world. There is also a fourth pavilion that houses the temporary exhibitions on marine biodiversity. The current exhibit, titled ""The Abyss,"" is dedicated to the weird and wonderful creatures that hide in the deepest part of our oceans. Castle Of Brest . Once owned by King Richard II of England, the impressive medieval fortress is the city's most important landmark that, by sheer fortune, was spared from destruction during the heavy bombing of World War II. The castle and its ramparts offer stunning views of the city and inside the fortress hides the city's branch of the ""Naval Museum of Paris,"" which retraces 17 centuries of Brest's longstanding naval history. Tanguy Tower . Built on an enormous block of granite, the ""Tanguy Tower"" is a sightseer's favorite, with its medieval turret offering views of the long-winding Penfield river cutting right through the city. The tower is also home to the Brest Museum - where a series of huge dioramas take visitors on a picture journey through the city's origins and development, showcasing life in Brest before it was bombed.","Brest is one of France's most historically significant harbors .
The city is located in the region of Brittany and is steeped in Celtic heritage .

"(CNN) -- U.S. military aircraft and a Coast Guard cutter Saturday searched a large swath of sea for a catamaran and five American sailors that went missing between Guam and the Philippines. The 38-foot Pineapple was last seen January 6 in Guam harbor, officials said. The crew was making the 1,400 mile (2,250-km) journey to the island of Cebu to deliver the vessel, Coast Guard officials said. The crew is experienced and well-provisioned, but the craft has no long-range emergency communications equipment and faced challenging winds during part of the journey, officials said. The four unidentified men and one woman are friends and have taken sailing classes, said Coast Guard Lt. Gregg Maye, command center supervisor in Guam for search and rescue. ""The experience level gave us confidence,"" Maye said of the crew. ""The master has made voyages like this before,"" he said of the captain of the vessel, which has a white hull and white sails. U.S. forces are searching 60,000 square miles of the Philippine Sea, and the Philippine coast guard is searching its islands, Maye told CNN. Two Coast Guard C-130 Hercules aircraft, a Navy P-3 Orion, a U.S. Navy H-60 Seahawk helicopter, an Air Force C-12 aircraft and the cutter Sequoia are leading the search effort. The Republic of Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia have allowed the United States to use their airfields, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Pineapple's crew was expected to arrive at the central island of Cebu around January 16. ""They were well-stocked,"" Maye said. ""They took plenty of water and provisions."" And people who have been on the sailboat said it was in good condition and seaworthy. Winds and currents were mostly favorable, but the 30-knot winds on part of the journey are troubling. ""Rigging and sails can get fouled. That's why we are concerned,"" the lieutenant said. Officials don't believe the double-hulled vessel carried a satellite phone or distress radio beacon, Maye said. The crew has a hand-held radio with a range of a few miles. The captain apparently told someone the trip would take seven to 10 days, but it can take longer, Maye said. ""We would have expected for them to make the journey in two weeks."" On Tuesday, a relative contacted authorities, who began an investigation. And on Wednesday, the Coast Guard requested the use of the C-130s, which had to be flown from Hawaii, refueled and prepared for the aerial search, which began Saturday morning. One is being flown from Guam, the other from the island of Yap. The Coast Guard is using current and vessel drift models to determine the ""optimal search area,"" Maye said. Broadcasts to commercial vessels have not yielded any sightings, the Coast Guard said. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","The Pineapple left Guam on January 6 for the Philippines .

"(CNN) -- A giant freighter disabled in high and frigid seas near Alaska's remote Aleutian Islands could be under tow by late Saturday, officials said. The 738-foot Golden Seas, with a full load of canola seed, suffered engine problems Friday morning and was chugging along at only 3 knots (3.5 mph). The 20-member crew and rescue officials were concerned about it running aground on Atka Island, but weather conditions have improved, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The Golden Seas was about 50 miles north of the island late Saturday afternoon. Winds in the 40- to 50-knot range were expected to fall to 30 knots (35 mph). ""The safety of the crew is paramount. At the current time they are not in any danger,"" Jeremy Michels, responsible party incident commander, said in a teleconference. The vessel, owned by the Greek company Allseas Marine, was traveling from Vancouver, British Columbia, to the United Arab Emirates. Besides the seed, the Golden Seas has more than 450,000 gallons of crude oil, 11,700 gallons of diesel and 10,000 gallons of lube oil on board, the Coast Guard said. A tow vessel were expected to arrive late Saturday and the Coast Guard cutter Alex Haley will be on scene Sunday morning. Plans call for the Golden Seas to be towed to Dutch Harbor, about 270 miles away. The operation will be challenging because of high seas, officials said. If it goes as planned, the Golden Seas could reach port by Monday morning. The Golden Seas got a respite from punishing seas Friday when waves dropped from 29 feet to 20 feet, ""allowing the crew to utilize limited engine capability to maneuver northeast away from land,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement. Seas were expected to be at between 16 feet and 20 feet Sunday. Helicopters aided the effort to keep the freighter from drifting southeast and running aground on Atka, part of the Aleutian Islands in the Bering Sea. Concerns about the vessel running aground and spilling oil subsided Saturday, said Gary Folley of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. The state and U.S. Coast Guard are conducting a risk assessment of rescue operations in the region, said Folley. The study will include a look at possible funding to add more rescue tugs on the islands. ""It is enough to have [one] rescue tug in Dutch Harbor?"" Folley asked.

"Washington (CNN) -- A judge's claim that she was ordered to always rule in the U.S. Coast Guard's favor in cases against civilian mariners cannot be substantiated, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general concluded Tuesday. The inspector general also concluded that the judge's two-year delay in coming forward with the allegation casts doubt on her veracity. Inspector General Richard L. Skinner's 53-page report is a nearly complete victory for the Coast Guard's administrative law judge program, which hears cases brought against merchant mariners, and a repudiation of retired Administrative Law Judge Jeffie J. Massey, who claimed the system was rigged in the Coast Guard's favor. Massey, a judge from July 2004 until March 2007, said in a court affidavit and later testified before Congress that Chief Administrative Law Judge Joseph N. Ingolia specifically told her in 2005 that she should always rule for the Coast Guard. Massey also said comments by fellow judges buttressed her belief that the Coast Guard should prevail on all cases. ""I was specifically told that I should always rule for the Coast Guard and that it I ever found myself faced with a circumstance when I just absolutely, positively could not find anyway to rule in favor of the Coast Guard on any issue, that I should rule against them, but word it delicately and just apologize for it as much as I could,"" she said. But the DHS Inspector General's Office concluded Tuesday that, ""There is no evidence supporting... Massey's claim except her own statement."" Massey's brief employment at the Coast Guard ""was rife with conflict"" and there was a ""growing distrust"" between her and colleagues, the report says. ""These factors likely contributed to ... Massey's belief that (her boss) and others were engaging in misconduct and pressuring her to rule against mariners,"" it says. Massey's allegations roiled the administrative law judge's office of the Coast Guard and sparked an investigation by the Baltimore Sun into the Coast Guard's judicial system. The newspaper reported that mariners prevailed only 14 times out of about 6,300 charges brought over eight years. Most of the cases were settled or resulted in guilty pleas without reaching a courtroom, and some were dismissed, but overall Coast Guard prosecutors had a 97 percent success rate, the Baltimore Sun reported. The Skinner report, parts of which are redacted, apparently does not address the numerical findings of the Baltimore Sun. Massey said it was at an April 8, 2005, meeting that Ingolia told her to always rule in favor of the Coast Guard. Ingolia dismissed all but one colleague from the room before making the remark, she said. Massey cited several other reasons she believed she was to have a pro-Coast Guard bias. In one instance, she said, a fellow judge commented about one of his cases, saying, ""If I ruled that way, the Chief Judge would have my job."" In yet another instance, Massey alleged, Ingolia and others engaged in improper conversations about pending cases. But the inspector general's office said it could not substantiate any of Massey's allegations. Both Ingolia and the senior staff member present at the 2005 meeting said Ingolia ""did not say anything that could reasonably be construed as directing ALJ Massey to rule in favor of the Coast Guard,"" the inspector general's report said. ""Instead, they assert that (Ingolia) only instructed her to follow Coast Guard's regulations."" The staffer called Massey's allegation ""a flat lie."" Massey first made her allegation two months after she retired in an affidavit in support of a mariner in a $15 million lawsuit against Coast Guard employees. ""The timing and manner in which Massey made her allegations also undermine the gravity of the allegations,"" the report says.","A judge claimed she was told to always rule for the Coast Guard in cases .
She served in the Coast Guard's administrative law judge program .
An inspector general's report found her claim cannot be substantiated ."
"(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday released recordings of radio communications after this month's collision between a tour boat and a barge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Thirty-seven people were on board the smaller duck boat in the Delaware River on July 7 when the accident occurred. Two people, both from Hungary, were killed. ""Hey ferry, ferry, ferry! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"" an unidentified voice yelled early in the incident, apparently witnessing the collision. A tug boat then called in to a Coast Guard radio center. ""This is Freedom. We got people in the water on Penn's Landing. It looks like they got run over by a barge. One of the duck boats. I am going in to pick 'em up."" ""Roger, captain. How many persons are in the water? Over."" ""No idea. I don't have time to talk to you right now. I am going to get the people."" The Coast Guard radio operator then advised other vessels to assist in the search for the 37 passengers. Duck boat crew members told investigators that they made radio calls to the tug boat Caribbean Sea that were not answered prior to the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board said earlier this month. The Caribbean Sea was pushing the barge that collided with the tour boat, causing it to sink in 55 feet of water, the report said. The skipper of the Caribbean Sea can be heard on the recordings, responding to a Coast Guard call. ""We are right here next to the ship Freedom. We are the ones that, I guess, capsized the duck boat. We're on scene just making sure that no one got injured or if we can help in anyway. We do have a barge alongside, so there's not too much we can do."" The Coast Guard radio person then asked him to throw any needed life jackets into the water. One of five crew members of the Caribbean Sea invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to meet with investigators, the safety board said earlier this month. According to CNN affiliate WPVI, these recordings are just some of the many elements federal investigators are reviewing as they probe the circumstances surrounding the collision. They also continue to examine the structural damage of both vessels. The tour boat, the DUKW 34, carried 35 passengers and two crew members when it experienced mechanical problems about five to 10 minutes before the crash, the NTSB report said. That problem led the ship's master to anchor the tour boat. Meanwhile, the Caribbean Sea approached with the barge. Around 2:36 p.m., the bow of the barge hit the small tour boat, causing it to sink, investigators said. People who operated several vessels in the area have told federal investigators that they heard the tour boat's radio calls. The National Traffic Safety Board said it's looking into those accounts.","Coast Guard releases audio communications made after barge-tour boat collision .

"BATON ROUGE, Louisiana (CNN)  -- The governor of hurricane-battered Louisiana said Wednesday that the prospect of some areas of the state being without electricity for weeks, as power company officials have warned, is unacceptable. Mayor Kip Holden, from left, President Bush and Gov. Bobby Jindal visit a Baton Rouge operations center. ""There is no excuse for delay. We absolutely need to quicken the pace at which power is being restored,"" Gov. Bobby Jindal said. Both he and President Bush, who visited the state Wednesday to see areas damaged by Hurricane Gustav, called restoring power the state's priority. ""They've got to get electricity up here in Louisiana,"" Bush said. ""There's a lot of folks from this state that are working hard to restring the lines. I would ask that if utilities in neighboring states have extra manpower, please coordinate with the state and send the folks in.""   Watch Bush discuss Gustav response » . The reluctance of Gustav, now a tropical depression, to leave the area was adding an unwelcome facet to the recovery effort.

""Tropical Storm Gustav, Hurricane Gustav, whatever you want to call it, continues to cause great, great, damage in our state,"" he said. Nearly 1.2 million households and businesses were without power as of late Tuesday, Jindal said, and the lack of electricity ""continues to be the most critical obstacle to the quick recovery of our state.""  Watch how Gustav downed power lines » . The lack of power hindered access to gasoline, the governor said, noting that some gas stations had fuel but no power with which to pump it. As a result, people waited in long lines at many of the functioning gas stations. On its Web site, the state had posted a list of working gas stations.  Watch Jindal say no excuses for aid delays » . Jindal reported four storm-related deaths: two people were killed Tuesday night by tornadoes and two others by carbon monoxide poisoning. He did not identify those killed.

Two or three people attempted to loot a supply truck in Ville Platte overnight and fired upon National Guardsmen, he said. The National Guard returned fire, and the people fled. No one was injured. Many people began returning to Louisiana on Tuesday, including to New Orleans, where Mayor Ray Nagin said people who ""jumped the gun"" by trying to return to the city ahead of the lifting of the evacuation order -- set for midnight -- would be allowed in. Nagin had originally said residents could return home Thursday. ""No one will be turned back if you have an identification that you live in the metropolitan area,"" Nagin told CNN affiliate WWL. ""Now, if you're a visitor and you're coming in ... we're turning them around."" He joked that Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans arriving Wednesday ahead of the team's game against the New Orleans Saints would be especially unwelcome.  Watch residents return home » . ""We don't need them in our stadium anyway,"" he quipped before saying visitors could enter the city Thursday. The mayor advised returning residents to ""keep a level head.""

""The key right now is for everyone to stay calm, deal with the issues as they're presented."" The mayor said Wednesday that a dusk-to-dawn curfew would be relaxed about midnight Thursday to allow people back into the city. The official mandatory evacuation order for the general population will remain in effect until then, said the mayor's spokesman, James Ross. Nagin had planned for a phased return to the city, allowing operators of essential businesses and some residents back Wednesday. Safety and utility personnel began returning Tuesday.
