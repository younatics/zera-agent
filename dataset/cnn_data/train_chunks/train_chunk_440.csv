"The Minnesota Vikings made a mistake. And they want to ""get things right."" The two statements were repeated several times by owners and members of the team's front office during a media day news conference Wednesday, the first 20 minutes of which were dominated by questions about star running back Adrian Peterson, who stands accused of felony child abuse in Texas. ""We made a mistake, and we needed to get this right,"" co-owner Zygil Wilf said. ""Our goal is to always make the decision we think is right."" After Wilf left the podium, a reporter asked Wilf's brother, co-owner Mark Wilf, general manager Rick Spielman and Kevin Warren, executive vice president of legal affairs, whether the team wanted to apologize to the boy that Peterson is charged with abusing or the boy's mother. There was a brief pause before Mark Wilf said, ""Again, our focus is to get things right, and we support Adrian."" The move to keep Peterson ""away from all team activities"" marked a change in course for the Vikings, which had earlier said that Peterson would practice this week and could play in Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints . Peterson was placed on an exempt list, the team announced early Wednesday, so that he can deal with the felony child abuse charge stemming from the June discipline of his son, whom Peterson has said he never intended to injure. Who put Peterson on the list? While there was some initial confusion as to whether the Vikings placed him on the list or  whether Peterson made the decision, Spielman clarified that at the news conference, explaining that only Commissioner Roger Goodell can place a player on the NFL's exempt/commissioner's permission list. Warren made it a point to emphasize that the discussion about revisiting Peterson's situation began with the Vikings, which conveyed its intentions to the NFL. ""This was a decision made by the Vikings,"" he said. Spielman said he met with Peterson on Tuesday, and while he declined to discuss the specifics of that conversation, he said the running back was ""unselfish"" and wanted to step away to ""give the Vikings an opportunity to focus on football."" Peterson will take a leave with pay until his legal issues are resolved. ""This is a good decision that will allow Adrian Peterson to resolve his personal situation and the Vikings to return the focus to the football field,"" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in an email to CNN. The NFL Personnel Policy explains the designation: ""The Exempt List is a special player status available to clubs only in unusual circumstances. The List includes those players who have been declared by the Commissioner to be temporarily exempt from counting within the Active List limit. ""Only the Commissioner has the authority to place a player on the Exempt List; clubs have no such authority, and no exemption, regardless of circumstances, is automatic. The Commissioner also has the authority to determine in advance whether a player's time on the Exempt List will be finite or will continue until the Commissioner deems the exemption should be lifted and the player returned to the Active List."" In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said his client wanted to continue to contribute to his team and the community, but that was possible only by resolving his case through the legal system and not ""the court of public opinion."" ""Ultimately, it will be up to a judge and jury to decide this case, which is the way it should be. Ours is the greatest legal system in the world, and Adrian is confident that a just result will emerge once all the facts are presented,"" the statement said. Decision rescinded . Though the team deactivated him for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots, the Vikings announced this week that Peterson would return to practice and be allowed to play Sunday. It was a short-lived decision, one the team would repeatedly call a mistake Wednesday. ""While we were trying to make a balanced decision (Monday), after further reflection we have concluded that this resolution is best for the Vikings and for Adrian,"" said the Wednesday statement from the Wilf brothers.  ""We want to be clear: We have a strong stance regarding the protection and welfare of children, and we want to be sure we get this right."" Peterson is considered one of the best running backs in the NFL -- if not the best. His absence was probably felt during the Vikings' 30-7 loss to the Patriots on Sunday. In 2011, the Oklahoma University product agreed to a lucrative contract, which NFL.com reported would be worth $100 million over a seven-year period. But his fortunes have taken a turn for the worse since his indictment last week on a felony charge of causing bodily injury to his son. On Tuesday, he lost one of his most significant endorsement deals when Castrol, a major producer of motor oil, pulled out. Castrol used Peterson in commercials for its Edge performance oil product and on social media. Many recent social media posts of his likeness have been pulled down, and the commercials are no longer available on YouTube. His other major sponsor, Nike, said late last week it would stand by its athlete for the time being. One of the team's sponsors, the Radisson hotel chain, announced Monday night that it was suspending its ""limited sponsorship of the Minnesota Vikings while we evaluate the facts and circumstances."" Also, the website for Peterson's All Day Foundation was taken offline after the charities represented on the site received ""harassing"" calls from gossip sites, said his philanthropic adviser, Bruce Richmond. ""We took the website offline because the charities that Adrian supports were getting calls from the media and were getting harassed by the media,"" Richmond told CNN. ""I spoke to one communication director saying she had received about a dozen calls today from the same gossip site."" The allegations . After his indictment last week, Peterson turned himself in to East Texas authorities Saturday and was released on a $15,000 bond. A preliminary court hearing is scheduled for October 8. According to Texas law, people can be convicted of injury to a child if they cause bodily or mental injury ""intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence"" or cause such harm by omission. The crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $1,000 fine. Photos obtained by TMZ allegedly show Peterson's son's leg covered in marks that could have come from a switch, or thin tree branch. Some of the marks in the photo appeared to have broken the skin. Authorities haven't divulged the details of what led to the charge. But Peterson's lawyer said the ""charged conduct involves using a switch to spank his son,"" explaining that his client did so while doling out discipline much like ""he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas."" Adrian Peterson and the false gospel of spanking . Hardin said that ""Adrian never intended to harm his son and deeply regrets the unintentional injury."" Peterson defended himself Monday, saying he is ""not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser."" The developments came as CNN affiliate KHOU reported this week that Peterson allegedly abused another one of his children -- a 4-year-old son. Sources told KHOU that the mother of the child filed a complaint with Child Protective Services in Texas because she alleged that Peterson beat the child while he was visiting his father at his Houston-area home. According to the report, text messages between Peterson and the boy's mother show that Peterson admitted disciplining the child, but he says the child hit his head on a car seat in the process. The cultural, regional and generational roots of spanking . No charges were ever filed, according to KHOU. CNN reached out to Child Protective Services but has not received a response. Hardin said Peterson denied the report. ""The allegation of another investigation into Adrian Peterson is simply not true. This is not a new allegation. It's one that is unsubstantiated and was shopped around to authorities in two states over a year ago, and nothing came of it,"" Hardin said. ""An adult witness adamantly insists Adrian did nothing inappropriate with his son.""","""We made a mistake, and we needed to get this right,"" Minnesota Vikings co-owner says .

"Hillary Clinton takes the top spot on a list of admired living women for the 13th year in a row, according to an annual survey released by Gallup on Monday. President Barack Obama, meanwhile, is considered the most admired living man in any part of the world. When asked to name a woman they've heard or read about and admire, 12% mentioned Clinton, the former secretary of state, New York senator and first lady. Eight percent said Oprah Winfrey, 5% said Nobel Peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai, and 4% said first lady Michelle Obama. Other names mentioned included actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie (2%), former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (2%), Princess Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge (2%), Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts (1%), and former first lady Laura Bush (1%). Clinton, who's considered the Democratic frontrunner if she runs for president in 2016, has also held the top spot in 17 of the past 18 years. Laura Bush was considered the most admired woman in 2001, not long after the 9/11 attacks. In the seven decades that Gallup has been asking the question, Clinton has won the designation more than any other woman, including six times more than former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Obama is also continuing a streak, with this year marking his seventh year in a row as the most frequently mentioned man who people admire most. He was given the designation in 2008 shortly after winning election to his first term. According to Gallup, the U.S. president is almost always mentioned as the most admired man, with only 12 exceptions in the past 68 years. This year 19% said the president's name, while 6% said Pope Francis. Also on the list was former President Bill Clinton (3%), Rev. Billy Graham (2%), former President George W. Bush (2%), renowned neurosurgeon and conservative activist Ben Carson (1%),  Stephen Hawking (1%), Bill Gates (1%), Fox News host Bill O'Reilly (1%), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (1%) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (1%).","Gallup released a survey of most admired living people on Monday .

"Jazz vocalist Gloria Lynne, whose career included dozens of albums and whose signature song was ""I Wish You Love,"" has died, her son said. She was 83. Lynne died Tuesday night at Columbus Long-Term Acute Care Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, of a heart attack. Born in New York in 1929, she sang as a child in church, then won an amateur contest at age 15 at Harlem's Apollo Theater, said her son, P.J. Allen. The prize: $15, $5 of which she lost when her mother slapped the bills out of her hand upon discovering she had entered the contest without telling her. Soon, she was signed by Everest Records. ""But her real break came with Harry Belafonte's 'Strolling '20s,'"" Allen said, referring to the 1966 television special that included Duke Ellington, Sidney Poitier, Nipsey Russell, Sammy Davis Jr. and Diahann Carroll. ""After that, she got the song, 'I Wish You Love,'"" by Charles Trenet. Lynne was also an accomplished writer, said Allen, who cited her autobiography and said she was working on a sitcom to have been called ""Bus Buddies"" at the time of her death. It was ""about the time in her life when she rode a bus, when she was out of the business for a little while,"" he said. ""She met a lot of people, some of whom were very funny."" Though her songs were widely popular, Lynne made her living neither through her writing nor through her nearly 400 recordings, but through live performances, Allen said. ""She got ripped off,"" he said about the recordings. Everest has since closed. Still, the lack of payoff ""never soured her on the business,"" he said. ""She once quoted to me a line from the movie, 'All About Eve.' One of the characters says, 'At least you get applause.' That was always her."" Lynne herself cited the problem in a 2009 interview for the Apollo Theater and Columbia Center for Oral History Collection. ""I have never made any money making records, and I've made a bunch of them,"" she said. But, she added, she always had a response when people would ask her why she continued to sing. ""I said because it was my way of getting music out of me onto the public. Other than that, I wouldn't have anything. If I had stopped and said, 'Well, no, they're not paying me. I'm not going to do any—' I couldn't do that. I couldn't throw away what gift I had because of the money. So God gave me another way. I worked for Bank of America, I did temp work, anything I could do."" Lynne last performed on August 27 at 54 Below in New York, said Todd Barkan, who produced the show and knew her for 40 years. ""She was really a giant of American jazz singing, but she never really got the recognition she so richly deserved, and lived the last 20 or 30 years of her life in relative obscurity,"" he said. ""It's a brutal business and Gloria was a victim of that brutality, for sure. But she was one of our greatest singers, she was a true angel, no doubt about it."" ""Gloria Lynne was one of the great female jazz vocalists & lyricists of our time,"" said blues legend B.B. King. ""She left the world with her beautiful music and will be missed by all the people whose lives she touched.  Gloria was truly a jazz legend."" Publicist Dell Long, who worked for Lynne since the 1990s, said funeral plans were being finalized. ""She lived her song, 'I Wish You Love,'"" Long said. ""She's all about pure love. Her voice never petered. To this day, she sang those original notes like she did in her teens and 20s."" Long added, ""She said when she sang the notes she heard them for the first time.""

"Actor James Avery, who played the beloved Uncle Phil on the hit 1990s sitcom ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"" has died, his publicist said Wednesday. He was 68. The cause of death was complications from open-heart surgery, said his manager, Toni Benson. Avery had surgery on November 11 and died Tuesday evening at a hospital in Glendale, California, according to Benson. ""Fresh Prince"" co-star Joseph Marcell, who played the family butler Geoffrey, told CNN that Avery was ""a marvelous man and a truly wonderful actor."" Avery played Philip Banks, the stern but loving uncle to Will Smith's character on the show. ""He strove to present an Uncle Phil that everybody wishes was their uncle,"" Marcell said. Avery believed the show was important because the ""striving of the African-American ought to have been shown on television,"" Marcell said.  ""What he has done for television, for African-Americans on television is unsurpassable."" ""Fresh Prince"" co-star Alfonso Ribeiro tweeted news of Avery's passing. ""I'm deeply saddened to say that James Avery has passed away,"" Ribeiro wrote. ""He was a second father to me. I will miss him greatly. Jada Pinkett Smith, wife of Will Smith, posted the couple's condolences Wednesday on her verified Facebook page. ""Our condolences to aunt Florence (his mother), Miss Barbara (his wife) and all those who loved him,"" Pinkett Smith wrote. A classically trained actor and poet, Avery grew up in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he was raised by a single mother. He served in the Navy during the Vietnam War and first appeared onscreen as a dancer in an uncredited role in the 1980 film ""The Blues Brothers."" A biography provided by his manager said that after he served in the military, Avery moved to San Diego, California, where he began writing TV scripts and poetry for PBS. Before joining the military, he once said, he had dreams of being like Richard Wright and living in Paris. But life took a different turn. ""I knew I loved the arts,"" Avery said in an interview for the show ""Unscripted."" ""I knew I wanted to be a writer, but the theater was something I had been involved in before."" Avery appeared in multiple TV shows and movies, including ""CSI,"" ""That '70s Show,"" ""The Closer"" and several appearances as a judge on ""L.A. Law."" Indeed, with his deep, mellifluous voice, he frequently played judges, professors and doctors -- Uncle Phil began as a lawyer and eventually became a judge -- and was much in demand as a voice actor. His voice roles included Shredder in the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" series and James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in the 1990s animated series version of ""Iron Man."" He most recently appeared in Zach Braff's new film, ""Wish I Was Here,"" which will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival later this month. But his most famous role was on ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"" which aired from 1990 to 1996. The show, co-executive produced by Quincy Jones and created by Andy Borowitz and Susan Borowitz, cast Smith -- then best known as a rapper -- as a Philadelphia teenager who is sent to live with his wealthy Los Angeles relatives. As Banks, a former civil rights activist and Harvard Law-trained attorney, Avery provided a role model for Smith's sometimes wild character. Avery, too, leveled with youthful audiences, noting in ""Unscripted"" that he left home at 18 because ""I had too good a time."" In a 2007 interview with the New York Film Academy, he was forthright about his abilities. ""You can either be a movie star or an actor. I'm an actor,"" Avery said. ""(But) I've done pretty good."" He is survived by his wife of 26 years, Barbara Avery; his mother, Florence Avery of Atlantic City; and a stepson, Kevin Waters.

"For nearly seven weeks, the American public knew alleged police killer Matthew Eric Frein from a handful of images -- showing a seemingly clean-cut young man, sometimes dressed in a Cold War-era uniform and carrying a gun. But this week, they got a different glimpse of Frein. The bridge of his nose was cut and bloodied. His face was scratched. And he wore an orange jail jumpsuit. The new uniform is because of what happened Thursday, when a team of U.S. marshals took the 31-year-old survivalist and military buff into custody at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, Pennsylvania. As to the suspect's abrasions, Scott Malkowski -- who took down Frein, accompanied by about a dozen other marshals -- told CNN they came about when these authorities tried to detain Frein and avoid the firefight many feared. ""We're not playing around,"" Malkowski said. Capturing a dangerous fugitive . Authorities have acknowledged Frein got special treatment in some ways. After his arrest, he was shackled in the handcuffs of Pennsylvania state police Cpl. Bryon Dickson -- the officer that authorities say Frein killed on September 12 -- put in the backseat of the slain trooper's squad car, then sent back to the barracks where the ambush on Dickson occurred. That's not possible for every accused convict. Opinion: Were cops out of line in trooper-killing arrest? But Malkowski said that Frein wasn't treated differently -- at least differently than anyone on the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List considered armed and dangerous, after having allegedly killed one officer and wounded another before melting into the woods -- while being taken into custody. When authorities approached Frein, the suspect had his chest down on the ground but his head was up looking at Malkowski, the marshal said. From a law enforcement perspective, that is just what you don't want. ""Never have a fugitive look at you,"" Malkowski explained. Per law enforcement protocol, Frein was forced to be face-first on the asphalt looking away from the marshals (so that a suspect can't anticipate an officer's next move). In the process, his nose got cut and his face scraped. ""Sometimes things like that happen,"" Malkowski said. Most-wanted suspect taken into custody . An end to a tense 48 days . The U.S. marshal told CNN affiliate WPVI that his first sign of Frein came in the form of movement through nearby high grass and weeds. ""When I first saw him, I was like, 'What's this guy doing in the field by himself?' "" Malkowski recalled Saturday. ""For a split second, I didn't think it was him. ""But then we had a sixth sense, I guess. I knew it was him."" And so Malkowski and his team of marshals got closer, without the suspect apparently not knowing. Until, that is, Frein turned around and saw the law enforcement officers approaching him. ""I told him to get on the ground...,"" Malkowski said. ""We just kept closing distance (to) about 5 feet away. ""I said, 'Who are you? What's your name?' And he said, 'Eric Frein.' "" So ended the manhunt that terrorized many in northeast Pennsylvania over a tense 48-day stretch -- closing schools, canceling outdoor activities and prompting the halt to hunting and trapping. As many as 1,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers scoured forests and thoroughfares looking for Frein. Normalcy returns to northeast Pennsylvania after manhunt ends . Authorities worried they would get the worst from an armed man with a reported history of police hatred, a man who had lashed out violently before and got away. In fact, while Frein wasn't armed at the time of his capture, investigators later found a cache nearby that included a sniper rifle. The U.S. Marshal team that spotted Frein was well-aware of the worst-case scenarios when they went after him. Yet, Malkowski said, ""That's what the marshals do. We hunt fugitives. That's our job.""","A U.S. marshal recalls the capture of Eric Frein at an abandoned Pennsylvania airport .

"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia says torture -- depending on the circumstances, like if a nuclear bomb was planted in Los Angeles -- isn't necessarily off limits. The justice who's been a mainstay of the high court's conservative wing for 28 years condemned the ""self-righteousness of European liberals"" who oppose torture ""so easily"" Friday in an interview with Swiss National Radio. ""I don't think it's so clear at all,"" Scalia said. ""I think it is very facile for people to say 'Oh, torture is terrible,'"" he said. ""You posit the situation where a person that you know for sure knows the location of a nuclear bomb that has been planted in Los Angeles and will kill millions of people. ""You think it's an easy question? You think it's clear that you cannot use extreme measures to get that information out of that person?"" Scalia also discussed the death penalty, saying he thinks it's ""too bad"" that a campaign in Switzerland to re-institute capital punishment has been thwarted by the the country's membership in the Council of Europe, which has made the issue a requirement for all participating countries. ""What are human rights is not written up in the sky, and if it were written up in the sky, it would not be up to judges, lawyers, just because they've gone to law school, to know what human rights ought to be and therefore are,"" Scalia said. ""And therefore each society's perception of what it believes human rights should be ought to be up to that society, and I think it's very foolish to yield that determinations not only to a foreign body but to a foreign body of judges,"" he said. ""I don't know why anyone would want to do that."" And he brushed off questions about whether Supreme Court decisions opening the door for outside groups to spend unlimited sums of money on elections have hurt the country, saying that ""the amount of money that is spent on all elections -- state, local and federal -- in the United States, is less than what women spend on cosmetics for a year, OK?"" He said the alternative is having Congress impose limits on ""who can speak and how much who can speak."" ""If you think that a fair system of election speech is going to be devised by the incumbent senators and congressmen, you are naive,"" he said. ""They will for sure, as they have in the past, devise a system that favors the incumbent. If that's the choice of evils -- have a system that always favors the incumbent or, you know, let people speak as much as they want with as much money as they want -- I choose the latter. I don't even regard the latter as an evil."" Scalia said he doesn't agree with the notion that outspending the other side is the key to winning elections. He said if people really believe ""the masses are so ignorant that they are swayed by television ads,"" then ""let's have a king. Right? Let's have a king.""","Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia says torture isn't ""an easy question""

"The suspect in the deadly shooting at Belgium's Jewish Museum was extradited from France to Belgium, a French court official said Tuesday. He is Mehdi Nemmouche, arrested in France for the May 24 attack. Nemmouche recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist, French officials said.

"A Dutch architect is thinking a little bigger about 3-D printing than the tiny-to-midsize trinkets we've seen so far. He wants to print a house. And a pretty offbeat and innovative one at that. ""Landscape House"" is the brainchild of architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars. He describes it as ""one surface folded in an endless Mobius band,"" or sort of a giant figure 8.

The house would cost between $5 million and $6 million, according to the BBC, and there's already been interest expressed by museums, private individuals and others, according to Ruijssenaars. He told the network that someone in Brazil plans to buy one to display native art he's found in a nearby national park. All that would be innovative enough on its own.

"Myanmar's government has begun unveiling drafts of proposed laws that critics say are motivated by religious hatred, and could take discrimination against the country's marginalized Muslim minority to new heights. The four bills are based on a petition presented by a group of nationalist Buddhist monks to President Thein Sein in July last year, calling for curbs on interfaith marriage and religious conversions, among other measures. According to the monks, it's a matter of protecting race and religion and encouraging peace. Tensions between the Buddhist majority and Muslim minority in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have been high since deadly violence erupted between the groups in 2012, as the country emerged from decades of authoritarian military rule. A faction of Buddhist nationalists has been criticized, accused of drumming up hostility. The first draft bill -- stemming from a request from a coalition of monks known as the Organization for the Protection of Race, Religion, and Belief -- was published in state media Tuesday, with a call for public comment by June 20. The proposed law would require anyone seeking to change their religion to obtain permission from a number of different local authorities. Targeting Muslims? While the bill applied to all religions, human rights and civil society groups believe it is driven out of a concern to prevent the spread of Islam in the predominantly Buddhist country. ""The objective is against Muslim people,"" said Thin Thin Aung, a member of Women's League of Burma, which belongs to a coalition of women's groups that has campaigned against a proposed bill on interfaith marriage. ""Almost all parts of these bills are aimed to target Muslims -- it's based on hatred against this minority religion."" The draft of the accompanying interfaith marriage law is yet to be released. But Human Rights Watch and other rights groups, who say they have seen the draft proposal, maintain it calls for Buddhist women to be permitted to marry only Buddhist men, requiring anyone seeking to marry a Buddhist to convert to the religion. The suitor would also be required to obtain the written consent of the woman's parents. The proposal also puts forward a 10-year prison sentence for any non-Buddhist who marries a Buddhist in violation of the law, according to Human Rights Watch. Matthew Smith, executive director of rights group Fortify Rights, said that any such law would ""give legislative voice to Buddhist fears of a Muslim takeover. It's patently discriminatory,"" he said. ""The fact that lawmakers in Myanmar are considering a law like this now should serve as a wake-up call to the international community. Anti-Muslim discrimination is reaching unprecedented heights."" But Myanmar's presidential spokesman Ye Htut said that until the draft bill was released, any comment on its content was ""just speculation."" ""The bill committee is considering all the public advice and opinion on their work,"" he said. ""They have to consider articles in the constitution which grant freedom of religion in our country, and consider other international human rights conventions."" Limits on family size . The other related ""race and religion protection"" draft bills scheduled to be released soon included ones proposing a ban on polygamy and limits on family size -- also aimed at curbing Muslim population growth, according to rights groups. Muslims are estimated to account for about 5% of Myanmar's nearly 60 million people. Aung said she feared that the bills, if passed, would lead to further division and violence in the country. ""Our Burmese society is already ethnically and religiously divided,"" she said. ""We're in a very early democratic transition period. It will lead to more prejudice and discrimination."" Mark Farmaner, director of Burma Campaign UK, agreed, saying the laws, if passed, would ""significantly undermine prospects for peace."" ""Ethnic and religious minorities in Burma are already suspicious that the Burman Buddhist dominated central government wants to either assimilate or suppress them,"" he said. ""The interfaith marriage laws play into the greatest fears of ethnic and religious minorities that the government sees the country as a Burman Buddhist country where ethnic and religious minorities are not considered equal."" Aung said her coalition also opposed the interfaith marriage law on the grounds that it impinged on the freedom of women to choose who they married, a retrograde step in a country moving towards democracy, and where there were no existing restrictions on a woman's right to wed. The bill was also unnecessary, she said, in that marriages of Buddhist women and Muslim men did not appear to be commonplace. ""I don't see an alarming number of Buddhist women marrying Muslims,"" she said adding that marriages between Buddhists and Christians were more common, and generally viewed as unproblematic. Crimes against humanity? Rohingya Muslims in parts of the western state of Rakhine are already subject to a controversial ""two-child policy"" that has been criticized by respected Burmese politician and human rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi. Rakhine state has been the site of communal violence between Rohingya and the region's ethnic Rakhine majority, which has displaced tens of thousands of Muslims, forcing them into camps where they are completely reliant on humanitarian aid supplies. In March, Doctors Without Borders -- the largest NGO healthcare provider in Rakhine -- was banned from operating in the state, where it had worked for nearly 20 years, because officials accused it of providing preferential treatment to Rohingya. The developments have triggered a humanitarian crisis, with the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, declaring last month that persecution of the group ""could amount to crimes against humanity,"" and Human Rights Watch labeling it ""ethnic cleansing.""

"(CNN)Charles Koch, the billionaire GOP donor whose money plays a big role in shaping Republican campaign efforts, said he plans to make criminal justice reform a priority of his as the country heads into the next presidential election. ""Over the next year, we are going to be pushing the issues key to this, which need a lot of work in this country,"" Koch, a Kansas native, told the Wichita Eagle in a story published this weekend. ""And that would be freedom of speech, cronyism and how that relates to opportunities for the disadvantaged."" Koch's comments might come as good news to Sen. Rand Paul, who's made sentencing reform a major part of his agenda while he tries to appeal to nontraditional GOP voters ahead of a likely presidential bid. Gov. Chris Christie, who's set to make his 2016 decision in the coming months, has been active in pushing for bail reform in New Jersey. And other prospective Republican 2016 candidates -- including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas — have been supportive of sentencing reform for nonviolent drug offenders. Following the 2012 presidential loss, in which Republican nominee Mitt Romney won only 6% support among African Americans and 27% among Latinos, Republicans have been more vocal about making changes to the criminal justice system for nonviolent offenders -- an issue that resonates deeply within minority communities. Koch, according to the Kansas newspaper, said the criminal justice system needs reform ""especially for the disadvantaged"" as well as changes to make it ""fair"" and to make ""sentences more appropriate to the crime that has been committed."" His chief counsel, Mark Holden, said the tough-on-crime efforts by lawmakers in recent decades have disproportionately affected minorities. ""It definitely appears to have a racial angle, intended or not,"" he said, according to the Wichita Eagle. Holden added that Koch also wants to address voting rights for former offenders and make it easier for nonviolent offenders to find employment after completing their sentences. Campaign observers pay close attention to the political interests of Koch and his brother, David. Political groups associated with the powerful duo spent $100 million on races in 2014. According to the newspaper, Koch's interest in criminal justice reform originated from a lengthy, expensive case defending his company, Koch Petroleum Group, against 97 felony indictments involving alleged environmental crimes at an oil refinery in the 1990s. All but six of the charges were ultimately dropped, and the case ended in a $10 million settlement.","GOP megadonor Charles Koch wants a bigger conversation on criminal justice reform .

"As a teenager, Jejoen Bontinck danced in music videos and was a regular kid hanging out with friends in Antwerp, Belgium. But within a year, he went from a hip-hop-loving teenager to a young Muslim convert, preaching on the streets of Antwerp. His father, Dimitri Bontinck, claims that in 2010, when Jejoen was 15, he became infatuated with a Moroccan girl, which eventually led to him converting to Islam. His parents started noticing a radical change in their son about eight to nine months after the conversion. ""He started to become very religious. He stopped wearing his normal clothes. So we really see the progress of radicalization -- this is the right word -- we really see the signs,"" Dimitri explained. Dimitri says he called the authorities after his son joined a radical Muslim organization in Belgium, but they took no action. ""[They told me] there is no law forbidding a child to be a member of this organization,"" Dimitri says. ""It's freedom of speech. Its freedom of religion. Its freedom of organization."" When Jejoen, still a teenager, asked his parents if he could move to Cairo to study Islam last year, they said yes. But Dimitri knew something was wrong when Jejoen didn't call his sister on her birthday -- and he began to believe that his son wasn't in Egypt at all. Dimitri searched for clues online to where his son really was, and he was shocked by what he found -- videos and pictures of his son's hometown friends in Syria. ""It was Syria this, Syria that. One day I find a video ... of friends of his from Antwerp. So when I saw that, I knew right away -- my son is there,"" he says. So Dimitri, a former Belgian soldier who says he used to work with the U.N., decided to go after Jejoen himself. He took out an ad in a local newspaper asking for volunteers to take him to Syria. In April of last year, a Dutch war reporter agreed to accompany Dimitri to Syria, but their trip turned up few leads on where Jejoen might be. So six months later, Dimitri returned to the war-torn country on his own. Dimitri says it didn't take long before he encountered some of the militants who were fighting to bring down the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Dimitri says he was warned that he would be killed by the Islamists, but instead they took him in. Along the way, Dmitri shot videos of his time in Syria. In one he appears to sympathize with the militants, even parading around with their weapons. ""They took me in and they all respect me,"" he says. ""I was eating with leaders (of these groups) and they pray for me."" ""I have been in Syria and I meet with so many groups like Jabhat al-Nusra ... and I am not Muslim. And when you see what these people have done for me! They arranged for my sleeping and food."" Jabhat al-Nusra, a hard-line al Qaeda affiliate, is one of the most notorious groups operating in Syria today. Dimitri says militants from the group nearly beat him to death. ""They beat me, they almost killed me,"" he says. ""They took all my clothes off. They put a cap on me, they put cuffs on me. And I was almost dead, because always they suspect [I was] CIA,"" he says. But in the end, Dimitri says, they let him go -- and led him to his son, who he says was living with al-Nusra militants at the time. Dimitri gets emotional when describing what it was like to come face to face with his son for the first time inside Syria. ""I never cried before when I was searching for him, when I didn't know anything,"" he says. ""But the first physical contact -- I held him like a small baby. I was really in harmony with him. And he was too. Because he was like a children who has lost his way."" But the saga didn't end when Dimitri and his son boarded the plane home. Police detained Jejoen, now 19, when they landed in Belgium, and charged him with participating in a terrorist organization. Jejoen says he was only there to deliver medical supplies to the group. Jejoen is now at home with his dad, but he is being closely monitored by Belgian authorities as he awaits his trial, which is expected to begin at the end of June. He is barred from speaking to the press. Dimitri insists his son is innocent and says that the Belgian authorities haven't done enough to keep their own citizens safe from extremist groups. Many questions remain unanswered. What was Jejoen's role inside Syria? Was he truly on a humanitarian mission? There are more questions than answers as Jejoen's day in court approaches -- but for both father and son, the journey has transformed their lives forever.","Jejeon Bontinck left Belgium to join militant group Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria last year .

"(CNN) -- Tear gas and pepper spray hung in the air as police in riot gear descended on Keene, New Hampshire, on Saturday night, trying to disperse a rowdy crowd that brought chaos to the city's 24th annual Pumpkin Festival, CNN affiliates reported. ""State and local public safety officials are on the scene and have been working closely together to defuse the situation,"" Gov. Maggie Hassan said a statement. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and provide any assistance necessary to Keene."" Bonfires burned into the early hours of Sunday morning on city streets that were littered with broken beer and liquor bottles, video from CNN affiliate WMUR showed. ""I am saddened and disheartened at the events surrounding this year's Keene Pumpkin Festival,"" said Keene State College President Anne Huot. ""Despite the concerted efforts of organizers, city officials, police, and Keene State College, there continued to be disruptive behavior at parties in multiple locations around the city, injuries, and property damage."" Huot said Keene State students bore some of the responsibility for the unruly behavior, but also suggested that some outside the community had billed the event ""as a destination for destructive and raucous behavior."" Authorities weren't able to provide exact figures, but CNN affiliates reported dozens of arrests and the Southwest New Hampshire Mutual Aid Dispatch Center reported multiple ambulances being sent to the scene. ""I got hit with a Jack Daniel's bottle, like across the face,"" Keene State student Roger Creekmore told WMUR. Steven French, 18, who was visiting from Haverhill, Massachusetts, described the chaotic scene to the local paper, The Keene Sentinel, as ""wicked."" ""It's just like a rush. You're revolting from the cops,"" he told the paper Saturday night. ""It's a blast to do things that you're not supposed to do."" Other young people shouted expletives at police, started fires in the road, pulled down a street sign and apparently tried to flip over a Subaru, the Sentinel said. Because of arrests (140 last year, the Sentinel reported) and injuries at past festivals, the community has held forums in recent years -- inviting police and emergency room doctors as well as residents -- to explore ways to mitigate the violence, vandalism and littering that come with the celebration. The pumpkin festival is a source of pride for the community of 23,000 people about 80 miles northwest of Boston. Last year, the event set a world record with 30,581 lit jack-o'-lanterns, according to the festival's website. ""It's ridiculous. It's not Pumpkin Fest,"" Jacob Gowans, another Keene State student, told WMUR. ""We're supposed to have a fun weekend. This is stupid.""

"Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin snubbed home state Republicans this year, instead endorsing an independent candidate for governor and his Democratic running mate for lieutenant governor. Republican-turned independent candidate Bill Walker posted a photo on Facebook on Thursday of himself, Sarah Palin and his Democratic running-mate Byron Mallott, all of whom are sporting Walker-Mallott pins. ""People and progress over politics,"" the caption reads. Palin hosted an event for Walker and Mallott -- billing themselves as the ""Unity Ticket"" -- in her Wasilla home. Her across-the-aisle endorsement is a jab at incumbent Republican Gov. Sean Parnell, who served as Palin's lieutenant governor when she was the head of the Alaskan state government from 2006 to 2009. Though they worked together for some time, Palin and Parnell have been rivals ever since a policy dispute erupted shortly after Palin resigned from office and Parnell took her place. During her tenure as governor, Palin increased oil taxes in the state, a  revenue generator for Alaska heralded by the 2008 vice presidential candidate as one of her biggest achievements. But Parnell dismantled the tax, causing a divide between the former coworkers. Voters took up the oil tax issue in a state-wide ballot initiative which ended up failing, leaving Parnell's repeal in place. Parnell and Palin, both Republicans, campaigned aggressively during the voter referendum -- on opposing sides. The Alaska governor race is considered a toss-up, with some polls giving Walker a small advantage. And it's unclear whether Palin's endorsement will help Walker: 54 percent of likely voters have an unfavorable view of the former governor, according to a survey from Public Policy Polling last month, a number which has steadily increased ever since she abruptly stepped down five years ago. The same poll shows her favorable rating at a mere 32 percent.","Byron Mallott is a Democrat running for lieutenant governor in Alaska.

"He was simply ""The Man."" Stanley Frank Musial made a name for himself as one of baseball's best hitters of all time on the field, as well as one of its greatest, most dignified ambassadors off it. And now ""Stan the Man"" is gone. Musial died at his Ladue, Missouri, home  surrounded by family, the Cardinals said in a statement. According to a post on his Twitter page, which is maintained by his grandson Brian Musial Schwarze, Musial died at 5:45 p.m. (6:45 p.m. ET) Saturday of natural causes. He was 92. ""We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family,"" said William DeWitt Jr., the club's chairman. ""Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball."" The Pennsylvania-born Musial transitioned from a lackluster pitcher to a stellar slugging outfielder, according to his biography on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's website. The left-hander had a batting average above .300 17 times during his 22-year career -- all played with St. Louis -- and earned three National League Most Valuable Player awards as well as three World Series titles. The only blip came in 1945, in the thick of World War II, when he left baseball to join the U.S. Navy. After the 1963 season, Musial retired with a .331 career batting average and as the National League's career leader in RBI, games played, runs scored, hits and doubles. He has since been surpassed in some of those categories, but he still ranks fourth in baseball history in total hits, behind only Pete Rose, Ty Cobb and Hank Aaron. Hall of Fame manager Earl Weaver dead . He also stood out for his grace and sportsmanship -- having never been ejected once by an umpire. In his retirement ceremony, then-Major League Commissioner Ford Frick referred to Musial as ""baseball's perfect warrior, baseball's perfect knight."" In 1969, Musial was elected on his first try into the Hall of Fame, calling it ""the greatest honor of the many that have been bestowed upon me."" During and after his playing career, Musial developed a special relationship with the St. Louis fan base, who knew him simply as ""Stan the Man."" A bronze statue of him stands outside Busch Stadium, which is located in Musial Plaza along Stan Musial Drive. He continued with the organization for more than 25 years after his playing days ended, serving as vice president and general manager. And Musial was active in the community, contributing to causes such as the USO, the Senior Olympics, the Boy Scouts and Covenant House. ""I have no hesitation to say that St. Louis is a great place in which to live and work,"" he said in his Hall of Fame induction speech. ""We love St. Louis."" His fans returned the favor, revering him for his play as well as his character and commitment to the area. ""Cardinal Nation will never be the same. Rest in peace Stan 'The Man' Musial, the best Cardinal there ever was,"" wrote one woman, by the name of Elise, on Twitter. Musial also stood tall outside eastern Missouri. He served between 1964 and 1967 as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. In 2011, President Barack Obama bestowed upon him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. ""Stan matched his hustle with humility,"" Obama said then. ""Stan remains, to this day, an icon, untarnished; a beloved pillar of the community; a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."" Lillian, Musial's wife of 71 years, died last May -- a longlasting marriage that some people, online, called as admirable as anything that happened on the diamond. Stan Musial's passing spurred an outpouring of condolences and praise. Commissioner Bud Selig described him as ""a Hall of Famer in every sense"" and ""a true gentleman,"" former pitcher Curt Schilling called his life ""a clinic in respect, integrity and honor,"" and current Cardinal Matt Holliday said it was ""an honor to the same uniform."" The messages from fans were no less heartfelt. Wrote Jason Lukehart, on Twitter: ""In a week that's shown the dangers deifying athletes, Stan Musial's death reminds me that once in a great while, there's a man worthy of it."" People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .","Musial played 22 years in the Major League, all with the St. Louis Cardinals .

"(CNN) -- A well-publicized estimate that Typhoon Haiyan killed 10,000 people in the Philippines is ""too much,"" and the death toll likely is closer to 2,000 or 2,500, President Benigno Aquino III told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. ""We're hoping to be able to contact something like 29 municipalities left wherein we still have to establish their numbers, especially for the missing, but so far 2,000, about 2,500, is the number we are working on as far as deaths are concerned,"" he said. The monster storm left behind a catastrophic scene after it made landfall on six Philippine islands last Friday, leaving many without access to food and medical care. At least 800,000 people have been displaced, the United Nations said Tuesday. By Tuesday, Philippines officials said 1,774 bodies had been counted and 2,487 people were injured. The previous estimate of 10,000 killed, Aquino said, came from local officials who perhaps were ""too close"" to the center of destruction to make an accurate guess. The typhoon simply overwhelmed the ability of two or three local governments to do their jobs, which include taking care of the initial response, the President said. For example, in Tacloban, only 20 of 290 police were available when disaster struck; many were tending to their own families, he said. The national government ""had to replace a lot of the personnel with personnel from other regions to take care of government's vital functions,"" Aquino said. The typhoon wreaked havoc on power lines and communications facilities, which meant government officials faced immense difficulties in identifying needs and dispatching relief supplies and equipment. But the situation has improved, he said. All of the national roads are reopened and most of the airports are nearly back to normal operating levels, he said. Still, he added, the sheer number of people affected is daunting. Aquino said the toll might have been higher had it not been for preemptive evacuations, the prepositioning of supplies and cooperation from businesses. ""But, of course, nobody imagined the magnitude that this super typhoon brought on us,"" he said. Aquino expressed gratitude for the aid that has been pouring in from around the world. ""There are, at last count, over 22 countries have either pledged to us, actually given us aid,"" he said. Though civil order has broken down in some areas, some 2,000 personnel have been deployed to restore it, he said. ""People were -- became -- desperate, and that's why we are trying to fast-track the situation where national government takes over these local government functions so that order is restored."" Responding to a question about the vulnerability of his country to climate change, Aquino said he had no doubt that climate change is occurring and the world must respond to it. ""There should be no debate that this is happening,"" he said, citing heavy rains during what used to be dry months, periods of drought during what used to be wet months and the havoc that that has inflicted on farmers. ""We all live on one planet,"" the President said. ""Either we come up with a solution that everybody adheres to and cooperates with, or let us be prepared to meet disasters."" Efforts are under way to better prepare the archipelago nation to endure future such assaults, such as planting mangroves in tidal areas as a defense against tsunamis, and investing in meteorology to better predict -- and prepare for -- such events. After the immediate needs of the populace are met, the nation's focus will turn to rebuilding the tens of thousands of homes affected -- this time to standards better able to withstand typhoons, Aquino said.","""We all live on one planet,"" says Aquino, calling for the world to act on climate change .

"The Syrian regime has used children as human shields and tortured youths whose parents are suspected dissidents, according to a U.N. report. The report on children and armed conflict details accounts of juveniles allegedly abused by pro-government forces and came as a top U.N. official said the conflict in Syria has spiraled into a civil war. ""Yes, I think we can say that,"" U.N. peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous said when asked if Syria is in a civil war. ""Clearly what is happening is that the government of Syria lost some large chunks of territory, several cities to the opposition, and wants to retake control."" Ladsous, who made the remarks to two news agencies, was not available for comment Tuesday because he was traveling. His spokesman Kieran Dwyer confirmed them to CNN, but said what one calls it is not what's important. ""Whether we call it all-out civil war ,whether we call it partial civil war, civil war in some places, the point is that it's hugely escalated, that it's across nearly all parts of the country and that the civilians, ordinary Syrian people, are the ones that are suffering,"" Dwyer said. The U.N. report about children, dated late April, was released Monday by the United Nations. ""Most child victims of torture described being beaten, blindfolded, subjected to stress positions, whipped with heavy electrical cables, scarred by cigarette burns and, in one recorded case, subjected to electrical shock to the genitals,"" the report states, citing dozens of witness accounts. ""Children were detained and tortured because their siblings or parents were assumed to be members of the opposition or FSA, or they themselves were suspected of being associated with FSA,"" a reference to the rebel Free Syrian Army. Dozens of children between ages 8 and 13 were reportedly used as human shields by pro-regime forces during a raid on the village of Ayn l'Arouz in March, the report says. It includes allegations that rebel forces such as the Free Syrian Army recruited and used children, despite the FSA's stated policy of not recruiting anyone younger than 17 years of age. Free Syrian Army officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Mark Lyall Grant, British ambassador to the United Nations, said the U.N. report's findings were ""very disturbing"" and will be looked at ""carefully by all members of the Security Council.  But it's just yet another chapter in the barbarity that is being imposed by the Syrian regime on its own civilian population. ""So to be honest, we are not surprised by the report, but it is still an abhorrent example of how far beyond the pale of humanity the Syrian regime has gone."" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has long blamed violence in the country on ""armed terrorist groups."" The country on Tuesday lashed out at the United States. A report from the state-run news agency SANA cited an ""official source"" at the Syrian Foreign Ministry saying ""that the U.S. administration is continuing its blatant interference in the internal affairs of Syria, its open support for terrorists, covering up terrorists' crimes, distorting facts about Syria at the U.N., and extorting countries and the international community to beleaguer Syria."" A human rights group has implored the U.N. Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Syria. Human Rights Watch said the council should impose targeted sanctions such as asset freezes and travel bans on Syrian leaders. Citing the Syria Violations Documentation Center, a network of Syrian activists, the group said at least 1,176 children have been killed since February 2011. After 15 months of bloodshed, the conflict shows no sign of letting up, as regime forces continue shelling cities across the country, opposition activists say. At least 60 people were killed Tuesday, including many children and women, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Sixteen of the deaths occurred in Deir Ezzor, 23 were in Homs and 12 were in Aleppo, the group said. A family of six, including an infant, was killed in Anadan, in Aleppo province, when a shell landed on their home, the LCC said. Residents of the pro-government town of al-Sheer, near al-Haffa, prevented U.N. observers from reaching al-Haffa on Tuesday by laying down on the road though their town, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria said in a statement that observers trying to reach al-Haffa, in Lattakia province, ""were confronted with angry crowds that surrounded their vehicles, stopping them from proceeding any further. The crowd, who appeared to be residents of the area, then hurled stones and metal rods at the U.N. vehicles."" ""The U.N. observers turned back.  As they were leaving the area, three vehicles heading towards Idlib were fired upon. The source of fire is still unclear."" The observers returned to their bases ""and are secure,"" the U.N. statement said. The mission had been trying to reach al-Haffa since Thursday but has been impeded by ongoing violence in the area, the statement said. U.N. and U.S. officials have expressed concerns about reports that the government was using mortars, helicopters and tanks against the opposition in al-Haffa. They've also expressed concerns that residents  might be trapped. A banner on state TV said some residents in Lattakia province ""tried to explain to members of the observers' mission their suffering from terrorist groups, but the observers did not listen to them. Instead, one of their cars hit three citizens,"" two of whom were in critical condition. Ladsous spokesman Dwyer called the firing on peacekeepers' vehicles ""deliberate and direct,"" and said U.N. officials were evaluating whether the 300 unarmed peacekeepers in Syria are safe enough to continue their activities. ""We're looking at all situations,"" he said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concern Tuesday about reports that Russia may be sending attack helicopters to Syria.  Speakinng at an event in Washington, Clinton said the United States has confronted Russia about stopping its arms shipments to al-Assad's regime. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States has been ""pushing the Russians for months to break their military ties with the Syrian regime and they haven't done it.  And instead they keep reassuring all of us that what they are sending militarily to Syria can't be used against civilians.  And now what are we seeing?  We are seeing the Syrian government using helicopters to fire on their own people from the air."" Deputy Secretary of State William Burns will talk with a Russian official to discuss Syria at an economic meeting Thursday in Kabul, the State Department said. Clinton said that there appears to be no easy solution for ending the bloodshed in Syria. ""We are approached on a regular basis by representatives of different groups within Syria who are terrified of what comes next,"" she told an audience at the Brookings Institution. ""So, how we manage a political transition -- assuming we could manage a political transition -- how we provide reassurance and some level of protection to Christians, Druze, Alawites, Kurds, Sunni business leaders and the like; how we prevent a massive inflow of refugees across the Jordanian and Turkish borders; how we protect Lebanon from getting caught up in the sectarian divides that afflict them as well as Syria.  If these questions had self-apparent and actualizing answers, I would certainly share them with you."" Meanwhile, Syria said an ""armed terrorist group"" attacked the state-run al-Ikhbaria TV channel in al-Haffa in ""an attempt to stop national media from conveying the truth."" The group opened fire on a car, and ""al-Ikhbaria correspondent Mazen Mohammad was hit in his hand while cameraman Fadi Yakoub was hit in his chest,"" state-run news agency SANA reported. SANA reported that 36 ""martyrs from the army and law enforcement forces"" were buried Tuesday. The latest reports of violence came a day after government forces fired indiscriminately from helicopters on a town on the outskirts of Jabal Al-Zawiya, inflicting scores of casualties among civilians and rebel forces, an activist told CNN.

"Hong Kong (CNN)The most powerful storm of the year has Japan in its sights. Hot on the heels of Typhoon Phanfone, which lashed Japan with rain and high winds last week, Vongfong, which has intensified in recent days to become the strongest tropical cyclone of 2014 so far, looks poised to buffet the country in the coming days. Typhoon Vongfong is the strongest tropical cyclone since last year's Typhoon Haiyan, which had winds of 315 km/h (195 mph) which devastated parts of the Philippines, leaving over 6,000 dead and more than 1,800 missing. Track the typhoon . Currently over open water, the storm, which is classed as a Super Typhoon, is heading north towards the Japanese island prefecture of Okinawa, according to the Hawaii-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The Center has recorded sustained winds of 155 knots (178 mph) and gusts up to 190 knots (219 mph), with wave height reaching 50 feet.  It is expected to intensify to 305 km/h (190 mph) in the coming hours. Sustained winds of over 150 mph classify a tropical storm as a super typhoon. Vongfong is the sixth Pacific storm to be so designated this so far in 2014, but is the strongest this year. It is traveling west-northwest at a speed of 8 knots (9 mph), the Japan Meterological Agency said. The agency has classed the storm as ""violent."" Before veering northwards, the storm passed by the Pacific island of Guam, depositing heavy rain and causing minor damage. If it stays on course towards Japan, it is expected to lose intensity before making landfall on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. It could, says CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri, still be a category three equivalent on the U.S. scale. This year has seen a lower-than-average number of named storms and typhoons, but double the yearly average of Super Typhoons - six in total so far. The previous severe weather alert, generated by Phanfone, caused more than 1.2 million people to be evacuated to shelters, disrupted air and rail travel as well as the search and rescue efforts for missing hikers on Mount Ontake. Two U.S. airmen and a Japanese surfer remained missing Monday.","Strongest typhoon of 2014 headed towards Japan .

"""'God is great,'"" the Taliban militants shouted as they roared through the hallways of a school in Peshawar, Pakistan. Then, 14-year-old student Ahmed Faraz recalled, one of them took a harsher tone. "" 'A lot of the children are under the benches,' "" a Pakistani Taliban said, according to Ahmed. "" 'Kill them.' "" By the time the hours-long siege at Army Public School and Degree College ended early Tuesday evening, at least 145 people -- 132 children, 10 school staff members and three soldiers -- were dead, military spokesman Gen. Asim Bajwa said. More than 100 were injured, many with gunshot wounds, according to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province Information Minister Mushtaq Ghani. The death toll does not include the terrorists who attacked the school, bursting into an auditorium where a large number of students were taking an exam and gunning down many of them within minutes, Bajwa said. ""They started shooting indiscriminately,"" Bajwa said, ""and that's where maximum damage was caused."" Pakistani Taliban spokesman Mohammed Khurrassani said the militants scaled the school's walls around 10 a.m. (midnight ET), intent on killing older students there. The Taliban had ""300 to 400 people ... under their custody"" at one point, said Khurrassani, whose group is called Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.  But Bajwa said there was no hostage situation, as the attackers' focus was shooting to kill rather than taking captives. They were eventually met by Pakistani troops who pushed through the complex building by building, room by room. By 4 p.m., they'd confined the attackers to four buildings. A few hours later, all the militants -- seven of them, according to Bajwa -- were dead. Pakistani authorities spent Tuesday night inside the school in Peshawar, a city about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the country's capital, Islamabad, looking for survivors, victims and improvised explosive devices planted to worsen the carnage. As they searched, they discovered that the school's principal was among the terrorists' victims. The attack drew sharp condemnation from top Pakistani officials, who vowed that the country wouldn't stop its war against the Taliban. ""We are undeterred. ... We will not back off,"" Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told CNN. But he said the ambush at the school is another example of how great his nation's sacrifices have been in fighting that's raged for more than a decade. ""Even the children are dying on the frontline in the war against terror,"" he said. ""The smaller the coffin, the heavier it is to carry. ... It's a very, very tragic day."" What do the Pakistan Taliban want? Minister: Most of the dead were 12 to 16 years old . On a typical day, the Army Public School and Degree College is home to about 1,100 students and staff, most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar, though others attend as well. Their nightmare began in late morning, when a car exploded behind the school. Pakistani education minister Muhammad Baligh Ur Rehman explained to CNN that the blast was a ruse, meant to divert the attention of the school's security guards. It worked. Gunmen got over the walls and walked through where students in grades 8, 9 and 10 have classes and fired randomly, said Dr. Aamir Bilal of Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital, citing students. They came in with enough ammunition and other supplies to last for days and were not expecting to come out alive, according to a Pakistani military official. Seventh-grader Mohammad Bilal said he was sitting outside his classroom taking a math test when the gunfire erupted. He fell into bushes before running to the school's gates to safety. Ahmed, the 14-year-old student, remembered being in the school's auditorium when four or five people burst in through a back door ""and started rapidly firing."" After getting shot in his left shoulder, the ninth-grader lay under a bench. ""My shoulder was peeking out of the bench, and somebody was following,"" Ahmed recalled. ""They went into another room, (and when) I ran to the exit, I fell."" Bajwa told reporters that Pakistani security forces reached the school 15 minutes after the attack began. They found, he said, ""the children ... drenched in blood, with their bodies on top of each other."" Most of those killed were between the ages of 12 and 16, said Pervez Khattak, chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is the capital. But some adults in the school also were targets, like a 28-year-old office assistant who was shot and then burned alive, police official Faisal Shehzad said. Obama: Pakistan attack shows Taliban 'depravity' Violent past . Pakistan has seen plenty of violence, much of it involving militants based in provinces such as South Waziristan, North Waziristan and the Khyber Agency -- all restive regions in northwest Pakistan near Peshawar along its border with Afghanistan. It is the home base of the TTP, an organization that has sought to force its conservative version of Islam in Pakistan. The group has battled Pakistani troops and, on a number of occasions, attacked civilians as well. Peshawar, an ancient city of more than 3 million people tucked right up against the Khyber Pass, has often found itself in the center of it all. Militants repeatedly targeted the city in response to Pakistani military offensives, like a 2009 truck bombing of a popular marketplace frequented by women and children that killed more than 100 people. And the Taliban hasn't hesitated to go after schoolchildren. Their most notable target is Malala Yousafzai, who was singled out and shot on October 9, 2012 as she rode to school in a van with other girls. The teenage girl survived and, last week, became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to promote education and girls' rights in Pakistan and beyond. Yousafzai was ""heartbroken by this (latest) senseless and cold blooded act of terror in Peshawar,"" saying Tuesday that ""innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this."" ""I call upon the international community, leaders in Pakistan, all political parties -- everyone -- (to) stand up together and fight against terrorism,"" the 16-year-old added in another statement. ""And we should make sure that every child gets a safe and quality education."" Growing up scared in Peshawar . Taliban: Revenge for killing of tribesmen . Still, even by Pakistan and the Taliban's gruesome standards, Tuesday's attack may be the most abominable yet. This is the deadliest incident inside Pakistan since October 2007, when about 139 Pakistanis died and more than 250 others were wounded in an attack near a procession for exiled former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, according to the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database. Even the Taliban in Afghanistan, with which the TTP is closely affiliated, criticized the ""deliberate killing of innocent people, women and children (as being) against Islamic principles"" and expressed condolences to the attack's victims, according to spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. It comes after peace talks between the Pakistan Taliban and Pakistan's government as recently as last spring.  The government released 19 Taliban noncombatants in a goodwill gesture, in fact. But talks broke down under a wave of attacks by the Taliban and mounting political pressure to bring the violence under control. Inside militants' secret tunnels in Pakistan . In September 2013, choir members and children attending Sunday school were among 81 people killed in a suicide bombing at the Protestant All Saints Church of Pakistan. A splinter group of the Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility, blaming the U.S. program of drone strikes in tribal areas of the country. And for the past few months, the Pakistani military has been conducting a ground offensive to clear out militants, spurring violence that's displaced tens of thousands of people and sparked deadly retaliations. Khurrassani, the Pakistan Taliban spokesman, told CNN that the latest attack was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen during repeated army operations in provinces including South Waziristan, North Waziristan and the Khyber Agency. The TTP spokesman challenged that ordinary citizens were targeted, saying that five army vehicles are routinely stationed at the school. ""We are facing such heavy nights in routine,"" Khurrassani said, rationalizing the siege shortly before it ended.

"Republicans woke up Sunday to a wave of new polls that showed their Senate candidates surging ahead in key states -- including one in Iowa that looked particularly grim for Democrats -- giving the GOP a jolt of enthusiasm going into the 2014 campaign cycle's final hours. Two days from the midterm election, Washington's political class was buzzing around news that Iowa GOP Senate hopeful Joni Ernst was  7 percentage points up in a Des Moines Register poll, and Republican candidates and surrogates popped up on the Sunday news shows, gleeful about their prospects. ""I think the wind is at our back,"" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" He added that Republicans will ""in all likelihood"" win control of the Senate and added: ""I think people are ready for new leadership."" Fueling the Republicans' optimism was a Register poll that showed Ernst leading Democrat Bruce Braley, 51% to 44% -- prompting pollster J. Ann Selzer to tell the newspaper that ""this race looks like it's decided."" Hours before the poll's release, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spelled out what a loss in the Hawkeye State would mean for Democrats. ""Iowa is critical. There's no other way to say it,"" Reid said Saturday in a conference call with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ""Joni Ernst would mean â€” coming to the United States Senate â€” that Mitch McConnell would be leader of the United States Senate, who agrees with her on everything,"" he said, according to Politico. And it wasn't just Iowa that had good news for Republicans. A new set of NBC News/Marist polls unveiled Sunday morning gave Republicans boosts in three key Senate races -- including McConnell's in Kentucky, as well as Georgia, where Democrats had hoped to pickup a seat, and Louisiana, where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in a tough race for her political career. Those incumbent Senate Democrats have spent the fall trying to distance themselves from President Barack Obama, whose floundering state-level approval ratings have been a drag for his party down the ticket as Republicans tie their opponents to the commander-in-chief every chance they get. ""This is really the last chance for America to pass judgment on the Obama administration and its policies,"" former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Of course, polls are no guarantee for how elections will turn out on Tuesday, as the past several elections for midterms and the presidential race were dogged by major network surveys that turned out to be very different from the actual results. And Democrats cite the 2010 example of Colorado where Republican Ken Buck was consistently polling ahead in the final weeks of that race, only to be defeated by now Sen. Michael Bennet. Democrats swung back on the Sunday shows as well to make the case that their early voting numbers suggest they'll hold onto some of those seats. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said on ABC's ""This Week"" that her party's candidates will benefit from get-out-the-vote efforts targeting people who supported Obama in 2008 and 2012, but didn't vote in the 2010 midterm elections. ""We have a ground game that I know [RNC chairman] Reince [Priebus] would take ours over theirs any day of the week,"" she said. She also pointed to Democratic surrogates -- including former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden -- and said they trounce GOP surrogates like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But Priebus shot back that ""our ground game is whipping their ground game."" ""Look, if Americans who want change vote on Tuesday, the Democrats are going to have a terrible night. We're going to have a great night,"" he said. ""And it's because Barack Obama's policies and Debbie Wasserman Schultz's policies and Harry Reid's policies are on the ballot."" The GOP needs to pick up six seats to win a Senate majority, and with several other victories all but guaranteed, losses in swing states like Iowa could seal Democrats' fate. Senate Republican leader McConnell is ahead of Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, 50% to 41%, according to an NBC News/Marist survey released Sunday. Democrats had hoped the contest would be among their few chances to pick off a GOP-held seat or at least divert resources from other key Senate races. Another of those targets is Georgia, but the Republican nominee there, David Perdue, has jumped to a 48% to 44% lead over Democrat Michelle Nunn, the NBC News/Marist survey found. That lead might not be enough to clench that race. To win in Georgia, candidates must earn more than 50% of the vote -- and if neither Perdue nor Nunn are able to reach that mark, they'd face each other again in a run-off election in January. In Louisiana, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in trouble, too. The NBC News/Marist poll found her at 44% support, but in the state's ""jungle primary"" she's facing two Republicans -- Rep. Bill Cassidy and tea party candidate Rob Maness. If Landrieu falls short of 50%, she'd face just one of those Republicans in a December run-off -- and without conservatives' votes being split, she'd be the underdog. The GOP is all but certain to win seats now held by retiring Democrats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. They're also favored in Alaska, Arkansas and Louisiana -- states consistently won by Republican presidential candidates. Wins in swing state targets like Iowa, Colorado, North Carolina and New Hampshire would offer a huge boost to Republicans' chances -- and would insulate the party from potential losses in Georgia and Kansas, where independent challenger Greg Orman hasn't said who he'd caucus with and therefore can't be considered a reliable supporter of either party. Top Democrats, trying to narrow the gap, hit the trail Sunday, including Bill Clinton, who planned four stops in Arkansas -- where Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is endangered and long-time Clinton foil Asa Hutchinson is expected to win the governor's race. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, was in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Gov. Maggie Hassan are both facing stiff challenges in their re-election bids. She'll also attend the funeral for long-time Boston mayor Tom Menino. Obama, who's stayed away from most Senate races this year with the rare exception of a Saturday visit to Michigan on behalf of Democratic candidate Gary Peters, is in Connecticut Sunday to campaign for Gov. Dannel Malloy. Republicans are flocking to Kansas, where Orman is threatening to unseat Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. The party's 1996 presidential nominee, Bob Dole, and former Sen. Rick Santorum are campaigning for Roberts on Sunday. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a likely 2016 White House contender, is swinging through South Carolina, Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Another potential presidential candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, is with Republican Dan Sullivan in Alaska, trying to help the Republican knock off first-term Democratic Sen. Mark Begich. The Florida governor's race -- one of the nation's tightest -- is also getting the attention of big names in both parties. Biden is campaigning for the Democratic candidate, Charlie Crist, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is making stops with Republican Gov. Rick Scott.","Polls from the Des Moines Register and NBC News had good news for Republicans .

"The Pennsylvania attorney general's office is blaming a former state prison clerk for her own rape, in response to a federal lawsuit the woman filed. The 24-year-old typist was working at the state prison at Rockview in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, when she was attacked in 2013. She was choked unconscious and raped for 27 minutes by inmate Omar Best, who had been convicted three times previously of sex-related crimes, and then been transferred from a different state prison for assaulting a female assistant there. ""Despite this knowledge, defendants ... still allowed Omar Best to have unsupervised access to the offices of female employees,"" according to the lawsuit, which also blames the state for the rape. In fact, the lawsuit says that the prison superintendent actually moved the clerk offices from a secure floor where there was no inmate contact to a location that was on a cell block. ""There were no locked doors between the offices and cell blocks, including Block C where (the victim) worked, except for the copy room,"" the lawsuit states. Even though Best was convicted of the rape in May and a review of the prison found multiple failings and led to the superintendent's removal, a senior deputy attorney general wrote that the woman ""acted in a manner which in whole or in part contributed to the events"" in his response to her lawsuit. It's victim shaming at its worst, the woman's lawyer told CNN. ""Worse than that, it's an attempt to embarrass the victim,"" said Clifford Rieders, a Williamsport, Pennsylvania, attorney. The state attorney general's office at first declined to comment when the matter was reported by the Centre Daily Times, in State College, Pennsylvania. Wednesday, the office released a statement saying that it is required to present all possible defenses and ""contributory negligence is one such defense."" In the statement provided to CNN, the attorney general's office said, ""This initial filing should not necessarily be interpreted as meaning this defense will be pursued throughout the entire case,"" adding that elected Attorney General Kathleen Kane was not aware her senior deputy included that defense in his filing. ""Attorney General Kane is disappointed that she was not made aware of this matter prior to the filing, and was saddened to learn that the filing implied that the victim somehow contributed to this crime."" Best is serving a life sentence for the woman's rape. The Pennsylvania state victim advocate said it's hypocritical to use victim-blaming as a defense for the prison. ""I think it's absolutely deplorable to blame the victim in this case,"" Jennifer Storm told CNN. ""It's not common legalese in rape cases,"" Storm said of the AG's defense. ""And it shows a significant lack of sensitivity to not understand the harm this has done to the young woman and the re-victimization she's going through today. ""In a rape case, this is plain victim-blaming."" Opinion: Blame rapists for rape ... obviously . Storm and Rieter both pointed out that the local district attorney, Stacy Parks Miller, who prosecuted Best, whole-heartedly believed the victim. And so did a jury. ""The DA went to bat 100% for this victim,"" Storm said. ""To then backtrack ... it's despicable, I'm disgusted."". ""It's obviously completely inconsistent with the criminal trial,"" Rieter said. ""I think it's bad lawyering. It's what some lawyers do. I don't think it's right, or just, and has no basis here ... There are some people in this day and age who will still do that even though there is no factual or legal basis for it."" According to the suit, Best had been convicted three times prior of sex-related offenses. In 2010, DNA testing linked him to the 1999 abduction and rape of an 18-year-old woman in Philadelphia, and he was sentenced to 7 to 15 years in prison for it. In 2011, he pleaded guilty to rape and robbery in another Philadelphia case and was sentenced to 15 years in state prison. In a 1996 case, he pleaded guilty to indecent assault, after being charged with attempted rape, the lawsuit says. Then, while imprisoned at another facility called Graterford, Best assaulted a female assistant, according to the lawsuit, and was transferred to the state prison at Rockview in Bellefonte, where this victim worked. The victim had complained twice to her boss --  about a week before the attack -- that she felt uncomfortable and unsafe with Best coming into her office. She was assured Best would no longer have access to her office, the lawsuit states. But on July 25, around 8:30 a.m., Best went to her office under the guise of taking out her trash, and grabbed the woman from behind, choking her until she passed out. She tried to blow a distress whistle she carried, but no one heard it. Her lawsuit also claims the prison was understaffed. A prison investigation led to the firing of the superintendent, Marirosa Lamas, the hiring of 70 new corrections officers, and the moving of those offices where she had worked to a more secure space, away from inmates. In the state's response, it denied that the internal investigation was the reason for Lamas leaving. The victim is suing the state Department of Corrections, her former supervisor, the block manager, and the former superintendent, Lamas.

"Jeb Bush was blitzed with questions Thursday about his presidential ambitions in a private session with top South Carolina donors and business leaders, multiple sources at the meeting told CNN. Bush was politely non-committal, as he is in public, but said he was seriously considering the possibility and would make a decision after the holiday season. Bush, brother to one former president and son of another, was also pressed on whether he thought his last name would be a liability in a national campaign. The former Florida governor responded that ""he quit worrying about that a long time ago,"" according to two people in the room. ""He said that everybody has things about them that are positives and negatives, but he said he loves his brother and loves his father, and that every campaign is about telling people who you are,"" said one source. ""He said that my last name is the same, but I am not them. That my job is to show people who I am as a policy maker and a man, and that's the same job everyone else has."" The former Florida governor was in the state, which happens to hold the first presidential primary in the south, for a round of campaigning with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is expected to win re-election next month. Bush has traveled the country raising money for Republican candidates this cycle, but the South Carolina visit marked his first trek to an early primary state as questions about his national ambitions build. Following crowded public events in Greenville and Lexington, Bush headlined a fundraiser for Haley in Columbia that included a high-dollar roundtable with about 30 of the state's top business leaders and Republican officials including Pamela Lackey, the president of AT&T South Carolina, Mikee Johnson, head of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, and former state Attorney General Henry McMaster. In the roundtable — where price of entry was $10,000 — Republicans exchanged pleasantries with Bush about his family before diving into questions about his political future. ""This wasn't a politically agnostic business crowd,"" said one person in the room who did not want to be identified. ""They dialed right in and wanted to get into politics, the horse race of 2016."" Bush, this person said, was ""very engaging, but he was very non-committal about running. He said he has to have joy in his heart to do it. And he said he gets the question wherever he goes."" Ed McMullen, a Republican public affairs strategist in Columbia, said the response to Bush from the donor crowd was ""unbelievable."" ""He said that if I am going to run, I would run because I have a positive vision to take the country forward and unify people and do something that the other people in the race are not talking about,"" McMullen said. ""He had that positive Reagan vision of creating a majority that transcends parties and races and brings people together. I'll tell you what, he makes it very easy to be for him."" At one point, Bush expressed annoyance with the polarizing fights and constant negativity of the political news media — he later said his media diet includes Fox News in the morning, followed by SportsCenter on ESPN — and said he is ""frustrated"" by the toxic climate in Washington. Republicans, though, need to do more than just criticize President Barack Obama, he added.​ . ""He said, 'It's easy to criticize. I turn on the news. I am frustrated. I get the temptation. But that can't be the only reason that people elect you, that you're not the other guy,"" one source at the fundraiser recalled. ""The next Republican has to run about their ideas and what they will do. I get the temptation but that can't be the only reason that people elect you is that you're not the other guy."" Bush told the donors he admires the restraint of his brother, former president George W. Bush, for not criticizing Obama even as the security situation in Iraq deteriorates. ""He talked about how proud he was of his brother,"" said one GOP donor. ""He said, I couldn't do it, but what a class act that he knows it's not his place to come out and publicly criticize the sitting president. He said it's tearing his brother up.""

"A U.S. drone strike targeting al Qaeda suspects in Yemen killed 13 civilians, including three women, three security officials in the restive Middle Eastern country said. ""This was one of the very few times when our target was completely missed. It was a mistake, but we hope it will not hurt our anti-terror efforts in the region,"" a senior Yemeni Defense Ministry official told CNN. The official asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. The United States typically does not comment on reports it has used unmanned aircraft to target terror suspects, but is widely believed to be doing so in Yemen, a key battleground against al Qaeda. More: Suspected U.S. drone strike kills 4 in Pakistan . Families of the victims closed main roads and vowed to retaliate. Hundreds of angry armed gunmen joined them and gave the government a 48-hour deadline to explain the killings, which took place on Sunday. Eyewitnesses said that families attempted to carry the victims' corpses to the capital, Sanaa, to lay them in front of the residence of newly elected President Abdurabu Hadi, but were sent back by local security forces. ""You want us to stay quiet while our wives and brothers are being killed for no reason. This attack is the real terrorism,"" said Mansoor al-Maweri, who was near the scene of the strike. The strike took place near the town of Rada in al-Baitha province on Sunday, Yemeni officials said. A senior Defense Ministry official said the strike initially targeted two members of al-Thahab clan who lead the terror network's operations in the province. He said the militants were in a vehicle near the one that was hit, and fled unharmed. At least 200 suspected al-Qaeda fighters are believed to be hiding in the province. Earlier this year, militants occupied Rada and declared it as an Islamic emirate. But two weeks later, they evacuated the town after authorities released al Qaeda prisoners. Residents are not denying the existence of al Qaeda elements in their region but say that misdirected strikes work in favor of the militant group, helping them recruit new operatives. ""I would not be surprised if a hundred tribesmen joined the lines of al Qaeda as a result of the latest drone mistake,"" said Nasr Abdullah, an activist in the district of the attack. ""This part of Yemen takes revenge very seriously."" The latest attack was the fourth drone strike reported this week. The first three hit their targets, killing at least 12 suspected al Qaeda militants, according to Yemeni officials. Radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in September 2011, is the highest-profile target of an American drone hit in Yemen to date. He was linked to several terror plots, including the shootings at Fort Hood in 2009.","13 people are killed in a strike that missed its target, an official says .

"The National Rifle Association will weigh in on three of this year's key Senate races with a multimillion dollar ad buy beginning Wednesday. The NRA effort is aimed at boosting Republican Senate challengers in Arkansas, Colorado and North Carolina -- the outcomes of which could likely determine which party controls the chamber. The group's campaign is expected to top $4 million in these states, spokesman Andrew Arulanandam confirmed to CNN. It will spend $1.4 million to boost North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis, who is running against incumbent Democrat Sen. Kay Hagan. ""Our Second Amendment rights are under attack by the Obama Administration, and we need leaders like Thom Tillis in the Senate to fight back,"" states the ad. The group will also spend about $1.4 million to run similar ads for Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, who is challenging incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor and about $1 million in Colorado on behalf of Rep. Cory Gardner, running against Sen. Mark Udall. The group also last month launched several multimillion dollar ad campaigns -- one pushing Republican Ed Gillespie, who is up against Democrat Sen. Mark Warner. The other one talks about issues beyond gun rights, trying to reach those who believe the country is on the wrong track as it highlights such issues as the IRS targeting scandal and NSA surveillance. The group also has run ads attacking former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has vowed to spend $50 million of his own money this year pushing for more gun control as he and his group Everytown Gun Safety tries to counter the political influence of the NRA.","NRA wants to help GOP candidates in Arkansas, Colorado and North Carolina .

"The House on Wednesday approved President Obama's request to arm and train Syrian rebels in the fight against ISIS. With significant opposition to the proposal in both parties, the vote was 273 -156. More than one third of the House -- 71 Republicans and 85 Democrats -- voted no. Many Republicans argue the strategy isn't tough enough to defeat ISIS; many Democrats worry the plan could drag the United States into another long military engagement. The proposal would authorize the Pentagon to provide assistance to ""appropriately vetted"" members of the Syrian opposition and require the administration to give Congress a detailed plan for helping the rebels before that assistance could begin. The Senate will vote Thursday on the proposal. Dempsey: U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS, if necessary . House Republican leaders scheduled an extended debate that stretched over two days.  Most measures are only discussed for one hour with only a handful of people participating.  But since so many House members were elected after Congress weighed in on Iraq, close to 100 Democrats and Republicans came to the House floor to explain what amounted to their first vote on an international conflict. It was a debate that highlighted unusual alliances. Conservative Republicans who want more aggressive military action joined progressive anti-war Democrats worried about another U.S. intervention and opposed the measure. But backing the plan were hawkish GOP members and Democrats who argued the proposal to send Syrian groups into the fight against ISIS would send a message to international partners to join the effort. The vote came as an amendment to a spending bill to keep the government funded through mid-December.  It was a vote to grant the new authority to President Barack Obama, but didn't include any new money. The administration has adequate resources for its current airstrike campaign and the program to assist the rebels in an existing fund covering overseas operations.  The measure would let the Pentagon transfer money from that account as needed. Notably, some war veterans on both sides of the aisle argued forcefully against giving the new authority to the President. Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who fought in Iraq, said the goals of the President's plans to arm Syrians were ""unrealistic"" and pointing to Iraq and Libya, said sharply, ""clearly our leaders have not learned their lessons."" California GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, who fought as a Marine in both Iraq and Afghanistan, said that while he did support arming Syrian rebels last year, the sectarian violence has worsened and now he has ""no confidence we are arming the right people."" But another veteran, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, who flew missions over Iraq, warned that not giving this authority would send a worrisome  signal to U.S. allies in the region that are battling the terror group. Others argued this was a time to unite behind the President to show the international community that the United States was moving against terrorism. The third-ranking House Republican, Rep. Steve Scalise, warned ""the threat of ISIS is real and growing and it's not just limited to the Middle East."" The Louisiana congressman said while Congress was giving this authority to the administration, ""there's got to be a give and take,"" and said the provisions added by the GOP would give the legislative body oversight over the new operation with the Syrian moderates. Congress is expected to debate a broader war authorization after the midterm elections.","House approves funding to arm and train anti-ISIS forces in Syria .

"With racial issues and policing headlining the political conversation in America in the midst of nationwide protests and the murder of two police officers in New York, President Barack Obama said he believes the issue of race relations is surfacing ""in a way that probably is healthy."" Obama welcomed the attention race relations and policing in minority communities have attracted recently and said he believes there will be ""progress"" on those issues in the next year as a result of the task force of police, community leaders and activists he assembled this year. ""I actually think that [the U.S. is] probably in its day-to-day interactions less racially divided,"" Obama said in an interview with NPR released Monday and recorded before his family vacation in Hawaii. ""The issue of police and communities of color being mistrustful of each other is hardly new; that dates back a long time. It's just something that hasn't been talked about."" Obama spoke out after two white police officers who each killed an unarmed black man were not indicted by two separate grand juries in recent months, empathizing with protesters and urging them to remain non-violent. But race relations weren't the only topic of discussion when Obama sat down with NPR for a wide-ranging 40-minute interview, in which, he reflected on six years in office and looked forward toward the final two. Obama signaled that 2014 marked a shift in his presidency with the economy showing significant signs of recovery and as the health care law has begun to bear its fruits, calling gains from his administration's policies ""liberating."" Now, Obama can stop putting out the fires and ""focus on some long-term projects"" and consolidating the gains of his first six years in office -- and perhaps his legacy. Obama called his signature health care law a ""big lift with significant political cost,"" but said the country is now seeing ""it's paid off."" And that will be one achievement he will look to defend from a Republican Congress that could define his final two years in the Oval Office. Obama, who said he was ""frustrated"" with the midterm results, said he would look for common ground with Republican legislators, but wouldn't shy away from using his veto power to defend his health care legislation and ""gains that we've made on environment and clean air and clean water"" -- a significant statement given that the next Congress will take up the environmentalist-opposed Keystone XL pipeline project as their first vote next year. The President hasn't yet decided whether he'll veto the pipeline. While Obama flaunted economic gains at home, from deficit reductions to job growth, he also touted American gains in the international arena -- from handling Russia to fighting Ebola. ""Wherever we have been involved over the last several years, I think the outcome has been better because of American leadership,"" Obama said. ""One of the things I've learned over six years -- and it doesn't always suit the news cycle -- is having some strategic patience."" While Obama has taken flak in recent years for being too soft in confronting Russian aggression in Ukraine -- including its annexation of Crimea -- Obama pointed to the ongoing collapse of Russia's economy as a sign of his strategic fortitude. Plummeting oil prices are largely responsible for Russia's nosedive into economic recession, but U.S. sanctions over the last year have also played their part and Obama insisted that those sanctions set the foundation to ensure eventual fluctuations in the oil market would hit Russia hard. Obama said in an interview with CNN this month that his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, is no ""chess master"" and didn't outmaneuver the U.S. as some pundits had suggested. In fact, Obama said he believes the U.S. doesn't' ""really have a serious peer, at least on the conventional level,"" today. The President also reaffirmed his opposition to his predecessor's nation-building policies in Iraq, saying he believes the U.S. ""can help, but we can't do it for them"" in countries like Iraq, Libya and Syria. Sure to learn from the backlash he faced after he likened ISIS to a ""jayvee team"" last January, Obama said the U.S. ""can't underestimate the danger of ISIL,"" but noted that ""it's not the only danger we have"" and said the U.S. should focus on spending money at home rather than committing ""another trillion dollars"" to fighting the militant Islamist group. And with his decision this month to normalize relations with Cuba and establish an embassy in Havana, Obama was asked about another so-called ""rogue"" state that Obama has sought to engage: Iran. So what about an embassy in Tehran, Iran's capital? ""I never say never, but I think these things have to go in steps,"" Obama said, noting that the Cuban decision came after more than a 50-year policy that has failed to change the politics of Cuba. Iran is different, though, Obama said, because it has a ""track record of state-sponsored terrorism"" and has displayed fervently anti-American rhetoric and made ""incendiary"" threats toward Israel. ""There's a lot of history there that's different from the history between us and Cuba,"" Obama said.","Obama said he believes the U.S. is ""less raciallly divided"" today .
And with the economy gaining, Obama said he'll look to focus on ""long-term projects"" in the next year .
He'll also defend his health care law, while working with the GOP to find common ground .
Obama also touted U.S. leadership abroad, and discussed the prospects of an embassy in Iran ."

"It's a decision thousands of protesters feared. China's powerful National People's Congress Standing Committee voted Sunday to change the way Hong Kong picks its chief executive, ruling that only candidates approved by a nominating committee will be allowed to run. A top Chinese official made clear the candidates all must ""love the country and love Hong Kong."" The city's current leader insists it's a step in the right direction. ""The majority of Hong Kong citizens, namely, the 5 million qualified voters of the selection of chief executive in 2017, will be able to cast their votes to select the chief executive,"" said Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. Speaking at an event Monday to explain the NPC's decision, he added: ""This is the first opportunity -- a very good opportunity -- for Hong Kong to have one man, one vote -- universal suffrage. This is something we should all feel proud of."" But that's not how Hong Kong's pro-democracy Occupy Central movement sees it. The group has vocally pushed for elections in which any candidate can run for chief executive. For weeks, protesters have taken to the streets. In a statement on its website, the group slammed Beijing's decision as a move that stifles democracy and blocks people with different political views from running for office. ""Genuine universal suffrage includes both the rights to elect and to be elected,"" the statement said. ""The decision of the NPC Standing Committee has deprived people with different political views of the right to run for election and be elected by imposing unreasonable restrictions, thereby perpetuating 'handpicked politics.'"" Scores of people -- including pro-Beijing groups and pro-democracy supporters -- gathered at the city's AsiaWorld-Expo Monday where the city's decision-makers were meeting. Local media reported chaotic scenes at the conference center as pan-democrats attempted to disrupt an address by Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the NPC Standing Committee. Freedoms eroded . Under the ""one country, two systems"" policy, the 7 million residents of Hong Kong -- defined as a ""Special Administrative Region"" of China -- are afforded greater civil liberties than those in the mainland. This reflects an agreement reached between China and the United Kingdom before the handover, which promised Hong Kong a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years after its return. But the decision to change the way Hong Kong picks its leader comes amid increasing fears that those freedoms are being eroded. Currently, Hong Kong's leader is chosen by an election committee selected mostly by Beijing loyalists. Beijing brushed aside demonstrators' demands for a fully open election in 2017, saying the decision to change the system is in line with Hong Kong's basic law. Protesters demands are self-serving, one top official said. ""Those people's so-called international standards are tailored for themselves,"" said Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee. ""They are not the international standards, but their personal standards."" Civil disobedience . Throngs of pro-democracy protesters rallied in central Hong Kong on Sunday to condemn Beijing's decision and promised there would be more protests. The threat of civil disobedience ""is our bargaining power,"" Benny Tai, the organizer of Occupy Central, told CNN earlier this month. ""They take us seriously, though they will never admit that."" After a massive rally calling for democracy in the Chinese territory in July, hundreds of demonstrators -- including prominent lawmakers -- were arrested. Tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting Occupy Central marched in Hong Kong earlier this month. Local media swirled with reports of marchers getting paid or bused in to attend the pro-government march. The march's organizer said he took the accusations seriously and would investigate but maintained that no laws were broken. 'Paper tiger' But a commentary published Monday by the state-controlled Global Times dismissed this opposition and suggested Hong Kong's political reforms had come to a ""foregone conclusion."" ""The radical opposition camp is doomed to be a paper tiger in front of Hong Kong's mainstream public opinion and the firm resolution of the central government,"" it said. ""These radicals could indeed incite a group of  people to rally with them but they are facing a powerful will and a strong legal framework that Hong Kong must remain stable. They will definitely be called to account if they resort to illegal confrontation. And if they raise objections in a legal way, their efforts will end in vain."" Meanwhile, Fernando Chui Sai-on has been re-elected uncontested as Macau's chief executive. Like nearby Hong Kong, Macau is a ""Special Administrative Region"" of China, following its transition from Portuguese control in 1999. The territory has itself faced calls for greater democracy, though its constitution makes no mention of universal suffrage. A recent unofficial poll on this question was shut down by police and several pro-democracy organizers were arrested for allegedly breaching privacy laws.","Beijing says only candidates approved by a nominating panel can run to lead Hong Kong .

"Democrat Michelle Nunn has a slight 47%-44% edge over Republican David Perdue in the Georgia race for an open Senate seat, according to a new CNN/ORC International survey released Friday. The three-point margin falls within the poll's sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, meaning the two candidates are statistically tied less than two weeks before Election Day. If neither candidate garners 50% of the vote, the race heads to a January runoff. Analysis: Will last minute strength be enough for Dems? Democrats are throwing a lot of money in Georgia, as the party hopes to thwart what's widely expected to be a strong year for Senate Republicans and their quest to take control of the Senate. The GOP needs to win a net six seats to win the majority. Libertarian candidate Amanda Swafford is pulling 5% of the vote in Georgia, keeping Nunn and Perdue from reaching the 50% threshold. Poll: Georgia Senate race statistically tied . A Libertarian candidate is also peeling off votes in Georgia's contested gubernatorial race between Republican incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal and Democratic challenger, Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter. Obama makes push for Nunn on Atlanta radio . The CNN/ORC poll, conducted by telephone October 19-22 with 565 likely voters, indicates Carter has a 48%-46% advantage over Deal, while Libertarian candidate Andrew Hunt gets 6% support. In the Senate race, CNN Director Keating Holland said Nunn's ability to make the race competitive in a reliably red state -- no Democrat has won a statewide election in more than a decade -- is a surprising show of strength. ""The Georgia electorate appears to be the most pro-Obama group of likely voters in the 11 states CNN has surveyed this fall,"" Holland said. ""That's not saying much -- Obama's approval rating among Georgia likely voters is only 44%.  But that's still better than the high-30s he gets in states like Iowa and new Hampshire, not to mention the low 30s in Kansas and Alaska."" Hillary Clinton's midterm campaign schedule . Nunn has a particular advantage over Perdue among likely women voters, 56%-38%, and among likely voters who live in the all-important suburbs that dominate much of the state's political scene, Holland added. In a hypothetical runoff, Nunn still holds a small margin over Perdue, 51% to 47%. But the poll's likely voter model can only estimate the November electorate, as a runoff election can draw a smaller and different crowd than the general election.","Democrat Michelle Nunn has a small 47%-44% edge over Republican David Perdue.

"A doctor who recently returned from Guinea has tested positive for Ebola -- the first case of the deadly virus in New York City and the fourth diagnosed in the United States. Here is a timeline of Craig Spencer's movements since he got back from the West African nation: . When did he return from Guinea? Spencer came back to the United States last week after treating Ebola patients in Guinea, where he worked for Doctors Without Borders. He completed his work in Guinea on October 12 and left the country two days later via Brussels, Belgium. He arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on October 17, but he exhibited no symptoms of the virus until Thursday morning, said Dr. Mary Travis Bassett, New York City's health commissioner. The physician, who works at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, was checking his temperature twice a day. He has not seen any patients since his return. Did he have any symptoms? The 33-year-old did not have any symptoms just after his return, but he developed a fever, nausea, pain and fatigue Thursday morning, authorities said. He began feeling sluggish a couple of days ago, but his fever spiked to 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 Celsius) the day his symptoms appeared. How many people has he been in contact with? Spencer was in contact with a few people after he started exhibiting symptoms. Ebola isn't contagious until someone has symptoms. Three people -- his fiancée and two friends --  are being placed on quarantine and monitored, health officials said. ""They are all well at this time; none of them is sick,"" Bassett said. What places did he visit? Spencer started feeling fatigued Tuesday, though without a fever, officials said. That day, he visited a coffee stand and a meatball restaurant in Manhattan. The next day, he ran for 3 miles in his neighborhood, and took the subway to a bowling alley in Brooklyn. He wasn't symptomatic until Thursday, when he had a low-grade fever, officials said. The bowling alley closed Thursday and its bar  was cleaned and sanitized as a precaution, it said.  Both the coffee stand and the bowling alley were assessed and cleared by health officials while the restaurant was expected to reopen Friday evening. Spencer also traveled on three subway lines. ""At the time that the doctor was on the subway, he did not have fever ... he was not symptomatic,"" Bassett said. Chances of anyone contracting the virus from contact with him are ""close to nil,"" she said. Is the hospital equipped to handle Ebola cases? Spencer is at New York's Bellevue Hospital Center, where he has been in isolation since emergency personnel took him there. It's one of eight hospitals statewide designated by Cuomo as part of an Ebola preparedness plan. ""We are as ready as one could be,"" Cuomo said. His state will be different from Texas, he said, where a Liberian man was diagnosed with Ebola and two nurses who treated him later contracted the virus. The man, Thomas Eric Duncan, died October 8. ""We had the advantage of learning from the Dallas experience,"" he said. CDC issues new hospital guidance for Ebola . How will his case be different from Duncan's? Duncan, who had flown from Liberia to Dallas, was the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. Two nurses who helped care for him also got infected, raising concerns about the nation's ability to deal with an outbreak. One of the Dallas nurses, Nina Pham, has been declared free of the Ebola virus while another one, Amber Vinson, is still hospitalized. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city followed every protocol in its handling of Spencer's case. For starters, Spencer was admitted to a hospital as soon as he developed symptoms, unlike Duncan, who was sent home with antibiotics the first time he went to Texas Presbyterian Hospital. Duncan returned days later and was hospitalized. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dispatched a team to New York to help with the case. ""We want to state at the outset there is no reason for New Yorkers to be alarmed,"" the mayor said. 5 things nurses say the Texas hospital got wrong . What about his neighbors? Spencer's Manhattan apartment has been isolated and locked. City health department workers canvassed the neighborhood, distributing information about Ebola and slipping fliers under doors, said Eugene Upshaw, who lives in Spencer's building. The handbills, which read ""Ebola: Am I at risk?"" explain the virus, its symptoms and how you can get it. ""What we're doing now is just telling the folks who live here in the neighborhood that they're safe. It's safe for them to be in their buildings, it's safe for them to go to their apartments, it's safe for them to walk down the street,"" said Sam Miller, associate commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The outbreak has killed nearly 5,000 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. How many Ebola cases have been diagnosed in the U.S.? Spencer is the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. After Duncan, who was infected in his native Liberia before being diagnosed in Dallas, two nurses treating him later tested positive. Latest Ebola developments . Have there been other cases involving Americans? Yes. Five other Americans have been diagnosed with Ebola in West Africa and later transferred to the U.S. for treatment.  They were treated and discharged from hospitals in Atlanta and Omaha, Nebraska. An additional American died of Ebola in July after traveling to Nigeria from Liberia.","Craig Spencer, 33, came back to the United States last week .

"Vice President Joe Biden said on Wednesday his use of the term ""Shylocks,"" which some consider anti-Semitic, was ""a poor choice of words."" His statement came a day after the national director of the Anti-Defamation League issued a mild rebuke of the vice president's use of the word, saying Biden ""should have been more careful."" At a Tuesday conference marking the 40th anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation, Biden recalled anecdotes from his son's experience serving in Iraq and meeting members of the military who were in need of legal help because of problems back at home. ""That's one of the things that he finds was most in need when he was over there in Iraq for a year,"" Biden said. ""That people would come to him and talk about what was happening to them at home in terms of foreclosures, in terms of bad loans that were being ... I mean these Shylocks who took advantage of, um, these women and men while overseas."" ADL National Director Abraham Foxman said Wednesday that the vice president called him. ""Clearly, there was no ill intent here, but Joe and I agreed that perhaps he needs to bone up on his Shakespeare.  There is no truer friend of the Jewish people than Joe Biden,"" Foxman said in a statement. ""Not only has he been a stalwart against anti-Semitism and bigotry, but he has the courage and forthrightness to admit a mistake and use it as an opportunity to learn and to teach others about the harmful effects of stereotypes. He has turned a rhetorical gaffe into a teachable moment."" The name ""Shylock"" derives from the name of the antagonist in Shakespeare's ""Merchant of Venice."" Shylock, a Jew, was a ruthless moneylender in the play, and he's remembered for demanding a ""pound of flesh"" from the merchant Antonio if he failed to repay a loan. On Tuesday, Foxman chided Bided, saying he ""should have been more careful,"" and added that the term ""represents the medieval stereotype about Jews and remains an offensive characterization to this day."" Biden said Foxman has been a longtime ""friend and adviser"" and was correct in his assessment of Biden's word choice. Biden, who's considering a presidential bid in 2016, traveled to Iowa on Wednesday to speak at a kickoff event for Nuns on the Bus, a  liberal Catholic social justice group based in Washington.","Biden says use of term considered offensive was a ""poor choice""

"(CNN)Two state senators in California are proposing legislation that would eliminate the ""personal beliefs"" exemption for parents who don't want their children to be vaccinated. Dr. Richard Pan and Ben Allen's announcement came on the day the state of California announced the number of measles cases had grown to 99. Many of those cases are tied to an outbreak at Disneyland in mid-December. The comparatively large number of cases in California this year and in the United States the past year have sparked debate over whether unvaccinated children should be allowed in public school. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Vaccines are a matter of fact . California allows exemptions from vaccinations for medical reasons and ""personal beliefs,"" and parents have been using them. ""As a pediatrician I have personally witnessed children suffering lifelong injury or death from vaccine-preventable infection,"" said Pan, who also wrote the California law that requires people who want to file a personal exemption to consult a doctor. He said the proposed bill would focus on vaccinations required to attend school. ""We're not reaching sufficient immunization rates and we want to reach the rates necessary to protect the public from those diseases,"" he told reporters in Sacramento. CNN affiliate KTLA reported several members of the California State Assembly will be co-authors of the bill. Measles outbreak: Different states, different rules on vaccinations . Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat. For most people, it doesn't get much worse than that -- and yet one out of every 20 children with measles also contract pneumonia, and one or two out of every 1,000 children with the disease die from it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While once widespread in the United States, cases dropped significantly because of vaccines. In 2000, health authorities declared that measles had been eliminated in the United States, which meant it was no longer native to the United States but continued to be brought in by international travelers. On Monday, a Southern California day care shut down because an infant there -- who is too young to be vaccinated -- contracted measles. The Samohi Infant Toddler Center inside Santa Monica High School, a facility for 24 children of students and staff members, closed Monday after it was learned that a baby under 12 months old being cared for there had measles. It's not clear when, where or how the child got the disease.

"(CNN)Jordan executed two al Qaeda prisoners before dawn Wednesday, following through on a promised strong response to the ISIS killing of pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh, a government spokesman said. Put to death were Sajida al-Rishawi, the Iraqi would-be suicide bomber whose release ISIS had previously requested, and Ziad Karbouli, a former top aide to the deceased leader of al Qaeda in Iraq,  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the spokesman said. Al-Rishawi was executed for her role in a 2005 suicide bombing at a wedding reception in Jordan that killed dozens. Karbouli was sentenced to death in 2007 after he was convicted of acts of terrorism that killed one person, the plotting of more terrorist attacks and the possession of explosives, the Jordanian spokesman said. The executions come a day after video and stills appeared to show a Jordanian military pilot being burned alive while confined in a cage. CNN is not showing images of the killing, which triggered global condemnation and prompted immediate promises of retaliation and protests in Jordan, one of more than 60 nations involved in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The 22-minute video begins with an attack on Jordan's King Abdullah II, suggesting he is to blame for what happened to the pilot, Moath al-Kasasbeh. A short time after the video became public, Jordanian military spokesman Mamdouh Al Amri said al-Kasasbeh was ""assassinated"" on January 3. His statement indicates the back-and-forth in recent weeks between Jordan and ISIS about a possible prisoner exchange to free the pilot took place after his death. Jordan repeatedly had asked ISIS to show proof that al-Kasasbeh was alive. ""Those who doubted the atrocities committed by ISIS now have the proof,"" Jordanian government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani said on state TV. ""Those who doubted Jordan's power will soon see the proof as well. (Al-Kasasbeh's) blood will not be shed in vain."" In Amman and in the pilot's hometown, crowds hit the streets, calling for revenge. ""With the blood and self,"" protesters chanted, ""we are sacrificing ourselves for Moath."" One demonstrator held a poster that read: ""They burned our hearts, so let's burn their dens, and their prisoners in our prisons."" Analysts have predicted the brutality of its latest video could come back to bite ISIS. ""I think there's likely to be a backlash, particularly in Jordan,"" said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst. ""I think it's sort of going to rally support for King Abdullah and his participation in the anti-ISIS coalition."" ISIS is known to be holding at least two Western hostages still: John Cantlie, a British journalist who has appeared in a number of ISIS-produced videos and an American woman who is a 26-year-old aid worker. ""The propaganda factor, I think, is going to completely backfire on them and the reason I say that is: When was the last time you had a mob in the street of one of these Muslim countries that was not screaming 'death to America,' but in fact screaming, 'get revenge on ISIS,' which essentially means, team up with America,"" said Tom Fuentes, a CNN law enforcement analyst. ""I think it's a huge mistake on the part of ISIS."" ISIS has recorded the deaths of its captives before, then disseminated the brutal footage online as propaganda. What makes the Jordanian pilot's case different is that he hailed from a Middle Eastern nation taking part in the anti-ISIS military coalition. The manner of execution also is different. In previous ISIS videos, captives were beheaded. A masked man with a London accent, dubbed ""Jihadi John,"" has appeared in at least six videos, standing near hostages. Sometimes, ISIS has threatened who it will kill next. At the end of its latest video, ISIS shows names and addresses of who it claims are Jordanian pilots. A reward is offered, and a voice says they are ""wanted dead."" ""I think they're sending a clear message to the Arab members of the coalition, and certainly Sunni Muslims who may be engaged in the fight against ISIS, that this is the way they're going to be treated. They're going to be treated brutally, and in fact, maybe perhaps more brutally than other members of the coalition,"" said Juan Zarate, a former U.S. deputy national security adviser. Militants said they captured al-Kasasbeh after he ejected from his crashing F-16 on December 24, having taken part in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes near Raqqa, Syria, the de facto ISIS capital. Almost immediately, he became a major pawn for ISIS. The Islamist extremist group had taken hostages before. But it hadn't captured anyone from the U.S.-led military coalition who was actively fighting to defeat it. His capture got the attention of many in Jordan, including King Abdullah, who is a former helicopter pilot. Jordanian officials had talked openly about the possibility of swapping al-Rishawi, a jihadist imprisoned in Jordan, for al-Kasasbeh. That demand was made via Japanese journalist Kenji Goto, who also was taken captive by ISIS. Goto, like other hostages before him, was killed, according to a video posted Saturday, before any exchange could occur. Gen. Lloyd Austin, commander of U.S. Central Command, said he's been in touch with the head of Jordan's armed forces about what he called ISIS' ""savage murder."" President Barack Obama said that the latest video, if authentic, is ""just one more indication of the viciousness and barbarity of this organization."" ""It, I think, will redouble the vigilance and determination on the part of a global coalition to make sure that they are degraded and ultimately defeated,"" Obama said. ""It also just indicates the degree to which whatever ideology they're operating off of, it's bankrupt."" He met Tuesday with Jordan's king, who cut short a trip to Washington following the pilot's killing. The President's comments were echoed in a statement from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. ""This horrific, savage killing is yet another example of ISIL's contempt for life itself,"" he said, using another common acronym for ISIS. ""The United States and its military stand steadfast alongside our Jordanian friends and partners; Jordan remains a pillar of our global coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and this act of despicable barbarity only strengthens our shared resolve."" According to the Jordan Times, an English-language newspaper published daily in the kingdom, al-Kasasbeh, 27, held the rank of lieutenant. One of eight children, he comes from Karak governorate and graduated from King Hussein Air College, the newspaper says. At the time of his capture, his father, Safi al-Kasasbeh, told the Jordan Times that his son was ""a very modest and religious person"" who memorized the Quran and ""was never harmful to anyone."" Safi al-Kasasbeh later demanded that Jordan do everything it could to free his son. ""I firmly ask whomever has sent Moath to fight outside the borders of Jordan, on a mission unrelated to us, to make strong efforts to bring back Moath,"" he said. ""Moath's blood is precious, it's precious and it represents the blood of all Jordanians."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described al-Kasasbeh as everything he says ISIS is not: ""He was brave, compassionate and principled."" ""That he was murdered after his father's plea for compassion reminds all the world that this foe has no agenda other than to kill and destroy, and places no value on life, including that of fellow Muslims,"" Kerry said.

"Officer Darren Wilson recently married another member of the Ferguson Police Department, a source close to Wilson said. According to a St. Louis County marriage license, Wilson on October 24 married Barbara Lynn Spradling, with whom he shares a home in St. Louis. Sparse information was available from the marriage license and application. Wilson, 28, is nine years younger than his wife and had a previous marriage end in divorce, dissolution or annulment, the application says. This was Spradling's first marriage. Municipal Judge Christopher Graville performed the service in Oakland, about 15 miles south of Ferguson, the marriage license says. Wilson's shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown is being investigated by a St. Louis County grand jury that will decide whether the officer will face charges. He is on paid administrative leave. What happens to Officer Wilson? A six-year veteran of the Ferguson Police Department, Wilson has not been seen in public since Brown's killing set off racial tensions in the  St. Louis suburb and beyond.","Darren Wilson married another Ferguson police officer, a source and documents say .

"(CNN) -- [Updated at 1:18 a.m. ET] . From New York to Los Angeles and dozens and dozens of cities in between, protesters flooded the streets to denounce a Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. A day after the country learned Wilson won't face criminal charges for killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown, protests sprouted up in more than 170 U.S. cities. Some demonstrations blocked bridges, tunnels and major highways. But unlike the violence that erupted in Ferguson on Monday night, the protests across the country Tuesday night were largely peaceful. New York . A massive protest wound its way from Union Square to FDR Drive and to the United Nations, Times Square and Harlem. ""Now it's not clear where we're going,"" said CNN's Miguel Marquez, who was interviewing protesters as they continued marching after midnight. One demonstrator said he didn't even know about the protest until he saw it pass by his workplace on Times Square. He decided to join in. ""I just want to help bring about change ... sometimes I am profiled based on my race,"" said the protester, who is black. ""I think this is progress ... now we're going to make sure things are going to change."" As they marched, some protesters chanted, ""Mike Brown! Mike Brown!"" Police, who were nearby in large numbers, stayed back and let the marchers go. Oakland, California . Perhaps the greatest concentration of turmoil Tuesday night was in Oakland, where vandals smashed the windows of a car dealership and looted several businesses, including a T-Mobile cell phone store. Some also set several bonfires in the city. One row of bonfires stretched across a road, blocking off access, footage from CNN affiliate KPIX showed. Some people were seen adding more items to the fires. Los Angeles . A stretch of the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles was shut down in both directions after protesters took road blocks from the streets, along with debris, and placed them on the freeway, police said. And demonstrators gathered outside of the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, Officer Sara Faden said. Faden said protesters are demonstrating peacefully. An LAPD spokesman said officers are allowing people to vent. ""We have detained people. We don't have any property damage to speak of,"" Officer Jack Richter said. ""We are letting (the people) exercise their constitutional rights."" Boston . Mayor Marty Walsh estimated about 1,000 protesters took to the streets Tuesday night. The gathering has been largely peaceful. ""It's a beautiful thing to see,"" demonstrator Daniel Jose Older said. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . Denver . Several hundred people took to the streets of Denver on Tuesday night, police said. Officers tried to prevent demonstrators from marching onto Interstate 25. Most protesters dispersed peacefully, but a ""small group"" refused and grabbed officers. Officers used pepper spray, and three people were arrested, police said. Dallas . About five protesters were arrested after marching on Interstate 35, CNN affiliate WFAA said. Some 200 demonstrators gathered at Dallas police headquarters before marching onto the interstate, the affiliate said. Washington . In Washington, protesters lay down on a sidewalk outside police headquarters as if dead, according to a tweet by Nikki Burdine of CNN affiliate WUSA. Some had handwritten notes on their chests: ""Black lives matter."" Minneapolis . A woman in a group blocking an intersection was run over by a car. The Star Tribune newspaper reported that the driver of the car honked at the protesters before knocking a few people onto the hood of the vehicle and apparently running over the woman's legs. She was hospitalized with ""very minor injuries."" Chicago . About 200 members of the Black Youth Project staged a sit-in outside Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office Tuesday afternoon. They planned to be there for 28 hours. Protesters in the New York area briefly blocked one of the entrances to the Lincoln Tunnel Tuesday evening, but then headed off to the city's West Side. Atlanta . The Public Enemy anthem pumping from mounted speakers at a protest in downtown Atlanta captured the mood of the crowd Tuesday night. ""Fight the Power,"" the rapper's voice shouted over the speaker. ""Fight the powers that be. ..."" About 300 people tried to follow Public Enemy's advice when they gathered to protest the grand jury's decision. As helicopters circled above, black college students, white urban hipsters in skinny jeans, middle-aged socialists and black militants in berets gathered for a raucous rally to vent their anger at the events in Ferguson. ""They have given us no justice! We will give them no peace,"" the demonstrators chanted at they massed in front of the Underground Atlanta shopping district. Some protesters had also gathered outside CNN Center. 'It's a travesty' Some Atlanta protesters held signs that read ""Enough"" and ""We are all one bullet away from being a hashtag."" One demonstrator wore a T-shirt that read, ""Racism isn't over but I'm over racism."" ""It's a travesty; it's just not right,"" ShaCzar Brown said as held up a sign that said, ""Stop killer cops."" ""Seventy years ago, it was legal to kill black people,"" Brown says, referring to the spate of lynchings that spread through the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ""It's essentially still legal."" Atlanta, birthplace of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., also saw emotional reaction Monday night when about 200 students gathered at Morehouse College to hear the grand jury's decision. A collective gasp rippled through the crowd when it came. Some of the students at the historically black men's school looked at one another in disbelief, others started to tear up, and a few stared ahead as their jaws dropped. Police sirens wailed in the distance as the students chanted: ""Ferguson's hell is America's hell."" Largely peaceful protests . ""I think what happened yesterday is a great injustice to everyone that's been fighting for equality in this country,"" one Chicago protester told WGN on Tuesday. ""And I think that just because a bad decision was made doesn't mean people who believe in equality are going to fall silent."" Protests have been organized in more than 30 states, the District of Columbia and at least three other countries, according to information compiled by CNN and a site set up to help organize protest efforts.

"Everett, Washington (CNN) -- Sprawled out before us sits the exterior of the world's biggest building by volume. They make airliners here. Big ones. ""Let's go see some airplanes!"" says our Boeing VIP tour guide. I remind myself: This doesn't happen very often. Yeah yeah yeah, Boeing offers public tours of this 98.3-acre airliner factory north of Seattle every day. This ain't that. This is special. As part of a convention of aviation fans called Aviation Geek Fest, we're gaining ultra-exclusive access to the factory FLOOR. The public tour is limited to the balcony. We're about to walk knee-deep where Boeing gives birth to some of the world's biggest and most advanced airliners, including the 747-8 Intercontinental, the 777 Worldliner and the 787 Dreamliner. Hot damn. But not so fast -- before we go inside, Boeing has laid down some rules: no photos, no video, for our eyes only. Here's a painful development: Our smartphones have been confiscated. Gulp. I'm already suffering from phantom phone pangs. We enter through a small, inconspicuous door marked S-1. Suddenly, we're surrounded by partly assembled airliners in a room so big it takes on the feeling of an entire world. In some spots, we gaze across an unobstructed view measuring a quarter-mile. This building is so flippin' big that -- years ago -- it created its own inside weather patterns, including vapor clouds. They eliminated that by installing a special ventilation system. Today's factory forecast: avgeeking, with continued avgeeking and a favorable chance of avgeeking later in the day. Here are a few cool tidbits: . Jaw-dropping perspective . The thrill of being so close to the planes literally stops you in your tracks. Seemingly everywhere you look there's another five- or six-story-tall airplane towering over you. Some are covered with a green, protective temporary coating. One Dreamliner tail is painted with the familiar British Airways red, white and blue. Another sports New Zealand Air's cool black-and-white. Boeing paints the tails before they're attached to the planes. Then they carefully adjust the tails for balance. Paint adds hundreds of pounds of weight, which would ruin the plane's balance if the tails were painted after being attached. Soon these behemoths will jet across vast oceans as they carry travelers to far-flung destinations. 'You've gotta have secret clearance' The planes' huge fuselages are joined together with the help of a giant piece of equipment called a ""saddle."" This U-shaped metal cage straddles the top of the planes during the body-joining process. The ""Wing Build"" area -- where workers attach wings to the planes -- is the loudest part of the entire facility. The staccato of rivet guns pierces the heavy air. Whooshing vacuums suck up any dust that may be created when workers drill into the planes' lightweight carbon composite material. Security concerns in the plant are real. ""Conversation-restricted area,"" says one sign. As we walk past a fenced-off zone, our guide quips, ""You've gotta have secret clearance. I can't even go in there!"" The rock star engine . Then, like a holy relic brought back from the Crusades -- Boeing lets us touch ""it."" By ""it"" we mean the GE90-115B. Guinness calls it the most powerful commercially produced jet engine in the world. We gather around this rock star engine like thirsty travelers at a desert oasis, each taking turns running our hands across its silver exterior. The lip of the engine's mouth feels rough, like it has countless scratches etched into it. That design, engineers discovered, helps reduce noise. This 19,000-pound monster hangs from the wing of a giant 777, but the engine still looks humongous -- measuring more than 11 feet in diameter. In fact, Boeing says it's so big you could fit the body of a 737 airliner inside it. ""There's no way to sense the sheer size of an airplane without being right there underneath it,"" says NYCAviation.com contributor Ben Granucci, enjoying his first Aviation Geek Fest. Engines like this make it possible for wide-body planes to fly long-distance routes nonstop with only two engines instead of three or four. In fact, the 777 flies many of the world's longest nonstop routes. In 2005 it set the world distance record for a nonstop commercial airline flight, jetting 13,423 miles from Hong Kong eastbound to London in 22 hours, 22 minutes. The world's top flying hauler . Just a few hours earlier, a handful of aviation geeks were hanging out at a hotel next to Paine Field, the airport Boeing uses to test and deliver the factory's planes. Then, Granucci tweeted out that the plane that hauls the most cargo by volume in the world just happened to be passing through. Count me in. Soon, a dozen camera-wielding geeks are lined up outside the hotel to welcome the Dreamlifter -- a modified 747 -- as it lumbers in for a landing. ""We're gonna be late for breakfast,"" says avgeek Steve Dillo as he snaps photo after photo. ""But this is worth it."" The thing roars like a lion, but it looks like a whale as it slows for touchdown. In the entire world, there are only four of these giant planes. Boeing uses them to ferry big sections of the 787 for final assembly here in Everett. Last year, when a Dreamlifter landed at the wrong airport in Kansas, it wasn't exactly a stellar moment. The Avgeek News Network . This is the fifth avgeek fest, co-sponsored by AirlineReporter.com and Everett's Future of Flight Museum. The February convention drew a record 300-plus participants from 18 different states and three countries. Former GM and Toyota engineer Philip McKenzie, flew 8,000 miles from Melbourne, Australia, to see how ""things are laid out"" in the factory. Vancouver Airport official Trevor Batstone traveled 100 miles from Canada. Who are these people -- these avgeeks? What defines them? ""It's someone who always looks up in the sky when they hear a jet roar,"" says Ryan Ewing, 14, who runs airlinegeeks.com out of his Bethesda, Maryland, home. Ewing was right there in the thick of the geeks with his camera when the Dreamlifter came calling. The event was born from an aviation-obsessed online community that uses social media to organize and share information. Aviation news sites like Airchive, AirlineReporter, NYCAviation and AirlineGuys all share common friends, connections and interests. When news breaks, their informal social network sometimes challenges traditional news media. This month AirlineReporter and a few other aviation sites broke news about the hijacking of an Ethiopian Airlines 767 in Rome about 30 minutes before many ""legacy"" news organizations, says AirlineReporter founder and editor-in-chief David Parker Brown. Boeing's desire to connect with fans and fliers combined with the emerging power of the avgeek nation opened the doors to the exclusive Boeing tours, Brown says. ""Boeing has increasingly realized how smart and educated about aviation avgeeks are."" Baby Boeings . The following day southeast of Seattle, Boeing opens up yet another factory for us to tour. This one is the birthplace of what Guinness calls the ""most produced large commercial jet in aviation history"" -- the 737. No public tours here. This is a tour for avgeeks and VIPs. ""Avgeeks love getting access to places that are off limits,"" says Brown. ""It's all about exclusivity."" Here's some 737 tour trivia: . —This place creates 38 of the planes every month on a moving assembly line. And they're pushing to increase that rate. ""Even though we joke that the 737 is the 'Baby Boeing,' it's still a large and complex machine,"" says Granucci. ""It requires precision to put it together. The fact that you can perform such precise work on a moving target -- I find that to be incredible."" — The facility receives pre-assembled fuselages by train from a factory in Wichita, Kansas. — Workers attach wings to the fuselages. It takes about nine hours to put wings on a 737. —The planes also get ""winglets"" — the tiny, upward pointing wings you see on the wingtips of 737s and other airliners. These doodads reduce drag on the plane and make it more fuel efficient — by about 4%. —Workers install seats on the planes by using a loading machine they call a ""hay baler."" — In an operation called ""high blow,"" Boeing tests each plane's passenger cabin for possible leaks during pressurization. The procedure includes putting people inside the planes to listen for leaks. — Each 737 is made up of 42 miles of wire and 394,000 separate parts . — If there's a problem on the assembly line, workers activate a purple flashing light -- alerting others that they need help. ""Blinking purple is bad for us here,"" says Christian Ofsthus, a Boeing senior manager. ""If there's something wrong, something doesn't fit, we need to do something about that."" As the tour ends, we wind through an employee diner named for the World War II symbol Rosie the Riveter, and file back onto our bus. Driving off the property, we spot a train loaded with brand new wingless 737 fuselages headed to the factory behind us. That triggers spontaneous applause and scattered whoops throughout the bus. Well, you just can't get any geekier than that. ""That is so cool,"" I hear someone say. ""Yeah,"" said someone else, ""baby planes!""","Boeing allowed aviation fans unique factory access during a February convention .

"Washington  (CNN)Former President Bill Clinton reflected on the months of protests that have swept across America in response to the deaths unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement, saying in an interview airing Friday that the country needs to make ""people feel that everybody matters again."" ""The fundamental problem you have anywhere is when people think their lives and the lives of their children don't matter, they they are somehow disposable, just like a paper napkin after a lunch at a restaurant or something,"" Clinton told CNN En Español. ""If we want our freedom to be in deed as well as word in America, we have to make people feel that everybody matters again."" Clinton, who was in Miami for the Clinton Foundation ""Future of the Americas"" summit, argued that the two issues at play in the protests were whether law enforcement made the correct decisions and how police departments can improve their relationships with communities. In the last three weeks, grand juries have cleared police officers in the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Clinton argued that in both cases, policing was an issue. ""There is not any question in Ferguson, whatever the findings of the grand jury, if the law enforcement officer had not gone after the man and felt compelled to shoot him, he would be alive,"" Clinton said. And on Garner in Staten Island, Clinton was clear to point out that ""police policy was against putting someone in a choke hold."" During the interview with Juan Carlos Lopez at the University of Miami, Clinton spoke at length about foreign policy throughout the Americas and the recent release of the CIA torture report. ""I think this is just the beginning,"" the former president said. ""There will now be a real effort to find out what the details were and whether or not any other action is appropriate in that."" Clinton has been getting used to playing second (or possibly third) fiddle in his family. Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016 and the recent birth of Chelsea Clinton's first child, Charlotte, has been the fascination of many. As is the case with every interview, Bill Clinton was asked about his wife's presidential aspirations and when, in particular, Hillary Clinton expects to announce her candidacy. ""I don't even know if she is going to run,"" Bill Clinton said. ""But if she, sometime next year I think she will make a decision and announce it."" The full interview with Bill Clinton will air on CNN Español at 6 p.m. ET Friday and on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET.","Clinton spoke in reference to protests of black men being killed at the hands of law enforcement .

"Saying she'd just heard her husband ""pleading for his life,"" the wife of Alan Henning delivered her own plea to ISIS on Tuesday, as well as a slap at the extremist group for threatening to kill the British aid worker who'd only gone to Syria to ""help his Muslim friends."" In a message released by the British foreign office, Barbara Henning said that she had received an audio file with her husband's voice, but hasn't been able to contact those holding him. ""Islamic State continue to ignore our pleas to open dialogue,"" she said. So -- without the chance to talk to his captors confidentially -- Barbara Henning instead made made another public pitch for her husband's life. Barbara Henning noted the widespread sentiment voiced by Muslim leaders around the world calling for Alan's release. They include Shaykh Haitham Al Haddad, a judge on the Shariah Council in London, who has said that ""whatever your grievance with American or British foreign policy, executing this man is not the answer."" ""I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan's fate,"" Barbara Henning said. ""The voices of the people have spoken out loud and clear."" How many more Western captives is ISIS holding? Similar to what she'd said in a message Saturday, Barbara Henning said that Alan had gone to the region -- not to join one side or the other, or to spy for a certain group -- but to do what he could to improve the lives of people in the region. A taxi driver from near Manchester, England, Alan Henning was part of a team of volunteers that traveled to Syria in December to deliver food and water to people affected by the Middle Eastern country's devastating civil war. He was abducted the day after Christmas by masked gunmen, according to other people in the aid convoy. ""He was working with Muslims to help the most vulnerable within Syria. Nothing has changed,"" Barbara Henning said. ""He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much needed aid."" Henning's friends plead with ISIS to let him go . Barbara Henning said she'd been told that a Sharia -- or Islamic law -- court had found Alan Henning ""innocent of being a spy and declared (him) to be no threat."" Why, then, would ISIS not ""abide by the decisions of their own justice system?"" she asked. ""We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life,"" she said. ""Please release Alan."" Yet ISIS hasn't shown any mercy yet to its captives, at least the ones it has trotted out before cameras. This summer, the group beheaded American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- gruesomely showing their killings in videos posted online. ISIS then claimed its first British victim, aid worker David Haines, according to video that appeared online on September 13. Henning appeared kneeling in that last video, with an ISIS militant standing menacingly by his side. The families of Foley, Sotloff and Haines all issued public pleas for their loved ones' lives, but to no avail. Barbara Henning on Tuesday voiced her frustration that her husband's captors won't even allow her to make a case to them directly. She noted that she and her representatives have tried reaching ""out to those holding Alan,"" but they haven't gotten a response.

"(CNN)They made America feel good, those kids from Chicago's South Side who beat the odds and beat all contenders en route to the U.S. Little League championship. But now those feelings, like the championship, are no more. Little League International announced Wednesday that it is vacating all of the Jackie Robinson West squad's wins from last year's tournament, including from the Great Lakes regionals and U.S. championship, because some of its players lived outside its assigned boundaries. Mountain Ridge Little League, out of Las Vegas, officially becomes the 2014 U.S. champ in its place. The international youth baseball organization also suspended Jackie Robinson West's manager, ousted the local district administrator and barred the program from tournament play. Reflecting on what he called ""a heartbreaking decision,"" Little League International President Stephen Keener said the Chicago team's players can still be proud of what they accomplished last year. ""But it is unfortunate that the actions of adults have led to this outcome,"" Keener added. ""... As painful as this is, we feel it a necessary decision to maintain the integrity of the Little League program. No team can be allowed to attempt to strengthen its team by putting players on their roster that live outside their boundaries."" Brandon Green, a player on the Jackie Robinson West team, said the players weren't involved in anything that should cause the squad to be stripped of its title. ""We know that we're champions, our parents know that we're champions ... and Chicago knows we're champions,"" he said at a news conference. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Keener and the two spoke for 10 minutes, a spokeswoman for the mayor, Kelley Quinn, said. Emanuel told the Little League official that the players didn't deserve to be punished. The organization should have sanctioned the adults, he said. ""You have turned them into the perpetrators when they are the victims,"" Emanuel told him, according to his spokeswoman.  ""You know what they have done for Chicago, and let's face it, you know what they've done for your tournament."" Named for the icon who broke baseball's color barrier and consisting entirely of African-Americans, the Jackie Robinson West squad proved that, despite talk to the contrary, baseball was not dead among inner-city youth. The Illinois team earned raves after knocking out Sports Illustrated cover girl Mo'ne Davis' Philadelphia team and rolling to the U.S. championship contest. It entered that game as an underdog to Las Vegas, which had beaten every team it faced -- including crushing Chicago by a 13-2 score. The title game was a much more even affair. The two squads swapped leads before Chicago jumped ahead for good with a three-run fifth inning en route to a 7-5 win. In the World Series final the following day, Jackie Robinson West rallied late but couldn't overcome the eventual champions from South Korea. That loss didn't halt the positive feelings about the team. Everyone from former Chicago White Sox great and baseball Hall of Famer Frank Thomas and longtime Obama adviser David Axelrod cheered their success. Mayor Rahm Emanuel credited ""their positive attitude and success on the field (for rallying) people from every neighborhood."" The team was celebrated with a parade through their hometown and even a visit to the White House in November, where they met President Barack Obama, a Chicago resident. At the time of the Washington visit, local Little League officials were already investigating thanks to a tip from a neighboring district's official and documentation. Little League International initially determined that all of Jackie Robinson West's players were eligible. In the middle of December, though, ""Little League began to learn of multiple issues with boundary maps and operational process with multiple leagues in Illinois District 4,"" the international organization said in a statement. Several more meetings followed, including one on January 31 when several issues came up, including that ""Jackie Robinson West Little League used a falsified boundary map for their 2014 tournament and that Jackie Robinson West Little League officials met with other leagues in District 4 to try to get the territory they wrongfully claimed was theirs for their 2014 tournament."" ""During our review, it became clear that both Jackie Robinson West officials and (the) District Administrator ... signed documents to make players eligible who should not have been,"" Keener said. CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","Player says he and teammates did nothing wrong and are still champions .

"(CNN) -- In the 1990s, a professor at a medical university in Stockholm decided to test his students' knowledge about the progress of global development. He was staggered to discover the class, some of the brightest people in Sweden, scored fewer than two out of five on average. Chimpanzees randomly choosing answers would likely have done better, scoring half right. That academic was Hans Rosling, Professor of Global Health at the Karolinska Institutet and a medical doctor who had carried out decades of research in Africa, discovering the complexities of the continent (and a new disease) along the way. His work in Africa had resulted in ""an enormous intellectual irritation that we lumped countries as different as Brazil and Mozambique together under the label 'the developing world'."" Rosling has been on a mission to inform since the realization that his students -- and his fellow professors -- were somewhat woefully informed about the state of the world. Today CNN publishes Rosling's latest survey of the United States which shows Americans, like most of the world, are far behind the reality in their understanding of world development but ahead of some -- for example, Swedes. He wants to challenge the preconceptions we all have about the state of progress in the world, hoping that if we recognize our ignorance we can see what has been achieved and tackle the outstanding problems. In 2005, he co-founded the Gapminder Foundation, which aims to ""promote a fact-based world view."" The following year, Rosling spoke at a conference run by TED -- the non profit organization ""devoted to ideas worth spreading."" ""The problem for me was not ignorance,"" he told the audience, ""it was preconceived ideas."" Rosling's striking data presentation, showcasing software developed by Gapminder, has since been viewed more than six million times through TED, which describes him as a ""data visionary."" You can watch the video here or to the left of this text. In May 2012, TIME magazine named Rosling one of the ""World's 100 Most Influential People."" Describing Rosling for the TIME list, Harvard social scientist Nicholas A. Christakis said he was ""in the vanguard of a critically important activity: advancing the public understanding of science."" Now Rosling, and Gapminder, are testing that public understanding, this year conducting web-based ""Ignorance surveys"" -- in Sweden and Britain, and, most recently, the United States. Want to test your knowledge? Then click on the image at the top of this article to complete the same survey and compare how you did to the U.S. respondents. Click here for the U.S. results on Gapminder.org . How did you go? Was your global perception spot on? Or did you display a lack of understanding of the progress in education, health and fertility reduction and income inequality in the world? More importantly, what was it that led to your choices? If your answers were correct, were they based on factual knowledge? Or did you follow the example of chimpanzees and guess randomly? Is it possible that you were informed by the ""toxic combination of arrogance and ignorance"" Rosling believes is often displayed by western Europeans and North Americans -- the ""Old West."" As a university lecturer, he saw that his students had ""a very old view of the world."" ""There was constant discussion of the world in terms of 'we and they',"" he said. Rosling realized the concept of ""developed"" and ""developing"" countries was hindering understanding of the emerging world, giving an impression of remaining homogeneity of a so-called ""developing world"". The terms did not describe ""the enormous difference between Brazil and Somalia, Malaysia and Afghanistan."" Rosling's corporate audiences also failed to understand the characteristics of each country: ""They had a sort of regional concept of the world that said 'South East Asia is like this, Latin America is like that, the Middle East is like that',"" he said. ""We have the United Arab Emirates and Yemen bordering ... Barbados and Haiti -- Barbados can compete with the United States on child mortality. ""There's no homogeneity between Finland and Greece but between Greece and Chile, there's no major difference,"" he said. ""I think that it's the failure to grasp that the new emerging world has countries on each and every level that makes people fail so badly on the world test."" Read more: Why 'developing vs. developed' world is now meaningless . The world was easier to explain 50 years ago, Rosling says. ""Once a third of the population was living separated from the rest at the rich end -- they called themselves Western."" While too many people were still living with the misery of poverty, he said the new reality was that there was a continuous variation of socioeconomic levels. ""As late as the late 1970s it was still a camel with two humps ... today the camel is dead -- it has been replaced by a dromedary with one hump,"" he said. ""I used to say you can't divide the population of London into clever and stupid,"" Rosling said. ""The vast majority is in the middle -- that's how the world is today."" ""When we ask about literacy rates in the world, when we ask about life expectancy, the percentage of children vaccinated ... people think about Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia -- the worst-off cases -- and then they extrapolate to the rest of what they still think is a developing world. ""They understand there is a huge disparity between the richest and the poorest but then they think there is a big hump in the poor and sick end -- that's not the case anymore,"" he said. Social progress . And Rosling says it's a mistake to assume a country's economic position matches its social development. ""Today the social dimension of life progresses much, much, faster than the economic,"" he said. ""Vietnam today has the same life expectancy, the same disease burden, as the U.S. had in 1980 -- they're only 30 years behind. But economically they correspond to the U.S. in 1880 -- they are still 130 years behind economically,"" he said. ""It means today, countries get healthy before they get rich. People's skill are ahead of their economy."" Rosling said that for him the most surprising lack of knowledge demonstrated in the quiz was on the measles vaccination. Just 17% of the U.S. respondents chose the correct answer -- 80% of the world's children are vaccinated by their first birthday. Forty-four per cent wrongly guessed a fifth of children and 39% said half. ""That to me was absolutely astonishing because it is the most solid and stable success of the world. Now we vaccinate 4 out of 5 children,"" said Rosling. ""It's a beautiful example of global collaboration, life saving technology, the flagship of aid, awareness among governments and parents in even the poorest countries -- and it's not known."" China and India . Rosling says his experience suggests that the CEO's of the world's biggest companies have the most fact-based knowledge, seeking for example to move research and development to India and China and competing for the skilled workforce, wherever they were born and trained. The two countries, 25 years ago known for cheap goods produced by low paid workers, were now competing at engineering level, he said ""and that professional skill is also happening faster than the economic growth."" ""[Their engineers] are much, much more competent than their income suggests."" Rosling pointed to last week's results from the OECD's measure of school achievement, the ""PISA"" tests. Sweden, he said had fallen in maths more than any other country. ""The shining star in the world is Shanghai,"" he said. ""That's what CEOs from big companies say -- 'if I want mathematical analytical work done, it's done in China'."" Rosling warned however that it would be a mistake to assume that poverty was no longer an issue, and that while income inequality between countries had decreased, inside most nations it had widened. ""There is still a severe and scary amount of extreme poverty in rural parts of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Burma and sub-Saharan Africa,"" he said. Predicting the wants of middle income countries is comparatively easy he says -- they are things such as education, hot and cold water, refrigeration and transport, in short modern homes and lives. ""But how fast extreme poverty will leave Afghanistan, northern Nigeria -- that's difficult to predict, but it will. If it doesn't, the world as a whole will have a major problem -- it won't function with collapsed areas. To me it seems easier to end it fast instead of slowly, as the population keeps growing so fast in the poorest communities."" Rosling describes his role at Gapminder as ""Edutainer,"" and says he aims to convey deadly serious facts with humour -- and compete with tabloids maintaining content worthy of the Swedish Academy of Science, of which he is a member. The Ignorance survey is one way of encouraging people to adopt a fact-based view of the world. ""We see that this as the theoretical part of a driving license,"" he said. ""It tells you how to drive, not where to drive. ""It is the structure in which you can put more detailed knowledge of the world. It's a shelf."" The U.S. survey was the third of its kind undertaken by the Gapminder Foundation, a non-profit organization with the stated aim of ""fighting devastating ignorance with fact-based world views everyone can understand. Gapminder put 10 questions to 1015 online respondents in November 2013. Those surveyed were based across the U.S., aged 18 and above and had educations ranging from less than high school qualification to doctorates. Gapminder have done the surveys in close collaboration with Swedish survey company, Novus Group International AB.","Hans Rosling is a medical doctor and lecturer who spent decades working in Africa .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- In a series of blunt tweets over the holiday weekend, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei entered America's debate on race and police violence -- comparing unrest in states like New York and Missouri to conflicts in the Middle East. On Sunday he tweeted: ""#Jesus endured sufferings to oppose tyrants who had put humans in hell in this world& the hereafter while he backed the oppressed. #Ferguson"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's chief political and religious authority, acknowledged the role of Jesus in Islamic theology and compared the biblical prophet's struggle to that of black people in the United States. The tweet included #BlackLivesMatter, a hashtag popularized in recent weeks by supporters of Eric Garner, a 43-year old African-American man that died after being put in a chokehold by a NYPD officer. It read: ""It's expected that followers of #Jesus follow him in his fight against arrogants and in his support for the oppressed. #BlackLivesMatter"" On Christmas Eve, the Ayatollah lumped the struggle of Palestinians in the Gaza strip with protests in Ferguson, Missouri, where black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by police, and called on members of all three monotheistic faiths to stand-up against oppression. The tweet said: ""#Jesus like all prophets was herald of monotheism& human dignity; nowadays humanity needs this message more than ever.#Ferguson #Gaza 1/1/93"" The unverified Twitter account, widely accepted as the mouthpiece of the Ayatollah's social media campaign, often posts diatribes against the West and Israel to its more than 91,000 followers. In August of this year, the leader published a poignant image that criticized President Barack Obama's support for Israel during the country's military operation to debilitate Hamas, a group many Western nations including the U.S. designate as a terrorist organization. ""US govt has subjugated a great nation w/ massive resources to a criminal regime like #Israel.10/31/12 #Ferguson #Gaza,"" it said. In response, some Twitter users accused the Ayatollah of hypocrisy, and tweeted him with hashtags such as #AllLivesMatter, #GayLivesMatter and #KurdishLivesMatter. Human rights groups and observers regularly criticize the country for its poor record on executions, the treatment of political prisoners, and women. In its 2013 report on Iran, Human Rights Watch said: ""Many civil society activists remained in prison on political charges. Authorities regularly subjected prisoners, especially those convicted on politically motivated charges, to abuse and deprive them of necessary medical treatment. ""Iranian women continued to face discrimination in many areas including personal status matters. Authorities restricted political participation and employment of minority groups, who account for about 10% of the population."" 2013: Iran reaches out on Twitter at Christmas .","Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei compares U.S. protests to Middle East conflicts .

"Was he a suspect or a victim? A Florida sheriff says an unarmed man -- mistaken for a car thief and shot by deputies in his own driveway -- is both. He refused to obey commands and lunged at the deputies who fired their weapons 15 times to subdue him, they say. Roy Middleton, 60, was hit by two of those rounds in his legs. He is in good condition at a Pensacola hospital after a metal rod was placed inside his shattered left leg. ""The tragedy of this is the noncompliance to the directions of law enforcement officers,"" said Sheriff David Morgan of Escambia County, Florida. ""Had that occurred we wouldn't be having this discussion.  It's a tragedy all the way around.  He is both a suspect and a victim."" 'Like a firing squad' The bizarre story started Saturday around 2:30 a.m. as Middleton was returning home. Searching for a cigarette inside his White Lincoln Town Car, he appears to have been mistaken for a car thief by a concerned neighbor who called 911. Escambia County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremiah Meeks and Sgt. Matthew White responded to the call. This is where the story takes a fork in the road. Middleton's family said he was not feeling well enough to discuss what happened to him. But earlier this week, he told the Pensacola News Journal that he first thought someone was joking when they yelled at him to, ""Get your hands where I can see them."" He said that as he was turning around to face deputies with his hands raised, they opened fire. ""It was like a firing squad. Bullets were flying everywhere,"" he told the News Journal. Deputies feared for their lives . But the deputies involved told a different story. Meeks fired 12 shots and White fired three times, authorities said.  They are now on paid administrative leave.  Five of the bullets hit the White Town car, which was parked under a carport in a dark area of the property. The deputies were in fear for their own safety, according to the sheriff. ""He came out of the car with more of a lunging motion coming out of the car, and the deputies were standing behind him and he had what appeared to be a metallic object in his hand,"" Sheriff David Morgan said. Not buying it . But Middleton's family doesn't believe that story.  His mother, Ceola Walker, 77,  told CNN that her son was holding his car keys with a small flashlight on the key chain.  She does not believe he lunged at deputies. ""I don't believe that. He said he didn't.  I don't believe that,"" she said. She says her son is incredibly lucky. ""They could have hit his upper body, but they didn't ....God just shielded him.  I know he did, cause they was trying to kill him,"" she said. Andre Lauzon, who lives next door and witnessed the incident, said it lasted less than 30 seconds. Deafening gunfire . He was out smoking a cigarette on his front lawn when the deputies arrived, he said.  His view was obscured by darkness, and at one point he lost sight of Middleton. But the sound of gunfire, he said, was deafening. ""I'm very surprised that all they did was hit him in the leg,"" he said. Timeline, lab analysis . Lauzon says his neighbor may have had trouble getting down to the ground because he was standing between his car and the wall of the carport. ""I don't have any doubt -- even not being able to see what was going on -- that he was complying with them,"" he told CNN. "" Maybe not in the time frame that the officer was looking for -- but it seemed he was complying."" The Florida Department of Law Enforcement has taken over the investigation at the request of the Sheriff's Office. ""FDLE investigators are developing a timeline and conducting interviews and crime laboratory scientists are conducting lab analysis,""  Gretl Plessinger, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement.  ""Once our investigation is complete, FDLE will provide the case to the state attorney's office. The state attorney will determine whether or not any laws were broken. Walker said her son takes pain medication for a bad back. The investigation will determine whether that played a role in the incident. ""The message to the public is this was a tragedy,"" Morgan said. ""And it was a tragedy because we had an individual, a citizen, who for whatever reason, either impairment due to alcohol or drugs, or just taking it upon himself not to be compliant to following basic direct orders."" But his mother disputes the sheriff's theory that her son was a suspect and a victim at the same time. ""How can you be a suspect and a victim at your own house?  In your own yard, in your own car?"" Walker asked. Appeals court: No immunity from lawsuit for ex-transit officer who killed Oscar Grant .","They fire at him, and two rounds hit his legs .

"(CNN) -- Hungary are through to the under-20 World Cup semifinals after a dramatic 3-2 victory over Italy in Suez in a match which saw four players sent off, three for the Italians, the official FIFA Web site has reported. Krisztian Nemeth (right) scored two goals in extra time to see Hungary through in a dramatic quaterfinal. The game began in dramatic circumstances when Italy defender Matteo Gentili shoved Liverpool striker Krisztian Nemeth in the penalty area in the opening minute. Hungary captainr Vladimir Koman sent Vincenzo Fiorillo the wrong way from the spot to give Hungary an early lead -- the quickest goal of the tournament so far. Both sides missed a host of chances to add to the scoreline, until Italy's chances took a turn for the worse when Gentili hauled down Nemeth again with 19 minutes remaining to collect a second yellow card. Despite the man disadvantage, Italy rallied and levelled in the 82nd minute when substitute Giacomo Bonaventura threaded a delightful throughball to Antonio Mazzotta in the box and the left-back finished superbly. Italy were reduced to nine men two minutes later when Francesco Bini was given a straight red card for kicking out at Koman. However, the two-men numerical disadvantage did not last long as Adrian Szekeres was also dismissed for what appeared to be an elbow on Mattia Mustachio. The match went into extra time and in the 112th minute, Koman found Nemeth with a delightful pass and the striker made no mistake. Remarkably though, just a minute later Italy equalized again when Giacomo Bonaventura ran at the Hungary defence and unleashed a shot which flew home. That was not the end of the drama. A second yellow to Michelangelo Albertazzi reduced the Italians to eight men and left their defense completely stretched. And Hungary took advantage when Nemeth chased down a long ball before showing great composure to steer the ball home. Hungary will now play Ghana in the last four after the African nation twice held off a spirited South Korean fightback to secure a 3-2 victory earlier in the day. Ghana took an eighth minute lead when Dominic Adiyiah stabbed a Samuel Inkoom's ball past goalkeeper Kim Seung-Guy. It was the second quickest goal of Egypt 2009 and the striker's fifth of the tournament. Ransford Osei doubled their lead 20 minutes later when David Addy found him lurking in the six-yard box and the FC Twente player fired home a left-foot strike. However, Korea pulled a goal back three minutes later when Jeong Dong-Ho put in a cross from the right in-between the back four and goalkeeper and Park Hee-Seong took advantage by looping a header into the net. The match looked over in the 78th minute when Mohammed Rabiu picked up a loose ball in midfield and slipped it to Adiyiah, who powered through and passed it into the net. But still Korea refused to give in and they made it a nervy last eight minutes for Ghana when Yun Suk-Young crossed from deep and Kim Dong-Sub timed his run to perfection to glance a header into the net.","Hungary defeat Italy 3-2 in a dramatic match to reach World Cup U-20 semis .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen on Sunday launched a predawn attack on the Nigerian city of Maiduguri and were locked in a fierce battle with government troops on the outskirts of the city, according to the military, residents and citizen vigilantes. The militants launched a simultaneous attack on the town of Monguno and were apparently successful in taking control of the town and its military barracks, a Nigerian military officer in Maiduguri told CNN. ""Our soldiers initially repelled the terrorists but they mobilized more fighters and came back in full force. They overwhelmed our troops and forced them to retreat,"" said the officer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Monguno, a town of about 100,000 people in northeast Nigeria, is about a 135-kilometer (85-mile) drive from Maiduguri, a city of more than 600,000. Both cities are tucked into the corner of the country, near the borders with Chad and Cameroon. Babagana Musa, a Monguno resident who fled to Maiduguri, said, ""Several trucks carrying soldiers drove into Maiduguri. We learned the town (Monguno) has been taken over by Boko Haram."" Monguno, with its huge military barracks, has a strategic importance ‎in that it acts as a buffer to keep Boko Haram from advancing towards Maiduguri. Its fall means Boko Haram is in good position to advance on Maiduguri, which has been its goal for months. Boko Haram had been confined to the fishing town of Baga since its fighters seized it January 3, hesitant to move south towards Maiduguri because of the military presence in Monguno. The Islamists attacked the nearby village of Jintilo around 5 a.m. and were engaged in a gunbattle with troops stationed there. The village is about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the center of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Speaking to reporters Sunday afternoon, Borno Governor Kashim Shettima said, ""So long as we have the resources, we will continue to regard the efforts to reclaim peace our No. 1 area of commitments. I want to reassure the good people of Borno State that we will never abdicate from our responsibility as those they entrusted with leadership."" He further said he had canceled all engagements outside of Borno and intends to ""remain behind with our people through thick and thin,"" and after meeting with other past and present leaders in Northern Nigeria, ""pressures are being combined and channeled to the right authorities to ensure that the insurgency problems are brought to an end as quickly as possible."" Shettima closed by asking the people of Borno to remain ""optimistic and vigilant"" and urged residents to keep close watch over their children and report any ""strange person and movement"" to authorities. The Islamists attacked the nearby village of Jintilo around 5 a.m. and were engaged in a gunbattle with troops stationed there. The village is about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the center of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. The fighting in Jintilo forced residents to evacuate their homes and flee into the city, while military authorities imposed a round-the-clock curfew to prevent infiltration by the militants. ""All the residents of neighborhoods near Jintilo have fled into the city due to the ongoing battle between troops and Boko Haram gunmen who want to enter the city,"" said Modu Zannari, who lives nearby. ""Boko Haram gunmen in their hundreds attacked Jintilo around 5 a.m., just before the morning prayers, but soldiers stationed there fought back,"" Zannari said . ""Since 5 a.m. all we hear are cracking of guns and booming explosions coming from the direction of Jintilo,"" said Babakaka Said, a resident of another neighborhood near the scene of the fighting. ""There have been radio announcements of indefinite curfew in the city and we have all been asked to remain indoors,"" said Adam Kolo‎, who lives in the heart of the city. Hundreds of troop reinforcements deployed in Jintilo and military jets carried out aerial bombardment of Boko Haram positions, said a member of a civilian vigilante group fighting Boko Haram alongside troops. ""The ‎gunmen have been dealt with and are now on the run, but they are being pursued by soldiers and vigilantes with the aerial support of a military jet,"" said the vigilante, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the incident. The attack came a day after President Goodluck Jonathan made a campaign stop in Maiduguri ahead of the February 14 presidential election. He has promised to end the Boko Haram insurgency if re-elected. On Friday, Boko Haram attacked Kambari village, 5 kilometers from Maiduguri, killing 15 people and burning homes, in what was seen as a prelude to a possible onslaught on the city. Also Friday, Boko Haram released 192 hostages, mostly women, who had been kidnapped from a village in Yobe state following a deadly raid, according to community leaders, a local politician and a military source. The hostages had been held in two Boko Haram enclaves since a January 6 raid on the village of Katarko, 20 kilometers from the state capital, Damaturu, in which 218 women and children were abducted, according to sources. ""Boko Haram have returned to us our 192 women they took away at the beginning of this month‎. They freed them on Friday and dropped them at Girbuwa (village) near Damaturu,"" Diptcha Aisami, a community leader in Katarko, said. The hostages were released after they declined to fight alongside Boko Haram, which branded them infidels, said a local politician from Katarko. ""They (Boko Haram) are still holding 26 young boys they abducted along with the released hostages in Katarko,"" said the politician, who asked not to be named for security reasons. A military officer confirmed the release of the hostages by Boko Haram.‎ . On January 6, dozens of Boko Haram gunmen stormed Katarko, where they killed 25 men and threw the bodies in open wells, burned the entire village and kidnapped the women and children, according to Aisami and local vigilantes. The attack was apparently in reprisal for a raid on a Boko Haram enclave by local hunters and vigilantes in Buni Yadi, 20 kilometers away, hours earlier. Several Boko Haram fighters were killed in that raid; scores of others were arrested and an arsenal was seized, according to vigilantes. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.","Boko Haram takes control of Monguno and its huge military barracks, military says .

"Just call it the Fake Leap Forward. In a satirical ""Communist rally"" aimed at mainland Chinese shoppers, about 100 Hong Kongers marched through the city on Sunday wearing Maoist costumes, yelling ""love your country, buy Chinese products!"" Others held posters of Mao Zedong, branded with the mock-patriotic slogan ""Chinese people should drink Chinese milk"" -- a dig at the throngs of mainland shoppers who enter Hong Kong to buy its infant formula, which is viewed as safer than Chinese infant formula. Filled with apparent glee, protesters mockingly bellowed the Chinese national anthem off-key, and thrust Mao's ""Little Red Book"" into the air.

"(CNN) -- Japanese writer and director Hideo Nakata has been hailed as the modern master of macabre. The master of macabre, Hideo Nakata didn't start out in film aiming to make horror movies. His 1998 film ""Ringu"" -- adapted from a novel by Suzuki Koji, the Japanese Steven King -- redefined the horror genre, propelled Nakata into the international spotlight and soon had Hollywood calling. Born in Okayama, Japan, in 1961, Nakata enrolled at the University of Tokyo to study journalism. On graduating he went on to work in Japan's Nikkatsu Studios, the same place where renowned director Akira Kurosawa started out. He didn't' start out aiming to make horror films, but it was Nikkatsu Studios that Nakata met Hiroshi Takahashi, the screenplay writer for ""Ringu."" An international hit, ""Ringu"" centers on a cursed videotape that kills whoever watches it. It appeared in cinemas at the same time mainstream western horror films were churning out gruesome violence as the means to get audiences hiding behind their popcorn. Nakata's artfully directed and terrifying film was a nether-world away from these schlock horror and slasher flicks, instead utilizing suspense and a pervading sense of dread. Western audiences expecting to watch good-looking teenagers getting chopped up in a blizzard of gore were treated to something much creepier. For Hollywood producers, Nakata has been a gold-mine of remake material. If dread is the word that has become synonymous with Nakata's work, there was a great sense of it among many of Nakata's fans when it was announced that there would be a Hollywood remake of ""Ringu,"" starring Naomi Watts. Despite fans claiming that the terror of the original was lost in translation, Nakata himself was given the opportunity to direct the Hollywood sequel, ""The Ring 2,"" in 2005. The series' success has spawned a third installment, due to be released in 2009 that Nakata will also be directing. Shunning computer generated monsters or gallons of fake-blood and guts, ""Ringu"" and other Nakata films including ""Dark Water,"" which was also remade by Hollywood in 2005, use glimpses of mysterious abstract images -- a reflection in a TV screen, an unsettling, spreading damp patch of water -- to ratchet up the terror. Fans and critics have compared the chilling atmosphere of his films with that of Roman Polanski's work, in ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Tenant."" Nakata then has been credited with turning on a whole new audience to Asian horror films with an altogether more subtle approach to scaring the wits out of people. He reveals the finer points of his scare tactics to Anjali Rao on Talk Asia this weekend. E-mail to a friend .","Director of Japanese horror film ""Ringu"" has redefined a genre .

"Paula Creamer has gained a lot from golf. At the age of just 25, she has already earned nearly $9 million. But the American, dubbed the ""Pink Panther"" due to her on-course attire and love of a certain fluffy toy, also gives a lot back in return. ""If you ask me who's Paula Creamer, the golfer, I'll tell you I'm the player who wants to give back to kids as much as I can,"" she told CNN Mexico. The 2010 U.S. Open champion dedicates a lot of time, and money, to helping future generations make their way in the game as she has done. ""It's one of the most humbling experiences I've ever had,"" the world No. 6 said. ""There's more to the game when you're playing in front of kids. ""Golf is about the young kids, it is about growing the game, letting it play 100, 200 years from now."" That's why she has invested part of the $8.7 million she has earned on the LPGA Tour in helping others. For instance, she has offered scholarships at Florida's IMG Leadbetter Golf Academy, which she attended. The sky is the limit . One of the kids Creamer has worked with is Ana Claudia Rodriguez, an 11-year-old who plays at Mexico's Guadalajara Country Club, the same course where two-time major winner Lorena Ochoa grew up. ""Paula has motivated me with advice and I have been playing better golf ever since I met her,"" she said. ""I've won five tournaments on different (Mexican) courses."" Rodriguez is the only girl to have won the award for best student at the Guadalajara Country Club golf academy. ""Paula is interested in my education, she asks me what (scores) I'm shooting and tells me that the most important thing is to have fun, to have a good attitude, but most importantly, to have a good time whenever I play golf."" Rodriguez only gets to see Creamer once a year, when the LPGA circuit comes to Mexico for the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in Guadalajara. She and her brother Santiago skip school -- with their parents' permission -- to get a glimpse of their favorite player. The most significant thing Creamer has shared with Ana and Santiago, besides several gifts like balls, caps and even the Pink Panther she carries on her bag, is to ""never give up ... The sky is the limit to achieve your dreams."" Inspire others . At the age of eight, Julie Steinbauer never imagined that meeting Creamer -- who at the time was 17 -- would change her life. Creamer was playing the Junior Orange Bowl International Championship in Coral Gables, Florida, but food poisoning forced her to withdraw. ""She went out to watch,"" Steinbauer remembers. ""I hung out with her and she was very nice to me the whole time."" Two months later, ""I went up to the David Leadbetter Golf Academy and practiced with her for a couple days."" However, it wasn't until she started playing golf in high school she realized how much of an impact Creamer had made in her life. Steinbauer could have been interested in one of the other 140 golfers that play regularly on the LPGA, but says ""Paula is very relatable. ""She is young, energetic, and very kind... now I can always think back and remember how dedicated she was in high school."" One of the most valuable pieces of advice Cramer gave Steinbauer was to respect the rules. ""I was playing with a friend of mine in a tournament and she tried to get away with cheating until I stopped her. ""Paula wrote me back saying, 'I heard that you had some rules problems but you did the right thing.  Never let someone get away with breaking the rules, even if they are your friend. It might be one of the hardest things to do, but the rules are there for a reason.'"" Education is the cornerstone . Joseph McKenney, 19, studies engineering at Embry-Riddle University, in Daytona, Florida. He knows that without Creamer his academic life might have not been the same. ""Without her generous financial support, I seriously doubt that I would be halfway through my second year at a private engineering college,"" he said. At 13, when McKenney was in 8th grade, Paula offered two one-year scholarships to attend the Leadbetter academy, located in Bradenton, Florida. McKenney competed with five other kids and, after several interviews and essays addressed to the Creamers, he got the financial aid. His progress, on and off the course, was so good that Paula decided to extend the scholarship through the rest of high school -- another three years. Besides playing golf at the academy, McKenney ""realized that my career goal was to become a golf course architect."" His admiration for Creamer grew quickly as he realized that she was determined to help others off the course. ""Paula and her family were also actively involved in our local chapter of The First Tee (a youth development program). Each year, they would help us to raise money for it,"" he said. Now, McKenney analyzes the way Creamer handles media. ""She was always so poised, looking directly into the camera, and speaking clearly.

Christina Basara lives in Oklahoma City, but she has not been able to attend an LPGA event. Nevertheless, Creamer is a huge inspiration to her.

Her coach, Stephanie, is responsible for introducing her into Creamer's world. Her husband Doug, an LPGA rules official, contacted the golfer and her family. ""She wrote a note to me and what it says is 'practice hard and have fun' ... she gave me her shag bag with a lot of pink golf balls,"" Christina said. Heather, the girl's mother, believes Paula is an example of ""a woman who has worked hard to be able to do what she enjoys most.""

"If your romantic partner pointed you to an application for a one-way trip to Mars, would you be upset -- or thrilled? When Dr. Leila Zucker's husband sent her such an e-mail last spring, he said that he didn't want her to go but that he'd be a lousy husband if he didn't tell her about it. Fast-forward to today: Zucker has made it past the first round of cuts for Mars One, a nonprofit organization that aims to send four people to the Red Planet in 2024 and subsequent groups in later years. ""Most of us want to explore, want to go new places, and then it's just a question of: How much are you willing to give up to do it?"" she said. Zucker is one of 705 candidates selected from a pool of 200,000 applicants for the mission. The select group has been narrowed from 1,058 people as some prospective astronauts dropped out for personal or medical reasons, Mars One said recently. All of the remaining candidates will be interviewed by the Mars One selection committee. Eventually, only four will be picked for the first trip. Apparently, none of them is scared off by the idea that, because of technological and financial limitations, Mars One astronauts would probably never come home. It might not actually happen . Despite growing excitement surrounding this effort, it is not clear that sufficient money will be raised to follow through. Mars One CEO Bas Lansdorp has said the company is looking at ""a range of funding scenarios."" A reality TV concept is one way Mars One may make good on its $6 billion budget for getting the first four humans to Mars. Lansdorp hopes the unprecedented video opportunities will attract sponsors, partners and media coverage. But since no one has ever been to Mars, the technology to fly people there and keep them alive has not been tested there, either. Lansdorp said last year that ""no new inventions are needed to land humans on Mars,"" and the website says the ""plan is built upon existing technologies available from proven suppliers."" But the company will need to show that key systems involved in transportation and life support will work in untraversed territories. Mars One announced in March that it will soon begin constructing the first of its ""simulation outposts"" to train selected astronauts and teams, giving them experience in an environment made to feel like a Martian home. Zucker, 46, an emergency medicine physician in Washington, is doubtful that Mars One will deliver on the trip at all. But if it does happen, she is on board. ""There's no question."" Settling away from your spouse . You might think that trying to emigrate from our planet might put some pressure on Earth-based relationships. Zucker and her husband have been married for 21 years and have no children. If she goes to Mars, she said, she will probably offer her husband a divorce but will wear her wedding ring regardless. He doesn't want her to go, she said, but supports her following her dreams. ""Both of us are space enthusiasts,"" she said. ""Humanity needs to expand off Earth if we expect the human race to succeed in any way beyond just basic survival."" Dan Carey, 52, another candidate, also believes humans should be spreading to other planets -- but his wife is not happy about Carey taking part in the mission. The couple, married 28 years, has two college-age children. ""She's concerned that she's going to have to watch me die on television,"" Carey said of his wife. It's hard for Carey to think about leaving his wife and kids behind forever and never meeting future grandchildren. Still, he likes the idea of making history and seeing things that no one has seen directly before. Sachin Desai and his wife, Ankita Ritwik, are getting around the marital tension issue by applying together. Desai says he could not go to Mars without her. Sure, Mars might challenge their marriage, but enough marriages are strained on Earth already, he said. ""One thing we do really well together is travel, and this would be a trip lasting the rest of our lives. I think we also are very good at helping each other out when we are stressed; I would be a far worse space cadet without her."" A 'social experiment' When you live far from people you've known for a long time, you manage to make friends in your immediate area, and that's what Marina Santiago thinks will happen on Mars. The Harvard University Ph.D. student says Mars One crew members may take the place of friends, family and significant others. Even if Mars One doesn't land people on Mars in 2025, it serves as a ""social experiment"" to get people talking and thinking about a Mars mission, she said. ""What I learned in grad school is that you never really know what problems you're going to come across until you actually try and do something. And the fact that they're actually trying to plan it, means that they'll come across the problems,"" she said. ""I believe that there are no problems humanity can't solve."" Some candidates draw analogies to the early waves of European settlers in North America. Immigrants didn't have a rover on Plymouth Rock telling them about local conditions before they arrived, says Gregory Sachs. ""You even couldn't necessarily send a letter back to your family,"" Zucker said. ""You were leaving everything for good. We at least will have the ability to use e-mail."" Still, it's a hard sell for friends of Brian Robles', a Mars One candidate who studies public health at Rutgers University. ""Usually, every time I tell somebody about the trip, they say it's a 'suicide mission' and 'you're going to die on Mars,' "" Robles said.  ""Well, we're going to die here, too. So might as well live your whole life to the fullest."" Funny he should mention that: The United Arab Emirates' religious watchdog, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs & Endowments, recently issued a fatwa to warn Muslims against the mission because ""the chances of dying are higher than living."" Mars One responded in a statement, asking the authority to cancel the fatwa. ""The Fatwa prohibits Muslims from going to Mars, but not from applying to Mars One's mission or training for the mission. In the next ten years, Mars One is open to working with the GAIAE to assess the risk of the mission as the unmanned settlement is under construction,"" Mars One said. Sachs is hopeful that his trip wouldn't actually be one-way. He believes it would be in the best interest of the mission to send the astronauts back: ""Imagine only the cost and tax on resources to care with someone elderly on a Mars One colony,"" he said. But the way that the mission is currently set up -- with no return plan -- he's still interested. Making happy Martian meals . Spending the rest of your life on another planet might make a person miss certain Earthly conveniences like favorite foods. Carey said he'd lose weight just to be able to take more chocolate with him, since there would be a limit of how much weight each person could contribute to the mission. Michael McDonnell, another applicant, said he wants to make the first pizza on Mars. Zucker would miss hamburgers but has high hopes for being able to grow them herself, perhaps from cow stem cells using a technique demonstrated last year. How test-tube meat could be the future of food . ""The first hardest thing to give up would obviously be my husband,"" Zucker said. ""The second hardest thing would be meat."" But for this opportunity, she would kiss them both goodbye.

"The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a resolution on Libya on Wednesday that calls for an immediate ceasefire and includes sanctions for those involved in violence there. The Security Council's move came amid worsening conflict in Libya -- and a day after the Pentagon said it believes Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have been conducting secret airstrikes in the North African nation. That claim has been denied by Egyptian leaders and apparently dismissed by a UAE minister. The allegation was first made at the weekend by militants from an alliance of Islamist and Misrata militias -- known as the Libya Dawn forces -- who have been battling rival moderate militias from the western city of Zintan. The alliance wrested control of Tripoli International Airport from the Zintan militia groups Saturday night after airstrikes targeting locations held by their own forces. The claims of outside military intervention have sparked fears that Libya has become the latest arena in a regional battle for influence between Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE on one hand and Turkey and Qatar on the other. Libya continues to be beset by instability -- politically, militarily and otherwise -- nearly three years after the revolution that toppled former strongman leader Moammar Gadhafi. That has included extensive violence, much of it involving increasingly powerful militias that have outgunned the nation's central government. Late last month, the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, the United Nations and other international organizations and businesses evacuated their staffs due to the unrest. The U.N. resolution calls for an end to the fighting and for those responsible to be held accountable. It also urges ""all parties to engage in an inclusive Libyan-led political dialogue in order to help restore stability, and to forge consensus around the next steps in Libya's transition."" The resolution does not mention any claims of bombing by outside forces. U.S. urges political process . Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, confirmed at a briefing Tuesday that the United States believes that airstrikes were undertaken in recent days by the UAE and Egypt inside Libya but declined to give further details. Asked if the Pentagon supported independent action by the UAE and Egypt in Libya, he said it, like the U.S. government, wants Libya's problems to be resolved ""peacefully, and through good governance and politics and not violence, and that we discourage other nations from taking a part in Libya's issues through violence."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki gave a similar message, saying, ""We understand that there were airstrikes undertaken in recent days by the UAE and Egypt."" She pointed to a joint statement issued Monday by the U.S., UK, French, German and Italian governments which calls for an immediate ceasefire in Libya by all sides and engagement in the democratic process. ""We believe outside interference in Libya exacerbates current divisions and undermines Libya's democratic transition,"" the statement concludes. The United States doesn't believe there is a military solution in Libya, Psaki said. ""The political process is what the focus needs to be on. And, hence, the concern that we have."" In a tweet later Tuesday, Psaki appeared to seek to clarify her earlier remarks. ""Comment today on Libya intended to refer to countries reportedly involved, not speak for them,"" she said. Egypt 'has no forces in Libya' Egypt has repeatedly denied any military involvement in Libya. ""Egypt is not involved in any military activity and it does not have any military presence on Libyan territories,"" Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Tuesday. ""We respect the Libyan people's will represented by the parliament and all its decisions."" Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Badr Abdellatty told CNN on Monday that suggestions Egypt was involved in recent airstrikes are ""nonsense."" A day earlier, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi also denied any Egyptian involvement in Libya, according to the official Egyptian news agency, MENA. He told newspaper chiefs that are no Egyptian aircraft or forces in Libya and that no Egyptian aircraft took any military action inside Libyan territory. El-Sisi added that Egypt, like its neighbors, is interested in the safety and security of Libya and has been consulting with Algeria and Tunisia and others over political action to achieve stability there. The UAE has not given an official response to the allegation it was involved in airstrikes. But UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to dismiss the initial claim by Libyan Islamists in remarks on Twitter, translated by CNN. ""The attempt to drag the UAE into the Libyan issue is an escape from facing the results of the elections and the legitimacy that it brought about and the desire of the majority in Libya for stability and security,"" he said in one tweet. His comment referred to elections in June that brought a new anti-Islamist government to power in Libya. However, the new administration has so far proved ill-equipped to quell the violence plaguing Libya.","U.N. Security Council resolution includes sanctions for those involved in violence in Libya .

"This week, Canada became the latest country to join the U.S.-led fight against ISIS when its lawmakers voted Tuesday to contribute aircraft and personnel in the battle, though Prime Minister Stephen Harper stressed Canada will not commit ground troops. ISIS has seized large swaths of land in its quest to create a caliphate -- an Islamic state -- that stretches from western Syria to eastern Iraq. Turkey joined the coalition late last week as the militants continued to fight Kurdish and Iraqi forces on the ground. In September, the United States promised broad cooperation in the effort against the terror group.  So far, Great Britain, France, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and other nations are participating. Here's a closer look at their roles. Regional allies . Saudi Arabia: On September 17, in a speech to service members at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, U.S. President Barack Obama said that Saudi Arabia had ""agreed to host our efforts to train and equip Syrian opposition forces"" to fight ISIS. In late September, Saudi Arabia joined the coalition in airstrikes in Syria, attacks that hit ISIS vehicles and logistics bases, Centcom said. And last month, U.S. officials said that Saudi Arabia had offered to train on its soil moderate Syrian rebels who would fight ISIS. Saudi Arabia has also put $500 million into the coffers of the U.N. humanitarian aid agencies in Iraq, a senior State Department official said Sunday. United Arab Emirates: The UAE helped launch airstrikes in Syria. The country's first female fighter pilot led one of the missions. Turkey: Though the NATO member initially offered only tacit support for the coalition, Turkey's government recently authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations, including ISIS, as the militant group's fighters took towns just south of Turkey's border. Foreign troops have also been allowed to launch attacks against ISIS from Turkey.  U.S. officials said it had earlier taken steps to cut the flow of money to ISIS and denied entry to or deported several thousand foreign fighters heading to Syria to join the extremists. The nation's role in the fight against ISIS has stirred controversy, particularly last week when U.S. Vice President Joe Biden apologized to Turkey and UAE leaders for comments in a speech at Harvard, when he said the Middle East allies had inadvertently strengthened ISIS by helping opposition groups fight Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Jordan: The kingdom participated in airstrikes in Syria. In mid-September, former Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher said on CNN that he doubted Jordan will commit ground troops in the fight against ISIS. ""The U.S. will have to take the lead in providing military strikes,"" he said. One of Jordan's key roles would be providing intelligence to the West, Muasher said. Speaking from Amman, he stressed that Jordan's intelligence on ISIS is ""second to none."" Egypt: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has said Egypt has a critical role to play in countering ISIS ideology. There was a ""very detailed conversation with the Egyptians about military-to-military cooperation"" in Iraq, State Department officials said in September. There appear to be no public details about the role Egypt has played, however. But signaling a major cultural push against ISIS, Egypt's grand mufti condemned the terror group last month, saying that its actions are not in line with Islam, Al-Arabiya reported. Qatar: The small but very rich Gulf nation that hosts one of the largest American bases in the Middle East has flown a number of humanitarian flights, State Department officials said. And in late September, in his first-ever interview as the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani vowed to support the coalition. Qatar has been accused of funding terrorism, which the Emir dismissed. ""We don't fund extremists,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""If you talk about certain movements, especially in Syria and Iraq, we all consider them terrorist movement."" Of the coalition, he said, ""We've been asked by our American friends if we can join, and we did."" Iraqi Kurdistan: . The Kurdish fighting force, the Peshmerga, is battling ISIS on the ground in Syria and Iraq. Leaders of the semiautonomous region of Iraq are willing to send their Peshmerga forces to fight beyond their borders if there's a comprehensive international strategy put in place, President Masoud Barzani told CNN's Anna Coren. Three Americans are fighting alongside Kurdish forces against in northern Syria, a spokesman for the Kurdish group told CNN. Live CNN coverage has captured some of the bloodiest battles between the Kurds and ISIS. Bahrain: The oil-wealthy Gulf nation east of Saudi Arabia has participated in airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria. Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed al Khalifa, speaking on CNN in September, called ISIS a ""deviated cult"" that must be fought. Bahrain has had close relations with the United States for years, and the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet in based in Bahrain. Western allies . United Kingdom: Last week, the UK launched its first airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, striking targets four days after its Parliament approved the country's involvement. British planes helped Kurdish troops who were fighting ISIS in northwestern Iraq, dropping a bomb on an ISIS heavy weapon position and shooting a missile at an armed pickup truck, the UK's Defence Ministry said. British planes had been involved in reconnaissance missions over Iraq. Prime Minister David Cameron has called ISIS ""a menace""  and said the UK would help arm Kurdish forces, support the Iraqi government, keep supplying humanitarian help and coordinate with the United Nations to battle ISIS. ""This is not about British combat troops on the ground,"" he said Sunday, ""it is about working with others to extinguish this terrorist threat."" Read more: Britain vows to 'confront' ISIS . Australia: Australian aircraft started flying over Iraq in support of allied operations, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Parliament in Canberra on October 1. The Australian mission consists of inflight refueling and electronic surveillance in support of the U.S. and other allies. The country also authorized the deployment of Australian special forces into Iraq to ""advise and assist"" Iraqi forces, Abbott said, calling it a ""combat deployment"" but an ""essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of Iraq and ultimately the people of Australia from the murderous rage of the ISIL death cult.""  ISIL is another acronym for ISIS. Australian authorities believe that there are at least 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East alongside terrorist groups, chiefly ISIS, and that at least 100 more support terrorist groups through funding and recruitment. Counterterrorism police have carried out raids in Australia in recent days. In mid-September, two men were charged in connection with a terror plot that Abbott said involved plans for a ""demonstration killing.""  Australian media reported that the men planned to kidnap a member of the public, behead the victim and then drape him or her in an ISIS flag. France: French planes have taken part in airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, and the nation has flown reconnaissance flights over Iraq, contributed ammunition and made humanitarian drops over the nation. France's air force was also part of a recent operation in the Iraqi town of Amerli, along with Australia and Great Britain, that pushed back ISIS fighters. ISIS recently called for attacks against Western citizens, singling out ""the spiteful and filthy French"" for punishment. A video emerged last month of militants who have pledged allegiance to ISIS beheading Herve Gourdel, a French citizen who was kidnapped in Algeria. Germany: Geared toward curbing ISIS propaganda and recruitment, Germany has banned activities that support ISIS, including making it illegal to fly the trademark black flag of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Germany has also said it was sending military assistance to the Kurdish region to fight ISIS. Read more: How ISIS makes $1 million a day . Obama said on September 17 that German paratroopers are offering training in the overall effort to fight ISIS. Canada: The lower house of Parliament voted Tuesday to contribute aircraft and personnel in the fight against ISIS. In September, a State Department official said that Canada has provided ""tangible equipment and ammunition"" to the broader effort to fight ISIS. Read more: How ISIS lures Westerners . The Netherlands: This week, the Dutch military said two F-16s dropped bombs on armed ISIS vehicles in northern Iraq that were shooting at Kurdish fighters. The ISIS vehicles were destroyed, the military said in a statement, and ISIS fighters were ""possibly killed."" In late September, the Dutch government said it would contribute six F-16 fighter jets as well 250 troops to join in anti-ISIS airstrikes and provide training to Iraqi as well as Kurdish troops. The F-16s would be based outside Iraq, it said then, and used against ISIS in Iraq during a phase that could last from six to 12 months, the nation's Defense Ministry said. Other nations: State Department officials have also listed Italy, Poland, Denmark, Albania and Croatia as having provided  equipment and ammunition in the fight against ISIS. New Zealand, Romania and South Korea were also named for providing humanitarian assistance, with officials noting that South Korea has given some $1.2 million.","Canada voted to contribute aircraft and personnel in battle against ISIS .

"A Japanese soldier who hunkered down in the jungles of the Philippines for nearly three decades, refusing to believe that World War II had ended, has died in Tokyo. Hiroo Onoda was 91 years old. In  1944, Onoda was sent to the small island of Lubang in the western Philippines to spy on U.S. forces in the area. Allied forces defeated the Japanese imperial army in the Philippines in the latter stages of the war, but Onoda, a lieutenant, evaded capture. While most of the Japanese troops on the island withdrew or surrendered in the face of oncoming American forces, Onoda and a few fellow holdouts hid in the jungles, dismissing messages saying the war was over. For 29 years, he survived on food gathered from the jungle or stolen from local farmers. After losing his comrades to various circumstances, Onoda was eventually persuaded to come out of hiding in 1974. His former commanding officer traveled to Lubang to see him and tell him he was released from his military duties. In his battered old army uniform, Onoda handed over his sword, nearly 30 years after Japan surrendered.. ""Every Japanese soldier was prepared for death, but as an intelligence officer I was ordered to conduct guerrilla warfare and not to die,"" Onoda told CNN affiliate, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""I had to follow my orders as I was a soldier."" He returned to Japan, where he received a hero's welcome, a figure from a different era emerging into post-war modernity. But anger remained in the Philippines, where he was blamed for multiple killings. The Philippines government pardoned him. But when he returned to Lubang in 1996, relatives of people he was accused of killing gathered to demand compensation. After his return to Japan, he moved to Brazil in 1975 and set up a cattle ranch. ""Japan's philosophy and ideas changed dramatically after World War II,"" Onoda told ABC. ""That philosophy clashed with mine so I went to live in Brazil."" In 1984, he set up an organization, Onoda Shizenjyuku, to train young Japanese in the survival and camping skills he had acquired during his decades in Lubang's jungles. His adventures are detailed in his book ""No Surrender: My Thirty-year War."" The Japan Times excerpted some of the book's highlights in 2007. Here is a sample: . -- ""Men should never compete with women. If they do, the guys will always lose. That is because women have a lot more endurance. My mother said that, and she was so right."" -- ""If you have some thorns in your back, somebody needs to pull them out for you. We need buddies. The sense of belonging is born in the family and later includes friends, neighbors, community and country. That is why the idea of a nation is really important."" -- ""Life is not fair and people are not equal. Some people eat better than others."" -- ""Once you have burned your tongue on hot miso soup, you even blow on the cold sushi. This is how the Japanese government now behaves toward the U.S. and other nations."" Onoda was born in March 1922 in Wakayama, western Japan, according to his organization. He was raised in a family with six siblings in a village near the ocean. Hiroyasu Miwa, a staff member of the organization that Onodo started in 1984, said Onodo died of pneumonia Thursday afternoon at St. Luke's Hospital in Tokyo. He had been sick since December. Ever the faithful soldier, Onoda did not regret the time he had lost. ""I became an officer and I received an order,"" Onodo told ABC. ""If I could not carry it out, I would feel shame. I am very competitive.""","Hiroo Onoda wouldn't accept Japan's World War II defeat until 1974 .

"Remember when flying used to be romantic and glamorous? No? Back in the '60s and '70s, the airline industry had its challenges, but it also offered a lot of perks that travelers pine for today. Like a full meal, served on real china, even in coach. Like food that was more home-cooking than pre-packaged snack. Like wide, comfy seats with plenty of leg room. It all made travelers feel like they were doing more than simply hurtling through the air from Point A to Point B in a metal tube. It made them feel pampered. Flying proved that they were privileged. Anthony Toth, host of the Pan Am Experience, offers visitors a chance to re-create that feeling aboard a Pan Am Boeing 747 without leaving Los Angeles. Toth admits that he's obsessed with Pan Am. Visitors to the tourist attraction can see a collection of memorabilia that he's collected his entire life, such as branded carry-on bags, colorful luggage tags and warm blankets. ""I restored everything to look like it did back in the era of the '70s, when Pan Am was sort of in its heyday,"" Toth said. The Pan Am Experience takes place in an airliner ""cabin"" designed to look like the jumbo jets that Pan Am flew back in the day. There's also a fake check-in counter. For aviation enthusiasts, it sure looks like fun. Settle into seats that make today's equivalent seem like furniture for hobbits. Watch flight attendants glide through the cabin in retro uniforms. They wear hats! They sport white gloves! They greet each boarding ""passenger"" with a glass of champagne! A time machine transports visitors to a day before humans ate with plastic sporks. The flight attendants will serve you a four-course meal, the old-fashioned way, with silverware. The only thing you can't do that you could do on planes back then is smoke. It will remind you how much the airline industry has changed. Yet there's one thing that hasn't changed: the sticker shock. Tickets for a Pan Am Experience ""flight"" range from about $200 to about $300. The popularity of the Pan Am brand remains strong, decades after the airline went belly-up. ABC even tried a TV series in 2011, starring Christina Ricci, about a group of Pan Am pilots and flight attendants who enjoyed the glamorous, globetrotting lifestyle of the emerging jet set in the 1960s. It appears the top-shelf passenger service of that era is gone forever, relegated to the likes of nostalgic TV dramas and specialty museums like the Pan Am Experience.

"Attorney General Eric Holder announced Thursday that he will resign after six years at the helm of the Justice Department. Holder has agreed to remain in his post until the confirmation of his successor. ""In the months ahead I will leave the Department of Justice,"" Holder said at the White House, thanking President Barack Obama for the ""greatest honor of my professional life."" Though he's stepping down, Holder said that ""he will never leave the work."" ""I will continue to serve and try to find ways to make our nation even more true to its founding ideals,"" he said, without offering any specifics. Obama stood next to Holder in the White House State Dining Room, praising the first African-American to serve as attorney general and who made civil rights and equal rights central components to his tenure at Justice. The President noted that his department prosecuted hundreds of terror cases, ""rooted out corruption and fought violent crime,"" tackled financial fraud and ""attacks on the Voting Rights Act."" Obama said Holder also helped to bring down the crime rate and incarceration rate by 10% over the last six years. ""Eric has done a superb job,"" Obama said. ""I just want to say thank you."" In a telephone interview with CNN's Evan Perez before the official announcement, Holder said he never intended to stay for the duration of Obama's second term. He said now was the appropriate time to step down -- a time when things are going smoothly at the department. ""I'm confident we're in a good place,"" Holder said. ""Now was a good time to go [with] those accomplishments in the last few years in place."" He points to Justice's role in the aftermath of the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. He has also stated that protecting voters' rights and gay rights, easing federal drug sentencing rules that he argues disproportionately burden minorities and defending the use of criminal courts to try terrorist suspects are critical issues. ""I think I go out having accomplished a great deal in the areas that are of importance to me. I'm satisfied with the work we have done,"" he said. Eric Holder's legacy . Holder has discussed his plans to step down personally with the President on multiple occasions in recent months, and finalized those plans in an hour-long conversation with Obama at the White House residence over Labor Day weekend, an Obama administration official said. Holder noted that he has loved the Justice Department since, when he was a boy, he watched how -- under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy -- the Justice Department played a leadership role in advancing the civil rights movement. During his tenure as attorney general, Holder has had Kennedy's portrait in his conference room. Feds launch probe of Ferguson police department . Controversy . Holder also has been criticized as being overtly political, and some Republican members of Congress are shedding few tears over his resignation. For instance, Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina tweeted, ""Good riddance Eric Holder. Your disregard for the Constitution of the United States will not be missed."" House Speaker John Boehner released a similar statement, saying Holder's resignation is ""long overdue."" Some congressional Republicans have accused the attorney general of defying the 2013 Supreme Court ruling in Shelby v. Holder, which struck down a component of the Voting Rights Act, and they investigated him over Operation Fast and Furious. In Fast and Furious, the so-called gun-walking operation, roughly 2,000 guns were allowed into Mexico with the goal of tracking them to Mexican drug cartels. Two guns found at the scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry's fatal shooting in December 2010 were linked to the operation. In June 2012, the House voted to hold Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents linked to that operation. Upon hearing the news of Holder's resignation, House Oversight Committee Chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, who lead the contempt proceedings, called Holder ""the most divisive U.S. Attorney General in modern history."" Who might replace Eric Holder? Partisan support . But Holder has his supporters, including the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""I particularly appreciate how Attorney General Holder has restored the Civil Rights Division to its historical mission,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont said. Lawmakers weigh in on Eric Holder's resignation . Leahy also pointed to the attorney general's work on sentencing reforms and efforts to reduce recidivism rates. Those sentiments were echoed by Rep. Marcia Fudge, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. She said Holder's departure ""will leave a significant void in this administration and in our nation."" Tenure . The attorney general is one of only three remaining members of Obama's original Cabinet. In 2013, Holder described his first meeting with Obama, which occurred just after Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004.

"(CNN)Jurors will get to see Aaron Hernandez's trophy case when they visit his home during the former New England Patriots star's murder trial, a judge ruled recently. The visit may happen Friday. The Assistant District Attorney asked the court for permission to hide the trophy case, indicating the defense was trying to engage in ""strategic manipulation"" or impress the jury with trophies or medals. The defense's position was simple: That's the way the house looked when the alleged victim was killed ... and that's how it should be shown. Trophy cases aside, the rest of us defense attorneys and prosecutors must be wondering about a threshold issue: . What's with the jury excursions in these kinds of cases? This doesn't happen in most trials.  Why the special treatment? The decision whether to grant a ""jury view"" rests, as with many things, in the sound discretion of a trial judge.  Courts, meaning judges, have the inherent power to allow a jury in either a civil or a criminal case to view places or objects outside the courtroom. Whether to permit a jury to conduct a view in a particular situation is a question committed to the trial court's informed discretion. Practically, what that likely means is, the judge just conducts a balancing test by weighing ""what's the point?"" against ""do I really feel like going out in the cold for a jury view?""  This calculus usually yields the following result in a run-of-the-mill case: motion denied. There is a growing bifurcation of the criminal trial system and it has nothing to do with race.  It has nothing to do either with the wealth of the defendant.  Simply put, there is a growing chasm between the way regular trials are conducted and the way high-profile trials are conducted. Most murder trials do not conduct jury views of the murder scene.  On one hand, parties should be able to request jury views where it would be important for a jury to view a scene in person, and photographs or video are inadequate substitutes. Of course, on the other hand, establishing a defendant's absolute right to a jury viewing would not work either, because parties would inevitably abuse the system; the courthouse would look like a yellow bus depot dispatching a fleet of juries on field trips: depressing, macabre field trips. As gruesome as the facts are, the Hernandez case is not all that different from thousands of other murder prosecutions, except that it is a trial being covered by the media.  Coverage means scrutiny. Scrutiny means the judge and the lawyers on either side will err on the side of caution.  Erring on the side of caution means motions and requests will be considered that would not ordinarily be considered. It's a common misconception that only rich or famous defendants get this special consideration by the courts, but that's not the case at all.  Jodi Arias was an indigent, noncelebrity defendant, and Arizona squandered half its GDP considering every request from both sides in that case.  Race really isn't a factor either.  George Zimmerman's trial judge entertained many creative motions from both sides, and, contrary to initial reports, he is Latino. High profile cases are terrific for both legal professionals and the general public, because parties are allowed to develop arguments they otherwise might not be allowed to make in an ordinary case.  But it also gives the public a false impression: They don't get a sense of the conveyor belt fashion in which the vast majority of criminal trials are conducted. There are two tiers of justice emerging in the United States.  You don't need to be a celebrity defendant to have access to the subtle accommodations of a high-profile case. You can be an unknown person, as long as you meet certain criteria.  You have to be attractive (Jodi Arias or Scott Peterson).  You have to inspire a controversial racial dialogue (George Zimmerman or Officer Darren Wilson).  Or, as Hernandez or O.J. Simpson can tell us—having a career in the NFL doesn't hurt either.","Danny Cevallos: Celebrity trials are vastly different from the justice most people see .
In a case like that of Aaron Hernandez, judges may be more willing to take a field trip ."
"(CNN)Rescue workers are trying to find eight people still missing from the TransAsia Airways plane that crashed into a river in Taiwan on Wednesday, amid concerns that some of them might have been swept away by currents. Thirty-five people have been confirmed dead from the crash of TransAsia Airways Flight GE235, and 15 people survived, many of them with injuries, according to Taiwan's official news agency, CNA. Two people on the ground were also hurt. Searchers continued to recover bodies of victims Friday, CNA reported, citing Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration. Pieces of wreckage from the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop aircraft have been hauled out of the Keelung River in Taipei,  the Taiwanese capital. Rescuers fear those people still unaccounted for may have drifted downstream toward the larger Tamsui River. Divers have put up a net about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the crash site to try to catch the missing bodies, authorities said. Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou visited the injured in the hospital on Thursday and also went to a funeral parlor to express his condolences, his office said. Some of the survivors have begun to give their accounts of the disaster in which the aircraft veered out of control shortly after taking off en route to Kinmen, a group of islands near the coast of the Chinese province of Fujian, then clipped a bridge before plunging into the river. And a recording from the cockpit of the plane captured someone making a mayday call because of an engine problem shortly before the crash. Huang Chin-shun, a 72-year-old survivor, told CNN affiliate ETTV from his hospital bed that he sensed something was amiss soon after takeoff. ""I thought something's wrong with the engine because I always take this flight,"" he said. ""There was a girl beside me, and I told her to quickly release her safety belt, hold on tight to the chair in front, and cover her head with clothes,"" Huang told the broadcaster. ""It was not long after I told her this that the plane went down."" After the crash, he said, he helped pull several people out of the submerged wreckage, injuring himself in the process. The plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered and their contents downloaded, said Wang Hsing-chung, the managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council. Investigators are analyzing the data from the so-called black boxes and may release key parts of the information Friday, Wang said. But the full analysis is expected to take months. In the meantime, bits and pieces of information have come out that shed light on the aircraft's final moments. They include a male voice on a recording of radio conversations between air traffic control and Flight GE235 who says, ""GE235. Mayday, mayday. Engine flameout."" The recording was verified by LiveATC.net, which records air traffic control feeds around the world. It is unclear whether the man was a pilot. The plane's cockpit crew were among those confirmed dead, authorities said. A pilot who once flew ATRs for American Airlines said it looked like the plane was gliding when dash-cam video from several angles captured the moments of the crash. Stephen Fredrick pointed to the position of the nose, slightly down, and the wings, level. ""As it gets closer to the highway, there's a change in the pitch attitude (position of the plane) and it appears the aircraft (left) wing stalls, or loses lift. That's what causes the dramatic turn to the left,"" Fredrick told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""It's what causes the aircraft to come down more forcefully and crash."" The plane was 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the airport, Fredrick said, at a point where the pilots should have been able to continue with the flight even if one engine failed. The distance indicated to him that the engine problem occurred well after takeoff. ""It appears that it could have had a single-engine flameout, it could have had a dual-engine flameout,"" he said. ""Those are things we're going to learn."" The left propeller was also set to a position for flight, rather than to a position for an inoperable engine, he said. That could have caused drag and prompted the left wing to stall, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. Pilots normally before a flight will turn on a system that automatically adjusts the position of the propellers, the experts said. A dash-cam video captured the moment the plane hurtled out of control above the city's Nanhu Bridge before crashing into the river, just after 11 a.m. local time (10 p.m. ET). CNA reported that the pilot appeared to try to control the aircraft as it descended, but the aircraft's wing grazed the overpass, clipping a passing taxi. Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je said that after reading a report on Flight GE235's route, he was grateful to the plane's captain, who he said made efforts until the last moment to reduce casualties and damage. Ko said the situation could have been worse if the plane had crashed on the highway or hit nearby high-voltage electricity lines, according to a statement from the city government. ""He did his best,"" Ko was quoted as saying. Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration said it had ordered local airlines to carry out inspections on all their ATR 72s before they can fly again. The special checks will look at various aspects of the engine system, including fuel and propeller control. TransAsia has to inspect 10 planes, while another carrier, Uni Air, has to examine 12 aircraft, according to the agency. The plane that crashed was less than a year old and had last completed a safety check on January 26, it said. President Ma said the government must ""think things through and make improvements."" ""The government must strengthen aviation safety in the country and not let the same thing happen again,"" the statement from his office said. Hours after the crash, TransAsia Airways CEO Chen Xinde extended a ""deep apology to the victims and our crew."" He said 31 of the passengers aboard the flight were Chinese tourists, including three children. Twenty-two passengers were from Taiwan, including one child. The airline had sent the passenger manifest to authorities, and families were confirming the identities of the deceased, he said. TransAsia said Thursday that it has started to give families emergency condolence money of 200,000 Taiwanese dollars ($6,360) per victim. It said it would also give extra funds for funeral arrangements of 1.2 million Taiwanese dollars ($38,160) to families identifying bodies. The TransAsia crash is the latest in a number of plane disasters involving Asian carriers. AirAsia Flight QZ8501 crashed on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore. There were 162 people on board. In July, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard. TransAsia was involved in another deadly disaster in July of last year. Forty-eight people died on TransAsia Airways Flight 222, another ATR 72 aircraft, as it was attempting to land in the Taiwanese Penghu Islands during bad weather. TransAsia had lost two other ATR 72s previously -- one that crashed in the mountains in 1995, killing the four crew members on board, and one that crashed into the sea in 2002, killing the two pilots, according to CNA. The biggest recent mystery has been the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. It disappeared on March 8, 2014, and has not been found. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, David Molko and Katie Hunt, as well as journalist Andy Lee, contributed to this report.","At least 35 people were killed in the plane crash, Taiwan's official news agency says .

"(CNN)The robot revolution may be gentler than we thought. We're not sure if the robotic staff at a planned hotel in Japan will be tucking guests into their beds at night, but they'll be performing plenty of other traditional hospitality tasks. Huis Ten Bosch, a theme park modeled after the Netherlands in Japan's Nagasaki Prefecture, has announced plans to open a hotel with robot staff and other advanced technologies. The hotel will be called Henn-na Hotel, which translates as Strange Hotel. According to the park, the first phrase of the two-story hotel will open on July 17 with 72 rooms. The second phrase will be completed in 2016 with an additional 72 rooms. Operating under the motto ""A commitment for evolution,"" the hotel will feature three ""actroids"" (robots with strong human likeness) that will act as receptionists. They'll be able to engage in intelligent conversations with human guests. The hotel will also employ four service and porter robots, and others engaged in menial tasks such as cleaning. High-tech features keep prices low . ""We'll make the most efficient hotel in the world,"" boasts Huis Ten Bosch president Hideo Sawada. Sawada says he hopes robots will eventually run 90% of the property. ""In the future, we're hoping to build 1,000 similar hotels around the world,"" says Sawada, according to Japan's Nikkei News. Other features will help make Henn-na the most futuristic low-cost hotel in the industry, according to the company. Guestroom doors will be accessed by facial-recognition technology. Amenities provided in rooms will be kept minimal. Guests can request items through a tablet when needed. Instead of air-conditioning, a radiation panel will detect body heat in rooms and adjust the temperature. Solar power and other energy-saving features will be used to reduce operating costs. Bid for your room . Room rates will vary depending on demand. Instead of being presented with a fixed price, guests will bid for rooms during peak season. The highest bidders will secure rooms, though there will be a price cap on bidding. The hotel says room fees at opening will be from JPY7,000 ($60) for a single room to JPY18,000 ($153), the highest possible price after bidding, for a triple room. Superior and deluxe rooms will cost more. Guests can already reserve rooms online through the hotel's website.

"An expanding digital marketplace, financial stability and strong economic growth; Estonia is setting the pace for other European nations, according to the Baltic nation's leader. Speaking with CNN's Isa Soares, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves said that the country developed a reputation for its digital economy ""from a level playing field"" with other nations after it gained independence in 1993. ""We did, in the 1990s, look around us and see a lot of things that we needed to do in the world,"" he said. ""We were behind in many areas. When it came to IT... we were starting more or less at the same base as everyone else. We started with a tabula rasa, a clean slate.""

With the lowest government debt in Europe, Estonia's economy is also a beacon for financial prudence at a time when many European nations are struggling to cope with high government debt and low growth.

Read more: How saffron could save Greek farmers . Allan Sikk, an expert in Eastern Europe at the University College of London, said that Estonia's meteoric rise and assimilation into the West is partly due to the country emerging from the Soviet Union with a stronger economy than most of its counterparts. ""It was also close to some very rich countries like Finland and Sweden that provided export markets and investments."" Today, the Baltic nation is joining its affluent Nordic partners in financing the struggling countries of southern Europe.

But Ilves is hopeful that Europe's single currency area has emerged from the ""worst phase."" ""It will be a slow recovery, we won't be back to the go-go years of booming economies yet,"" he added, ""but if you look at our country and other countries that started the reforms early, they're doing better [and] growth is faster... so that's the proof.""","Estonia is projected to grow by 1.8% this year and 3% in 2014, outshining most of Europe including Germany and France.

"Seeking a middle ground between calls for tough military action and none at all, President Barack Obama said Thursday he was sending up to 300 military advisers to Iraq to help the embattled government hold off a lightning advance from the north by Sunni militants. Obama told White House reporters the goal was to prevent a civil war in Iraq that could destabilize the region, and also prevent creation of a terrorist safe haven in northern Iraq and neighboring Syria from which U.S. enemies could plan and launch attacks against American interests. At the same time, Obama sought to allay fears of a military escalation that could relaunch the eight-year war he halted by withdrawing U.S. troops in 2011. ""We have had advisers in Iraq through our embassy and we are prepared to send a small number of additional American military advisers -- up to 300 -- to assess how we can best train, advise and support Iraqi security forces going forward,"" the President said. ""American forces will not be returning to combat in Iraq but we will help Iraqis as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the Iraqi people, the region and American interests as well,"" he added. Obama also said his strategy meant that ""going forward, we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it."" Possible airstrikes . The language signaled possible airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)  fighters who have swept toward Baghdad in recent weeks. Senior administration officials told reporters after Obama's statement that the United States will be sending the advisers to multiple joint command locations in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq. Several initial teams of about a dozen special forces members from units in the region would begin arriving in Iraq soon, said one of the officials on a White House phone conference conducted on condition of anonymity. Earlier, several U.S. officials told CNN that the Pentagon proposed sending Green Berets, Army Rangers and Navy SEALs to Iraq  as military advisers and to collect intelligence. The term military adviser evokes memories of the Vietnam War, when the U.S. government used that label for initial American forces sent over in what ended up as a long and costly engagement. U.S. officials acknowledged the American military advisers would likely face danger based on their location. Boots on the ground . CNN military analyst Rick Francona said the decision amounts to U.S ""boots on the ground"" in Iraq, no matter how the administration characterizes it. ""This is the first step. This is how you get drawn into these situations,"" said Francona, adding that the mission must be clearly defined to avoid greater military involvement. In response to questions from reporters after his statement, Obama rejected criticism that bringing home troops from Iraq three years ago contributed to the current crisis, saying it was Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki who rejected a residual force agreement over the need for a core requirement that would immunize U .S. troops from local prosecution. Obama also made clear that he blamed al-Maliki for worsening Iraq's deep sectarian divide by failing to include Sunni and Kurdish interests in his policies. He called on a new Iraqi government recently elected to adopt more inclusive policies, and said he was sending Secretary of State John Kerry to the region to promote such an approach. U.S. sources say Kerry is expected to travel to Iraq soon. ""Unless there is a coming together and elimination of the mistrust and addressing of the sense of isolation of different segments of Iraqi society -- unless people are brought together in order to try to bring the country together it's going to be -- there is no single military solution,"" Kerry told reporters on Thursday. New government . On the White House call, a senior administration official said a main goal of the moves announced by Obama was to allow the constitutional process of setting up a new Iraqi government to occur within the legally required time frame. The freshly elected Parliament will choose a new prime minister and president, and the Obama administration has signaled the need for a different approach than the sectarian polices of al-Maliki. To conservative hawks in Congress, Obama's moves didn't go far enough. ""We are deeply concerned that the President continues to make political change in Iraq the prerequisite for greater U.S. military and other actions that could begin reversing the momentum of ISIS and improving the security situation in the country,"" said a statement by Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, two leading critics of what they consider to be the President's soft foreign policy. U.S. officials familiar with the Pentagon plan, who spoke to CNN on condition of not being identified, said the teams of military advisers would be placed around Iraq in the headquarters of Iraqi military brigades and tasked with gathering intelligence on ISIS forces, such as their location, numbers and weaponry. Such information could provide needed intelligence if Obama decides to proceed with airstrikes on ISIS fighters, as requested by Iraq. Baghdad tense as military seeks to halt ISIS militants' advance . Airstrikes an option . For days, military sources have said ISIS fighters are dispersed and mixed in with local populations, making them difficult to target precisely with airstrikes. Francona noted that the U.S. special forces would be ""in a great position to call in any air strikes"" if Obama decided to use that option, too. On Wednesday, the President met with congressional leaders and later with Kerry on the Iraq crisis, which has prompted GOP criticism of U.S. foreign policy in the hyper- partisan environment of an election year in Washington. According to a White House statement, Obama went over efforts to ""strengthen the capacity of Iraq's security forces to confront the threat"" from ISIS fighters, ""including options for increased security assistance."" Earlier, spokesman Jay Carney spelled out one limit to any help, saying: ""The President hasn't ruled out anything except sending U.S. combat troops into Iraq."" Congressional authorization . While the White House statement emphasized Obama would continue to consult with Congress, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the President ""basically just briefed us on the situation in Iraq and indicated he didn't feel he had any need for authority from us for the steps that he might take."" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California agreed with McConnell's assessment, adding she believed congressional authorization for military force in Iraq back in 2001 and 2003 still applied. A few hours earlier, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said they were working out details on possible U.S. steps that could include airstrikes on ISIS fighters. The two leaders agreed with senators on a budget subcommittee that the Iraq crisis amounted to a threat to U.S. interests in the region and, down the road, a possible threat to the homeland if northern Iraq and neighboring Syria become a safe haven for al Qaeda-affiliated Islamists. Kerry: U.S. would communicate with Iran, not work with it, against ISIS . Washington politics . Obama has advocated less unilateral U.S. intervention abroad than his predecessor, GOP President George W. Bush, who led America into wars in Iraq and Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Republicans hoping to win control of the Senate and maintain their House majority in the November election have sought to depict Obama's foreign policy as weak and ineffective. They claim that a U.S. failure to intervene more forcefully on behalf of Syrian opposition forces created an opening for the Sunni militant movement now marching toward Baghdad. House Speaker John Boehner, who attended the White House meeting with Obama a day earlier, told reporters on Thursday that the Iraq crisis amounted to a broader foreign policy failure by the  administration. ""When you look it is not just Iraq,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""It is Libya, it's Egypt, it's Syria. The spread of terrorism has increased exponentially under this President's leadership."" Administration officials blame Iraq's crisis on the failure of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to govern more inclusively over a nation with major sectarian divisions, especially between the Sunni-dominated north and Shia-dominated south. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said al-Maliki needs to be convinced that his retirement would be in his country's best interest. ""I think that most of us that have followed this are really convinced that the Maliki government, candidly, has got to go if you want any reconciliation,"" she said this week. Other Democrats grudgingly supported Obama's announcement. ""To help Iraqis contain the current violence and protect our national security interests, I support President Obama's decision to deploy a very limited number of advisers to Iraq for a non-combat training mission,"" said a statement Thursday by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. He said that ""any U.S. role in Iraq must remain sharply limited in scope,"" arguing that government funds should be for rebuilding infrastructure at home instead of more war in Iraq.

"(CNN)One person was killed Wednesday night when a small plane crashed into a television station's transmitter tower in Lubbock, Texas. The plane, a single-engine Piper PA-46, crashed about 7:30 p.m. as it approached Preston Smith International Airport, according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane hit the transmitter tower of KCBD, knocking both the station off the air and power out in the surrounding neighborhood, before crashing into a field. Lubbock fire officials feared the tower, located just north of the station's studio, was unstable and had the studio evacuated, CNN affiliate KCBD said. ""It is unsafe to stay in the building,"" said Steve Holland, a spokesman for the Lubbock Fire and Rescue Department. No one at the station was injured and KCBD aired its 10 p.m. Wednesday newscast from an alternate location. The name of the victim was not released by authorities. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. CNN's Sam Stringer and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","The plane crashed as it approached an airport .

"(CNN)These days, finding somewhere to live in London is one of the city's biggest challenges. The Greater London Authority estimates that 49,000 new homes are required in the UK capital every year to cope with its burgeoning population. In 2013, just under 20,000 new properties were built. With space tight and increasingly expensive, some are predicting micro-living -- residency in compact homes and apartments strategically designed to maximize usable space -- could become a common theme in the coming years. ""There's huge housing pressure,"" said Lucien Smithers, sales and marketing manager at Pocket, a micro-home developer. ""The last five years have seen a real population growth in London. We've just crossed 8.6 million and by 2030 we're going to be knocking on 10 million."" According to Smithers, shaving off excess space in new-build properties can squeeze more people in while still providing all the necessary amenities of city living -- although Pocket would argue that their 38 square meter properties (409 square feet) are perfectly proportioned. ""They don't have any car parking because (people) don't have cars anymore, they have space for bicycles. There's a big living area, and you know to be honest, you don't need a bath in your bathroom ... a wet room is exactly what's required,"" Smithers said of the properties. Pocket's development in London's transport zone two would sell for around $350,000, roughly 20% below market value. Special conditions ensure the properties maintain their status as affordable housing. ""All of the developments are prioritized for sale to people who live or work in the borough (local area). They have to earn under £66,000 ($100,000) and they can't already own another property,"" Smithers explained . Demand is far from in short supply. ""We currently have over 15,000 people registered for it, the demand is unbelievable,"" Smithers said. Yet even with these conditions, owning a home is still out of reach for many Londoners. This is a fact recognized by Reza Merchant, CEO of The Collective, another London micro home developer. ""We're now in a position where most people in their first or second jobs, in their early to late twenties can't even afford to rent a studio flat or one-bedroom flat,"" Merchant said. The Collective's Camden development is an upmarket hostel-style set up which is aimed at young professionals featuring small bedrooms, and shared communal spaces. Individual properties range from nine square meters rising to 20 square meters (97 sq ft to 215 sq ft). ""Our prices here start at about £200 ($304) a week,"" Merchant explained. ""That's all inclusive of all your utility bills, so your gas, your electricity, your council tax and then also the services ... the weekly linen change, the room cleaning, the concierge; it's an all-inclusive rent. ""People are happy to take smaller bedrooms as almost like crash pads,"" he added. Resident Bianca Pollio pays $425 dollars a week for 14 square meters (150 sq ft) and finds it suits her needs. ""When you live in a city and you're a student or a professional, you don't want to carry many things with you anyway. You want to be quite light,"" she said. The likes of Pocket and The Collective have caught the attention of businesses who are keen to keep their workers in the city. Pocket is popular with local authorities for providing living space for workers near to council offices while the Collective is in talks with KPMG to house its graduate workers. And despite the smaller spaces, neither skimps on the facilities. The Collective has a new 170,000 sq ft project in the works in London's Wilesden Junction area that will include common facilities like spas, libraries, secret garden rooms, discos, laundrettes and private dining rooms which people can hire out when they have dinner parties. ""I think it is a new, more permanent approach to living, especially in city centers, because there's only a finite amount of space so people can't build more."" Merchant said. While the next few years will reveal how successful a concept micro-homes will become, it's safe to say they've given many Londoners an interesting option to consider.","UK capital needs to build 49,000 new homes a year to keep up with city's rising population .
Some suggest micro-homes can offer affordable housing solution for many  in city ."
"(CNN) -- Nick D'Aloisio is tapping intently on his smartphone, his slight frame bookended by a dark mop of hair and bright blue sneakers. Curled into a VIP couch, he appears oblivious to the fuss going around him. Upstairs, a young blogger desperate for face time is stalking the corridors trying to catch him between interviews. Meetings are running over and a spare room has to be found for the overflow. The 18 year old is a phenomenon of the tech world, and a star speaker at this year's LeWeb conference in Paris. D'Aloisio created Summly, an aggregation app, from his bedroom before selling it to Yahoo for a reported $30 million in March. He initially explored the idea to help him with his studies, identifying a need to deliver concise and accurate representation of text. In a deal that made headlines around the world, Yahoo folded the app into its own, and hired D'Aloisio as a product manager. For D'Aloisio, Summly has created a concept which can be expanded into fields like multimedia, which he's now exploring at Yahoo. He's also fascinated by the popularity of what he calls ""ephemerality reacting to human interaction,"" as represented by Snapchat, the app in which content vanishes after it's been viewed. For D'Aloisio, this reflects human biology and could be a natural progression for technology. ""When we have a conversation, we forget what we say in an hour, in 24 hours, and there is this really nice retention curve, it decreases to I think 5%,"" he says. ""There are certain kinds of conversations which you don't necessarily want to be permanent, and it's an interesting concept."" As Summly crunches information, apps like Snapchat reflect the transience of human interaction -- concepts which are more intertwined than are immediately obvious, D'Aloisio says. ""When I am telling you a story, I do try and summarize it,"" he says. ""I won't tell you everything word for word, so again like a lot of these concepts are more intertwined then you think. You are taking human behavior, and interaction and distilling them down."" But while Snapchat evaporates content, others leave deep data footprints, seemingly setting up a collision of ideas. ""You have wearables on one side of the spectrum, and that's almost encouraging permanency by its very nature, this idea of archiving everything and filming everything,"" D'Aloisio says. ""Then you have almost like the antithesis, which are these very ephemeral, disappearing message services, and Snapchat, and IM and group chat...and I don't know how they are quite going to collide. They are coming from different sides of the spectrum."" D'Aloisio now spends the bulk of his time at Yahoo, although he structures his life to keep order around priorities including continued education and driving lessons. His best friends and girlfriend remain the same and as close to D'Aloisio as before he was catapulted onto the global stage. His 18th birthday last month consisted of a surprise dinner with family and friends, a low key celebration for someone who might have been tempted to reach for the finest champagne. D'Aloisio gesticulates rapidly as he articulates ideas on topics that range from linguist theory, philosophy, biology and mathematics. But he calls himself a hobbyist; someone who wants to learn. He idolizes figures like Leonardo da Vinci, whose extraordinary talents allowed him to straddle intellectual and artistic disciplines. D'Aloisio's current intellectual hero is Georg Cantor, a German mathematician who, in the late 1800s, proved infinity came in different sizes. ""I'm fascinated by this form of maths, because to me trying to understand something as complex and transcendent as infinity actually ends up solving of lot of problems to do with artificial intelligence and knowledge,"" D'Aloisio says. Then he slips into teen talk, for a second. ""These figures are just kind of cool, for me anyway, obviously not cool, in like, cool, cool, but cool as in intellectually cool.""

"Let's get ready to ... mumble. As in, what now, George Zimmerman? Seems like the former neighborhood watchman has found yet another way to remain in the public limelight. This time, he'll be stepping into a boxing ring.  Although no contract has been signed, a promoter is negotiating with rapper DMX to fight him, according to the promoter and a rep for DMX. ""DMX has promised to 'beat his ass,' but no contract or paperwork has been signed or agreed to yet,"" DMX spokesman Domenick Nati told CNN Wednesday. Zimmerman said the celebrity boxing match was his idea. Boxing was his hobby, he told Radar Online last month, even prior to the ""incident."" The incident, of course, is the February 2012 encounter in which he shot dead an unarmed Trayvon Martin, 17. He stood trial for murder but was acquitted last year. ""Prior to the incident, I was actually going to the gym for weight loss and doing boxing-type training for weight loss,"" he told Radar. ""A mutual friend put me in contact with Damon and provided me with an opportunity and motivation to get back in shape and continue with my weight loss goals and also be able to help a charity out."" Damon is Damon Feldman, owner of Celebrity Boxing and a self-described opportunist whose claim to fame is putting together bizarre matchups. Think Tonya Harding, Michael Lohan. He said last week that he was accepting offers for someone to step into the ring for a three-round, pay-per-view fight with Zimmerman. ""The news has been out for an hour and my e-mail is overloaded with 8,000 people wanting to fight George,"" Feldman told CNN on Thursday. Early Wednesday morning, he said he'd picked the contender. Out of more than 15,000 e-mailed requests, he's going with DMX. ""The match will be one of the Biggest Celebrity Boxing matches of all time,"" his news release said (uppercase emphasis his). But in order to find out where and when it will take place, we'll have to wait until next week. Feldman said Wednesday he was shooting for March 15. DMX, as we know is a rapper, and braggadocio is his calling card. He's out for blood, he told TMZ. Not only will he break every rule in boxing,  he said, he'll ""beat the living (expletive)"" out of Zimmerman. Not everyone welcomes the chance to see Zimmerman taking punches.  Rev. Al Sharpton told a Los Angeles group Wednesday that  he was concerned ""about the precedent that it sets."" ""We must be very careful not to glorify or in any way sidestep the implications of making someone whose only claim to fame was killing an unarmed young man named Trayvon Martin into a cultural celebrity or hero,"" Sharpton said. A petition has been launched on Change.org calling for the planned boxing event to be canceled.  ""This is a blatant show of disrespect and nothing positive or righteous would come from such a stunt,"" it reads. Ian Karmel, a writer for ""Chelsea Lately,"" has a better idea. ""They should send Floyd Mayweather to the ring and tell George Zimmerman it's DMX,"" he tweeted. ""He won't know the difference."" Zimmerman rips prosecutor Angela Corey in new painting .

"(CNN)Everyone knows who Chris Kyle was -- the ""American Sniper."" That may make work challenging for a small Texas county tasked with giving his accused killer, Eddie Ray Routh, a fair trial. Jury selection is set for Thursday, and an Erath County court will begin sifting through 800 hundred potential jurors, the Stephenville Empire-Tribune reported. An attorney for Routh wants the trial's venue moved, saying a fair trial is impossible there. With a population of just under 40,000 people, the defense says it might be hard to find even a handful who: . Kyle, who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history for his 160 confirmed kills in Iraq, had already risen to fame for his bestselling autobiography, ""American Sniper,"" when he died on February 2, 2013. Kyle had taken Routh and another man to a firing range. Routh, an unemployed former Marine, was one of them. He suffered from severe PTSD. Kyle was doing charitable work to help former soldiers suffering from the psychological disorder. The other man with them was Chad Littlefield, who was Kyle's friend. It was a Saturday, and the three men arrived at the Rough Creek Lodge, about 90 miles southwest of Dallas after 3 p.m. The range makes up a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre resort, and the men were isolated. ""So, there wasn't anybody anywhere close to that,"" Sheriff Tommy Bryant said back then. There were no witnesses to the killing of Kyle and Littlefield. Less than two hours after they had arrived, a hunting guide passing by found the two victims motionless, went to the lodge and called 911. Kyle and Littlefield were dead when officers arrived. Routh was gone, and so was Kyle's black Ford pickup. Law enforcement put out an all-points bulletin. Routh drove up in it at his sister's house 65 miles away, police said. She called 911. ""I'm terrified for my life,"" she said. Routh had told her that he killed two men. ""They went out to a shooting range. Like, he's all crazy,"" Routh's sister told authorities. ""My husband is going to talk to you, because I'm so nervous."" Routh got back into the truck and hit the road again, police said. But he was easy to find. Officers caught up with him that evening at his home in a Dallas suburb. While talking with police, he jumped back into the truck and sped off again, police say. They gave chase and stopped him after spiking his tires. He did not struggle when they arrested him, police said. Routh's attorney has said his client will plead not guilty by reason of insanity. Kyle learned to shoot on hunting trips with his father, then went on to serve four combat tours in Iraq with the SEALs, though his official biography notes he also worked with Army and Marine units. He received two Silver Stars and other commendations before leaving the Navy in 2009 -- claiming that, in his years as a sniper, he'd killed more than 150 people, which he called a record for an American. He said that while killing did not come easy at first, he knew it meant saving lives. ""The first time, you're not even sure you can do it,"" he said in the interview. ""But I'm not over there looking at these people as people. I'm not wondering if he has a family. I'm just trying to keep my guys safe."" Kyle's story and the movie made from it have triggered broad enthusiasm but also drawn critics and doubts about his accounts. A sniper's view: 'When you are bred to kill, you know' Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle.

"(OPRAH.com) -- Lots of folks have Sunday morning rituals -- church, pancakes, watching football. I turn to the wedding pages. Every Sunday, I open up The New York Times to check out the wedding announcements. They call that ""the sports section for women,"" which is annoying, because it presupposes that, because I'm a chick, (a) I don't like sports and (b) I love weddings. To which I say, (a) I know what a hat trick is and (b) wedding invitations are just bills written in calligraphy. No: I check out the wedding announcements because I want to see how many women change their names. I am freshly gobsmacked every single Sunday morning when I see that about half the women -- mostly under 35, all women with careers, all women who chose to submit their announcement to the putatively liberal New York Times --are electing to give up their identity. Oprah.com: What happily ever after really looks like . What would Lucy Stone say? She was a 19th-century suffragist who was the first American woman to revert to her birth name after marriage. She even had to chastise one Susan B. Anthony by writing to Suze, ""A wife should no more take her husband's name than he should hers."" Stone's followers -- women who refused to change their names upon marriage -- were called Stoners. Today only about 20 percent of American women are Stoners. In other words, 80 percent of women change their identities -- I mean, names -- upon getting married. It makes me wish we were a more progressive country like...Iran. Yes, Iran, where Muslim women keep their names for life. So must women, by law, keep their names in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Chile, Malaysia, Korea...I could go on, but I really like the way they do it in Spain. Oprah.com: What it's like to be 30 around the world . There, people have two surnames -- their father's and their mother's. When they have a child, she receives the first surname from the father and the second surname is the first surname of the mother, and the parents choose whether the father's or the mother's surname goes first, although this order must be the same for all their children. If that was a bit confusing, it's just because they use the metric system. Names are our identity. They matter. Think about it: What does the Witness Protection Program do when they want you to disappear? They make you keep your first name and change your last name. When someone illegally assumes someone else's name, we say an identity's been stolen; when someone legally assumes someone else's name, we say...you're married. Let's cut through the most platitudinous argument: ""A family shares a name."" Um, nuh-uh. Did your grandmother have the same last name as you? Was she still your Nana? Conversely, does having the same last name mean you'll always stay a family? Ask the Gibsons or the McCartneys or the McGreeveys or... What's in a name? You tell me... • Would you want to lay down seven grand to buy a wedding dress from Vera Becker? (Vera Wang?) • How about listen to a song from Mariah Cannon, Jennifer Anthony or Barbra Brolin?

"Kurdish fighters defending the key Syrian border city of Kobani are dangerously outmatched as ISIS advances, a top United Nations official said Tuesday, calling for the international community to step in. ""They have been defending themselves with great courage. But they are now very close to not being able to do so. They are fighting with normal weapons, whereas the ISIS has got tanks and mortars,"" Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said in a statement. ""The international community needs to defend them. The international community cannot sustain another city falling under ISIS."" Were Kobani to fall, ISIS would control a complete swath of land between its self-declared capital of Raqqa, Syria, and Turkey -- a stretch of more than 100 kilometers (62 miles). Outnumbered and outgunned by ISIS, local fighters trying to defend the Kurdish-dominated city have tried to flee into Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that Kobani was about to fall to ISIS as protests raged in his country over how the group should be handled. And hours after U.S. airstrikes targeting ISIS struck near Kobani overnight, the city's future was far from certain. Stopping ISIS from taking over cities, towns and other territory in Syria isn't the focus of U.S. efforts, a senior administration official and a U.S. official told CNN. At a briefing, a State Department spokeswoman faced persistent questions over whether saving the city was a U.S. priority. The answer, CNN global affairs correspondent Elise Labott said, sounded like a resounding ""no."" ""It's obviously horrific to watch what's going on the ground, but it's important for the United States, for us to also step back and remember our strategic objective as it relates to our efforts and our engagement in Syria,"" spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. The U.S. goal, she said, is ""a deliberate, well thought-out campaign in Syria"" to disrupt ISIS command and control, destroy the group's infrastructure and attack sources of fuel and financing for ISIS. ""Certainly no one wants to see Kobani fall, but our primary objective here is preventing (ISIS) from gaining a safe haven,"" she said. ""And we're going after those specific structures that I mentioned,"" Psaki added. ""But we would not have taken the range of military strikes we have taken, including overnight, if we did not want to support and -- and defend the area."" Five airstrikes targeting groups of ISIS fighters struck near Kobani overnight, U.S. Central Command said.  There were another four strikes elsewhere in Syria and four in Iraq. ""Finally, they are hitting the right places,"" one local fighter against ISIS said after the airstrikes near Kobani, which is close to  the Turkish border and key to ISIS' effort to extend its terrain. Airstrikes against the radical Islamist group in Kobani can be challenging because many targets are too close to the Turkish border or Kurdish forces to strike, a senior U.S. military official said. Violent protests in Turkey . Destroying ISIS will require ground operations, Erdogan said, according to the semi-official Anadolu news agency. Speaking to Syrian refugees, he said there has been ""no achievement yet,"" despite months of efforts against ISIS. Erdogan called for a no-fly zone, and for the arming of opposition groups in Iraq and Syria. People upset over what they consider Turkey's failure to respond adequately to the ISIS threat launched protests in Turkey, some of which turned violent. Three people were killed and at least 36 injured in demonstrations throughout Turkey, police said, according to Anadolu. At least five Turkish police officers were among the injured, Anadolu said. There were clashes overnight in Istanbul, and a group of about 50 to 60 protesters blocked a road, CNN affiliate CNN Turk reported. Some demonstrators set fire to a bus and garbage truck and smashed windows and cars. One protester was killed in the middle of a demonstration after being hit in the head by a gas canister in the town of Varto, police said. And two protesters died during demonstrations in the southeastern province of Siirt, Anadolu reported. In Belgium, meanwhile, Kurdish protesters stormed the European Parliament building.  CNN affiliate RTL Belgium said about 50 protesters stormed into the building.  Police then cordoned it off. Some European nations have joined the fight against ISIS, but the Kurdish protesters want tougher action. Belgium participated in overnight airstrikes in Iraq, U.S. Central Command said. Dutch join in, Canada to follow suit . Dutch forces participated for the first time in airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq as well, dropping three bombs on ISIS vehicles that were shooting at Kurdish Peshmerga forces, the Dutch Defense Ministry said in a statement. The vehicles were destroyed, and ISIS fighters may have been killed, the ministry said. Canada's Parliament approved an air combat mission against ISIS in Iraq, pledging up to six CF-18 fighter jets as part of a strike force, in addition to other aircraft for surveillance, reconnaissance and refueling. ""To be absolutely clear, Canada's engagement in Iraq is not a ground combat mission. It includes a number of targeted measures, being taken with allies, to severely limit the ability of ISIL to engage in full scale military movements and to operate bases in the open,"" Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement. ""We do not take this step lightly. The threat posed by ISIL is real. If left unchecked this terrorist organization will grow and grow quickly."" Near Kobani, airstrikes hit ISIS vehicles . In Syria, according to U.S. Central Command, the airstrikes against ISIS included: . -- One south of Kobani destroyed three ISIS armed vehicles and damaged another . -- One southeast of Kobani destroyed an ISIS armed vehicle carrying anti-aircraft artillery . -- Two southwest of Kobani damaged an ISIS tank . -- One south of Kobani destroyed an ISIS unit . Elsewhere in Syria, two strikes west of al-Hasakah hit multiple ISIS buildings, one near Deir Ezzor struck an ISIS staging area and IED production facility, and one southwest of Rabiyah struck a small group of ISIS fighters. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE all participated in the strikes, Central Command said. Death toll in fight for Kobani . More than 400 people have been killed in the fight for Kobani since mid-September, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The group said it has documented the deaths of 219 ISIS jihadists, 163 members of the Kurdish militia, and 20 civilians. A northern Iraqi hospital has received the bodies of at least 29 suspected ISIS militants, the head of the Tal Afar hospital said Tuesday. Danial Qassim said most were killed in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes overnight. Tal Afar is about 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of Mosul -- Iraq's second-largest city.  Mosul has also been overtaken by ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. How ISIS makes its millions . Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? U.S. military airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria have cost more than $62 million so far, according to data provided by the U.S. Defense Department. The data, apparently sent out inadvertently to the Pentagon's press contacts on Monday, listed the total number of airstrikes by U.S. Central Command in Iraq and Syria. It also detailed locations of targets and specified the costs of munitions used.","Canada will send fighter jets to target ISIS in Iraq .

"(CNN)Philippines security forces killed one of the FBI's most wanted terrorists during an otherwise disastrous mission in the south of the country last month, DNA tests indicate. Commandos in pursuit of the notorious Malaysian bomb maker Zulkifli bin Hir, also known as Marwan, took a DNA sample from the scene of their assault on their target, and passed it to the FBI for testing. Marwan -- believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah's central command -- had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by Philippine security forces in 2012. But preliminary results from the tests showed a link with a known relative of Marwan, said David Bowdich, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. While the testing could not yet provide ""absolute identification,"" he said, ""the results do support that the biological sample provided by Philippine authorities came from Marwan."" Marwan's brother, Rahmat bin Hir, is in a California prison following a 2007 arrest for conspiracy to provide ""material support to terrorists."" The FBI has been offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Marwan's capture, in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court. It accuses him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations, and having conducted bomb-making training for terror groups, including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf. ""He was the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah within the Philippines, the most senior figure,"" said Clarke Jones, a terrorism expert at Australian National University, who works on de-radicalizing Islamist terrorists in Philippine prisons. The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years, and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region. Marwan, was believed to be affiliated with the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), a hardline splinter group which rejected the peace deal, and had claimed responsibility for bombings in the region, said Jones. At large since 2003, he had been able to operate in relative safety from his base in the southern Philippines, said Jones. He said the killing of Marwan would ""without a doubt"" disrupt the BIFF's activities. ""He was a key agitator in disrupting the peace accord between MILF and the Philippines government,"" he said. ""This is a major blow to the militants down south."" The mission to get Marwan late last month went disastrously awry, with 44 members of the police's elite Special Action Force (SAF) unit killed in a 12-hour firefight after ambushing the bomb maker in the southern province of Maguindanao. Authorities said that as commandos were retreating from their assault, they came under fire from members of the BIFF. In maneuvering away from the BIFF onslaught, they strayed into territory controlled by the MILF, and further fighting ensued, shattering a three-year ceasefire. A national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest. In a eulogy, the deputy director of the Special Action Force, Police Chief Superintendent Noli G. Talino, expressed his guilt at having failed to safely extract the fallen men. ""Is it worth it? One international terrorist equivalent to 44 SAF troopers?"" he asked. ""I'm sure if you will ask them, it is worth it."" READ MORE: Dozens of Philippine police killed in raid on 'high value' bomb makers .

"(CNN)There was a time when there was nothing like David Letterman on television. Letterman was the guy who dropped bowling balls and watermelons from the roof of a tall building. Letterman was the guy who had a writer come on to read, straight-faced, from ""The Family Circus."" Letterman was the guy who let his stage manager recap ""Melrose Place,"" let two Bangladeshi gift-store owners named Mujibur Rahman and Sirajul Islam serve as ""roving correspondents"" and always -- ALWAYS -- bit the network hand that fed him. (Or, perhaps, gave the ""GE handshake"" to his corporate bosses. ) He took elements of Steve Allen, Ernie Kovacs, Johnny Carson and Mad Magazine, ran them through his own skewed perspective and came up with something new: the anti-talk show. This week 33 years ago -- February 1, 1982, to be precise -- ""Late Night with David Letterman"" made its debut. The first guest? Bill Murray. The talk show host announced in April that he was stepping down from ""Late Night's"" CBS successor, ""The Late Show with David Letterman,"" in 2015. Letterman's final show will be May 20. 'Do our own thing' If you were a celebrity who came on ""Late Night"" (his 1980s NBC show) or ""The Late Show"" (his CBS successor) simply to chat about your new movie or album or TV show, good luck to you. Dave -- he was always ""Dave"" -- might be interested, but more likely he was bored or cranky. He much preferred the Steve Martins or Bill Murrays of the world who would use their spot to do something silly. It was a comedic style that never really captured Middle America -- for most of their 20-year rivalry, Jay Leno's ratings were much higher than Letterman's -- but influenced a generation of comedians and comedy writers. ""The Simpsons,"" Ben Stiller, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, any comedian or comedy that used irony, silliness, absurdity and a little bit of antagonism as their stock in trade -- Dave made network television, previously an irony-free zone, safe for all of them. (There was more than a little Letterman in Garry Shandling's curdled, insecure faux talk-show host, Larry Sanders.) ""He did the thing that everyone's tried to do since and has never done, which is to take the talk-show form and redo it,"" Jerry Seinfeld, an early Letterman guest, told Rolling Stone in 2011.  ""The mindset was, 'We're tired of pretending there are no cue cards and no cameras and nothing's rehearsed. It's late, and we're going to take over this little piece of territory and do our own thing.' Now that mindset is everywhere."" Reveling in friction . At its best, Letterman's late-night show was unpredictable, particularly in the 1980s, when it was all new. He once used pictures from an old Sears catalog over the opening credits. He did a ""360-degree show,"" letting the camera rotate all the way around during the course of the hour. (At the half-hour mark, Letterman was upside-down.) His interviews -- the ""talk"" of talk shows -- were often deliberately devoid of content. Sometimes he used his guests for comedy bits, as when Steve Martin, allegedly on the set to promote a movie, deplored Letterman's questions and then had the Late Show Gospel Choir launch into a gospel song about himself. Other times they were, shall we say, antagonistic. Perhaps the most famous example was an appearance by actor Crispin Glover (""Back to the Future"") in 1987. At one point, Glover got up to demonstrate a roundhouse kick. Letterman went to a commercial break. When he returned, Glover was gone. Of course, Letterman reveled in friction. Both Cher and Madonna had tetchy interviews with the host. He made much of an alleged feud with Oprah Winfrey. During the ""Late Night"" days, he booked people like Brother Theodore or ""American Splendor"" cartoonist Harvey Pekar: types who were the very antithesis of talk-show guests, types who made audiences uncomfortable. Letterman grew up a bit when he went to CBS in 1993. With NBC, he wore blazers and sneakers, very much the impish college boy. Suddenly he was in nice suits and shined shoes. The guests became more of the A-list variety, though Dave was still the type to make room for a musician like Warren Zevon, a personal favorite who would never have passed muster on Leno's ""Tonight."" But it probably says something that Letterman's most striking moments of recent years came when he dropped the ironic pose and spoke from the heart. These moments -- paying tribute to mentor Johnny Carson, thanking his heart surgeons, talking about his son, confessing to an affair -- made the very private host seem a little more approachable. Given some of the stories about Letterman's self-loathing that his former partner and onetime head writer, Merrill Markoe, has told over the years, he probably hated that. Who shall be the heir? Perhaps all that irony doesn't make sense anymore. With Jimmy Fallon's takeover of the ""Tonight Show,"" commentators have been making much of a ""return to earnestness,"" playing up Fallon's niceness and wide-eyed wonder. Fallon himself has named Steve Allen as a model, not so much Letterman. (Conan O'Brien would never have said that.) And there's something a little awkward about Letterman, the King of Absurdity, still presiding over his anti-talk show circus at the age of 67. (He turns 68 in April.) It's not that he can't pull it off; it's that he's been doing it for so long that his original college student audience now has children (and grandchildren!) of their own. They have so many more options, and Dave is now one of many. Stephen Colbert, who created his own kind of looking-glass show, will take over  this year. No doubt he'll bring his own absurdity to the role. But nobody will replace Dave. That was obvious 33 years ago.","Letterman's comedic style has always been different .
His late-night shows were often unpredictable .
Stephen Colbert will replace him this year ."
"(CNN) -- Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic have often been talked about this year as being part of the next generation of players who can break up the dominance of tennis' Big Four. But judging by his display at the U.S. Open, Marin Cilic could be the most likely candidate. Cilic became only the third men's player outside Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray to win a grand slam title since early 2005 when he crushed Kei Nishikori 6-3 6-3 6-3 in under two hours in New York on Monday. Few, however, would have seen it coming -- last year the 25-year-old Croatian didn't play at the season's final major because he was serving a drug suspension. Cilic felt aggrieved when he received his nine-month ban after testing positive for a banned stimulant he said got into his system accidentally. It was later reduced to four months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled that the initial punishment handed out by the International Tennis Federation was too severe. He returned late last year with extra gusto -- and a serve made even better by his charismatic coach, countryman and idol, Goran Ivanisevic. Ivanisevic himself was one of the biggest servers in the history of the men's game. ""In this last year my team has brought something special to me, especially Goran,"" Cilic, who pocketed $3 million, told the crowd. ""We're working really hard, but most important of all the things he brought to me was enjoying tennis and always having fun. ""I think I enjoyed my best tennis over here and I played the best ever in my life. ""One of the biggest pieces of advice Goran gave me this tournament was to not think too much,"" he later told Britain's Sky Sports. ""Toss the ball, hit it, play your game, be aggressive. Try to be relaxed."" The 6-foot-6 Cilic overpowered Federer in the semifinals in straight sets and did the same against the diminutive Nishikori, firing 17 aces and winning 80% of his first-serve points. In the sixth game of the second set, Cilic hit four straight aces to hold to love. And when it wasn't his thunderous serve, it was his heavy ground strokes that pinned back his Japanese opponent. While Ivanisevic won Wimbledon in 2001 to send his nation into a frenzy, Nishikori was bidding to become the first Asian man to claim a grand slam singles title. Back at home ahead of the finale, excitement soared to unprecedented levels after Nishikori upset Djokovic in the semifinals. Replicas of his shirt were sold out, his racket was in high demand and television viewers bought subscriptions in vast numbers to watch the final against Cilic that began at 6 a.m. in Tokyo. Alas, they were disappointed. But the 24-year-old Nishikori still made history by becoming the first Asian man to play in a grand slam singles final. Remarkably, he didn't know if he would be able to compete in New York this year because he had surgery to remove a cyst from his toe a month ago and missed warmup tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati. ""He was playing really well today and I couldn't play my tennis,"" Nishikori told the crowd. ""It's a really tough loss but I'm happy to come into the final. ""It was a fun two weeks."" Monday marked the first occasion since the 2005 French Open that two players in their maiden grand slam final faced off, leading Ivanisevic to proclaim beforehand that Cilic and Nishikori would be nervous. Both began the tournament outside the top 10, though they're now in it. ""They are both climbing to Mount Everest,"" Ivanisevic told Sky Sports. ""I don't know who is going to stick the flag, (a) Japanese or Croatian."" Cilic, though, seemed relaxed from the outset. He smiled as he walked in the tunnel that led to the biggest court in tennis, during the coin toss and when he took part in the pre-match photo. It turns out he was bluffing. ""The night before I was completely relaxed,"" said Cilic. ""I was feeling that it's just another match, another day. But a couple of hours before the match the nerves started to kick in and I was a bit nervous. ""I didn't know what to expect on the court."" Cilic -- who entered the encounter with a 2-5 record against Nishikori -- nonetheless set the tone by saving a break point in the first game with a fine running forehand cross court. Whether it was nerves or the different conditions -- it was cooler and slower than when he downed Djokovic -- Nishikori often mistimed his shots in the first set. He showed his frustration at 2-4 after he struck a short ball that allowed Cilic to pounce with a forehand. Nishikori never did turn things around, finishing with 19 winners and 30 unforced errors. Cilic was broken for the only time as he attempted to close out the second set but then broke straight back to take a two-set lead. Nishikori engineered five-set magic against Raonic and Stan Wawrinka in the fourth round and quarterfinals, respectively, but there would be no stretching Cilic to five sets. Wawrinka beat Nadal to win the Australian Open in January, although the Spaniard was severely hampered by a bad back. Another break handed Cilic the lead in the third set and when he fended off three break points in the seventh game, the match was essentially over. After double faulting on a first match point -- he tried to finish matters in style with a second-serve ace -- there was no mistaking on the second match point. Cilic ripped a backhand cross-court that gave Nishikori no chance and he collapsed to the court before making his way up to his player box to celebrate. The celebrations will intensify when he returns to Croatia. ""Everybody from home was telling me it was a huge day for Croatia,"" Cilic said. ""Everybody was stuck to the TVs."" A continuation of this form and Cilic can expect to be celebrating much more in the future.","Marin Cilic defeats Kei Nishikori in New York to claim his first major .

"(CNN)Following Wednesday's tragic crash in Taipei, its Civil Aerospace Authority (CAA) has grounded all Taiwanese-registered ATR 72's for safety checks to assess whether they meet the agency's standards. The checks affect aircraft in the fleets of TransAsia, the airline at the heart of Wednesday's fatal incident, and Uni Air, another local carrier. TransAsia operates six ATR 72-500s and four ATR 72-600s including the ATR 72-600 which crashed Wednesday. Uri Air has 12 ATR 72-600s. Fred Wu, President of TransAsia Airways, told journalists that the airline was complying with the temporary halt of the company's ATR 72 fleet. ""The airline, as requested from the CAA, is specifically checking all ATR aircraft in the fleet. They have not finished checking one until this morning,"" he said. ""Once we have one finished, CAA will confirm the results before we start flying that aircraft again."" The CAA has also prohibited TransAsia from applying for new traffic rights for a year, according to Taiwan state news agency CNA. The plane, which reportedly flew three times on Wednesday, appears to have suffered a ""flameout"" -- an engine failure -- shortly after takeoff. ""It appears that it could have had a single-engine flameout, it could have had a dual-engine flameout,"" former ATR pilot Stephen Frederick told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""Those are things we're going to learn."" It is the second fatal TransAsia incident involving an ATR 72 in less than a year -- although the plane that crashed in July while attempting to land on Penghu Island, was a ATR 72-500 -- an older model. In its 20-year history, the airline has lost five aircraft, and encountered seven ""significant safety incidents,"" Greg Waldon, Asia Managing Editor of Flightglobal, an industry publication, wrote in an analysis piece. Along with Wednesday's fatal crash, TransAsia planes have been involved in four incidents involving loss of life -- two of which affected only crew, two of which also saw passengers perish. All involved ATR aircraft. The planes, which are constructed by a European consortium, have suffered crashes before. ATR 72's, as well as the company's similar, but smaller ATR 42 designation, have previously been involved in a number of incidents. No fewer than 11 incidents resulting in passenger deaths involving  ATR turboprops have been recorded around the world, including TransAsia's recent crashes. During a domestic U.S. flight from Indianapolis to Chicago, an American Eagle ATR 72-200 crashed near Roselawn, Indiana, in 1994 following icing on its wings. All four crew and 64 passengers died. An account, ""Unheeded Warning"" by Frederick, a former American Eagle ATR pilot, is credited in having a role in the subsequent Federal Aviation Administration-ordered grounding of all ATR-72 aircraft. The account alleges that the model had ""a history of performance problems in icing conditions."" However, Desmond Ross, former pilot and principal of DRA Professional Aviation Services, a consultancy for airlines and aviation authorities, says that amongst his peers, ATR planes have a good reputation. ""(The ATR 72) is actually a very good aircraft -- it's been around for a while,"" he says. ""It's used extensively in regional services, including by Virgin in Australia. Generally speaking it's a good aircraft. ""It doesn't have reputation as a difficult plane to fly. I know one guy who has flown them in Africa and Australia who thinks it's a great aircraft. I can't speak to them being dangerous."" Indeed, the ATR's cost-efficiency has made it a popular choice for airlines, particularly those in the low-cost sector, and on less-popular routes which typically ferry fewer passengers. ""The ATR is the workhorse of the Asia Pacific turboprop fleet.  It is popular among airlines for its relatively low operational costs, particularly in a high-fuel-cost environment, and the type has a dominant market share,"" Flightglobal's Waldron told CNN. However, he would not speculate whether the latest episode would affect the model's continued popularity. ""It's far too early to say exactly what happened to GE235. The flight will be the subject of a lengthy investigation that will look at factors such as cockpit communications and the aircraft's performance.""","Taiwanese Civil Aerospace Authority (CAA) has ordered all Taiwanese-registered ATR 72's grounded until safety checks can be made .

"Los Angeles (CNN)Conrad Hilton, the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton, allegedly threatened and intimidated flight attendants on a British Airways flight from London to Los Angeles last summer, using profanity, smoking in a bathroom and calling passengers ""peasants,"" federal authorities said this week. Hilton, 20, surrendered himself to the FBI on Tuesday -- charged with interfering with flight crew members -- and appeared in court later that day, said spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office. Hilton was freed on $100,000 bond and is scheduled to be arraigned on March 5. The federal charge alleges that Hilton ""knowingly assaulted and intimidated flight attendants of the aircraft and, in doing so, interfered with the performance of the duties of the flight attendants and lessened the ability of the flight attendants to perform their duties."" Hilton and his attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment. If convicted, Hilton could face up to 20 years in prison, authorities said. On the July 31, 2014, flight, a flight attendant told the FBI that Hilton appeared to be ""under the influence of drugs because of his erratic behavior while walking through the cabin,"" court papers said. Hilton left his seat five minutes after takeoff, even though the ""fasten seat belt"" sign was still on, authorities said. Another flight attendant said Hilton rose from his seat at least 20 times during the 10½-hour flight, court documents said. Read the federal complaint (Warning: profane language) When Hilton became enraged because a flight attendant was following him, he shouted several times that ""I am going to f------ kill you!"" and used other vulgarities, court papers said. Passengers became frightened and disturbed, authorities said. Hilton yelled several times, saying ""I will f------ own anyone on this flight; they are f------ peasants."" Hilton also accused the flight attendants of ""taking the peasants' side"" and then said he was angry because he had just broken up with a girlfriend, court papers said. He bragged that he was already banned by other airlines. ""Hilton frequently lamented that he wanted to smoke marijuana on the plane,"" according to an affidavit by FBI agent David Gates. Hilton also allegedly punched the bulkhead next to an attendant's head, missing his face by about 4 inches, court papers said. He also allegedly told a flight attendant that ""I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss!"" ""My father will pay this out, he has done it before. Dad paid $300,000 last time,"" Hilton allegedly told a flight attendant, according to court papers. Hilton's father is Rick Hilton -- who is a grandson of the Hilton Hotel empire's founder, Conrad Nicholson Hilton -- and is a partner in a real estate development firm in Beverly Hills, California. Rick Hilton and his wife of more than 30 years, Kathy, are parents of four children, Paris, Nicky, Barron and Conrad, making them the great-grandchildren of the hotel empire, according to Rick Hilton's webpage. At some point during the flight, the attendant saw Hilton go into a bathroom and smelled cigarette smoke coming from it, authorities said. The flight's pilot, who was second-in-command to the captain, ""noticed the smoke detector above the bathroom ceiling had been stuffed with paper towels, apparently to prevent the smoke alarm from sounding,"" court papers said. The pilot later confronted Hilton, and Hilton surrendered a used pack of cigarettes and a lighter, authorities said. Hilton returned to his seat and fell asleep. The captain authorized crew members to form a ""restraint team"" to restrain Hilton before he woke up, authorities said in court papers. The crew used a blanket and handcuffs on Hilton about 75 minutes before the plane landed, authorities said. He awoke while being restrained and began screaming obscenities, court documents said. ""As Hilton was being restrained, he told the flight attendants he was a model and that they were 'going to ruin my career,' "" the affidavit said. Later, in an interview with the FBI the same day, Hilton said he started his travels in Mykonos, Greece, had a connection in Athens, and then traveled to London, authorities said. He took a sleeping pill before boarding the flight to Los Angeles, court papers said. Hilton admitted to calling people ""peasants"" on the flight, but he ""denied having a confrontation with a flight attendant near the start of the flight but acknowledged having other issues with flight attendants,"" the affidavit said. Hilton allegedly told the FBI agent: ""I told all of them I could get all of their jobs taken away in less than thirty seconds,"" the affidavit said. When Gates, the FBI agent, read federal law to Hilton, he interrupted him and stated: ""I did intimidate. But, through defense. He came up to me with his nose,"" referring to a crew member, the affidavit said. CNN's Stella Chan contributed to this report.","Conrad Hilton, younger brother of Paris Hilton, is free on $100,000 bond .

"(CNN)The burning alive of Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh is yet another reminder that ISIS is intent on testing the utter limits of evil and depravity. But even as our eyes are drawn to the horrors being committed overseas, concern is growing in Washington that the Obama administration's strategy for defeating ISIS is falling short. Three retired senior military commanders -- with 12 stars between them -- recently came before the Senate Armed Services Committee to give their assessment of the defense and security challenges facing our country. With their uniforms put away, they were free to speak their minds. And all three lamented the confused, directionless wandering that constitutes the current national security strategy of the Obama administration. The three were especially disturbed by the conduct of military operations that have no clear objectives nor the defined means of achieving them. Gen. James Mattis, a former commander of the U.S. Central Command, for example, called for us to ""come out of our reactive crouch and take a firm strategic stance in defense of our values."" Gen. Jack Keane, former vice chief of staff of the Army, for his part referred in particular to our inadequate and disjointed efforts against ISIS saying, ""We are reduced to a very piecemeal effort."" He noted that our airstrikes against ISIS targets were supporting ""unproven"" local ground forces, which would ""certainly guarantee that we will be incrementally engaged with one radical group after another with no end in sight."" All Americans should share their concern. On the very day these commanders testified, their views ironically were validated by one of the few American successes in recent months: the reported successful defense of the Kurdish town of Kobani on the Syrian/Turkish border. The irony is that this town -- which had little or nothing to do with the vast challenge to our interests posed by either ISIS or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's murderous regime, and yet still consumed 70% of the airstrikes in our struggle against ISIS over the past months -- has been trumpeted as a key victory by the Obama administration. In reality, control of Kobani was contested by a confused array of combatants -- including a designated terrorist organization, the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, fighting on the coalition side against ISIS. Meanwhile, U.S. airstrikes are only likely to help the forces of the brutal al-Assad regime, which also is battling ISIS. This is a collapsing strategy grasping at reeds. U.S. military resources are being squandered without clear purpose or goal. We are indeed ""incrementally engaged with one radical group after another with no end in sight."" There is an obvious disjoint between the administration's joy at this modest success, and the lack of real progress against the enemy elsewhere. Despite President Barack Obama's claim in his State of the Union address or the customary boasts of Secretary of State John Kerry in London two days later, most credible reports show that ISIS is growing stronger in Syria. This is especially true in its Syrian strongholds. We have recently learned that an estimated 20,000 foreign fighters have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS, an estimated increase of 5,000 in the past three months. The numbers very well could be much larger. In the meantime, the Obama administration's plan to identify, vet, train and deploy a total of 5,000 anti-ISIS fighters -- two years from now -- has gone absolutely nowhere. And even if such forces materialize, when they do arrive on future battlefield perhaps, they may have only limited defensive roles, according to the Pentagon. With all this in mind, who could possibly see the President's response to the mortal threat posed by ISIS as anything but a flat-out denial of the truth? This is simply not how our country should be responding to such threats to our interests and security. Last year, Obama laid out the goal of defeating ISIS, but he still has not put forward a comprehensive strategy to accomplish this goal. It is paramount that he does so. Such a strategy must include the cooperation and support of moderate Muslim nations. As Keane said Sunday, ""Until we bring the countries that are involved and also those that have interest together and put together an alliance and establish a strategy, we're not going to be able to push effectively against (ISIS)."" After years of watching this sickening spiral of foreign policy failures, we desperately need improved vision, a stiffer backbone, wisdom and leadership. Another two years of America's growing impotence and irrelevance is a frightening prospect.","Dan Coats: U.S. lacks effective strategy for countering ISIS .

"(CNN)As they took their seats on a TransAsia Airways flight that crashed in Taipei on Wednesday, Lin Ming-wei and his young family were looking forward to a vacation on Kinmen, an island in the Taiwan Strait. Minutes later, Lin was fighting his way out of the plane's wreckage and searching frantically for his toddler in the shallow, murky waters of the Keelung River. He searched for three minutes before spotting his son's feet in the water. ""When he pulled him out, he had no heartbeat,"" Lin Ming-wei's brother, using his English name Chris Lin, told CNN. ""His lips were blue. There was no sign of life in him."" Lin Ming-wei didn't give up, performing CPR on his son. ""He is my only child. I absolutely have to save his life -- I can't lose him,"" the Liberty Times newspaper quoted him as saying. The 2½-year-old boy made it and was in a hospital Thursday, about to be discharged from the intensive care unit as he battles pneumonia, his uncle said. Chris Lin said that his brother, Lin Ming-wei, suffered some scratches, while his sister-in-law fractured some bones and is recovering well after surgery on her left hand. ""My brother was really grateful for the rescue teams (and) the pilot,"" said Chris Lin. ""Because of (the pilot's) heroic act, he was able to save a lot of people -- and allow our family to survive."" Chris Lin refuted earlier claims by local media that the Lin family switched seats before takeoff after a noise made his brother uneasy and it was this hunch that saved the family from death. He told CNN on Monday that his brother and family switched seats at the check-in desk and not when they were on the plane. Chris Lin said his brother told him the plane suddenly dropped after its left engine lost power. After it hit the water, Lin Ming-wei -- who was strapped to his seat and upside down -- unbuckled himself before helping free his wife, the brother said. A fire department rescue worker who was one of the first on the scene said the cabin was already chest-deep in water when he entered. ""Many passengers were tangled up in their seat belts and hung upside down,"" the Taipei Times quoted him as saying. Huang Chin-shun, 72, said he helped save four lives by unclipping safety belts. ""Shortly after taking off, I felt something was not right,"" he told CNN affiliate ETTV.  ""I thought: 'something's wrong with the engine,' because I always take this flight."" Thirteen people were saved in the initial rescue effort but progress slowed and water had completely filled the fuselage by evening, when a crane lifted it from the water. The Lins were not the only ones to have a lucky escape. As the out-of-control plane spiraled into the river on the outskirts of the island's capital, it clipped a taxi traveling along an elevated highway. The driver, 52-year-old Chou Hsi-tung, and his female passenger sustained only minor injuries from shattered fragments of windshield glass. Photographs showed a yellow Volkswagen with a flattened windshield and engine hood. After the plane hit, the taxi driver made a shocking report to dispatchers. ""I just brought a passenger up unto Huandong, and as I was getting on (the expressway), a plane flew by and hit me,"" he said, according to an audio recording of the call released by taxi company Crown Taxi. ""A remote-controlled model plane?"" the dispatcher asked. ""My car is completely wrecked,"" Chou replied, going on to explain that it wasn't a remote-controlled plane, but a manned plane. ""Huh?"" the puzzled dispatcher responded. ""Are there any casualties?"" The driver described the dire situation: ""The whole thing fell into the Keelung River. My passenger can't get out of the vehicle. My car's wrecked."" According to the Taipei Times, Chou's family didn't believe him at first when he telephoned home to say: ""I'm OK. My car got into a crash. It was hit by an airplane."" CNN's Vivian Kam and Mitra Mobasherat in Hong Kong, Shen Lu in Beijing and Greg Botelho and Catherine E. Shoichet in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Taxi driver to dispatch: ""A plane flew by and hit me""

"Every day, 22 veterans take their own lives. That's a suicide every 65 minutes. As shocking as the number is, it may actually be higher. The figure, released by the Department of Veterans Affairs in February, is based on the agency's own data and numbers reported by 21 states from 1999 through 2011. Those states represent about 40% of the U.S. population. The other states, including the two largest (California and Texas) and the fifth-largest (Illinois), did not make data available. Who wasn't counted? People like Levi Derby, who hanged himself in his grandfather's garage in Illinois on April 5, 2007. He was haunted, says his mother, Judy Casper, by an Afghan child's death. He had handed the girl a bottle of water, and when she came forward to take it, she stepped on a land mine. When Derby returned home, he locked himself in a motel room for days. Casper saw a vacant stare in her son's eyes. A while later, Derby was called up for a tour of Iraq. He didn't want to kill again. He went AWOL and finally agreed to an ""other than honorable"" discharge. Derby was not in the VA system, and Illinois did not send in data on veteran suicides to the VA. Experts have no doubt that people are being missed in the national counting of veteran suicides. Luana Ritch, the veterans and military families coordinator in Nevada, helped publish an extensive report on that state's veteran suicides. Veteran confronts rape and suicide . Part of the problem, she says, is that there is no uniform reporting system for deaths in America. It's usually up to a funeral director or a coroner to enter veteran status and suicide on a death certificate. Veteran status is a single question on the death report, and there is no verification of it from the Defense Department or the VA. ""Birth and death certificates are only as good as the information that is entered,"" Ritch says. ""There is underreporting. How much, I don't know."" Who else might not be counted? A homeless person who has no one who can vouch that he or she is a veteran, or others whose families don't want to divulge a suicide because of the stigma associated with mental illness; they may pressure a state coroner to not list the death as suicide . If a veteran intentionally crashes a car or dies of a drug overdose and leaves no note, that death may not be counted as suicide. An investigation by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper last year revealed an alarmingly high percentage of veterans who died in this manner in Texas, a state that did not send in data for the VA report. ""It's very hard to capture that information,"" says Barbara van Dahlen, a psychologist who founded Give an Hour, a nonprofit group that pairs volunteer mental-health professionals with combat veterans. Nikkolas Lookabill had been home about four months from Iraq when he was shot to death by police in Vancouver, Washington, in September 2010. The prosecutor's office said Lookabill told officers ""he wanted them to shoot him."" The case is one of many considered ""suicide by cop"" and not counted in suicide data. Carri Leigh Goodwin enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2007. She said she was raped by a fellow Marine at Camp Pendleton and eventually was forced out of the Corps with a personality disorder diagnosis. She did not tell her family that she was raped or that she had thought about suicide. She also did not tell them she was taking Zoloft, a drug prescribed for anxiety. Her father, Gary Noling, noticed that Goodwin was drinking heavily when she returned home. Five days later, she went drinking with her sister, who left her intoxicated in a parked car. The Zoloft interacted with the alcohol, and she died in the back seat of the car. Her blood alcohol content was six times the legal limit. Police charged her sister and a friend in Goodwin's death for furnishing alcohol to an underaged woman: Goodwin was 20. Noling says his daughter intended to drink herself to death. Later, Noling went through Goodwin's journals and learned about her rape and suicidal thoughts. A recent analysis by News21, an investigative multimedia program for journalism students, found that the annual suicide rate among veterans is about 30 for every 100,000 of the population, compared with the civilian rate of 14 per 100,000. The analysis of records from 48 states found that the suicide rate for veterans increased an average of 2.6% a year from 2005 to 2011 -- more than double the rate of  increase for civilian suicide. Nearly one in five suicides nationally is a veteran, even though veterans make up about 10% of the U.S. population, the News21 analysis found. The authors of the VA study, Janet Kemp and Robert Bossarte, included many cautions about the interpretation of their data, though they stand by the reliability of their findings. Bossarte said there was a consistency in the samples that allowed them to comfortably project the national figure of 22. But more than 34,000 suicides from the 21 states that reported data to the VA were discarded because the state death records failed to indicate whether the deceased was a veteran. That's 23% of the recorded suicides from those states. So the study looked at 77% of the recorded suicides in 40% of the U.S. population. The VA report itself acknowledged ""significant limitations"" of the available data and identified flaws in its report. ""The ability of death certificates to fully capture female veterans was particularly low; only 67% of true female veterans were identified. Younger or unmarried veterans and those with lower levels of education were also more likely to be missed on the death certificate."" ""We think that all suicides are underreported. There is uncertainty in the check box,"" says Steve Elkins, the state registrar in Minnesota, which has one of the best suicide data recording systems in the country. Websites become tool for stopping suicide . VA Secretary Eric Shinseki requested collaboration from all 50 states to improve timeliness and accuracy of suicide reporting, key to improving suicide prevention. At the time the VA released its last suicide report, at least 11 states had not made a decision on data collaboration. Combat stress is just one reason why veterans attempt suicide. Military sexual assaults are another. Psychologist Craig Bryan says his research is finding that military victims of violent assault or rape are six times more likely to attempt suicide than military non-victims. More than 69% of all veteran suicides were among those 50 and older. Mental-health professionals said one reason could be that these men give up on life after their children are out of the house or a longtime marriage falls apart. They are also likely to be Vietnam veterans, who returned from war to a hostile public and an unresponsive VA. Combat stress was chalked up to being crazy, and many Vietnam veterans lived with ghosts in their heads without seeking help. Even though more older veterans are committing suicide, it's difficult to predict what the toll of America's newest wars will be. A survey by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America showed that 30% of service members have considered taking their own life, and 45% said they know an Iraq or Afghanistan veteran who has attempted suicide. ""There's probably a tidal wave of suicides coming,"" says Brian Kinsella, an Iraq war veteran who started Stop Soldier Suicide, a nonprofit group that works to raise awareness of suicide. Between October 2006 and June 2013, the Veterans Crisis Line received more than 890,000 calls. That number does not include chats and texts. President Barack Obama says there is a need to ""end this epidemic of suicide among our veterans and troops."" In August 2012, he signed an executive order calling for stronger suicide prevention efforts.  A year later, he announced $107 million in new funding for better mental health treatment for veterans with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury, signature injuries of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.","The data the suicide rate is based on are incomplete .

"Somewhere in Texas, former President George W. Bush is smiling. Although some Democrats are pleased that taxes will now go up on the wealthiest Americans, the recent deal to avert the fiscal cliff entrenches, rather than dismantles, one of Bush's signature legacies -- income tax cuts. Ninety-nine percent of American households were protected from tax increases, aside from the expiration of the reduced rate for the payroll tax. In the final deal, Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to preserve most of the Bush tax cuts, including exemptions on the estate tax. When Bush started his term in 2001, many of his critics dismissed him as a lightweight, the son of a former president who won office as result of his family's political fortune and a controversial decision by the Supreme Court on the 2000 election. But what has become clear in hindsight, regardless of what one thinks of Bush and his politics, is that his administration left behind a record that has had a huge impact on American politics, a record that will not easily be dismantled by future presidents. The twin pillars of Bush's record were counterterrorism policies and tax cuts. During his first term, it became clear that Obama would not dismantle most of the homeland security apparatus put into place by his predecessor. Despite a campaign in 2008 that focused on flaws with the nation's response to 9/11, Obama has kept most of the counterterrorism program intact. Opinion: The real issue is runaway spending . In some cases, the administration continues to aggressively use tactics his supporters once decried, such as relying on renditions to detain terrorist suspects who are overseas, as The Washington Post reported this week. In other areas, the administration has expanded the war on terrorism, including the broader use of drone strikes to kill terrorists. Now come taxes and spending. With regard to the Bush tax cuts, Obama had promised to overturn a policy that he saw as regressive. Although he always said that he would protect the middle class from tax increases, Obama criticized Bush for pushing through Congress policies that bled the federal government of needed revenue and benefited the wealthy. In 2010, Obama agreed to temporarily extend all the tax cuts. Though many Democrats were furious, Obama concluded that he had little political chance to overturn them and he seemed to agree with Republicans that reversing them would hurt an economy limping along after a terrible recession. Opinion: Time to toot horn for George H.W. Bush . With the fiscal cliff deal, Obama could certainly claim more victories than in 2010. Taxes for the wealthiest Americans will go up. Congress also agreed to extend unemployment compensation and continue higher payments to Medicare providers. But beneath all the sound and fury is the fact that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, for most Americans, are now a permanent part of the legislative landscape. (In addition, middle class Americans will breathe a sigh of relief that Congress has permanently fixed the Alternative Minimum Tax, which would have hit many of them with a provision once designed to make sure that the wealthy paid their fair share.) As Michigan Republican Rep. Dave Camp remarked, ""After more than a decade of criticizing these tax cuts, Democrats are finally joining Republicans in making them permanent."" Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the new legislation will increase the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years. The tax cuts have significant consequences on all of American policy. Opinion: Christie drops bomb on GOP leaders . Most important, the fact that a Democratic president has now legitimated the moves of a Republican administration gives a bipartisan imprimatur to the legitimacy of the current tax rates. Although some Republicans signed on to raising taxes for the first time in two decades, the fact is that Democrats have agreed to tax rates which, compared to much of the 20th century, are extraordinarily low.  Public perception of a new status quo makes it harder for presidents to ever raise taxes on most Americans to satisfy the revenue needs for the federal government. At the same time, the continuation of reduced taxes keeps the federal government in a fiscal straitjacket. As a result, politicians are left to focus on finding the money to pay for existing programs or making cuts wherever possible. New innovations in federal policy that require substantial revenue are just about impossible. To be sure, there have been significant exceptions, such as the Affordable Care Act. But overall, bold policy departures that require significant amounts of general revenue are harder to come by than in the 1930s or 1960s. Republicans thus succeed with what some have called the ""starve the beast"" strategy of cutting government by taking away its resources.

"(CNN) -- Bedevilled by a series of corruption scandals, football's world governing body FIFA has come to an ""historical crossroad."" That's the verdict of FIFA vice president Jeffrey Webb, ahead of a meeting of the governing body's executive committee in Marrakech next week. Theo Zwanziger, the former head of the German Football Association, wants a key report into alleged corruption into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups made available to the public with names redacted. Webb, who is also president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, says FIFA has a ""responsibility"" to ensure reform is carried out. ""As a self-regulated body, the world of football finds itself at a historical crossroad,"" Webb told CNN. ""Following the CONCACAF independent investigative report, made public in April of 2013, the mandate of openness and transparency became a reality. ""The regulations that govern the FIFA Code of Ethics should be aligned with the premise of safeguarding its current reform process. ""I support the publishing of the Garcia Report, appropriately redacting to respect prior witness confidentiality agreements,"" added Webb, referring to Michael Garcia, the American lawyer who investigated the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process for FIFA. ""We have a responsibility and an opportunity to manifest the promise of reform."" Webb is not the only senior football figure to call for the report to be published with names redacted. Michel Platini, the head of European football, has also called for such measures as has Sunil Gulati, president of U.S Soccer. According to FIFA's agenda for next week's meeting, Zwanziger's proposal will be discussed as point 13.1.3. The German wants his colleagues to agree to a change of the ethics code which currently prohibits the publication via Article 36. German press agency DPA quoted Zwanziger as saying: ""I would like to see this ban relaxed so that the FIFA executive committee, as well as the public, in an appropriate form, can be informed of the contents of the investigation."" A FIFA spokesman told CNN that the matter would most likely be carried out by a vote but would depend on the proposal made by Zwanziger. Last month, FIFA judge Hans-Joachim Eckert released a 42-page summary in which he cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing in their winning bids to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups respectively. But within hours of the announcement, Garcia made known his displeasure with the findings by labeling them both ""incomplete and erroneous."" With both men unable to decide how much information should be made public, the matter has been passed onto Domenico Scala, the independent chairman of FIFA's audit and compliance committee. According to the FIFA agenda for next week's meeting, he will address members on how much of the 430-page report should be made public. Earlier this year, Marco Villiger, FIFA's legal director, told reporters that it would be difficult to sustain witness confidentiality if the report was published. ""The code of ethics is based on certain principles, one of which is confidentiality,"" said Villiger. ""Cooperation between witnesses and the ethics committee is based on confidentiality -- if not perhaps certain witnesses, whistle-blowers or other parties might not cooperate to such an extent."" However, two whistle-blowers were subsequently identified following the publication of Eckert's summary. Since Eckert's findings were made public, FIFA has faced a barrage of criticism over the way the entire episode has been handled. Reinhard Rauball, president of the German football league, warned that UEFA's 54 member nations could leave FIFA if the report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 was not published in full. His remarks came just before the Dutch Football Association demanded FIFA hand over a copy of the report, while Greg Dyke, chairman of the English Football Association warned that ""urgent action"" must be taken to restore confidence in the world governing body.","FIFA vice-president says world football at crossroads .

"""Crowd control"" took on a whole new meaning Wednesday night as a room full of partygoers were given power over a cocktail-making robot controlled by their smartphones. Attendees at a party for the Google I/O Conference here were invited to send a drink recipe via a smartphone app to the Makr Shakr, a three-armed robot designed especially for the show. They could then interact with attendees of similar taste to collaboratively design their perfect drink via social media. MIT's Senseable City Lab wanted to see what would happen when you let a mass of people take control of an industrial manufacturing machine. The idea, according to project leader Yaniv Turgeman, is to demonstrate how digital technology has the potential to take the power of factory robots away from big companies and into the hands of the people. Turgeman said the team had the idea in January and hurriedly set about getting the arms -- based on the classic factory production-line robot -- programmed to gracefully slice a lemon, shake a cocktail shaker, pour liquids carefully and so on. The team purposefully chose the look of the iconic orange industrial robot arm to make the point that big manufacturing technology was now becoming accessible to everyone. ""It's a metaphor,"" he said. ""This is the third industrial revolution. People now have the power to control very powerful technology."" At the party, every time someone created a drink the recipe would go up on a big screen behind the bar and the crowd could see it and add their own changes to the recipe -- and try the drink. ""The point is to learn from one another, to design together,"" he said. Turgeman said there was an emerging market for people who want to make things, a movement back to craft culture that takes advantage of modern technology -- sometimes referred to as the maker movement (hence the name of the robot). The movement espouses the DIY inventor or developer and promotes the sharing of free technology. He said MIT's example of easy-access digital manufacturing could transform clothes making, furniture design -- whatever people wanted. Uses could range from manufacturers engaging focus groups in a much more hands-on way at an early stage of product development to mass customization or individual use of the machines. Jon Collins, research director at UK consultancy Inter Orbis, which specializes in the impact technology is having on society and business, said this was a model that was already working very well in web development. ""Design should take hours not weeks, with a maximum of customer interaction. It's not hard to imagine how that could be extended to creation of, in this case drinks, but also other objects, once 3-D printing is in the mix,"" he said. ""There's no reason at all why small-run manufacturing should not become a socially driven activity. Meanwhile it is very interesting to think how the Internet of Things - that is, devices and objects with built-in connectivity - can link to our ability to use applications and exchange information socially."" Turgeman added: ""Before, to design, you generally had to be a designer or spend your whole life learning to be a master carver. This shifts things. The accessibility brings you back to a basic need to create. You can design, make and enjoy.""","MIT allows partygoers to control robot bartender using their cellphones .

"A Cleveland police officer shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice about two seconds after the officer and a partner pulled up in a car to investigate reports that someone was brandishing a gun at a park, surveillance video that police released Wednesday shows. Tamir, who had what police said is an air gun that looked like a real firearm, died Sunday, a day after he was shot outside a recreation center. Police also released two audio recordings Wednesday -- a 911 call preceding the shooting and a tape of a dispatcher asking officers to go to the park. The shooting happened after a person called 911 to report that a black male -- ""probably a juvenile"" -- was pointing ""a pistol"" at people outside the recreation center. Twice the caller said the gun might be fake. The dispatcher radioed to officers about a black male who was ""pointing a gun at people,"" but did not mention that caller's belief that he could be a minor and that the gun might not be a real firearm, one of the released recordings shows. Police previously said it wasn't clear if the responding officers received the information about the suspect's age or the gun possibly being fake. Authorities are investigating the shooting, and the two officers -- identified Wednesday by police as Timothy Loehmann, 26, and Frank Garmback, 46 -- are on leave from their jobs. Loehmann joined the department in March, Tomba said. Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba stressed that his department released the video at the request of Tamir's relatives, who had seen it privately with authorities' permission. ""We are honoring the wishes of the family,"" Tomba said. "" ... This is an obvious tragic event."" In a written statement obtained by CNN affiliate WEWS, the family thanked the police for making the video public. ""It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us,"" the family said. ""We ask for the community to remain calm. Please protest peacefully and responsibly. Your prayers, kind words and condolences have meant so much to us. Video shows officer shoot Tamir . The video shows Tamir walking along a sidewalk and eventually sitting on a picnic table bench under a gazebo Saturday afternoon, sometimes pointing what appears to be a handgun. Eventually, Tamir emerges from the bench and walks to the edge of the gazebo. A police car drives up to the gazebo, leaving the road and rolling over snowy grass to do so. One of the officers -- the one in the passenger seat -- told Tamir three times to ""show your hands,"" Tomba told reporters. ""(The officer's) door was open as they pulled up,"" Tomba said. ""He yelled three times as they pulled up."" The eight-minute surveillance video has no audio. Police have said Tamir reached into his waistband and pulled out the weapon. The video shows Loehmann, the passenger-side officer, exiting the car, and Tamir falls down, apparently shot. Between 1.5 to two seconds elapsed from the time the car pulled up to the moment Tamir was shot, Tomba said. At that point, only the passenger-side officer was out of the car, the video shows. One of the officers, radioing to dispatch, reported that a ""black male, maybe 20,"" was down, according to the released radio traffic between the officers and dispatchers. The driver was Garmback, a six-year veteran of the force, according to Tomba. Chief Calvin Williams said that four minutes after Tamir was shot a detective and FBI agent were on the scene. The FBI agent began first aid and paramedics arrived three minutes later. Investigators determined that Tamir's weapon was an air gun, and that an orange tip that is meant to indicate that it's not a real firearm had been removed, police said.","Police: Boy, 12, had pointed weapon in Cleveland park, but it turned out to be air gun .

"(CNN)Charlie Hebdo, the French magazine targeted by gunmen who killed journalists and police in a brazen lunchtime attack Wednesday, is no stranger to controversy. The Paris-based weekly satirical publication, which was founded in 1970, became famous for its risqué cartoons and daring takedowns of politicians, public figures and religious symbols of all faiths. And although the motive behind Wednesday's massacre is not yet clear, Charlie Hebdo's notorious cartoons satirizing the Prophet Mohammed in recent years have angered some Muslims and made it a target for attacks. ""Everybody knows them when you work in journalism,"" said Marie Turcan, a journalist who was just 200 meters from Charlie Hebdo's central Paris office when the shooting began. ""They have marked French journalism forever with their drawings and their cover stories."" A reputation for controversy . In November 2011 Charlie Hebdo's office was burned down on the same day the magazine was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at Islamic law. The cover cartoon depicted a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of the Prophet Mohammed with a bubble saying, ""100 lashes if you're not dying of laughter."" In September 2012, despite the ongoing global furor over the anti-Islam film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" the magazine published an issue featuring a cartoon that appeared to depict a naked Mohammed, along with a cover that appeared to depict Mohammed being pushed in a wheelchair by an Orthodox Jew. French and American officials expressed dismay with the decision, and France closed embassies and schools in about 20 countries temporarily as a precaution. Charlie Hebdo journalist Laurent Leger defended the magazine at the time, saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence. ""The aim is to laugh,"" Leger told BFM-TV in 2012. ""We want to laugh at the extremists -- every extremist. They can be Muslim, Jewish, Catholic. Everyone can be religious, but extremist thoughts and acts we cannot accept."" ""In France, we always have the right to write and draw. And if some people are not happy with this, they can sue us and we can defend ourselves. That's democracy,"" Leger said. ""You don't throw bombs, you discuss, you debate. But you don't act violently. We have to stand and resist pressure from extremism."" Massacre at editorial meeting . Charlie Hebdo's last tweet before Wednesday's attack featured a cartoon of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seemingly sending out his wishes for the new year with the words ""And, above all, health."" Police surveillance had reportedly been fairly tight around the magazine's office until recently, and there had been 24-hour surveillance of the premises before that, according to CNN's Jim Bittermann in Paris. Bittermann said the staff of Charlie Hebdo, which publishes weekly on Wednesday, were in their lunchtime editorial meeting when the gunmen stormed the building. Among the dead are editor Stephane ""Charb"" Charbonnier along with Georges Wolinski, Jean ""Cabu"" Cabut and Bernard Verlhac, known as ""Tignous"" -- some of France's ""most talented cartoonists,"" according to French journalist Agnes C. Poirier. Christopher Dickey, the Paris-based foreign editor of The Daily Beast, said Charlie Hebdo is a small publication that packs a big punch. ""It doesn't have a huge readership, but it has always had a very controversial approach to the news,"" Dickey told CNN. ""To see it silenced this way, especially after it survived a firebombing of its headquarters three years ago, is really reprehensible."" Thousands of people took to social media in the attack's aftermath to express solidarity with Charlie Hebdo, posting images with the words ""Je Suis Charlie"" in white on a black background, or paying tributes to the magazine on Twitter using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag. Some considered cartoons blasphemous . Any depiction of Islam's prophet is considered blasphemy by many Muslims. France has the largest Muslim population in Western Europe, with an estimated 4.7 million followers of the faith. France, which is known for its stark separation of church and state, angered some Muslims in 2011 when it banned full-face Islamic veils like the burqa, claiming they were degrading and a security risk. Charlie Hebdo is far from the only publication whose depiction of Mohammed sparked controversy. Newspapers in Norway and Denmark prompted furious demonstrations around the world in 2005 when they ran Mohammed cartoons. Several cartoonists were attacked in the fallout of that controversy. Sweden's Lars Vilks got death threats after drawing Mohammed with the body of a dog. And a man tried to break into  Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard's house after he portrayed Mohammed wearing a turban shaped like a bomb. Hollande reacts . On Wednesday, French President Francois Hollande reacted to the news: ""France is today facing a shock, the shock a of a terror attack, because this is a terrorist attack without a doubt, against  a publication that was threatened several times and that was protected."" ""In these moments we have to form a block to show we are a united country. We know how to react appropriately, with firmness, but always with the concern for national unity.""","Gunmen storm satirical magazine's office in Paris, officials say .

"King Abdullah has ordered that ""all necessary measures"" be taken to protect Saudi Arabia against terror threats, the state-run SPA news agency reported Thursday. ""Anticipating (that) the terrorist organizations or others might carry out actions that might disturb the security of the homeland, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques has ordered taking all necessary measures to protect the gains of the homeland and its territories in addition to the security and stability of the Saudi people,"" SPA said. The news agency referenced the crisis in Iraq, where militants with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are seeking to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses portions of Iraq and Syria. According to a Saudi official not authorized to talk to the media, security forces are on highest alert. ""Saudi Arabia shares a long border with Iraq and the government is aware that ISIS is very close to Iraq's border with Jordan, and is also aware ISIS has been very public about its intention to attempt to attack Saudi Arabia,"" the official said. The official said, however, that Iraq is not the government's only concern. Authorities are also concerned about intelligence showing ISIS militants starting to work with fighters from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the official said. In the past week, members of AQAP tried to sneak into Saudi Arabia from Yemen, and were caught, said the official, who did not provide details. ""While Saudi security forces are at the ready and very strong, the threat emanating from Yemen is still very real,"" said the official.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- During the past two weeks, millions of Brazilians have taken to the streets to protest years of dissatisfaction and discontent with their government. What started as a student mobilization transformed day by day to incorporate professionals, the middle class, and residents of the favelas, or slums. All are joined in protest against the administration of President Dilma Rousseff, though their motivations may differ. Some 6% of Brazilians live in the favelas, according to the 2010 census. These mountains of bricks, rising in intricate forms, border the country's largest cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Hospitals, schools, security and an end to police abuse are the principle demands from this social sector. Fatima Souza, resident of Paraisopolis, the second-largest favela in Sao Paulo, has worked as a maid for 15 years. She decries that there are no public hospitals or more schools inside the favela. Her 15-year-old son dropped out of school two years ago and his return to the classroom has been denied because of lack of room. Paraisopolis is home to 100,000 people. The community has the worst schools of the state and local education system -- lagging in primary education, behind in literacy and lacking control over the adolescents, according to an index of development in primary education. The children in the favelas can attend the public daycare centers until they are 4 years old. The elementary schools run only half a day, a schedule that causes problems for parents who work eight-hour shifts. 'We don't have hospitals' ""The only ones who do something for us are the businesses,"" Souza said. ""We don't have hospitals. The only place where we can take our children is the Einstein, a community program that is privately financed. When I ask for a visit, they give me an appointment in three months or more."" The closest available public hospitals, she says, lack equipment. ""Many say the fight is over public transportation, but why does no one hit the streets so that they raise the minimum wage,"" said Fernanda Rodrigues, a janitor who spends $30 a week for transportation to her job. Rodrigues and her 5-year-old son are beneficiaries of Bolsa Familia, a welfare program instituted in 2003 that helps more than 13 million families living in poverty. This week, the residents of Rocinha, one of the largest favelas in Rio de Janeiro, joined the anti-government protests. The immediate motivation was police abuses and security problems in the community. Just hours before the protests, a battalion of special forces had entered the favela, causing nine deaths and nine injuries. Schools closed and 7,000 children were left without classes, according to the non-governmental organization Favelas Observatory. The new middle class . One of the government's accomplishments is that some 50% of the Brazilian population has entered the middle class. Of this figure, 40 million were added to the middle class between 2004 and 2010, under the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. But rising income has not kept people from joining the protests. According to a survey by the Brazilian Institute of Opinion and Statistics, 79% of the protesters earn more than twice the minimum wage, and 76% are employed. Close to 40% of the protesters had not been born during similar massive protests in 1992. In those protests, university students mobilized to demand that then-President Fernando Collor de Mello step down. They remained in the streets until the president resigned amid corruption charges. CNN MONEY: Rising middle class fuels Brazil's protests . 'Together for a cause' ""I think these are the first protests from a public that spent years doing nothing,"" said Ricardo Almeida, a 21-year-old student. ""Before, we saw some smaller protests, but this is the first time we all joined together for a cause."" The movement sprang up in response to an increase in public transportation fares, but it has turned into a broader war cry, with protesters holding signs decrying corruption, poor public services and lack of investment in education and health. ""I decided to come because I can't stand the corruption in Brazil. Here there is no money for hospitals and schools, but yes for stadiums,"" said Adriana da Silva, who marched for the first time last week, during the largest of the demonstrations. The arrival of the World Cup . Criticism against the spending to organize the 2014 World Cup has spread across the country. A year from the event, half of the stadiums are not ready and it has become clear the need for new infrastructure was underestimated. ""When Brazil was selected as the host of the World Cup five years ago, we celebrated. We celebrated because we didn't know that it was going to cost so much,"" said Mateos da Costa, a 53-year-old taxi driver. ""Our leaders should have known that Brazil was not in a condition to organize the event."" Understanding the current social unrest in Brazil becomes a harder task every day. However, if there is something that has unified the middle class and the favelas, in addition to general discontent, it is disapproval of the president. Even though their demands may not be the same, the dissatisfaction seems to reach the same levels.

"In the neon canyons of Hong Kong's Tsim Tsa Tsui -- Hong Kong's main urban shopping precinct -- the proliferation of one type of shop has cropped up along its bustling streets in recent years. Slotted in between the malls and luxury brand boutiques, the shops open onto the street and are bathed in a harsh fluorescent light. Inside, they sell a limited and identical range of dried goods, off-the-shelf pharmaceuticals, dried baby formula -- and very little else. ""Most of our customers are mainland Chinese,"" said one shop employee, who requested anonymity, as he frantically tapped data into the shop's computer. ""I don't know how many we get through here a day -- a lot."" For some local Hong Kongers, the shops represent an assault on the amenity of the city and highlight an economy geared increasingly to the needs of cashed-up Chinese day-trippers, rather than local people. ""The truth is that most mainlanders who come are not real tourists,"" columnist and TV show host Michael Chugani wrote recently in an opinion piece for the South China Morning Post. ""They are grocery shoppers. Hong Kongers have to compete with them not only for daily necessities but also for space on the MTR (mass transit system), in restaurants and shopping malls."" Increasing visitor numbers . For Hong Kong locals this is not about to change any time soon. Hong Kong's Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Greg So Kam-leung predicted visitor numbers to Hong Kong would jump from last year's 54.5 million to 70 million in three years, the bulk of whom will be mainlanders. The figure, he said, is likely to climb to 100 million by 2023. Last month, about 100 radical Hong Kongers descended on Tsim Tsa Tsui to protest against the growing phenomenon, waving placards describing mainland shoppers as ""locusts,"" hurling abuse at Chinese tourists and scuffling with police. Demonstrators staged a follow-up protest at the nearby Mongkok shopping precinct in Kowloon the following weekend, wheeling suitcases (viewed as a ubiquitous accessory for mainland Chinese shoppers), causing congestion outside shops by faking ""shopping fatigue"" and yelling ""I have come to buy baby milk powder"" in fractured Mandarin at visitors. Protest backlash . The protests, however, also sparked a strong backlash. A group calling itself The Voice of Loving Hong Kong organized counter-protests in Mongkok and the Hong Kong government has even looked at amending its race hate laws to protect mainland visitors. ""The government understands that growth in the number of tourists has a certain level of impact on the lives of Hong Kongers. But tourism has contributed a lot in creating job opportunities. It makes up 4.5% of our economy,"" So Kam-leung said. Nevertheless, some Hong Kongers have expressed alarm at the strain on its resources from the influx of mainland Chinese. Even Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs this week acknowledged the extent of the problem, telling a closed meeting of of Hong Kong delegates at the annual National People's Congress in Beijing that the problem ""had been taken note of."" Laws introduced last March limit the purchase of infant milk formula to just two tins for travelers leaving Hong Kong. A series of mainland food scandals -- most notably in 2008 when milk formula adulterated with melamine caused infant deaths across China -- has sparked an ongoing run on Hong Kong's top brands. 'Zero-birth quota' The Hong Kong government lin 2012 also introduced a ""zero-birth quota"" policy to curb the number of pregnant mainland women having emergency deliveries in Hong Kong in order to gain Hong Kong residency and other benefits for their children. In 2011, a record 43,982 mainland mothers gave birth in Hong Kong, according to local health officials, placing a massive strain on the city's hospitals. ""Protests mocking mainland visitors as locusts and protesters mimicking mainlanders by wheeling suitcases in shopping malls are over the top,"" Chugani told CNN. ""But although these protests are small, they reflect the genuine feelings of many Hong Kong people who don't join because they don't want to be seen as anti-mainlanders. ""I speak fluent Cantonese and most people I talk to say they feel overwhelmed. So while the mocking protests are not justified, they do send a message shared by most Hong Kong people."" Rising costs . In many cases, it is the growing economic strength of mainland China that has raised tensions. Hong Kongers fear that rising commercial rents and an almost unbroken bull run on residential property prices, fueled in part by mainland Chinese demand, has priced them out of their own city. Hong Kong property agent Barry Ma, convener of a loose grouping that opposes increased mainland influence in Hong Kong, told CNN at a small rally at Sha Tin in Hong Kong's New Territories that they wanted to strengthen the ""one-country, two-systems"" policy that underpins the relationship between Hong Kong and Beijing. ""Hong Kong is an open society and we welcome everyone,"" Ma said. ""The problem is not just housing or education or our hospital and medical system -- it is our whole environment; it is just so crowded now. ""Tai Po where I work is the last district in Hong Kong before the mainland and we just receive so many people coming down from Shenzhen,"" he said. ""Even people who don't care about politics are starting to complain -- they are starting to hate mainland people. ""Catching a train used to take just five minutes but now you need an hour to organize it; there are just so many people."" For those mainland shoppers fortunate enough not to run into the small groups of placard wavers last week, however, Hong Kong offered its usual mix of bargains and brashness. A Shantou resident from east Guangdong in mainland China, who gave his name only as Xie, said he'd encountered no hostility on a day trip to Hong Kong. ""Hong Kong people have treated us pretty well and the relations between Hong Kongers and mainlanders are fine,"" he told CNN.","Hong Kong protests target shopping hordes from mainland China .

"Washington (CNN)It's the new GOP civil war. Republican presidential hopefuls -- all too aware of the party's disconnect with the middle class -- are in a fierce competition among each other to prove they're the candidate who can give voice to the struggles of Americans left behind by the uneven economic recovery. The potential 2016 candidates are working to prove that Democrats aren't the only ones sensitive to the nation's growing economic inequality. The GOP is also trying to move past serious stumbles -- such as Mitt Romney's infamous 47% comment -- that created an impression among some middle class voters that the party is out of touch. The effort was on full display Wednesday when Jeb Bush went to Detroit, one of America's most economically distressed cities, to bemoan the challenges faced by the middle class. ""The recovery has been everywhere but in the family paychecks,"" Bush said. ""The opportunity gap is the defining issue of our time."" Bush has plenty of competition from fellow Republicans seizing on the economy as they eye the White House. Marco Rubio has devoted a book to the issue. Ted Cruz recently sounded more like a Democratic populist than a GOP firebrand when he lamented the share of income earned by the top 1%. Scott Walker often stresses his humble origins while Rand Paul boasts of shopping at Walmart. Of course, there are plenty of political upsides to the GOP refining its economic messaging. The appeal to the middle class could blunt similar Democratic talking points and create a contrast to criticisms of Hillary Clinton's more refined lifestyle. David Winston, the pollster who helped coin the ""where are the jobs"" mantra for House Republicans in 2010, says the GOP message in 2016 should be just as simple: ""Where is the middle class?"" But the strategy could be tough to pull off when headline economic numbers are improving. The unemployment rate is 5.6% -- a level not seen since the precrisis summer of 2008 -- and consumer confidence has bounced back. ""The economy finally feels to be in what we call a self sustaining economic expansion,"" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC. ""We've reached this inflection point."" That will force the GOP to articulate a more nuanced critique of the economy during the Obama years. There is plenty of data to help them. Median net worth of upper-income families was around $640,000 in 2013, close to seven times the $96,500 figure for middle-income families. This was the highest gap in 30 years, according to the Pew Research Center's analysis of Federal Reserve data released in December. Potential Republican candidates are honing in on prevailing weak spots in the economy, including stubbornly low wages that are not catching up with the rising cost of living and weak labor force participation. They say it's too soon for Obama and Democrats to trumpet the recovery. ""We are creating a lot more jobs now, but we're not generating any income; we're not attracting people back into the labor force,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and economic adviser to John McCain in 2008. ""That's short of complete victory."" Still, the GOP focus on the economy could backfire if the party looks like it's nitpicking in a search of problems or overlooking legitimate improvements. Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, predicted that the unemployment rate would be below 5% by the end of this year and approach 4% in 2016. That would significantly undercut a key GOP talking point that Obama hasn't created jobs.""I'm not sure how powerful those arguments will be,"" LaVorgna said. ""It's much easier to make those arguments when the unemployment's up at 8% as it was for much of 2012.""That's what Democrats are banking on. ""It takes away a lot of the talking points of the Republicans -- that the sky is falling ... economically,"" said Bill Daley, Obama's former chief of staff. ""And (Democrats) are not on the defensive as much as they would have been a year, a year-and-a-half, two years ago."" GOP candidates will have to prove they are doing more than stealing Democratic messaging. And then there is the long term. Despite intense debate, neither party has come up with answers to generational economic questions, which go far deeper than the 2008 recession. The United States, like many other developed nations, is locked in a period of structural economic change. Millions of manufacturing and clerical jobs have been outsourced. Technology has made some trades obsolete. And jobs that are being created often pay less and carry fewer benefits than those of the past. But Republicans see an opportunity. There are signs of trouble for Democrats among blue collar workers that the GOP could jump on to improve its hopes of winning swing states. In 2008, for example, 58% of white, noncollege graduates voted Republican and 40% went Democratic. In November's midterm elections, 64% of the same demographic voted GOP and 34% chose Democrats. Improving its standing among those who are slightly better off could also help the GOP in battlegrounds such as Virginia, Florida and Colorado. And some Republicans believe a more inclusive economic argument could help repair ties with the Hispanic community. Progressive commentators say they are glad Republicans are talking about income inequality but doubt their sincerity. David Madland of the Center for American Progress said the GOP might not be denigrating those struggling in today's economy, but their policies still are a case of ""slapping lipstick on a pig."" ""There is a radical shift,"" he said. ""To acknowledge a problem is a huge first step. (But) the real opportunity lies with the public in making demands that will force the politicians to listen."" Other analysts argue that while Republicans are talking about helping the middle class, they are blocking attempts by the President to pass laws that would do just that -- for instance, on raising the minimum wage, creating jobs through infrastructure investment and hiking taxes on the rich to pay for middle class tax breaks. ""One thing that you have to watch for is people just tacking the words poverty and inequality onto a pre-existing agenda that has very little to do with addressing those problems,"" said Jared Bernstein, a former top chief economics adviser to Vice President Joe Biden. ""For the most part, I hear lots of the same trickle-down economics that helped to get us into this mess in the first place.""","Republicans knew after 2012 they had a problem with the middle class .
Presidential hopefuls are vying to talk about opportunity gap and poverty .
Democrats see a change of rhetoric, not change of policy ."
"(CNN)[Breaking news update, posted at 11:50 p.m. ET] . A Western Intelligence source tells CNN that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to 20 sleeper cells of between 120 to 180 people ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The source said that European Union and Middle East intelligence agencies identified an ""imminent threat"" to Belgium, possibly also to the Netherlands. [Previous story, posted at 8 p.m. ET] . Belgian operation thwarted 'major terrorist attacks' (CNN) -- A terror cell on the brink of carrying out an attack was the target of a raid Thursday that left two suspects dead, Belgian authorities said. A third suspect was injured and taken into custody in the operation at a building in the eastern city of Verviers, prosecutor's spokesman Thierry Werts told reporters. A senior Belgian counterterrorism official told CNN that the alleged terror cell is believed to have received instructions from ISIS. Some members of the cell had traveled to Syria and met with ISIS, which plotted the attacks as retaliation for U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria and Iraq, the Belgian source said. ""This was in the framework of an operation looking into an operational cell made up of people, some of whom coming back from Syria,"" Werts said. ""The investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in Belgium imminently."" The operation, which authorities said was ongoing, added fresh fuel to a fear that's been simmering for months as thousands of Europeans went off to join ISIS fighters in Syria. Would they bring the war back with them when they returned home? Frédéric Hausman was inside his house in Verviers when he heard the explosions start. From the window, he saw police officers firing assault rifles at a house nearby. He watched smoke rising after another explosion went off. Then, police entered the house, Hausman told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" And even though he couldn't see exactly what happened next, he heard it. ""I can hear it. Everybody can hear it,"" Hausman said. ""In this little city, everybody heard the sound."" Shouts, gunfire and the sound of glass shattering echo in a video Hausman posted on YouTube. ""The suspects immediately, and for long minutes, fired using weapons and hand weapons before being neutralized,"" Werts said. Verviers is about 69 miles (111 kilometers) east-southeast of Brussels and 200 miles (322 kilometers) northeast of Paris, where terrorist attacks last week heightened alerts in Europe. CNN affiliate VTM reported that the terrorism investigation in Belgium started weeks ago, and there has been no connection established with the Paris attacks. A Western intelligence source said the Paris attacks played a role in accelerating the timing of the Belgian operation. One reason: The arrest of a Belgian arms dealer suspected of providing weapons to Amedy Coulibaly,  the man who attacked a Paris kosher supermarket and also pledged allegiance to ISIS. Belgian investigators questioned him and searched his possessions, the source said. Through the arms dealer, the investigators got a number of ""positive hits"" on suspected extremists already known to authorities. But in the wake of the Paris attacks, the source said, it stepped up the urgency. The trio targeted in the Verviers raid had been under surveillance for some time, Werts said. Additional anti-terrorism operations are underway in other cities, the Belgian counterterrorism official said. In recent weeks, European security services received indications of an ominous possibility: that ISIS may have started directing European extremists in Syria and Iraq to launch terrorist attacks back in their home countries, the Belgian counterterrorism official said. Security agencies in several European countries were intensely investigating several groups of returnees from Syria and Iraq, the official said, including the group that authorities confronted in Belgium. The Belgian counterterrorism official said indications of ISIS ordering attacks in Europe mark an apparent significant shift by the terrorist group. Before the air campaign against it, the official said, there was little indication ISIS leaders were directly plotting attacks in the West. Instead, the group prioritized its project to create an Islamic caliphate. The official named France, the UK and Belgium as countries facing a particular threat. Counterterrorism agencies in Germany also are on high alert because of the number of fighters who have traveled. Several European countries, including Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands are participating in the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq. Why would ISIS change tack? Partly because of increased competition between ISIS and al Qaeda affiliates, including the Khorasan group in Syria, to be seen as the standard bearers of global jihad, according to the official. The official said there is also significant concern about Khorasan attack plotting against Europe. U.S. officials previously told CNN that French al Qaeda operative and bomb-maker David Drugeon was suspected to be talent-spotting European jihadis in Syria for operations in Europe. Drugeon was injured in a drone strike in November but is believed to be still alive. Last week, Andrew Parker, the head of Britain's security service MI5, warned, ""A group of core al Qaeda terrorists in Syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the West,"" an apparent reference to the Khorasan group. European officials have been warning for months about the unprecedented challenge posed by returning fighters. More than 3,000 Europeans have left to fight in Syria in recent years. The total number who have returned to Europe is estimated to be over 500, including 250 who have returned to the UK, almost 200 to France and about 70 to Belgium. Several returning ISIS fighters have already been implicated in attack plans in Europe. In February, police in Cannes broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in France by Ibrahim Boudina, a French-Algerian extremist who allegedly had just returned from fighting with ISIS in Syria. Police said they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive TATP inside soda cans in his family's Cannes apartment building. Screws and nails were attached to one with sticky tape as shrapnel, according to sources briefed on the investigation. Boudina has denied the allegations against him. Mehdi Nemmouche, a French-Algerian ISIS fighter who allegedly helped guard Western hostages in Syria before returning to Europe, allegedly shot and killed four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels in May. Nemmouche was arrested in France and extradited to face trial in Belgium. He has denied the charges. In both the Cannes and Brussels plots, investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own steam. No evidence has been publicly released suggesting ISIS leadership signed off on the plots. But the worry now is that ISIS has pivoted toward launching attacks in Europe. European officials say all this adds up to an unprecedented terrorist threat in Europe. Late last year, just weeks before the attacks on a satirical magazine, Jewish grocery and police officers in Paris, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said France had never faced a greater terrorist threat. ISIS runs large training facilities in Syria, has deep financial pockets, and access to thousands of potential European recruits. CNN's Deborah Feyerick, Jim Sciutto and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Witness: ""In this little city, everybody heard the sound""

"(CNN)When the Dalai Lama attends the National Prayer Breakfast this Thursday, it will not only be an implicit endorsement of the Tibetan Buddhist leader's stand against China in the name of religious freedom, but also an acknowledgment that Buddhism is firmly established as one strand among many in the tapestry of American spiritual diversity. Yet it might also serve as a reminder that a religion now considered universally benign once endured suspicion, vocal protest and even government surveillance -- much as Islam has in recent years. Already, 2015 has seen threats of violence canceling a call to prayer in North Carolina, anti-Muslim demonstrations in Texas and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal comparing non-assimilating Muslims to an ""invasion."" All of this would have been familiar to some Buddhists not so long ago. Today, Buddhism is the model of a minority religious tradition that exerts an influence far beyond what its numbers would suggest. While the Buddhist population of the United States is not much larger than a million -- less than 1% of the population -- the number of Americans inspired by the Buddha is estimated to be more than 10 times that size. The cultural position of Buddhism 73 years ago could not have been more different. When Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, authorizing the evacuation of all those of Japanese descent from the West Coast to war relocation centers, the Buddhist faith practiced by many Japanese Americans was itself regarded as a potential threat. After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the formal entry of the United States into World War II, the FBI compiled a list of suspected collaborators that included not only members of groups with political ties to Japan, but the leaders of Buddhist temples. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's Custodial Detention List used a classification system designating the supposed risk of individuals on an A-B-C scale, with an ""A"" assigned to those deserving greatest suspicion. In Hoover's system, Buddhist priests were designated ""A-1"": ""dangerous enemy aliens"" whose arrest was considered a matter of urgent concern. Even before the war, Japanese Buddhists were thought to be less ""Americanized"" than their countrymen who had converted to Christianity, and in some ways this was true. Within the Japanese immigrant community, Buddhists were more likely than Christians to maintain their native language, as well as their facility with customs and rituals performed in that language. They were also more likely than Japanese Christians to read publications concerned with political affairs in the country they left behind. Subscription rolls of such publications provided the FBI with a starting point for building its ""A"" list of suspects. Because of the connections and traditional knowledge Buddhist temples helped maintain, to be a Japanese Buddhist in America was to be considered a risk to national security. Facing such scrutiny, many Buddhists enlisted for military service to prove their loyalty and patriotism. The famous 442nd Combat Regiment was not only entirely Japanese, but it was largely Buddhist. It became the most decorated infantry regiment in Europe. In the Pacific theater, 6,000 American servicemen of Japanese descent -- again, many Buddhists among them -- worked as linguists and code breakers, hastening the end of the war. In the wake of these accomplishments, Japanese American veterans petitioned the military throughout the late 1940s to add a Buddhist designation to dog tags and grave markers, which before had offered only markings signifying Protestant, Catholic, Hebrew and Other. Their eventual victory opened up the U.S. armed forces to recognition of all other faiths. Coming during a time of increasing anti-Muslim rhetoric, and during the month in which the internment of Buddhists and other Japanese Americans is commemorated, the Dalai Lama's presence at the National Prayer Breakfast offers an opportunity for the politicians and faith leaders in attendance to reaffirm a basic truth too often forgotten in our history: In a nation that cherishes religious freedom and hopes to see it spread across the globe, targeting one spiritual tradition diminishes them all.","The Dalai Lama will attend the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday with President Obama .

"Washington (CNN)The serious escalation of fighting in Ukraine is pushing President Barack Obama closer to the proxy war with Russia that he has long sought to avoid. That prospect is increasing as the United States openly accuses its former Cold War foe of sending tanks and troops in unmarked uniforms across the border into eastern Ukraine, boosting separatists in their battle against Kiev's beleaguered forces. The revelations are sharpening Obama's dilemma as his White House considers whether to send ""lethal"" weapons, including anti-tank and anti-mortar systems to the outgunned Ukrainian armed forces. Obama's nominee to become the next Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter, bolstered that idea during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Carter said he was ""very much inclined"" to support sending what the administration calls ""lethal"" defensive arms to the Ukraine government. ""We need to support the Ukrainians in defending themselves,"" he said. Such a step could take the worst East-West confrontation since the Cold War into a new and unpredictable stage. In effect, Washington would be sending weapons to be used against Russian forces at a time when the Kremlin is increasingly hostile to the West and has shown it is ready to escalate a showdown. There is no guarantee that funneling sophisticated U.S. armaments into the conflict could be decisive, and the gambit could antagonize Vladimir Putin, Russia's increasingly isolated and hard-to-read leader.  In a sign of possible administration push back against Carter's remarks, the top NATO general Philip Breedlove told the Associated Press in an interview on Thursday that arming Ukraine could spark a ""more strident"" reaction from Russia. White House spokesman Josh Earnest meanwhile offered what appeared to be a rebuke of Carter on Wednesday, saying ""a decision like this will be made by the Commander-in-Chief,"" in a reminder of where power over national security lies in this administration. The United States also wants to avoid a complete breakdown in ties and a return to the great power competition of the Soviet era, partly because it needs Russian help on key strategic issues, including nuclear talks with Iran, the chaos in the Middle East and in Afghanistan. Eugene Rumer, who served as national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the US National Intelligence Council from 2010 until last year, said that arming Ukraine would prolong a conflict Kiev cannot win outright. ""This proposal will not deter Putin. So it is both insufficient but it also is dangerous,"" Rumer said.  ""Dangerous because it could take us in a direction that we have not thought about and those consequences are quite real."" He went on:""Putin has so far been willing and demonstrated an ability to escalate despite the breakdown in relations with Europe and the U.S., despite the economic  fallout, despite the sanctions, despite the price of oil."" But the idea of arming Ukraine is nonetheless on the table because its armed forces have suffered heavy defeats in eastern regions to separatists which have been well supplied by Moscow and apparently bolstered by Russian troops. Secretary of State John Kerry significantly hardened the U.S. tone on the conflict after arriving in Kiev on Thursday to meet President Petro Poroshenko. ""We cannot close our eyes to tanks that are crossing the border from Russia and coming into Ukraine, we cannot close our eyes to Russian fighters in unmarked uniforms crossing the borders, and leading individual companies of so-called separatists into battle,"" Kerry said. The top US diplomat also said that modern weapons, including rockets were flowing across the border into eastern Ukraine in breach of a peace deal signed by Russian, the Kiev government and separatists last year. Since then Russian-backed forces have seized large swathes of territory on eastern Ukraine. Since the start of the conflict, the U.S. has sent military aid including night vision goggles to Ukraine, but stopped short of sending lethal items. But Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice are now open to considering a change of policy, officials tell CNN. The aim would be to increase the military cost for Russia's activity in Ukraine in a bid to convince the Kremlin to seek a diplomatic way out. The push to arm Ukraine got another boost this week with a report by a group of eight influential foreign policy scholars -- including several former senior Obama appointees. The group called on Obama to spend $3 billion over three years to arm Ukraine with lethal defensive weapons. Obama insists that the Western sanctions, which have hammered Russia's economy, are exacting a painful cost for Russia's moves in Ukraine. But while that price is high, it has yet to change Putin's behavior in a conflict which started with the annexation of Crimea last year. That reality is fueling calls on both sides of the aisle in Congress for tougher US action. ""The only thing that deters Putin is a show of strength,"" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff told CNN on Thursday. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, meanwhile, said Putin was a ""schoolyard bully"" picking on the weakest member of the class. ""It's time to provide Ukraine the ability to defend itself,"" she said. Administration officials insist that no decisions have yet been made to increase U.S. assistance to Ukraine. White House officials declined to comment on the president's deliberations for this story. Those urging Obama to go ahead with an effort to arm Ukraine argue that he must make the point that flagrant violations of international order perpetrated by Putin in Ukraine are unacceptable. ""A person like Putin understands power,"" said Ivo Daalder, Obama's former ambassador to NATO, who joined the group of prominent scholars, who also included former Clinton deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott and Michele Flournoy, who is often spoken about as a possible secretary of defense for Hillary Clinton. ""Our unwillingness even to contemplate providing defensive weapons sends a signal that we are not particularly serious about Ukraine's capacity to defend itself or in upholding these fundamental rules of international order,"" Daalder said. The group called on Obama to provide equipment including drones, secure communications facilities, armored Humvees, as well as light anti-armor missiles, to target Russian armored vehicles. ""Only if the Kremlin knows that the risks and the costs of further military action are high, will it seek to find an acceptable political solution,"" the report warned. The authors said that the West faced a critical moment with Russia -- saying that if Moscow succeeds in dismembering Ukraine, it could be emboldened to undermine the security order elsewhere in Europe. ""It might tempt President Putin to use his doctrine of protecting ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in seeking territorial changes elsewhere in the neighborhood, including in the Baltic states, provoking a direct challenge with NATO,"" the report warned. The new moment of confrontation with the Kremlin was also reflected in Obama's new national security strategy which was released on Friday. ""We will continue to impose significant costs on Russia through sanctions and other means while countering Moscow's deceptive propaganda with the unvarnished truth. We will deter Russian aggression, remain alert to its strategic capabilities, and help our allies and partners resist Russian coercion over the long term, if necessary,"" the White House strategy said. The serious deterioration of Russia-U.S. relations can be seen by comparing the document to the previous national security strategy, released in 2010, which speaks of cooperation with ""allies and partners around the world, including Russia and touts the achievements of Obama's first term ""reset"" of relations with the Kremlin. As he ponders whether to risk worsening the relationship with Russia still further by arming Ukraine, Obama could face resistance on the world stage. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the most powerful European leader, has already made clear Germany will not supply weapons to Kiev. Merkel, who will meet Obama at the White House on Monday, arrived in Moscow on Friday with French President Francois Hollande, seeking to convince Putin to sign on to a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and a long term peace plan. Some Russian experts believe a move to arm Ukraine could backfire, and play into Putin's conspiratorial mindset. Sean Kay, an expert on Russia and NATO at Ohio Wesleyan University said that Putin could also swiftly increase Russian assistance to rebels in a bid to lock in quick battlefield gains. He said it would be six months to a year before a U.S. operation could have a measurable effect on the situation on the ground in Ukraine. ""The moment Putin thinks this weaponry is coming in, he could dramatically escalate things in a very dangerous way to take advantage of the current window,"" he said.","U.S. considering sending arms to Ukraine .
But critics fear move could escalate US-Russia showdown .
No one knows how Putin would respond ."
"Michael Douglas never had throat cancer, as he told the press in 2010. The actor now says he had tongue cancer. Douglas said he hid the diagnosis at the urging of his doctor to protect his career. ""The surgeon said, 'Let's just say it's throat cancer,' "" Douglas told fellow actor Samuel L. Jackson for a segment that ran on British television as a part of Male Cancer Awareness Week. Douglas says that the doctor told him if they had to do surgery for tongue cancer, ""it's not going to be pretty. You could lose part of your tongue and jaw."" When Douglas first talked about his cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2010, he was on a worldwide publicity tour for the movie ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps."" Douglas and Jackson joked that could have been the end of his acting career.  Douglas said if he had surgery he could see the director saying, ""What's your good side? I've got no side over here."" The lesson from Michael Douglas . ""There really is no such thing as throat cancer per se,"" explained Brian Hill, an oral cancer survivor and the founder of the Oral Cancer Foundation. Douglas has taped a public service announcement to raise awareness about oral cancer for Hill's foundation. ""Throat"" cancer and tongue cancer are both colloquial terms that fall under the oral cancer umbrella. Throat cancer usually refers to cancerous tumors that develop in your pharynx, voice box or tonsils. Tongue cancer refers to cancerous cells that develop on your tongue. ""The treatment up until just recently can be very brutal,"" Hill said of tongue cancer. ""Your career as a leading man could be over. If you have signed a contract to promote a movie, you would have a strong motivation not to say ... 'Maybe in six months I won't have a tongue or lower jaw.' "" Douglas apparently did not need the potentially disfiguring surgery.  He told Jackson he was instead treated with an aggressive form of radiation and chemotherapy. The treatment, he said, lasted five months. Yes, oral sex can lead to cancer . In June, Douglas kicked off an animated conversation about the cause of oral cancer when he told The Guardian that he got throat cancer after engaging in oral sex. Oral sex can expose individuals to the human papilloma virus, which can cause cancer. Later, Douglas' publicist told CNN that Douglas did not blame HPV solely for his cancer; Douglas said he was also a smoker and a drinker.  Smoking and drinking, particularly when combined, are considered the most significant contributing factors to oral cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So is Douglas' gender. Men are twice as likely to develop oral cancer as women. Oral cancers account for 2% to 4% of all cancer diagnoses in the United States. An oral cancer diagnosis is particularly serious; only half of the people diagnosed with oral cancer are still alive after five years, according to the CDC.  In large part, that's because of the late diagnoses of this disease.  Most signs of this cancer are difficult to detect and are often painless. Douglas told Jackson that initially his doctors treated him with antibiotics.  Douglas had been complaining of a soreness at the back of his teeth.  Three months later when it still hurt, the doctor gave him another round of antibiotics.  Nine months later, after talking to a friend who was a cancer survivor, he went to the oncology department where a doctor did an initial exam and then a biopsy.  He was diagnosed with stage four oral cancer in 2010. Michael Douglas has overcome throat cancer, he says . Douglas is not the first celebrity to misidentify the kind of cancer they have. Actress Valerie Harper, who first came to fame on the TV show ""Mary Tyler Moore,"" announced her cancer on the cover of People magazine in March. The story said she had little time left to live and was suffering from terminal brain cancer.  It turns out the ""Dancing With the Stars"" celebrity actually had lung cancer that had spread to the lining of her brain. ""I see a lot of people with 'brain cancer' who actually have... lung cancer or breast cancer or some other cancer (that spread) to the brain,"" Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical and science officer, told CNN. ""We treat cancer according to its origin."" Harper's kind of cancer, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, can be slowed but the cells are adaptable and can develop a resistance to treatment.  A complete remission is unlikely. Douglas, on the other hand, has had regular check-ups since the diagnosis.  At his two-year mark, he told Jackson, his doctors said he was clear of the cancer. ""There is a 95% chance it's not coming back,"" he told Jackson.","Actor Michael Douglas says he hid his tongue cancer at his doctor's urging .
Treatment can come with disfiguring surgery to remove the tongue or part of the jaw .
The CDC estimates only half of those diagnosed with oral cancer survive ."
"Charles Davis didn't sense a great deal of excitement leading up to Ferguson, Missouri, elections on Tuesday. His Ferguson Burger Bar & More is situated along the primary protest route in the city. People have streamed in and out of the eatery since it opened just before Michael Brown was shot in August. Along with handmade burgers and milkshakes, his patrons have been able to pick up voter registration forms from the counter where they place their orders. While Davis saw voters wearing stickers and some customers mentioned the elections, it wasn't a regular point of discussion in the days before the polls opened. ""A lot of people didn't talk about it,"" he said. ""It was a dead conversation."" Davis, who is registered to vote in Illinois but whose wife voted in Ferguson on Tuesday, concedes that general and midterm elections don't excite him. But in April 2015, when city elections are held? When three of the six City Council seats will be up for grabs? Now, that's a different story. ""That, I would definitely be excited,"" he said. ""They're going to have to make some changes. It's not going to be the same ol', same ol', so I'm excited."" Numbers game . Since Officer Darren Wilson killed the unarmed Brown on a Ferguson street, much has been made of the city's supposed history of poor voter turnout. In a city that is two-thirds black, how, many asked, could the police force and local government be so overwhelmingly white? Even at Brown's funeral, some speakers used the occasion to call for social change, with one of Brown's cousins urging those in attendance to make their voices heard at the polls because ""we have had enough of seeing our brothers and sisters killed in the streets."" To put it bluntly, voter turnout for Ferguson township was far from historic. Of 24,334 registered voters, 10,222 cast ballots in Tuesday's election, a turnout of slightly more than 42%, according to an initial tally. There wasn't a wave of new voters, either, as only 204 residents registered to vote between August 11, the Monday after Brown was shot, and October 8, the registration deadline for Tuesday's election, said Rita Days, St. Louis County's director of elections. Fifty-six additional residents have registered since October 8, she said. Of course, 42% is only the initial tally, and the county has two weeks to verify that figure with the state, so the number could rise or drop, Days said. Still, she felt it was a strong turnout. ""This is a very big number considering the last mayoral election, when Mayor (James) Knowles was elected -- that was 16%,"" Days said. But comparing municipal to general and midterm election turnouts is apple and oranges, Knowles said in an email. Since 16.2% of voters first put Knowles in office in 2011, voter turnout for the annual city elections has never topped 12%. The 2012 general election, however, lured 76.4% of voters to the polls. Alternate views . Turnout, Knowles said, is dependent on a variety of factors, including top-tier races on the ballot, the number of contested races, tax increases and the weather. ""Turnout is low in all municipal elections, period,"" he wrote. ""To try and compare April municipal election turnout numbers to November general election turnout numbers, and interpolating something about what has been going on here with that data would be dishonest."" Asked their impression of Tuesday's turnout, Knowles and the six City Council members declined to share their sentiments on the numbers. ""I want to thank everyone that took the time to come out in the dreary weather to exercise their right to vote,"" Knowles said. ""I hope that our citizens will continue to engage in the community and be educated and active participants in government every day of the year."" While he didn't want to characterize the turnout number as good or bad, the mayor pointed out that 42% lags behind the county's preliminary number of 44%. It's also below the county's totals of 55.8% (2010) and 63.4% (2006) in comparable midterm elections. County election records show it's also about 10 percentage points lower than Ferguson's turnout in the 2010 midterm, which saw 52.2% of registered voters cast ballots, and about 15 points lower than the city's 2006 turnout. ""Turnout in elections all across St. Louis County has been going down for years,"" Knowles said. Others saw the numbers as a positive sign that voters are making sure their voices are heard in the voting booths. ""A big shout-out to the protesters who took their protest from the street to the ballot box,"" said community activist and Ferguson native John Gaskin. Protests have been a mainstay on Ferguson's streets since Brown was killed, with demonstrators calling for Officer Wilson to face charges and lambasting what they felt was a heavy-handed police response to the protests. A grand jury is expected to decide soon whether Wilson will be charged with any crime, and Knowles told local media this week authorities to expect demonstrations and ""prepare for the worst."" Some voters undeterred . Gaskin called Tuesday's turnout ""significant"" when you consider that the August primaries, held nine days after Brown was shot, drew only 25.8% of voters to the polls. He also lauded those who braved a chilly autumn rain to vote, despite an underwhelming ballot on which two congressional seats and the county executive post were highlights. Precipitation wasn't the only factor vexing voters. There were other minor problems, said Days, the election director. Two of the 11 city precincts ran low on paper ballots, causing delays, a complaint officials heard throughout the county, she said. Days also received a report from a local news outlet about ballot tampering at one precinct, but the media outlet did not provide her with basic details of the allegation, she said. The Washington-based Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which set up a hotline to report voting irregularities, received complaints that poll workers were requesting voters' photo IDs, which Missouri law doesn't require, and there were at least a couple of calls ""about potential police intimidations at the polling place,"" said the committee's director of public policy, Tanya Clay House. Gaskin heard reports that people were standing in line as long as an hour in some Ferguson and St. Louis County precincts, and he was impressed by the outcome of the races for county prosecuting attorney and county executive. The latter went down to the wire, and preliminary numbers show it will likely be decided by less than 1 percent of the vote. In the prosecutor's race, incumbent Robert McCulloch, who has faced criticism for his handling of the Brown case, ran unopposed, yet more than 11,000 voters cast write-in votes. McCulloch was handily re-elected, but the write-ins composed almost 5% of the vote. By comparison, the second-highest number of write-ins came in the county executive race, with 3,713, according to unofficial numbers. ""St. Louis County is realizing not only do black lives matter, but it's quite obvious that so do their votes,"" Gaskin said, applauding Ferguson voters for ""turning anger and frustration into real, productive action."" Looking ahead . Engagement could be higher, Gaskin said, but he suspects that it will be come April. There are already ""some conversations on who's going to run,"" which he believes is ""definitely healthy for a community that needs to get politically engaged,"" he said. There is a feeling among many residents that local leaders are ""insensitive, unaware of what's going on or not being honest with the public,"" he said. ""I think many people feel that way, and it will show at the ballot box,"" he said. ""There are people in office in the city of Ferguson that need to be re-evaluated. I think the community -- you can see from the turnout numbers -- is taking note of that."" During his phone interview from Ferguson Burger Bar & More, Davis said he felt Gaskin's prediction was apt and shared a thought he's sure will be unpopular. The community doesn't want to think about it because it's grieving and still in pain, he said, but if you can find anything positive in Brown's death, it's that residents are thirsty and excited for change. Maybe that was God's plan, he posited. ""If none of that was going on, nothing would change. It'd be the same as it's been the last 60 years,"" he said. ""A lot of unfortunate situations bring about positive situations, silver linings.""","10,222 of Ferguson's 24,334 registered voters cast ballots in election, official says .

On this particular November afternoon, Poulter is clad in a crisp, white shirt and stonewash jeans. Slim and athletic, he appears both smart and casual. But compared to his usual look on the golf course, Poulter's sporting a surprisingly reserved look when we meet. Famed for his fierce will to win and outrageous attire -- he's big on bold, vibrant checks -- the Briton has coupled a successful sporting career with launching his own clothing label -- which is now in its seventh year. IJP Design, so named after its founder's initials, can trace its roots back to the gritty surroundings of Stevenage Indoor Market --  on the outskirts of London. Long before making his fortune on the golf course, this was where Poulter first forayed into the rag trade -- and where he learned some important life lessons. Notably to keep your options open and have a plan B. ""I went with a school friend of mine,"" Poulter, a winner of 16 professional titles who has earned over $27 million in prize money on the European Tour alone, tells CNN. ""I needed some extra spare cash, so I was talking to my mate who used to pack away and set up stalls. He said, 'Why don't you come with me?' ""That was at the age of 11, so that's what I did on a Saturday and took it from there really. I enjoyed that."" The competitive drive which has served the 38-year-old Poulter so well during his golf career was also perfectly suited to a market stall's cut and thrust. ""I was 13 or 14 when (the owner) decided to allow me to run the stall while he went on holiday ... I set it up and I carried the cash bag,"" said the 38-year-old, recalling those early days of entrepreneurship. ""It was quite daunting but back then I was a little money maker."" Over the years, Poulter's revenue stream has widened and the bags of cash have grown exponentially. He's won titles on both the prestigious PGA and European Tours and is famed for his Ryder Cup heroics, particularly when he powered Europe to an improbable comeback against the U.S. at Medinah in 2012. But while chipping, driving and putting his way to a succession of titles, Poulter's interest in sartorial elegance never diminished. Golf prides itself on the very best dress etiquette, but Poulter has done his best to shake things up a little. During the 2004 British Open, he took to the course at the Royal Troon Golf Club in Scotland wearing a pair of Union Jack trousers. Since then the bleach-blonde boy from Stevenage has graced the fairways draped in an eclectic mix of designs and even a soccer shirt -- he is a huge fan of English Premier League team Arsenal. ""I wear what I want to wear as opposed to wearing what someone else wants me to wear,"" he said. ""I'm quite a control freak from that standpoint. I like what I wear, so it's good for me to be able to promote that."" Many might have laughed and dismissed them as misguided outfit choices, but Poulter's street trading instincts told him he was on to a lucrative business venture. ""I felt that we would continue the one-off outfits and see where it took us,"" he recalls. ""Shortly after that I realised that we had a business opportunity there."" Poulter is happy to delegate the design end of the business to the experts but he takes a keen interest in what they are doing. ""I don't personally put pen to paper, I have a design team that do that for me and they do a good job. ""It's about them coming up with fresh ideas, making sure the fabrics are moving with the times and making sure the color palettes and everything go with that."" Despite successfully launching IJP and enjoying a lucrative golf career, there remains one notable gap on Poulter's resume -- a major championship. But Poulter dismisses suggestions he'll be best remembered for his trousers rather than his trophies, insisting that he is simply well prepared for life after sport. ""I've got 14 titles (two on the PGA Tour, 12 on the European) to my name and a pretty good Ryder Cup record, so I think that outweighs the business side of things,"" he said. ""I think in a few years' time, if I sit back and look at the trophy cabinet and make sure I've got a successful business, then I've done my job. ""I wouldn't want to be in a position where my golf career has finished and then I'm trying to start a business. So trying to do the whole thing together is probably the right thing."" So, three decades on from his first foray into the world of retail, what would the teenage market trader make of IJP Design? ""I think he'd be pretty happy to be honest,"" replies Poulter. ""The quality is very good. I think its premium, so the stall would look nice and smart. ""He'd be very happy.""","Ian Poulter has played on the European & PGA Tours .

"President Barack Obama said he identified the September 11 assault on the U.S. Consulate in Libya as a terrorist attack within a day; former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said it took two weeks. A timeline of the Obama administration's comments on the Libya attack . The claim: ""The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened,"" Obama said. ""That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime."" The counterclaim:  ""It took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror,"" Romney responded moments later. The facts: On September 12, the day after the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Obama said in comments in the Rose Garden that he had learned about the attack on the consulate the night before. Fact Check: What about the security in Benghazi? ""Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe,"" he said. ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done."" Opinion: Do facts even matter? On September 13, at a campaign event in Las Vegas, Obama vowed to bring the killers to justice. He then added, ""No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America."" Other administration officials, however, said in subsequent days that they were unaware of any credible intelligence suggesting that the attack had been planned in advance. On September 13, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, said authorities ""are very cautious about drawing any conclusions with regard to who the perpetrators were, what their motivations were, (and) whether it was premeditated"" until they had completed an investigation. On September 16, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said, ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned."" On September 19, Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that the ambassador and three other Americans ""were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy."" White House spokesman Jay Carney sought to clear up any confusion on September 20. ""It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials."" On September 25, on ABC's ""The View,"" interviewer Joy Behar asked Obama about a remark made by his secretary of state. ""I heard Hillary Clinton say it was an act of terrorism. Is it? What do you say?"" To that, Obama responded, ""We're still doing an investigation. There's no doubt that (with) the kind of weapons that were used, the ongoing assault, that it wasn't just a mob action. We don't have all the information yet, so we're still gathering it. But what's clear is that around the world there's still a lot of threats out there."" Obama added that ""extremist militias"" were suspected to have been involved. Fact Check: Did Obama say he wants 'daylight' between U.S., Israel? Two days later, Carney responded bluntly to a question about why Obama had not labeled the incident a terrorist attack. ""I think you're misunderstanding something here,"" Carney said. ""I'm the president's spokesman.  When the head of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matt Olsen, in open testimony in Congress, answered a question by saying yes, by the definitions we go by -- this is me paraphrasing -- this was a terrorist attack -- I echoed that, because this president, this administration, everybody looks to the intelligence community for the assessments on this.  And it has been since I said so, the president's position that this was a terrorist attack."" The conclusion: Romney's precise comment was false. Obama did describe the killings in Benghazi as an act of terror twice in the two days after the attack. In an interview two weeks after the incident, though, he appeared to reserve judgment, and some Obama administration officials, including Carney and Rice, suggested in the days after the attack that the United States had no indication that it was a planned assault.

"American intelligence leaker Edward Snowden met with human rights activists and lawyers Friday in a transit zone of a Russian airport, in his first public appearance since he left Hong Kong on June 23. The event prompted the White House to criticize Russia for giving Snowden a ""propaganda platform,"" and later in the day, President Barack Obama spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""The two leaders noted the importance of U.S.-Russian bilateral relations and discussed a range of security and bilateral issues, including the status of Mr. Edward Snowden and cooperation on counterterrorism in the lead-up to the Sochi Winter Olympics,"" a White House statement said. Snowden told the activists he was requesting asylum from Russia while he awaited safe passage to Latin America, according to a transcript of Snowden's statement to the activists, issued via WikiLeaks. The presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia have said their countries would give him asylum, and Nicaragua's president said he would offer it ""if circumstances permit."" ""I announce today my formal acceptance of all offers of support or asylum I have been extended and all others that may be offered in the future,"" Snowden's statement said. ""As we have seen, however, some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law, and this behavior persists today. This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights."" Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing their contacts with their Russian counterparts to learn whatever they can about Russia's intentions in the Snowden case, and to press for his return to America, a U.S. official told CNN on Friday. White House spokesman Jay Carney warned Russia about providing asylum to Snowden and criticized the country for ""providing a propaganda platform"" to Snowden. But Carney added the administration didn't want the case to cause undue harm to U.S. relations with Moscow. That platform ""runs counter to the Russian government's previous declarations of Russia's neutrality and that they have no control over his presence in the airport,"" he said. ""It is also incompatible with Russian assurances that they do not want Mr. Snowden to further damage U.S. interests."" Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, is believed to have been holed up in a transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport since leaving Hong Kong for Russia. In an invitation to the meeting purportedly e-mailed by Snowden on Thursday, he cited the temporary grounding of Bolivian President Evo Morales' plane last week as he accused the United States of ""threatening behavior"" on an unprecedented scale. The jet, which had left Moscow, was forced to land in Austria after other European countries allegedly closed their airspace amid suspicions that Snowden was aboard. Snowden said he was submitting a request to Russia for asylum Friday ""until such time as these states accede to law and my legal travel is permitted."" But the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service, Konstantin Romodanovsky, told Russian news agency Interfax Saturday that no application from Snowden had yet been received. ""If we receive an application, it will be considered in due process of law,"" Romodanovsky is quoted as saying. 'I have no regrets' In his remarks, Snowden also sought to defend his actions in leaking documents to the media that exposed U.S. mass surveillance programs. ""I did what I believed right and began a campaign to correct this wrongdoing. I did not seek to enrich myself. I did not seek to sell US secrets. I did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety. Instead, I took what I knew to the public, so what affects all of us can be discussed by all of us in the light of day, and I asked the world for justice,"" he said. ""That moral decision to tell the public about spying that affects all of us has been costly, but it was the right thing to do and I have no regrets."" Snowden asked the rights groups present to lobby the Russian government to grant him temporary asylum, said Russian Human Rights Watch representative Tanya Lokshina, who was at the meeting. According to WikiLeaks, Lokshina told Snowden that on her way to the airport, she received a call from the U.S. ambassador to Russia. He asked her to relay to Snowden that the U.S. government does not consider him to be a whistle-blower and that he has broken United States law, the group said. A photograph provided by a Russian Human Rights Watch staffer at the meeting showed Snowden sitting behind a desk, flanked by a WikiLeaks staffer, looking much as he did when last photographed in Hong Kong. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website, has been aiding Snowden in his bids for asylum. Russian television aired an amateur video of Snowden delivering remarks to the activists. ""A little over one month ago, I had family, a home in paradise, and I lived in great comfort. I also had the capability without any warrant to search for, seize, and read your communications. Anyone's communications at any time. That is the power to change people's fates.  It is also a serious violation of the law,"" he said. ""The immoral cannot be made moral through the use of secret law. I believe in the principle declared at Nuremberg in 1945: Individuals have international duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience. Therefore individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity from occurring,"" Snowden said. Russian asylum conditions? Snowden's desire to be granted temporary asylum in Russia may represent something of a turnaround. He last week reportedly withdrew an asylum request with Russian authorities after President Vladimir Putin said he would have to ""stop his work aimed at harming our American partners"" if he wanted to stay in the country. ""Snowden did voice a request to remain in Russia,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on July 2, according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. ""Then, yesterday, hearing President Putin outline Russia's position regarding the conditions under which he could do this, he withdrew his request for permission to stay in Russia."" It's not clear if a request for temporary asylum would entail different conditions. But a Russian lawmaker who was at Friday's meeting, Vyacheslav Nikonov, told state news agency Itar-Tass that Snowden had said he did not intend to cause any further damage to the United States. ""I've said all I knew and I will not harm the United States in the future,"" Snowden said, according to Nikonov. The United States has reached out to the Russians regarding Snowden's meeting with human rights groups, two senior State Department officials told CNN. Passport revoked . Snowden has been technically a free man while in Moscow but has been unable to travel after U.S. authorities revoked his passport when he was charged with espionage. The many mysteries of Snowden's transit zone . Sergei Nikitin, head of Amnesty International's Moscow office, who was at the meeting, said he was pleased to voice the organization's support for Snowden in person. ""We will continue to pressure governments to ensure his rights are respected -- this includes the unassailable right to claim asylum wherever he may choose,"" he said in a statement. ""What he has disclosed is patently in the public interest and as a whistle-blower his actions were justified."" Snowden exposed unlawful sweeping surveillance programs, and states that try to prevent him from revealing such unlawful behavior ""are flouting international law,"" Nikitin said. ""Instead of addressing or even owning up to these blatant breaches, the U.S. government is more intent on persecuting him. Attempts to pressure governments to block his efforts to seek asylum are deplorable,"" he said. Jamil Dakwar, human rights program director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the United States has a long history of supporting asylum rights, but in the case of Snowden, it ""has improperly interfered with the right of asylum by revoking his passport and exerting extraordinary pressure on countries to reject his requests. ""Snowden's claims for asylum deserve fair consideration, and U.S. actions to secure his extradition must take place within an acceptable legal framework protecting his right to seek asylum."" U.S. accused of 'unlawful campaign' The transit zone meeting with Snowden began at around 5 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET). A CNN team at the airport saw about half a dozen people -- including Russia's human rights ombudsman and representatives of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Russian human rights groups -- enter a door marked ""Private"" in Terminal E. Police and security officers then kept the media at a distance. The letter purportedly e-mailed by Snowden to invite them to the meeting blasted the United States for carrying out illegal actions against him. In the letter -- posted on the Facebook page of Lokshina, the Russian Human Rights Watch staffer -- the writer praised the ""brave countries"" that have offered him support, in the face of what he described as ""an unlawful campaign by officials in the U.S. Government to deny my right to seek and enjoy this asylum."" In her Facebook post, Lokshina said she received the e-mailed invitation close to 5 p.m. Thursday and acknowledged that she did not know beforehand if it was real. A large group of Russian and international journalists gathered at the airport in anticipation of the meeting. Latin American asylum offers . Since his arrival in Moscow, Snowden -- who faces espionage charges in the United States -- has requested asylum in dozens of countries, sparking a surge in speculation about his next steps. Is Snowden worth the risk? Latin America weighs the pros and cons . Snowden has admitted releasing classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs to the media and argues that he did so to expose serious violations of the U.S. Constitution. He is slammed as a traitor by critics and hailed as a hero by his supporters. WikiLeaks said in a Twitter post Wednesday that Snowden's ""flight of liberty"" campaign was starting, promising further details. But details about where Snowden is going -- and how he'll get there -- have remained hard to come by. U.S. officials told Chinese officials in Washington this week that they're disappointed with the way China and Hong Kong handled the Snowden case, saying their actions undermined trust. China said that Hong Kong authorities acted in accordance with the law.","Snowden has not yet submitted an asylum application, migration chief tells Russian media .

"After meeting with NAACP leaders in Ferguson, Missouri, Sen. Rand Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the Republicans Party's biggest mistake in recent decades has been not reaching out to African-American voters. The Kentucky Republican, who said his meeting went ""very well,"" said he laid out his views on demilitarizing police, reforming the criminal justice system and boosting urban economies. ""I don't want to characterize how everybody else feels about what I said, but I think it was a good opening to the conversation,"" Paul said in an interview set to air Friday. ""I think in the Republican Party, the biggest mistake we've made in the last several decades is we haven't gone into the African American community, into the NAACP and say you know what, we are concerned about what's going on in your cities and we have plans. They may be different than the Democrats, but we do have plans and we do want to help."" According to his office, participants in the meeting included members of the NAACP, the Urban League and several local business and church leaders. Paul was one of the most outspoken Republicans about the police response to protests that followed the August shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager who was killed by a police officer in Ferguson. Angry demonstrations erupted this week in St. Louis after another black teenager was fatally shot by a white police officer. Supporters of Brown were set to begin a weekend of marches and civil disobedience on Friday, dubbed the ""Weekend of Resistance."" ""There's a sense of tension and unease that goes beyond just the shootings. I think the shooting has brought this to the surface, but there's a sense of unease in the country,"" Paul told Blitzer. ""Black unemployment is twice white unemployment and has been for decade after decade,"" he added. ""I know this president cares about trying to improve it but it hasn't gotten better."" Paul, who's seriously considering a run for president, discouraged violent reactions to the shootings, saying ""violence gets nowhere, and it actually sends us backwards."" He instead encouraged people to channel any anger into registering voters. ""Then you could have constructive change in the community,"" he continued, adding that the leaders of the community ""realize that."" Rand Paul: 'Fight for justice now' on unfair sentencing . Asked by Blitzer if Paul thinks he could garner African American support in a run for president, Paul said Republicans ""won't ever win again"" unless they start competing for minority voters. ""We will not win again in our country because the country is a diverse country now,"" he said. ""And we can't have one party that monopolizes the various ethnic group votes."" Paul said in the meeting he proposed his ""economic freedom zones"" plan, which would aim to give tax incentives and financial breaks to depressed areas and neighborhoods in large cities, with the ultimate goal of stimulating the economy and drawing in more business. ""By dramatically lowering taxes in a city like Ferguson, you would have more job opportunities, less tension, and less of sort of this problem that develops from crime,"" he said. Rand Paul: Police militarization, war on drugs is 'out of control' The first-term senator stressed that his libertarian-leanings on the war on drugs makes it ""pretty easy"" for him to speak out on the issue. He also highlighted legislation he's proposed that would reform drug sentences and restore voting fights for felons convicted of nonviolent drug crimes. The senator has also been actively fighting against a Defense Department program that that provides military equipment to local police forces, emphasizing that the use of such equipment has gotten out of hand â€” especially when it comes to the war on drugs. ""We've got no business having no-knock raids at one in the morning, scaring the bejeezus out of people and getting them frightened,"" he said. ""Drugs are a scourge. We need to keep our young people from using them...But we need not to be filling up our prisons with these kids. We need not to be breaking down doors at two in the morning looking for drugs, sometimes in the wrong house."" His outreach to African-Americans comes after he was criticized in 2010 for questioning a portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act dealing with the rights of private property owners to turn certain people away. Paul argued earlier this week in an interview that he was ""just a physician in a small town"" at the time of his comments. ""Do you learn more about issues over time? Sure, but I was never against the Civil Rights Act,"" he said. Can Rand Paul break past controversy over Civil Rights Act? John Gaskin III, spokesman for St. Louis County NAACP, said in a statement that Paul had called the local leaders to have a meeting. ""We were honored to have an informative discussion about the Senator regarding ways that he can help to assist our civil rights agenda in Washington and help to end police militarization,"" Gaskin said.","Rand Paul talked to CNN's Wolf Blitzer about his meeting in Ferguson, Missouri with the NAACP.
He said Republicans have made a big mistake by not reaching out to black voters.
Paul believes that local police forces have become too militarized.
He also says he has solutions to help decrease ""racial outcomes"" in the war on drugs."
"This year is on track to be one of the hottest, if not the hottest, year on record, a U.N. agency reported Wednesday, citing preliminary estimates. The estimates were released by the World Meteorological Organization to coincide with annual climate change negotiations taking place in Lima, Peru.

"(CNN)Pope Francis has reassigned a conservative American cardinal from a key post to one that is mostly symbolic. Cardinal Raymond Burke, a leading conservative, has been vocal in his criticism of the direction the Pope is leading the Catholic Church in. Burke was one of the highest ranking Americans in the church hierarchy in his position on the Vatican's supreme court. But he was reassigned to the position of Patron of the Order of Malta, the Vatican announced on Saturday. The National Catholic Reporter points out that Burke's new post is a job that ""has almost no responsibilities."" The Vatican did not give a reason for the demotion. Hard to change the Catholic Church, even if you're the Pope . The change, however, was not unexpected. Last month, Burke himself said he had been ousted from the Vatican's high court. Burke has been outspoken about his opposition to Pope Francis' move toward more openness and inclusiveness of gays and lesbians. ""The Pope is not free to change the church's teachings with regard to the immorality of homosexual acts or the insolubility of marriage or any other doctrine of the faith,"" Burke told Buzzfeed recently. When a recent draft report included a call for the church to be more welcoming to gays, Burke said the report ""lacks a solid foundation in the sacred Scriptures."" Subsequently, some of the language on the ""gifts and qualities"" that gay people can bring to the church was removed from the report. The Pope has appointed moderates in several big dioceses, including in Chicago earlier this fall, and he's removed some archconservatives from their posts. CNN's Daniel Burke contributed to this report.","The Vatican announced a new assignment for American cardinal Raymond Burke .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN)Searchers have located a majority of AirAsia Flight QZ8501's fuselage in the Java Sea, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency said Wednesday, raising the prospect that many bodies of the 162 people aboard the flight that crashed last month will soon be found. The confirmation follows major developments in the investigation of the disaster -- the recoveries earlier this week of the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders. Searchers saw the plane's main body, with one of its wings attached, via a camera carried by a remotely operated underwater vehicle, Indonesia search chief Bambang Soelistyo said. Key in identifying the debris are the words painted on the section. Pictures released by the search agency appear to show portions of the words ""now"" and ""everyone."" AirAsia says the slogan ""Now everyone can fly"" had been on the length of the plane, which crashed December 28 as it flew toward Singapore from the Indonesian city of Surabaya. Divers will search the fuselage for bodies Thursday, and if the divers encounter trouble, crews may lift the fuselage out of the water, Soelistyo said. Officials didn't mention the depth of the water. But officials have said other debris, such as the recorders -- which were found about a half mile from the fuselage on Monday and Tuesday --  were discovered at a depth of roughly 30 meters (100 feet). At least 50 bodies have been recovered from the sea, Soelistyo said. Some were strapped into seats. Officials have said that many of the more than 100 remaining bodies might be found in or near the plane's fuselage. The majority of the people on Flight QZ8501 were Indonesian. Citizens of Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea also were aboard. Soelistyo said the discovered portion of the fuselage is about 100 feet long. That would represent the majority of the Airbus A320-200, which was about 120 feet long. Authorities don't know why the plane crashed.  Roughly 35 minutes into the flight, the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather. Minutes later, the plane disappeared from radar. On Tuesday, divers retrieved the cockpit voice recorder, which is designed to retain all sounds on a plane's flight deck. A day earlier, searchers recovered the plane's other key information source, the flight data recorder, which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft's performance, including air speed and cabin pressure. Both devices are expected to help investigators understand what went wrong. The flight data recorder tells investigators what happened on a plane, but the cockpit voice recorder tells them why, said Mardjono Siswosuwarno, a senior official at Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee, which is leading the investigation into the disaster. ""The 'why' is mostly in there,"" he said of the voice recorder, which captures conversations between pilots, as well as other sounds in the cockpit. The two flight recorders were taken to a lab in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, for analysis. Investigators say they have successfully downloaded the contents of both devices. But Mardjono cautioned that interpreting the information requires much more time. After the download, investigators should have ""a pretty good idea within a couple of days"" of what happened aboard the plane, Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation, said this week. The flight data recorder usually contains hundreds of parameters and thousands of data points, she said, that look a bit like an electrocardiogram when they're printed. Mardjono said he expected a preliminary report to be released within a month of the crash. But it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public. The final report containing investigators' full conclusions will take months, Mardjono said. The agency's final report into Adam Air Flight 574 -- which crashed in Indonesian waters on New Year's Day 2007, killing all 102 people on board -- came out more than a year after that disaster. Mardjono said the AirAsia plane's flight data recorder was in good condition after being pulled out of the water from under the debris of a wing Monday. The recovery of the recorders took place after the plane's tail was lifted from the waves Saturday. Observers have suggested that the locations of the different parts of debris indicate the plane broke apart when it hit the water, not when it was still at a high altitude. One Indonesian search official, who goes by the single name of Supriyadi, said that the debris patterns suggest the aircraft ""exploded"" on impact. But the country's transportation investigators said it was premature to say what had happened, and one expert questioned the search official's choice of words. ""The word 'exploded' I think maybe loses a little bit in translation,"" said David Soucie, a former Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector. ""I think really what he's meaning is a rupture from the impact itself. ""As with any hollow object hitting something very hard, the pressure differential between the outside and the inside is very significant, and it'll actually tear apart the aircraft on the top,"" Soucie said. ""That may be what he's referring to."" CNN's David Molko, Jethro Mullen, Elizabeth Joseph, Andrew Stevens, Mitra Mobasherat, Gary Tuchman, Brian Walker, Catherine E. Shoichet, Josh Levs and Deborah E. Bloom, and journalist Rudy Madanir contributed to this report.","Fuselage found underwater, about a half mile from where data recorders were found, official says .

The mother of a 10-year-old took Fredrick up on his offer.  The 'after' photos show a boy who looks like a little old man with a pronounced bald spot. Fredrick's post has gone viral on Facebook and Instagram, generating worldwide media coverage -- both cheers and jeers. ""If my kid's grades fell, I'd do this to him, too,"" said a Facebook post by Marla-Eyvette Massie. But Samuel Thomas Duncan was not amused.  ""I'd rather punish a child at home and keep it a private matter than let someone else humiliate that child publicly,"" he said. Fredrick said he's not surprised by all the attention the new coif is getting. ""Because a lot of people are at a loss of how to discipline kids, you can't whup 'em anymore, like we used to, as children,"" the barber said.  ""It works."" The inspiration came from Fredrick's own life, when he was having trouble last year with his 12-year-old son, CNN affiliate WXIA reports. The frustrated dad told him to quit acting up in school ""like an old foolish man."" Fredrick shaved his son's head bald and then showed him a picture of an old bald man, like the character in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" ""I showed him and I told him, this is your next one if you keep it up,"" Fredrick told him.  ""He didn't want it, so he got his act together."" Not familiar with the plot of ""Benjamin Button?""  Benjamin begins life as an old man and ages in reverse. A-1 Kutz offers the ""Benjamin Button Special"" for free, but usually it doesn't come to that.  One look at the picture of the first recipient of the ""old man"" cut is enough to do the trick. As for the young man who got ""the special,"" he says he's learned his lesson, according to Fredrick, and has a nice new cut to go with his new attitude.","A Georgia barber is giving the attention-getting haircut for free .

"Botswana may not be the first country you'd associate with head banging and shredding guitar solos, but in recent years its heavy metal scene has been making a name for itself. Back in June 2012, CNN's Inside Africa traveled to the southern African country of Botswana to meet up with some of the country's metal heads, and found the bands' powerful riffs were matched by the fans' passion -- and a penchant for the old-school metal getup of leather, studs and cowboy hats. ""Metal is a music about power, independence and freedom,"" said Giuseppe Sbrana, singer of local band Skinflint. ""That's what I believe in -- fighting for what you believe in no matter the consequences. Standing up for what you believe in and showing individuality."" South African photographer Frank Marshall captured Botswana's rockers in all their Hell's Angels-style glory as part of his ""Renegades"" series of portraits. ""Metal was seeded here [in Botswana] by a classic rock band that started in the early 70s. Since then, it's evolved and grown,"" he said. ""In the last 10 to 20 years, it's come to be visually composed of what it looks like now -- the guys dressed in leather. It started off with classic rock and later on more extreme forms of metal were introduced."" Read this: Somali rappers defy bullets, death threats . Nearly two years after that first meeting, CNN caught up with Marshall to find out how the country's fledgling metal scene is developing. ""The difference is quite extreme,"" said Marshall. ""Before then it was largely unknown and now there seems to be a lot of interest. If you look over the internet people have a lot of interest in this new form. ""The last frontier of rock and metal music is African now, is what people are saying, so they are very interested in seeing this scene grow from its, sort of, infancy and seeing where it could go."" And Marshall thinks African bands could one day bang heads with the biggest international names in stadium rock. ""I think it's just going to take hold and grow rapidly,"" he said. ""Africa will start producing very notable international rock bands and metal bands as well and probably in 10 years' time it won't be unusual to see bands from Africa headlining big stages and sharing stages with bands like Metallica. It's not beyond reason -- I'd like to see that happen."" Skinflint's Sbrana also believes that dream could be realized. ""Considering the feedback and support we have received from abroad, I would say that it is a strong possibility,"" he said. ""In fact, Africa already has metal bands which have toured Europe, and if given the chance, we will deliver."" Since Inside Africa met them in 2012, Skinflint have gone on to tour Southern Africa and Kenya -- even headlining two concerts in Sweden last year. They are now working on their fifth studio album. Sbrana says the local metal movement has gone from strength to strength in the last couple of years. ""There has been a strong interest in the African metal scene,"" he says. ""It has grown both locally and internationally.  As for the music, I would say that the band has matured and is further expanding on the African metal genre by incorporating more elements from African culture into our music.""

"Their war for freedom in Libya may be over, but almost a year after they won the battle for the Libyan capital, a group of fighters have a new battlefield: Syria. Under the command of one of Libya's most well known rebel commanders, Al-Mahdi al-Harati, more than 30 Libyan fighters have made their way into Syria to support the Free Syrian Army rebels in their war against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Al-Harati, who commanded the Tripoli Revolutionary brigade -- which was the first group of rebels to enter the Libyan capital last August -- has been in Syria for months leading some of his former men and Syrian military defectors who have joined his ""Liwaa al-Umma"" or ""The Banner of the Nation"" brigade. Recent YouTube videos show at least two different Syrian rebel factions announcing that they are part of the Liwa al-Umma. Heavy fighting in Syrian city of Aleppo . Al-Harati, who has dual Libyan and Irish citizenship, first visited Syria last year on what he calls a ""fact finding mission"" to see the situation on the ground and find out what Syrian rebels needed. ""After many Syrians approached me asking for my help, I felt it was time to do more and due to the great success of the Tripoli Brigade we felt it was time to act and that meant the formation of the Banner of the Nation,"" Al-Harati told CNN in Skype messages this week. Al-Harati said: ""With the prior success in Libya I decided to leave nationality aside and, just like world organizations helped Libya in its time of need, I decided to pass my experience to others to benefit."" In the past week, at least three more former members of the Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade traveled from the Libyan capital to join their former commander in Syria, two former members of the TRB says. Al-Harati, who describes himself as a ""commander and facilitator"" says there were no active efforts to recruit Libyans. ""These are grown men with their own minds and do not need convincing about this cause,"" Al-Harati said. Mohammed, 23, fought in some of the fiercest battles against Moammar Gadhafi's troops in Libya's Western Mountains. One year on, he dreams of fighting al-Assad's troops. He does not want his last name disclosed because he does not want his family to know he wants to go to Syria. ""What Bashar al-Assad is doing is unacceptable in Islam ... He is killing children and wiping out entire cities ... The Syrians need people to fight with them, this is Jihad, it does not have to be my (personal) cause ... As a Muslim I have to go and help them,"" he said. Mohammed smiles as he recalls the fighting in Libya last year, like now he says, it was during the Holy Month of Ramadan. Syrian rebels appear more capable, yet still outgunned . ""There is nothing better than Jihad during Ramadan ... There are some people who look at us and say we are Jihadist extremists, we are not. In Libya we experienced Jihad, tasted the beauty of Jihad. We are not going to Jihad like al-Qaeda and others. We are going to support our brothers in Syria,"" he said. Another fighter is Housam Najjair. He is 33, al-Harati's brother-in-law, and had never used a weapon until he fought in Libya last year. He said: ""When I watch TV reports ... you hear the cries of an old woman or a mother of a child who has been killed, or some of the brutal pictures that we have seen of children being killed ... I can not sit back and watch that,"" Najjair told CNN in a Skype interview from one of Turkey's borders with Syria hours before making the dangerous journey into Syria. ""I have to do whatever I can to make that journey. Because I feel guilty putting my head down at nighttime knowing that last year I was given an amazing opportunity to learn how to use weapons, for good, all for good, learn how to use weapons, how to maneuver, how to travel, how to attack, how to defend, all these things,"" Najjair said, adding that his aim is to share these experiences with Syrian rebels. During the interview, Najjair got the phone call he had been waiting for, his group of fighters is mobilizing to go into Syria. ""It is a rollercoaster of different kinds of emotions, you get excited, you get adrenalin, fear, anticipation, all these feelings come into it, fear is not the main factor and in my mind will never be ... it will impair your judgment ... Libya was a walk in the park compared to Syria, I know this going in there,"" Najjair said as he prepared to leave. Najjair says the no-fly zone enforced in Libya last year helped rebel fighters and allowed them to make great advances. Without that in Syria, operating will be much harder. He says they do not have a military base, there are makeshift barracks; they are constantly on the move and cannot spend more than a day in one location. Fighters, he says, are scattered across different areas. A Syrian town's 'Street of Death' Last month, a senior Libyan security official told CNN the government was aware of Libyans fighting in Syria, but they were individuals and not government sponsored. Earlier this year, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, accused Libya of hosting and training Syrian rebels. A claim denied by the Libyan prime minister. But Libya's government and people have been vocal in their support for the Syrian opposition. Libya was one of the first countries to recognize the opposition Syrian National Council as the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people and in February, Tripoli expelled Assad's diplomats and closed down their embassy. Many in Libya say they relate to Syrians who want to overthrow the regime. It was not too long ago that they lived a similar experience. But not everyone chooses to express support militarily. Some show solidarity by hanging the Syrian opposition flag outside their shops in Tripoli, flying alongside the Free Libya flag. In a YouTube video posted on July 4, a group of six Libyan doctors is seen being greeted by Free Syrian Army troops as they enter Syria. ""We are coming for you Bashar,"" says one of the doctors as they shake hands with the heavily armed Syrian fighters. There are no official figures on how many Libyans are currently in Syria. In February, reports of at least four Libyan fighters killed in Syria circulated, but there has been no government confirmation. For fighters like Najjair, the risk of death is a matter of faith. He said: ""You have to have faith and you have to say to yourself, ""if it's my time, I will be gone. If it's not my time it will be another amazing journey another amazing victory.""""

"(CNN)Ever wanted a Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition with even more curves? Plus-size model Robyn Lawley teamed up with Swimsuits for All last year to recreate the 2014 cover with bigger models. Now she doesn't need to invent an alternate version of the magazine. Lawley, who is a  size 12, is the first plus-size model and one of seven ""rookies"" featured in the 2015 swimsuit issue, on newsstands Tuesday. A size 12? That's still smaller than the average American woman, who wears a size 14. But in a fashion world where wearing a size 8 and standing 5' 8"" can be considered ""plus-size,"" the magazine featuring Lawley is a stitch closer to most women's reality. It's true that no one expects Sports Illustrated's annual display of skin and teeny tiny bathing suits to be a realistic portrayal of average American women. But the models are usually so, so thin. With SI rookie Lawley and other larger-than-size 2 models busting out all over, refusing to let beauty be defined by the skinny few, could it the year of the plus-size model? Lawley isn't even the only one in the magazine. Swimsuits for All, the size-inclusive swimsuit company that collaborated with Lawley last year, has an advertisement featuring plus-size model Ashley Graham in this year's swimsuit issue. Although, as Deadspin has pointed out, that means ""SI Nobly Accepts Ad Money To Put Normal-Sized Woman In Swimsuit Issue."" Fair enough. The photo isn't part of the magazine's editorial content, but really? It's not clear that ""readers"" will care. Moshe Laniado, Swimsuits for All's CEO, couldn't be more delighted with the attention his campaign is getting. ""The celebration of curves that we are witnessing right now is so important,"" said Laniado, via email. ""Tastes and body types change over time and curves have never been more 'in'."" Add to the list plus-size model Tess Holliday, who was recently signed to London-based MiLK Model Management. She got more press for effyourbeautystandards, an Instagram account she started in 2013 for women to celebrate their bodies and unique looks. Holliday is a size 22 and stands 5 feet 5 inches. ""I'm always still that 13-year-old girl in Mississippi who people told I wasn't good enough,"" she said. ""I never could have imagined that I could be here.""

"(CNN)In Australia, fishermen call them ""thumb splitters"" because of the painful blow they can inflict. In Hong Kong, they're so dangerous, that seafood restaurants store them live inside empty plastic water bottles so they can be handled. The mantis shrimp -- a sea crustacean that resembles a praying mantis -- has a set of claws that accelerate so fast when it strikes that they create air bubbles which, when they explosively collapse, also serve to stun the mantis's prey. Supersonic potential . The effect is known in physics as supercavitation and marine engineers are taking their cue from the humble mantis shrimp to create objects that, theoretically, at least, could one day travel underwater at supersonic speeds. The principle works on the fact that when an object traveling through the water is encased in bubbles, there is little to no friction or drag. Already the Russians have used supercavitation in the design of their torpedoes; the VA-111 Shkval torpedo flies through the water encased in a bubble, achieving speeds in excess of 200 knots (230 mph). For Gregory Sancoff of Juliet Marine Systems, a company that has built a fully functioning supercavitating vessel, the same principles that allow seals and penguins to shoot through the water encased in a blanket of bubbles could be used in military and civilian applications. Eliminating friction . ""Water offers 900 times more friction than air does,"" Sancoff said. In the same way that pushing your hand through swimming pool water creates bubbles by creating a high pressure area in front of it and low pressure area behind, supercavitating devices such as the Shkval torpedo work by pushing a dinner plate-sized disk at its nose through the water at high speed. This plate is then gimbaled -- that is, it pivots on an axis -- giving the device some directional control. However, Sancoff said steering in this way is still an inexact science. ""The control of pushing something through the water with a blunt face is so difficult that it's impossible to keep that object on target,"" he said. Some part of the device, he explained, needs to be in contact with dense water to give it stability and the ability to steer. Regaining control . His supercavitating vessel ""Ghost"" works by putting propellers at the front rather than the rear of the boat, effectively dragging it through the water. The 38-foot main hull travels above the water much like a hydrofoil, but the business end of the boat is contained in the 62-foot long tubes attached to the end of the struts. Equipped with gas turbine engines, the boat uses a Venturi system to funnel the expelled thrust of the propellers into the tubes to create an air bubble around the engines. ""We're actually flying through this incredibly dense foam, which is mostly air, which gives us much higher speeds,"" he said. ""It's sometimes known as microbubble supercavitation."" Decades of research . The concept is not new and scientists have been working on various designs for decades. ""Supercavitation technology goes way back with some significant research carried out in the 1950s,"" said Roger Arndt, Professor Emeritus of Civil Engineering at the University of Minnesota. ""When a hydrofoil exceeds a certain speed, cavitation can't be avoided and must be accommodated by a change in hydrofoil shape to allow operation in the supercavitation mode. ""The preliminary design of an 80-knot ship at Lockheed in 1963/64, utilized supercavitating hydrofoils as well as waterjet propulsion,"" said Arndt, who worked on the design team. Sancoff, meanwhile, has spent $15 million building the military-style vessel (which he has described as a kind of ""attack helicopter of the sea"") with the aim of securing U.S. Navy contracts. Civilian applications . Civilian interest is also growing in supercavitating vessels, not least because the boats -- which are effectively a type of submarine that bores a foam tunnel through the water -- give such a smooth ride. ""We just came back from a surface Navy show and we had serious inquiries from people who build ferries about building a high-speed ferry between Florida and Cuba now that Cuba is going to be open to the U.S. again,"" Sancoff said. ""If you cross the Gulf Stream between Florida and Cuba, you are in 15-foot seas ... Not only does Ghost supercavitate, but the way the boat's designed completely isolates all the wave motion from affecting the inside of the cockpit of the boat. ""You can be in 10-foot seas and not even feel it."" While Ghost can achieve speeds in excess of 50 knots (57mph), Sancoff said its stability is likely to be its biggest selling point. ""We're actually marketing it as a stabilized weapons platform for that one reason -- it's the only small vessel you can shoot precision weapons from,"" he said. Shipping cargo and warriors . Inquiries have also been coming in from commercial shipping companies -- an industry that loses thousands of shipping containers a year to bad weather -- about adapting the technology to create highly stable cargo ships. Offshore oil platforms, too, have been interested in a technology that can deliver oil crews quickly, safely and without seasickness. Despite this, Sancoff says the first interest for Juliet Marine is to create a military vessel that is fast enough to protect a fleet from swarm attacks and stable enough to deliver troops safely in rough seas. ""If you want to deliver those 16 Navy SEALs or Royal Marines to that beach in rough water and you want them to get out of that boat almost boot-dry, we have that platform. ""We can get the warrior to where he needs to go, fit to fight and not beaten up from the 20G impact that some of these guys are getting in high-speed boats. ""High-speed boats are really beating the heck out of these guys.""","Supercavitation is the ability to travel underwater encased in a bubble of air .

"(CNN)An Arizona prison teacher who said she was raped by an inmate is at the center of a legal controversy in which the state is accused of trying to dismiss her negligence lawsuit on the grounds of ""it's a prison, this will happen,"" her attorney contends. That claim, by attorney Scott Zwillinger, also was made Tuesday by an Arizona newspaper columnist, who criticized the Arizona Attorney  General's Office. ""The AG's reasoning is essentially this: The woman knew she was in a prison, so what did she expect?"" wrote Laurie Roberts in The Arizona Republic. ""No, seriously. That's the reasoning."" On Tuesday, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a former prosecutor, disputed those characterizations. ""Our office was disappointed to see a misleading opinion piece that was recently published regarding the brutal assault of a Department of Corrections employee that occurred in January 2014,"" a statement released by his office said. ""The Attorney General's Office is taking affirmative steps to make sure that justice is served for the victim of this heinous crime. We would ask all parties to respect the integrity of the legal process."" A federal judge on Monday heard arguments from the teacher's attorneys and the Attorney General's Office on the state's request to dismiss the teacher's lawsuit. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton rejected the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, saying the suit ""contains sufficient allegations"" against each state defendant. The judge noted the suit ""sufficiently alleges facts that plausibly suggest"" that Warden Ron Credio, Deputy Warden Edwin Lao and two supervisors ""acted with deliberate indifference to the dangerous situation in which Plaintiff was placed,"" the ruling said. The controversy focuses on statements that Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard wrote in a December 19 motion to dismiss the teacher's lawsuit against the state, the warden of the Arizona State Prison Complex -- Eyman, and other prison personnel. The instructor who said she was raped was assigned to teach in a medium-security unit that houses sex offenders and special needs prisoners, including those who are mentally ill, disabled and in need of protective custody, court papers said. The teacher is an Arizona Department of Corrections ""employee who routinely worked at the prison complex,"" Weisbard wrote. ""By being placed in a classroom at the complex, the officers were not placing Plaintiff in any type of situation that she would not normally face. The risk of harm, including assault, always existed at a prison like Eyman."" Weisbard's motion also said the teacher's suit ""does not even specifically allege that any of the individual defendants was responsible for assigning Plaintiff to utilize classroom 2 in the Meadows Unit,"" where the alleged rape occurred. The teacher has been distressed by the state's effort to dismiss her case, according to Zwillinger, her attorney. ""It's shocking, it's horrific and it increases her injuries,"" Zwillinger told CNN about the language used by the Attorney General's Office. ""For the most part her physical injuries have healed, but the emotional part of this has tore my client's life up. ""Absolutely, it's blaming the victim,"" he added. ""It feels like 1952 is what it feels like. It feels like a view of the world that I thought we got past. This is not the victim's fault. ""Prison is a bad place. I get it,"" he said. ""This is not a training corrections officer. This is a teacher, a civilian. They had a duty to protect her, and they failed in every manner."" The inmate, Jacob Harvey, now 21, is charged with rape, assault and other charges in a January 30, 2014, attack on the teacher at Eyman prison in Florence, and he has pleaded not guilty. A pretrial conference is set for February 23. Harvey was sentenced to 30 years in March 2013 as a result of a daytime home invasion in which he ""raped and savagely beat a woman in front of her young child,"" the teacher's lawsuit said. On that January 2014 morning, the teacher was administering a pre-GED High School Equivalency test to six or seven inmates, including Harvey, court papers said. The instructor wasn't trained in self-defense or how to control the movements of inmates, papers said. She couldn't use the usual instructional space -- a visitation room with big windows for guards to observe the class -- because the prison was holding an awards ceremony in the room that day, the lawsuit said. Instead, the teacher was assigned a classroom that wasn't monitored by security cameras and was in a remote location not monitored by prison guards, the suit said. The prison gave the teacher a radio to use in case an inmate ""acted up,"" the suit said. The inmates arrived to the class unescorted, the lawsuit said. After the inmates finished the test, all but Harvey left the classroom unescorted and returned to their dorms, the suit said. Harvey asked the teacher if he could use the bathroom, located outside the classroom, but after the teacher got up from her desk, Harvey grabbed her from behind, pushed her to the ground and stabbed her multiple times in the head and hands with a pen, the suit said. The teacher screamed and ""began to bleed profusely,"" but Harvey ""was stronger and he choked her and slammed her head in the floor multiple times,"" the lawsuit said. The teacher ""stopped fighting hoping to simply survive,"" and then the inmate raped her, the suit said. The instructor is seeking unspecified damages in her lawsuit against the state. In court papers, the Attorney General's Office argued that the teacher ""cannot allege facts sufficient to satisfy"" her claim that the Department of Corrections created ""the danger that allowed for her to be assaulted."" The state also argued that the teacher ""has attempted to recast absolutely routine prison events,"" court papers said. ""The problem with Plaintiff's repeated allegation in this regard is that it is impossible to conclude that such a dangerous situation would have been known and obvious to the defendants without also being known and obvious to the Plaintiff, a teacher who worked on a daily basis in the same environment as the defendants,"" the Attorney General's Office said in court papers. The instructor accused the prison and the state of negligence, false imprisonment and violation of her civil rights, court papers said. ""After being moved from the visitation room and during the approximate 1½ hours (the teacher) administered the pre-GED exam in Classroom Two, not a single corrections officer entered the classroom to perform a security check on the inmates and the welfare of (the teacher),"" the lawsuit said.

"(CNN)They don't call journalists 'hacks' for nothing. At large news agencies where speed is crucial, template-style stories have long been used for company results, allowing journalists to simply key in the relevant facts and numbers and fire off the dispatch. Often disparagingly referred to as 'churnalism,' some of the larger media organisations -- including the L.A. Times and Associated Press -- have now turned to robots to take the grind out of formulaic dispatches. The L.A. Times uses the algorithms in its in-house software -- called Quakebot - to produce reports on local earthquakes, using data provided by the US Geological Survey. The reports typically hit the newspaper's website within three minutes of the tremor being recorded. For data-rich stories such as finance stories, sports stories and breaking news where dry facts need to be collated and sent out quickly, robo-journalists are becoming increasingly common. Narrative Science, a Chicago company set up in 2010 to commercialize technology developed at Northwestern University that crunches data into a narrative, markets its Quill software to television stations and to financial houses that generate earnings statements. ""A lot of people felt threatened by what we were doing, and we got a lot of coverage,"" Narrative Science CEO Stuart Frankel told MIT Technology Review. ""It led to a lot of inquiries from all different industries and to the evolution to a different business."" Read this: Will nanotechnology soon allow you to 'swallow the doctor?' Its algorithms now write up lengthy reports on the performance of mutual funds for the consumption of investors and regulators. ""It goes from the job of a small army of people over weeks to just a few seconds,"" Frankel said. ""We do 10- to 15-page documents for some financial clients."" While the prose can seem stilted, chief scientist at the company Kris Hammond says the algorithm is growing in complexity. ""We know how to introduce an idea, how not to repeat ourselves, how to get shorter,"" he said. Writing in the nuances can simply be a matter of setting the software's parameters: a devastating loss for a sports team can be written in a sympathetic style for the team's home audience while regulatory filings can be as exhaustive and granular as required for the client. Known as 'natural language generation', the company -- which does not reveal exactly how its software operates - is tapping into years of research into how software can write in language that responds not just to the data but its context and its relevance. Hammond, meanwhile, believes it is only a matter of time before a robo-journalist will write a Pulitzer Prize winning story as the software grows in sophistication. He said there is no reason for the algorithms to move from commodity news, to narrative journalism to complex long-form features. Asked whether a computer would win a Pulitzer Prize within 20 years, he disagreed saying it would happen within five years. ""Humans are unbelievably rich and complex, but they are machines,"" Hammond told Wired. ""In 20 years, there will be no area in which Narrative Science doesn't write stories."" While media organizations that use bots to crunch data say the software is merely an adjunct to the journalist's work, and will  never replace them, some commentators believe that mapping the way forward for artificial intelligence will be one of the most urgent tasks of the 21st century. Professor Yuval Harari, Israeli historian and author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, believes it is not just journalism that is being challenged by machines. ""The conscious experiences of a flesh-and-blood taxi driver are infinitely richer than those of Google's self-driving car, which feels nothing,"" Harari told CNN. ""But what the system needs from a taxi driver is to bring passengers from point A to point B as quickly, safely and cheaply as possible. ""Google's self-driving car will soon be able to do that far better than a human driver. The same goes for mechanics, lawyers, soldiers, doctors, teachers -- and even computer engineers."" Read this: In a hurry? Let a robot valet park your car . He said that while machines may have replaced humans for the past 200 years since the Industrial Revolution, there has always been something that humans could do better than machines. However, he said that this gap is likely to close over the next 100 years. ""(Since the Industrial Revolution) humans have focused more on performing cognitive tasks. But what will happen once computerized algorithms can outperform humans in that (area) too? Some believe that artificial intelligence should be viewed as a threat to the human race. Oxford philosopher and transhumanist Nick Bostrom is convinced that humanity will end up being ""the biological boot loader for superintelligent AI"". Elon Musk, the superstar entrepreneur who founded PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla Motors, echoed this warning via his Twitter feed: . ""The idea that humans will always have a unique ability beyond the reach of non-conscious algorithms is just wishful thinking. It is based on the traditional assumption that intelligence and consciousness are inextricably linked to one another. For millions of years of evolution, this may have been true. But no longer,"" says Harari. Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: . Digital nose on a chip can sniff out cancer . Meet the world's first 1,000 mph car . Out of juice?

"The drive from Tallinn to Auvere in North-Eastern Estonia was long and dark. The winter sun had yet to rise and we saw little of the outside world from our misty car windows. But as we arrived at Narva, Estonia's border with Russia, a picture began to form of the economic strength of this region. In front of us, swaths of land were being bitten into and scooped up by colossal Soviet diggers. That's because underneath this grey-brown land is a soft-brown sedimentary rock that is rich in oil.

They have been squeezing rocks here for a century and, now that they're making money, companies such as Eesti Energia are investing heavily on new plants, Liive told me. ""Commercial utilization of oil shale started nearly 100 years ago. Estonia got our independence in 1918 and actually Estonia independence is very much close links with the oil shale industry, because in 1924 we already had oil plants in operation, and even gasoline was produced,"" he said. ""As you can see from here, during last three years, we have invested one billion euros here. So this is not only 100 years of history but this is actually modernization and continuous development of technology and new investments."" Read more: Spain's booming Rioja economy . During our visit here, one of their proudest achievements -- the Enefit 280 oil shale plant, which will double output of kerogen oil -- was already taking shape. But talk of new plants, more open-cast pits and more shifting of land makes environmentalist cringe. Valdur Lahtvee is one of those calling for Estonia to ditch this primitive way of mining, arguing that there are enough renewable resources in the country to have 100% power supply based on renewables. Watch more: Maastricht: The birthplace of the euro . He should know -- he used to work at Eesti Energia. Now, he's the Director of Climate and Energy Programme at Stockholm's Environment Institute. ""Oil shale is the dirtiest fuel used today in European Union. The external cost of the oil shale power is 18 euro cents, coal is about is 10 cents per kw hour, wind is 0.4 euro cents  -- that gives you a picture of the ecological footprint of the oil shale used,"" he told me. Watch more: A history of defaulting on debt . ""Oil shale industry contributes approximately 4% of Estonia's GDP, but, at the same time, total national emissions it provides 90% of the hazardous waste, about 80% of the major air emissions and 70/80% of the water used. So, it has a really huge impact to the environment."" It's a charge that I put to Eesti Energia's CEO who counter-argued by telling me that for the land they shift is replanted with trees. One thing is very clear, the environmental impact is very predictable. Off course, we mine, we have some mining impact -- we move the land, but we put it back and we plant a lot of trees. I think in [the] energy business anyway, and in any industry, [there is] an environmental impact, even in the wind turbine has an environmental impact."" He continued: ""Yes, they don't emit Co2 in the place where you produce electricity but you know a lot of environmental impact has been done getting metals, transporting it and building it. I think it's very important in the oil shale case that you know what you get, you know that this environmental impact is very predictable."" Read more: Bumpy road ahead for London cabbie business . The problem is Estonia won't want to let go of its oil shale dependence, because it's competitive. It's cheaper than Russian gas, onshore and offshore wind. On top of that, it would cost companies too much to change their Soviet infrastructure. And then there is political pressure, Lahtvee told me. ""There is biomass, there is a nice wind condition, we are a coastal country, by the Baltic sea so there is a lot of  wind. But mainly the question is we have inherited these power production systems, these power plants; it's much more costly to replace."" Lahtvee pointed to political pressure, too.  ""Elections are every four years, and the voters will ask what will happen with their electricity or their energy costs. Politicians always try to answer that ""we keep the power prices down."" Therefore, the system stays without major changes."" But these advantages may not last. Estonia's oil shale gamble assumes that oil prices will remain high, and that the price they pay the European Union for carbon emissions remains low. This may be the case (carbon is hovering around four euros a tonne). But some in the European parliament are calling for prices to be pushed back up as much as fifty euros a tonne, a price that could be damaging for a business like this one which has built itself mostly on shale. While Liive may be worried about oil prices and emission costs, he tells me it's not enough to make him lose sleep. So, for the time being, Eesti Energia is powering on. Its international arm Enefit is betting on shale selling beyond its borders, with a plant in Jordan and recently bought land in the U.S. state of Utah. A risky strategy. But if shale does stay strong, Estonia could win big.","Estonia is using oil shale to generate energy. Oil shale is found in rocks just 30 metres underground .
Oil shale industry contributes approximately 4% of Estonia's GDP. 90% of the power produced in Estonia is made of oil shale.

"(CNN)Before Ronald Read died last summer, he was, on several occasions, the recipient of another person's generosity. One woman, worried that the same tattered baseball cap he often wore wouldn't be enough to keep him warm in the Vermont winter, knitted him a hat, Read's attorney Laurie Rowell told CNN. His khaki denim jacket was held together with a safety pin and his flannel shirt was so old, someone once paid for his breakfast at Friendly's. ""The man ahead of him had paid for him,"" Rowell said, ""Based on what he looked like and how he dressed."" Perhaps that's why the man known for his extreme frugality and scruffy appearance decided in the years before his death that he'd do a little giving of his own. ""The estate of Robert Read made its first distributions to Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and the Brooks Library in the amounts of $4.8 million and $1.2 million,"" Read's attorney said in a press release. Read frequented the coffee shop at the hospital for breakfast, Gina Pattison, with Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, told CNN affiliate WCAX. Pattison called Read ""a very unassuming man."" ""To find out that he had left this money to the hospital was a great surprise,"" Pattison said. The president of the Board of Trustees for the Brooks Memorial Library said in a release he was delighted by the news and said Read's donation was the largest bequest since that of George J. Brooks in 1886. Read was in the Army during World War II before working as a mechanic with his brother for many years.  After the garage was sold, Read could have taken some time to relax, but ""he didn't take to retirement very well,"" Rowell said. Read eventually went to work as a part-time janitor at J.C. Penney.  He finally retired in 1997. Though his jobs never yielded large salaries, Read enjoyed investing in the stock market, always putting his money into ""dividend producing stocks,"" Rowell said. He lived modestly, hating to spend money or see anything go to waste, a release from Rowell's law firm said. ""He wouldn't even park close to my office because he didn't want to pay for parking,"" she said. When her client died last June and she went to retrieve the appropriate estate documents from Read's safety deposit box, she realized just how frugal he was. ""The box was completely packed tight with stock certificates,"" she said. When the banker hit the final total, they all stood in shock: Read was worth more than $8 million. Besides his frugality, Rowell described Read as a quintessential ""Vermonter."" He was softspoken, but had a great sense of humor.  He was also a very private man. ""He'd be shocked to have this much exposure,"" Rowell said. In addition to his charitable donations, Read also gave a portion of his fortune to a couple of stepchildren and friends.","Man known for extreme frugality makes generous donations to local hospital, library.

"(CNN)The tail section of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 was lifted from the Java Sea on Saturday, but the plane's cockpit voice and flight recorders, or ""black boxes,"" were not found. Indonesian officials said the devices were not with the recovered section. The plane's black boxes will likely be found in ""a few days,"" the crash's chief investigator said, after searchers were able to hear more pings, even if they haven't yet pinpointed where they came from. The investigator, Mardjono Siswosuwarno, told CNN that smaller boats picked up several pings emanating near where the commercial jet's tail was found. ""I think we will be able to find the black boxes in a few days, because the location where pings were detected is not very far from the tail,"" Siswosuwarno said. On Sunday, one of the search ships detected two ping signals 1.5 miles away from where the tail was found, according to an Indonesian technical assessment agency. Siswosuwano told CNN that several pings were detected emitting a frequency of 37.5 MHZ, leading search team to believe they are getting closer to finding at least one of the black boxes. ""The interval and frequency are right. The sound is very clear, the typical sound of black box ping."" The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were housed in the Airbus A320-200's tail. The data recorder provides a wide range of information about what the plane was doing, from its air speed to the position of the landing gear, said Greg Waldron, the managing editor of Flightglobal, an aviation industry website. The cockpit voice recorder captures communications between the pilots. Batteries that send out the pings last 30 days -- it has been 15 days since the jet fell into the Java Sea. The aircraft went down on December 28 with 162 people on board while heading to Singapore from Surabaya, Indonesia. The plane's pilot had asked to change course and climb to a higher altitude minutes before contact was lost, Indonesian officials said. Divers, helicopters and vessels are checking the area where the pings suspected to be from the flight recorders have been detected. Sonar equipments also detected objects that could be the front part of the plane, according to an AirAsia update. Tony Fernandes, the airline's CEO, tweeted that he had heard promising news that the black box may be found soon, but also expressed wanting to find the fuselage. The fuselage is where many of the bodies of those onboard could be found. Officials also said search ships detected a large object underwater, about 30 feet long, close to the possible pings -- raising hopes that major wreckage could soon be found. But there is also caution as there are all kinds of debris in the sea. A total of 48 bodies have been recovered so far, according to Indonesia's search and rescue agency. The vast majority of the people on AirAsia QZ8501 were Indonesian. There were also citizens of Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea.

"(CNN)A sign you'd expect to see in a war zone, hanging at a police station. Two unarmed civilians shot more than 20 times after a high-speed chase. A man in the middle of a medical emergency, jolted with a Taser while strapped to a gurney. These are alarming examples, federal investigators say, that show police in Cleveland have been using unnecessary and unreasonable force at a ""significant rate,"" employing ""dangerous tactics"" that put the community at risk. A report released Thursday details a nearly two-year Justice Department investigation which found that Cleveland police use guns, Tasers, pepper spray and their fists excessively, unnecessarily or in retaliation. Officers also have used excessive force on those ""who are mentally ill or in crisis,"" the Justice Department said. Now a federal court will keep tabs on the Cleveland police as part of a legal agreement going forward. The Justice Department's investigation started in 2013, after several incidents, including a controversial case the previous year when more than 100 officers were involved in a high-speed chase that ended with the deaths of two unarmed civilians. Here's a look at that case, and several others examples federal investigators pointed out in their report: . A chase gone awry: Police began chasing Timothy Russell and passenger Malissa Williams after officers and witnesses thought they heard a gunshot coming from their car as they drove by a court building. But it turns out, they didn't have weapons. The Justice Department's report said it now appears that what they heard was the car backfiring. More than 100 officers participated in the high-speed chase. After a 25-minute chase that reached speeds of more than 100 mph and ended in a school parking lot, 13 officers fired 137 rounds hitting Russell and Williams more than 20 times each, the report said. ""The officers, who were firing on the car from all sides, reported believing that they were being fired at by the suspects. It now appears that those shots were being fired by fellow officers,"" the Justice Department wrote. Both Williams and Russell were killed. Suspect kicked in the head: Video from a police helicopter captured officers arresting a man after a January 2011 police chase. After the suspect was handcuffed and lying on the ground, officers used excessive force by kicking him in the head numerous times, the report said. Many officers were there, but none identified any fellow officers who had exacted excessive force on the suspect, and no officer was disciplined, the Justice Department said. Accountability, or the lack thereof, was a theme of the Justice Department report. Of the period reviewed, 2010-2013, the investigation found that officers were suspended on only six occasions for improper use of force. ""Discipline is so rare that no more than 51 officers out of a sworn force of 1,500 were disciplined in any fashion in connection with a use of force incident over a three-and-a half-year period,"" the report said. Taser used inside ambulance: Officers were flagged down to help a man lying on a sidewalk having seizures. When paramedics arrived, they helped him into an ambulance, where he was strapped onto a gurney. That's when the man, who the Justice Department reports identifies as ""Mark,"" got angry, threatening the officer and trying unsuccessfully to stand up. ""Mark continued to try to stand up while threatening to beat the officer. The officer then drive stunned Mark on his top left shoulder. Mark had committed no crime, was strapped down and was in the midst of a medical crisis,"" the Justice Department report says. ""His repeated seizures may also have left him confused and disoriented. Indeed, there is no indication that Mark could carry out his threat against the officers, particularly when he was strapped to the gurney."" 13-year-old punched: After a handcuffed 13-year-old arrested for shoplifting began to kick a police car's door and kicked an officer in the leg, the 300-pound police officer sat on the boy's legs and punched him in the face until he had a bloody nose. The 13-year-old ""was pushing against the officer with his legs, but was handcuffed and posed no threat to the officer,"" the Justice Department's report says, noting that Cleveland police have used excessive force on people who are handcuffed or subdued and ""pose little or no threat to officers."" Sign of the times: Above a vehicle bay at one of the Cleveland Division of Police's district stations hangs a sign that reads, ""forward operating base,"" a term usually used to describe an area of tactical operations in a war zone. The sign sends a message indicative of the community's opinion of the division, Justice Department officials said. ""This characterization reinforces the view held by some -- both inside and outside the Division -- that CDP is an occupying force instead of a true partner and resource in the community it serves,"" the investigative report said. It's one illustration, the Justice Department's report says, that ""officer training instills in officers an 'us-against-them' mentality."" Issues resonate beyond Cleveland . The results of the federal review come as the Cleveland Division of Police is under fire for the November fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. The incident sparked even more outrage amid high tensions over Michael Brown's shooting death in Missouri and similar situations that have put police use of force under a microscope. Cleveland police Chief Calvin Williams has defended Rice's shooting, saying he reached for an air pistol that was ""indistinguishable from a real firearm."" While Thursday's announcement was set in Cleveland, Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that the problems it highlights aren't contained by city limits. ""As President Obama and I have indicated, the time has come, we think, to do even more. The tragic losses of these and far too many other Americans, including just last month, the shooting death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice here in Cleveland, have really raised urgent national questions,"" Holder said Thursday. ""And they have sparked an important conversation about the sense of trust that must exist between law enforcement and the communities that they serve and protect."" What's next? Authorities say Cleveland police need better training and more accountability going forward. ""Deeply troubling to us was that some of the specially trained investigators who are charged with conducting unbiased reviews of officers' use of deadly force admitted to us that they conduct their investigations with the goal of casting the accused officer in the most positive light possible,"" the Justice Department's report said. The department fails to review its officers' use of force, investigate other allegations of misconduct, ""respond to patterns of at-risk behavior,"" enforce appropriate policies and establish ""effective community policing strategies,"" according to the Justice Department. ""Throughout the investigation, the Department of Justice provided its observations and concerns to the city, and in response, the division has begun to implement a number of remedial measures, however, much more work is needed,"" the department's statement said. As a result of the findings, the city and Justice Department have signed an agreement ""to develop a court-enforceable consent decree that will include a requirement for an independent monitor who will oversee and ensure necessary reforms."" Holder, Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta and U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach met Thursday with community leaders, law enforcement officials and elected officials to discuss how to improve that relationship. ""Together, we can build confidence in the division that will ensure compliance with the Constitution, improve public safety and make the job of delivering police services safer and more effective,"" Gupta said in a statement. Williams told reporters his officers are committed to improving the department. ""We will work to make this police department better,"" he said. ""I have confidence we will.""","Guns, Tasers, fists, chemical sprays are all used inappropriately, probe finds .

"(CNN)The NBC anchor issued an abject apology in his ""Nightly News"" program Wednesday, admitting he'd falsely claimed to have been in a Chinook helicopter shot down over Iraq 12 years go. He wrote on the NBC Nightly News Facebook page that he'd spent some time wondering if he'd ""gone crazy,"" but ultimately decided he'd conflated events in his memory. Others aren't so quick to agree with him. Critics are piling on and hoping to put the newsman's essential credibility in question. That's a currency without which he can't do his job. Some are drawings comparisons to the reporting controversy that brought down the veteran CBS anchor Dan Rather. Like any good controversy, the affair has already launched a few social media hashtags, including #BrianWilliamsMisremembers, which pillories Williams by placing him at the center of world events in which he had no part. While no one can rule out Williams and NBC set out in a craven and intentional attempt to misappropriate valor from a dramatic wartime scenario, or even a well-intentioned white lie (Williams was trying to honor an involved soldier during his most recent retelling), it's also possible he's suffered an all-too-natural memory error. How Brian Williams' Iraq story changed . Doctors like myself who grapple with memory impairments in our patients won't issue a diagnosis on the basis of a single memory lapse or false memory, no matter how major. Admittedly, this one was earthquake-generating, but the dramatic nature and outsized impact of this error don't make it a sign of disease, not without more frequent spells or other symptoms. We don't call single false memories like this a disease because they're in fact normal, right alongside your occasionally forgotten car keys, your missing wallet or even your misremembered conversation. Brian Williams has experienced a very public symptom of life, and we should all forgive him for that. Let he who has never lost his keys cast the first tomato. You may wonder how it's possible that Williams tricked himself into such a vivid false memory told in such detail. He did experience some aspects of the events. Though he wasn't in the Chinook that took a hit, he landed in that forward position with it. He formed bonds with the servicemen around him. He felt vulnerability and stress during that period. Williams has told his story many times before, and each time he tells it, he is retrieving it. Errors happen during memory retrieval all the time, just as errors happen in cell division; biology isn't computer science. Furthermore, he is subtly modifying his memory with his every retelling. Revisions occur as the memory is re-encoded based on what's going on at the time he tells the story. Circumstances like a gabby, friendly free-wheeling interview with David Letterman. The emotions he's feeling when he's retelling the story also infect the original memory. The NBC videos of the downed Chinook that he's viewed repeatedly are dredged up as well. Clever studies tell us just how powerfully words and images can manipulate memory to the point of inserting false memories. In one, researchers interviewed the parents of their experimental subjects, all college students, and collected true stories about events each of the studies had experienced. After presenting these true stories mixed with false ones, researchers were able to trick 25% of the perfectly healthy students into thinking they had experienced one of the false stories just by having had them imagine any connections they might have to what they couldn't remember.  Brian Williams had plenty of connection to the downed helicopter. In another study demonstrating the disturbing ease with which the human mind can create a false memory, researchers doctored a photograph to show adult subjects as children in a hot air balloon, and 50% of the adults ultimately believed they really took the balloon ride. Mr. Williams has been saturated in photos and video of the downed Chinook for many years now. In the annals of famous false memories, this one has eclipsed Neil deGrasse Tyson's notoriously erroneous stock line criticizing part of a George W. Bush speech that the former President never uttered.There's no doubt Brian Williams has made a serious journalistic error for which he must atone. At the same time we should show him some sympathy for an embarrassing bug in the mental hardware all humans share.","Ford Vox: Brian Williams' is being slammed for false Iraq claim, but false memories are not uncommon .

"(CNN)On an early February morning almost 25 years ago, a bleeding 12-year-old Melissa Repass somehow summoned the courage and wherewithal to call 911 after she and six others were shot execution-style at a New Mexico bowling alley. Repass and 13-year-old Amy Hauser had arrived at the Las Cruces Bowl early that day to work at the bowling alley's day care. As Repass' mother dropped her off, two armed men took Hauser, Repass and her mother to a back room where the safe was located. The bowling alley's cook was also forced into the room. Shortly afterward, another employee -- Steven Teran, 26 -- and his two young daughters arrived at the bowling alley and were confronted by one of the suspects, who pushed them into the room with the others, police said. There, the armed men were able to get into the safe and took the $5,000 in cash inside. After stashing the money, the men shot all seven victims at point-blank range and set fire to the office, apparently hoping to destroy evidence, police said. Then, they fled. Repass, who was critically injured, managed to find a phone and dial 911. Police arrived shortly thereafter to find all seven victims in the office as the fire continued to grow. Repass, her mother and the cook were the only ones who survived. As the 25th anniversary of the brutal murders comes on February 10, the suspects still have not been brought to justice. Las Cruces police investigators updated sketches of the men back in 2005 to reflect 15 years of aging, but still haven't had any significant leads. Police Chief Jaime Montoya said his officers still ""aggressively follow new leads as they come in"" but they're continuing to ask for the public's help in finding the men. ""It's amazing that even 25 years later, we still receive tips. Usually around the anniversary of the event, they come in, and as they come in we actively pursue them,"" Det. Amador Martinez told CNN. Today, the older suspect would be in his late 50s or early 60s, authorities say. The younger man  would be in his late 40s or in his early 50s. Police say they believe both men are Hispanic with dark complexions. ""It remains our intention to solve this case for the sake of the victims, their families and friends, and all the residents of Las Cruces who continue to mourn the senseless tragedy that shook our city,""  Montoya said in a statement. CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this story.","Police hope 25th anniversary of gruesome Las Cruces murders brings new information .

"(CNN)As a proud Army mother, Kelly Copeland cannot bear to see ""American Sniper,"" even though it now rates as the biggest grossing war movie of all time. Her son, Brandon Smith, told her that his life mirrored the movie. ""I can't bring myself to watch it,"" Copeland said. Smith was only 20 when he was assigned to the sniper section of a mortar platoon at the height of the Iraq war. When I met him there in early 2008, he told me he was well-suited for his mission. He grew up hunting in Georgia and was used to waiting for his prey. Not every soldier has that kind of patience. Not every soldier can become a sniper. Smith already had his first confirmed kill when we met. He was hungry for another one. And he got more, though he wouldn't tell me how many when I caught up with him this week after I saw the movie. ""I really don't want to talk about that,"" he said. But what he did say was that just like Chris Kyle, the central character of ""American Sniper,"" he felt he was doing the right thing. ""I enjoyed being on a roof, knowing that any moment now, this could be it.  I enjoyed the thrill of getting a shot out. I liked killing the enemy."" The Oscar-nominated blockbuster biopic, which tells the story of the most lethal sniper in U.S. history, has fueled intense debate over the film's message. Is it anti-war or not? Is Kyle a hero or a psychopath? Those questions -- and interest in the movie -- may only intensify as the soldier accused of killing Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield goes to trial in the coming days. Jury selection in the case of former Marine Eddie Ray Routh was scheduled to begin Thursday in Stephenville, Texas. It's expected that mental health will be key -- Kyle and Littlefield were helping Routh with rehabilitation at a rifle range when Routh gunned them down two years ago. I've met sharpshooters who relished the moment of a kill. Some liked the adrenaline and the satisfaction of vanquishing a foe. Others were drawn to the stark simplicity of a life-and-death moment -- when nothing else seemed important. No matter the perspective, I've heard a couple of constant themes from soldiers. ""American Sniper,"" they say, is a must-see for anyone who wants to understand the American experience in Iraq. Still, for those who fought in uniform, especially sharpshooters, it can be difficult to watch. Smith mentioned a scene toward the end of the movie in which Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper, adjusts his scope and targets an Iraqi sniper as a dust storm clouds the air. This is supposed to be Kyle's legendary longest shot at 2,100 yards away. The first time Smith killed, he did the same from a rooftop in restive Arab Jabour, southeast of Baghdad. He scoured the area with high-powered opticals known as the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System. There was no dust storm, but it was early in the morning and hard to focus through dense fog. Smith spotted a man trying to hide from helicopters overhead. He saw him pick up an object, put it over his shoulder and attempt to cover it with a blanket. Smith thought it might be a shaped-charge explosive that can pierce armored vehicles. ""I remember it to this day, like I was still sitting there,"" he said. He heard the command, ""engage,"" and opened fire with his .50-caliber rifle -- two rounds through the trees, two more on either side. His shot was 1,243 yards. He anticipated he would be upset by his first kill. He wasn't. ""I wasn't nervous or anything. I didn't feel nothing,"" he later told Darren Turner, the battalion chaplain who counseled Smith in Iraq and who I followed for many weeks for a series about a man of God in a place of war. Even then, I heard Smith speak lines that Kyle echoes in ""American Sniper"": Their kills saved American lives, and that's what mattered. Only 2% of men are not loath to kill, wrote Dave Grossman in his landmark book ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society."" Chaplain Turner thought Smith might be one of them, though he worried how it would affect the young soldier later on. Smith still believes he, like Kyle, is one of the 2%. ""When you are bred to kill, you know. You just know,"" he said. Smith is a civilian now; he repairs substations for an electrical company.  He is 6 years older and has a wife and two little children. But he sounds far less sure of himself than when I first saw him wearing a sweat-drenched patrol cap and nursing the Copenhagen Long Cut stuffed in his jaw. He returned home from Iraq and rode his motorbike at crazy speeds on the highway. He took a fancy to bull riding. He did another tour in 2009 and admits that he has become an angry person. ""I go from zero to 90 real quick,"" he told me. He tried to beat up his dog once, just like Kyle does in the movie. On his first tour, he was troubled by the howls of a woman and her two daughters after Smith's team killed her husband. He thought then about how his own mother and two brothers would react to his death. The opening scene of the movie, when Kyle takes aim at a woman and child, took Smith back to that day. He told me that when he closes his eyes every night, he sees faces, hears screams. ""Everyone thinks I'm crazy,"" he said. ""I'm just trying to fit in."" I asked him the same question his counselor did: ""Do you have any regrets?"" ""That's not me,"" Smith replied. That's not Louis Bravo or any of the other snipers I have spoken with either. Bravo, who now works as an Army recruiter, enjoyed watching ""American Sniper"" and said that for some reason, he ""welcomed the memories."" He said he never struggled with what he saw and did at war, but the film's homefront scenes resonated. Bravo also was only 20 when he did his first tour of Iraq. He returned to America to no one, as he put it. He completed sniper training at elite institutions and twice competed in the International Sniper Competition. He was a sniper team leader in Afghanistan. ""Being a sniper is in fact different than just being infantry,"" Bravo told me. ""It's an added stressor as everyone expects more from you. Or that every sniper should be able to perform at Hollywood level because they saw Mark Wahlberg in 'Shooter.' "" And now, Cooper in ""American Sniper."" For snipers, it's always about watching and waiting on a target. And watching and waiting some more.  But after a while, Bravo said, it felt like any other job. It was the months after his second tour that became a problem for Bravo.  On that return, he had a wife and child waiting for him at home. There are scenes in ""American Sniper"" that played out at Bravo's home, lines that were spoken verbatim. About Bravo's absence, his distance, changes in his demeanor. ""What's hard to grasp is that nothing is the same. ... You, your spouse, kids, house, bills, schools, job, interaction skills, emotions are all tainted and jumbled up in what's left of your brain,"" Bravo said. At one point in the movie, Kyle is back home sitting in front of a television set staring at what sounds like a battlefield. ""Why is he watching that stuff?"" Bravo's wife asked him as they viewed the movie together. ""He's not,"" he told his wife. And, sure enough, Bravo had called the scene correctly -- before the camera turns to show a blank TV screen and the audience realizes that the noises are inside Kyle's head. Bravo, now 30, has had those moments. ""I zoned out thinking of a terrible mission I was on."" Bravo was lucky. It took eight months of nightmares, marriage counseling and a close call on divorce, but he managed to snap out of his post-war haze. ""I'm glad I have my husband back,"" his wife told him. ""When she said it, I kind of looked at her funny. I didn't feel any different. I didn't claim PTSD,"" Bravo said. ""But if you ask my wife, I was a train wreck for eight months."" Bravo said he didn't know how many kills he had. Kyle, he said, was a brilliant marksman, but he also happened to be in all of the hot spots in Iraq. He faced Sunni insurgents in Falluja and Shiite militants in Sadr City. The places where Kyle went, said Bravo, every Iraqi was the enemy. ""Critics are twisting it and saying that we thought of them all as savages,"" he said. In Kyle's autobiography, on which the movie is based, he wrote that he loved being a Navy SEAL. ""I only wish I had killed more,"" he wrote. ""I loved what I did. I still do. If circumstances were different -- if my family didn't need me -- I'd be back in a heartbeat."" I've heard that before from soldiers I met in Iraq. I heard it again this week from Smith. He said ""American Sniper"" made him miss the battlefield even more. ""I was proud of what I did there,"" he said. ""Now that I am out, I feel like a nobody."" His mother understands her son is having a difficult time. She just wants back the mama's boy who made her laugh. ""I love him with everything I have,"" she said. ""I miss my son."" She thought she knew the boy she raised until the day he became a sniper.","Brandon Smith believes he is well-suited to be a sniper .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) A senior cleric for al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen was killed along with three other people in a drone strike on their vehicle January 31 in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said Thursday. The cleric, Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari, was killed in Yemen's south-central Shabwa province, AQAP said. The strike would be a further indication that a U.S.-led drone strike program is continuing following a pause during political upheaval in the majority Sunni Muslim nation. The United States has long conducted drone strikes against AQAP targets under the Obama administration. But the New America Foundation, which tracks the strikes, says there was a nearly two-month pause in the strikes in late 2014 and early 2015 as Shiite Muslim Houthi rebels moved against Yemen's U.S.-backed government. That uprising culminated in the resignation of Yemeni government's top leaders in mid-January. A week later, the U.S. drone strikes resumed, with a strike east of the capital, Sanaa, three U.S. officials said at the time. Al-Nadhari made headlines in November when he inserted himself into a rivalry between al Qaeda and ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ISIS has captured parts of Syria and Iraq for what it calls its Islamic caliphate. In mid-November, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi issued an audiotape saying his Islamic State had expanded to Yemen and other Middle Eastern countries. Al-Nadhari responded harshly in a video a week later, saying al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate was illegitimate. ""Our brothers in the Islamic State ... surprised us with several steps, including their announcement of the caliphate (and) they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries which they have have no governance, and considered them to be provinces that belonged to them,"" al-Nadhari said, according to a translation by the SITE intelligence group. ""The announcement of the caliphate for all Muslims by our brothers in the Islamic State did not meet the required conditions,"" al-Nashari argued, because other jihadi groups were not consulted. Al-Nadhari also criticized ISIS for ""going too far in interpretations in terms of spilling inviolable blood under the excuse of expanding and spreading the power of the Islamic State."" ISIS and al Qaeda's top leadership in Pakistan had a bitter falling out in 2014, and al Qaeda and ISIS fighters have been fighting each other in Syria, but AQAP until November had stayed above the fray, calling for both sides to reconcile and pool resources to strike the United States. Houthi militants dressed in government uniforms raided the main office of Yemen's daily Akhbar Al Youm newspaper Thursday, according to two officials in the Yemen Journalists Syndicate, an organization for reporters in the country. Eyewitnesses said the attackers damaged some equipment and forcefully locked some journalists inside a guard room at the office. Details about how long the journalists allegedly were detained weren't immediately available. Akhabar Al Youm is one of the oldest independent publications in Yemen, with print houses in Sanaa and Aden. Houthi officials did not confirm that Houthis were involved in Thursday's raid. However, Ahmed Al Bahri, a legal adviser for the Houthis, said the newspaper had ""always been anti-Houthi"" and is funded by those who oppose the minority group. ""Many lies against the Houthis are published, which in return damages our reputation, and with no government censorship over its reporting,"" Al Bahri said. CNN's Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa. CNN's Jason Hanna and Margot Haddad reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari was senior cleric for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .

"(CNN)Parents at a Chicago-area day care center are keeping a close watch over their children for any signs of fever or rashes. They learned  Wednesday that two infants who attend a KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine, Illinois, have tested positive for measles. Three more cases have been diagnosed, based on clinical and other criteria, but results are pending, according to a statement from the Cook County Department of Public Health and state officials. Officials say it is not clear whether these cases are linked to a previously confirmed case in suburban Cook County or to the outbreak associated with Disneyland in California. In light of the ongoing debate over childhood vaccinations, agencies are taking extra precautions to limit the spread  of the measles. Everyone at the day care center was notified about the measles cases.  Anyone who has not had the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine was told to stay at home and away from others who have not  been vaccinated for the next 21 days. Infected people are contagious from four days before their rash begins through four days afterward. KinderCare issued a statement, saying it is focused on ensuring the continued health and safety of everyone at the center. In addition to banning children and staff who have not been vaccinated and may have been exposed to the measles until February, 24, KinderCare says the Palatine center also received a deep cleaning. Officials promised to closely monitor the situation and to keep families informed. The two infants confirmed to have measles have not been vaccinated.  Amy Poore-Terrell, spokeswoman for the public health department, says the children were too young to be vaccinated. The MMR vaccine is generally not given to children under the age of 1. Officials are advising anyone who experiences a high fever and  rash to call their local health department and their doctor, even though the cases appear to be concentrated in the northwest suburban Cook County region. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash.  It can cause deadly health complications including pneumonia and encephalitis. Measles is  spread by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing. It can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.","Two cases of measles confirmed at Chicago-area day care center .

"(CNN)An 8-foot spirit rock outside a South Carolina high school has a bright, new message of solidarity after students replaced a racist message left by a vandal. Less than a week after a judge in Rock Hill righted a wrong of the Jim Crow era, someone used  white spray paint to scrawl ""Happy N***er Month KKK"" on the rock outside the city's South Pointe High School, an apparent reference to the start of Black History Month. The crime likely happened overnight Saturday. A school employee noticed the vandalism Sunday, according to a police incident report, and a maintenance worker quickly painted over the graffiti. Art students at the school then grabbed brushes and cans of paint to make a point. By Monday, three students had painted the Earth over a rainbow backdrop with yellow handprints and the words ""WE ARE ALL"" and a large equal sign on the rock. ""I wanted the students to stop texting and tweeting and blogging that image,"" said visual arts teacher Ashley Beard. ""We wanted to replace it with something positive."" Rock Hill police officers reviewed school surveillance video but it was so ""dark and grainy,"" they were not able to identify any potential suspects in the vandalism, Capt. Mark Bollinger said. ""While the district is disappointed in the actions of those who painted the rock, we will not let them take from us our joy or success in the progress our community has made, and will continue to make, in racial relations,"" according to a statement posted on the Rock Hill School District's Facebook page. Just days earlier, the Rock Hill community honored members of the Friendship Nine, who led a protest during the civil rights era. A judge erased their convictions, related to a 1961 sit-in at a segregated lunch counter. Judge tosses 'Friendship Nine' convictions . The men were convicted of trespassing and ordered to pay a $100 fine or spend 30 days at a work camp. ""Kids all over the country were going to school -- demonstrating in the afternoon, after school, in the mornings, and then being arrested, then paying the fine and we weren't making any progress,"" Friendship Nine member Clarence Graham told CNN. All but one of the students from Friendship College opted for the jail time. ""So 'jail, no bail' gave us an opportunity to be arrested, spend the 30 days in jail without paying the money.  In so doing, it would help keep the money in our treasury and not swell the treasury of the city and the county,"" Graham said. ""After that, it caught on. By summer, you had kids from all over the country filling the jailhouses up,"" Graham said. After writing a book about the Friendship Nine, a local children's author urged 16th Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett to seek a pardon for the men. ""A pardon is an act of forgiveness, but what these guys needed was not forgiveness. What these guys needed was justice,"" Brackett said. ""Justice served is the greatest interest of man on earth,"" Judge John C. Hayes III said about his move to officially vacate the convictions. Hayes is the nephew of the judge who presided over the case. ""We cannot rewrite history, but we can right history,"" Hayes said.","Vandal or vandals painted racial slur on rock in front of South Carolina high school .

"Gauteng, South Africa (CNN)""I was in a position to see exactly what happens in the human hand. I got the basics of what it's all about and thought yeah, I'll make my own."" Richard van As is recalling the moment in May 2011 when he sat in a Johannesburg hospital waiting to hear if his fingers could be stitched back on. Just an hour earlier, he had been in his carpentry workshop sawing wood when the saw slipped and ripped diagonally through the four fingers on his right hand. ""It all happened too quickly to know what actually happened,"" he remembers. Rather than fear the outcome, or dwell on the repercussions of losing his fingers, he was already thinking of ways to fix the problem, like a true carpenter. After days of scouring the Internet he couldn't find anywhere to buy a functional prosthetic finger and he was astonished at the cost of prosthetic hands and limbs which began in the tens of thousands of dollars. But his online surfing paid off as it brought him to an amateur video posted by a mechanical effects artist in Washington State, by the name of Ivan Owen. Together, the pair developed a mechanical finger for van As, but their partnership has also gone on to benefit countless hand and arm amputees around the globe, through the birth of the company ""Robohand."" Officially launched in January 2012, Robohand creates affordable mechanical prosthetics through the use of 3D printers. Not only that, but it has made its designs open source, so that anyone with access to such printers can print out fingers, hands and now arms as well. Printing prosthetics . Using the process of additive manufacture, the specialized printers use the thermoplastic material Polylactide (PLA) to print body parts such as knuckles and joints, which when combined with stainless steel and aluminum produce a personalized prosthetic which customers can assemble and fit themselves courtesy of a free open-source manual available to them. Within five minutes of getting it fitted, people can actually use it,"" explains Leonard Nel, the communications manager in the team. ""It's anatomically driven by the wrist, elbow, or shoulder once fitted,"" he adds -- meaning its movements are controlled by the user. The first Robohand ever created was made for five-year-old Liam, from South Africa, who was born with amniotic band syndrome (ABS), which left him with no fingers on his right hand. Within minutes of fitting his newly printed mechanical hand Liam beamed excitedly and expressed how he could now ""pick up stuff,"" describing its movement by saying: ""it copies me."" ""They all have their special moment,"" says Nel. Van As drives the whole process on simplicity, voicing his desire to remove unnecessary red tape and cost when providing people with something as essential as a limb. A full adult hand costs as little as $2,000, takes five and a half hours to print and approximately 10-15 hours to assemble. Ordering a prosthetic is also quite simple. Customers are sent measurement forms to complete and send those in combination with 3-D scans of their hands for translation into the software, which will print out the parts for their desired prosthetic. Where 3-D scans aren't feasible, hard molds can instead be made and shipped to the team in South Africa. The simplicity of the ordering process has led to demand outstripping what Robohand can supply, with requests for limbs coming from almost every country around the globe. There is now an eight-month waiting list when orders are placed. ""I know of only three countries that haven't had a hand yet,"" says van As. ""To make sure everyone can have access we essentially steal from the rich and give to the poor. Those who can afford it pay, and those that can't we find a way for someone to pay it for them."" Because Robohand's manuals and 3-D printable files are available online, others are also using its designs to print prosthetics. ""We stopped counting at 200 hands that were made back in November 2013,"" says van As. ""But we can see there have now been over 143,000 downloads of the software. People all over the world are doing this without us. We don't even know of them all."" Paying it forward . The majority of its customers are in the United States, where most customers can afford its relatively low prices, so van As is able to subsidize prosthetics for those who are more disadvantaged. ""We had Dylan Laas in L.A. who received a Robohand and when his dad saw the impact he paid for Waldo, another person on our waiting list, to receive one as well,"" says van As. Waldo was also born with ABS, like Liam, leaving him no fingers on his right hand, and van As was able to fit him with a working hand too. ""It's all about paying it forward as people want to help,"" says van As. Robohand is growing and the team plans on expanding past the fingers and arms currently on offer. ""Our next step is to print whole legs for people to use and walk on,"" explains van As. But it doesn't stop there. ""Then if we make that work, the goal is entire exoskeletons, for paraplegics to be able to walk again.""","Robohand makes cheap artificial hands and arms using 3-D printers .

"European Union newcomer Croatia is looking to undiscovered oil and gas fields in the Adriatic Sea to revive its ailing economy, according to the country's president. Ivo Josipovic told CNN that Croatia -- soon to become the 28th member of the European Union -- is searching for partners in the energy sector to help reveal oil and gas ""green fields"" in the waters that separate the Balkan nations and Italy. Read more: Croatia PM: We need Italy to recover . The country, which relies heavily on its sun-kissed Adriatic coast to attract tourists and boost the economy, is seeking new revenue streams to combat a high national debt and a lack of competitiveness. In 2012, Croatia's economy contracted by 2% and is expected to contract by 1% this year, according to Eurostat -- the European Commission's data service. ""There is one way to change the economy and that is to motivate investors to come to Croatia,"" Josipovic told CNN in an exclusive interview. Croatia -- a small country of 4.3 million people -- is also battling against chronic unemployment over 18%, with only Greece and Spain having a higher jobless rate. But Josipovic is adamant that Croatia's European membership, which officially begins on July 1, will attract foreign investment and prevent a so-called ""brain drain"" in the country's workforce. ""Brain drain is always connected to a bad economic situation, with the EU or without the EU,"" he said.

Josipovic said the euro is already a de facto currency in Croatia but the country needs at least five years to meet the euro area criteria before it can think about joining. ""[There is] no special target year,"" he told CNN. ""But we think we already have the euro because if you ask someone the price, they tell you in euros.

"(CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight is out of the hospital and back in law enforcement custody, where he's being held for his part in a fatal hit-and-run last week in Compton, California. Knight, 49, complained of chest pains in court Tuesday after pleading not guilty to murder charges for allegedly running over two men -- killing one of them -- following an argument. After being released from the hospital, Knight was taken back into custody by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department a little before 9 p.m. Wednesday (midnight ET), Deputy Kelvin Moody told CNN. ""We are not purview to any medical treatment he may be for receiving,"" said the Sheriff's Department spokesman, who did not specify whether Knight was being held in a normal jail cell or elsewhere. Mark Blankenship, president of Everlert Entertainment and who has business dealings with Knight, told reporters Tuesday that Knight ""has special medicine he needs"" that he couldn't access after turning himself in early last Friday, flanked by his lawyer. The deadly incident happened January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. ""It looks like he drove backward and struck the victims,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. John Corina said of Knight. ""And then went forward and struck them again as he left."" Officers later found Knight's Ford Raptor abandoned in nearby Westwood. His attorney, David Kenner, said Knight felt remorseful about the death of former rap record label owner Terry Carter and injuries to Cle ""Bone"" Sloan, both of whom he considers longtime friends. ""From what I understand ... he was being attacked and trying to get away from that attack, no more than that,"" Kenner said. ""... It's not his fault."" Michael Shapiro -- the attorney for Sloan, 51, who is out of the hospital after suffering a serious concussion and having his left foot mangled -- dismissed that version of events as ""absurd."" The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. And in August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. At the time of his most recent arrest, Knight was free on bail in a robbery case. CNN's Paul Vercammen and Stella Chan contributed to this report.","Spokesman: Ex-rap mogul back in L.A.

"An 18-year-old student drove to a community college campus located inside a western Virginia mall on Friday, walked in, then opened fire -- wounding two women -- before being subdued by an off-duty security guard and two police officers, authorities said. Christiansburg, Virginia, police Chief Mark Sisson identified the suspect Friday night as Neil Allen MacInnis, who he said was a student at New River Community College. An item on the online forum 4chan -- posted at 1:52 p.m. Friday, three minutes before police estimated the shooting began -- said it was from Neil MacInnis, who wrote that he goes to the same community college's satellite campus in Christiansburg. The post urged people to check out an online stream of the New River Valley Public Safety scanner and promised, ""I'm gonna give y'all the details because the news never gets it right."" ""I'm a bit nervous because I've never really handled a shotgun but a few times with the Christiansburg police,"" the poster said. ""Anyways this is not a highscores game but actually a lesson (that's why I'm at school)."" The post then gave a link to a New River Community College personal webpage under MacInnis' name. ""Wish me luck,"" it added. CNN could not immediately verify that the 4chan post -- which CNN tracked down hours before Sisson identified the suspect -- was written by MacInnis. The Christiansburg police chief did acknowledge that authorities were looking into social media reports. Several elements mentioned in the 4chan post paralleled what Sisson told reporters Friday night, including that MacInnis was enrolled at the community college, lives in Christiansburg and attended that city's citizen police academy last year. The webpage included in the 4chan post offered other corroborating details. A man pictured on that page, for instance, resembles the mugshot of MacInnis that Christiansburg police released on Friday night. Sisson said the suspect got out of his car and walked into his college's campus at the New River Valley in Christiansburg around 1:55 p.m. Friday. He then shot the two women, before being taken down. ""The suspect was in custody within five minutes,"" the police chief said. A woman who works at a mall clothing store near the campus described a frenetic scene after the shots rang out. ""We were a little in disbelief at first, but we saw people running away from that area,"" Diana Greenman told CNN affiliate WDBJ. The victims were transported -- one by helicopter, the other by ambulance -- to hospitals for treatment of their gunshot wounds. There was no word Friday night on their conditions. One of them worked part-time at New River Community College, while authorities were still working Friday night to ascertain what relationship the other victim had, if any, to the school, the police chief said. Investigators also were trying to pin down whether MacInnis and the two women knew each other. The police chief didn't offer many other details, including about the kind of weapon used, how the suspect got the gun and how many shots were fired. But he did say that police don't think other people were involved. ""We believe that MacInnis acted alone, and there are no additional threats to this community,"" Sisson said. On Friday night, while the mall where he allegedly shot the women was shut down except for law enforcement authorities, MacInnis was in the Montgomery County Jail. He was being held without bond after being charged on two counts of malicious wounding and two counts of use of a firearm during the commission of a felony, Sisson said.","Police identify the suspect as Neil MacInnis, a student at New River Community College .

"When can a government kill its own people? The straightforward question has anything but a simple answer, especially for the government of a nation founded on inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Monday's news that the Obama administration is considering a military hit on an American terrorist raises anew the issue of what justifies such a step, according to both the law and the public conscience in an era of political, social and technological evolution. ""America's legitimate claim of self-defense cannot be the end of the discussion,"" President Barack Obama said last year when he announced new guidelines on drone strikes that target enemies for killing. ""To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance.  For the same human progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it."" The American Civil Liberties Union contends the administration abuses its power, particularly when it comes to drone strikes that have targeted foreigners and in some cases, American citizens. ""Even in the context of an armed conflict against an armed group, the government may use lethal force only against individuals who are directly participating in hostilities against the United States,"" the group says on its website. ""Regardless of the context, whenever the government uses lethal force, it must take all possible steps to avoid harming civilian bystanders. But these are not the standards that the executive branch is using."" Here are questions about what the government is doing, with explanation of why and arguments against: . 1)            What does targeted killing mean, and how widespread is it? After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, a traumatized nation responded with new laws that greatly expanded the government's power to fight terrorism. Wars were launched in Afghanistan and then Iraq, and the national intelligence system expanded to new capacity disclosed in last year's classified leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Part of the expanded powers included legal authorization to target terrorists defined as enemies of the state -- people determined to be fighting a war against America. The CIA and the military have used drones and covert missions to take out such targets, including drone strikes that killed U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, a wanted terrorist, and three other Americans. Unofficial estimates based on reports by human rights groups and media accounts indicate the Obama administration has carried out hundreds of drone strikes that have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of people, including terrorists and civilians, in an escalation of the practice started by the Bush administration. Most have occurred in Afghanistan, but others have taken place in countries where no ground war was occurring including Yemen, where al-Awlaki and the two other Americans died in 2011. 2)            Is it legal for the government to target and kill people? In his May 2013 speech at the National Defense University, Obama proclaimed the practice completely legal. ""Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces,"" he said. ""We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.  So this is a just war -- a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense."" Critics, however, say the government oversteps the legal boundaries of the Constitution and international law, particularly by making decisions on targeted killings in secret without going before any court. ""The result is that the public remains in the dark about how exactly U.S. policy governing targeted killings is operating, under which legal authorities, and who exactly are its victims,"" said a letter to Obama in December from nine rights groups. Hina Shamsi, who directs the ACLU's National Security Project, told CNN that the Obama administration was ""fighting hard"" to prevent a judicial review of the strikes that killed al-Awlaki and the other Americans, including the terrorist's 16-year-old son. Until allegations in classified documents can be assessed in court, she said, the question of whether they amount to real evidence remains unanswered. Shamsi called the U.S. actions ""one of the most extreme and dangerous forms of authority that the executive branch can claim -- the power to kill people based on vague and shifting legal standards, secret evidence and no judicial review even after the fact."" In 2010, a federal judge in Washington noted the government would need permission from a federal court to wiretap al-Awlaki, but that no such court process existed in order to kill him. Rejecting an effort by al-Awlaki's father to block his son's possible extrajudicial killing, U.S. District Judge John Bates called it ""somewhat unsettling"" that a president could -- for national security reasons -- make a unilateral decision to kill a U.S. citizen overseas and the decision would be ""judicially unreviewable."" 3)            Even if it is legal by the letter of the law, is it morally or politically right? Obama has insisted his responsibility as commander in chief to protect Americans from attack justified targeted killings like the drone strike on al-Awlaki. In his speech last May, he rejected targeting an American citizen without what he called ""due process,"" meaning adherence to full legal procedures. Then he explained the reasoning for the al-Awlaki hit two years earlier, before the expanded policy guidelines he was announcing. ""When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens, and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot, his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team,"" Obama said, citing al-Awlaki by name. ""I would have detained and prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a plot, but we couldn't,"" Obama continued. ""And as President, I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took him out."" Shamsi, who argued the ACLU's federal court case seeking judicial review of the strikes on al-Awlaki and two other Americans, contended that the government has failed to adhere to the oversight it set up for targeted killings. ""Policy restrictions are well and good, but the administration appears to have gone well beyond them based on the investigate reports of human rights organizations and media accounts,"" she said Monday. 4)            Does it work? Ever the politician, Obama argued forcefully last year that targeted killings were a necessary tool in the expanding battle against international terrorism. ""Dozens of highly skilled al Qaeda commanders, trainers, bomb makers and operatives have been taken off the battlefield,"" he said. ""Plots have been disrupted that would have targeted international aviation, U.S. transit systems, European cities and our troops in Afghanistan.  Simply put, these strikes have saved lives."" Critics, including congressional Republicans, argue the President's anti-terrorism strategy, which in many ways extended programs and practices started after the 9/11 attacks under the Bush administration, have failed to effectively curtail al Qaeda. Asked last week at a congressional hearing if al Qaeda was stronger or weaker today than before the 9/11 attacks, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper struggled to find an answer before conceding the terrorist network now was more widespread and therefore more difficult to combat. At the same hearing, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers argued that tighter restrictions on targeted killings announced by Obama in last year's policy speech had weakened the government's fight against terrorism. ""Today, individuals who would have been previously removed from the battlefield by U.S. counter-terrorism operations for attacking or plotting to attack against U.S. interests remain free because of self-imposed red tape,"" the Michigan Republican said, adding that ""the President's May 2013 policy changes for the U.S. targeted strikes are an utter and complete failure, and they leave Americans' lives at risk."" However, the criticism by Rogers differs from Shamsi's accusation that the administration fails to adhere to the stated policies of increased oversight and following due process. Rogers complained that the problem involved confusion over the U.S. policies. 5)            Is it worth it? To Obama, the need to take out war enemies supersedes the potential political fallout at home and abroad over drone strikes and other targeted killings. He argued last year that doing nothing would invite ""far more civilian casualties"" by terrorists targeting U.S. cities as well as foreign strongholds in Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere. ""Remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians, and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes,"" he argued, saying that ""doing nothing is not an option."" Obama also contended the drone strikes were less risky than conventional weapons or ""boots on the ground"" in terms of collateral damage and broader political repercussions. ""It is false to assert that putting boots on the ground is less likely to result in civilian deaths or less likely to create enemies in the Muslim world,"" he said, referring to unpopular U.S. military incidents of recent decades. ""The results would be more U.S. deaths, more Black Hawks down, more confrontations with local populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars."" On the ground, though, drone strikes that kill civilians evoke rage and resentment against the United States that can breed more anti-American activism. To Shamsi, the threat also is to core American values back home. ""There's enough credible reporting about tragic wrongful killings and mistakes having been made,"" she told CNN. ""It helps neither the security of the United States nor the victims of its policies, because in the end, long-term national security depends on our real commitment to our laws and our values.""","Sources: the Obama administration is considering a strike on a U.S. terror suspect .

"(CNN) -- The grand jury has made its decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown last August in Ferguson, Missouri. But another verdict became clear last night, too. The decision by St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch to announce the decision at 8:30 p.m. CT was foolish and dangerous. Here's the thing about that time of night: it's dark. Anyone -- anyone! -- should have known that the decision in the Brown case would have been controversial. A decision not to indict, which was always possible, even likely, would have been sure to attract protests, even violence. Crowd control is always more difficult in the dark. The grand jury's deliberations concluded around lunchtime on Monday. It would have been simple to make the announcement while it was still daytime. Still, McCulloch said that he would not announce the grand jury's decision until 8 p.m. CT. Read Wilson's grand jury testimony . At a news conference in the late afternoon, Gov. Jay Nixon was asked about this nighttime announcement. In an answer that was consistent with his generally clueless performance throughout this crisis, Nixon said the decision to announce the decision at night was made solely by McCulloch. In other words, don't ask him! He's only the governor! Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . McCulloch started his announcement late, and he was not finished until around 9 p.m., local time. His tone was icy and divisive. His sympathy for the Brown family was perfunctory. He seemed more angry at the news media than about the death of a young man. Are protests taking place near you? The predictable reaction ensued. Protests began, some of them violent. Police responded with tear gas. Fires burned. Cars were destroyed. Gunshots were heard. The full scale of the damage was difficult to assess last night. The ultimate verdict on the grand jury's decision is up to history at this point. But the verdict on McCulloch opting to announce the decision at night is clear -- and devastating. Protests spread far beyond Ferguson .","Jeffrey Toobin says prosecutor's choice to announce grand jury decision at night was clueless .

"For years, China has talked about promoting ""green growth."" But this probably isn't what they had in mind. For the seventh year in a row, monstrous quantities of green algae known as enteromorpha prolifera have sprouted in the coastal waters near Qingdao, China. But this year's growth, covering 28,900 square kilometers (11,158 square miles), is the biggest outbreak ever recorded, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The previous record was 13,000 square kilometers (5019 square miles) in 2008. Swimmers and beachgoers were pictured frolicking among the stringy piles of slime, while bulldozers attempted to scoop it away. Chinese officials have blamed past algae outbreaks on unusually warm seas. Dr. Christopher Bolch, an algae expert at the University of Tasmania, says the explanation doesn't hold water. ""You may get faster growth rates with higher temperatures, but you can't get such large amounts of biomass without access to nutrients,"" he explained. According to Bolch, massive algae blooms feed off of high levels of nitrites and phosphates in the water, which typically comes from agricultural waste, industrial pollution, or human sewage from highly populated areas. Enteromorpha is ""fairly benign,"" said Bolch, but can harm marine ecosystems. Algae blocks sunlight from reaching aquatic life, reduces oxygen levels, and emits bacteria when the algae dies and rots. Similar but more dangerous types of aquatic growths, such as phytobacteria or dinoflagellates, can produce harmful toxins and posion people.  ""They should consider themselves quite lucky that it's not one of those,"" said Bolch. Chinese state media reported that the seaweed began proliferating on June 5, and that local governments had ""taken measures"" to minimize the impact to marine ecosystems. Officials reported that they had removed around 7,335 tons of algae. Bolch said enteromorpha typically does not cause health problems in humans, but ""large concentrations of anything can be problematic."" There could be a risk of skin inflammation, said Bolch.

"(CNN)Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko said Friday that a ceasefire due to go into effect over the weekend between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine is in ""big danger."" Fighting continued ahead of the cessation of the bitter 10-month-long conflict that has killed more than 5,000 people and strained East-West relations. The peace plan hammered out Thursday during marathon four-way talks in Minsk, Belarus, had raised hopes of an end to the fighting. But Poroshenko said that after the agreement reached by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, the offensive against Ukrainian troops by pro-Russian separatists had intensified. ""This is not just an attack on Ukrainian civilians, this is an attack of the Minsk results,"" he said in Kiev, adding the peace plan is in ""big danger."" The ceasefire agreement comes with many questions over how it will be implemented and whether it will stick. The first test will be whether the guns fall silent when the ceasefire comes into force at midnight local time Saturday to Sunday. Both sides are expected to start pulling back their heavy weapons from the front lines as of Monday, creating a buffer zone at least 50 kilometers (31 miles) wide. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which already has a monitoring mission in Ukraine, has been given the challenging task of overseeing the process. ""We need to have an effective ceasefire,"" said OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier, at a media briefing. ""So I'm already concerned that we are seeing this morning a continuation of hostilities."" The OSCE hopes to see a reduction in hostilities between now and the start of the ceasefire, he said. But reports from eastern Ukraine -- where separatist soldiers told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh on Thursday that they were highly skeptical of the peace plan -- suggest otherwise. Eight Ukrainian soldiers have died and 34 have been injured in the past 24 hours, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Friday morning. There were 40 incidents of militants opening fire and shelling in the conflict area overnight, including 25 in the Debaltseve area, it said. What will happen to the strategically important, government-controlled town of Debaltseve, under siege by separatist forces for weeks, is one of the big unanswered questions. Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers remain there, almost surrounded, and it's unclear who will ultimately control the town when the ceasefire comes into effect. The water began running Thursday night for the first time in a week at the Konopliovi home in Horlivka. A bath was quickly drawn so the three children could clean up. The kids' mother went to another room to get a towel and the first shell hit, wiping out the bathroom but leaving the parents' bedroom -- even its windows -- intact. Nastya, 14; Dasha, 7; and Kiriusha,  2 1/2 , were dead. ""What ceasefire? I curse every day those who killed my children, and all those of the country. People who want to live peacefully,"" Liuba Konopliovi told CNN, according to a translator. ""We lived, grew up, took our children to school. They are not people."" Doctors Without Borders said in a ""crisis update"" from one of its doctors in Horlivka that between five and 20 victims are brought to their facility each day. On one occasion, there were 60 victims. But on three days, there was no water with which to sterilize the equipment, so only urgent care was administered. Despite the uncertainties over the deal, all those at the Minsk talks said it was a better alternative than simply allowing the escalating violence to continue. ""We had just two options: bad, and worse. So we decided at this particular period of time to get the bad option. Probably this option will save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers, and I hope this option will save lives of Ukrainian civilians, of innocent people, who are under a constant shelling of Russian-led terrorists,"" Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen in Kiev. ""It's better to have this new deal rather than not to have (it). But we do not trust any words or any papers. We are to trust only actions and deeds,"" he said. The White House issued a statement with a tone of guarded optimism and urged all parties to take ""immediate, concrete steps"" to fulfill their commitments. ""Heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the conflict zone, and Russia must end its support for the separatists and withdraw its soldiers and military equipment from eastern Ukraine,"" the statement said. While the Ukrainian forces have to pull back their heavy weapons from the front line as it stands Saturday night, the separatist forces must pull back theirs from the front line as it was on September 19, when a previous peace agreement was signed in Minsk. That swiftly disintegrated amid continued violence. The new ceasefire proposal represents a territorial gain for the separatists, who control parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking after the talks wrapped up alongside French President Francois Hollande, said that what had been achieved gave ""a glimmer of hope"" but that big hurdles still lay ahead. European Union leaders who met in Brussels later Thursday ""did not discuss any new sanctions against Russia,"" European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters in the Belgian capital. Tusk said that the EU wants ""to encourage"" Russia to implement the new Minsk agreement, but he also advised caution in light of how the first Minsk agreement unraveled. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's state-run RIA Novosti that while Russia had helped to bring about the Minsk agreement, it wasn't in its power to fulfill it. ""We simply can't do this physically because Russia is not a participant in the conflict,"" Peskov said. Moscow hopes that all of the points drawn up in the Minsk deal will be fulfilled, he added. Russia has steadfastly denied accusations that it is sending forces and weapons into Ukraine. But top Western and Ukrainian leaders have said there isn't any doubt that Russia is behind surging violence and separatists' efforts to take over territory in eastern Ukraine. Zannier, the OSCE secretary general, said his organization intends to put 350 monitors into eastern Ukraine to oversee the ceasefire and withdrawal process. Under the terms of the Minsk agreement, it can use radar, satellite and drone technology to help it. But he warned that unless the environment becomes less hostile, there are limits to where the OSCE teams can go. Details of the new agreement, which is similar in part to the September 19 deal, were released Thursday, but it's still unclear how elements of it will work. The points include: . • An immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in parts of Donetsk and Luhansk starting at midnight on February 15. • The withdrawal of all heavy weapons by both parties at equal distances in order to create a security zone width of at least 50 kilometers (31 miles) from each other for artillery systems and more for longer-range weapons. • This process should begin no later than the next day after the ceasefire and should be over within 14 days. • A dialogue on new local elections and the special status of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions will begin the day after the withdrawal. • A law will be created to give amnesty to people involved in events in Luhansk and Donetsk. • Both sides must ensure the release and exchange of all hostages and illegally held prisoners by no later than the fifth day after the withdrawal. • Withdrawal of all foreign troops and military equipment from Ukraine, including mercenaries, and the disarmament of militia groups.

"(CNN)It's one of the biggest sporting events on the planet and in a growing market for new fans, football's global governing body has cut a media rights deal  for the 2026 World Cup over a decade ahead of the tournament. FIFA extended its North American media rights agreements -- handing Fox the English language deal and NBCUniversal's Telemundo the Spanish language rights -- for an event in which the 2026 host nation has still to be determined. ""These agreements guarantee wide distribution for FIFA tournaments across the U.S. and Canada,"" said FIFA Director of TV Niclas Ericson in a statement. ""Together, we will be able to further promote football in North America and build on the impressive interest shown by audiences in these major territories during the 2014 FIFA World Cup."" Just days after the English Premier League sold domestic television rights for over $8 billion for the three seasons from 2016, FIFA declined to detail what the latest North American deal was worth. Football's world governing body also refused to comment when asked if it had received sealed bids from rival broadcasters. Neither ESPN nor NBC responded to a CNN email asking if they had bid for the English language rights. That raises the question as to whether Fox, which already had agreements in place for the 2018 and 2022 editions following a $425 million deal signed in 2011, won the latest contract without any competition. The U.S. broadcaster has been outspoken over FIFA's plans to move the 2022 World Cup to the Qatari winter because of fears over the intense heat during the Gulf state's summer months. While a working party is expected to recommend suitable dates for the 2022 tournament on February 23, a switch to winter would play havoc with the U.S. sporting schedule. ""You go into buying a World Cup and you believe it's going to be in the same time frame it's always been,"" Fox Sports President Eric Shanks said last year. ""Clearly in America there's much more competition for ratings points."" A move to winter would be bad news for Fox given it could clash with the NFL playoffs and potentially the 2022 Winter Olympics. Some media commentators have suggested Fox was awarded the latest deal on the proviso that it will not make a complaint when the 2022 tournament is shifted to the Qatari winter. Potentially the 2026 tournament could be held in North America given it will be 32 years since the World Cup was last held there. Yet the question remains why wouldn't FIFA want to benefit from a bidding war between Fox, ESPN and NBC and why sell the rights so early? ""FIFA aims to distribute the highest quality coverage of its international tournaments to as wide an audience as possible,"" said FIFA in a statement to CNN. ""FIFA constantly reviews and monitors global market conditions for sports media rights in order to make the best decision for each market. ""The agreement extensions announced on Thursday were the result of a detailed assessment of the market and discussions with the relevant broadcasters."" NBC, which retained Spanish-language rights through Telemundo, refused to comment on whether it had been invited to bid for the English version . ''We were offered the opportunity to extend our Spanish-language rights for another cycle ... and we were happy to be able to complete the transaction,'' NBC Sports said in a statement. The 2014 World Cup final between Argentina and Germany was watched by an estimated 26.5 million in the U.S. which was up 7% on the 2010 figures. ""These events are some of the world's most important sports competitions, and it is our privilege to be entrusted with these rights in the United States,"" Fox said in a statement.","Fox Sports wins rights to broadcast 2026 World Cup in USA .

"A federal judge said Monday that he believes the government's once-secret collection of domestic phone records is unconstitutional, setting up likely appeals and further challenges to the data mining revealed by classified leaker Edward Snowden. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the National Security Agency's bulk collection of metadata -- phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content -- apparently violates privacy rights. His preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice, but Leon limited the decision only to their cases. ""I cannot imagine a more 'indiscriminate' and 'arbitrary invasion' than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval,"" said Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush. ""Surely, such a program infringes on 'that degree of privacy' that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment."" Leon's ruling said the ""plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a Fourth Amendment claim,"" adding ""as such, they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury."" He rejected the government's argument that a 1979 Maryland case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata, noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in the past three decades. Leon also noted that the government ""does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature."" However, he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information, pending an appeal by the government. A Justice Department spokesman said Monday that ""we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found,"" but said the ruling is being studied. Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, a critic of the NSA data mining, said Leon's ruling showed that ""the bulk collection of Americans' phone records conflicts with Americans' privacy rights under the U.S. Constitution and has failed to make us safer."" He called on Congress to pass legislation he proposed to ""ensure the NSA focuses on terrorists and spies - and not innocent Americans."" Explosive revelations earlier this year by Snowden, a former NSA contractor, triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Snowden's revelations led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance. In a statement distributed by journalist Glenn Greenwald, who first reported the leaks, Snowden said he acted on the belief that the mass surveillance program would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that Americans deserved a judicial review. ""Today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights. It is the first of many,"" according to Snowden, who is living in Russia under a grant of asylum to avoid prosecution over the leaks in the United States. Greenwald said the judge's ruling vindicates what Snowden did. ""I think it's not only the right, but the duty of an American citizen in Edward Snowden's situation to come forward, at great risk to himself, and inform his fellow citizens about what it is their government is doing in the dark that is illegal,"" the journalist told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" Monday night. The NSA has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. The case before Leon involved approval for surveillance in April by a judge at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a secret body that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for ""foreign intelligence purposes."" Verizon Business Network Services turned over the metadata to the government. Leon's ruling comes as the Obama administration completes a review of NSA surveillance in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks. CNN's Jake Tapper reported Monday that tech company executives would meet with President Barack Obama at the White House on Tuesday to discuss the issue. Obama plans to sit down with Tim Cook of Apple and Eric Schmidt of Google, as well as executives from Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Salesforce, Netflix , Etsy, Dropbox, Yahoo!, Zynga, Sherpa Global, Comcast, LinkedIn and AT&T, a White House official said. Some of those companies issued a joint letter last week calling on the government to change its surveillance policies in the wake of the Snowden revelations. Last month, the Supreme Court refused to take up the issue when it denied a separate petition, which was filed by the Electronic Information Privacy Center. Prior lawsuits against the broader NSA program also have been unsuccessful. Days after the Snowden disclosure in June, some Verizon customers filed legal challenges in the D.C. federal court. The left-leaning American Civil LIberties Union also filed a separate, pending suit in New York federal court. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s, the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests-- wiretapping, data analysis, and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States. The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government's ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad, eventually including the metadata collection. In order to collect the information, the government has to demonstrate that it's ""relevant"" to an international terrorism investigation. However, the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide: ""A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person."" In defending the program, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that ""15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 (of the Patriot Act) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations."" Initially, telecommunications companies such as Verizon, were the targets of legal action against Patriot Act provisions. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses. The revelations of the NSA program and the inner workings of the FISC court came after Snowden leaked documents to the Guardian newspaper. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then Russia to escape U.S. prosecution. The case is Klayman v. Obama (13-cv-881).","Snowden says he knew the surveillance would not withstand legal review .

"(CNN)The discovery of the tail of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 has fueled hopes that searchers may be close to recovering the plane's crucial black boxes. The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are considered to be vital elements in figuring out the causes of commercial aviation disasters. Indonesia's top search and rescue official says searchers are now ""striving"" to find the black boxes (which are actually orange). Here's the lowdown on the devices, the information they are likely to hold and how investigators will go about extracting it. What do black boxes contain? The two devices hold different kinds of information. The cockpit voice recorder contains ""every audio sound that occurs on the flight deck,"" said Desmond Ross, an aviation safety expert. That can include things like conversation between the pilots, warning sounds from the plane's systems and even hail hitting the windshield. ""It'll have the sound of the flight attendant providing a cup of coffee to the pilot if that occurred on the flight,"" Ross, a former pilot, told CNN. ""Everything that happened will be recorded."" The flight data recorder is a different beast. It stores a huge amount of information about the plane's performance. ""The flight data recorder will provide information about all aspects about what was happening with the aircraft when the disaster occurred -- everything from speed, to altitude, to the individual settings of instruments,"" said Greg Waldron, the managing editor of Flightglobal, an aviation industry website. ""It'll give a very detailed picture of what was going on last Sunday when this crash happened,"" he told CNN. Where are they? In the Airbus A320-200, the aircraft in question, the two flight recorders are housed in the tail. That has led to hopes that they could be within the grasp of the divers who took pictures of the tail section at the bottom of the Java Sea on Wednesday. Ross suggested that getting them out of the wreckage shouldn't be too tricky. ""If they have the tail and they have a few tools with them, they should be able to take those recorders out of the tail section without even having to raise the tail section to the surface,"" he said. ""It's not that hard. It's done all the time for maintenance on the ground."" But the divers have to contend with murky waters and strong currents as they search the wreckage. Removing the flight recorders ""would be similar to removing a hard drive from a damaged computer,"" Waldron said. ""It's something that you'd want to do very carefully, very slowly and very deliberately."" And AirAsia Chief Executive Tony Fernandes raised the issue of whether the piece of wreckage found by the search teams is the exact part of the tail containing the black boxes. ""I am led to believe the tail section has been found,"" he tweeted. ""If right part of tail section then the black box should be there."" What if they're not in the tail? Waldron flagged the concern that the flight recorders may have got separated from the tail of the plane as the aircraft came down, noting that officials haven't reported detecting any pings from the devices' locator beacons. ""They might have fallen free, which could create some issues,"" he said. But even if the black boxes are no longer attached to the tail, Waldron said he thought searchers would probably find them within a matter of days or weeks. Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said flight recorders can be difficult to pinpoint, even if they have locator beacons. ""The black boxes often become covered with silt and covered with metal. You have got to be directly over them,"" he said. ""It is hard to find something in the ocean. It took us days to find the black boxes at TWA 800. We were right over it. The pingers, we never picked up."" The batteries powering Flight QZ8501's  pingers are estimated to have around 20 days of power left. Will the black boxes have all the answers? Experts seem optimistic that they will. ""We're talking almost 100% certainty that we will get all the answers from those two boxes,"" Ross said. ""If the two pilots have been discussing the issue and they're talking about the problem they've got, that will tell a lot almost immediately,"" he told CNN. ""The flight data recorder will tell all the speeds, the rate of descent, the cabin pressure -- everything that has basically gone wrong in the final moments of that flight will be evident."" Black boxes don't provide the whole picture for aviation accident investigators, though. David Soucie, a former Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector, likens the process to ""peeling an onion apart and then putting that onion back together from the inside out."" Investigators map the debris found on the surface of the water. Then, they have to look for other pieces in the next level of sea for more clues, he said. ""So you might go down 50 feet or so, to see if there's any floating debris there,"" said Soucie, an aviation analyst for CNN. ""And you keep going down and mapping it as it goes. You see how the drift went and how the pieces of the plane moved."" During the investigation of Air France Flight 447, more than 150,000 images of the plane's wreckage site in the Atlantic Ocean were taken. It was important to ""mosaic them together"" to give investigators a comprehensive view of the wreckage site, said David Gallo, who co-led that search after the French jet crashed in 2009. How long will the investigation take? If they are recovered, the black boxes will be taken to a lab in Jakarta to be analyzed, according to Indonesia's National Committee for Transportation Safety (NTSC), which is leading the investigation into the disaster. ""There will be a very careful, methodical process by which these things are opened up and by which the data is extracted,"" Waldron said. ""This process is filmed, there'll be officials on hand. So it's kind of a long process."" The flight data recorder requires special software to retrieve the reams of data it contains. The NTSC's final report into Adam Air Flight 574 -- which crashed in Indonesian waters on New Year's Day, 2007, killing all 102 people on board -- came out more than a year after the disaster.

"American defense officials Tuesday pushed back against the notion that China has used cyberespionage to obtain extensive design information on advanced American weapons. ""Suggestions that cyberintrusions have somehow led to the erosion of our capabilities or technological edge are incorrect,"" said Pentagon press secretary George Little. ""We maintain full confidence in our weapons platforms."" The Pentagon was responding to a list of weapons systems whose secrets had been compromised by Chinese cyberespionage, which the Washington Post says was in a confidential report by the Defense Science Board. While the extent of the secrets stolen was not clear, the list of compromised weapons in the Post included some of the Defense Department's crown jewels of high-tech fighting: jets like the F-35 and the FA-18, anti-missile defenses like the Patriot and Aegis systems, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane. Contacted by CNN, several members of the Defense Science Board declined to comment. Former officer allegedly leaked U.S. military secrets to Chinese girlfriend . But James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that China could use such cyberespionage in several ways that could put American fighters at risk: to copy weapons technology, counter American weapons based on that knowledge or even disrupt their operation by interfering with the software that runs them. ""If you mess with that software,"" he said, ""the airplane won't fly. The missile will miss its target and the ship might not get where it was intended to go."" Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, described cyberespionage as ""tremendously serious."" ""The viciousness, and just the volume of attacks, not only by the Chinese but Russians and others trying to get the blueprints of our most sensitive material is just breathtaking -- and they're getting better,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. He laid out why such attacks might matter. ""We, in some cases, have to go back for any material that may have been stolen ... and redesign it. It costs more money,"" he said. ""It costs billions and billions of dollars extra to try to make sure that we're staying ahead of our adversaries with technology. When they steal it, they leap ahead. That means we have to invest more, and change that technology. It is a serious problem."" In a publicly released portion of the Defense Science Board's report, the authors warn that cyberwarfare ""may impose severe consequences for U.S. forces engaged in combat,"" including American weapons failing to operate, communications problems, or even planes or satellites potentially crashing. One American official, while acknowledging cyberintrusions from China, said the claims of design details being compromised were overstated. ""The idea that somehow whoever the intruders were got the keys to the weapons kingdom is a stretch,"" the official said. ""Getting one piece without the rest of the parts makes it hard to build a weapons platform."" Defense officials also said they have taken steps to address the concerns, and that some of the information about potential breaches was dated. Kevin Mandia of Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm that has also been tracking Chinese military hackers, said that while many key Pentagon installations are well-fortified against hackers, cyberdefenses need to be deployed more widely. ""There's a lot of engineering that gets done in an academic setting,"" he said. ""There's a lot of engineering that gets done at the defense industrial base. And a lot of these places have been compromised for over 10 years."" The allegation of cyberpenetration comes at a time when China has been stepping up its efforts to close the gap with the United States in terms of advanced military technology. In recent years, China has tested a missile that knocked out a satellite, conducted test flights of a stealth warplane, deployed its first aircraft carrier and developed an advanced ""carrier-killer"" missile for warfare against ships. China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to inquiries from CNN about the allegation of stealing secrets. But in the past, Chinese officials have said China does not conduct cyberespionage on U.S. agencies or companies.","""We maintain full confidence in our weapons platforms,"" says Pentagon spokesman .

"In our modern, viral times, sometimes seemingly insignificant events make the difference between oblivion and infamy.  Sometimes it's mere words that lift a person from obscurity to condemnation.  In the case of 16-year-old Texan Ethan Couch, it was one.  One word.  ""Affluenza"". Couch admitted to intoxication manslaughter after causing four deaths in a motor vehicle accident.  A psychologist testified in Couch's adjudicatory hearing in juvenile court that because of the child's home life, the boy should not receive the maximum 20-year prison sentence prosecutors were seeking.  Instead, the judge gave him 10 years of probation for the fatal accident.  Outrage followed. Affluenza is a term used by the psychologist testifying for Couch at the disposition phase of the case, to describe children who have a sense of entitlement, are irresponsible, and make excuses for poor behavior because parents have not set proper boundaries. The resulting public anger is understandable: Intoxication manslaughter is always by nature a senseless crime, and  sadly not all that uncommon.  So then, what about Couch's case is so much more controversial than other DUI fatalities?  The answer has to do with our perception of the juvenile justice system, and our understanding of the adolescent mind.  The other reason: our culture's firmly entrenched intolerance for spoiled rich kids. Liability vs. disposition . If you ask most people, they likely think ""affluenza"" was used by Couch as a defense to the crime—that he sought to avoid all responsibility.  But there are two phases of a criminal case, whether in adult court or juvenile court.  First is the guilt phase.  The main questions asked here are: ""did he do it?"" or ""is he responsible for doing it?""  This is the part of trial that we are most familiar with from TV: where a defendant is found guilty or not guilty by jury verdict. If a child is adjudicated delinquent (the equivalent of ""guilty"" in adult court), the judge moves on to phase two: disposition.  In juvenile court, this means the judge determines how to best treat, rehabilitate or supervise the child. Paul Callan: The cure for 'affluenza' is prison . Some of the dispositions mirror the punitive spirit of the adult system, but a juvenile judge has more options: A child can be ordered to pay restitution, have an imposed curfew, or be sent to a secure educational facility.  In lesser cases, I've seen plenty of judges order that apology letters be written, and even given assigned reading of self-help or inspirational books, with a book report due at the next court date. The overall mission of juvenile courts is redemption, not retribution. In Couch's case, Texas has a relatively tough ""determinate sentencing"" scheme in which juveniles can be sentenced to adult terms in prison that begin when the child ages out of the juvenile system. In other words, he could potentially leave juvenile placement when he turns 19, and be transferred to adult prison to serve the remainder of his time. That's what the prosecution sought in this case: adult time for the child that would begin when he turned 19, ostensibly with credit for the time served in the juvenile system (from 16-19 years of age). So, it's important to understand that Couch did not assert that he was ""not guilty"" by reason of affluenza. Rather, affluenza was raised in the sentencing phase, as a critical piece of ""mitigation."" ""Mitigating circumstances"" are not a justification or excuse of the offense in question. That part of the case has already concluded with a verdict or judgment.  Rather, mitigating evidence may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability as the court considers a proper sentence. If we agree that defendants at least have a right to ask for mercy from the court, it follows that they must be able to present reasons for that mercy.  Of course, the judge may give this evidence the weight he or she deems appropriate. Affluenza was never going to exonerate Couch.  Affluenza only had the potential to be one of several factors considered in arriving at appropriate punishment or rehabilitation. Health: 'Affluenza': Is it real? Other mitigating factors courts consider are school performance, a lack of prior contacts with law enforcement, and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions in court.  In Couch's case, for example, we know that he admitted (the equivalent of ""pleaded guilty"") to intoxication manslaughter, which means he took responsibility. Any juvenile legal practitioner will tell you that if these other factors are in the client's favor, he's a likely candidate for lenient disposition, particularly if there are no prior arrests. Of course, the tragic deaths of four persons also weighs heavily against Couch in this case. At its core, affluenza was a poorly chosen catchphrase that obfuscated the important underlying point: that, rich or poor, this was another child who, according to an expert qualified by the court, suffered from the same lack of supervision and guidance that plagues millions of American children, irrespective of class.  That's all. Many are offended at this idea because the child comes from a wealthy family.  But being so offended reflects a belief that children of wealth can never have any developmental problems, or be neglected in a way that affects their adolescent judgment. Worse, this view suggests that only the working class or poor are entitled to claim environmental or neurological disadvantages.  That is an indefensible position. It's true that society has always had a jaded view of rich youth and their antics.  That's an understandable sentiment—reality TV alone shoves plenty of privileged, unsympathetic characters in our faces every night. It's hard for Americans to drum up a lot of sympathy for a Kardashian's divorce when most of us are watching from a bean bag chair in a studio apartment.  But we must separate that resentment from our duty to our children, because all children, rich or poor, are developmentally different from adults. Neuroscience and the Supreme Court: Children are different . For millennia, parents have known that children are different from adults in their motivation, judgment and decision-making.  Now, in modern times, the science backs it up.  But are we prepared to accept the proof? The Supreme Court has recognized that children lack adults' capacity for mature judgment, they are more vulnerable to negative external influences, and their character is simply not fully formed. Neuroscience has accumulated significant evidence that the adolescent brain is not fully developed, and may not be fully developed until into adulthood. Studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex in children lacks areas and interconnections critical to planning, motivation, judgment and decision-making. These are not just behavioral observations; they are backed up by neuroimaging studies.   By way of one example, during childhood and early adolescence the brain undergoes a significant ""pruning"" of unused synapses, which leads to more efficient neural connections.  During adolescence, this activity is seen more in the prefrontal cortex than other brain regions. This, in turn, is consistent with the understanding that adolescence is a time of not-yet-perfected executive functions. The developmental research and behavioral studies are increasingly backed by the neuroscience: As children, our executive functions, such as risk assessment and judgment, are still undeveloped. Of course, a reasonable response to this is: ""Yes, but for every kid who commits a crime, there are millions who do not, who are able to conform their conduct to the law.""  Very true. But if we agree that at a certain age, children have no criminal intent, it follows that the maturation of the adult mind is not an overnight process. There is a developmental period.  And, according to the behavioral and neurological science, it is a considerable span of time.  So it follows that while juveniles should be held responsible for their actions, if their brains are different than adults' brains, then their intent and therefore their culpability must also be different. Fortunately, the juvenile justice system does not seek to absolve juveniles of all liability; if it did, delinquency court would not exist.  Instead, an understanding of the adolescent mind helps courts fashion the appropriate remedy. Let's face it: Our society does not like spoiled rich kids, especially when they squander opportunities that most of us did not have, and abuse their position.  That is an understandable reaction to a tragedy like this.  But we have a duty to rise above that bias and recognize the broader issue: Children are different from adults, and they deserve differential treatment, rich or poor.","Danny Cevallos: The world condemned 16-year-old Texan for defense's use of ""affluenza""

"Scientists are concerned about what they're seeing so far this flu season, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday, a day after the agency advised doctors this year's flu vaccine is not as effective because the current strain of the virus has mutated. Dr. Tom Frieden said researchers are worried that with this particular strain of the virus, ""we could have a season that is more severe than most with more hospitalizations and more deaths."" The advisory sent Wednesday said 52% of the 85 influenza virus samples collected and analyzed from October 1 through November 22 were different than the virus strains included in this year's vaccine, indicating a mutation, or drift, of the strain. The most common strain of the virus reported so far this season is influenza A (H3N2). In the past, this strain has been linked to higher rates of hospitalization and death, especially for those at high risk for complications, which is usually the very young, the elderly and those with chronic health conditions such as asthma or heart problems. In February, a panel of experts decided on 3 strains of the virus to include in this year's vaccine, based on data about the  common strains circulating around the globe throughout the year. Some years the vaccine is a better match to the circulating strains than others. It's too late to create another version of the flu vaccine this year, Frieden said, because even with modern production technology, it typically takes about four months to produce the vaccine. While this year's version is not as protective against a mutated strain, it can still decrease the severity of illness caused by the virus. It can also protect against other circulating strains of the virus, which is why the CDC still recommends getting the vaccine. ""The flu is bad, and you want to do anything you can to prevent getting it and to prevent giving it to other people,"" said Dr. Lisa Thebner, a pediatrician in New York City. ""The vaccine isn't perfect, but it's the best protection we have for prevention."" When asked if people should be concerned, Thebner said ""people should always be concerned about the flu."" In a news conference Thursday, Frieden emphasized that if you do start to see flu symptoms -- fever, sore throat, cough, body aches -- it's extremely important to begin taking antiviral medications as soon as possible.  Tamiflu and Relenza have been considered most effective at reducing complications when given soon after symptoms begin. However, he said, most doctors still do not treat people with the antiviral medications, noting that fewer than 1 in 6 people who are severely ill with flu get them. ""It is very important that we do better,"" Frieden said. Antiviral medications can reduce symptoms, shorten the length of time of the illness, and may keep people out of the hospital. So far this year, five children in the United States have died from the flu, Frieden said. In past years, studies have shown 98% of children who do die from flu have not been vaccinated, but it was not clear if the five children Frieden cited were vaccinated. During the 2012-2013 flu season 12,337 people were hospitalized with flu-related illness and 149 children died, according to CDC surveillance data. Ninety percent of those children were not vaccinated. Overall, flu activity across the country is currently low, according to the latest flu outbreak data from the CDC.","CDC says mutated flu virus means current flu shot is less protective .

"(CNN)An outbreak of the plague has killed dozens in Madagascar, and experts fear those numbers could go up. At least 119 cases were confirmed by late last year,  including 40 deaths, the World Health Organization said in a statement. And the disease is taking an alarming turn. ""The outbreak that started last November has some disturbing dimensions,"" the WHO said this week. ""The fleas that transmit this ancient disease from rats to humans have developed resistance to the first-line insecticide."" It's especially spreading in densely populated slums in the capital of  Antananarivo. Cases were confirmed in at least  20 districts and the capital, Christophe Rogier of the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar said late last year. Rogier is part of a team working with the WHO on the ground to combat the disease. The plague is caused by Yersinia pestis, a bacteria found in rodents and spread by fleas. Recent flooding in the nation has displaced tens of thousands of people and an ""untold numbers of rats,"" leading to fears the disease could spread, said Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization. Once an infected flea bites human beings, they can develop the bubonic plague, which is marked by swollen lymph nodes. If the bacteria reaches the lungs, one can develop pneumonic plague. The pneumonic type is rare but more dangerous than bubonic plague because it can be transmitted between humans through inhalation and coughing. ""If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics,"" the World Health Organization said. ""Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection."" At least 8% of cases advance to pneumonic plague, the WHO said. It's unclear what percentage of the current cases comprise the more lethal plague. Past plague epidemics have have occurred in Europe, the United States, Africa, Asia and South America. The plague was known as the ""Black Death"" in Europe in the 14th century, and led to the deaths of 50 million people, the WHO said.

"(CNN)The burning death filmed, produced and edited on videotape is a watershed moment for ISIS and for the Kingdom of Jordan. It is clear now that ISIS was never going to release Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh, there was never going to be a deal. The hoax of an alternative outcome in exchange for the failed suicide bomber was nothing more than an effort to humiliate Jordan and demonstrate the growing power of the movement. The main objective of such a strategy is simply to widen the base of supporters in the region and inside of Jordan. The CIA says there are between 20,000 and 31,000 ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, and the great majority of these foreign fighters are from Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. There are three messages to understand from today's barbaric footage. First, ISIS is about death or nothing. There is no end game. This is not a movement that wants longevity as their every action is designed to alienate themselves from moderate Muslims and all other decent human beings. Their actions are designed to provoke violent response so that they can achieve martyrdom. There is no focus on expanding and maintaining their territorial boundaries as their external pushes are too infrequent to imply a master strategy and their fighting force, asymmetric and able but too thin to maintain an all-out conflict with the technologically superior western forces. The wider their spread, the weaker their ability to maintain the gains. There are no obvious objectives. The only result they want is more violence as violence is what swells their ranks. Second there is a history between ISIS and Jordan, which has cracked down on the group's supporters, putting many in jail. ISIS started out with al Qaeda in Iraq, whose senior official was the Jordanian, Abu Musaab al Zarqawi. He split from al Qaeda because that group disagreed with his radical approach of even killing moderate Muslims. Zarkawi took his fighters and joined with elements of Al Nusra, which was fighting in Syria, laying the foundation for the creation of the modern-day ISIS. Zarkawi was killed in a U.S.-led strike in June 2006. According to Candyce Kelshall from the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at University of Buckingham ""there is a silent minority of supporters in the country but the majority moderate and outraged population's cry will get louder.  Many don't want Jordan involved in the bombing campaign against ISIL [alternative name for ISIS]. This will cause cracks within the country. ""There is no underestimating the anger in Jordan over this. People want vengeance. Lt. Kaseasbeh came from a powerful family and a powerful clan within Jordan. This cannot be underestimated in terms of Jordan's next steps.""  Jordan is a strong US ally and it would be inconceivable that the US is not going to respond to this in some capacity. The third message is a lesson taken from Somalia. Pirates in that lawless country were able to terrorize the East African waters because the world allowed it. Violence by the pirates became normalized and the west accepted the increased business and financial risk. Only when a focused crackdown was put in place did the success of piracy abate, however, as soon as the ships move, piracy will see a resurgence. This is the problem we face now with ISIS. Sending troops or assistance, or technical advisers or funding or weapons will only work so long as that assistance is maintained. Kelshall adds ""what we appease we allow. What we fight we make stronger ideologically. ISIL needs to be wiped out but it is the idea that their behavior is acceptable that must be wiped out. An eye for an eye will only consume the whole body, eventually."" Killing the idea that we accept this barbarism is the mission that must be embraced. There will be a response.","Every action by ISIS designed to alienate moderate Muslims and decent human beings, writes Zain Verjee .
Verjee: Only result they want is more violence as violence is what swells their ranks .

"Police around the United States are recording the license plates of passing drivers and storing the information for years with little privacy protection, the American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday. The information potentially allows authorities to track the movements of everyone who drives a car. The ACLU documented the police surveillance after reviewing 26,000 pages of material gathered through public records requests to almost 600 local and state police departments in 38 states and the District of Columbia. Opinion: Supreme Court must protect our privacy from the government . Police are gathering the vehicle information with surveillance technology called automatic license plate readers, and it's being stored -- sometimes indefinitely -- with few or no privacy protections, the ACLU said. ""The documents paint a startling picture of a technology deployed with too few rules that is becoming a tool for mass routine location tracking and surveillance,"" the ACLU said in a written statement. The license plate readers alert police to an automobile associated with an investigation, ""but such instances account for a tiny fraction of license plate scans, and too many police departments are storing millions of records about innocent drivers,"" the ACLU said. After the crash: License, registration, cellphone, please . ""Private companies are also using license plate readers and sharing the information they collect with police with little or no oversight or privacy protections. A lack of regulation means that policies governing how long our location data is kept vary widely,"" the ACLU said. The civil liberties group is advocating legislation regulating the use of the technology. The readers have been proliferating at ""worrying speed"" and are typically mounted on bridges, overpasses and patrol cars, the ACLU said. The devices use high-speed cameras, and the software analyzes the photographs to retrieve the plate number, the group said. Lawsuit by 19 groups seeks to halt NSA snooping . The system then runs the data against ""hot lists"" of plate numbers and produces an instant alert when a match, or ""hit,"" registers, the group said. The hot lists include the National Crime Information Center ﬁle, which includes stolen cars and vehicles used in the commission of a crime. ""License plate readers would pose few civil liberties risks if they only checked plates against hot lists and these hot lists were implemented soundly. But these systems are conﬁgured to store the photograph, the license plate number, and the date, time, and location where all vehicles are seen — not just the data of vehicles that generate hits,"" the ACLU report said. The growing collection of data allows police to create ""a single, high-resolution image of our lives,"" and the constant monitoring ""can chill the exercise of our cherished rights to free speech and association,"" the group said. ""If not properly secured, license plate reader databases open the door to abusive tracking, enabling anyone with access to pry into the lives of his boss, his ex-wife, or his romantic, political, or workplace rivals,"" the ACLU said. Law enforcement argues the tools keep officers and the public safe. In a blog post last week, the Los Angeles Police Protective League said that license plate recognition (LPR) technology has helped with ""literally thousands of cases nationwide."" ""LPR is not an invasion of privacy, but rather a tool for law enforcement to better accomplish its mission to protect and serve. The onus is on law enforcement agencies and governing bodies to ensure that they have proper policies in place for disciplined and responsible use, with appropriate punishments for anyone operating outside of policy,"" the union said. The ACLU report cited how the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2012 tracked the movement of the Mayor R.T. Rybak's car 41 times at a license police reader in the prior year. The newspaper put the information on a map and gathered the data through public records requests. The newspaper found that the police department's plate readers yielded hits of fewer than 1% of the 805,000 plate scans made in June 2012, according to the ACLU. A hit means that a read matched a listing in a database of vehicles law enforcement was interested in, for whatever reason. They might be reported stolen, for instance, or belonging to missing persons. As a result, the mayor directed the police chief to recommend a new policy on data retention, the group said.","Union says technology helps to keep officers and the public safe .
Police around country track every vehicle passing a license plate reader .
The readers are surveillance technology using high speed cameras .

"Ryan Ferguson, vindicated in the murder of a Missouri newspaper editor, said Wednesday he holds few grudges against an old pal whose bogus testimony landed him in prison for a decade. In fact, he said, Charles Erickson should be a free man, too. The 29-year-old conceded he has some hard feelings toward Erickson -- after all, his 20s were taken from him -- but when asked whether he bore ill will toward the former classmate with whom he was drinking the night of the murder, he flatly called for Erickson's release. ""He's not a murderer. He's been taken advantage of by those in the justice system,"" Ferguson said. Having served roughly a quarter of his 40-year sentence, Ferguson refused to speculate on whether prosecutors acted maliciously -- despite that two of the prosecution's key witnesses later recanted their damning testimony and an appeals court judge ruled that prosecutors withheld evidence at trial. ""They've taken my 20s, and I'll never have that back. ... Those are amazing years, obviously,"" he said. ""I've never really lived as an adult in the free world."" The Jefferson City Correctional Center released Ferguson on Tuesday after Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said he wouldn't retry Ferguson. Ferguson and Erickson, both 17 at the time, were drinking illegally at a college bar early on November 1, 2001. About five blocks away, Columbia Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt turned off his computer after a late night and walked out to the newspaper parking lot shortly after 2 a.m., according to court documents. Heitholt was struck from behind and strangled with his own belt, according to the documents. Police found hair, blood and fingerprints at the scene, and a police dog tracked a scent to a University of Missouri dorm, according to a website devoted to Ferguson's defense. Police questioned a janitor, Jerry Trump, who said he could not identify the individuals involved in the crime, court documents say. More than two years later, Erickson told police he had ""dream-like"" memories of committing the crime, resulting in his and Ferguson's March 2004 arrest. Ferguson told police that he recalled driving Erickson home that night before going home himself, according to the documents. Erickson implicated Ferguson at trial, as did Trump, who had gone to prison himself on a parole violation the month after the murder. Trump testified that a newspaper article his wife sent him in prison in early 2004 jogged his memory about what he saw that night, court documents say. That testimony was key to Ferguson's release, because prosecutors had interviewed Trump's wife, who denied sending him the article. Prosecutors failed to disclose that interview, and Judge Cynthia Martin, in a summary of last week's decision, wrote, ""The undisclosed interview was material, resulting in a verdict that was not worthy of confidence."" Ferguson found out he would be released when his lawyer came to the prison, holding up a piece of paper behind the protective glass that separates visitors from inmates. On it, she had quickly scrawled two words: ""It's over."" ""I feel like Jay Leno or something,"" Ferguson said to supporters after his release. He said his first stop as a free man might be at a Dairy Queen, and the profile photo on the Free Ryan Ferguson Facebook site was later updated to show a grinning Ferguson in a gray V-neck sweater, sitting at a bar with a beer and a steak. Now that he's out, Ferguson said he and his legal team will be looking into the prosecution's conduct in the case. He also said it was ""incredibly important"" to him that Heitholt's killer be found. ""I believe we know who did it. It's a matter of proving it and getting help from authorities at this point,"" he said, declining to name names. ""I think the facts show clearly who did it."" It's unclear if Ferguson is entitled to any compensation for his incarceration. Missouri law says wrongly incarcerated people are entitled to restitution, but only if they're determined to be ""actually innocent"" as a result of DNA analysis. Though court documents say none of the DNA at the crime scene matched Ferguson or Erickson, the judge cited only the witness's wife's interview in overturning Ferguson's conviction. ""The individual may receive an amount of fifty dollars per day for each day of post-conviction incarceration for the crime for which the individual is determined to be actually innocent,"" the statute says. Ferguson attributed his grace in this difficult time to his upbringing. While in prison, he read, studied and took care of himself while ""preparing for my life"" and never allowing himself to ""look too far into the future,"" he said previously. He added Wednesday that his confidence in his own innocence also helped him survived his decade in prison. ""I believe in myself. I know what I've done in my life. I know what's right and wrong. ... I knew someday I would prove my innocence,"" he said. ""I just kept moving forward.""","Ryan Ferguson, 29, released after serving quarter of 40-year sentence for murder, robbery .

"A law enforcement officer's quick decision is once again being put under a microscope. On Monday, Cleveland police said officers fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice as the youth reached for an air pistol in his waist. Chief Calvin Williams said the air pistol was ""indistinguishable from a real firearm."" An orange tip indicating the gun was not a real firearm had been removed, police said. ""Our officers at times are required to make critical decisions in a split second,"" Williams said at a news conference ""Unfortunately, this was one of those times."" The incident comes as the nation nervously awaits a grand jury decision on whether to charge the police officer who killed African-American teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August. But Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said events in Ferguson don't concern him. ""Ferguson being out there or not being out there doesn't matter,"" the mayor said at the news conference. ""This is about the fact that a young boy was shot and killed in Cleveland."" The attorney for the family of the Cleveland youngster, who also was black, downplayed any possible racial connotations to the shooting. Police have not disclosed the race of the officer who shot Tamir. ""This is not a black and white issue. This is a right and wrong issue,"" attorney Tim Kucharski said. Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said video showing the Saturday shooting exists, but he didn't say where the video comes from. He said representatives for Rice's family have viewed the video and the family will decide later whether to look at it. Tomba said the video is not available for journalists now because it's part of an active investigation, which the department plans to complete in 90 days and send to the district attorney. 'There's a guy in there with a pistol' The incident began Saturday when police were summoned to a city recreation center by a 911 caller who said someone -- possibly a juvenile -- was pointing ""a pistol""  at people. ""There's a guy in there with a pistol, you know, it's probably fake, but he's like pointing it at everybody,"" the caller said. ""He's sitting on a swing right now, but he's pulling it in and out of his pants and pointing it at people,"" the caller said. ""He's probably a juvenile, you know?"" Police said it's not clear if the responding officers received the information about the age of the suspect or the gun being ""probably fake."" When the two officers arrived, the boy did not point the air gun at them or otherwise threaten them, Tomba told reporters Sunday. But he did reach for the air gun, Tomba said. ""The officers ordered him to stop and to show his hands, and he went into his waistband and pulled out the weapon,"" he said. Tamir died early Sunday at MetroHealth Medical Center after surgery, according to the hospital and the family's attorney. Tomba showed reporters the air gun the boy was said to be reaching for -- a large, black BB- or pellet-type replica gun resembling a semiautomatic pistol. An orange tip indicating the gun was not a real firearm had been removed, police said. On Monday, Williams said that the ""facsimile weapon in this incident was indistinguishable from a real firearm."" Both officers have been placed on leave, police said. The head of the police union said the officers followed protocols. ""As they approached the male, they are screaming at him, 'Put your hands up, put your hands up' -- they don't want his hands to go anywhere down by the waistband,"" Cleveland Police Patrolman's Association President Jeff Follmer told CNN affiliate WJW. ""I can tell you the officer that fired had no clue that he was 12, he just thought it was an older male. There was more concentration on his hands because we are taught in the academy that hands will kill you,"" Follmer told the station. 'It was a child' Residents reacted angrily. ""It wasn't a dog. It was a child. You didn't give him a chance. You just killed him,"" one man told CNN affiliate WEWS. Someone claiming to represent the online activist group Anonymous claimed in a YouTube video to have taken down the city's website, blaming the shooting on what the speaker said was ""an overzealous rookie officer"" who resorted too quickly to lethal force. ""Officers are equipped with many nonlethal options such as Taser guns,"" the speaker said. ""Why did he not use a Taser on this child? Shooting him in cold blood was not necessary with these nonlethal options available."" However, Follmer said officers had no way to know the air gun wasn't a real firearm. ""You feel bad, after the fact, that it was a 12-year-old,"" he said. ""Nobody wants to shoot a 12-year-old, especially when they are holding a fake gun. But that's not the perception the officers had at that time."" Chief Williams said parents need to teach children that ""guns are not toys,"" whether they're real or fake. Police shootings of African-Americans, particularly young men, have been under rising scrutiny in recent months after Brown's shooting following a brief confrontation in Ferguson. A grand jury there is expected to soon make a decision whether Officer Darren Wilson should face criminal charges in that incident, which resulted in widespread protests over police violence against African-Americans.","An orange tip indicating the gun was not a real firearm had been removed, police said .

"(CNN) -- Maybe it was the sound of the wind cutting through the wire. Perhaps he caught a small vibration with his keen eyes. Or it could have been a slight difference in the air's smell. Whatever it was, when Sarge noticed that his Marine Corps handler, Fred Dorr, was creeping down the wrong path in the Vietnam jungle, the German shepherd did something he'd never done out in the field: He looked at Dorr and barked, before taking a seat. ""When he sat down, I knew there was a trip wire. I was one step away from it,"" remembered Dorr, who with his dog in 1969 was ""walking point,"" leading the way for a dozen soldiers. Had the hidden explosive device been tripped, ""It would have gotten half of us."" More than 40 years later, the gratitude and love Dorr, 59, feels for the dog he served with is as strong as ever. And it's for this reason that Dorr, president of the Vietnam Dog Handler Association, drove from his Yoakum, Texas, home to be in Southern California this week. About 200 Vietnam War dog handlers, who were trained to read and communicate with their canine partners, have gathered for a reunion. And on Saturday they'll join an expected several thousand others for the 10th anniversary rededication of the War Dog Memorial at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside. During the Vietnam War, more than 4,000 dogs served in various positions, said Michael Lemish, a military dog historian and author of ""Forever Forward: K-9 Operations in Vietnam."" The scout dogs, such as Sarge, walked with their handlers ahead of patrols -- making them the first target for ambushes or hidden explosives. There were also sentry dogs who guarded bases, tracker dogs who followed the trail of enemies and mine and booby trap dogs who sniffed out dangers hidden beneath the ground. The Viet Cong placed a bounty on the dogs because they were so effective, Lemish said. All told, he estimated the K-9 teams averted more than 10,000 casualties. But at the end of the war, only about 200 dogs came home. The rest who had survived were either euthanized or turned over to the South Vietnamese -- left behind, a surplus of war. ""They were treated as obsolete equipment. And if you were a handler, you couldn't see them that way,"" said Jack Kowall, 61, who keeps a framed picture of himself and Eric, the black lab and shepherd mix he worked with, atop his desk in Marietta, Georgia. ""When that's your dog, that's your dog. He sees you in danger, he's going to respond. Unconditional love -- it's all for you. You can't help but love him."" On patrols, Kowall used hand motions to speak to Eric. In turn, the animal spoke back through his movements. His ears would shoot up and turn in the direction of suspicious noise. The hair on his back would stand up if danger was close. If he wanted Kowall to stop moving, he'd look back at him. Off-duty, Eric was playful. He liked to have his neck scratched and would roll around on the ground. The  110-pound dog would cuddle up to Kowall at night when they were out in the field, and he'd eat out of his handler's helmet. Whenever Kowall could, he'd give his closest friend steak. The men who'd walk behind the pair on missions were always different. But a scout handler and his dog were a constant, as the duo bounced between different assignments. When Jeffrey Bennett, founder and former CEO of Nature's Recipe pet foods, first learned about the dogs who'd served and the fate of so many of them, he set out to teach others. Based on about three years of research, he co-produced the documentary ""War Dogs: America's Forgotten Heroes,"" which first aired 11 years ago on the Discovery Channel. Donations earned through this film allowed Bennett, now president of the War Dog Memorial, to commission three monuments, sculptures featuring a German shepherd and his handler. The first one was unveiled at the March Field Air Museum in Riverside. A second was installed at Fort Benning, Georgia. The third remains in storage, Bennett said. The original goal to place it in Washington beside the Vietnam Veterans Memorial or at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia remains an elusive dream. Dogs have long served with the U.S. military, said Lemish, who also wrote ""War Dogs: A History of Loyalty and Heroism."" During World War I, the dogs borrowed from the French and British worked as messengers and assisted the Red Cross by finding the wounded on battlefields, he said. The American K-9 corps, Lemish said, really began during World War II, when, among other tasks, thousands of dogs donated by civilians patrolled shorelines. Back then, dogs sent abroad were retrained and returned to civilian life, but that practice had changed by the time U.S. forces entered Vietnam, Lemish said. Later, galvanized by the attention earned through the documentary, Vietnam War dog handlers began to call for change. Johnny Mayo, 60, hadn't spoken to another dog handler in 30 years when he showed up in Washington for his first reunion in 2000. But as he talked to the 250 others in attendance, he realized the power of what they shared. ""You go through the war, and you always remember the bond you have, the bond with the dog,"" said Mayo, whose dog Kelly once yanked him up a bank from a rice paddy, out of the way of mortar fire. ""On that first trip to the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial] wall, it was a reunion with the spirits of our dogs."" Later, Mayo, of Lexington, South Carolina, would go on to write his own book and establish a traveling exhibit to pay tribute to the dogs who'd served. Washington also took notice. In November 2000, President Clinton signed into law legislation that established a military working dog adoption program. Now the dogs working in Iraq and Afghanistan will have a chance to find comfortable homes when they return from war. For Dorr, of the Vietnam Dog Handler Association, this has been a blessing. He said leaving his partner Sarge behind, all those decades ago, haunted him. ""A lot of us [handlers] suffered PTSD,"" he said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder. ""It's like leaving your kid back there."" But he now has Bluma, the war dog he adopted from Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The German shepherd, who has hip problems, looks uncannily like Sarge, he said, and having him around is a source of comfort. ""I'm taking care of an old vet,"" Dorr said, ""and he's taking care of me.""","Several thousand people will gather Saturday at a War Dog Memorial in California .

"One state has found a way to significantly reduce teen pregnancy rates. But is its solution realistic for the rest of the United States? Colorado's teen birth rate dropped 40% between 2009 and 2013, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced this week, in part due to a program that provides long-acting contraception to low-income women. Colorado's Family Planning Initiative provided funding for 68 family clinics across the state to offer around 30,000 intrauterine devices and implants to young women at low or no cost. An IUD is a small T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a doctor. They're either wrapped in copper or contain hormones, which kill sperm and make the uterine lining too thin for egg implantation. Because IUDs stay in place for five to 10 years, they're easier to comply with than taking daily birth control pills. An anonymous donor funded the $23 million initiative, which also provided training, outreach and technical assistance to clinics statewide. The state health department conducted a study, to be published in the fall issue of Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, to analyze the program's impact. It found that the low-cost IUDs were a significant factor in the state's overall decrease in teen births. The percentage of young women receiving IUDs and implants quadrupled in participating clinics, according to the study. From 2008 to 2012, Colorado went from having the 29th lowest teen birthrate in the nation to having the 19th lowest. Written by health department staff members, the study says the decline in births from young women served by these clinics accounted for about 75% of the overall decrease in the state's teen birthrates. St. Louis, Missouri, implemented a similar program in 2007, providing 10,000 teenage girls with their choice of free birth control. A year later, the teen pregnancy rate in Missouri was significantly lower than the national average. Colorado's study included more women over a longer period of time, demonstrating the possible longer-term implications of providing free birth control. The teen birthrate overall in the United States is at a record low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2009, the national teen birthrate was 13.5 births for every 1,000 teens; in 2013, preliminary data put it at 12.5 -- a drop of about 7.5%. In 2010 alone, Colorado saved $42 million on health care costs associated with teen births, thanks to the program, according to a press release from the governor's office. ""Our Colorado Family Planning Initiative has helped thousands of young women who weren't ready to have children avoid pregnancy with affordable, safe and effective contraceptives,"" said Dr. Larry Wolk, department executive director and chief medical officer. Seven out of 10 teen pregnancies in Colorado are unplanned, which can carry health risks for both the mother and child and increases the rate of elective abortions. The health department said that teen abortion rates during the study time period also decreased 35%. Colorado's funding for the initiative only runs through 2015, so despite its very promising results, its future is uncertain. While the program's success is certainly encouraging, it would be difficult to implement in other states due to the substantial cost. But the study authors say the initiative serves as a model for family planning coverage under the Affordable Care Act. ""By showing the effectiveness of long-acting, reversible contraceptives, we're providing the evidence needed for health plans ... to cover family planning services,"" said a spokesman for the Colorado health department. Study: IUD may carry higher risk for breast cancer in certain women . Study: IUDs, implants vastly more effective than the pill . Study: '16 and Pregnant' led to fewer teen births .","Teen births in Colorado dropped 40% in the last 5 years .

"A band of rogue Philadelphia police officers allegedly held a drug suspect over the balcony railing of his 18th-floor apartment as an interrogation technique, federal prosecutors say. In another instance, according to prosecutors, the six officers allegedly kidnapped a drug suspect and kept him in a hotel room for days while threatening his family. In what Philadelphia's police commissioner described as one of the worst cases of corruption, the six officers were arrested Wednesday on a range of charges, including conspiracy, robbery, extortion, kidnapping and drug dealing. The case centers on a six-year scheme in which they allegedly pocketed $500,000 in drugs, cash and personal property, including Rolex watches and designer suits, authorities said. The officers -- identified as Thomas Liciardello, 38; Brian Reynolds, 43; Michael Spicer, 46; Perry Betts, 46; Linwood Norman, 46; and John Speiser, 44 -- were arrested at their homes, authorities said. They were members of Philadelphia Police Department's narcotics field unit. Attempts to contact the officers for comment were unsuccessful. It was unclear whether they have hired lawyers. The arrests came after a nearly two-year joint investigation by the FBI, federal prosecutors and Philadelphia Police internal affairs unit, said U.S.  Attorney Zane David Memeger said. The suspects were named in a 42-page indictment unsealed on Wednesday. ""I have been a police officer for more than 40 years, and this is one of the worst cases of corruption that I have ever heard,"" Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters. Memeger said the officers allegedly engaged in an array of criminal activities, including beatings, threats to shoot a suspect, entering homes without warrants for the purpose of stealing money and drugs, and the distribution of narcotics. ""The reprehensible conduct alleged to have been committed by the six charged officers tarnishes the badge held by the thousands of officers who currently serve -- and have previously served -- this city with distinction,"" Memeger told reporters. The officers often filed false police reports to conceal their activities, Memeger said. Investigators used information provided by Jeffrey Walker, a former member of the narcotics unit, to build a case against the officers, Ramsey said. In May 2013, Walker was arrested on charges of robbery, extortion and using his position as a police officer to commit criminal acts, according to a criminal complaint. Walker pleaded guilty to robbery charges and will be sentenced on November 4, according to Patty Hartman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office. He faces up to 10 years in prison. Investigators corroborated information provided by Walker to indict the six officers, authorities said. The six officers were pulled off the street and removed from narcotics investigations after the district Attorney's Office informed the police commissioner that their testimony could no longer be used in cases, Ramsey said. The officers were not fired at the time in an effort to avoid jeopardizing the ongoing investigation, Ramsey said. The Philadelphia District Attorney's Office is reviewing previous convictions involving the six officers, according to a statement. The office said it has no open cases involving Liciardello, Reynolds, Spicer, Betts and Speiser at this time. Cases involving Norman will be reviewed for the relevant period. If convicted, the officers could face between 40 years and life in prison, according to Memeger.

"During the height of the 2009 financial crisis, when there was a real and present danger of banks seizing up due to a lack of liquidity, the then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown altered the geopolitical architecture. Brown moved with a sense of urgency to formalize the Group of 20 nations. The strategy was sound. He wanted to bring countries representing 80% of GDP under one umbrella, bridge the gap between the developed and the developing world and, most importantly, tap the $4 trillion of surplus funds that still exist within the BRICS economies. In the context of a financial crisis, the strategy worked. Four years later, however, geopolitics is trumping economics. The G20 has become an unwieldy group of countries with different priorities, and without political backing from Washington. According to Brown, who I interviewed earlier this year, America ""should actually be more alert to the possibilities of international cooperation in both trade and agreements for growth.""

Brazil and Indonesia have seen their currencies tumble 10%, requiring central banks to use currency reserves and in some cases interest rate hikes to stop the bleeding.

"In a $40 million federal lawsuit, five people arrested recently in Ferguson, Missouri, accuse police of using ""wanton and excessive force"" and treating U.S. citizens ""as if they were war combatants."" A complaint filed Thursday alleges that police officers from Ferguson and St. Louis County used unnecessary force and made unjustified arrests as they cracked down on protests after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown earlier this month. The lawsuit lists Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, Ferguson officer Justin Cosma, several unnamed officers and the city and county governments as defendants. A St. Louis County police spokesman declined to comment Friday, referring inquiries to the county prosecuting attorney's office. The St. Louis County prosecuting attorney's office told CNN it has no comment on the lawsuit. The suit -- which includes accusations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, and assault and battery -- details circumstances allegedly surrounding several arrests between August 11-13: . -- Tracey White was about to buy an ice cream sundae at McDonald's when officers ""in what appeared to be army uniforms, carrying rifles and sticks and wearing helmets"" entered and ordered her to leave, according to the lawsuit. She was told to shut up, thrown to the ground and handcuffed after criticizing officers for the way they were treating her son, the lawsuit claims. -- Dewayne Matthews was walking to his mother's house when a group of officers in military uniforms shot rubber bullets at him, the lawsuit alleges. He fell into a creek or sewer, the suit says, where officers ""pounced on him, slammed his face into the concrete, and pushed his head into the water to the point that he felt he was going to be drowned."" -- Kerry White was shooting footage and holding his camera out his car window when an officer snatched his camera, ""took out his memory card and threw it to the ground,"" the lawsuit says. -- Damon Coleman and Theophilus Green were peacefully protesting, the lawsuit says, when police in riot gear fired tear gas and what appeared to be stun grenades in their direction, then ""hurled racial epithets at them, while punching and kicking them the entire time."" CNN has not independently confirmed details of the arrests. Police tactics to calm the crowds drew sharp criticism, including a rebuke from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. ""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder said as the protests unfolded. As criticism of police tactics mounted, Gov. Jay Nixon Missouri tapped State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson to head up security in Ferguson on August 14. This week, Johnson said police were scaling back their efforts in Ferguson now that the situation has cooled. Belmar, the St. Louis County Police Chief, told reporters on Wednesday that he doesn't regret his agency's decisions to fire tear gas at protesters. That approach, he said, was much better than using nightsticks or dogs. Even though President Barack Obama has called for a review of military equipment sales to local police departments in light of the clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Belmar said that such equipment is often necessary. ""I never envisioned a day that we would ever see that kind of equipment used against protesters,"" he said. ""But I also never imagined a day in 28 years when we would see that kind of criminal activity spin out of peaceful demonstrations.""

"The flu hasn't hit Europe as hard as it has the United States, health officials say, but when and if it does, don't expect a call for vaccination of the entire population. Only the U.S. and Canada actually encourage everyone older than 6 months to get the flu vaccine. Apparently, not a single country in Europe asks the general population to seek that same kind of protection, according to Robb Butler, the World Health Organization technical officer in vaccine preventable diseases and immunizations in the organization's Europe office in the Netherlands. That's because global health experts say the data aren't there yet to support this kind of blanket vaccination policy, nor is there enough money. In fact, some scientists say the enthusiasm for mass vaccination in the United States may hurt efforts to create a better vaccine. This year, a year in which the vaccine is supposed to be a good match to the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the vaccine is only 62% effective. And in the segments of the population that are most susceptible to the extreme effects of the flu -- like the elderly, who make up the majority of the cases of flu-related deaths -- the vaccinations are even less effective. So is why is everyone urged to get vaccinated? Three things we don't know about the flu . Simply put, it's a clearer policy, and some protection is better than none at all, according to Dr. William Schaffner, the chair of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. He was also on the national committee that made the decision to encourage everyone to get vaccinated. ""It was debated by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for many years, and the indication for the use of influenza vaccine for an increasing number of groups on a piecemeal basis didn't make sense,"" Schaffner said. In 2010, the CDC expanded its guidance encouraging the vaccination of vulnerable population groups. ""When you do the back-of-the-envelope calculations (of all the separate groups recommended for vaccination), you are actually already making a recommendation that 75% of the population get it,"" Schaffner said. ""And when it became apparent the issue of shortages was largely put on the back burner, then in 2010, we said, 'Let's simplify this and recommended this vaccine for anyone over 6 months old.'"" Regulators approve new insect-based flu vaccine . It also helps that the flu vaccine is easy to get, he said. Pharmacies offer it. Companies sometimes bring in nurses to give shots to their employees on site. In Europe, only doctors are legally allowed to administer the vaccine, according to Butler. There may be another economic reason for more Americans to get vaccinated -- one in three U.S. workers get no paid time off when they are sick, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Generally, Europeans have much more generous sick leave policies. ""Although flu can be unpleasant, if you are otherwise healthy, the illness will usually clear up on its own and you will recover within a week,"" according to Britain's National Health Service website. Homemade survival kits battle the flu . In a contrast to U.S. policy, the World Health Organization recommends only six ""priority populations"" get ""the flu jab,"" as it's called in Britain. These six groups are nursing home residents, people with chronic medical conditions like asthma, the elderly, pregnant women, health care workers, and children from ages 6 months to 2 years, Butler said. They are more vulnerable to the severe effects of the flu or come into contact more often with this highly contagious virus. ""We think the recommendations we have right now (are) a good start,"" Butler said. ""Universal campaigns are quite challenging and expensive. ""We have 53 countries in our region that all have different recommendations based on different studies and evidence, and the depth of evidence in Europe right now is pretty limited in terms of flu vaccines. We would need more evidence that more than these six key, target high-risk groups that are prioritized can benefit. "" Online speculation says the U.S. call for general vaccination is merely a plot by drug companies to make a big profit. Flu vaccine poses no risk to unborn . Shaffner says he hears that a lot, but it's simply not true. ""I have received e-mails after people hear me encourage people to get the influenza vaccine, and they tell me I'm part of some sort of pharmacy company conspiracy and that I'm compromised by them. But influenza vaccines are not real blockbuster money-making drugs,"" Shaffner said. ""If I could take some of these skeptics and bring them to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, they would see how carefully the members debate these issues -- and it really is all for the benefit of the children and adults to prevent infectious diseases."" Influenza: By the numbers . Michael Osterholm, director of the Minnesota Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance at the University of Minnesota, believes people should get the vaccine, but he worries that the current policy gives the impression the vaccine is more effective than it actually is. ""This enthusiasm to get more people vaccinated gets in the way of a critical look at the science,"" Osterholm said. Osterholm co-authored ""The Compelling Need for Game-Changing Influenza Vaccines,"" which came out last October. It is an exhaustive study of this country's vaccine war on flu. The authors examined more than 12,000 articles, studies and transcripts dating back to 1936 and interviewed 88 experts on the influenza vaccine. What they found was that there were some seasons in which the vaccination offers more protection than others, but ultimately, even in good years, the flu shot only offers moderate protection -- a ""pooled estimate of 59% for healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, inconsistent evidence of protection in children age 2 to 17 years, and a paucity of evidence for protection in adults 65 years of age and older."" For the nasal spray form of the vaccine, there is evidence of high protection for children aged 6 months to 7 years, inconsistent evidence of protection in adults 60 years of age and older, and a lack of evidence of protection in individuals between 8 and 59 years of age, the study says. That analysis shows significantly less effectiveness than what has been the conventional  wisdom within the scientific community, Osterholm said. ""In promoting vaccination, it became a mantra that it was 70 to 90% effective across all ages completely, and that wasn't true,"" Osterholm said. Historically, this expansion in policy over who should get vaccinated was based on ""professional judgment and not on scientifically sound data,"" he said. Had a flu shot? You'll be OK --maybe . Osterholm's study suggests this has been a general pattern in American public health history with relation to the flu vaccine. ""There is a real downside to the promotion (of the current flu vaccine), as it dampens serious investment and shuts down any real interest in start-ups to create a more effective vaccine,"" Osterholm said. ""There is a sense that a 59% match is better than zero, but we wouldn't accept this with a disease like measles, which we seem to take more seriously."" The vaccine, however, is improving, according to Schaffner. ""Researchers are trying to make a genuinely better vaccine, including a universal vaccine that could combat all the different strains of flu that we could get every 10 years, as opposed to needing one annually,"" Schaffner said. ""So cross your fingers. All of us wish we had a better vaccine. We know what we have is good, but not perfect. Until we have one, we have to do as much good as possible by vaccinating as many people as possible -- and in the meantime I'll be watching the universal vaccine trials very carefully."" Flu shot myths addressed .","The U.S. and Canada are the only countries to suggest vaccinating nearly everyone .
This year's flu vaccine is only 62% effective.
Some worry that enthusiasm for the vaccine stops progress on more effective ones ."

"(CNN)There was some good news this week. The New York state attorney general's office has told four major retailers --Walmart, GNC, Target and Walgreens -- to cease sales of their store-branded herbal supplements because their products do not actually contain the herbs purportedly listed on their labels. These herbal supplements contain mostly fillers and in some cases potential allergens. But other supplements are more worrisome. As a nutrition expert, I am horrified by the daily barrage of outrageous and unsubstantiated claims touting cures from everything from E. coli to Ebola. If you do a Web search on just about any disease, you will find carefully worded ads promoting unproven nutritional therapies. Worse, some of these can be harmful. For example, people have suffered liver damage from green tea extract that is so severe that they have needed a liver transplant. And the frequency of harm from dietary supplements is on the rise. Dietary supplements are not miracle pills. Extremely few of the claims are supported by good science, even when the substance on the label is actually in the bottle (which we've learned we don't know for sure), and many others have been proven ineffective. Fortunately, some recent developments are heartening. The Federal Trade Commission won a settlement against NourishLife, LLC and its owner, Mark Nottoli, who shamefully claimed that the company's dietary supplements, which are mostly fish oil, will treat speech problems in autistic children. The FTC also won a large settlement against Lindsey Duncan and Pure Health, LLC. This company is infamous for promoting its green tea product as a weight loss miracle by sending paid spokespeople disguised as objective experts to appear on ""The Dr. Oz Show."" The outrageousness of these claims knows no bounds. And there are no bounds since the law that regulates the industry, the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act of 1994, took all control and oversight of these products away from the Food and Drug Administration. Powerful politicians, in partnership with the supplement industry, created ad campaigns so effective that more people wrote to Congress in support of the bill than wrote about the Vietnam War. As a result, there is little regulation of anything called a dietary supplement.  It is left mostly to the FTC to prosecute companies for fraud for their unsubstantiated claims about supplements. These companies are crafty in how they make their claims when the health effect, and safety, of their supplements are unproven. But those of us in the health community are at least in part to blame for the confusion that drives the enormous market for alternative medicine. First, we contradict ourselves every time we issue a new set of guidelines. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issues new dietary guidelines approximately every five years.  Since the 1980s, there have been the Food Wheel, the Food Guide Pyramid, the MyPyramid Food Guidance System and MyPlate. Each of these guidelines has substantially changed how we are supposed to think about our diets. The Department of Agriculture plans to publish another guideline next year. And there are dozens of additional dietary guidelines published every year by professional organizations on everything from preventing cancer to controlling diabetes. Flooded with all of these different guidelines, consumers may feel overwhelmed and think that health experts do not have all the answers, hence they turn to health fads and supplements. Second, there are no controls in place, where supplements are concerned, to regulate how we might be biased by conflicts of interest. This is illegal when it comes to pharmaceuticals. Not so with supplements. For example, Duncan of Pure Health, LLC claimed to be a nutrition expert despite having no credible education or degree to support it. Currently, he is being sued by the Texas attorney general on allegations of falsely representing himself as a doctor. The authors and supporters of nutritional quackery are often quick to claim that there is little potential harm.  After all, we are talking about nutrients. We all need nutrients, so of course they are safe, right? The magical thinking that nutrients or herbs that we take into our bodies have no potential for harm often goes unchallenged. But we have seen time and again that nutritional interventions that sound great can turn out to be harmful. For example, in large randomized trials, beta carotene increases the incidence of lung cancer. In other studies, vitamin E and selenium significantly increased the incidence of prostate cancer. Nutritional science is very complex. If these substances are effective, they are acting as drugs and should be regulated as such. Given the clear potential for harm, and even death, from these unregulated supplements, and the lack of ethics in the absence of strong prohibitions, it is time for better laws. But meanwhile, let the buyers beware.","New York attorney general told retailers to cease store-branded herbal supplement sales .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- This week's Champions League semi-finals are poised to offer a feast of the world's best strikers. Didier Drogba: Is he good enough to be called the best striker in the world? The game's best finishers will face off against each other in the ties involving Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Barcelona. But of all the strikers who is best? The storming return to form for Chelsea's Didier Drogba has certainly pushed his case as the best in the game. The Ivory Coast forward, who had a forgettable first half of the 2008/2009 season, has relished the arrival of Guus Hiddink as temporary manager. He has since proved too good for some of the best sides in Europe.  See our list of the top strikers in the world » . Drogba's Chelsea face Barcelona in their Champions League semi-final -- a match that pits him against Barcelona's potent attacking triumvirate of Samuel Eto'o, Thierry Henry and Lionel Messi. Who do you think is the best striker in the world? Tell what you think of our picks and who should be number one. Eto'o makes a compelling case for himself as the best in the business this season. Having scored 27 league goals to be La Liga's top scorer, the Cameroon striker is in great form and pushing Barca towards the league title. And what about the glittering array of talent at the disposal of Manchester United and Arsenal? Wayne Rooney will once again be crucial to United if they are to retain their European crown. The England striker has been a huge threat this season for both club and country, whether deployed as a striker or pushed out wide. Rooney is ably supported by none other than world player of the year Ronaldo, the club's top scorer, even though he's not really a striker. Arsenal may be out of the running for England's domestic title, but Emmanuel Adebayor and the injured Robin van Persie have fired the Gunners into the last four in Europe's premier club competition. Indeed Adebayor's stunning equalizer against Villarreal in Spain is a contender for goal of the season. Outside of this week's matches in Europe there are still some players who are worthy of consideration. Liverpool's Fernando Torres is undoubtedly one of the best in the game, while it's also tough to look past the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic -- who has helped Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan top Italy's Serie A for much of the season.","CNN's Football Fanzone picks 11 of the world's best strikers .

"(CNN)More African-Americans diagnosed with HIV are living. A report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found an 18% drop in the number of deaths among African-Americans infected with HIV from 2008 to 2012. That is a consistent and promising decline, and yet it still means 8,165 African-American HIV patients lost their lives in 2012, a marked disparity that accounts for nearly half of the 17,166 teens and adults with HIV who died in total that year. Most black HIV patients who died were men who contracted the virus through sexual contact with other men. ""We cannot drop our guard,"" Dr. Eugene McCray, director of the CDC's division of HIV/AIDS prevention, said in a statement. ""HIV is still a serious crisis in our communities. Even though we represent only 12% of the population, more than a third of people living with HIV in the United States are black. And new infections among young, gay black men are increasing at an alarming rate."" Opinion: Time to close HIV's racial disparities . While HIV testing is increasing among African-Americans, new infections are still diagnosed less frequently in blacks compared with whites, the CDC said. The agency also said black HIV patients are less likely to be linked to medical care than any other race. McCray said providing that care and treatment could do more than anything else to keep HIV patients alive and prevent new infections. The report comes just two days before National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, on February 7, which aims to reduce new infections by encouraging HIV testing.

"(CNN)Serena Williams is ending her Indian Wells boycott in a spirit of ""forgiveness"" 14 years after suffering racist abuse at the Californian resort's showpiece tennis tournament. World No.1 Williams, who won the Australian Open with victory over Maria Sharapova in Melbourne last month, announced her decision -- explained in an exclusive interview with TIME magazine -- on Twitter. Back in 2001, age 19, she lifted her second Indian Wells trophy by beating Kim Clijsters -- but she and her family were racially abused by some members of the crowd after sister Venus withdrew from their semifinal with an injury. That sparked accusations from some that their father, Richard, was ""fixing"" games between the two. He later said the abuse the family had suffered during the final ""shamed America."" His daughter told TIME he ""had to sit and watch his daughter being taunted, sparking cold memories of his experiences growing up in the South."" She instantly vowed never to return to the scene of her first-ever professional victory, in a doubles match with Venus in 1997, but revealed that she now felt ready to go back and compete in the BNP Paribas Open, being played in March. ""I'm fortunate to be at a point in my career where I have nothing to prove,"" Williams explained. ""I'm still as driven as ever, but I play for the love of the game. ""It is with that love in mind, and a new understanding of the true meaning of forgiveness, that I will proudly return to Indian Wells in 2015."" The 33-year-old said a feeling that attitudes in tennis had progressed had helped to make up her mind, citing the prompt action taken by the Women's Tennis Association and United States Tennis Association when she and Venus were victims of racist and sexist comments made by a Russian official last year. ""I have thought about going back to Indian Wells many times over my career,"" Williams said. ""I said a few times that I would never play there again. And believe me, I meant it. I admit it scared me. What if I walked onto the court and the entire crowd booed me? The nightmare would start all over."" She said it had been ""difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the Indian Wells locker room after winning in 2001, driving back to Los Angeles feeling as if I had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality."" ""Emotionally it seemed easier to stay away,"" she explained. ""There are some who say I should never go back. There are others who say I should have returned years ago. ""I understand both perspectives very well and wrestled with them for a long time. I'm just following my heart on this one."" Her decision was welcomed by tournament CEO Raymond Moore, who confirmed that she had accepted a wild card for the event. ""We really look forward to watching her compete again,"" he said.","World No. 1 had vowed never to return to scene of her first professional victory .

"Beijing stands as one of the world's most populated cities, with over 21 million people residing in the Chinese capital. Inevitably, this has put huge pressure on transport structures in the city. It took less than 10 years for the number of inhabitants in Beijing to quadruple, and with a population continuously on the rise, taxi services have found it difficult to keep up. Cheng Wei, co-founder and CEO of taxi-hailing app Didi Dache, is on a mission to make travel simple and efficient. ""Our innovation is to redistribute taxi resources using mobile internet."" Says Wei. ""We found that 30% of the time, taxis in China were actually driving around empty."" Launched in September 2012, Didi Dache uses GPS technology to allow users to locate cabs that are nearby on their handheld device. You can send a text to book your taxi, but the app's voice message feature has proven more popular with Chinese users. ""In Chinese cities, unlike in New York or elsewhere, you'll find that addresses are hard to describe in a few words."" mentions Cheng Wei. ""That's why Didi Dache lets you send out your location by voice messages to taxi drivers. People love this function in China. Over 60% of our users adopt it."" he adds. Unsurprisingly, Didi Dache has proven extremely popular in the city and it is currently China's biggest taxi app. The app counts more than three million daily transactions in three Chinese cities. This large uptake is a testament to China's urbanization. ""There are more and more people living in cities now, and the limited number of roads have become a bottleneck of urban development, in addition to the increased number of cars on the road. Despite its success, Wei believes that there is plenty of room to grow, in fact, it seems that Didi Dache has a lot more up its sleeve. ""There are still a lot of transport challenges waiting for solutions in China."" Wei exclaims. ""Our start-up is still young, and the road is long.""

"UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA Moscow after Manchester City's Yaya Toure claimed he was abused by monkey chants from the stands in Wednesday's European Champions League encounter with the Russian club. The Ivorian made his concerns known to the referee and said he was ""furious"" after the Group D game at the Arena Khimki, which City won 2-1. But CSKA released a statement on its website denying there was any racist chanting and told CNN that UEFA's match delegate wasn't aware of any either. European football's governing body UEFA told CNN it had no official comment to make on CSKA's claim. It added that the match delegate or the referee had made reference to the racist chants in their reports in order for proceedings to have been opened. ""Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against PFC CSKA Moskva for racist behavior of their fans and for setting off of fireworks,"" UEFA said in a statement on its website. ""The case will be dealt with by the UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body on October 30."" Toure told Manchester City's in-house TV channel that he was abused after missing a chance during the game, and he called on UEFA to take a tough stance on CSKA. ""I hope they will change it, I hope they will get big sanctions,"" said the midfielder, who played for Ukrainian club Metalurh Donetsk from 2003-05. ""They have to ban them at some stage, they have to ban a club for a couple of years. They don't know. ""They have to do something about it or they will always continue with it. I don't know why we just have this in football -- in volleyball or rugby, we don't have it."" But Toure's version of events was challenged by CSKA, which said its fans were trying to put pressure on City's players with a ""disapproving drone and whistle irrespective of their race."" The statement added: ""Having carefully studied the video recording of the match, we have not found any insults of a racist nature by the CSKA fans towards the visitors, which the match delegate also confirmed after the end of the game."" CSKA also quoted Toure's compatriot Seydou Doumbia as saying: ""I never heard anything of the kind from our fans.  Yes, they noisily support the team and try to put maximum pressure on the opponent, but they don't take the liberty of racist cries/shouts. ""So my fellow Ivory Coast teammate clearly got worked up."" However, a report on Russian news agency RIA Novosti noted that racist chanting is ""commonplace at top-flight Russian league games."" It added: ""But prosecutions are rare and clubs whose fans shout racist insults are usually punished with small fines."" High-profile stars such as Brazilian Roberto Carlos have complained about being taunted with bananas while playing in Russia -- as has another former Anzhi Makhachkala player, Christopher Samba. Last year a group of fans supporting Zenit St. Petersburg launched a ""manifesto"" urging the leading Russian club to not sign black players. Russia has also come under scrutiny ahead of next year's Winter Olympics in Sochi due to new legislation that many see as discriminating against gay people. Its successful bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup came with the promise that it would seek to stamp out racism in domestic football, and the organizing committee has reacted to Toure's suggestion that players might boycott the prestigious tournament. ""The 2018 World Cup in Russia, in particular, can act as a catalyst to positively change the mindsets and behavior across all involved in Russian football over the next four years,"" the 2018 organizers said in a statement to Novosti on Thursday. ""Whilst the alleged incidents are still under investigation by the relevant authorities, it is clear that all over the world a small minority try to ruin the wonderful experience of watching live world-class football for real fans. ""It is worth restating that all stakeholders in Russian football have made it clear that there is absolutely no place for any type of racial discrimination or abuse in our game."" European football has been hit by several incidents of racism this year, beginning in January when Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch during a friendly match between his then club AC Milan and a lower-league Italian side. A Serie A match involving Milan in May was suspended due to abuse of Boateng's former teammate Mario Balotelli. This month the Ukraine national side had to play a World Cup qualifying match with Poland in an empty home stadium due to racist behavior by its supporters during a previous game against San Marino.","CSKA Moscow faces charges over behavior of its fans in match against Manchester City .

"After letting her 7-year-old son walk from their home to a park to play, a Florida mother faces up to five years in jail for child neglect. Nicole Gainey, 34, was arrested on July 26 after her son, Dominic, was found by police alone in a park less than a half-mile from her Port St. Lucie home. On Saturday afternoon, Gainey had given Dominic permission to walk to Sportsman's Park, a route he's familiar with since he uses it to ride his bike to school, her lawyer said. On the way, he passed a public pool, and someone asked him where his mother was. ""They asked me a couple questions, and I got scared, so I ran off to the park and they called the cops,"" Dominic Guerrisi told CNN affiliate WPTV. An officer arrived at the park where Dominic was playing a short time later. ""Dominic checked in with his mom a few minutes before the police came and was getting ready to go home for dinner,"" said Gainey's attorney, John Whitehead, founder of the Virginia-based civil liberties group the Rutherford Institute. He always has a cell phone with him and was wearing it in a case around his neck that his mother had made.  According to Whitehead, the phone had fallen out of his pocket recently and she didn't want him to lose it. When the officer asked Dominic whether his mother knew where he was, the child told him that she did and he'd just spoken to her on the phone, according to the police report. Dominic told the police his name, address and mother's name but wasn't able to answer when asked for his date of birth. He was then driven home. Mom arrested after leaving 9-year-old alone at park . ""When I saw the police cars pull up in my driveway, and the officers started asking me about Dominic, I was frantic to know whether he was OK,"" Gainey told CNN in an e-mail. According to the report, Gainey told the officer that she let her son go to the park alone once or twice a week. The arresting officer said that Gainey had failed to provide her son with care and supervision by allowing him to cross the street and go to the park alone.  According to the report, he told her that there had been recent criminal activity in and around the park and a number of sex offenders lived nearby. Gainey was arrested on a felony child neglect charge and taken to jail, leaving Dominic and her 17-year-old daughter at the house with her boyfriend.  She was released seven hours later on $3,750 bond. The Port St. Lucie Police Department has not responded to requests for comment. As of Thursday afternoon, Gainey's attorney still hadn't received notice of a preliminary hearing.  A representative from the Florida State Attorney told CNN that the case hadn't been assigned to a prosecutor yet. ""This is a small town and a safe area,"" Whitehead said.  ""Nicole knows she's not guilty of anything, and she'll plead that way if it comes to it."" On Wednesday, Gainey met with an employee from the Florida Department of Children and Families who told her the charges would likely be dropped, according to Whitehead. ""I'm really sad about how this has already impacted our family,"" Gainey wrote in an e-mail to CNN.  ""My son is worried that I'll get in trouble if he goes outside. I'm even worried about getting in trouble if I let him walk down my driveway alone."" A number of child neglect arrests are gaining attention nationwide, with some onlookers arguing local authorities are overstepping bounds in arresting parents for childrearing decisions that wouldn't have merited notice a generation ago or which plunge families close to the poverty line into even more dire situations. ""Something has shifted and now we're in the middle of a dangerous societal trend of arresting parents for noncriminal activities,"" Whitehead said. Does leaving kids alone make parents criminals? In early July, Debra Harrell of South Carolina made national news after being arrested after letting her 9-year-old daughter play unattended in a nearby park while she worked. She lost her job at McDonald's but has since gotten it back and regained custody of her child, according to her attorney, Robert Verner Phillips.  She's awaiting trial, and the Department of Social Services case against her is still open. In March, Shanesha Taylor was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona, on two counts of felony child abuse after leaving her two children in her Dodge Durango for about an hour while she interviewed for a job. On July 18, she reached a settlement with the Maricopa County Attorney's Office dismissing her case if she completes a diversion program.  Along with parenting and substance-abuse classes, Taylor is required to establish education and child-care trusts for each of her three children, two of which are still in state custody. Florida's child neglect statute has no age written into the law. Many states do not specify an age at which a child can be legally left at home or allowed to go places alone. This leaves some parents unsure of when it's appropriate or even legal to leave a child unsupervised. The Florida Department of Children and Families said in a statement that people who believe they've witnessed a case of neglect can call a hotline to report it. ""The hotline can be called when a child of any age is without adult supervision or arrangements appropriate for the child's age or mental or physical condition, so that the child is unable to care for the child's own needs or another's basic needs or is unable to exercise good judgment in responding to any kind of physical or emotional crisis,"" according to the statement. But the resource is little help to parents who are trying to figure out at what age they can legally allow their children to go out into the world alone. ""Parents I talk to are nervous about doing anything, thinking they could get charged for something without knowing what they're doing wrong,"" Whitehead said.Do you think authorities are simply doing their job by arresting parents who let young children go places alone, or are they overreacting?

"The rare moments Christos Sourovelis can take a break from running his own painting business, he can be found toiling away on his family's dream house in the suburbs of Philadelphia. ""I'm a working guy. I work every day, six days a week, even seven if I have to,"" Sourovelis says. One day this past March, without warning, the government took his house away, even though he and his wife, Markella, have never been charged with a crime or accused of any wrongdoing. ""I was so upset thinking somebody's going to take my house for nothing. That makes me crazy,"" Sourovelis says, shaking his head. The nightmare began when police showed up at the house and arrested their 22-year-old son, Yianni, on drug charges -- $40 worth of heroin. Authorities say he was selling drugs out of the home. The Sourvelises say they had no knowledge of any involvement their son might have had with drugs. A month-and-a-half later police came back -- this time to seize their house, forcing the Sourvelises and their children out on the street that day. Authorities came with the electric company in tow to turn off the power and even began locking the doors with screws, the Sourvelises say. Authorities won't comment on the exact circumstances because of pending litigation regarding the case. Police and prosecutors came armed with a lawsuit against the house itself. It was being forfeited and transferred to the custody of the Philadelphia District Attorney. Authorities said the house was tied to illegal drugs and therefore subject to civil forfeiture. In two years, nearly 500 families in Philadelphia had their homes or cars taken away by city officials, according to records from Pennsylvania's attorney general. Authorities use a civil forfeiture law that allows them to seize people's property when that property is connected to the sale of illegal drugs. CNN legal analyst and consumer attorney, Brian Kabateck, says the law is intended to protect the public. ""It discourages crime and it takes the ill-gotten gains away from the bad people."" But not all people who have their property taken away are charged with a crime. Unlike criminal forfeiture, the civil law allows authorities to seize property without the owner ever being convicted or even charged. In North Carolina property can be forfeited only if the property owner is actually convicted of a crime. This is not so in other states. Civil liberties attorneys with the Institute for Justice, who recently filed a class action lawsuit against Philadelphia authorities for abusing the law, say, ""Civil forfeiture is something that is an assault upon fundamental notions of private property ownership and due process."" But Kabateck disagrees, ""It's a good law. It works. That doesn't mean that it doesn't sometimes have issues that need to be corrected. The system constantly has to change."" In Pennsylvania, the City of Brotherly Love is far and away the most aggressive in the state when it comes to people's property. Over a four-year period, Allegheny County, the second largest county in Pennsylvania, filed about 200 petitions for civil forfeiture. Philadelphia filed nearly 7,000 petitions in one year alone, according to the class action lawsuit, in which the Sourvelises are plaintiffs, along with other Philadelphia citizens. Philadelphia officials seized more than 1,000 houses, about 3,300 vehicles and $44 million in cash, totaling $64 million in civil forfeitures over a 10-year period, according to the lawsuit. The very authorities taking the property appear to be profiting from it, according to Pennsylvania state records. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's office says about $7 million went straight to the salaries for the Philadelphia District Attorney's office and the police department in just three years. In that same time period, records show the D.A.'s office spent no money on community-based drug and crime-fighting programs, according to the Philadelphia AG's office. The Philadelphia District Attorney's office told CNN it seizes property only as a last resort, and added that it is limited in what it can currently say because of the pending litigation. ""In most cases the Public Nuisance Task Force doesn't pursue forfeiture because the underlying issue with the real estate is resolved when a settlement agreement is reached with the property owner in which he or she agrees to take reasonable efforts to prevent future narcotics dealing from the property."" The DA's office also says it works directly with citizens, the police, government agencies, and community groups in an effort to abate or close drug properties. Civil forfeiture can be used on the federal or state level. Only eight states -- Maine, Maryland, Missouri, Indiana, Vermont, North Carolina, Ohio and North Dakota -- require seized funds be placed in a neutral account. Other states allow law enforcement to directly profit from the civil forfeitures or put proceeds into a special crime fighting fund. In some states, like Pennsylvania, the burden is on the property owner to prove their innocence. The Sourvelises say they had to go to a courtroom and fight to get their home back where, instead of facing a judge, they faced a prosecutor from the DA's office. There was no courtroom or judge, Christos Sourvelis says. ""There's just one guy telling us to sign these papers. That's it."" After eight days of sleeping on a family member's couch, the Sourvelises were let back into their house, but only on the guarantee they would ban their son from the house -- a heartbreaking decision, they say. (Their son pleaded no contest to the drug charges.) Still fighting the city to resolve their case and stay in their home permanently, Markella Sourovelis says: ""To me I'm home, but I feel violated at this point. I'm doing things in my house, but I worry is it always going to be my house? Are they going to take it one day like that?"" The Philadelphia District Attorney's office told CNN it strictly follows the state law in an effort to crack down on drug abuse. ""In these efforts we will follow applicable law to protect the rights of those involved -- not only drug dealers and those associated with them -- but the law-abiding citizens who are negatively affected by them.""

"(CNN)You can dramatically reduce your chances of having heart disease or dying from heart disease if you do six simple things. That's what a new study in the recent edition of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found. And it's good news since studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that heart disease is the leading cause of death for American women and men. February is American Heart Month. This latest study used data came from 88,940 women between age 27 and 44 enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study II  from 1991 to 2011. The study looked at how many women smoked (or quit), what their body mass index was, what their physical activity level was, how much they watched TV and what their diet was like. In 20 years of follow-up, there were 456 cases of coronary heart disease. Researchers noticed that of the women who didn't have coronary heart disease and stayed healthy, the greater majority had six lifestyle habits in common. So, here is what you need to do. And while women were studied in this case, these habits would be good for men's hearts, too. Smoking doesn't hurt just your lungs and age your skin prematurely, it also hurts your heart. In fact, nearly as many smokers die of heart disease as they do from lung cancer. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The chemicals in cigarettes cause physical damage to your heart, and they mess with your blood cells. There's a reason the World Health Organization calls smoking the ""gradual killer."" Smoking can cause plaque to build up in your heart. That plaque narrows your arteries, making it hard for the blood to circulate. Have too much plaque, and you've got coronary heart disease. If you don't smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, ask for help. Only about 4% of people are able to quit without counseling or medicine, according to the American Cancer Society. Body mass index looks at your height and weight to measure how much body fat you have. Researchers determined that optimal BMI was 18.5 to 24.9, which scientists typically characterize as ""normal weight."" A ""normal weight"" is probably a stretch for most Americans. The average BMI is 26.5 for women, according to the CDC. The next category could help. These women weren't at an hourlong exercise class class every day. They exercised at least 2.5 hours a week. That's less time than most people spend in the shower each week. It's not a high bar, but the study found even a small amount of physical activity made a real difference. What counts as moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise? It means walking at a moderate or brisk pace, backpacking, hiking, bicycling, doing yoga, boxing, tennis or most any team sport. So get out there and get physical. A ""healthy"" diet was based on the Alternative Healthy Eating Index. That's a fancy term the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion came up with to determine how well American diets ""conform to recommended healthy eating patterns."" What does that mean for you? If you are active, you can eat about 2,200 calories a day and maintain your weight and still be considered healthy.  If you exercise sometimes, try 2,000. If you have chosen to sit in front of the TV most nights, keep your diet to 1,800 calories. It's not just about counting calories, though. You should be eating a balance of food from all the major food groups. If it's been a while since you stared at one of those food posters in health class, that means: . • Eat 2½ cups a day of vegetables, cooked or raw, or salads. • Eat two cups of fruit, raw or cooked. Or it can come in the form of a cup of juice if it is 100% fruit juice, rather than some sugary substitute your kids love. • Eat 6 ounces of grains. That could mean half a cup of rice or pasta or a slice of bread. • Eat three cups of dairy. It could be yogurt, 2 ounces of cheese, or drink a cup of milk or soy milk. • Eat 5½ ounces of protein. That means seafood or nuts or beans or peas. Lean meat or eggs or poultry work, too. Repeat all that daily. It may sound like a lot, but the good news is that your menu would have variety and give you a lot of options for meals. You're not stuck eating only grapefruit or doing some crazy diet. That guideline is painful for someone who works for a TV company, but the good news is you don't have to give up ""Scandal"" and ""Downton Abbey"" completely. ""Limited"" television is estimated at about seven hours a week or less. That means there's room for ""Anderson Cooper 360°,"" too. Earlier studies have found people who watch more than seven hours of TV tend to sleep less and weigh more. Sitting for long periods disrupts your metabolism. Too much sitting may kill you, new studies show. So, if you are going to watch television, at least do it standing or exercise a bit while watching. Yes, you read that correctly. The women who avoided heart disease drank alcohol. The key, of course, is to be moderate about it.  That was defined as about one drink a day for nonpregnant women. Earlier studies have shown that women who do drink in moderation have a better chance than nondrinkers of staying healthy as they age. Moderate drinking can reduce inflammation, promote healthy cholesterol levels, improve insulin resistance and help blood vessels function properly. The CDC suggests that you shouldn't start drinking for the health impact if you don't drink already. There are a lot of extra calories in alcohol. Andrea Kaye Chomistek, the study's lead author, said an important takeaway from the report is that women who followed just one of these six habits improved their chances of avoiding heart disease. ""It is not do all or nothing to succeed,"" said Chomistek, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Indiana University, Bloomington. ""Even if you targeted one, two of these behaviors, your chances improve significantly."" The other takeaway, she said, is that you should start doing one (or all) these things while you are still young, long before you may show any signs that you could be heart sick. ""People in their 30s and 40s often feel invincible and don't feel they need to worry about heart disease, but that's not the case,"" she said. ""We saw plenty of cases of heart disease in that category, not a huge number, but women did develop risks. ""These are simple things women can do to avoid going in that direction.""","Heart disease is the leading cause of death for American women and men, CDC says .

"(CNN)He calls measles 'benign.' If you vaccinate your child, he calls you a bad mother. And he says our children ""have the right"" to get infections. When Dr. Jack Wolfson speaks, jaws drop. But his fans applaud. He has given a medical face to the anti-vaccine movement -- eagerly stepping in front of TV cameras to beat up on vaccines and make light of the dangerous diseases they help prevent. During the recent upsurge of measles cases, he's been a frequent presence. But this week, he's suddenly gone silent. E-mails and phone calls went unanswered. And  Wednesday, when a CNN news team showed up at his practice, someone called the police. Confronted in the parking lot, Wolfson turned his back to the camera. Why the about-face? It may have something to do with the investigation that the Arizona Medical Board has opened against him. Parents following advice like those Wolfson gives are at the core of the U.S. outbreak, which is infecting mostly unvaccinated children. And some doctors have advocated that medical licenses be revoked for recommendations like his. The board says it's received two complaints and is investigating. But it wouldn't disclose the nature of the complaints. ""Can we talk about the investigation?"" CNN's Kyung Lah asked Wolfson Wednesday. ""I have no comment,"" he responded. ""Are you changing your opinion about vaccinations?"" she asked. He was silent. Wolfson trained at Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine, then did residencies in internal medicine and cardiology. He sells himself as a traditional cardiologist who turned away from his practice in disappointment. ""For years I practiced like any other cardiologist using pharmaceuticals and dangerous procedures. I became disenchanted with conventional medicine,"" he said in a promotional video. Instead of antibiotics, he's likely to prescribe sleep, good family relationships and an organic diet. His anti-vaccine stance stems from his views on putting chemicals in our bodies. ""What I am opposed to is that we are injecting chemicals into our children,"" Wolfson said, when he recently appeared on CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront. ""This is aluminum, mercury, sometimes aborted fetal proteins. There's antibiotics in there."" Some of that's correct, the CDC has said in its list of vaccine ingredients. But it's not worth worrying about. For example: A common aluminum compound found in many vaccines -- aluminum hydroxide -- is also the active ingredient in antacid tablets. And some of it's wrong: Trace amounts of a mercury compound used in adult vaccines, is now absent from almost all pediatric formulas, the CDC has said. And vaccines have proven very safe for decades. They save lives and preserve health, the CDC said. Before a vaccine was introduced to prevent measles, the United States had up to four million cased per year, the CDC says. Thousands were left with serious impairment like deafness or permanent brain damage. Up to 500 people died back then each year. Wolfson has delivered some shocking statements during the current measles outbreak, which he approves of. Better to get the disease than the vaccine, he's said. He called measles ""benign."" The fact that some people die is unfortunate but par for the course. ""Bad things can happen to anybody. We can be in a car accident; we can be in a toaster fire,"" he said. ""We should be getting measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, these are the rights of our children to get it,"" he told the Arizona Republic. It's nature's way of building resistance; vaccines are unnatural, he has said. Wolfson would be willing to take the death of another parent's child into account to uphold the right not to vaccinate his own. ""I'm not going to sacrifice the wellbeing of my child. My child is pure,"" he said. ""And I'm not going to put my child at risk to save another child."" On his YouTube channel, Wolfson makes light of measles with a video from a black-and-white TV show that apparently aired in 1959 before a vaccine was available. Its message, delivered as quotes from the characters: ""It's not serious."" ""It's kid's stuff."" ""They are doing active harm,"" said Dr. Peter Lipson, a practicing internist, who has urged  state medical boards to investigate and pull the licenses of physicians like Wolfson. ""As physicians we are supposed to do no harm. These doctors are creating harm. They are promoting the spread of infectious diseases, which we should have wiped out by now."" Tell that to Wolfson's patients. Outside his office, the parking lot was full Wednesday. His office told CNN his schedule is packed with patients -- seeking the doctor's medical advice.","Dr. Jack Wolfson preached against vaccines in the media .

"Billions of locusts -- everywhere the eye can see, eating most everything in sight. That's the harsh reality affecting roughly half the island nation of Madagascar, infested by swarms of the bugs flying in sometimes mile-long packs. Run for 30 to 45 minutes, and you still might not be able to shake them. ""It's like you are in a movie, it's incredible,"" said Alexandre Huynh of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, or FAO, from the country's capital of Antananarivo. ""You don't see anything except locusts. You turn around, there are locusts everywhere."" Locusts' targets aren't people, but they do ravenously devour what people eat -- directly in the form of crops, and indirectly in the form of pastureland that livestock and other animals graze on. Without concerted and effective action, experts say the crisis could very easily prove deadly in a nation such as Madagascar, where the U.N. estimates more than two-thirds of residents lived in poverty before this crisis. Doing nothing would mean the locust plague could spread across two-thirds of the island, which sits in the Indian Ocean off Africa's southeastern coast. Even after a lull in winter, they'd wake up in the spring in greater numbers and, without action, remain a devastating presence for a full decade, Huynh said. This year's infestation is the worst since the 1950s. Older farmers who remember that crisis and see the big swarms nowadays ""stop farming, because they know that it's useless,"" said Huynh, the FAO's emergency and rehabilitation coordinator in Madagascar. ""They know there's hunger coming on."" Photos: Locusts plague the Holy Land . By virtue of its distinct location, Madagascar is one of the world's most ecologically diverse areas. About 90% of its plant species exist nowhere else on the planet, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society, and many of its bird, reptile and animal species -- including all the world's lemurs in the wild -- are endemic. The quality of life, however, for Madagascar's more than 22 million people is low compared to many other countries. Some 77% of its residents live on less than $1.25 per day, according to UNICEF official Natascha Paddison. It's infant mortality rate of 47.40 deaths per 1,000 live births ranks 47th highest out of 223 ranked by the CIA World Factbook. The situation has been compounded by natural disasters like Tropical Cyclone Haruna that killed at least 23 people and adversely affected some 22,000 others, as well as a prolonged political crisis after an effective military coup in 2009. That was followed by criticism of Madagascar's new leaders -- such as from U.S. Embassy Charge d'Affaires Eric Wong, who noted reports that press freedoms had been restricted, political enemies were being held for years without trial, and civilians were raped or executed while their villages burned. The criticism contributed to a sharp drop in foreign aid, which accounted for 70% of the government budget. Using the Xbox to study locust swarms . But the international community remains involved in Madagascar -- including the United States, which donates $70 million annually. Even more help is urgently needed, FAO officials said, in order to prevent an even worse humanitarian crisis tied to the locust plague. Long-term, the U.N. organization is seeking $19 million for an early warning system -- so the next time locusts appear, authorities can act quickly and decisively to prevent their spread. But it's too late for that this time, Huynh said. That's why the agency is seeking $22 million through June to carry out a large-scale spraying operation. These figures do not include whatever food and humanitarian assistance Madagascar could need. ""There is no more use in preventing anything,"" said Huynh, stressing the pressing need to fight the infestation. ""It is really an emergency situation.""","Billions of locusts infest half of Madagascar and could cover 2/3 of the island nation .

"(CNN)As Bobbi Kristina Brown remains in a medically induced coma fighting for her life, little information about the incident at her Atlanta-area home or her condition has slipped from police or family. If the investigation into what happened to the 21-year-old only child of Whitney Houston has revealed much, no one is talking publicly about it. We do know this: Brown was discovered facedown in a bathtub at her Roswell, Georgia, home over the weekend, and she was reportedly found by the man she has called her husband, and a friend. Here's what we know about the players involved in the story. Bobbi Kristina Brown . She is the daughter of two singers who were pop music icons of 1980s and 1990s. She was born on March 4, 1993, less than a year after parents, Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, wed. At the time, her mother was enjoying critical acclaim for her first acting role in ""The Bodyguard"" and for the accompanying soundtrack, which featured Houston belting out a rendition of Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You."" It appears Bobbi Kristina wanted to follow in her parents' footsteps. As a youngster, she appeared on stage with her mother on numerous occasions. She told Oprah Winfrey during a 2012 interview that her plan for life included the ""singing thing ... some acting, some dancing."" She also spoke to Winfrey about how much she missed her mother, who died February 11, 2012. Days before Bobbi Kristina Brown's hospitalization, her Twitter timeline seemed to indicate her mother and her own singing career were quite on her mind. On January 26 at 4:14 a.m., about two weeks before the anniversary of her mother's death, Bobbi Kristina Brown tweeted, ""Littlelady&yourgrowing young man @nickdgordon miss you mommy ..:') SOmuch.. loving you more every sec. #Anniversary!"" About an hour earlier, she tweeted, ""Hiworld :)(: yes I am a night owl, this is when my creative side come's out. ALLTHETIME! I need2be in the studio RITENOW! #SOONverySOON!"" She was found Saturday unresponsive in her Roswell townhome. Nobody knows what caused Brown's unresponsiveness, Roswell police spokeswoman Lisa Holland said, but police have said they consider it a medical incident. Investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. The incident report referenced a drowning. Police had been to Brown's residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there on January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, Holland said. Nick Gordon . Bobbi Kristina Brown called him her husband, but her father's attorney released a statement saying the two were never married. Bobbi Kristina Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon, and in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, along with the words, ""#HappilyMarried• SO#Inlove."" Gordon, 25, faced criticism following the tweet from those who questioned how he could marry a woman he considered his sister. Gordon had lived with Houston and her daughter since he was 12 years old. He once told the show ""Extra"" that Houston treated him like a son and ""made me promise several times to look after Krissy ... and, Mom, I will never, ever, ever break that promise."" Gordon was one of the two people who reportedly found Bobbi Kristina Brown unresponsive in the tub. Max Lomas . Lomas, 24, was the other. In response to several media outlets reporting Lomas' lengthy rap sheet, attorney Philip Holloway issued a statement Tuesday saying his client is a cooperative witness and Lomas' most recent arrest in January has nothing to do with Brown's hospitalization. Holloway told CNN on Wednesday that his client was the one who actually found Brown and called 911. Holloway's comments came after he met with Roswell police for two hours; his client was not at the meeting, he said. On January 15, Lomas was booked on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of alprazolam (aka Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug), and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or the attempt to commit a felony, according to Fulton County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan. CNN has learned from Fulton and Dawson County authorities that Lomas was arrested at least three times in 2011 and 2012 and charged with a host of crimes, including battery and alcohol, weapons, drug and probation violations. Holloway did not mention the previous arrests in his statement. ""Mr. Lomas' widely reported recent arrest is completely unrelated to the incidents that occurred at Ms. Brown's residence and there is absolutely no relationship between the events. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges,"" Holloway said. ""Mr. Lomas has not been accused of anything in connection with Bobbi Kristina Brown's injuries."" Bobby Brown . Bobbi Kristina Brown's father is as much known for his shenanigans as he is for his music, if not more. He shot to fame in 1984 on the back of the hits, ""Mr. Telephone Man"" and ""Cool it Now,"" by his band, New Edition. The band would eventually splinter into three relatively successful solo acts and the R&B trio, Bell Biv Devoe. Upon leaving New Edition (it's debatable what precipitated his departure as competing narratives suggest he either left voluntarily or was voted out by fellow band members), he embarked on a solo career that stuttered at first but eventually spawned numerous hits, including ""Don't Be Cruel,"" ""Every Little Step"" and ""My Prerogative,"" before fizzling in the 1990s. He married Houston in 1992, and the story line surrounding Brown would quickly become one of cocaine, booze, rehab, arrests and alleged violence against Houston, who filed for divorce in 2006. The marriage ended in 2007. Brown, who turned 46 on Thursday, reportedly got sober after splitting from Houston, but he has been arrested for DUI, entered rehab and has been jailed since their split. Whitney Houston . A songstress with a golden voice and the cousin of Dionne Warwick, Houston's albums have sold tens of millions of copies worldwide. The soundtrack to ""The Bodyguard"" went platinum 17 times in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and reportedly sold 45 million copies worldwide. Her first No. 1 hit would come in 1985 with ""Saving All My Love For You,"" and a string of No. 1 hits followed, as did a marginally successful acting career. However, she would not enjoy the spoils of, say, a Michael Jackson because she didn't write and produce her own songs. In an interview in 2002 with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Houston admitted to using drugs but denied the use of crack. She told Sawyer: ""The biggest devil is me. I'm either my best friend or my worst enemy."" Houston bounced in and out of drug rehab twice, declaring herself drug-free during a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey. When she drowned in a hotel bathtub almost three years before Bobbi Kristina Brown was found in a similar state (cocaine and heart disease were cited as factors in her death), Houston, 48, had an estate worth an estimated $12 million to $20 million. According to her will, which she signed about a month before Bobbi Kristina Brown's 1993 birth, her daughter was the sole heir to her estate. If she had no children, the will said, the money was to be split among her mother, father (now deceased), two brothers and Bobby Brown.  She filed an amendment to the will in 2000 but only changed the executor and one of the trustees. The heirs remained the same. It was widely reported that when Bobbi Kristina Brown turned 21 in March 2014, she received the first installment from her trust, one-tenth of her mother's estate. Bobbi Kristina Brown is scheduled to receive one-sixth of the estate in 2018 and the remaining balance in 2023. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Greg Botelho, John Newsome, Carolyn Sung, Lisa Respers France and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Bobbi Kristina Brown has said she wanted to be singer like her mother .

"It is an age-old question: will humankind ever defeat old age? Plenty of skin care companies would like us to believe so. And now, the multinational tech giant Google would like us to think it might be possible too. Last month Google announced a new medical company called Calico, whose explicit aim is to take on aging itself. But what will Google's approach be? And what other research into prolonging life already exists? With its proliferation of businesses, products and services, it would be easy to forget that not so very long ago Google was just a search engine. Today, offshoots of the sprawling global corporation can be found researching self-driving cars, developing their own smart phones and tablets and even launching giant balloons into near space. Read more: 'Afterlife' feels 'even more real than real' Amid this growing portfolio of diffuse interests and initiatives has been added their latest company: Calico. Calico -- or the California Life Company -- has been set up to research subjects related to aging and its associated diseases. Announcing Calico at a media briefing, Google said that the new and independent company will largely focus on age-attendant conditions such as Alzheimer's, cancer and heart disease. Larry Page, Google's ever youthful CEO said: ""Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, I believe we can improve millions of lives."" But the question is, what will Calico actually do? At the moment the company isn't giving much detail away: ""(Incoming CEO Arthur Levinson) and I are excited about tackling aging and illness,"" Page wrote in his Google+ blog post. But repeated requests from CNN to interview either Page or Levinson were politely declined. Read more: Scientists build human brain inside a computer . In the absence of any real information, many commentators have speculated that Calico will pursue a 'big-data' approach to health: gathering massive amounts of information from patients and 'crunching it' to help speed the way to health care discoveries. Some have suggested that Calico's new CEO will take the view that the best way to tackle aging is to focus on preventing diseases. Aubrey de Grey, an expert in the field of regenerative medicine, told CNN that it is too soon to speculate on what Google's approach will be: ""in relation to Calico, I think it's vital to keep in mind that there is essentially no concrete information about their planned direction and emphasis, and any guess that they will take a heavily data-driven approach is no more than a guess."" However, he does think that Calico will not limit its focus to a single disease: ""The statements from Page and Levinson thus far indicate quite strongly that the emphasis will not be just cancer, or even just a range of specific diseases, but will be 'aging itself': Page in particular has highlighted the paltry longevity gains that would arise even from totally eliminating cancer."" João Pedro de Magalhães, a Portuguese biologist who leads the Integrative Genomics of Aging group at the University of Liverpool, agrees: ""From what I've read, I don't think the company will mostly focus on cancer. In the Time interview Larry Page clearly states that solving cancer is 'not as big an advance as you might think'. This is reminiscent of what experts studying aging have been saying for a while, which is that to really make a difference in human health and longevity you need to tackle the aging process rather than individual age-related diseases."" Read more: Secrets spilled in life's final minutes . So where might Calico's focus lie? A broad range of technologies and therapies that promise life extension through different means are currently being researched and tested. CNN Labs takes a look across the scientific landscape to bring you the view from the front line of the war against aging. Cryonics . Cryonics is a process where the body -- or occasionally just the head -- is suspended in liquid nitrogen to 'preserve' it indefinitely. The idea is that in the future the body will be able to be resuscitated and brought back to life. Once the preserve of celebrities and multimillionaires, cryonics is now gaining traction among the broader public. Several months ago, The Sunday Times reported that three senior staff at Oxford University have signed up to have their bodies frozen with two U.S.-based cyonics organizations: the Cryonics Institute and the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. The cost of cryonics can vary wildly. The lowest price at the Cryonics Institute is reportedly $28,000 for 'cryopreservation'; Alcor Life charges customers up to $200,000 for similar services. But does it work? The Cryonics Institute underline on their website that, as yet, their treatments are based on projections of technology to come rather than present day science: ""We firmly believe that with the incredible advances being made in nanotechnology, medicine and science today, cryonics has the same potential to become an everyday reality in the not-so-distant future ... The goal of cryonics is to halt (the 'dying')  process as quickly as possible after legal death, giving future doctors the best possible chance of reviving the patient by repairing or replacing damaged tissues, or even entire organs using advanced computer, nanotech and medical equipment and procedures"". Cryotherapy . The related field of cryotherapy has gained currency in some quarters of athletics, with coaches immersing their athletes in cryotherapy chambers during or after exercise in a bid to aid training and heal injuries. The French soccer team used cryotherapy during the European Cup in 2012, and the Wales rugby union squad use it as well. Cryotherapeutic chambers expose players to very low temperatures -- around minus 256 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 Celsius) -- for short periods. Some theorists believe that doing so can help speed the body's recovery, but others say that the evidence is incomplete. Self-healing worms and telomeres . In 2012 a group of scientists at Nottingham University discovered that a species of flatworm -- the Planarian worm --can divide 'potentially forever' and thus heal itself. Some researchers hope that the discovery will provide fresh insight into how it may be possible to alleviate aging in human cells. Dr Aziz Aboobaker from Nottingham University's School of Biology, said: ""Usually when stem cells divide -- to heal wounds, or during reproduction or for growth -- they start to show signs of aging. This means that the stem cells are no longer able to divide and so become less able to replace exhausted specialized cells in the tissues of our bodies. Our aging skin is perhaps the most visible example of this effect. Planarian worms and their stem cells are somehow able to avoid the aging process and to keep their cells dividing."" According to researchers looking at the worm, the key may be in understanding the function of telomeres -- the ends of a chromosome that protect cells against degradation. In 2009 three scientists won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on how telomeres protect chromosomes from degradation. One theory suggests that if we can work out a way to preserve telomeres, then we would be another step closer to defeating aging. Cloning and body part replacement . Another major area of investigation is looking into organ creation and replacement. Many people die due to organ failure, but imagine if you could just create your own new liver and replace a faulty one? Scientists have already successfully implanted functioning lab-grown kidneys into rats. If the therapy could be successfully (and affordably) replicated for humans, it could help overcome the significant organ donor shortages that persist in many countries. Early work into creating organs using 3D printers has also yielded promising results. Nanotechnology . Organ replacement will probably only ever be part of the solution however. Many scientists believe that longevity through repairing the human body requires a broader focus than just replacing individual parts. Ray Kurzweil, an American author, inventor and futurist argues in his book The Singularity is Near that by the 2020s, nanotechnology may be able to help cure disease. Kurzweil says that deploying tiny robots (or 'nanobots') in the body could help overcome the problems of incorrect DNA replication --  one of the central causes of aging. de Grey says that nanotechnological research is interesting, but that he believes it is further away from finding a solution to aging than some other treatments: ""I pay attention to molecular manufacturing (the discipline that coined the term ""nanotechnology"" but then effectively had it stolen by the field of nanomaterials), but I think its relevance to medical interventions, whether in aging or otherwise, still seems likely to be further off than the more traditionally biomedical work"". So will Google's new company discover a workable solution to aging and death? Only time will tell.","Google's new company Calico will 'tackle aging and illness'

"North and South Korea exchanged fire Friday after gunners in the North targeted balloons carrying leaflets critical of the country's reclusive regime, the South Korean Defense Ministry said. North Korean gunners fired anti-aircraft rounds at the balloons for 20 minutes, and some of the shots landed on South Korean soil, the ministry said. After a warning, South Korea responded with a 40 rounds from a heavy machine gun, the ministry said. South Korean activists released the balloons filled with fliers critical of the North on Monday, the Defense Ministry said. The exchange is the latest in a series of similar incidents between the two countries, the most recent of which came Tuesday, when patrol boats from North Korea and South Korea exchanged fire in the Yellow Sea, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. It also comes amid tentative diplomatic overtures by North Korea and continuing intrigue over the status of the country's leader, Kim Jung Un, who has not been seen publicly for more than a month. Kim Jong Un misses shrine visit . A North Korean official said last week that the country was ready to resume negotiations over the country's nuclear efforts with Russia, the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. High-ranking Pyongyang officials also visited South Korea on Saturday, saying the North was willing to hold a new round of diplomatic talks between the two countries. North Korea has also reached out to the European Union. Ri Tong Il, the North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said Tuesday that North Korea and the European Union would hold human rights talks at the end of the year. Why has North Korea decided to talk now? Kim's disappearance from public view has also stoked discussion about who is leading the country and what's next. He missed a ceremony Friday in honor of his late father and grandfather on the 69th anniversary of one of the most powerful institutions in North Korean life, the Workers' Party of North Korea. Kim, 31, who first appeared as the North's top leader in 2010, has not been seen publicly since September 3, according to NK News.

Yep, for those keen to have their very own Boeing 747 seat or are looking for the perfect gift idea for a beloved aviation fan, Japan's All Nippon Airways (ANA) is selling seats from a decommissioned 747-400D. The plane, used on domestic routes, was retired in March and the seats go on sale from December 25 to February 28, 2015. Sadly, the electronics will be dismantled, which means no service button to get another glass of champagne or complain that the entertainment system has malfunctioned again. Bonus though -- little to no chance of some annoying passenger kicking the back of your seat. The other catch is that the seats are limited to domestic Japanese sales. They will be sold via this ANA online shopping site run by ANA Trading company (a division of the ANA group). ANA is expecting high demand -- lucky purchasers will be selected by lottery. There will only be a total of seven premium class seat sets available -- three single seats and four double seats. The single seat is listed at 647,000 yen ($5,420) and 747,000 yen ($6,260) for the double. This includes tax and shipping with deliveries due in March. ANA Trading Company's Ryota Isomura says his company wanted to make sure aviation fans could own their own part of such an iconic airplane. Boeing's 747 debuted at the Paris Air Show in 1969 and quickly revolutionized air travel. More than 1,400 747 variants have been delivered by Boeing. The 747-400 ended production in 2009. Its successor, the 747-8 Intercontinental rolled out in 2012.","Seven 'premium' sets of 747 seats are for sale .

"(CNN)Think you need a passport to explore high art, exotic beaches and incredible natural wonders? Not so. In a country of nearly 4 million square miles, there are plenty of new adventures for travelers right here in the United States. Lonely Planet's top 10 U.S. destinations for 2015 list includes cities marking important anniversaries, wide open natural spaces and hidden city gems that will soon be popular. ""I hope this list will excite travelers to explore places they hadn't thought about going, "" said Regis St. Louis, author of Lonely Planet's USA guide and contributor to the ""Best in the U.S."" list. ""We have both surprising places on the list and places people have heard buzz about."" Lonely Planet editors hope the list will encourage people to explore. ""There are lots of great things happening all over the country, and you should really come out and see it for yourself,"" St. Louis said. To compile the annual list, Lonely Planet asks its U.S. staff, authors and contributors to nominate urban and natural spots, popular and lesser known sites, and locations that have something significant happening in 2015. The staff whittles the list down to the final 10, and a natural order often emerges, editors say. Americans don't get as much vacation as Europeans, and we also don't use all of our vacation. So why not put those days to good use and visit some of Lonely Planet's top destinations in the U.S.? Here are the 10 spots that came out on top for 2015: . 1.Queens, New York . 2.Western South Dakota . 3.New Orleans . 4.Colorado River region . 5.North Conway, New Hampshire . 6.Indianapolis . 7.Greenville, South Carolina . 8.Oakland, California . 9.Duluth, Minnesota . 10.Mount Shasta region, California .","More than 100 languages are spoken in Lonely Planet's top U.S. spot for 2015 .

"I'm knee deep in the icy Atnarko River in central British Columbia. A belt is cinched across my chest waders to prevent water from dragging me under if I slip in. Cougar tracks are pressed into the snow on the bank. At least the grizzlies, which feast on spawning salmon here each fall, are napping this time of year. On this morning, my guide Jai Condon demonstrates the art of fly-fishing. He flicks the rod. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. And, releases. ""How do you lay the line down so nicely?"" someone asks. ""Practice,"" he says, laughing. I'm terrible. I don't get a nibble even though trout can be caught year round in the Bella Coola Valley, about 1,000 kilometers north of Vancouver. I didn't come here to fish, but I'm hooked. Magical geography . Heavy fog scuttles my first full day of heli-snowboarding. But Bella Coola Heli Sports has a genius Plan B, C, D, and so on, for the inevitable down days. Conceived as an exclusive year-round resort appealing to the hard-core athlete looking for the kind of snow porn experience they've seen in ski movies, Bella Coola also keeps the grumpy, grounded adventurer content. Depending on the season, there's cross-country skiing, hiking, biking, rafting, horseback riding, grizzly bear watching, and even, cattle ranching. (Help during calving and ski in the afternoon. Yes, really.) A helicopter or boat (based on your level of indulgence) will also ferry guests to the fjords to soak in natural hot springs followed by a polar plunge in the Pacific Ocean. ""We didn't come here for the vertical,"" says Kristina Enquist, visiting from Finland with her husband, Eric. ""We came here for the whole experience."" The region's magical geography is what attracted a trio of filmmakers -- Christian Begin, Peter ""Swede"" Mattsson and Beat Steiner -- here 14 years ago. Glaciers that date back to the last ice age blanket the Coast Mountains, which erupt from sea level to its highest peak, Mt. Waddington, at 4,019 meters. This landscape doubled for the Himalayas in feature films ""Seven Years in Tibet"" and ""Kundun."" Sir Edmund Hillary even trained here. And, 30 meters of snow piles up annually. ""Wow, this place is on steroids,"" Steiner recalls of his first visit. ""Everything about it is big. The trees are big. The mountains are big. The glaciers are big. The biggest fjords in the Americas. It's all big."" While the heli-ski industry was booming along the spine of the continent, nobody was operating here. The three mountain men applied for, and to their surprise, secured 10,700 square kilometers of terrain. ""Everybody was busy fighting in the interior,"" says Begin. ""We grabbed the jewel. We grabbed the coast."" 'Rock star treatment' Since 2003, Bella Coola has whisked guests from Vancouver to this remote paradise. The one-hour flight in a Beechcraft 1900C is as spectacular as Steiner describes, if not stomach churning. Jet-lagged tourists from the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, Slovakia and Thailand are also aboard and head to lessons in helicopter and avalanche safety. Skiing upon arrival is part of the outfitter's ""rock star"" treatment. But the conditions are awful. Heavy snowfall, followed by a warm spell and a freeze means there's an extreme avalanche risk. I cut my edges into a layer of crust harder than week-old pizza. After a few teeth-chattering runs, we land at Tweedsmuir Park Lodge where guests acquaint themselves with the outdoor hot tub and teepee sweat lodge or gorge on salmon. Bella Coola operates three lodges where a maximum of 34 guests a week never have to fight for fresh turns. Meanwhile, other heli-ski operators run dozens of people per day over much smaller tenures, which, according to Mattsson, isn't private enough for his clientele. Those with especially deep pockets book the Pantheon Heli Ranch where up to eight guests have exclusive use of 4,450 square kilometers of terrain. They also get coveted first descents. Test a run that has never been skied and then name it. The cost: $105,260 ($114,800 Canadian) a week. Typical guests are executives, doctors, celebrities; those aged 45 to 55. Almost all are men. ""It's always been a kind of a boy's club,"" Mattsson says. ""I think heli-skiing is overall."" 'Secret weapon' Richard Lapointe is a former military pilot who has flown stunt jets, search and rescue missions and in conflict zones. He's at the stick of my ride, an AStar B2 helicopter that seats only four guests. He's also what my guide calls a ""secret weapon."" Lapointe sneaks between impossibly tight rock faces and lands on plateaus the size of picnic tables in search of powder. The snow gods have also delivered. A dump of weightless snow is up to my knees. I rack up 13,840 vertical meters of fresh lines in two days. I glide by vast blue glaciers in the alpine, the only color on an endless canvas of untracked white. Knobs and drifts in the forests send me airborne. My powder board leaves a deep channel -- and white smoke -- in my wake. ""You know junkies looking for their next fix? says Eric Enquist, the more daring half of the Finnish couple. ""Now, I know what they were talking about."" Nobody is oblivious to the danger as we pick through recent avalanche debris and watch an ice sheet give way from a mountainside. Condon, my fishing guide, later returns to the lodge cradling a block of that ancient ice. Chipped into glasses of scotch and other libations, I'm happy to have it dilute my spirits. On my last day -- another when the helicopter can't fly -- Begin takes a group to the town of Bella Coola, population 852, which the Nuxalk First Nation calls home. The influence of aboriginal peoples, who have been in the region for 10,000 years, is everywhere. Totem poles dot the streets. Along Big Cedars Trail, an old-growth forest with massive trees features one that has been hollowed out to smoke fish. It smells of meat. Not far away, but tough to find without a guide, are the Thorsen Creek petroglyphs, a collection of mysterious rock carvings. Brushing off a light dusting of snow, we find dozens of etchings of human faces, animals and geometric patterns. The origins are still debated, but it's little wonder First Nations peoples consider this place sacred. As I step back into the present, I learn all flights home are scrubbed due to strong winds and heavy snow. I'm told this is a once-a-year event, leaving me happily stranded in Shangri-La.

"Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962. Critics say the November 7 elections -- its first in two decades -- aim to create a facade of democracy. The constitution requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament, which critics say is aimed at tightening the regime's grip on the Southeast Asian nation. Democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi has said she will not vote in the elections. Her party won a landslide election victory in 1990, but the military junta rejected the results. The regime recently passed a law that made Suu Kyi ineligible to run because of a court conviction. The Nobel laureate has called the law unjust. Her supporters have said the conviction was a way to remove her from the election campaign. Suu Kyi has spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest. The new law forced her party, the National League for Democracy, to choose between honoring her as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal -- or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the election. It decided to skip the race. Read CNN reporter's firsthand account of Myanmar after Cyclone Nargis .","Myanmar has been under military rule since 1962 .

"Seventy years ago, thousands of Allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy to take on the might of the German army. The soldiers all carried guns and grenades, but Private Tony Vaccaro of the U.S. Army was armed with something else as well: a camera. In the days, weeks and months that followed the D-Day landings in northern France, Vaccaro, who was born in Pennsylvania, took more than 8,000 photographs with his trusty 35mm Argus C3. The pictures -- many of them raw, graphic, disturbing -- follow his advance, and that of his unit, the 83rd Infantry Division, from the beaches to Berlin. They represent one of the most complete collections of images of World War II, as seen through the eyes of someone who fought during the conflict. Now a spritely 92-year-old, the former G.I. is back in Normandy to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings with an exhibition. Vaccaro's show, ""Shots of War"" is on display at the Caen Memorial, a stone's throw from Omaha Beach where the infantryman came ashore 70 years ago. ""The first thing I see is this gun, looking at me,"" he told CNN on a tour of the exhibition, gesturing at a black-and-white photo of the intimidating weaponry that confronted him as he stepped onto French soil. Vaccaro's status as a regular soldier who happened to be carrying a camera -- rather than an official war photographer -- meant he had to make do with whatever equipment he could find. After begging and borrowing rolls of film, he would process his pictures by night, improvising by pouring chemicals into two army helmets to develop and fix the images. But it also meant he could get closer to the action, and to the people involved: the result is a series of photos which are often more candid than the official pictures of war. ""I was with the same unit, I knew everyone intimately,"" he says. ""The intimacy was at such a level that if I aimed a camera, they didn't react to it."" Vaccaro documented the devastation left in Normandy in the wake of D-Day and across Luxemburg, Belgium and Germany after years of warfare: villages and towns ravaged by the conflict, corpses lining the roads. He also captured some of the joys of liberation: a shot of a G.I. embracing a young French girl as others dance in the background is among his best-known images. In a short film made to accompany the exhibition, Vaccaro explains that his dual role as soldier and photographer meant he faced a constant choice between his gun and his camera. ""I considered the situation and I said 'first the rifle, then photographs' -- I was careful to make sure I would take photographs when I felt safe. If I didn't feel safe I didn't take the picture."" And he says that the speed at which he was forced to work also had an impact on the final images. ""Sometimes I was scared because I felt that while I was taking photographs perhaps the Nazis would kill me, would shoot me, so what I did was to work very quickly. Many times I didn't even look through the viewfinder, I just shot."" After the war, Vaccaro became a professional portrait and fashion photographer, working for magazines including ""Life"" and ""Look,"" taking pictures of stars including Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Pablo Picasso and Sophia Loren. Decades on, Vaccaro says he is disturbed at our failure to learn the lessons of the past and ensure that conflicts like the one he fought in -- and photographed -- are consigned to history. ""I think that the world, the way it's going, it hasn't changed at all. You'd think we would learn a lesson with World War II but we are arming like hell,"" he says. ""One of the greatest thing we should have, we don't have. A Department of Peace, we don't have it. You'd be surprised the need that we have to have that."" He has returned to Normandy many times in the decades since D-Day, and he's determined that this 70th anniversary visit won't be his last. ""I'm going to do this at 102,"" he insists, saying he'll be back in 2024. ""My doctor says: 'I don't know how you do it.'""

"News reports indicate that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear test, potentially scheduled to coincide with President Obama's visit to South Korea this week. The North Korean foreign minister warned Tuesday that Obama's trip could ""escalate confrontation and bring the dark clouds of a nuclear arms race,"" prompting speculation that the impulsive young leader of the North, Kim Jong Un, is again crying out for attention. Typically, experts and government officials refer to these outbursts and nuclear or missile tests as ""provocations,"" which are followed by sanctions, tensions and -- it is hoped -- a return to diplomacy.  But by now, it should be obvious that while North Korean behavior appears cyclical (""there they go again""), Pyongyang is on a clear, linear  path to developing nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them on target in Japan and eventually the United States. North Korea's third and most recent nuclear test, in February 2013, used a relatively small 6- to 9-kiloton plutonium-based nuclear warhead, according to the South Korea Ministry of Defense, roughly half the yield of the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If North Korea's new test is substantially larger, it will demonstrate that Pyongyang either has mastered the warhead design challenges of plutonium-based weapons or has covertly enriched uranium. If it is the former case, North Korea will more easily be able to miniaturize its nuclear warhead technology for mating with ballistic missiles. If the latter case, North Korea will probably demonstrate the ability to covertly stockpile large amounts of fissile material, since highly enriched uranium facilities can be more easily hidden underground and North Korea has plenty of uranium mines to obtain the necessary fuel. Either way, a ""new form"" of North Korean nuclear test would signal a substantial increase in the country's nuclear capabilities and not just another provocation requiring a short-term punishment from the international community. The United States and its allies and partners would no doubt seek to place additional sanctions on North Korea through the United Nations, if such a test were to occur. However, given current tensions with Russia, as well as Chinese concern about North Korean stability, it is unlikely that the U.N. Security Council would approve substantial new sanctions. Yet, deterring North Korea is critical. What more could be done? First, if the United States cannot win substantial new sanctions at the U.N., it should take additional steps in concert with South Korea, Japan and other allies and partners to squeeze the North's ability to import or export dangerous materials related to their missile and nuclear programs. Additional sanctions should target North Korean use of international banks to conduct illicit activities. Although some of these institutions have been targeted (most notably Banco Delta Asia in 2005), more can be done to cut North Korea off from its international financing. A coalition of like-minded states could also agree to inspect any and all ships or planes that have departed from North Korea in the previous six months.  This same coalition would work together to pressure Beijing to increase inspections and cut off illicit banking activities with North Korea. Moving China to action has usually been a challenge, but additional North Korean provocations and Kim Jong Un's execution of his uncle and China's contact in Pyongyang, Jang Song Thaek, could motivate China to take steps, particularly once it is clear that the U.S. is no longer willing to rely on the Security Council for another round of weak sanctions. Second, the U.S. should respond to any North Korean test by increasing cooperation trilaterally with Japan and South Korea. Although South Korea-Japan relations have been at a low point, the United States has spearheaded efforts to make progress in the bilateral relationship in recent months. Obama's visit to both countries will surely touch on this issue, but a North Korean provocation could help him drive Japan and South Korea toward closer cooperation, particularly on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; missile defense; and logistics. This would not only improve U.S.-Japan-South Korea cooperation but could also deter additional provocative actions and put pressure on Chinese leaders to restrain their North Korean ally.  In December 2010, the U.S., Japan and South Korea came very close to issuing a joint collective security statement, declaring that an attack by the North on any of us would be an attack on all of us, after the North sank a South Korean vessel and shelled civilians on a South Korean-held island.  That high bar could become achievable again. Third, the United States should bolster its extended deterrent framework -- or nuclear umbrella -- in East Asia. Today, some question U.S. willpower in the face of threats in the Asia Pacific region, particularly after the uncertain U.S. responses to aggression in Syria and Ukraine. A North Korean nuclear test would require the U.S. to make unambiguous statements about the defense of our allies and follow through with demonstrations of American capability, including deployments of assets like the B-2 bomber to Guam and increased exercises with Japan and Korea. North Korea is estimated to have enough fissile material now for between six and 12 nuclear weapons and is working hard on miniaturization and longer-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting not only Japan but someday, potentially, the United States.  At this rate, it will not be long before an American president is going to ask his staff who let North Korea develop the ability to threaten the United States with impunity and why more wasn't done to stop the North. We know that diplomacy has failed to knock the North off its goal and that a military strike would risk dangerous retaliation against Japan and Korea.  But in between war and diplomacy, we have a range of options that could constrict the North's program and buy us time until the threat can be removed peacefully through diplomacy or collapse of the onerous regime in Pyongyang.","North Korea may launch nuclear test to coincide with Obama's visit to South Korea .

"The battle for control of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, is shifting in favor of Iraqi and tribal forces fighting ISIS militants, Iraqi officials said Monday. Iraqi forces, with the help of coalition airstrikes, have pushed back ISIS militants and have retaken territory lost after ISIS fighters launched a coordinated assault on the city Friday. They have also regained control of the only military supply line into Ramadi from a nearby airbase, according to Faleh al-Issawi, the deputy governor of Anbar. While fighting continues in parts of Ramadi and in an eastern suburb, al-Issawi is optimistic Iraqi forces will be able to retake the city, but only if coalition airstrikes continue, he said. A fierce battle has been raging since Friday just 1,000 feet from the government complex of Anbar province that houses the regional government and security headquarters. Officials say that ISIS has retreated farther away and the fighting is less intense. At least 41 people have been killed including security forces, tribesmen and civilians since the fighting began Friday, officials said. Those casualties include 23 members of the al-Bu Fahd tribe who were found executed in one of the areas retaken from ISIS. ISIS still controls large parts of Anbar, but Iraqi forces say they've made progress in the past week in Diyala province with the help of coalition airstrikes. Iraqiya state TV has been reporting that the strategic towns of Jalawla and Saadiya, located a few kilometers apart, have been retaken by Kurdish Peshmerga forces, Iraqi military and police and Shiite militias. They retook Baiji refinery, the country's largest refinery that was lost to ISIS in June. Iraqiya TV also aired footage from the city of Khanaqin in the Diyala province showing Peshmerga fighters who were interviewed and talked about their readiness to fight ISIS.

"(CNN) -- It's the townhouse that twists like a Rubik's cube, to bask in the summer sun and shield itself when winter bites. Welcome to the transforming Sharifi-ha House in Tehran, Iran, where a normally static facade has been replaced by an adaptable, modular living space. Not content with luxury touches including a swimming pool, gym and cinema space, the seven-floor mansion has been designed to incorporate three rotating blocks that turn 90 degrees and transform the interior and exterior space. The design was grounded in need rather than luxury, say Tehran-based studio Next Office, the architects behind the new building. Temperatures in Iran can rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) or plummet well below freezing. Traditional Iranian houses cope with these extremes by incorporating an airy living room for summer and a separate, cosy living room for winter months. In the Sharifi-ha -- meaning Sharif's house, after its owner --rooms are transformed at the touch of a button. In the ""open"" mode, the three blocks pivot outwards on their rotating base, pointing the windowed ends to the sun, which also creates a terrace on each floor. ""Closed"" mode hides the windows to keep the house warm during Tehran's snowy winters. The original design -- which Alireza Taghaboni, lead designer at Next Office, claims also references traditional Iranian houses -- has earned the firm a nomination at the World Architecture Festival Awards. Inside the house, two basement floors provide fitness facilities and ""wellness areas,"" explains Taghaboni. Above a ground floor garage space and living quarters for a housekeeper, the top four floors comprise the home's communal areas. The two lowest moving ""blocks"" form a breakfast room and guest bedroom, while the upper block will be an office. Creating the rooms to turn on demand was no easy feat, say the architects. They puzzled over the interior handrails -- eventually redesigning them to fold as the rooms rotated. The turning mechanism for the rooms was, they say, the least of their worries -- the mechanical bases were already in use elsewhere -- as rotating sets in theaters or platforms for cars in showrooms. For the World Architecture Festival Award, the building will now go up against Vietnamese houses styled to become live-in plant pots, a concrete beach hut in Australia designed to withstand northern Queensland's tropical storms, and a Mexican villa that rises tree-like out of above its surrounding vegetation.

"A Greek investigative journalist was acquitted of criminal charges Thursday after he published the names of about 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts, a move that embarrassed the country's political and business elite. Kostas Vaxevanis, the editor of the magazine Hot Doc, was charged with violating Greece's data protection law. He was arrested on Sunday, a day after his magazine published the list, and acquitted Thursday night, defense attorney Harris Ikonomopoulos said. The names were known as the ""Lagarde list,"" because they were given by Christine Lagarde, then French finance minister, to her Greek counterpart in August 2010. Lagarde is now the International Monetary Fund chief. Vaxevanis defended his decision to publish on the grounds that the data came from a reliable source and that it was in the public interest for it to be released. ""In the last two years various names had been thrown about,"" he told reporters outside the courthouse Thursday. ""People had been blackmailed. Fake lists were circulated. The political system is being destabilized. There was a fake list that had half the Greek lawmakers' names on it. Doesn't this need to stop?"" While it is not illegal to hold a Swiss bank account, and there is no evidence that anyone broke the law, suspicions are high in Greece that some of those named in the list may have opened the accounts to avoid paying taxes to the Greek state. Greek media questioned whether the failure to investigate those named for possible tax evasion might have been the result of an attempt by politicians to protect a wealthy elite. A parliamentary committee is looking into why no investigation was carried out either under former Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou or his successor, Evangelos Venizelos. The ministers said the data had been handed over to the fraud office, but officials there said they had never been formally instructed to investigate who on the list was or wasn't dodging taxes. French and German authorities, who were given similar lists, did pursue some of those named for alleged tax evasion. Greek authorities now face public suspicion that they tried to shoot the messenger by sending Vaxevanis immediately to court, while for two years they effectively sat on the list and took no action. Ikonomopoulos said his client should have been praised for his courage in bringing the list to light rather than being taken to court. ""The Greek government needs to investigate this list and any other lists they may have their hands on,"" Ikonomopoulos told CNN. ""But first and foremost, the Greek government needs to reinstate effective governance, checks and balances and accountability and transparency mechanisms, in order for whatever is done to be productive,"" he said. ""We can't afford any more injustice, we can't afford any more mismanagement and we can certainly not afford lies that are smearing public life and are delegitimizing the public personnel in total at a time we need to work together.""","""People had been blackmailed ... doesn't this need to stop?""

"Washington (CNN) -- Toward the end of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's surprise appearance at the TED Women conference Wednesday, she told the story of a girl and her father in a developing country. ""This teenage girl's father expected to force her into early marriage, but she had been to school and she received a cow, perhaps through the Heifer project,  to encourage her to stay in school. When her father demanded she drop out of school and get married, she said no. When he insisted, she insisted right back. ""And finally she pulled out her trump card: 'If I leave and get married, I'm taking my cow, that cow belongs to me.' So guess what. She stayed in school, she was spared an early marriage, all because her father couldn't bear to part with the cow."" TED.com: Sheryl WuDunn on oppression of women . Clinton devoted her talk to the importance of empowering women and girls around the world, and the audience of 700 at the International Trade Center responded enthusiastically. ""Let women work and they drive economic growth across all sectors. Send a girl to school even just for one year and her income dramatically increases for life, and her children are more likely to survive and her family more likely to be healthier for years to come. Give women equal rights and entire nations are more stable and secure. Deny women equal rights and the instability of nations is almost certain."" Clinton said the goal of empowering women and girls is a ""central tenet"" of American foreign policy. ""Women's equality is not just a moral issue, it's not just a humanitarian issue, it is not just a fairness issue,"" she said, ""It is a security issue, it is a prosperity issue, and it is a peace issue. ""Therefore when I talk about why we need to integrate women's issues into discussions at the highest levels everywhere in the world, I'm not doing it just because I have a personal commitment or because President Obama cares about it. I'm doing it because it's in the vital interests of the United States of America."" Clinton said the status of women will be a key part of a new document the State Department is planning to release this week. Modeled on the Defense Department's review every four years of U.S. defenses, the ""quadrennial diplomacy and development review"" will assess American foreign policy. TED.com: Zainab Salbi on women and wartime . Clinton spoke of an array of initiatives and programs the State Department is using, many involving technology that can empower women. Among them is a program in the wartorn Democratic Republic of Congo that enables women who are the victims of violence to record and transmit their testimony in criminal cases through the use of mobile phones. Clinton's talk did not mention the ongoing worldwide controversy over the release of thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks. She did pay tribute to Elizabeth Edwards, who died the day before her talk. ""She lived with a fierce intelligence, a passion, a sense of purpose,"" Clinton said. ""She would have appreciated this event, where we are coming together to look for solutions."" The TED Women conference was a new event organized by TED, a nonprofit that runs conferences and makes talks available on its website, and by the Paley Center for Media. Clinton said the effort to empower women and girls faces cultural barriers: ""The low value that many families and societies place on girls makes possible many of the worst abuses they suffer. But even among girls who are spared the worst, too often it is a girl who is still the first to drop out of school, the last to be fed, the last to receive medical care. And in too many places, she is taught there are special limits to what is possible for her. ""We need to reach out to faith leaders and community leaders to change the perception and treatment of girls, and to persuade men and boys to value their sisters and their daughters, their talents and their intrinsic worth.""","Hillary Clinton spoke at the TED Women conference on U.S. policy on girls, women .

"(CNN)Few parents are delighted to learn that their daughter is a porn star, even a highly successful one. But for 21-year-old Mia Khalifa of Florida, a family dispute has taken on international dimensions. Khalifa is PornHub's highest-ranked adult star. But she is also Lebanese-born -- and her chosen line of work has not only disappointed her parents but generated huge controversy in her native country. The debate has gained such a head of steam that some Arab news outlets  published a family statement this week condemning Khalifa's actions and expressing the family's regret about her fame as a porn star. She is also criticized for her tattoo, in Arabic, of the opening lines of the Lebanese National Anthem. ""We are probably paying the price of living away from our homeland; our kids had to adapt to societies that don't  resemble our culture, traditions and values,"" the family statement said. ""Hence, we emphasize that we disassociate ourselves from her actions which do not reflect her family beliefs, her upbringing or  her true Lebanese roots. We hope that she comes back to her senses as her image does not honor her family or her homeland -- Lebanon."" According to the statement, Khalifa, born in 1993, moved with her family to the United States in 2000. They left behind them one of the more liberal countries in the Middle East but one where religion plays a central, sometimes divisive, role in daily life and many are deeply socially conservative. Having turned 18, Khalifa left home, the statement says, ""as is common in the West. She married an American guy in February 2011 and is currently living with him in Florida. Mia has since lost contact with her family."" Despite the family rift, Khalifa has been doing well for herself. And she's been fighting back against the criticism on her Twitter feed, which has more than 100,000 followers (and contains some slightly NSFW content). She writes: ""@borenstein_alex: @miakhalifa how do we achieve peace in the Middle East?"" Stop talking about pornstars that aren't living in your country"" But many critics continue to voice their disgust on Twitter. ""I am a Palestinian patriot and what you are doing is shameful,"" one person wrote. Another says her head should be cut off for what she's doing. And that's far from the only death threat she's received. She posted a doctored photo that appeared to show her as a prisoner of ISIS. At the same time, she has many online supporters. British-Lebanese author and publisher Nasri Atallah posted at length in her defense on his Facebook page. ""The moral indignation about Mia Khalifa, presumably the first Lebanese pornstar, is wrong for two reasons. First and foremost, as a woman, she is free to do as she pleases with her body,"" he wrote. ""Secondly, as a sentient human being with agency, who lives halfway across the world she is in charge of her own life and owes absolutely nothing to the country where she happened to be born. There is this odd perception that being Lebanese is a vocation and a duty first and that your personal life comes second."" And like Khalifah, Atallah believes the fevered interest her actions have stirred back home is unwarranted. ""For the record, I don't think we should be particularly proud of Mia Khalifa, we should just be indifferent. She's doing a job she chose, in a regulated industry, no different to banking. Actually, it's probably more regulated than banking. ""I certainly don't think she's our last frontier against ISIS as some have suggested. She is a 21-year old in Florida who has made a decision for herself, with absolutely no wider implications."" Another boost came from American duo Timeflies, who recorded a song about her this week, posted to their Twitter feed. It's already proven pretty popular with her fans, with several posting that, together, she and the band ""broke the internet."" And Khalifa herself remains defiant in the face of the trolls. ""How does it feel to be the most hated arab at the moment?"" she wrote. ""Pretty good since @Timeflies wrote a song about me."" CNN's Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","Mia Khalifa moved with her family from Lebanon to the United States as a child .

"(CNN) -- She is small but only in physical stature. Aung San Suu Kyi is the very embodiment of Myanmar's long struggle for democracy. The 65-year-old human rights activist has defied Myanmar's authoritarian military junta with her quiet demeanor and grace. For that she has endured house arrest for much of the past two decades and, perhaps, has become the world's most recognizable political prisoner. She has lived quietly by herself at her disintegrating Inya Lake villa in Yangon (the former capital, also known as Rangoon), accompanied solely by two maids. Before her release Saturday, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate had little outside human contact except for visits from her doctor. Sometimes, though, she was able to speak over the wall of her compound to her supporters, never once tiring of her crusade to break down the tyranny of dictatorship in her beloved homeland of Burma, the alternate name for Myanmar. Known as the ""lady"" in Myanmar, Suu Kyi has been compared to former South African President Nelson Mandela, who spent a chunk of his life in jail for fighting apartheid. In an interview with CNN several years earlier, Suu Kyi, in fact, likened Myanmar's plight to South Africa's former brutal race-based system. ""It's a form of apartheid,"" she said. ""In Africa, it was apartheid based on color. Here, it is apartheid based on ideas. It is as though those who want democracy are somehow of an alien inferior breed and this is not so."" The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi spent much of her early life abroad, going to school in India and at Oxford University in England. She never sought political office. Rather, leadership was bestowed upon her when she returned home in 1988 after her mother suffered a stroke. During her visit, a student uprising erupted and spotlighted her as a symbol of freedom. When Suu Kyi's mother died the next year, Suu Kyi vowed that just as her parents had served the people of Burma, so, too, would she. In her first public speech, she stood before a crowd of several hundred thousand people with her husband, Michael Aris, and her two sons and called for a democratic government. ""The present crisis is the concern of the entire nation,"" she said. ""I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to all that was going on. This national crisis could, in fact, be called the second struggle for independence."" She won over the Burmese people. One of them was Nyo Ohn Myint, who participated in the 1988 protests as a college professor and now serves as one of the leaders in Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. ""She is more than her father's daughter,"" he told CNN on Saturday. ""She has proven that she can bring together the Burmese people."" In 1989, the military regime threw her in jail. But even with Suu Kyi sitting behind bars, her party won the elections the following year by a landslide, gaining 82 percent of the seats in parliament. The regime ignored the results of the vote and Senior Gen. Than Shwe continued to impose numerous terms of house arrest on her. Suu Kyi, meanwhile, became the recipient of several human rights prizes and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Over the years, Suu Kyi has repeatedly challenged the junta and discouraged foreign investment in Myanmar. In one incident in 1998, soldiers prevented her from leaving Yangon. But Suu Kyi refused to turn back and was detained in her minivan for almost two weeks. The ordeal left her severely dehydrated, but was typical of her almost stubborn determination. ""She is the symbol of the hope for the people of Burma. If she is out today, the whole country will rise up, will follow her,"" said Khin Omar of the Network for Democracy and Development. Myint described her as energetic but humble. And a good listener. ""That's a skill I barely see in other people,"" Myint said. She has remained a devoted Buddhist who from the beginning admired the principles on non-violence and civil disobedience espoused by India's Mahatma Gandhi, Myint said. Over the years, Suu Kyi has made clear her devotion to bringing democracy to Myanmar. She has spoken of her separation from her loved ones as the sacrifice she chose to make for the freedom of her country. She has not seen her sons since 2000. The year before, her dying husband petitioned the Myanmar authorities to allow him to visit his wife. He had last seen her in 1995, but his request was rejected. Instead, the junta encouraged Suu Kyi to join her family abroad. But she said she knew that if she left, she would never be allowed to return. Aris died of prostate cancer in March 1999. Even before they were married, Suu Kyi had penned a letter to Aris professing her love of country. ""I only ask one thing,"" she wrote, ""that should my people need me, you would help me to do my duty by them."" Myint recalled calling her to express his condolences after Aris died in 1999. Suu Kyi was calm on the phone for the four-minute conversation but Myint could tell her heart was breaking. ""Maybe we are good at politics,"" Suu Kyi told Myint. ""But we are bad at family matters."" Suu Kyi tried to break the monotony of her life by playing her piano, another passion in her life, according to the independent Irrawaddy magazine. But in time, the piano warped and Suu Kyi turned to painting to fill the void, the magazine reported. One day, maybe, people will see her canvases. Suu Kyi has also asked her lawyers to bring her books in English and French. Last year, Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz was allowed to present her with his book ""Globalization and Its Discontent."" In 2007, people defiantly took to the streets to protest rising fuel costs. The demonstrations were seen as a direct challenge to the authority of the government. The regime answered with a brutal crackdown. Suu Kyi's detention was extended again and again. She appeared gaunt -- and unhappy. Even when Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar in May 2008, Suu Kyi was not allowed to leave her house, though trees were crashing down all around her. The following year, Myanmar was again propelled into the headlines by a bizarre incident involving an American, John Yettaw, who improvised flippers to swim Inya Lake to Suu Kyi's compound. He said he had received a message from God to do so. Yettaw was arrested, and Suu Kyi was put on trial, charged with harboring Yettaw, and was punished with another 18 months of house arrest. During the trial, she was able to meet with diplomats. High on her agenda was the election that was held this week. She and her party boycotted the vote, certain that it would be a sham. ""In Burma, the regime can control people but they cannot control her, they cannot shut her mouth,"" said analyst Win Min. ""They can release other political prisoners but they are worried that if they release her she will speak out."" The junta has organized national conventions to debate their version of a new democratic Myanmar. The road map makes no mention of Suu Kyi. Some believe that Suu Kyi's stubborn defiance has become an obstacle to progress in Myanmar. But her followers remain ardent in their admiration. She has clung to her dream of democracy, peace and freedom for Myanmar's 50 million impoverished people, they say. Those simple ideals have greatly complicated one woman's life.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy loves making birdies, but he's partial to the odd selfie too. And thanks to a late change of heart from Ryder Cup organizers, golf's world No. 1 can tweet to his heart's content at this week's transatlantic tussle between Europe and the United States. A ban on uploading pictures via social media during the tournament in Scotland has been reversed, which will no doubt please four-time major champion McIlroy and his 2.1 million-strong Twitter following. This pro-selfie stance reflects a growing shift in attitude from golf's authorities, with the 2014 Ryder Cup set to be the most socially connected in the team competition's 87-year history. ""Selfies are positively encouraged and I expect to see plenty of them,"" says its match director Edward Kitson. ""We want people to share their stories online and feel part of the Ryder Cup."" This commitment to sharing will also embrace ultrafast 4G wireless connection and radio frequency wristbands that allow fans to indulge in activities around the course and post their experiences to social media instantly. And while there are rules in place to minimize disruption to play, it is all a far cry from a six-year period between 2007 and 2012 when mobile phones were banned from the British Open after complaints from players. Sport has grown into one of the biggest draws on Twitter and Facebook, and a strong social media presence is now essential for any self-respecting major event. ""There's now an expectation among fans that their experience will include social media in some way,"" Caroline Cheese told CNN from the offices of UK-based LiveWire Sport, which counts the English Premier League and broadcaster Channel 4 among its clients. ""Events now see social strategy as a crucial part of the planning process -- not just a luxury add-on or afterthought. ""It doesn't just start when the event kicks off either. Events can start connecting with their fans months ahead, building a buzz, offering exclusive competitions and, in doing so, creating a loyal fanbase."" Even those fans who are in the stands at a sporting event are developing an appetite for in-game interaction. Thanks to reliable wifi across Hoylake's links at this year's British Open, many fans were able to watch the action right in front of them as well as follow TV coverage on a tablet or mobile phone. The concept of ""second-screening"" -- watching TV with a mobile, laptop or tablet to hand -- has become the norm in recent years thanks to the explosion in social media. Now clubs, and brands, are cottoning on to the opportunity it presents. Scottish football champion Celtic has earned plaudits for its in-stadium wifi network and dedicated matchday app -- only the second of its kind in Europe. The app provides text commentary, stats, images and interactive polls during a game, while pulling in the best of social media. It also encourages fans vote for a sponsor's man of the match. ""If you think about it, it is totally natural. You check your phone however many times a day, if you are at a live sporting event of course you want to do that,"" Niall Coen, managing director of Snack Media, the digital content wing of the app's developer, Sports Revolution, told CNN. ""It's human nature -- everyone wants to talk about the great goal they saw go in, or debate whether that was a red card or a penalty. ""When you see something that's important to you, you want to share with like-minded people around you and that's the basic premise of a lot of these social media business, not just sport. ""Part of the project at Celtic, and part of its success, is being able to fill that gap because when you have huge numbers of people together in one place you don't have the coverage and connectivity."" Future plans for the app include an ability for fans to buy tickets for matches or order food and drink to pick up during halftime. And as sport's social presence continues to evolve and technology gets better, Coen thinks it won't be long before event rights-holders themselves get in on the action. ""The likes of Twitter and Facebook are quite open about fact that sport is one of the biggest interests amongst their users,"" Coen added. ""One way it might go is some of the top rights-holders in sports and football might club together and do their own channel. ""Or maybe Twitter and Facebook could enhance their offering, with VIP areas that include a stream about a particular event, where you have all the very best commentators."" The recent World Cup underlined what an important accoutrement social media is for any global sporting event. A total of 672 million tweets relating to the football showpiece were sent during the tournament in Brazil -- a new record according to Twitter. The 35.6 million tweets sent during Brazil's humiliating 7-1 defeat to eventual winner Germany was the most sent during a single sporting event. And it shows that whether inside the stadium or not, the online debate around the game is growing ever larger. ""Fans aren't passive anymore, they want to feel part of the event and social is crucial in that,"" Cheese explained. ""It allows events to deliver behind-the-scenes content, competitions, hashtag initiatives to allow fans to connect with each other and to the event itself. ""Perhaps its most crucial role -- especially for really big events -- is in bringing together a global audience. ""For example, the Premier League -- and many of its clubs -- engages directly with its millions of fans in China via channels like Sina Weibo. ""The big match might be taking place in Manchester but its reach is way, way bigger than that.""","Ryder Cup organizers encourage selfies and sharing via social media at event .

"George Zimmerman was charged Monday with felony aggravated assault after allegedly pointing a shotgun at his girlfriend, according to Dennis Lemma, chief deputy with the Seminole County, Florida, Sheriff's Office. Zimmerman, who was acquitted earlier this year of murdering teenager Trayvon Martin, was arrested after the incident at the home of Samantha Scheibe, Lemma said. He also was charged with two misdemeanors --  domestic violence battery and criminal mischief -- in connection with the same incident, Lemma said. Zimmerman is being held in jail without bail and will make his first appearance in front of a judge Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. ET. Differing 911 calls . According to a police report on the incident, Scheibe said that after an argument Zimmerman broke a table with a shotgun then pointed it at her ""for a minute."" Scheibe called 911 at 12:30 E.T., Lemma said. On a 911 call recording released by police, a woman can be heard telling authorities: ""He's inside my house breaking all my (things) because I asked him to leave."" The woman then says to someone at the house, ""I'm doing this again? You just broke my glass table. You just broke my sunglasses and you put your gun in my freaking face and told me to get the (expletive) out."" A man is heard telling her to calm down, but then she tells the dispatcher that the man just pushed her out of the house and locked the door. On a separate 911 call, a man calls to report that his girlfriend was ""for lack of a better term, going crazy on me"" and throwing his things out. The caller says the woman is outside with police. When asked why he is calling, the man says, ""I just want everyone to know the truth."" He says he never pulled a firearm and that it is in a bag, locked. He claims she was the one who broke the table. When deputies arrived at the house, Scheibe gave them a key. When they pushed open the door -- which was blocked by several small pieces of furniture -- they found Zimmerman, who was sitting and unarmed, Lemma said. He was passive and cooperative, Lemma said. The sheriff's office was seeking a search warrant to look for two guns deputies believed were inside the home, he said. According to the police report, Zimmerman had locked up the guns before police arrived. Recent contact with authorities . This is one of several brushes that Zimmerman has had with law enforcement since he was acquitted this year of murder and manslaughter in the 2012 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin. Earlier this month, police in Lake Mary, Florida, said no charges would result from an alleged domestic dispute in September between George Zimmerman and his estranged wife, Shellie Zimmerman. Shellie Zimmerman said in September that she has doubts about his innocence in the Trayvon Martin case. Since his acquittal in the Martin case, Zimmerman also has been stopped for speeding twice. He was pulled over the first time in Forney, Texas, in July and told the police officer he had a concealed weapon permit and a gun in his glove compartment. The officer wrote on his incident report that he gave Zimmerman a verbal warning. Zimmerman was pulled over in early September going 60 mph in a 45-mph zone in Lake Mary and received a $256 ticket. He was not carrying a weapon at the time. National headlines . Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the Sanford neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin's father lived in February 2012. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin, 17, in self-defense. Zimmerman was acquitted by a six-person jury in July on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The high-profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. His attorney in the murder trial, Mark O'Mara, no longer represents him. Zimmerman's wife has doubts about his innocence .","Women tells 911 that man is breaking things with gun because she asked him to leave .

"(CNN) -- Myanmar's ruling military junta freed democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest Saturday to a throng of joyous supporters who rushed toward her house once the gates were opened. Many tried to reach out and shake Suu Kyi's hand as she appeared at the fence surrounding her lakeside home in Yangon. Someone handed her flowers, which she put in her hair in trademark fashion. It was a small gesture but significant in that the flowers have become a symbol of defiance in Myanmar. ""I'm very happy to see you all again,"" she said, reconnecting with the people after being hidden from the public eye for so long. It was difficult to hear Suu Kyi, her voice drowned out by the cheering crowd. But according to the independent Irrawaddy magazine, she said: ""We have not seen each other for a long time. There are so many things to talk about."" She promised to address her supporters Sunday at the headquarters of her National League for Democracy party headquarters. Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace Prize recipient in 1991, has spent 15 of the past 21 years under house arrest for her dogged opposition to authoritarian rule in the nation formerly known as Burma. Recently, she had little outside human contact except for two maids and visits from her doctor. Sometimes, she spoke to supporters over the wall of her compound. U.S. President Barack Obama said he admired Suu Kyi's courage. ""While the Burmese regime has gone to extraordinary lengths to isolate and silence Aung San Suu Kyi, she has continued her brave fight for democracy, peace, and change in Burma,"" he said in a statement Saturday. ""She is a hero of mine and a source of inspiration for all who work to advance basic human rights in Burma and around the world. The United States looks forward to the day when all of Burma's people are free from fear and persecution."" This was the third time the regime has released Suu Kyi from house arrest. The media in Myanmar, under tight state control, barely reported her release, showing only footage of her meeting with military officials. Bono, the lead singer of the rock band U2 whose 2001 hit song ""Walk On"" was dedicated to Suu Kyi, expressed fears that she could be more vulnerable now but said he hoped her release would lead to constructive political dialogue. ""(I am) very thrilled at the possibility this might be the beginning of some sort of rational discussion with the people of Burma by the military junta. But we're not sure,"" Bono, a longtime political activist, told CNN. ""For this to be real, there has to be progress toward real peace."" Security has been stepped up in Myanmar, but it was unclear whether it was related to Suu Kyi's release or the country's first elections in two decades that were held last Sunday. Though Suu Kyi has had minimal contact with the outside world, reports from her domestic lawyer indicate she is in good spirits, said Jared Genser, another one of her lawyers, who is based in the United States. ""I am personally delighted for her, for her family,"" Genser said. But he tempered his joy with words of caution. ""I don't speak on her behalf as to what comes next,"" Genser said. ""The challenges are enormous."" He said it was unclear whether anything would fundamentally change in Myanmar, given the recent ""sham"" elections in the country. Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty International's Myanmar specialist, said it made ""perfect sense"" for the regime to free her since she was no longer an electoral threat to them. Suu Kyi's opposition party won the 1990 elections by a landslide but the regime never recognized those results. The election Sunday was the first since then but Suu Kyi was barred from participating because of a recent conviction. The ruling military junta has been slowly releasing official election results, but critics say a victory for the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party is all but certain. The government has refused to allow CNN and other international news organizations into the country to cover the election and its aftermath. It has also prevented international monitors from overseeing the vote. The Burma Campaign UK, which promotes human rights in Myanmar, accused the ruling junta of rigging the November 7 election. The group welcomed Suu Kyi's release but warned that it should not be interpreted as a sign that democratic reform is on the way. ""The release of Aung San Suu Kyi is about public relations, not democratic reform,"" said Zoya Phan, International Coordinator at Burma Campaign UK. ""I am thrilled to see our democracy leader free at last, but the release is not part of any political process, instead it is designed to get positive publicity for the dictatorship after the blatant rigging of elections on 7th November,"" Phan said. Suu Kyi's latest house arrest came after she was found guilty of breaching the terms of her house arrest after American John Yettaw swam uninvited to house and briefly stayed there. The regime passed a law that made her ineligible for Sunday's elections because of that conviction. Over the years, Suu Kyi has repeatedly challenged the junta and discouraged foreign investment in Myanmar. In one incident in 1998, soldiers prevented her from leaving Yangon. But Suu Kyi refused to turn back and was detained in her minivan for almost two weeks. ""She is the symbol of the hope for the people of Burma. If she is out today the whole country will rise up, will follow her,"" said Khin Omar of the Network for Democracy and Development.

"Polish football officials were left red-faced on Tuesday after their World Cup qualifier against England was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch -- despite Warsaw's national stadium boasting a retractable roof. A heavy downpour started more than four hours before the match but the roof on the stadium was never closed, so allowing the pitch to become unplayable. ""It's up to the people whose responsibility it is to run the stadium for them to decide when the roof needs to be on, or if it needs to be on,"" England manager Roy Hodgson said. ""No one will be more disappointed than them that the roof hadn't gone on and the pitch was playable."" World governing body FIFA delayed kick-off to see if conditions improved but the referee called the game off 45 minutes after it should have started, rescheduling the match for Wednesday afternoon. The 58,000-capacity stadium was specifically built for the 2012 European Championship, at a cost of nearly $650 million, which Poland co-hosted in June along with neighbors Ukraine. Polish organizers later stated that they were unable to take a unilateral decision to open or close a roof since they needed clearance from FIFA to do so. ""It takes 15 minutes to close the roof. However, this cannot happen in a temperature below zero, with very strong wind, and rain deposited on the folded  roof,"" added Daria Kuklinska, a spokeswoman for the stadium operator. It was a mixed night for England, whose Under-21 side qualified for next year's European Championship when beating Serbia in a game in Krusevac that ended with ugly scenes and the visitors reporting ""a number of incidents of racism"" to European governing body UEFA. ""The FA condemns both the scenes of racism and the confrontation at the final whistle during which time our players and staff were under extreme provocation,"" said the English FA in a statement. Among the World Cup qualifiers that were played on Tuesday, Germany were held 4-4 at home by Sweden despite leading by four goals with an hour gone. A brace from Miroslav Klose had helped Germany assume a seemingly unassailable lead in Berlin only for Sweden to take advantage of an uncharacteristic lack of German resilience, as Rasmus Elm dramatically earned a point deep in the 93rd minute. Another team to be denied in the last minute were Spain, whose remarkable run of 24 consecutive wins in qualifying games -- which stretched back to 2007 -- was ended when drawing 1-1 at home to 1998 World Cup winners France in Madrid. Sergio Ramos gave the world and European champions an early lead which Cesc Fabregas failed to double when his first-half penalty  was saved -- leaving the visitors to earn a deserved point when Olivier Giroud headed home deep in stoppage time. Elsewhere, an historic night for Cristiano Ronaldo -- who was winning his 100th cap for Portugal -- was upstaged by visitors Northern Ireland, who led for large parts of the game in Porto before Helder Postiga earned a 1-1 draw just ten minutes from time. Ronaldo had started the night in high spirits as he was presented  with a special cap to mark the occasion but after the match, the Real Madrid star left the pitch in pouring rain sporting a face like thunder. In other games, Russia needed a fortuitous 84th minute penalty to defeat Azerbaijan 1-0 in Moscow, Belgium continued their impressive form when beating Scotland 2-0 at home while Italy made light of losing Pablo Osvaldo to a red card after 46 minutes as they won 3-1 in Milan against Denmark.

"The world's most valuable club Manchester United has penned a new multi-million dollar deal with U.S. insurance giant Aon as part of an aggressive marketing strategy aimed at driving revenue through sponsorship. One of 36 companies that now sponsor Manchester United, Aon will sign an eight-year contract to brand the club's training kit and attach its name to United's Carrington training ground. The deal, which runs until 2021, is reportedly worth £15 million [$23 million] a season and will see the training ground renamed Aon Training Complex. It is the first time the Premier League giants have sold the branding rights to their coveted training ground on the outskirts of Manchester and represents another step in the club's strategy to drive up revenues. For the 2011/2012 season, United increased revenues by £14.2 million to £117.6 million, the highest of any club in the Premier League, and have sponsorship deals with companies from Indonesian tyremakers to China Construction Bank. United players and coaches, including manager Alex Ferguson, will also wear Aon branded training kits at all friendly and competitive  domestic fixtures as well as during training sessions. Aon will have access to the club's training grounds to entertain clients and host corporate events. Announcing the partnership, Manchester United Commercial Director Richard Arnold said in a statement: ""I am delighted that this cements our relationship with Aon for a further eight years."" Additionally, the London-based insurer will act as a presenting partner for Manchester United, nicknamed the 'Red Devils,' on its pre-season tour of Asia this summer. Aon said 'Tour 2013' will focus on the Club's 325 million followers in Asia with matches planned in Bangkok, Sydney, Yokohama, Osaka and Hong Kong. Phil Clement, Aon's Global Chief Marketing Officer said: ""This announcement is the next step in the evolution of our partnership with Manchester United."" He added: ""It is a privilege for Aon to be associated with the world-famous Manchester United training facility."" In October, Manchester United cashed in on a four-year deal with training kit partner DHL anticipating that they could make more money from another sponsor. Aon is currently the club's main kit sponsor but is set to be replaced by Chevrolet for the start of the 2014-2015 season after the club signed a seven-year deal with the U.S. carmaker in July. Manchester United, owned by the American Glazer family, look set to win a record 20th league title this season, holding an unassailable 15-point lead over their fierce rivals Manchester City. The league leaders are set to host reigning champions Manchester City in a local derby at Old Trafford on Monday.","Aon will sign an eight-year contract to brand the club's training kit and United's Carrington training ground .

"Cairo (CNN)The actions of the Islamic State are anything but Islamic, and Muslims must battle extremism to maintain the religion's message of mercy, the grand mufti of Egypt told CNN. Sheikh Shawky Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam spoke about the recent execution of a Jordanian pilot at the hands of ISIS. Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh, 27, was burned alive while confined in a cage. ""What happened to the Jordanian pilot is by all means a crime. This barbaric action is far away from humanity, much less religions. Islam is innocent of this act,"" the grand mufti said on Thursday. Allam leads Dar El-Ifta, or the House of Fatwas, the premier authority in Islamic legal interpretations. The institution was founded in 1895, although the grand muftis of Egypt have been interpreting Islam for 800 years. It releases more than 500,000 edicts a year. The battle is ideological, Allam said, and the fight is not confined to Egypt or the Middle East. ""Violence and radicalization have become an international phenomenon that has no home or belief. But it runs through the entire world,"" he said. The pilot's death was captured in a horrific video that was posted online this week. ISIS has distributed footage of its executions before, but previous videos showed beheadings. The grand mufti weighed whether beheadings could ever be justified by Islam. He considered the example of Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the region. There, defendants may be sentenced to death and beheaded. ""What happens in Saudi Arabia is based on judicial investigations and implementing the predominant law. If it is the case, then we respect the rule of law in this state,"" Allam said. By contrast, he argued, ISIS does not follow any system of investigation. ""Everything ISIS does is far away from Islam. What it is doing is a crime by all means,"" the grand mufti said. Earlier this year, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi called for a ""religious revolution."" Allam believes in the need for reform, but he also believes the foundation of Islam must remain untouched. What does this mean? It means ""renewing the methods, renewing the tools, and renewing the way Islam's teachings are presented, "" Allam said. ""At the same time, we preserve and uphold the stable pillars of religion. Rattling the pillars leads to destabilizing communities."" In an effort to reclaim the voice of Islam from radical groups, Dar Al-Ifta issues publications in 10 languages, engages in awareness campaigns and joins regional and international efforts to battle extremist ideas and to present a better image of Islam. The grand mufti's advice to young Muslims is to seek specialized scholars to understand the true meaning of Islam. ""We tell youth, Islam didn't carry a message of sabotage and destruction. It only came to serve humanity, to achieve world peace and bring mercy to the world,"" he said.","Grand mufti of Egypt says actions of ISIS are far from Islamic .

"""Made in America"" is a phrase rarely seen in the apparel industry. And while many clothing companies rely on retailers to distribute their products, one apparel company is steering clear of store fronts and selling their American-made clothing direct to consumers. Smart Business meets Bayard Winthrop, founder of San Francisco-based American Giant. CNN: American Giant has no stores or marketing campaigns, and is sold strictly online. How do you compete with other manufacturers? Bayard Winthrop: One of the big, dirty secrets in the apparel industry is that so much of the cost of what we pay for in our shirts and our pants is chewed up in distribution costs and big traditional marketing budgets. We're entering into a time where consumers are caring less and less about the corner store, the mall store and big traditional marketing budgets. What American Giant is trying to do is not invest in those things and invest much more in the things that matter to customers and putting a lot of money into materials and into craftsmanship and into American-made products, so it really is looking at trying to be a part of this whole new wave of e-commerce. CNN: More than 97% of apparel sold in the US Is made in other countries, and eight out of 10 shoes bought in the US are made in China. Why is this? BW: One of the great misconceptions about the cost of American-made manufacturing versus the cost of manufacturing overseas is that I can pay a worker overseas something less than what I could pay an American worker.  And that's true. But what's lost in that very blunt analysis is if you think about what it takes to manufacture well overseas, there's a lot of distance, a lot of language barriers, a lot of time differentials, a lot of quality controlling that you're doing online or on the phone that you're not doing in person.  If you actually monetize all of those things, I think that the difference between manufacturing overseas and manufacturing domestic is actually a lot less than most people think. CNN: What benefits do you see by having your entire manufacture-base in the US? BW: By having our supply chain domestic it means that we can very easily be in very close contact with the people that are growing our cotton, spinning our yarn and making our garments. CNN: What are the challenges of having an online-only store? BW: One thing that traditional retail does pretty well is having a whole bunch of stores out there, which gets the word out easier. It's a vehicle to get the brand messaging out there. We rely on word of mouth. We rely on selling a sweat shirt to somebody that thinks it's of such high quality and we're standing for something that matters to them that they in turn will talk about it and become a fan and be loyal. We fundamentally believe that at the end of the day, it comes down to the product, and if you build a great product, customers are going to say: 'I'm gonna pick up the banner and talk about the brand and talk about the business.'","Manufacturers American Giant produce all of their clothing in the United States .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City booked its place in the last-16 of the Champions League following a 2-0 victory over Roma on Wednesday. Samir Nasri's stunning 60th minute strike and Pablo Zabaleta's late effort gave City all three points and secured second place in Group E behind Bayern Munich. Roma, who hit the post in the second half through Kostas Manolas, also had an effort cleared off the line. But City held out to ensure its place in the knockout phase of the competition. ""I think the performance of the team was amazing,"" Nasri told Sky Sports. ""It was important for me to score, after the surgery I took a while to get to my full level, now I am."" The result was even more of an achievement for City given the absence of three of its star players. Sergio Aguero, who scored a hat-trick in the 3-2 win over Bayern Munich was ruled out with a knee injury, while captain Vincent Kompany failed to shake off a hamstring problem. City was also without its talisman midfielder Yaya Toure, who was suspended after being sent off during the 2-1 defeat by CSKA Moscow. A tense opening hour was finally brought to life by Nasri who produced a wonderful piece of skill to give his side the lead. The Frenchman's shot from 20-yards flew off the post and into the net to stun the home side. Roma, now requiring two goals to progress, came close with Joe Hart making a number of important saves before Manolas' header struck the post. The home side continued to push forward in search of an equalizer but Mattia Destro's effort was hacked off the line as City's nerves began to fray. But with four minutes of normal time remaining, City broke at speed and Nasri played in Zabaleta to fire into the far corner. ""We recovered our normal performance, playing good pressing and playing well with the ball,"" Manuel Pellegrini, the Manchester City manager, told Sky Sports. ""We are a solid team, we are recovering the ball in the correct way. I had a lot of trust in what we could do. I said I didn't want to talk about players not in the team. This team deserve a little more credit than the press always give us."" Bayern Munich, which had already won the group, defeated CSKA Moscow 3-0 courtesy of goals from Thomas Muller, Sebastian Rode and Mario Gotze. In Group F, Barcelona sealed top spot with a convincing 3-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, once of Barcelona, gave the visiting team the lead before Lionel Messi equalized with his 75th goal in the competition. Neymar and Luis Suarez added further strikes to ensure Barcelona will face a team which finished second in its group when the draw is made on Monday. In the same group, Ajax thrashed Cypriot side Apoel Nicosia 4-0 in Amsterdam. Chelsea rounded off its group stage campaign with a 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon at Stamford Bridge. Cesc Fabregas, Andre Schurrle and Jon Obi Mikel scored the goals for Chelsea while Schalke's 1-0 win at Maribor allowed the German club to take second spot in Group G. Elsewhere, Porto and Shakhtar, both already through to the next stage, drew 1-1 while Athletic Bilbao claimed a 2-0 win over Bate Borisov . The Belarussian side has the rather dubious honor of having conceded the most goals ever in the history of the competition's group stage, beating the previous record of 22 held by Dinamo Zagreb and Nordsjaelland .","Manchester City claims 2-0 victory at AS Roma .

"(CNN)It was a story that sounded like something out of a horror film: Two young brothers strangled by a 100-pound snake that came crashing through the ceiling as they slept. But this was no work of fiction. It was the all-too-real fate suffered by brothers Connor and Noah Barthe in August 2013 at a sleepover in the home of Jean-Claude Savoie, a family friend who lived above an exotic pet store that he ran in New Brunswick, Canada. Though deemed a tragic accident from the outset, the incident nevertheless remained under investigation, and on Thursday, 18 months later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced that it had ""arrested an individual in connection with the deaths of Noah and Connor Barthe of Campbellton, (New Brunswick)."" Leslie Matchim, an attorney for Savoie, confirmed that his client was the one arrested. ""It remains to be seen if there will be charges,"" Matchim said on Thursday. A call and email to the Crown Prosecutor's Office was not immediately returned. Savoie was arrested in Montreal, where he has since relocated, some 500 miles away from his Reptile Ocean pet store, according to Matchim. He remained in custody there Thursday night. According to CBC, the African rock python was kept in a glass enclosure similar to an aquarium, but on the night of the sleepover it slithered into the ventilation system. It was above the living room, where Connor, 6, and Noah, 4, were sleeping, when the ceiling caved in. Autopsy results revealed that the boys died from asphyxiation.","Pet store owner Jean-Claude Savoie arrested in connection with 2013 deaths of young brothers .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN)Shortages of basic products such as corn, milk and chicken have plagued Venezuela for years, creating long lines at supermarkets and pushing inflation well past the 60% mark just in the last year alone. More recently, shortages are affecting people in the South American country in a more personal way.  Venezuelan consumers complain condoms and birth control pills are nowhere to be found.  Shortages that first affected the dining table have now made their way into the bedroom. CNN visited eight pharmacies in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital.  Four had no condoms at all and the other four had limited availability.  A couple only carried only one domestic brand. Yuraima Bacher, a pharmacy manager, said her establishment doesn't get supplies with the frequency they once did. ""Can you believe it?  It's been two weeks [since the last shipment].  Things have been slow since early January, and it's been the same thing so far this month,"" Bacher said. Venezuelans are turning to Mercado Libre, or Free Market. It's a website similar to eBay where consumers buy and sell all kinds of products. One subscriber is selling a box of 36 condoms for 4,760 bolivars.   That's a whopping $755 U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate.  It's also 85% of the Venezuelan monthly minimum salary, currently at 5,602 bolivars. President Nicolas Maduro announced in June his government was building a condom factory to supply the domestic market.  The factory was built, but pharmacy managers say quality has not been what their customers demand.  Production levels are not meeting domestic demand either. Magdymar Leon, a coordinator at the Venezuelan Association for an Alternative Sexual Education, says public health experts worry the scarcity of contraception methods might have long-term consequences. ""What are the implications? One is that the individual doesn't have the means to control a decision to have children or not.  That right is lost.  On the other hand, the ability to protect oneself from sexually transmitted diseases is also lost,"" Leon said. A 2012 World Bank study shows Venezuela has the fifth-highest teen pregnancy rate out of 21 Latin American countries. The HIV infection rate, at 0.6% of the general population, is also a serious concern for public health analysts, a risk than can only increase unless Venezuelan authorities take measures to address shortages of contraception methods.

"(CNN) -- He's yet to score a Premier League goal for Liverpool, but Mario Balotelli can claim one first in 2014 -- he had the most retweeted message of the World Cup. Balotelli's irreverent promise to kiss Britain's Queen Elizabeth II if Italy beat Costa Rica in their World Cup group game was retweeted nearly 173,000 times and favorited over 88,000 times. ""If we beat Costa Rica i want a kiss, obviously on the cheek, from the UK Queen,"" tweeted Balotelli, who joined Liverpool from AC Milan after the World Cup. It's unknown if the Queen was relieved after Italy were surprisingly beaten 1-0 by Costa Rica. ""Eight of the UK's 10 most tweeted about moments in 2014 were sport related, in a year that saw the World Cup and Champions League dominate the major talking points on the platform,"" said a Twitter spokesman. Over 35 million tweets were sent during World Cup hosts Brazil's humiliating 7-1 semifinal defeat by Germany to set a new record for the most-discussed live event on Twitter, with 672 million tweets relating to the tournament delivered. Balotelli might have had the most retweeted message during hte World Cup, but the Liverpool forward's Twitter account of just over three million followers is dwarfed by that of Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo who surpassed the 30 million mark this year. Footballers take eight of the top 10 places of the most globally followed athletes, with basketball stars LeBron James and Kevin Durant fighting the NBA's corner. There was a greater mix of sports stars in the 10 most followed British athletes, with Andy Murray, diver Tom Daley, Lewis Hamilton, Rory McIlroy and cricketer Kevin Pietersen giving the likes of Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Gareth Bale, Joey Barton and Ashley Cole a run for their money.

Arguably 2014's most memorable sport selfie was Lukas Podolski's photographic celebrations to commemorate Germany's World Cup final win over Argentina.

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- A Colorado man was convicted of first-degree murder and a bias-motivated crime and sentenced to life in prison for killing a transgender teen he met on an online social networking site. Allen Andrade was convicted of first-degree murder and a hate crime in the slaying of a transgender teen. It was the first time in the nation that a state hate crime statute resulted in a conviction in a transgender person's murder, the advocacy group Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation said. Seated in the front row of the courtroom, the family of Angie Zapata broke out in tears as the verdicts against Allen Andrade were read Wednesday. The jury deliberated for just under two hours before returning the verdict shortly after 3 p.m.  Watch Andrade listen to the verdict » . ""I lost somebody so precious,"" said Maria Zapata, the victim's mother. She glanced at Andrade and continued: ""The only thing he can't take away is the love and the memories that I have of my baby. My beautiful, beautiful baby."" Andrade spoke just one word. ""No,"" he said when asked if he wished to address the court. Judge Marcelo Kopcow then imposed the mandatory sentence for the first-degree murder conviction -- life in prison without parole.  Watch Andrade get sentenced to life without parole » . The verdict was hailed by gay and transgender rights groups. ""This is a landmark decision,"" said Mindy Barton, the legal director of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center of Colorado. Barton attended the trial daily. ""Hearing 'guilty on first-degree murder' and 'guilty of bias-motivated crime' was a hugely emotional experience for all the family, friends and the supporters of Angie,"" Barton added. ""She will not be forgotten."" Andrade admitted killing Zapata, but his defense argued that he acted in the heat of passion after discovering that Zapata was biologically male. The defense asked for a lesser verdict, such as second-degree murder or manslaughter. Throughout the trial, prosecutors referred to Zapata as ""she,"" while the defense referred to the transgender teen, who was born Justin Zapata, as ""he."" ""When [Andrade] met him, he met him as 'Angie,' "" defense attorney Annette Kundelius argued on Wednesday. ""When he found out it wasn't 'Angie,' that it was 'Justin,' he lost control."" But the jury rejected the argument, deciding in favor of prosecutors, who argued that Andrade knew Zapata was biologically male and that knowledge motivated the crime. ""This was an ambush attack,"" said Chief Deputy District Attorney Robb Miller. ""This was an all-out blitz."" Zapata was ""born in a boy's body but living as a female,"" added Miller. ""Ultimately, she was murdered because of it."" The case has become a rallying point for supporters of the transgender community, who have held vigils and launched Web sites in remembrance of Zapata. They are calling for the inclusion of transgender people in hate crime statutes across the country and at the federal level. Currently, 11 states and the District of Columbia recognize transgender people in their hate crime laws. According to prosecutors, Zapata, 18, and Andrade, 32, met online in summer 2008 and arranged to meet. Zapata brought Andrade to her apartment in Greeley, Colorado, where they spent nearly three days together. According to a police affidavit, Zapata was out of the apartment when Andrade noticed photographs that made him ""question victim Zapata's sex."" Andrade confronted Zapata, who declared, ""I am all woman."" Andrade then grabbed Zapata and discovered male genitalia. According to court records, Andrade told police he began hitting Zapata with his fists, knocking her to the ground. He then grabbed a fire extinguisher and twice hit her in the head. Andrade told police he thought he had ""killed it,"" referring to Zapata, and covered her with a blanket. Realizing what he had done, he then cleaned up the crime scene, the affidavit said. Andrade told police he heard ""gurgling"" sounds coming from the victim and saw Zapata sitting up. He hit her again with the fire extinguisher, he said, according to the affidavit. Andrade took Zapata's car and fled. Police discovered the car two weeks later and arrested Andrade. The jury heard jailhouse phone conversations, including Andrade telling a girlfriend ""gay things must die."" He did not testify in his own defense. Zapata was 16 when she adopted the name ""Angie,"" and made the decision to live as a woman.","Allen Andrade guilty of murder, bias crime in teen's slaying .

"James Franco won't be following Dennis Rodman into North Korea anytime soon. Franco's latest movie -- a comedy about two talk show hosts who are asked to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- has earned the distinction of a frothing rant from the regime in Pyongyang. ""The enemies have gone beyond the tolerance limit in their despicable moves to dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership,"" a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman told the country's state-run news agency Wednesday. The film, titled ""The Interview,"" stars Franco and Seth Rogen as two lightweight talk show hosts recruited by the CIA to take out Kim. It's not due in theaters until October, but the trailer is already drawing worldwide attention, including in the corridors of power in Pyongyang. 'Team America' The distribution of the movie is ""the most undisguised terrorism and a war action to deprive the service personnel and people of the DPRK of their mental mainstay and bring down its social system,"" the North Korean spokesman raged, using an abbreviation of the authoritarian country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Comedians taking shots at North Korea's dictatorial leadership is hardly new -- it goes back at least a generation. A decade ago, ""Team America: World Police"" used puppets to lampoon Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, memorably featuring him singing about his loneliness at the top of the despotic state. Kim Jong Il also popped up as a waiter in NBC's ""Thirty Rock"" -- albeit one who claimed to be ""the greatest waiter of all time."" Brutal regime . The situation in North Korea is no joke. A recent United Nations commission detailed a horrifying list of crimes it says the regime has committed against its own people, including the large-scale use of prison camps and torture. The cold-blooded brutality of the system was displayed late last year when Kim Jong Un's uncle was purged and executed. Meanwhile, the isolated state continues to develop its nuclear weapons program, which it has used to threaten neighboring countries and the United States. Will Kim watch? But like his father, Kim Jong Un has also brought about bizarre moments in his two and a half years in power, such as his basketball-based friendship with Rodman. Such peculiar behavior, along with the secrecy in which the regime cloaks itself, is hard for comedians to resist. The Telegraph last week cited Kim Myong-chol, the executive director of the Centre for North Korea-U.S. Peace and a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, as suggesting that Kim would probably watch the new movie. That prompted glee from Rogen, who also co-directed and wrote the film. ""Apparently Kim Jong Un plans on watching #TheInterview. I hope he likes it!!"" he tweeted. 'Towering hatred' But the North Korean government showed little sign of favor toward the film on Wednesday, accusing the United States of ""bribing a rogue movie maker"" to produce it. And it warned that Franco and Rogen's comedy, which it said had touched off ""the towering hatred and wrath of the service personnel and people of the DPRK,"" would have consequences. ""Those who defamed our supreme leadership and committed the hostile acts against the DPRK can never escape the stern punishment to be meted out according to a law wherever they might be in the world,"" the foreign ministry spokesman said. ""If the U.S. administration connives at and patronizes the screening of the film, it will invite a strong and merciless countermeasure.""","A new comedy starring James Franco is about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un .

"(CNN)The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will soon add Miami Seaquarium's killer whale, Lolita, to the endangered species list, but nothing will change for the longtime Miami entertainer. At 49, the senior whale will be added to the endangered listing for the Southern Resident Killer Whales found in the waters off Seattle, where Lolita was captured in 1970. The Southern Resident population was depleted between 1965 and 1975 because of captures conducted for marine parks, according to NOAA Fisheries.  The population's numbers remain low due to such environmental factors as pollution, oil spills and noise from passing vessels, NOAA says. As a result, the Southern Resident killer whales were added to the endangered species 10 years ago. Animal activists, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Animal Legal Defense Fun and the Orca Network see this ruling as a victory. ""It's Lolita's chance of freedom,"" said Jared Goodman, PETA's director of animal law. ""It's a huge step."" Activists petitioned NOAA to include Lolita to the Southern Resident endangered list, saying they never had the right to separate her from designation for the Seattle killer whale population. About 17,000 comments were submitted to the federal agency in support of the endangered designation for Lolita. Animal rights activists want Lolita eventually released back into the wild if she can be rehabilitated to survive on her own after 40 years of captivity where she is hand-fed instead of capturing her own food. Websites such as SaveLolita (savelolita.org) and protests like one in Miami where hundreds marched for the release of Lolita. Activists say they have a plan to move Lolita from Miami to a privately owned cove at San Juan Island in Washington. There, Lolita could be rehabilitated from captivity and taught to forage for her own food, says Goodman. The activists admit Lolita might never survive a release in the open ocean for a number of reasons. Keiko, from the movie ""Free Willy,"" died only three years after being returned to the ocean. Miami Seaquarium says Lolita's is not going anywhere. ""Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years,"" says Robert Rose, Miami Seaquarium Curator. ""Lolita is healthy and thriving in her home, where she shares her habitat with Pacific white-sided dolphins,"" who perform two shows daily says the curator. Rose and NOAA say the endangered designation does not required the killer whale to be released back into the wild. Plus any such movement of a killer whale would need a NOAA Fishery permit and extensive review. ""We are going to do everything to protect her (Lolita),"" said the PETA attorney. That would include suing anyone who harms the endangered killer whale. What constitutes harm could ultimately be decided by a federal judge. Miami Seaquarium is one of the oldest marine parks in the United States, and activists say Lolita's  habitat is not big enough. They are suing the federal government for not enforcing the minimum size requirement. But the USDA tells the Seaquarium that the park exceeds minimum size requirements for the pool. PETA says even if Lolita can't be rehabilitated to return to the wild, the Washington state cove is much larger and her former killer whale pods will swim by her open water habitat. The Miami Seaquarium curator says there's no proof Lolita could survive in such a habitat. ""It would be reckless to treat her life as an experiment and jeopardize her health and safety.""

"Though Robert H. Richards IV was convicted of rape, the wealthy heir to the du Pont family fortune was spared prison by a Delaware court in 2009 because he would ""not fare well"" behind bars, according to court documents CNN obtained Tuesday. Richards is a great-grandson of the chemical magnate Irenee du Pont. He received an eight-year prison sentence in 2009 for raping his toddler daughter, but the sentencing order signed by a Delaware judge said ""defendant will not fare well"" in prison and the eight years were suspended. Richards was placed on eight years' probation and ordered to get treatment and register as a sex offender, the documents show. He was also prohibited from having contact with children under 16, including his own children. The documents were never sealed, yet the ruling managed to go unnoticed until March, when Richards' former wife, Tracy Richards, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Superior Court on behalf of their children alleging ""personal injuries arising from the childhood sexual abuse."" The 11-page suit alleges that not only was their daughter abused, but Richards abused their son, too. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages. While he was convicted of raping his daughter, Richards has never been charged with sexually molesting his son, according to Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Delaware attorney general's office. CNN tried repeatedly to reach Richards and Eugene Maurer, the attorney who represented him in 2009. Maurer is no longer representing Richards, his assistant told CNN on Wednesday. CNN asked if he had a comment; he has not offered one. Attorney John C. Balaguer is representing Richards in the civil case, his assistant told CNN. Balaguer has not returned e-mails or voice mail messages CNN has left for him. This week, after news of Richards' 2009 case came to light, many took to Twitter to criticize the judge in the case, saying that it echoed a recent Texas case in which a wealthy teenager driving drunk killed four people but received no jail time. Ethan Couch was sentenced last year to 10 years' probation. A witness in Couch's case claimed the teenager was a victim of ""affluenza"" -- the product of wealthy, privileged parents who never set limits for the boy. Delaware's Judicial Code of Conduct prohibits Judge Jan R. Jurden from discussing the 2009 ruling with reporters, court spokeswoman Amy Quinlan told CNN. But at least one member of the Delaware legal community came to Jurden's defense Tuesday. ""It's wrong to attribute (the 'defendant would not fare well' comment) to Judge Jurden,"" said Richard Kirk, a lawyer who is chairman of a Delaware State  Bar Association committee that he says steps up to respond ""when judges are criticized and unable to speak for themselves."" Kirk says the argument that Richards would not do well in prison could have been the recommendation of probation or parole officers. However, he said, ""common sense suggests that it came from defense counsel."" As for the prosecutor's side, the attorney general's spokesman gave CNN a written statement. ""Cases of child sexual abuse are extremely complicated and difficult,"" it read. The objective is to ""secure justice in every case to the best of its ability given the unique facts and circumstances presented in each case -- sometimes that results in a resolution that is less than what prosecutors would want,"" the statement read. ""In this particular case, the facts and circumstances made it unlikely that a conviction could be secured at trial. ...This resolution protected the victim and imposed conditions that would make it less likely the defendant could harm others.""","Robert Richards was convicted of raping toddler daughter in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- A Missouri VA hospital is under fire because it may have exposed more than 1,800 veterans to life-threatening diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. John Cochran VA Medical Center in St. Louis has recently mailed letters to 1,812 veterans telling them they could contract hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after visiting the medical center for dental work, said Rep. Russ Carnahan. Carnahan said Tuesday he is calling for a investigation into the issue and has sent a letter to President Obama about it. ""This is absolutely unacceptable,"" said Carnahan, a Democrat from Missouri. ""No veteran who has served and risked their life for this great nation should have to worry about their personal safety when receiving much needed healthcare services from a Veterans Administration hospital."" The issue stems from a failure to clean dental instruments properly, the hospital told CNN affiliate KSDK. KSDK: VA dental patients at risk of infection . Dr. Gina Michael, the association chief of staff at the hospital, told the affiliate that some dental technicians broke protocol by handwashing tools before putting them in cleaning machines. The instruments were supposed to only be put in the cleaning machines, Michael said. The handwashing started in February 2009 and went on until March of this year, the hospital told KSDK. The hospital has set up a special clinic and education centers to help patients who may have been infected. However, Carnahan said he feels more should be done and those responsible should be disciplined. ""I can only imagine the horror and anger our veterans must be feeling after receiving this letter,"" Carnahan said. ""They have every right to be angry. So am I."" This is not the first time this year a hospital has been in hot water for not following proper procedures. In June, Palomar Hospital in San Diego, California, has sent certified letters to 3,400 patients who underwent colonoscopy and other similar procedures, informing the patients that there may be a potential of infection from items used and reused in the procedures.","Missouri VA hospital sends letters to more than 1,800 patients at risk .

"Filmmaker J.J. Abrams loves a certain level of mystery, paranoia and hidden meaning in many of the movies and television series he's created: The enigmatic island in ""Lost."" The sci-fi conspiracy behind ""Fringe."" The monsters kept hidden through much of ""Super 8"" and ""Cloverfield."" Now, Abrams brings that same mysterious vibe to a new novel simply called, ""S."" The result of a collaboration between Abrams, who created the concept, and critically acclaimed author Doug Dorst, who wrote the book, ""S."" is part mystery, part romance and part puzzle -- an ambitious, multilayered and interactive story. (View the book's spooky trailer.) Even as ""S."" is being unveiled in stores this week, it's still shrouded in secrecy. The thick hardcover comes in a slipcase and shrink-wrapped in plastic. Inside is what appears to be an old library book, titled ""Ship of Theseus"" by a writer named V.M. Straka. It's a story about a man with no memory and no identity who is kidnapped and taken aboard a strange ship by a crew of mystery men. In the margins of the book are handwritten messages between two people; Jennifer, a college senior and Eric, a former graduate student. Both these stories unfold simultaneously and then intersect. The ""S."" experience is like reading a novel while eavesdropping on a conversation. Also moving the two stories forward, there are removable photos, postcards, letters, newspaper articles, even a map drawn on a napkin, folded into the book. Using these clues, Jen and Eric, and hopefully readers, too, discover hidden messages and codes that lead to the book's climax. CNN recently spoke to Abrams and Dorst about how their collaboration came together. An edited transcript of the conversation is below. Fast facts: J.J. Abrams & Doug Dorst . For fans of: Mysteries, romance, puzzles, experimental fiction, the TV series ""Lost"" What else have they done: Abrams is the writer, producer and director behind TV shows including ""Lost,"" ""Fringe"" and ""Person of Interest."" He also has directed a number of movies, including ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" and will direct the next chapter of the ""Star Wars"" franchise. Dorst is the author of the PEN/Hemingway-nominated novel ""Alive in Necropolis"" and the story collection ""The Surf Guru."" Fun Facts: Abrams is a huge fan of ""Downton Abbey"" and visited the set of the UK-based drama earlier this year. Dorst teaches writing at Texas State University-San Marcos. He's also a three-time ""Jeopardy!"" champion. CNN: What was the spark behind the book? Abrams: About 15 years ago I was at LAX and I saw a Robert Ludlum novel sitting on a bench. I went over and picked it up. Inside someone had written in pen on the title page of the book, ""to whomever finds this book please read it and take it somewhere and leave it for someone else to read."" I just loved this idea that someone would use a book as a means of communication. What happens if you read the notes in it, what if you responded to those notes? Could there be a story or maybe even a romance that begins between two people over a book? It was an idea I had for many years and finally I had to share it because it was driving me crazy. So we started trying to figure out: How do we make this happen? I was introduced to Doug Dorst, who came in and heard this crazy pitch that had a whole bunch of ideas but far more questions than answers. Dorst: So, I went away to try and figure out how this book is going to work, given the story we're going to try and tell, how do we do that? How is the inner novel going to function, who are the characters? I came up with some ideas and we went back and forth developing those for the better part of a year. Then we put together a sample and sold the book. Since then it's been about two years making the rest of the book happen. CNN: To me ""S."" reads as if Franz Kafka had written an episode of ""Lost."" How would you describe the novel to someone who hasn't read it? Dorst: I love that description. Add to it, they find H.P. Lovecraft in a bunker. Abrams: I think that it is a kind of wonderful cocktail of writing of a period, in a tone that feels really idiosyncratic but then it's got modern-day language and a very current rhythm. While there's an investigation into this author and the conspiracy that swirls around him, it's also a love story, actually more than one love story that develops. It's kind of a wonderful thing to see how it blossoms. I just think Doug truly outdid himself. CNN: With the hidden messages and codes, the postcards and photos folded into the book, did you set out to create more of an interactive experience for the reader? Abrams: When we first met it was part of our discussions that we wanted this thing to have not just notes inside but the idea that it could actually have some physical, tangible, removable pieces, of artifacts of their relationship and investigation in there. So it was part of the fun to imagine what it could be, but the truth is that kind of stuff can become gimmicky. Doug focused on telling the story, and it wasn't until we'd really finished the whole thing that the question came up: What would be the great wish list of things that we could have in there? Dorst: My wish list was ridiculously long, but that was part of the fun, too. There were times as I was writing it might occur to me that there would be some sort of exterior piece of information or document that might go with that nicely and I would make a note of it. We didn't really sit down to figure out which ones would serve the story best until later. Abrams: One of my favorites, there's this great letter from Jen and you realize there's no other way it would really fit in the book. It's a funny thing because when you're reading a book you're a little bit of a voyeur because you're entering into the author's world. The whole experience of ""S."" to me is literally almost reading someone's diary; it's actually two people's diaries. There are moments in the book that feel very personal and intimate. What I love about Doug's writing is those moments are earned. To me it transcends any gimmickry that the cautionary tale version of this book would end up looking like. CNN: What book first inspired you when you were young? Dorst: When I was a kid Stephen King's ""The Shining"" blew me away. That was the first book that just messed up my world in a really interesting and fun way. Later, when I was in law school and trying to get out, there was an amazing book by T.C. Boyle, ""World's End,"" that made me realize, oh people can be writers, maybe I could do this. Abrams: It's funny you say that, for me what I remember so clearly and I think I was 14 when ""Night Shift,"" the Stephen King short story collection came out. That blew my mind and I got obsessed with him and read ""The Dead Zone"" and ""The Shining"" and others. ""Night Shift"" did for me what ""The Twilight Zone"" did as a TV series. CNN: Will the two of you collaborate again? Abrams: There are some things that we've talked about that could be pretty exciting, but we'll see how people respond to ""S."" first.","""S."" is a collaboration between filmmaker J.J.

"Speed killed ""Fast & Furious"" star Paul Walker, according to the investigation of the fiery car crash that ended the actor's life last year. ""Investigators determined the cause of the fatal solo-vehicle collision was unsafe speed for the roadway conditions,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Commander Mike Parker said Tuesday. The high-performance 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was going ""between 80 and 93 mph at the time the car impacted a power pole and several trees,"" the final report said.  The posted speed limit on the Santa Clarita, California, office park road was 45 mph. The sheriff's conclusion is no surprise, since the coroner's report previously estimated the car was speeding at 100 mph.  But the investigative report does clear up some questions that have lingered about how Walker died. Walker, 40, and friend Roger Rodas, 38, had no drugs or alcohol in their blood. Both men were wearing seat belts.  The airbags deployed as they should have when the car clipped a light pole and several trees, investigators said. Nothing mechanical went wrong to cause their Porsche to leave the wide road.  Investigators found  ""no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision,"" the report said.  Experts from Porsche and Michelin were consulted. The car did have ""an aftermarket exhaust system"" that helped it go faster, the report said.   The tires on the car, which was mostly displayed in a showroom and rarely driven, were more than nine years old. One early theory -- considering the nature of Walker's movies -- that he and Rodas could have been racing another car was not supported, the report said. ""No eyewitness contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to say there was a second vehicle and there is no evidence to indicate there was a second car involved in the collision,"" it said.  Video recorded by several security cameras on nearby buildings ""helped skilled investigators to determine the cause of the collision and that no speed contest was taking place."" The Los Angeles County coroner's office released a15-page report in January that concluded the two men apparently did not live long after the crash. Walker and Rodas, racing team partners, left a charity event at a car shop co-owned by the men to take a ride in an office park in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood. The crash happened a few hundred yards away on a wide street. The autopsy revealed ""scant soot"" in Walker's trachea, suggesting his life ended before the smoke and fire engulfed the car. The actor's body was badly burned ""and in a pugilistic stance. His right wrist was fractured and his left arm was fractured,"" the report said. Rodas was also described as in ""a pugilistic"" -- or defensive -- position. Walker suffered fractures of his left jawbone, collarbone, pelvis, ribs and spine, the report said. Rodas ""rapidly died of severe blunt head, neck and chest trauma,"" the report said. Walker's death came during a Thanksgiving break in filming of ""Fast and Furious 7,"" forcing a halt in the production. Universal Studios eventually decided that the movie would be completed using scenes already filmed by Walker, but the release will be delayed from this summer until April 10, 2015.  Production resumed in Atlanta this month.","Drugs, alcohol, mechanical trouble, racing were not involved in Paul Walker's crash .

"(CNN)On the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, the life of a horse may be tracked down two distinct paths. One is long-lived, the horse bred to exhibit its utmost power and beauty. The other is cut straight to the bone, a life that is transient and transformed in an instant. Hajime Kimura's black-and-white photo series ""Tracks"" is a journey down both of those paths. Racehorse breeding has become a common practice and a significant economic activity for those in Hokkaido. From the moment a horse is born, it is inevitably subject to the watchful eyes of judgment. If born healthy, able to stand up strong on its newly formed young limbs, the pony will spend its life on the path to becoming a racehorse. But, if born with any kind of defect, the pony will instead tumble down a much darker path, slaughtered for both animal and human food consumption. Kimura's ""Tracks"" provides viewers with a direct view of the two distinct paths, from eager audiences waiting for the start of a horse race, to an eerily empty, lifeless stable. ""Tracks"" was certainly not an easy series for Kimura to undertake. ""The most tough part was that there was no slaughterhouse (that would) let me cover it,"" Kimura said via email. Through the introduction of a friend, however, Kimura was eventually able to photograph a small private farm after his two-month search. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""I felt a lot while shooting,"" Kimura said. ""The most emotional moment was when a horse was shot in its forehead with a gun. ... That was a thought-provoking time for me. I kept staring at the horse changing to meat. I've never seen such a thing before."" The ages of 16 and 21 are often viewed as significant moments in many people's lives, and this is especially true for Kimura. At 16, Kimura attended a horse race for the first time. Five years later, he ate horse meat. The combination of these two experiences led him on an investigation into the memories of his past. ""I wanted to understand how (my experiences) can connect,"" Kimura said. ""Tracks"" is ultimately a series in which Kimura descends deep into his memories in order to produce an emotional exploration of life and death. It leaves viewers to consider the distinction between the path of life and that of death: Is one path truly more bright and hopeful, or more dark and helpless, than the other? The decision to shoot in black and white is especially poignant. ""This world has color, as you know,"" Kimura said. ""But I want to see this world simpler. I want to see texture beyond the color, and I want you to evoke your imagination."" Kimura was raised in Chiba, a prefecture just outside of Tokyo. Having studied architecture and anthropology while in college, his career in photography began nine years ago. Since then, he has published two photo books, ""Kodama"" and ""Tokyo Etude,"" and has received several awards, including first prize for the IPA Photo Book Asia Award in 2013. What one finds consistent in all of Kimura's work is his endless curiosity about his surroundings and people. ""In my career in photography,"" he said, ""one thing I've always thought is my priority to enjoy the journey, the process. ... The important thing is to live my own life with curiosity, and then I can talk about photography."" Hajime Kimura is a Japanese photographer based in Tokyo. You can follow him on Instagram and Twitter.","Hajime Kimura's photo series ""Tracks"" focuses on horses' lives in Hokkaido, Japan .

"The decision by the Obama administration to intervene militarily in Iraq to prevent a potential ""genocide"" against a religious minority, could potentially strain relations with Sunnis, who constitute the overwhelming majority of Muslims in the Middle East and wider Muslim world. The U.S. has stepped in to protect the Yazidi minority, and to stem the mass expulsion of Christians from their towns by the al Qaeda offshoot, ISIS -- which is now calling itself the ""Islamic State"" or ""IS."" Most Arab and Muslim-majority nations have expressed their concern about the ascendancy -- and brutality -- of ISIS in Iraq, and have designated it as a terrorist organization. However, the framing of the U.S. intervention in ""humanitarian"" and religious terms is likely to bolster several, related narratives that claim that the U.S. formulates its foreign policy based on an unwritten commitment to certain religious groups and sects -- especially Christians and Shia -- and an animus towards other ones; Muslims in general but especially Sunnis. The more corrosive narratives morph into outlandish conspiracy theories that weaken U.S. standing in the Middle East and beyond and further inflame the sectarianism that was ignited by the war in Syria and that has spread across the Muslim world. Just as importantly, these accounts have been adopted by ISIS and other militant, Islamist groups to bolster their recruitment efforts. In short, they threaten to undermine U.S. interests and national security. The notion that the U.S. is at war with Islam has its roots in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Generations of Arabs -- Muslims and otherwise -- have been politically socialized to view the U.S. as the main patron of Israel, which is portrayed as a brutal ""Zionist"" state that has subjugated Palestinians and ""stolen"" their land. However, it was the war against Afghanistan in 2001, and subsequent invasion of Iraq in 2003 that framed the narrative more clearly in the minds of many as a general U.S. war against Muslims everywhere. As the war in Iraq became protracted , and a Shia-led government came to power, displacing the Sunni minority that had long dominated Iraqi politics, some mainstream Sunnis , as well as militants, started speaking about a ""Crusader, Safavid, Zionist"" alliance (the U.S., Iran, and Israel, respectively) that was conspiring against Sunnis. Al Qaeda's branch in Iraq succeeded in recruiting militants to fight the U.S. and Nouri Al Maliki's government by portraying him as an agent of Iran, a Shiite theocracy committed to the subjugation of Sunnis. However, it was the civil war in Syria, where the Alawite-led regime of Bashar al-Assad, brutally suppressed the Sunni majority, killing more than 100,000 people and displacing millions of others in the process, that allowed al Qaeda to craft a jihadist narrative that has resonated with militants around the world and made Syria their favorite destination. It is in that fertile ground that ISIS emerged and subsequently flourished. Within minutes of President Obama's statement explaining his two primary reasons for the intervention in Iraq -- the other being protecting U.S. personnel and facilities -- Arabic social media sites and discussion forums on the Internet were inundated with postings expressing a combination of disappointment, dismay and even anger. Many lamented the prospect of another U.S. ""invasion"" of Iraq. More pronounced was the tone of incredulity at the perceived unjust, double standard that the U.S. was displaying by acting in Iraq after it had refused to stop the carnage in Syria. In the minds of many, U.S. military action to protect Iraqi Yazidis and Christians, revealed U.S. ""compassion"" for Christians. Many asked rhetorically, ""Does the suffering of Syrians not count?"" The timing of the President's decision was a further complicating factor, coming on the heels of the latest round of violence between the Israeli government and the Islamist group Hamas in Gaza. The conflict dominated news cycles since it began on July 8, with images of dead Palestinian children broadcast on satellite news channels around the clock and shared thousands of times on Twitter and Facebook. A common sentiment was outrage at the perceived ""silence"" of the world. Elaborating on his reasons for authorizing the attacks in an interview over the weekend, President Obama said ""We're not going to let them create some caliphate through Syria and Iraq."" While the recent declaration by ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi that the ""caliphate"" had been reestablished -- and that all Muslims had to pledge allegiance to him -- fell on deaf ears across the Muslim world, President Obama's seemingly inadvertent use of the word caliphate reminded some of President George W. Bush's ill-advised use of the term ""crusade"" in the wake of the September 11 attacks to describe his ""war on terrorism."" While the use of such words is seen as unfortunate but largely innocuous in the West, in the Middle East and much of the wider Muslim world, moments like these breathe life into otherwise baseless conspiracies for generations. Those who are familiar with the dominant narrative in Pakistan understand that when it comes to U.S. officials, there is no such thing as a ""slip up"". For its part, ISIS and its sympathizers created multiple hashtags on Twitter within minutes of the President's announcement. While some promised that a ""calamity will befall"" the U.S., others stressed that the air strikes were just the latest in a long string of U.S. crimes against Muslims. To avoid perpetuating these destructive narratives, the U.S. must be careful in how it frames the intervention going forward. To avoid alienating over a billion Sunni Muslims around the world -- making some of them easy prey for ISIS and other militant organizations -- the U.S. should avoid using religious terminology and deemphasize the religion of both the victims and the aggressors.

"A new Justice Department panel is reviewing the police response to 16 days of protests and disturbances after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer. The so-called after-action review is taking a look at how officers from the Ferguson and St. Louis County police departments and the Missouri State Police handled everything from crowd control to arrests to interaction with the media, according to a Justice Department official. The 12-person team, which includes Justice Department officials and current and former police chiefs, is part of the federal response promised by Attorney General Eric Holder in response to the shooting and aftermath. The team started its assessment last week with a visit to Ferguson, conducting interviews with police officials and people who interacted with the police during the 16 days in August. They'll return several times in the coming weeks. Holder has been critical of the heavy-handed police response, which included phalanxes of armored police firing tear gas at demonstrators. Ronald Davis, who heads the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, has led efforts to train St. Louis area police to improve how they respond to protests. His office is also helping manage the after-action review. Despite police response problems already identified by Holder, Davis said the police review will be objective. The group doing the after-action assessment won't be ""naive of the facts"" that caused there to be a review in the first place, he said, but ""the assessment will be based on facts. We have to start with a very objective slate."" The first test of the new federal COPS training is expected soon, when a St. Louis County grand jury decides whether to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for shooting Brown. If the grand jury decides not to indict Wilson, it could spark new protests. Davis said Tuesday that his office has done a first round of training for 27 police commanders. The training covers everything from arrest practices to use of force. One focus of the training is the guardian vs. warrior mentality. The aim, Davis said, is to move police to embrace the guardian mentality, so they act as guardians of constitutional rights, instead of warriors, as their riot-control armor may suggest. The Justice Department is also conducting a separate civil rights investigation of the shooting and an investigation of the practices of the Ferguson Police Department.

"(CNN)Talk about gender transitioning may be swirling around Bruce Jenner, but the 1976 Olympic gold medalist has kept quiet. Who can blame him? Though the mainstream is increasingly aware of the various ways some people are modifying their gender presentations -- even in our Instagrammed, reality-show age -- it remains rare for people to do their transitioning in public. It's even more uncommon for someone already in the public eye to go through the process. If the rumors are true, Jenner may become an exception. His mother, Esther, recently spoke to The Associated Press about hobbies he intends to continue enjoying; ""family sources"" and ""an insider"" have spoken to TMZ and People magazine, respectively, providing droplets of gossip about Jenner. That part is no surprise. Jenner's ex-wife, Kris, is the matriarch of the Kardashian clan -- no strangers to growing up and showing off in public. However, while Esther Jenner and Kris' daughter Kim Kardashian have both publicly offered strong support for Bruce Jenner, neither has used the words ""transgender"" or ""transitioning"" with the media. CNN's repeated attempts to get comment from Jenner, his agents and his mother have gone unanswered. E!, which runs ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" and is reportedly working on a documentary with Jenner, has told CNN ""we're still not commenting."" And Jenner himself has said nothing publicly. Even the decathlon winner's website, brucejenner.com, consists of a cover page with a generic photo of runners at the starting line, a reference to him as ""the world's greatest athlete"" (as Olympic decathlon winners are sometimes called) and a small note that content is ""coming soon."" He reportedly does have an interview with Diane Sawyer in the works. There are a handful of relatively well-known people who have transitioned. They have also remained private during the process. Here are a few examples. Renee Richards . As Richard Raskind, Richards was a successful eye surgeon and, in her younger days, a highly regarded amateur tennis player. Her transition was carried out in private but became very public when she was outed by a San Diego TV reporter after a mid-'70s tennis tournament, which prompted the U.S. Tennis Association to ban her from the U.S. Open. As Michael Weinreb wrote in a 2011 Grantland profile, ""Until that moment, she had no intention of playing in the U.S. Open. Until that moment, Richards, already a well-respected eye surgeon, insists she had never really dreamed of a professional tennis career."" Richards won the right to play in the Open -- she lost the 1977 doubles final -- and became a sought-after coach, most notably with Martina Navratilova. A documentary about her life, ""Renee,"" premiered in 2011. Lana Wachowski . The older of the Wachowski siblings, creators of the ""Matrix"" trilogy and the newly released ""Jupiter Ascending,"" began modifying her gender presentation in the early 2000s. During Wachowski's transformation, friends and representatives publicly denied that the process was underway. As late as 2007, when the Wachowskis were making ""Speed Racer,"" columnist Roger Friedman quoted producer Joel Silver as saying, ""It's all untrue."" The insular Wachowskis had a no-press clause in their studio contract, so the chatter was not confirmed by the pair themselves. Wachowski came out as transgender in public in 2012. The pair was the subject of a major New Yorker profile in September 2012. ""My biggest fears were all about losing my family. Once they accepted me, everything else has been a piece of cake,"" Lana Wachowski told the magazine. ""I know that many people are dying to know if I have a surgically constructed vagina or not, but I prefer to keep this information between my wife and me."" Chaz Bono . The child of Sonny and Cher came out as a lesbian in 1995. In 2008, he began his gender transition, a process that was noted by his publicist in 2009. Bono's transition was the subject of a film, ""Becoming Chaz,"" in 2011. Since then, Bono is probably best known for competing on ""Dancing with the Stars."" He stays active in the entertainment business, promoting his weight loss on ""The Doctors"" and appearing in the forthcoming film ""Dirty."" Alexis Arquette . One of the acting Arquettes -- sibling of Rosanna, Patricia and David -- had roles in such films as ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" before transitioning in the early 2000s. The experience was the subject of a 2007 film, ""Alexis Arquette: She's My Brother."" Since then, Arquette has appeared in the TV series ""Californication"" and the films ""Here & Now,"" ""Getting Back to Zero"" and ""Blended."" Arquette has said she wants the focus to be on her art, not her body. ""When people ask me about my privates, I say: 'Unless you want to have sex with me, there's no point asking me. Unless you want to discriminate against me, I don't know why it would be an issue,' "" she told Out's Michael Musto in January. ""Why would you treat someone differently? You're gonna hold the door for me just because I have a vagina? It's nice to hold the door for everyone.""","Bruce Jenner is the subject of gender-transitioning rumors .

"(CNN)A Michigan man is accused of threatening to behead the police officer who put Eric Garner in a chokehold. Alvaro Eduardo Guzman-Telles, 29, said in a Facebook post in December he was ""going to personally kill and behead Daniel Pantaleo"" and that ""this is a written threat and has to be taken extremely seriously,"" the FBI alleges in a federal indictment. He was arrested last month and faces a charge of interstate transmission of threatening communications, according to the indictment. Pantaleo, a New York City police officer, put Garner in a chokehold while trying to arrest him last July on suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes. Garner died after the encounter, but a grand jury declined in December to indict Pantaleo, sparking large demonstrations across the nation. Guzman-Telles also allegedly said on Facebook to ""kill all cops on sight. No matter the circumstances."" The New York office of the FBI tracked the social media posts back to an address in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where Guzman-Telles' mother was questioned. She said she was aware of the postings and told her son to delete them for she feared the posts would get him in trouble, the FBI said.","Beheading threat made on Facebook against cop at center of Eric Garner controversy .

"Buenos Aires (CNN)The scandal enmeshing Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner already had a plot as twisted as a Machiavelli novel. But this week, it contorted again, when the country's former spy chief disappeared. Horacio Antonio Stiuso was supposed to testify  Thursday about the mysterious death of a special prosecutor, who had leveled scathing accusations at Fernandez. Authorities have not been able to find the ex-director of the Secretary of Intelligence, let alone notify him that he has been called to testify. The intrigue surrounding him, the dead prosecutor and the President dates back to 1994 -- when a car bomb demolished a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, killing 85 people. Special prosecutor Alberto Nisman implicated Iran in the attack, in his nearly 300-page investigation report. Then he accused Fernandez of covering up Tehran's involvement to sweeten a trade deal. Cash-strapped Argentina would allegedly get Iranian oil in exchange for meat and grain. Shortly after filing his report and one day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations in January, Nisman was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. In his trash can, investigators found a draft warrant for Fernandez's arrest. The President was quick to call it a suicide but changed her story a few days later. A test found no gunpowder residue on Nisman's hands, as would have been expected if he had pulled the trigger. Fernandez's government blamed the intelligence agency for his death, and the President filed a bill for the agency to be dissolved and replaced by the new Federal Intelligence Agency. The Senate took up debate on the bill on Wednesday. Supporters hope to have it on Fernadez's desk to sign by February 25. And she pointed the finger at Stiuso, accusing him of feeding Nisman false information and having a hand in his death. Stiuso was using Nisman to discredit her for firing Stiuso last year, she claimed. But Stiuso's replacement, Oscar Parrilli, reeled him back in -- not as an agent, but as a witness. On Thursday, the director said Fernandez would relieve Stiuso of his pledge of secrecy. ""The President of the nation has given us the directive and now we are going to work on preparing the authorization to relieve Mr. Stiuso of the obligation to keep secrets,"" Parrilli said. Though now allowed to testify, Stiuso can't been found. Iván Perez Sarmenti reported from Buenos Aires; and Ben Brumfield from Atlanta.

"(CNN)Middle school student Vidal Chastanet was simply stating his truth about the school principal who inspires him in his rough Brooklyn neighborhood. Featured in the wildly popular ""Humans of New York"" photo series in January, a picture of Chastanet along with his sentiments went viral, and a subsequent fundraiser pulled in more than $1 million for his school. That's how Chastanet, 13, ended up at the White House on Thursday. The young man; his inspirational principal, Nadia Lopez; and ""Humans of New York"" creator Brandon Stanton all got the chance to meet Obama. (That's Chastanet in Obama's seat  in the Oval Office.) ""You don't do things alone,"" Obama told Chastanet, according to Stanton's blog.  ""Nobody does things alone. Everybody always needs support. ""For a young man like you, you should never be too afraid or too shy to look for people who can encourage you or mentor you,"" Obama said. ""There are a lot of people out there who want to provide advice and support to people who are trying to do the right thing. So you'll have a lot of people helping you. Just always remember to be open to help. Never think that you know everything. And always be ready to listen."" It's been a wild ride for  Chastanet, Lopez and their school, Mott Hall Bridges Academy, a middle school in Brownsville, Brooklyn. It's known as a ""safe zone in a crime-plagued neighborhood."" After Vidal's post took off, Stanton launched a campaign in late January to benefit  the school through a summer trip to Harvard. The goal of the trip was to broaden students' horizons and expand their idea of their potential, Stanton wrote on the campaign page. The fundraising campaign's rapid success speaks in part to the reach of ""Humans of New York,"" which has a social media following of nearly 12 million on Facebook alone. It's also a testament to the ability of social media to breathe new life into a feel-good story. The first inspirational post featured a picture of Chastanet in a housing project in Brownsville. He describes Lopez as the most influential person in his life. ""When we get in trouble, she doesn't suspend us. She calls us to her office and explains to us how society was built down around us. And she tells us that each time somebody fails out of school, a new jail cell gets built. And one time she made every student stand up, one at a time, and she told each one of us that we matter."" In a posting on the ""Humans of New York"" Facebook page, Lopez talked about the discouragement she felt before the campaign. ""Before all of this happened for our school, I felt broken,"" she said. ""And I think the world felt a little broken too, because a lot of bad things have been happening lately, especially between black people and white people. But all of you gave people a reason to feel a little less broken."" The picture of Vidal has been widely shared and drew more than 1 million likes on the ""Humans of New York"" Facebook page, compelling Stanton to dig deeper. ""I ask people all the time about the most influential person in their life, and he was the first person who ever told me his principal,"" Stanton wrote in an email. ""Then when I met Ms. Lopez, I could not have been more impressed. She is a force of nature. When she let me sit in on a staff meeting, I got a front-row seat to the challenges that her school faces, and I wanted to be involved in the solution."" Lopez and Stanton discussed how the ""Humans of New York"" community could help further the school's vision, Stanton said in a Facebook post. They decided to create a fund to provide each incoming sixth-grade class a chance to get out of their neighborhood and visit Harvard University. ""This is a neighborhood that doesn't necessarily expect much from our children, so at Mott Hall Bridges Academy we set our expectations very high. We don't call the children 'students,' we call them 'scholars.' Our color is purple. Our scholars wear purple, and so do our staff,"" Lopez told Stanton, who featured her picture on ""Humans of New York."" ""Because purple is the color of royalty. I want my scholars to know that even if they live in a housing project, they are part of a royal lineage going back to great African kings and queens. They belong to a group of individuals who invented astronomy and math. And they belong to a group of individuals who have endured so much history and still overcome. When you tell people you're from Brownsville, their face cringes up. But there are children here that need to know that they are expected to succeed."" The campaign's scope has expanded as its pot has grown. Initially, it was intended to cover lodging and transportation costs for three Mott Hall classes to make the trip to the Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus. In an update Friday, Stanton said that funds raised beyond the initial goal would go toward summer programming for the school. ""Learning stops during the summer for my scholars. We have what is called a 'summer slide,' "" Lopez says on the fundraising campaign page. ""They need a safe place where they can do activities and continue to grow their minds."" Stanton posted that because of the campaign's success, ""We are starting a scholarship fund available to the graduates of Mott Hall Bridges Academy. A committee of MHBA educators and administrators will choose the recipients each year."" The scholarship fund will be named for Vidal, the student who started it all, who will be the fund's first recipient, Stanton announced.","A ""Humans of New York"" portrait inspires a visit to White House .

"(CNN)When people think of a city that stands in for a dystopian society, they might think of Atlanta because it's the home of the TV mega-hit ""The Walking Dead."" What they may not think of is Katniss Everdeen. The sequels in the popular ""Hunger Games"" movie saga were all filmed in Atlanta, including the No. 1 movie of 2014, ""Mockingjay Part 1."" So was the film adaption of ""Divergent"" and its upcoming sequel ""Insurgent."" Fans have flocked to the city to find some of their favorite spots, though many of them may not be obvious: Enter Atlanta Movie Tours, which has seen success with two tours based on ""The Walking Dead."" ""Film and television tourism in Georgia has exploded in the past five years, and we would like to think we have had a hand in that,"" founder Carrie Sagel Burns said. ""Bringing the tourism aspect to what the state and production companies are doing makes it more 'real' to people."" Georgia -- along with New Mexico and Louisiana -- has seen a moviemaking boom in recent years, so those looking to see where their favorite scenes were shot no longer need to fly to Hollywood or New York. In Atlanta, the gorgeous Swan House -- part of the Atlanta History Center -- stood in for President Snow's mansion in the ""Hunger Games"" franchise, and the Goat Farm Arts Center was a location for many important scenes as Katniss' home of District 12. Those are among the sites one sees on the $65 Girl on Fire Tour, along with a heaping helping of information on the making of the movies and where the cast hung out when not filming. Atlanta Movie Tours boasts of many connections in the Georgia film industry, but when it came to pinpointing the top-secret ""Hunger Games"" locations, ""a lot of what we did involved good old-fashioned detective work,"" Burns said. CNN's Janelle Davis contributed to this report.","""Hunger Games"" fans can find many of the locations for the saga in Atlanta .

"Freetown, Sierra Leone (CNN)I started working at the Ebola treatment center the day it opened, September 19. I cared for children, men and women with Ebola. Every day more than 100 new patients came in. It was so serious. I wasn't afraid. I was determined to make the outbreak go away from my country. Every day I saw thousands of people from my country dying. Blood in their vomit, blood coming from their eyes, their ears, their mouth, their nose... One day in November, I felt sick. I started to vomit, my body ached. I thought it was an ulcer like before. My mother said, ""Let's go to the hospital."" We called my boss and he said, ""Bring her immediately."" They isolated me, took blood samples, and treated me with IV fluids because I was vomiting seriously. Within 24 hours, they came back. They were all wearing protective clothing and equipment. It was then that I knew. Tears streamed down my face. Immediately they took me into the red zone, the same place where I treat my patients. I was now like them. In three days, I could not walk. I was blind, paralyzed, unable to talk or eat. I had a sore throat, body aches and my whole body itched. Blood started coming out of my eyes. I couldn't sleep. I was awake with pain all of the time. Once, my soul left my body. I saw my body lying down. I almost went insane. I thought, I am going to die, I will not make it. Every single day I cried. Ebola is a very dangerous disease. During this time, my parents were quarantined. No one could visit me. All of my belongings -- my bed, my clothes, my shoes -- were burned. The first thing that happened when I started to feel better is that I was able to eat. I realized, ""God still has plans for me."" It took one month to relearn how to talk, to walk, to eat. When I left the hospital in December, it was not easy. My mom, dad, brothers and sisters embraced me, but others turned their back on me. My friends were scared they would get Ebola. People pointed at me in the street. My parents and I had to leave our community and find a new place to live, far away, where people did not know. I often say Ebola is a demonic disease, because of what it does to you when you are sick and what it does to you after. I have many friends who died from Ebola. In the hospital ward where I worked, all my medical colleagues who got Ebola died except me. One of my friends lost every member of her family. Ebola is also demonic because of the stigmatization you face as a survivor. I always try to stay positive, even though it is hard for me, physically and emotionally. After surviving, I returned to work in the same hospital ward where I worked before, treating Ebola patients and giving them hope. I tell them I was a victim of Ebola, and I survived. When they refuse medication, I make an example of myself. I say, ""I want you to do the same thing to be like me."" Just before returning to work, I met World Health Organization Director-General, Dr. Margaret Chan, when she visited our hospital. She hugged me and it felt so good. Her gesture showed everyone that they do not need to be scared. You should not reject survivors, you should embrace them. Then, Dr. Chan invited me to give the keynote address at the WHO's Ebola Special Session in Geneva. I am twice a survivor. I lived through war in my country. During the war, my sister was shot and killed in front of me. I fainted and they set our home on fire. The heat from the fire woke me up and I survived. I faced stigmatization then, for two years in Guinea, where they told refugees like us to sit on the floor of the bus. In many ways, Ebola is worse than war. With war, at least some of your family has a chance to survive. With Ebola, your entire family can be wiped out. Even if I have an enemy, I will never pray they become infected with Ebola. I will never think that. I want to help Ebola survivors. I started a non-governmental organization, Pink Cross, to provide counseling for Ebola survivors facing stigmatization and to conduct public awareness campaigns. We are looking for a partner to help us build post-Ebola drop-in centers for Ebola survivors to come for counseling, support and training. And I would like to further my education, so that I can pursue a career in my country helping people prevent and survive diseases like Ebola.","Rebecca Johnson cared for children, men and women with Ebola in Sierra Leone .

"(CNN)Imran Khawaja left London to train with a terror group in Syria last year and rose in the ranks, eventually appearing in one of its online promotional videos holding a severed head to the camera, authorities say. Sometime later, the group announced he was dead -- but police say it was only a ruse, uncovered when he was arrested trying to re-enter the United Kingdom. Khawaja, 27, was sentenced Friday in Woolwich Crown Court to 12 years in prison, having pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism and other terror-related charges, London's Metropolitan Police said. ""Khawaja chose to become a terrorist, engaged in weapons training in a terrorist training camp and faked his own death in order to conceal his entry back into the UK,"" Metropolitan Police counterterrorism Cmdr. Richard Walton said Friday. ""This sentence sends a powerful message to those who plan or prepare acts of terrorism overseas or here in the UK."" Authorities say Khawaja, of west London, traveled to Syria in January 2014 and joined Rayat al Tawheed, a group aligned with ISIS, the brutal terror group that has captured parts of Syria and Iraq for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. Eventually, he took the name Abu Daigham al-Britani and appeared in one of the group's promotional videos featuring the training camp and encouraging others to join it, police said. In a separate video posted on social media, police say, a man with his face covered is seen with a bag of severed heads. He picks up one of the heads, according to police, and shows it to the camera. Police say a description with the video reads: ""British ISIS fighter Abu Daigham al-Britani with Government soldier's head Syria."" In May, the group sent a message on social media claiming that Abu Daigham al-Britani had been killed -- news reported at the time by the British media. Khawaja, however, was arrested on June 3 after entering the United Kingdom at the port city of Dover, Metropolitan Police said. ""The images and video of Khawaja in Syria are horrific and deeply disturbing. He was a senior figure in Rayat al Tawheed, a group aligned to the Islamic State terrorist group that celebrated its terrorist acts through social media back to the UK,"" Walton said. Arrested with Khawaja was his cousin Tahir Bhatti, 45, on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police said they searched addresses linked to both men, and found messages and photographs that showed Khawaja had engaged in terrorist training in Syria, including how to handle weapons. Khawaja pleaded guilty in December to preparation of acts of terrorism, attending a terrorist training camp, weapons training and possession of an article for terrorist purposes. Bhatti pleaded guilty last month to assisting an offender and was sentenced Friday to 21 months in prison, Metropolitan Police said. A second man accused of helping Khawaja, Asim Ali, 33, of west London, was arrested in August. He was accused of, among other things, giving Khawaja money before Khawaja left for Syria. Ali pleaded guilty in December to entering a funding arrangement for the purposes of terrorism. He was sentenced Friday to 21 months in prison, Metropolitan Police said.","Police say Imran Khawaja, of west London, trained with a terror group in Syria last year .
